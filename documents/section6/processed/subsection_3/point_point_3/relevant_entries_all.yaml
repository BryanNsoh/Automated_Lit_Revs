    \ \n  \n1. Introduction  \nIndia has 16% of world papulation but have 4% of world’s\
    \ fresh water resources out of which 80% is used \nfor agriculture [1]. India\
    \ is known as agricultural country as 80% of its rural papulation have agriculture\
    \ as their \nsource of livelihood [2]. Many states of India have their agriculture\
    \ totally dependent on rainfall due to very less \navailability of freshwater.\
    \ This shortage of freshwater supply demands paradigm shift to productivity per\
    \ unit of \nwater. In various economic surveys done in past five years it is indicated\
    \ that adoption of advancement in \ntechnologies is required to make agriculture\
    \ sector sustainable for small and marginal farmers. Climatic changes \nthat are\
    \ affecting country in various ways, are going to lower farmer’s income further\
    \ by 25%. Three factors \nunder climate change pointed are decline in average\
    \ rainfall, rise in temperature and more dry days. India’s 73.2 \nmillion hectares\
    \ area is still unirrigated area and only rainfall dependent out of 141.4 million\
    \ hectares net sown \narea. Economic Survey alerted and recommended the requirement\
    \ for “dramatic” improvement in irrigation by \ninvolving new technologies [3].\
    \ In traditional farming irrigation is either done by manual observation of farmer\
    \ \nor it is scheduled irrigation. Additionally, water overuse can cause water\
    \ shortage, often occurs in areas of \nirrigation agriculture, and harms the environment.\
    \ Present scenario demands novel technology for increasing the \ncrop productivity,\
    \ and a technology to reduce the water consumption for irrigation. This is clearly\
    \ indicating a \ntransformation of traditional farming to Precision agriculture.\
    \ Precision Agriculture (PA) not only increases crop \nyield and revenues but\
    \ also involves methods which are very environment friendly. Precision agriculture\
    \ is a way \nof farming which is done by considering all the elements related\
    \ to soil moisture and temperature, environment \ndetails like temperature, humidity\
    \ and rate of evaporation measured by technology-based devices. Precision \nagriculture\
    \ is done more precisely on the basis of what is required, when is required and\
    \ where is required in the \nfarm. Precision farming is a technique of farming\
    \ that changes the use of pesticides and fertilizers to evaluate the \nvariation\
    \ in the growth conditions within the agriculture field. This way of practice\
    \ is termed as Site Specific \nManagement (SSM) [4]. This way it reduces the amount\
    \ of chemicals released into the environment. Precision \nagriculture also helps\
    \ in reducing the requirement of man power which further helps farmers to have\
    \ more \neconomic benefits. Advancement in Cloud Computing, Big Data Analytics,\
    \ Artificial Intelligence and Internet of \nthings are very helpful to attain\
    \ Precision agriculture. This review paper is focused on Internet of things and\
    \ \nvarious techniques used in this field to agriculture technology based. \n\
    \  2. Precision Agriculture \nPrecision agriculture is management of farming on\
    \ basis of observation, measurement and decision-based \nsystem. First revolution\
    \ of precision agriculture started with use machinery in place of manpower and\
    \ farming \nwith help of animals. This revolution happened in early 19s (1900-1930).\
    \ Second wave started with green \nrevolution which enhanced agriculture on the\
    \ basis genetics which led to precise plantation. Presently, third wave \nof revolution\
    \ is going on which came into implementation in 1980 with the advanced technologies\
    \ in agriculture \n[5]. The main focus of the review article is to study various\
    \ methods opted by different researchers in past five \nyears for smart farming.\
    \ Various technologies that are helping different researchers are Big Data Analytics,\
    \ Cloud \nComputing, Internet of Things, Wireless sensor network, Artificial intelligence,\
    \ Image processing using \nRana Gill  a, and Dr. Paras Chawla b \n \n132  \nComputer\
    \ vision and many more. These technologies are helping to transform traditional\
    \ farming to precision \nagriculture at very fast pace. Various technologies used\
    \ in precision agriculture are shown below in figure1 [6]. \n \nFig. 1.  Overview\
    \ of Precision Agriculture Technologies \nThis article is framed to cover only\
    \ those research article which Internet of things based. The survey presents \n\
    the idea of Precision agriculture with various innovations from its cause, various\
    \ technologies and their up-\ngradations ideas. Precision Agriculture utilizes\
    \ Internet of things (IoT) arrangements to increase productivity \nwhile reducing\
    \ water consumption, manpower required and saving environment. In the early stages,\
    \ Precision \nagriculture consisted mostly of map-based technologies using geo\
    \ statistical methods such as GIS and satellite \nbased remote sensing. And main\
    \ focus was to apply to control fertilizer use. Earlier sensors were not commonly\
    \ \nused because of high cost, unreliable or unavailable for necessary applications.\
    \ Precision agriculture got started \nin its third wave during 1980s but till\
    \ early 2000s not adopted by many farmers. The key obstacles to the adoption \n\
    of such approaches were the lack of technology, lack of scientific evidence, no\
    \ training and high cost [7]. \nDecreased sensors cost and rapid Internet of Things\
    \ (IoT) and Big data growth lead to development and testing \nof more PA system.\
    \ IoT works in form of cycle that firstly do monitoring with the help of sensor,\
    \ analysis of \ninformation gathered and then control [8]. Further by involving\
    \ Big data Analytics and machine learning decision \nmaking system can be designed\
    \ [9].  \n2.1 Internet of Things \nIn agriculture the Internet of Things is about\
    \ cameras, sensors and other smart devices to get data from every \naction in\
    \ farm. Internet of things helps to build smart farming in various forms like\
    \ sensing, watermanagement to \nincrease crop yield, determine fertizer requirement,\
    \ finding optimal time for planatation and harveting and \nweather conditions.\
    \ IoT is a type of enviornment in which objects can transmit data over internet\
    \ without or with \nminimal human interventation [10]. The IoT is designed around\
    \ various wireless radio standards which are \nresponsible for interaction of\
    \ different devices with each other through the Internet. It comprises many standards\
    \ \nlike Zigbee, Bluetooth, LoWPAN, Wi-Fi ,NFC, Z WAVE, RFID, and so on. Physical\
    \ object which collects and \nprocesses data that it receives about the enviornment\
    \ [11]. These objects are built with sensors, actuators, \nmicrocontrollers and\
    \ transceivers. The irrigation requirements can easily be automated by the IoT-\
    \ driven decision \nsupport system (DSS). In [22] authors proposed system to transmit\
    \ information through the internet with the help \nof internet of things The IoT\
    \ allows devices to control remotely or sense physical environmental factors using\
    \ \nsensor nodes. The user interface is generated with the help of an Android\
    \ app. The data gathered by the sensor \nnodes propagates following tree topology\
    \ to reach the base station. Arduino UNO and nodeMCU are used for \ntransmission\
    \ and soring the data collected to the cloud. Developed Android app enables the\
    \ access of an \ninformation uploaded to the cloud.  \nVarious technologies are\
    \ growing under internet of things and many methods are proposed and implemented\
    \ \nby various researchers in recent years. \n 2.1.1 Wireless Sensor Network \
    \ \nWireless sensor Networks help in shift from traditional farming to smart farming.\
    \ Research on Precision \nagriculture from basic climate information, soil information\
    \ to decision support system for irrigation are \ndependent on collection of data\
    \ by wireless sensors. The wireless sensor system not only improves crop \nproductivity\
    \ but also helps in saving environment in various forms [12].  A WSN usually consists\
    \ of many multi- \nfunctional sensor nodes that are deployed in a interested field.\
    \ With the recent advancements these nodes are of \nlow cost, less power consumption\
    \ and small in size. In spite of miniature structure these nodes are provisioned\
    \ \nwith sensors, microcontrollers, and radio transceivers. These nodes have capability\
    \ to sense the data, process it \nand capable to communicate it. These nodes are\
    \ capable to communicate over short distance via wireless mode \nTh\ne \nMo\n\

    \ \n133  \nof communication. Wireless communication standards plays an important\
    \ role for normal functioning of wireless \nsensor network. Various techniques\
    \ are designed at physical layer and protocols are followed at higher layers for\
    \ \neffective working of wireless sensor network. Nodes are generally categorises\
    \ as a source node and  a sink or \ngateway node. The collection of data is done\
    \ by source node and receiving of data is by sink or gateway node. In \nterms\
    \ of computational power sink nodes have higher power in comparison to a source\
    \ node. While choosing \nwireless nodes constraints faced are size, data rate,\
    \ memory and power consumption. In [13] comparison of sensor \nnodes used in precision\
    \ agriculture is done with their specification and it is considered that MICA2\
    \ is more \nsuitable due to its capability to connect with many sensors  with\
    \ help of its large expansion connectors. In recent \nmany ways are opted by different\
    \ researchers to apply wireless sensor network to agriculture. In [14] method\
    \ \nproposed to monitor agriculture environment was based on smart wireless sensor\
    \ network. They design an \narchitecture by deploying various nodes in the agriculture\
    \ area. Then collected data was analysed and displaying \nit to end user. Similarly,\
    \ In [15] authors  proposed a technique which applies on top surface of the soil\
    \ in two \ndomains namely time and space to monitor variation in soil moisture\
    \ content. This experiment has conducted by \nconsidering twenty seven different\
    \ locations where wireless sensor nodes have deployed. To collect real-time \n\
    data multi hope configuration has been used. In [16] paper has wireless sensor\
    \ network based smart system used \nin a red bayberry greenhouse. A smart system\
    \ is designed using temperature sensors and soil moisture. This \nsystem monitor\
    \ the humidity ,temperature and illumination in the greenhouse. In [17] authors\
    \ proposed wireless \nsensor networks based system in potato farm which monitors\
    \ individual crop requirements. The farmers can easily \nrecognise the different\
    \ requirements of crop ,fertilizers use and need of irrigation. The article presented\
    \ a model \nfor irrigation management to figure out agricultural parameters using\
    \ intelligent humidity sensors and \nmathematical calculations on the basis of\
    \ received input. In [18] authors  presented smart precision agriculture \nsystem\
    \ using IoT technology and wireless sensor network . This system has designed\
    \ automated irrigation system. \nComparison of scheduled irrigation in which irrigation\
    \ is done at specific times with automatic irrigation system \nbased on  moisture\
    \ sensors, temperature, and humidity. Two irrigation methods are compared and\
    \ it is found that \nautomatic irrigation has better efficiency in terms of water\
    \ consumption. In [19] proposed method is implemented \nby dividing the agricultural\
    \ land in for regions and three different sensors namely temperature, humidity\
    \ and soil \nmoisture sensor. Data collection is done by these sensor nodes and\
    \ transmitted through other nodes and gateways \nto server. Data received at server\
    \ is analysed and displayed in an application in GUI that can be made available\
    \ \nin mobile application and on the related website. In [20] authors developed\
    \ IoT-enabled wireless sensor network \nenvironment to monitor soil and environmental\
    \ parameters which are used to schedule irrigation on the basis of \nwater requirements.\
    \ Developed robust mechanism using interpolation technique for making soil moisture\
    \ content \ndistribution map. Method  made distribution map  by measuring soil\
    \ moisture content at different nine positions \nof the agricultural land. Structural\
    \ similarity index (SSIM) mechanisms was adopted to control irrigation valves\
    \ \ndepending on zone-specific irrigation control commands. In [21] a wireless\
    \ drip irrigation system was presented \nby deploying soil moisture sensors. An\
    \ implementation of a WSN was realized for wireless managed irrigation \nsolution\
    \ and real time monitoring of soil water content. Data collection is done with\
    \ the help of solar powered \nbased wireless acquisition stations to automate\
    \ an irrigation. With this system design monitoring of water content \nwas done.\
    \ It is clear from above reviewed papers that proposed systems use multiple sensors\
    \ nodes to make \nagriculture more precise. The design of the system is selected\
    \ depending on various features that fulfil the \nrequirement for low cost , less\
    \ power consumption, less water consumption, reduced manpower and secure \nwireless\
    \ communication between these nodes [23].  \nIn the agriculture sector wireless\
    \ sensor networks are being used to develop smart irrigation systems, smart \n\
    fertilization systems, crop health monitoring, early crop disease detection and\
    \ smart pest control systems.  \n  2.1.2 IoT Connectivity \nIn IoT objects can\
    \ talk and this is possible only through their connectivity to each other and\
    \ to the outside \nworld. Due to the rapid growth in WSN technologies and IoT\
    \ devices several wireless communication protocols \nare brought in use. These\
    \ protocols have their own specifications depending on various factors like data\
    \ rate, \nbandwidth, free channels, , battery life and cost [24]. Commonly used\
    \ protocol for IoT connectivity in agriculture \nsector are Zigbee, Bluetooth,\
    \ 6LoWPAN, RFID, Wi-Fi and Lora WAN.  ZigBee is a wireless protocol commonly \n\
    used in precision agriculture applications like smart irrigation systems and smart\
    \ greenhouses [25]. In [26], \nauthors presented a smart irrigation system in\
    \ which communication is handled by the ZigBee module. This \nsystem used two\
    \ nodes, i.e., a sensor node and an actuator node where sensor node was comprised\
    \ of soil moisture \nsensors, which were used to monitor the water level in the\
    \ soil and the actuator module used to take required \nactions on basis of the\
    \ water content of the soil. ZigBee protocol handled the whole communication part\
    \ of the \nsystem. In [27] wireless greenhouse sensors based on CC2420 and Zigbee.\
    \ In [28] greenhouse environment \nmonitoring system using three sensors namely\
    \ light intensity sensor, air temperature sensor and humidity sensor \nwas designed.\
    \ The system monitoring is Wi-Fi based which converts TTL signal from the sensor\
    \ to the Wi-Fi \nsignal to be transmitted to the server. In this framework physical\
    \ devices are connected to Wi-Fi network to \nmonitor and control greenhouse environment.\
    \ Similarly, In another smart agriculture system proposed in [29] \nWi-Fi protocols\
    \ were used. In this paper system is designed using Raspberry Pi   and multiple\
    \ sensors used for \ndata collection. The transmission of this data to the cloud\
    \ is done using Wi-Fi protocols.  Indu and S.R.N. [30] \nproposed a GSM(Global\
    \ system for mobile communication) based system to control irrigation. The system\
    \ \ndesigned is used to set the irrigation time depending on the data collected\
    \ by temperature and humidity sensors \nwhich helps to irrigate automatically\
    \ when unattended. Communication between the end user and system is \nRana Gill\
    \  a, and Dr. Paras Chawla b \n \n134  \nestablished via short messaging service\
    \ (SMS) on GSM network. In [31], a proposed system used smart phone \nusing Bluetooth\
    \ to collect the data from sensors deployed in the farm. Sensors used in the system\
    \ are soil \ntemperature sensor and soil moisture sensor. In [32] a smartphone\
    \ App is designed which enables the Wi-Fi \nconnection of the smartphone creating\
    \ an access point to a router node. This node is connected through the Zigbee\
    \ \nprotocol to a gateway that controls the irrigation pump. In [33], authors\
    \ presented wireless sensor network to \nmonitor the soil properties of the farm\
    \ by using a 6LoWPAN. 4G cellular technology is also considered as a good \nchoice\
    \ in underground wireless sensor networks [34]. Common IoT applications which\
    \ use RFID are security, \nmedical, smart shopping and smart agriculture. RFID\
    \ based smart irrigation system was presented in [35] which \nused soil moisture\
    \ and soil temperature sensors for controlling valve of irrigation pump. An information\
    \ collected \nby these sensors is transmitted to the cloud based on RFID wireless\
    \ communication protocols, with the help of \nwhich user can control a water pump.\
    \  \n  3. Precision Agriculture Challenges \nPrecision agriculture is in use from\
    \ last few decades to increase crop productivity by keeping low cost and \nless\
    \ human intervention. But still very limited farmers have adopted these techniques\
    \ due to several challenges. \nAs Precision agriculture relies on different sensors\
    \ which have certain limitations like deployment, development \ncost and maintenance\
    \ cost. So this hardware cost is main challenge in precision agriculture. Atmospheric\
    \ \ndisturbances also cause interference in wireless communication channels which\
    \ can further interrupt \ncommunication between wireless nodes and cloud. In Precision\
    \ agriculture systems large amounts of data get \ngenerated which need storage\
    \ and data analysis. New facilities and software platforms are in demand for \n\
    management of data. Literacy and connectivity are another important factors that\
    \ affects the adoption of smart \nfarming. The main challenge that is acting as\
    \ an obstruction in growth of precision agriculture is interoperability. \n 4.\
    \ Conclusion and Future scope \nPrecision agriculture with involvement of technologies\
    \ like IoT and wireless sensor networks helps to increase \nyield and productivity\
    \ with resource optimization. Most of the research articles in this field indicates\
    \ that precision \nagriculture is about sustainability and decision support systems.\
    \ Precision agriculture includes multiple \nparameters like temperature, soil\
    \ moisture, light intensity, humidity, soil nutrients, etc. Many challenges are\
    \ also \ninvolved in the system developed for precision agriculture. New software\
    \ platforms and advanced technologies \ncan further help in development of smart\
    \ agriculture. \nReferences \nA. C. Jose, “Improving home automation security;\

    \ the past years, governments, industries, and researchers have shown increasing\n\
    interest in incorporating smart techniques, including sensor monitoring, real-time\
    \ data transmitting,\nand real-time controlling into water systems. However, the\
    \ design and construction of such a smart\nwater system are still not quite standardized\
    \ for massive applications due to the lack of consensus on\nthe framework. The\
    \ major challenge impeding wide application of the smart water network is the\n\
    unavailability of a systematic framework to guide real-world design and deployment.\
    \ To address this\nchallenge, this review study aims to facilitate more extensive\
    \ adoption of the smart water system, to\nincrease eﬀectiveness and eﬃciency in\
    \ real-world water system contexts. A total of 32 literature pieces\nincluding\
    \ 1 international forum, 17 peer-reviewed papers, 10 reports, and 4 presentations\
    \ that are\ndirectly related to frameworks of smart water system have been reviewed.\
    \ A new and comprehensive\nsmart water framework, including deﬁnition and architecture,\
    \ was proposed in this review paper.\nTwo conceptual metrics (smartness and cyber\
    \ wellness) were deﬁned to evaluate the performance\nof smart water systems. Additionally,\
    \ three pieces of future research suggestions were discussed,\ncalling for broader\
    \ collaboration in the community of researchers, engineers, and industrial and\n\
    governmental sectors to promote smart water system applications.\nKeywords: smart\
    \ water system; framework; smartness; cyber wellness\n1. Introduction\nThe world’s\
    \ urban population has grown rapidly from 1.019 billion in 1960 to 4.117 billion\
    \ in\n2017 [1]. It is estimated that the population will reach 9.7 billion by\
    \ 2050 [2]. The excessive population\ngrowth will cause urgent water problems\
    \ like water shortage and water quality degradation in urban\nareas. In the 21st\
    \ century, the global water sector faces quality and quantity challenges, which\
    \ are\nhighly related to climate change and population growth [3]. The 2018 Global\
    \ Risk Report shows that\nmost of the high risks (high-likelihood and high-impact)\
    \ issues are water-related either directly or\nindirectly and are currently being\
    \ exacerbated by climate change [4]. Water crises have become one of\nthe ﬁve\
    \ most signiﬁcant risks in terms of their societal impacts. Additionally, the\
    \ breaking of economic\ngrowth and unbalanced urbanization can also contribute\
    \ to water shortage [5,6]. It is predicted that\ndue to population and industrial\
    \ growth the percentage of water scarcity will increase by 50% in\ndeveloping\
    \ countries and decrease by 18% in developed countries by 2025 [7]. One upcoming\
    \ water\nscarcity event will occur in Cape Town, where it is supposed to be the\
    \ ﬁrst city to experience day zero\nbut will not be the last if these threats\
    \ still hold [8,9].\nWater 2020, 12, 412; doi:10.3390/w12020412\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/water\n\
    Water 2020, 12, 412\n2 of 25\nHowever, due to the growing complications of water-related\
    \ issues such as water shortage, water\ndeterioration, and aging infrastructure,\
    \ traditional techniques, and management for drinking water\nsupply have gradually\
    \ shown their drawbacks and incapability to address these water issues [10].\n\
    Climate change and anthropic activities exacerbate the water issues by reducing\
    \ water quantity\nand deteriorating water quality. Especially, the limited eﬀort\
    \ on ecological maintenance results in\nthe pollution being increasingly found\
    \ in the water distribution system for the public around the\nworld. There is\
    \ an urgent need for modernized water supply technologies to alleviate current\
    \ water\nconcerns by improving water supply eﬃciency and approaching sustainable\
    \ water management\nglobally [11]. Traditionally, engineers and researchers get\
    \ used to re-sizing water supply systems.\nHowever, upgrading the existing water\
    \ distribution network is time-consuming and costly. Instead,\nretroﬁtting the\
    \ water system with smart components such as sensors, controllers, and a data\
    \ center\ncan achieve real-time monitoring, transmitting, and controlling in water\
    \ systems for decision-makers,\nwhich is a more cost-eﬀective and sustainable\
    \ approach to address the water challenges [12].\nTo date, automated control technology\
    \ (ACT) and information communication technology (ICT)\nare applied to tackle\
    \ existing problems in water distribution networks, where both technologies play\n\
    critical roles in large-scale ACT and ICT applications. A number of study cases\
    \ around the world\nconsider using smart water metering to monitor the water consumption\
    \ and further track leakage and\npipe burst issues in water distribution networks\
    \ [7]. The real-time measurements can be utilized to\nimprove the accuracy of\
    \ hydraulic model calibration and forecasting. Real-time control is commonly\n\
    applied in pumping, valve operation, and scheduling. The water supply eﬃciency\
    \ signiﬁcantly beneﬁts\nfrom automatic control technology but the electricity\
    \ energy eﬃciency needs optimization in practical\napplicability. If matched with\
    \ appropriate and eﬀective ICT or ACT solutions, in the form of a smart\nwater\
    \ system (SWS), city-wise water issues can be appropriately addressed and managed\
    \ [13]. In SWS,\nprogress can be made via smart metering (real-time monitoring\
    \ that transmits data to the utility) and\nintelligent controlling (real-time\
    \ feedback and action). For example, the Western Municipal Water\nDistrict (WMWD)\
    \ of California utilities have used the SCADA system to manage real-time alarms\
    \ and\nautomatically operate plants and networks [14]. The implementation of SCADA\
    \ has been associated\nwith 30% savings on energy use, a 20% decrease in water\
    \ loss, and a 20% decline in disruption [15].\nIn Brisbane City, Australia, the\
    \ web-based communication and information system tools are used\nby governments\
    \ and municipalities to deliver relevant water information to the public, as well\
    \ as\nto provide early warnings [16]. Another SWS case is in Singapore, where\
    \ a real-time monitoring\nsystem called WaterWiSe was built, utilizing wireless\
    \ sensor networks and data acquisition platforms\nto improve the operational eﬃciency\
    \ of the water supply system [17]. Moreover, in San Francisco, the\nautomated\
    \ real-time water meters are installed among those communities for more than 98%\
    \ of their\n178,000 customers to transmit hourly water consumption data to the\
    \ billing system via wireless sensing\nnetworks [18]. This access to frequently\
    \ updated water consumption information allows engineers\nto detect water quality\
    \ events and localize pipe leaks faster than traditional water systems that are\n\
    still using existing manually-read meters [19]. Given these ACT and ICT applications\
    \ in water sectors,\nsmart water concepts therefore emerge and inspire SWS to\
    \ be widely accepted by large amounts\nof stakeholders.\nThe terms “smart water\
    \ grid,” “smart water supply system,” “smart water system” or “smart\nwater network”\
    \ have been widely spread. The concept of SWS in the urban water ﬁeld is gaining\n\
    great impetus among academia, government, and industry, drawing attention from\
    \ international\ncommunities (SWAN, EWRI, HIC, and CCWI) to top-level organizations\
    \ (IWA, AWWA, AWC-Asian\nWater Council). Other international collaboration projects\
    \ (e.g., i-WIDGT from EU [20], CANARY\nfrom US [21], SEQ from the Australian water\
    \ resources department [22], and Smart City reports [23])\nare providing professional\
    \ support to smart urban water infrastructure all over the world [24–26].\nAlthough\
    \ researches on SWS are speeding up to meet the demand of industry and government,\
    \ the\nconceptual, technical and practical gaps between providers and clients\
    \ are still not well bridged.\nThe inﬂuences of SWS could be more signiﬁcant and\
    \ essential if priorities are precisely deﬁned and\nWater 2020, 12, 412\n3 of\
    \ 25\nimplemented into sensing technology domains in water contexts [27]. As a\
    \ consequence of the lack of\na systematic consensus from conceptual, technical,\
    \ and practical perspectives, investigating the current\narchitectures, initiatives,\
    \ and applications of SWS around the world must be required to help generate\n\
    a better understanding of the deﬁnitions, characteristics, and future trends of\
    \ SWS. While review\nstudies related to SWS and smart grid areas have already\
    \ been undertaken [28–31], a review of SWS in\nconceptual and comprehensive prospects,\
    \ with a further notiﬁcation on the deﬁnition, architecture,\nand metrics, is\
    \ missing. To address this research gap, this paper is going to analyze the existing\
    \ SWS\nconcepts, identify the possible metrics for SWS, and establish a more systematic\
    \ SWS architecture, to\nenlighten future research on its implementations.\nThis\
    \ review paper is structured as follows: ﬁrstly, the current deﬁnitions and historical\
    \ development\nof SWS are presented and discussed in the introduction section,\
    \ reviewing the evolution of SWS from\nthe past to the date and analyzing the\
    \ weakness of the current water system. Secondly, given the\nprevious literature\
    \ of SWS, a new architecture of SWS with ﬁve layers is put forward and demonstrated\n\
    explicitly. Then, by reconciling deﬁnitions and architectures, two metrics of\
    \ SWS are proposed to\ncharacterize its properties. Finally, recommendations on\
    \ future research directions are given for smart\nwater system development.\n\
    2. Literature Review of SWS\nSWS is a multidisciplinary term. A ScienceDirect\
    \ search for “Smart” or “Intelligent” in the title,\nabstract, and keyword gave\
    \ a total of 31,527 article results. However, most of them belong to smart\ntransportation,\
    \ smartphone, and smart grid ﬁelds. If “water” is included in the search, the\
    \ number\ngoes down to 9847. Further searching “Smart Water System” made the results\
    \ decline to 9517. By\nadding “framework” to the “Smart water system” only 4026\
    \ articles remained. Given that searching\nresults, we conducted the literature\
    \ review by considering relevant references from the selected papers.\nThe step-by-step\
    \ literature searching rules were summarized below: (1) “Smart” or “Intelligent”\
    \ in title,\nabstract, and keyword with 31,527 article results; (2) “Smart Water”\
    \ in title, abstract, and keyword with\n9517 article results; (3) “Framework”\
    \ and “Smart Water” in title, abstract, keyword, and body with\n4026 article results;\
    \ (4) “Structure”, “Layer”, “Framework” and “Smart Water” by manual ﬁltering with\n\
    32 article results. These 32 ﬁnal pieces of literature, including four article\
    \ forms such as forums, papers,\nreports, and presentations gain high popularity\
    \ in multiple sources like Google Scholar, SCOPUS, and\nScienceDirect. All the\
    \ papers come from the recent 10–15 years; they provide a wide presentation\n\
    of the smart water system for the readers, which include the typical arguments\
    \ of the framework\nof SWS. With insight from these literatures in Table 1, there\
    \ are 17 papers, 10 technical reports from\ndiﬀerent well-known organizations\
    \ including the International Telecommunication Union [32], U.S\nEnvironment Protection\
    \ Agency [33], UK Department for International Development [34], UN Global\nOpportunity\
    \ Committee [35–38], and Colorado State University [39]. Four key presentations\
    \ and one\nInternational forum [40,41] are also taken into consideration in this\
    \ review. As the number of studies\nthat we reviewed is limited, this paper does\
    \ not cover all aspects of SWS.\nWater 2020, 12, 412\n4 of 25\nTable 1. Classiﬁcation\

    The following is a list of works of literature related to the framework of the\
    \ smart water system in\nTable 1. We categorized these papers according to the\
    \ smart water deﬁnition, structures (Instrument\nlayer, Property layer, Function\
    \ layer, Beneﬁt layer, Application layer), and metrics, which correspond\nwith\
    \ the components of the proposed SWS framework below. The deﬁnition provides theoretical\n\
    support for SWS structures, and the metrics can be used to evaluate the SWS performance.\
    \ These ﬁve\nbasic layers inside structures consist of a comprehensive SWS architecture.\
    \ The relationship among\ndeﬁnitions, layers, and metrics make SWS work, which\
    \ is considered as the reason for the literature\nclassiﬁcation in this study.\
    \ In Table 1, “Instrument” represents the instrument layer of SWS including\n\
    the physical and ACT and ICT components. “Property” means the property layer of\
    \ SWS containing\nthe components like systems attributes. “Function” represents\
    \ the function layer of SWS such as data\nfusion in the data center. “Beneﬁt”\
    \ represents the beneﬁt layer including features like water quality\nsecurity\
    \ and energy saving. “Application” represents the application layer such as commercial\
    \ and\neducational applications. “Metrics” relate to the methods applied to evaluate\
    \ the smart water system.\n“Future research” stands for research direction recommendations\
    \ regarding the smart water system.\nEach reference might include but not all\
    \ components (deﬁnition, layers, and metrics) of the smart water\nsystem. A black\
    \ solid circle was used to mark the elements that references have covered. It\
    \ can be found\nthat most of the pieces of literature have deﬁnitions of SWS.\
    \ However, none of them have covered all\nkey layers. Since SWS is built for diﬀerent\
    \ purposes, the structure of SWS may vary from case to case.\nFurthermore, among\
    \ all those pieces of literature that we reviewed, only 7 of them discussed metrics\n\
    for SWS. How to assess the performance of SWS was not fully explored based on\
    \ currently available\nliterature. It was evident that there is still great potential\
    \ to improve the consensus and understanding\nof SWS. Table 1 also shows that\
    \ over 90% of the relevant literature has recommended future research\ndirections\
    \ for SWS. This paper will summarize these suggestions later in Section 5.\nWater\
    \ 2020, 12, 412\n9 of 25\n3. A Systematic Framework of SWS\nA systematic architecture\
    \ of SWS is comprised of various layers working synergistically to perform\nuseful\
    \ functions and applications [62]. Such a system can be represented as a set of\
    \ components, with\nspeciﬁc properties and beneﬁts. In past years, previous studies\
    \ proposed various versions of SWS to\nmeet their particular demands. The combinations\
    \ of SWS that are water management technologies and\nICT distinguished from traditional\
    \ water management technologies were put forward [54]. However,\nthe scopes and\
    \ characteristics of such SWS were not identiﬁed. Further, the term “SWG” refers\
    \ to an\nadvanced smart water grid that includes real-time information sharing\
    \ through smart measurement\nand networking and a sustainable water distribution\
    \ infrastructure [46]. The smart components in\nSWG imply that a smart water network\
    \ should comprise smart meters, smart valves, and smart\npumps by deﬁnition [28].\
    \ These smart elements including physical electronic parts, like sensors and\n\
    microcontrollers, communication protocols, and embedded systems are all folded\
    \ in the concept of the\nInternet of Things (IoT), which is the foundation of\
    \ SWS [46]. The structure of SWS, therefore, should\ncontain three frameworks:\
    \ the hierarchy framework, technical system, and function framework [61].\nIn\
    \ the hierarchy framework and technical system, there are also numerous pieces\
    \ required. An\neasy-to-understand architecture of SWS would be preferred. The\
    \ principals of the smart water network\nwere then explained [44]. This research\
    \ can be segmented in various layers: (1) physical layer (like\npipes); (2) sensing\
    \ and control layer (like ﬂow) sensors and remote control; (3) data collection\
    \ and\ncommunication layer (like data transfer); (4) data management and display;\
    \ (5) data fusion and analysis\n(like analysis tool and even detection, leakage\
    \ detection, and decision making). Nonetheless, these\nlayers still only contain\
    \ physical and cyber components and a lack of improvement to the service\nlevel.\
    \ It was proposed that SWS contains 5 layers: physical layer, sensing layer, and\
    \ control layer,\ncollection and communication layer, data management and display\
    \ layer, and data fusion and analysis\nlayer [53]. They also put forward a bottom-up\
    \ framework of SWS with 5 layers: sensing layer, transport\nlayer, processing\
    \ layer, application layer, and uniﬁed portal layer, which are based on IoT and\
    \ cloud\ncomputing [53]. Another SWS composed of 4 stages was established to secure\
    \ the vast amounts of\nhigh-resolution assumption data and customized information\
    \ [20].\nThe most widely accepted smart water architecture is characterized by\
    \ ﬁve layers: the physical\nlayer, sensing, and control layer, collection and\
    \ communication layer, data management and display\nlayer, and data fusion and\
    \ analysis layer. Each segment covers a distinct function in the network [62].\n\
    However, all SWS introduced above are under debate since most of them are deﬁned\
    \ for one particular\npurpose without complete demonstration. Some of them are\
    \ for smart water targets, some stress\nthe innovation of mechanism, while others\
    \ emphasize the application of ICT. Very few of in situ\nframeworks for understanding\
    \ SWS are comprehensive and directly applicable for education, research,\nand\
    \ public. They lack some critical elements like properties, metrics and case studies,\
    \ and the ability to\nguide future research directions. Hence, it is necessary\
    \ to build a systematic framework of SWS to\nfurther the understanding of SWS\
    \ and accelerate the implementation of SWS. In this study, we adopt\nand integrate\
    \ some of the existing architectures to propose systematic architecture. Figure\
    \ 5 illustrates\nthe authors’ conceptual representation of an orderly architecture\
    \ of SWS within a systematic smart\nwater framework. There are ﬁve layers (from\
    \ bottom to top: instruments layer, function layer, property\nlayer, beneﬁts layer,\
    \ and application layer) that are proposed in order to understand how systematic\n\
    architecture is implemented in the SWS framework. Although such a conceptual framework\
    \ has not\nbeen tested in the ﬁeld, this provides the guidance for engineers to\
    \ replicate the SWS according to their\npurposes and application. For instance,\
    \ a smart water test-bed for educational purposes can be built\non the lab by\
    \ following the SWS framework, while the application layer might be unnecessary\
    \ in this\ncase [63].\nWater 2020, 12, 412\n10 of 25\nWater 2020, 12, 412 \n9\
    \ of 24 \n \n \nFigure 5. A New Framework of Smart Water System. \n3.1. Instruments\
    \ Layer \nTypically, the instruments layer of SWS should be composed of physical\
    \ infrastructure \n(network-level components) and cyberinfrastructure (internet-related\
    \ hardware, software, and \nservices). Although the physical instruments are the\
    \ basic structure of the water system, they cannot \nmake it smart or even data-enables\
    \ only by itself. The cyberinfrastructure includes multiple \nintelligent devices\
    \ like smart sensors, smart pumps, and smart valves, etc. Their primary roles\
    \ and \napplication goals are summarized in Table 2. The smart components of cyberinfrastructure\
    \ are the \nelements in which SWS differs from the traditional water distribution\
    \ system. For example, \ntraditional water distribution systems with only physical\
    \ instruments carry on pressure or flow data. \nConversely, the SWS with cyber\
    \ instruments not only sends a flow or pressure signal, but their data \nsteam\
    \ including diagnostic information also makes the SWS detect leaks more efficiently\
    \ and \nautomatically. Additionally, for the integrated SWS, the interaction and\
    \ relationship between \nphysical and cyberinfrastructure should not be ignored.\
    \ Showing in Figure 5 below, physical \ninstruments, including pipes, valves,\
    \ and pumps provide the structural basement for the placement \nand installation\
    \ of cyber instruments like smart meter and intelligent sensors (e.g., electromagnetic\
    \ \nor ultrasonic). Meanwhile, physical infrastructures are elements that produce\
    \ the required data and \ninformation, which would be collected, transferred,\
    \ processed, and fused by internet-related \nhardware, software, and services.\
    \ In return, the cyber instruments can instruct the operation and \nmaintenance\
    \ of physical components by analyzing the newly produced data and forecasting\
    \ the \nsystem condition. For example, the automated meters are bi-direction communication\
    \ devices that \ncan execute actions on devices (e.g., valve turn off and on)\
    \ [23]. Furthermore, the different smart \nsensors might be designed to solve\
    \ various problems (shown in Figure 6) by operating systems \ndiscriminatively.\
    \ Therefore, the components layer of SWS should achieve both of the roles of physical\
    \ \ninfrastructure and cyber-infrastructure. \nFigure 5. A New Framework of Smart\
    \ Water System.\n3.1. Instruments Layer\nTypically, the instruments layer of SWS\
    \ should be composed of physical infrastructure\n(network-level components) and\
    \ cyberinfrastructure (internet-related hardware, software, and services).\nAlthough\
    \ the physical instruments are the basic structure of the water system, they cannot\
    \ make it\nsmart or even data-enables only by itself. The cyberinfrastructure\
    \ includes multiple intelligent devices\nlike smart sensors, smart pumps, and\
    \ smart valves, etc. Their primary roles and application goals\nare summarized\
    \ in Table 2. The smart components of cyberinfrastructure are the elements in\
    \ which\nSWS diﬀers from the traditional water distribution system. For example,\
    \ traditional water distribution\nsystems with only physical instruments carry\
    \ on pressure or ﬂow data. Conversely, the SWS with\ncyber instruments not only\
    \ sends a ﬂow or pressure signal, but their data steam including diagnostic\n\
    information also makes the SWS detect leaks more eﬃciently and automatically.\
    \ Additionally, for the\nintegrated SWS, the interaction and relationship between\
    \ physical and cyberinfrastructure should not\nbe ignored. Showing in Figure 5\
    \ below, physical instruments, including pipes, valves, and pumps\nprovide the\

    \ For example, the automated meters are\nbi-direction communication devices that\
    \ can execute actions on devices (e.g., valve turn oﬀ and on) [23].\nFurthermore,\
    \ the diﬀerent smart sensors might be designed to solve various problems (shown\
    \ in\nFigure 6) by operating systems discriminatively. Therefore, the components\
    \ layer of SWS should\nachieve both of the roles of physical infrastructure and\

    \ the SWS assessment,\nsuch as smartness, how eﬃcient the SWS is towards real-time,\
    \ and cyber wellness, how defensible\nthe SWS is against cyberattack, would be\
    \ discussed in the next section. In this work, we proposed\nthat SWS based on\
    \ components layer should have 4 properties: (1) Automation; (2) Resourcefulness;\n\
    (3) Real-time; (4) Connectivity. We designed the interaction between each other\
    \ within the property\nloop in Figure 7. For instance, automation is the foundation\
    \ to achieve real-time and also real-time is\nfacilitated by connectivity. Resourcefulness\
    \ is ensured by the automation and connectivity among\nvarious IoT. One common\
    \ sense is that these four properties might not be applied to each case of SWS,\n\
    and also, some researchers may consider SWS with other extra features, but these\
    \ four demonstrate\nwhat most SWS look like.\nWater 2020, 12, 412\n12 of 25\n\
    Water 2020, 12, 412 \n11 of 24 \n \n \nFigure 7. Property layer designing. \n\
    Automation is the fundamental property, which means that SWS can perform the physical\
    \ and \ncyber components’ operation automatically once the relevant parameters\
    \ are set manually. This is a \nnear-automatic process in the SWS since the application\
    \ of ACT and ICT enables the SWS to execute \none-way or two-way orders without\
    \ too many operators’ involvement. For the one-way control case \n(e.g., by setting\
    \ the sampling interval in the Arduino sketch), the smart sensor can modify the\
    \ data \ncollecting frequency. As to the two-way control example, the real-time\
    \ metering data fusion can help \nprovide feedback for the control center, where\
    \ the data analytic tools, in turn, give instructions to the \nopening status\
    \ of smart meters, smart valves, or intelligent pumps. Further, automation can\
    \ be \nimplemented not only for components providing functionality but also for\
    \ operation mechanisms. \nFor example, when water problems happen in the operation\
    \ process or the element itself, the smart \ncomponents notify the system center\
    \ and then take action to avoid a crash. Additionally, with \nautomatic self-verification,\
    \ the water utility can know when the sensor needs maintenance or re-\ninstallation\
    \ [64].  \nConnectivity is also a fundamental property, which means the degree\
    \ of interconnectedness or \nduplication [56]. In a cyber-physical system like\
    \ SWS, connectivity can be implemented by deploying \nmultiple sensors and software\
    \ for monitoring the same physical processes [65]. SWS should be \nqualified to\
    \ connect with different software and hardware to make the system collect data,\
    \ analyze \ndata, and share information publicly. For example, the SWS can be\
    \ connected with the hydraulic \nmodel, GIS platform, billing system, and Database\
    \ Model.  \nReal-time is the core property of SWS, which can also be called system\
    \ efficiency. The real-time \nperformance of SWS is characterized as online steps\
    \ like online data monitoring, online data \nassimilation, online modeling, online\
    \ plotting, and online results output, despite offline performance \nincluded\
    \ in SWS. Real-time is the property that SWS obtains to achieve the required smart\
    \ features \n[66]. However, current research mainly focuses on real-time modeling.\
    \ The real-time modeling of \nSWS is structured as 6 steps: (1) Communicate SCADA\
    \ datasets; (2) Updating the network model \nboundary conditions and operational\
    \ statuses; (3) Pausing execution; (4) Generating the \ncorresponding networks\
    \ analysis; (5) Waiting for the new SCADA measurements to reload the \nnetwork\
    \ model; (6) Return the network simulation. Mentioned in the connectivity property,\
    \ real-time \nmodeling can be performed only by connecting with data sources systems\
    \ like SCADA with \nmodeling tools like EPANET-RTX [60]. This newly produced data\
    \ from real-time hydraulic modeling \ncan forecast results and calibrate the model\
    \ by comparing measurements and predicted values. \nFigure 7. Property layer designing.\n\
    Automation is the fundamental property, which means that SWS can perform the physical\
    \ and\ncyber components’ operation automatically once the relevant parameters\

    \ the data analytic tools, in turn, give instructions to\nthe opening status of\
    \ smart meters, smart valves, or intelligent pumps. Further, automation can be\n\
    implemented not only for components providing functionality but also for operation\
    \ mechanisms.\nFor example, when water problems happen in the operation process\
    \ or the element itself, the smart\ncomponents notify the system center and then\
    \ take action to avoid a crash. Additionally, with automatic\nself-veriﬁcation,\
    \ the water utility can know when the sensor needs maintenance or re-installation\
    \ [64].\nConnectivity is also a fundamental property, which means the degree of\
    \ interconnectedness or\nduplication [56]. In a cyber-physical system like SWS,\
    \ connectivity can be implemented by deploying\nmultiple sensors and software\
    \ for monitoring the same physical processes [65]. SWS should be qualiﬁed\nto\
    \ connect with diﬀerent software and hardware to make the system collect data,\
    \ analyze data, and\nshare information publicly. For example, the SWS can be connected\
    \ with the hydraulic model, GIS\nplatform, billing system, and Database Model.\n\
    Real-time is the core property of SWS, which can also be called system eﬃciency.\
    \ The real-time\nperformance of SWS is characterized as online steps like online\
    \ data monitoring, online data assimilation,\nonline modeling, online plotting,\
    \ and online results output, despite oﬄine performance included in\nSWS. Real-time\
    \ is the property that SWS obtains to achieve the required smart features [66].\
    \ However,\ncurrent research mainly focuses on real-time modeling. The real-time\
    \ modeling of SWS is structured as\n6 steps: (1) Communicate SCADA datasets; (2)\
    \ Updating the network model boundary conditions\nand operational statuses; (3)\
    \ Pausing execution; (4) Generating the corresponding networks analysis;\n(5)\
    \ Waiting for the new SCADA measurements to reload the network model; (6) Return\
    \ the network\nsimulation. Mentioned in the connectivity property, real-time modeling\
    \ can be performed only by\nconnecting with data sources systems like SCADA with\
    \ modeling tools like EPANET-RTX [60]. This\nnewly produced data from real-time\
    \ hydraulic modeling can forecast results and calibrate the model\nby comparing\
    \ measurements and predicted values.\nResourcefulness is the ﬁnal property, which\
    \ means the SWS not only owns massive data storage\nbut also aims to timely exchange\
    \ data for further analysis. This property of data exchange can also be\nWater\
    \ 2020, 12, 412\n13 of 25\ninterpreted as interoperability, which refers to the\
    \ capability of units of an SWS to exchange and use\ninformation and services\
    \ with one another and interfaced external units [67]. SWS provides massive\n\
    information to an automation and security system, compared with the traditional\
    \ instruments [58].\nTypically, there are three types of source data open to the\
    \ processor: spatial data, attribute data,\nand multimedia data, which determine\
    \ the database model designing. However, these data can\nonly be shared with the\
    \ public and business after being analyzed by experts. Those processed data\n\
    would be input into the hydraulic model to produce forecasting data, and those\
    \ visualized data\nwould be interpreted as valuable information such as early\
    \ warning system, assessment of pipe\nleakage/breaks, or identiﬁcation of cyberattacks\
    \ or for decision support [68]. Moreover, the processed\ninformation or data would\
    \ be transmitted back to the SCADA system and stored as instrument status\nand\
    \ diagnostic information.\n3.3. Function Layer\nFunctions of SWS can be determined\
    \ by the instrument layer and property layer since diﬀerent\ncomponents and properties\
    \ lead to diﬀerent functions. For example, one SWS installed with ﬂow and\npressure\
    \ sensor would consider being featured with resourcefulness and can verify the\
    \ pressure-driven\nmodeling analysis with enormous data collection resources [69].\
    \ In contrast, SWS is equipped with\ntemperature sensors functions predicting\
    \ the inﬁltration rate in the water systems with available\ntemperature data [70].\
    \ Within the architecture of SWS, the function layer is localized in the connection\n\
    point between system’s property and metrics and plays a role in linking these\
    \ two (shown in the\nframework Figure 5). Thus, the function layer can be interpreted\
    \ as the backbone of SWS that\nincludes functionalities of intelligent sensing,\
    \ simulation, diagnosis, warning, dispatching, disposal,\nand control [43]. However,\
    \ this study does not demonstrate the status of a function layer on the whole\n\
    framework. Based on this function layer, this paper re-designs and speciﬁes the\
    \ function layer shown\nin Figure 8, which includes data producing, data sensing,\
    \ data processing, simulation operating, and\napplication supporting.\nWater 2020,\
    \ 12, 412 \n12 of 24 \n \nResourcefulness is the final property, which means the\
    \ SWS not only owns massive data storage \nbut also aims to timely exchange data\
    \ for further analysis. This property of data exchange can also be \ninterpreted\
    \ as interoperability, which refers to the capability of units of an SWS to exchange\
    \ and use \ninformation and services with one another and interfaced external\
    \ units [67]. SWS provides massive \ninformation to an automation and security\
    \ system, compared with the traditional instruments [58]. \nTypically, there are\
    \ three types of source data open to the processor: spatial data, attribute data,\
    \ and \nmultimedia data, which determine the database model designing. However,\
    \ these data can only be \nshared with the public and business after being analyzed\
    \ by experts. Those processed data would be \ninput into the hydraulic model to\
    \ produce forecasting data, and those visualized data would be \ninterpreted as\
    \ valuable information such as early warning system, assessment of pipe leakage/breaks,\
    \ \nor identification of cyberattacks or for decision support [68]. Moreover,\
    \ the processed information or \ndata would be transmitted back to the SCADA system\
    \ and stored as instrument status and diagnostic \ninformation. \n3.3. Function\
    \ Layer  \nFunctions of SWS can be determined by the instrument layer and property\
    \ layer since different \ncomponents and properties lead to different functions.\
    \ For example, one SWS installed with flow and \npressure sensor would consider\
    \ being featured with resourcefulness and can verify the pressure-\ndriven modeling\
    \ analysis with enormous data collection resources [69]. In contrast, SWS is equipped\
    \ \nwith temperature sensors functions predicting the infiltration rate in the\
    \ water systems with available \ntemperature data [70]. Within the architecture\
    \ of SWS, the function layer is localized in the connection \npoint between system’s\
    \ property and metrics and plays a role in linking these two (shown in the \n\
    framework Figure 5). Thus, the function layer can be interpreted as the backbone\
    \ of SWS that includes \nfunctionalities of intelligent sensing, simulation, diagnosis,\
    \ warning, dispatching, disposal, and \ncontrol [43]. However, this study does\
    \ not demonstrate the status of a function layer on the whole \nframework. Based\
    \ on this function layer, this paper re-designs and specifies the function layer\
    \ shown \nin Figure 8, which includes data producing, data sensing, data processing,\
    \ simulation operating, and \napplication supporting. \n \nFigure 8. Function\

    \ system with smart devices brings many benefits such \nas bill reduction for\
    \ consumers, operation cost decreases for utility, and water loss declines [10].\
    \ In \nthis study, the benefit layer mainly contains four aspects including prolonging\
    \ the asset life cycle, \nincreasing energy sustainability, optimizing pressure\
    \ and water quality, obtaining real-time water \nconsumption shown in Figure 9\

    \ Prolong Asset Life Cycle and Cost Saving. \nAs real-time property states, an\
    \ SWS can integrate and analyze real-time monitoring data from \nvarious instruments\
    \ for decision-making support. Especially, monitoring data regarding pipelines,\
    \ \nvalves, pumps, and tank conditions can be used to develop a risk-evaluated\
    \ model for instrument \nreplacement or maintenance. This allows SWS to plan and\
    \ schedule the replacement and \nrehabilitation of the asset program efficiently\
    \ as well as effectively so that the right assets can be \nreplaced, repaired,\
    \ and rebuilt in a timely manner. Thus, the real-time monitoring of asset status\
    \ \ncould be regarded as indicators of preventive maintenance and predictive replacement\
    \ to prolong \nthe assets’ life cycle and cost savings [74–76]. \n3.4.2. Reduce\
    \ Energy Loss and Improve System Efficiency \nEnergy is needed to extract, deliver,\
    \ treat, and heat water for municipal, industrial, and \nagricultural uses [77,78].\
    \ In the United States, the energy required to move and handle the water is \n\
    estimated to comprise 4% of total electricity consumption nationwide [79]. Knowing\
    \ the quantity of \nwater needed, and accounting for any losses, utilities can\
    \ produce less water. This will be reflected \nin lower energy consumption as\
    \ well as in water conservation. The energy loss and costs can be \nreduced by\
    \ reducing the amount of water needed to be pumped, transported, heated, or treated\
    \ [80]. \nLeakage in the water distribution system leads to additional energy\
    \ required to pump and carry \nwater to consumers as a result. Smart water sensors\
    \ can monitor online pressure and warn pressure \nchanges or significant pressure\
    \ losses along with the water network, where utilities can remotely \noptimize\
    \ the network pressure to help save energy [57]. \n3.4.3. Optimize Pressure Supply\
    \ and Water Quality \nReal-time data allows SWS to enhance system planning and\
    \ operations by monitoring the \nhydraulic and water quality situation throughout\
    \ the system [81]. On the one hand, the deficit \npressure in the water distribution\
    \ system can be detected so that actions can be taken promptly to \nalleviate\
    \ the risk of pipe bursts. On the other hand, automated valve or smart gate operations\
    \ can \nadjust the operating status to prevent pipe burst and water leakage, which\
    \ might compensate for \ninstruments changing process conditions or water treatment\
    \ plant requirements [47]. Those data \nfrom SCADA and hydraulic integration can\
    \ also be used for foreseeing the negative operating \nconsequences, predicting\
    \ future boundary conditions, and knowing the current system status in real-\n\
    time, which empowers operators and engineers to control the water systems more\
    \ effectively. \nFigure 9. Beneﬁts layer designing.\n3.4.1. Prolong Asset Life\
    \ Cycle and Cost Saving\nAs real-time property states, an SWS can integrate and\
    \ analyze real-time monitoring data from\nvarious instruments for decision-making\
    \ support. Especially, monitoring data regarding pipelines,\nvalves, pumps, and\
    \ tank conditions can be used to develop a risk-evaluated model for instrument\n\
    replacement or maintenance. This allows SWS to plan and schedule the replacement\
    \ and rehabilitation\nof the asset program eﬃciently as well as eﬀectively so\
    \ that the right assets can be replaced, repaired,\nand rebuilt in a timely manner.\
    \ Thus, the real-time monitoring of asset status could be regarded as\nindicators\
    \ of preventive maintenance and predictive replacement to prolong the assets’\
    \ life cycle and\ncost savings [74–76].\n3.4.2. Reduce Energy Loss and Improve\
    \ System Eﬃciency\nEnergy is needed to extract, deliver, treat, and heat water\
    \ for municipal, industrial, and agricultural\nuses [77,78]. In the United States,\
    \ the energy required to move and handle the water is estimated to\ncomprise 4%\
    \ of total electricity consumption nationwide [79]. Knowing the quantity of water\
    \ needed,\nand accounting for any losses, utilities can produce less water. This\
    \ will be reﬂected in lower energy\nconsumption as well as in water conservation.\
    \ The energy loss and costs can be reduced by reducing\nthe amount of water needed\
    \ to be pumped, transported, heated, or treated [80]. Leakage in the water\ndistribution\
    \ system leads to additional energy required to pump and carry water to consumers\
    \ as a\nresult. Smart water sensors can monitor online pressure and warn pressure\
    \ changes or signiﬁcant\npressure losses along with the water network, where utilities\
    \ can remotely optimize the network\npressure to help save energy [57].\n3.4.3.\
    \ Optimize Pressure Supply and Water Quality\nReal-time data allows SWS to enhance\
    \ system planning and operations by monitoring the\nhydraulic and water quality\
    \ situation throughout the system [81]. On the one hand, the deﬁcit pressure\n\
    in the water distribution system can be detected so that actions can be taken\
    \ promptly to alleviate\nthe risk of pipe bursts. On the other hand, automated\
    \ valve or smart gate operations can adjust the\noperating status to prevent pipe\
    \ burst and water leakage, which might compensate for instruments\nchanging process\
    \ conditions or water treatment plant requirements [47]. Those data from SCADA\
    \ and\nhydraulic integration can also be used for foreseeing the negative operating\
    \ consequences, predicting\nfuture boundary conditions, and knowing the current\
    \ system status in real-time, which empowers\noperators and engineers to control\
    \ the water systems more eﬀectively.\nThe implementation of cyber instruments\
    \ into the water system can be utilized for warning\npollutants intrusion.\nContinuous\
    \ online monitoring for water quality indicators, such as free\nWater 2020, 12,\
    \ 412\n15 of 25\nchlorine, total organic carbon, pH, conductivity, and turbidity,\
    \ assist the eﬀective response to a\nwater contamination incident and to mitigate\
    \ further consequences. For example, the real-time\nwater quality issue detection\
    \ system called CANARY can use advanced monitoring technologies and\nenhanced\
    \ surveillance instruments to collect, integrate, analyze, and communicate information\
    \ that\nprovides a timely warning of potential contamination events [82].\n3.4.4.\
    \ Obtain Real-Time Water Consumption and Consumer Billing\nSWS connected with\
    \ the billing system and consumption system can display the metering\ninformation\
    \ on the end-user’s platform, like laptops, smartphones, or tablets via internet\
    \ connection.\nThis real-time water consumption information helps customers to\
    \ save water and costs [83,84]. As\nthe crux elements of SWS, the automated meter\
    \ readings (AMR) and automatic meter infrastructure\n(AMI) provide real-time feedback\
    \ on water usage for customers. This enables customers to make\ninformed choices\
    \ towards water-consuming habits and join in the water management activity. In\n\
    reverse, the change of demand pattern would help the engineers and operators to\
    \ calibrate their model,\noptimize pump and valves schedules [85], and modify\
    \ the boundary conditions timely as eﬃciently as\naccurately [47].\n3.5. Application\
    \ Layer\nIn the application layer, there are three aspects generally classiﬁed\
    \ as the Public application,\nGovernment application, and Business application\
    \ shown in Figure 10. The application layer is\nmainly user-oriented for decision-making\
    \ support ﬁnally. These three kinds of applications can receive\nfeedback from\
    \ the corresponding users like consumers, utilities and markets, or other terminals\
    \ shown\nin Figure 10 below.\nWater 2020, 12, 412 \n15 of 24 \n  \nFigure 10.\
    \ Application layer designing. \n4. Metrics for SWS \nThe technical structure\
    \ of SWS has a pyramid structure with core information on the top to \nensure\
    \ system efficiency and security [87]. Figure 11 illustrates the features of such\
    \ a technical \nstructure. In this general structure of SWS, the configuration\
    \ of components and connections can be \ninterpreted as a network of cyber information\
    \ (e.g., leak detection, discharge control, and noise \nrecognition), data compiling\
    \ (e.g., real-time modeling, real-time controlling, and real-time sampling), \n\
    and physical instruments (e.g., sensors and loggers) domain. In Figure 11, nodes\
    \ represent system \ncomponents while the links stand for the functional relationship\
    \ between nodes. For instance, the \nbottom nodes are connected with the intermedia\
    \ nodes, which optionally means that the data from \nthe sensor is transmitted\
    \ to SCADA via links. To better assess the SWS’s efficiency and security within\
    \ \nthese domains, it is necessary to develop the metrics [45].\nFigure 10. Application\
    \ layer designing.\nThe public application aims to share real-time data and information\
    \ with consumers for their\nfeedback on billing and consumption, which is beneﬁcial\
    \ for water conservation and costs saving.\nBesides, public awareness about this\
    \ SWS and water conservation should be stressed. More community\ninvolvement might\
    \ be eliminated by providing citizens with more information regarding water\n\
    conservation and SWS. Manual ﬂow meters reading and installation may cause problems\
    \ like the\nembarrassing access of individuals and invasion of government on private\
    \ property [86]. SWS’s\ntechnology development, combined with public awareness\
    \ improvement, can reduce those risks.\nWater 2020, 12, 412\n16 of 25\nThe government\
    \ application targets water utilities, diﬀerent users from public applications.\
    \ As\nthe construction work of the water system, such as pipe replacement, instruments\
    \ installation, and\ndata center establishment, is the responsibility of the water\
    \ utility, the sensors deployed by the water\nutility are helpful to take an insight\
    \ of what is happening in SWS, and the collected sensor data would\nbe adopted\
    \ to support government decision.\nThe last application is the business application.\
    \ The current smart water market mainly focuses\non developing sensors and real-time\
    \ software. But there are only a few standards or guidelines to\nevaluate these\
    \ intelligent products. The application and development of SWS can accelerate\
    \ the\nspeed of evaluating the system on market feedback and build the rules of\
    \ the smart water market.\nAdditionally, the application layer is dependent on\
    \ the purpose of data acquisition. However, there is\nno single protocol that\
    \ can adequately suit all the applications and communication processes, and an\n\
    overall application protocol would be too complex to support eﬃcient business\
    \ processes. Therefore,\nanother business application is the on-going multi-protocol\
    \ handing devices for speciﬁc purposes since\none proprietary single-manufacturer\
    \ protocol would not be the best for interoperability in SWS. These\ndevices can\
    \ stimulate communications by using the existing or coming protocols and also\
    \ allow open\nprogrammable interfaces that can be customized for market tests\
    \ and feedback [55].\n4. Metrics for SWS\nThe technical structure of SWS has a\
    \ pyramid structure with core information on the top to ensure\nsystem eﬃciency\
    \ and security [87]. Figure 11 illustrates the features of such a technical structure.\
    \ In\nthis general structure of SWS, the conﬁguration of components and connections\
    \ can be interpreted\nas a network of cyber information (e.g., leak detection,\
    \ discharge control, and noise recognition),\ndata compiling (e.g., real-time\
    \ modeling, real-time controlling, and real-time sampling), and physical\ninstruments\
    \ (e.g., sensors and loggers) domain. In Figure 11, nodes represent system components\n\
    while the links stand for the functional relationship between nodes. For instance,\
    \ the bottom nodes\nare connected with the intermedia nodes, which optionally\
    \ means that the data from the sensor is\ntransmitted to SCADA via links. To better\
    \ assess the SWS’s eﬃciency and security within these\ndomains, it is necessary\
    \ to develop the metrics [45].\n \n  \nFigure 10. Application layer designing.\

    \ a smart water system technical structure. \nFigure 11. Illustration of a smart\
    \ water system technical structure.\nBefore moving to the metrics discussion,\
    \ the relationship between property and metrics should\nbe clariﬁed. While metrics\
    \ are reﬁned from properties, and both metrics and properties might be\nconnected\
    \ by functions, the application of SWS ultimately aims to assess the performance\
    \ of SWS.\nTherefore, properties can be seen as the inherent components of SWS\
    \ whilst metrics are the manual\nWater 2020, 12, 412\n17 of 25\nproduct. Additionally,\
    \ properties might determine the assessment indexes on a given SWS, while\nmetrics\
    \ are those elements to achieve the terminal performance. For example, real-time\
    \ modeling is a\ncrucial property of SWS, which makes measuring the eﬃciency of\
    \ SWS one indicator for smartness.\nFurthermore, the performance of data processing\
    \ in the context of resourcefulness is related to\ninformational security. However,\
    \ the eﬀects of property layers on metrics are not certain without\nspeciﬁc analysis\
    \ of a given system. In this section, the paper proposes two new conceptual metrics\n\
    (Smartness and Cyber wellness) for assessing two essential properties of SWS,\
    \ eﬃciency and security,\nand discusses how to deﬁne these two metrics and how\
    \ they can be objectively built to deal with\nthreats of SWS.\nA brief investigation\
    \ of 27 reviewed academic studies was conducted to analyze the SWS metrics\nshown\
    \ in Figure 12, showing the number of studies (report and paper) for smartness\
    \ scope and cyber\nwellness scope. Smartness and cyber wellness are seldom discussed\
    \ directly in previous articles and\nreports. Most of them mention relationships\
    \ with metrics or present the features of these two metrics.\nThus, we consider\
    \ that these papers and reports listed should be included in the scope of the\
    \ metric.\nIn the cyber wellness scope, cyber wellness only comes from the electrical\
    \ and telecommunication\nﬁelds [30], which makes it necessary to translate the\
    \ cyber wellness into water systems. Although\nsmartness has been described in\
    \ the previous environmental studies, the vision is a little broader as\nwater\
    \ systems are only a small part of the environment [87]. More eﬀorts would be\
    \ required to narrow\ndown the scope of smartness if it is applied in the water\
    \ system sector.\n \nBefore moving to the metrics discussion, the relationship\
    \ between property and metrics should \nbe clarified. While metrics are refined\
    \ from properties, and both metrics and properties might be \nconnected by functions,\
    \ the application of SWS ultimately aims to assess the performance of SWS. \n\
    Therefore, properties can be seen as the inherent components of SWS whilst metrics\
    \ are the manual \nproduct. Additionally, properties might determine the assessment\
    \ indexes on a given SWS, while \nmetrics are those elements to achieve the terminal\
    \ performance. For example, real-time modeling is \na crucial property of SWS,\
    \ which makes measuring the efficiency of SWS one indicator for smartness. \n\
    Furthermore, the performance of data processing in the context of resourcefulness\
    \ is related to \ninformational security. However, the effects of property layers\
    \ on metrics are not certain without \nspecific analysis of a given system. In\

    \ systems are only a small part of the environment [87]. More efforts would be\
    \ required to \nnarrow down the scope of smartness if it is applied in the water\
    \ system sector. \n \nFigure 12. The number of studies for different metrics scope.\
    \ \n4.1. Smartness \nIn previous studies, researchers made many efforts in achieving\
    \ smart performance in water \nsystems. The smart performance of SWS ought to\
    \ expand to real-time modeling, real-time sampling, \nand real-time controlling,\
    \ etc., which aim to minimize the time delay between system input and \nsystem\
    \ output. It was revealed that the efficiency of data transmission would be promoted\
    \ \nsignificantly by using SCADA [88,89]. Nevertheless, SCADA system enables multiple\
    \ connections \nwith various database and real-time modeling tools; the connection\
    \ between the SCADA and offline \nor time-delay modeling tools still makes the\
    \ water system not so smart as to reduce the data \nacquisition time. Some offline\
    \ modeling tools like Hydraulic CAD and WATSYS can only process \nhistorical data,\
    \ even though they are commonly used for the hydraulic model. Even if the SCADA\
    \ \nsystem and so-called real-time simulation tools have been integrated into\
    \ the water distribution \nsystem, it is still necessary to further understand\
    \ what makes the water system smart. Real-time \nmodeling tool applications like\
    \ EPANET-RTX [90], LVVWD [91], and EPANET-CPS [92] actually \nneed two steps to\
    \ finish work: pausing execution and waiting for the new SCADA measurements to\

    \ It was revealed that the eﬃciency of data transmission would be promoted signiﬁcantly\n\
    by using SCADA [88,89]. Nevertheless, SCADA system enables multiple connections\
    \ with various\ndatabase and real-time modeling tools; the connection between\
    \ the SCADA and oﬄine or time-delay\nmodeling tools still makes the water system\
    \ not so smart as to reduce the data acquisition time.\nSome oﬄine modeling tools\
    \ like Hydraulic CAD and WATSYS can only process historical data, even\nthough\
    \ they are commonly used for the hydraulic model. Even if the SCADA system and\
    \ so-called\nreal-time simulation tools have been integrated into the water distribution\

    \ and waiting for the new SCADA measurements to reload and to update the boundary\n\
    condition [93]. The Pausing and Waiting takes typically 10 seconds and 14 minutes,\
    \ respectively, which\nmakes smart modeling is close to being near real-time process\
    \ [94].\nWater 2020, 12, 412\n18 of 25\nThus, the time interval between system\
    \ input and output, which is characterized as a time lag\nequation, can be used\
    \ to assess how much smart it is. Overall, to deﬁne the SWS is to establish\n\
    the mechanism for reducing time lag among those processes like real-time monitoring,\
    \ real-time\ntransporting, real-time processing, real-time sampling, and real-time\
    \ simulation in SWS. In this study,\nthe term “Smartness” is introduced to quantify\
    \ the time lag reduction. The optimal levels of smartness\nrequire trade-oﬀs from\
    \ the source to the end [87]. This way, the smartness used in Equation (1)\naims\
    \ to minimize the system time costs from start input and terminal output. As smartness\
    \ ensures\nperformance, eﬃciency, and expediency, the maximum of smartness will\
    \ revolutionize the interaction\nrelationship between systems and engineers.\n\
    Smartness = min (Time lag: system input, system output)\n(1)\nThe unit for smartness\
    \ is minutes; a smartness below 15 min can be acceptable while a smartness\nover\
    \ 15 min is unfavorable. Smartness can be used to assess the eﬃciency of the smart\
    \ water system\nwhen dealing and interpreting measurements from real-world systems.\n\
    4.2. Cyber Wellness\nThe scale IoT devices are growing even faster than the world’s\
    \ population. There will be 20.4\nbillion connected devices by 2020, compared\
    \ with 7.8 billion global population [95]. These numbers\nhighlight IoT’s signiﬁcance\
    \ in the fourth industrial revolution, also known as the digital economy,\nwhere\
    \ IoT is expected to deliver the “smarts” needed to address common everyday challenges\
    \ in areas\nsuch as education, healthcare, utilities, transportation, and public\
    \ and residential buildings [96].\nSWS has a number of logical sub-layers in the\
    \ integration of physical components and IoT, where\nsensors and actuators are\
    \ deployed across the water distribution network to enable signiﬁcant data\nprocesses\
    \ and real-time performance. However, the pursuit of smartness without considering\
    \ data\nauthenticity and reliability would lead to information security issues.\
    \ Many information safety issues\nare from system integration [42]. Thus, security\
    \ at both IoT and network-level is critical to the operation\nof SWS [61]. Compared\
    \ with physical network level components, these data-related smart sensors\nand\
    \ intelligent devices with larger importance are the heart of SWS, occupying the\
    \ decision-making\nresources. In comparison with the physical network level, the\
    \ related data are easier to be chosen as the\nhitting points and even more vulnerable\
    \ to cyberattacks because the hackers or cyberattackers might\ntend to crush the\
    \ critical components of SWS or to steal the most crucial data saved in the database.\n\
    In this paper, we propose cyber wellness as one of the metrics to evaluate the\
    \ information security\nof SWS. Cyber wellness is ﬁrst put forward in the International\
    \ Telecommunication Union (ITU) to\ndescribe the health level of information and\
    \ communication technologies [97]. Continuously, cyber\nwellness is also introduced\
    \ into the education ﬁeld to describe the health level of Internet users [88].\
    \ In\nterms of information security, the emphasis from all cases is on how many\
    \ of the IoT works well to\nextract data and how long it will last to defend itself\
    \ when a cyberattack happens. In this work, we\ndeﬁne the well-being level of\
    \ information as “cyber wellness” in SWS. The goal of cyber wellness is,\ntherefore,\
    \ to store data as much as possible before a cyberattack and to withstand cyberattacks\
    \ as long\nas possible at the same time shown in Equation (2):\nCyber wellness\
    \ = max(Information security: capacity, endurance)\n(2)\nCyber wellness is unitless,\
    \ usually ranging from 0% to 100%. The higher cyber wellness reﬂects that\nthe\
    \ smart water system has more capacity to be against system failure and to prevent\
    \ information loss.\n5. Future Research Recommendations\nA few challenges in the\
    \ application of SWS are still waiting to be solved before the wide application\n\
    of a smart water system [47]. More coordination is needed for collective work\
    \ from the academia,\nindustry, and government to enable smart techniques for\
    \ public adoption. Based on the results of\nWater 2020, 12, 412\n19 of 25\nthis\
    \ review paper and the work from diﬀerent water organizations, several research\
    \ directions are\nrecommended to help engineers, researchers, and the public to\
    \ work on those challenges in a more\neﬃcient and focused way.\n5.1. Cyberattack\
    \ to Smart Water Micro-Components\nAs the latest information and data center systems\
    \ are vulnerable to hackers switching oﬀ the\npower easily, the smart equipment\
    \ being connected to the wider internet is revealed to be exposed to\ncyberattack\
    \ risks [98]. This ﬁnding reﬂects the current security problems in the IoTs are\
    \ a signiﬁcant\npublic concern. SWS, which is also on the basis of IoT, should\
    \ not ignore this concern, and it is required\nto build a strong defensive wall\
    \ to cyberattacks [52]. However, there are few studies discussing the\nprotection\
    \ of smart water micro-components. Diﬀerent smart devices such as sensors, loggers,\
    \ samplers,\nand controllers play roles of varying importance in water systems,\
    \ meaning that cyberattackers might\nselect the attacking intentionally in one\
    \ speciﬁc case. In this way, we need to develop eﬃcient methods\nand technologies\
    \ to benchmark the smart water micro-components protection eﬃciency. This will\n\
    budget the investment in the water system retroﬁtting where identical smart water\
    \ micro-components\nare required for diﬀerent defense costs.\n5.2. Resilience\
    \ Incorporation into Smart Water System\nThe resilience concept has been incorporated\
    \ into the traditional water distribution system,\nrainwater harvesting system,\
    \ storm drainage system, and wastewater system in some papers and\nprojects [99–102].\
    \ However, there are few papers discussing how to implement resilience in the\n\
    smart water system. The smart water system needs to be resilient since it involves\
    \ more recovery\nnot only in physical components but also in the intelligent ones.\
    \ In contrast to traditional water\nsystems, a smart water system has more complex\
    \ connections with automatic and online operations.\nThus, the performance of\
    \ SWS is determined by water, energy, and electricity availability. The\nnecessity\
    \ of incorporating resilience into the smart water system to evaluate their recovery\
    \ ability\nand function eﬃciency are therefore very important. Incorporating the\
    \ sub-resilience into the smart\nwater micro-components would also be a better\
    \ way to quantify the recovery capacity of the whole\nwater system.\n5.3. Smart\
    \ Water (End-User) Data Disaggregation and Analysis\nReal-time meter readings\
    \ generate massive data that require good organization and powerful\nanalytics\
    \ to extract useful information [103]. The high-resolution water data sampling\
    \ can enable\nend-user disaggregation to eﬃciently recognize the peak demand,\
    \ pipe leakage, and breakage [104,105].\nHowever, the smart water system ﬁeld\
    \ is still lacking proper data disaggregation and analysis tools.\nThe development\
    \ of data analysis tools that utilize the processed data to obtain water consumption\n\
    information such as peak hourly consumption, end-uses, or comparative analysis\
    \ is still at the formative\nstage [106]. Multi-Resolution data availability can\
    \ assist utilities in obtaining beneﬁts from data\nsampling and the cost of high-resolution\
    \ metering, real-time data-model coupling, and maintaining\nmetering infrastructures\
    \ [67,72]. These are the most critical challenges requiring urgent research\n\
    attention as the eﬃcient end-user data analysis approach can beneﬁt the customers’\
    \ billing and costs.\nSuch work will provide insight into future big water data\
    \ management research and commercial\napplications [107–109].\n6. Conclusions\n\
    This paper has conducted a critical review of studies that deal with smart water\
    \ techniques\napplied in water systems, with a particular focus on the understanding\
    \ of how to address the key\ncomponents for the framework of the smart water system\
    \ (SWS). Four critical components composed\nof the SWS (instrument layer, property\
    \ layer, function layer, beneﬁt layer, and application layer) and\ntwo metrics\
    \ (smartness and cyber wellness) are proposed to characterize SWS. In this review,\
    \ a total\nWater 2020, 12, 412\n20 of 25\nnumber of 32 literature including 1\
    \ international forum, 17 peer-reviewed papers, 10 reports, and 4\npresentations,\
    \ explicitly supporting the smart water system’s deﬁnition, architecture, and\
    \ metrics, are\nanalyzed. The main conclusions drawn from this study can be summarized\
    \ as follows:\n1.\nThe lack of consensus in the deﬁnition and architecture of\
    \ a smart water system and metrics of\nintelligent water system assessment is\
    \ hindering the process of smart techniques entering the\nwater sector;\n2.\n\
    A systematic and comprehensive smart water system framework is put forward including\
    \ critical\nelements like the deﬁnition, architecture, metrics, and research directions,\
    \ which can be directly\napplicable for education, research, and public knowledge;\n\
    3.\nTwo conceptual metrics (smartness and cyber wellness) to evaluate the performance\
    \ of the smart\nwater system are proposed to characterize system eﬃciency and\
    \ information security;\n4.\nExisting challenges drive concentration on future\
    \ research directions, and these future tasks can\nbe viewed as a synthetic work\
    \ where the academia, industry, and government will join in together.\nOverall,\
    \ this review has deﬁned what SWS is and established a systematic framework for\
    \ SWS,\nincluding architecture and metrics of SWS, which also shows that SWS has\
    \ great potential to maximize\nthe beneﬁts in water sectors over the coming decades.\
    \ This study is useful for designing assessing, and\nrehabilitating SWS when diﬀerent\
    \ goals are required in practical applicability in the ﬁeld or lab. Future\nresearch\
    \ directions are also clariﬁed for this cross-disciplinary work, to assist the\
    \ water areas to move\ntowards a smarter future. As smart water technologies are\
    \ under development, more real-world tests\nwill be needed to realize the full\
    \ beneﬁts of smart water system.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, J.L.;\

    Intelligence (AI) have been employed in agriculture over a long \nperiod of time,\
    \ alongside other advanced computing technologies. \nHowever, increased attention\
    \ is currently being paid to the use of \nsuch smart technologies. Agriculture\
    \ has provided an important \nsource of food for human beings over many thousands\
    \ of years, \nincluding the development of appropriate farming methods for \n\
    different types of crops. The emergence of new advanced IoT \ntechnologies has\
    \ the potential to monitor the agricultural \nenvironment to ensure high-quality\
    \ products. However, there \nremains a lack of research and development in relation\
    \ to Smart \nSustainable Agriculture (SSA), accompanied by complex \nobstacles\
    \ arising from the fragmentation of agricultural \nprocesses, i.e. the control\
    \ and operation of IoT/AI machines; data \nsharing and management; interoperability;\
    \ and large amounts of \ndata analysis and storage. This study firstly, explores\

    \ Smart Sustainable \nAgriculture solutions \nI. \nINTRODUCTION \nAgriculture\
    \ forms a critical activity vital to the survival of \nhumanity for approximately\
    \ many thousands of years [1].This \nrelationship has resulted in the advancement\
    \ of agricultural \nactivities, initially through the time-consuming methods of\
    \ \ntraditional agriculture [2]. The current recent rapid increase in \nin the\
    \ global population (predicted to rise to 8.9 billion by \n2050) has now led to\
    \ an urgent need to balance demand and \nsupply through the use of new technologies\
    \ [3] to increase food \nproduction [4, 5]. This development places pressure on\
    \ natural \nresources, with agriculture now consuming 70% of the world‟s \nfresh\
    \ water supply for the purposes of irrigation. Limited \nresources and the impact\
    \ of climate change will therefore lead \nto considerable challenges in producing\
    \ sufficient high quality \nfood to support the population [6]. Smart Agricultural\
    \ is a \nglobal initiative to preserve resources and maintain sustainable \nagriculture\
    \ [7]. Recently, researchers have adopted the Internet \nof Things (IoT) [8, 9],\
    \ with a number of studies emphasizing \nthe adoption and implementation of IoT\
    \ in agriculture, \nfarming, and irrigation [10]. Around the globe, many private\
    \ \ncompanies and organizations are now focusing on investigating \nnew technologies\
    \ to create a smarter agriculture environment. \nThese include mechanical and\
    \ economic aspects, engineering, \nfood retailers and computing. However, agricultural\
    \ processes \nare fragmented, resulting in a number of issues, i.e. difficulties\
    \ \nin operating and managing smart machines, data sharing and \nmanagement, data\
    \ analysis and storage [11, 12]. It is therefore \nimportant to facilitate cooperation\
    \ when developing standards \nfor smart agriculture, while also enhancing interoperability\
    \ \namong different stakeholders, systems and technologies [13]. \nThe use of\
    \ IoT and AI technologies has the potential to \nresult in a positive transformation\
    \ of traditional agriculture [3], \nincluding: (a) improved use of data collected\
    \ from smart \nagriculture sensors; (b) managing and governing the internal \n\
    processes within the smart agriculture environment (including \nthe management\
    \ of the harvesting and storage of crops); (c) \nwaste reduction and cost saving;\
    \ (d) increasing business \nefficiency by means of automating traditional processes;\
    \ and \n(e) improving the quality and volume of products [14]. A major \nchallenge\
    \ is to provide farmers with the required information in \na rapid manner [15].\
    \ AI therefore has significant potential to \naddress the urgent challenges faced\
    \ by traditional agriculture. \nThere has, over previous decades, been considerable\
    \ research \nand application of AI, including in: (a) smart agriculture; (b) \n\
    robotics; (c) agricultural optimization management; (d) \nautomation; (e) agricultural\
    \ expert systems; (f) agricultural \nknowledge-based systems; and (g) decision\
    \ support systems \n[16]. \nThere remains a lack of research and development in\
    \ \nrelation to Smart Sustainable Agriculture (SSA), accompanied \nby complex\
    \ obstacles arising from the fragmentation of \nagricultural processes, i.e. the\
    \ control and operation of IoT/AI \nmachines; data sharing and management; interoperability;\
    \ and \nlarge amounts of generated data analysis and storage. \nTherefore, this\
    \ study firstly, explores existing IoT/AI \ntechnologies adopted for SSA and secondly,\
    \ establishes an \nIoT/AI technical architecture to underpin SSA platforms, in\
    \ \norder to tackle fragmentation in traditional agriculture \nprocesses and enrich\
    \ the research and development of future \nsmart agriculture worldwide via establishment\
    \ of a Smart, \nSustainable Agriculture platform as a solution. \nThere now follows\
    \ an outline of the methodology \nunderpinning this research, supported by related\
    \ work \nhighlighting the history of smart agriculture, smart and \nadvanced computing\
    \ technologies and examples of IoT/AI \ntechnologies in current agricultural practices.\

    \ \nby an in-depth discussion of Smart Agriculture and IoT/AI \nSSA technical\
    \ architecture, along with the most significant \noutcomes from this study. The\
    \ paper finishes with concluding \nremarks and plans for future work. \nII. BACKGROUND\
    \ \nDue to the lack of literature concerning the development of \nIoT frameworks\
    \ for SSA, this study focuses on: (a) the history \nof smart agriculture, its\
    \ potential and challenges; (b) smart and \nadvanced computing technologies; and\
    \ (c) existing smart, \nsustainable agricultural frameworks. \nA. Smart Sustainable\
    \ Agriculture \nThere has recently been considerable research into SSA, \nemploying\
    \ various different terms, including Precision \nFarming, Smart Irrigation and\
    \ Smart Greenhouse. This paper \ncommences with an examination of these concepts\
    \ to \ndetermine the definition of SSA used in this study. \nPrecision Farming\
    \ refers to a method of managing farms \nand conserving resources through the\
    \ use of IoT and \nInformation and Communication Technologies (ICT). It \nobtains\
    \ real-time data concerning the condition of farm \nelements, (i.e. crops, soil\
    \ and air) to protect the environment \nwhile ensuring profits and sustainability\
    \ [15]. Smart Irrigation \nis a method of improving the efficiency of irrigation\
    \ processes \nand reducing water losses, while conserving existing water \nresources\
    \ using IoT-based smart irrigation systems [16]. \nDrones are employed in many\
    \ agricultural applications, \nincluding monitoring field crops and livestock,\
    \ and scanning \nlarge areas, while sensors on the ground collect a huge range\
    \ of \ninformation [13]. Smart greenhouses promote the cultivation of \ncrops\
    \ with the least degree of human intervention possible, \nthrough use of continuously\
    \ monitored climatic conditions (i.e. \nhumidity, \ntemperature, luminosity \n\
    and \nsoil \nmoisture), \ntriggering automated actions based on the evaluated\
    \ changes \nand implementing corrective action to maintain the most \nbeneficial\
    \ conditions for growth [17]. \nFarm Management Systems (FMS) can assist farmers\
    \ with \na variety of collected information, by managing and controlling \nvarious\
    \ \ntracking \ndevices \nand \nsensors. \nThe \ncollected \ninformation is analysed\
    \ for the undertaking of complex \ndecision-making tasks before being placed in\
    \ a storage \nmedium. This enables the use of the most effective agricultural\
    \ \ndata analysis practices [18]. Soil Monitoring Systems help to \ntrack and\
    \ improve the quality of soil through the monitoring of \nits physical, chemical,\
    \ and biological properties. Livestock \nmonitoring systems provide real-time\
    \ assessment of the \nproductivity, health and welfare of livestock, to promote\
    \ the \nhealth of animals [19]. The IoT/AI SSA platform Cloud offers \nreal-time\
    \ information to farmers to facilitate decision-making \nand reduce operational\
    \ costs, while at the same time enhancing \nproductivity. Following a review of\
    \ a considerable amount of \nresearch, we define SSA as the utilization process\
    \ of IoT/AI \ntechnologies to establish, monitor, manage, process and \nanalyse\
    \ data generated from various agricultural resources, \nsuch as field, crops,\
    \ livestock and others to ensure the \nsustainability and quality of agricultural\
    \ products and further \nenrich decision-making taken by stakeholders. \nB. Smart\
    \ and Advanced Computing Technologies \nThis section provides an overview of appropriate\
    \ \ntechnologies \nunderpinning \nthe \ndevelopment \nof \nsmart, \nsustainable\
    \ agriculture platforms, including: IoT; Big Data \nAnalytics (BDA); Cloud Computing\
    \ (CC); Mobile Computing \n(MC); and Artificial Intelligence (AI): \n1) Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT): IoT is a technology aimed at \nconnecting all intelligent objects\
    \ within a single network, i.e. \nthe Internet. It involves all kinds of computer\
    \ technologies, \nboth (a) hardware (i.e. intelligent boards and sensors) and\
    \ \n(b) software (i.e. advanced operating systems and AI \nalgorithms). Its primary\
    \ target is the establishment of \napplications for devices, in order to enable\
    \ the monitoring and \ncontrol of a specific domain. It has been widely adopted\
    \ in \nmany areas, i.e. industrial business processes; home machines; \nhealth\
    \ applications; and smart homes and cities. IoT \nconnectivity encompasses people,\
    \ machines, tools and \nlocations, aiming to achieve different intelligent functions\
    \ from \ndata sharing and information exchange [17]. However, it is \nprimarily\
    \ used in agriculture for management of agricultural \nproducts \nwithin \ngathered\
    \ \nreal-time \ndata, \nalongside: \n(1) searching; (2) tracking; (3) monitoring;\
    \ (4) control; (5) \nmanaging; (6) evaluating; and (7) operations within a supply\
    \ \nchain [1, 9]. \n2) Big Data Analytics (BDA): BDA refers to the large \nvolume\
    \ of data gathered from different datasets sources over a \nlong period of time,\
    \ i.e. sensor, Internet and business data. The \ndatasets used in this technology\
    \ surpass the computational and \nanalytical capabilities of typical software\
    \ applications and \nstandard database infrastructure. Its primary task is to\
    \ capture, \nstore, analyze and search for data, as well as seeking to identify\
    \ \nconcealed patterns in the gathered data. Thus, BDA involved \nthe utilization\
    \ of: (a) tools, (i.e. classification and clustering); \n(b) techniques, (i.e.\
    \ data mining, machine learning and \nstatistical analysis); and (c) technologies\
    \ (i.e. Hadoop and \nspark). These go beyond traditional data analytical approaches,\
    \ \nbeing employed to extract beneficial knowledge from a \nconsiderable amount\
    \ of data, in order to facilitate timely and \naccurate decision–making [17].\
    \ However, the use of BDA in \nagriculture focusses on management of the supply\
    \ chain of \nagricultural products, in order to enhance decision-making and \n\
    minimize the cost of production cost. It is also employed for \nthe analysis of\
    \ the properties of different types of soil for \nclassification and further enhancement.\
    \ Furthermore, it is \nuseful for the improved prediction and production of crops.\
    \ \n3) Cloud Computing (CC): CC has is a recent and rapidly \ngrowing phenomenon\
    \ within IT [18]. The Cloud is not \nrestricted to a particular business domain,\
    \ but has been \nimplemented to underpin and support various software \napplications\
    \ and platforms [19]. It offers easy access to the \nCloud provider‟s high-performance\
    \ and storage infrastructure \nover the Internet, with one of its main benefits\
    \ being to conceal \nfrom users the complexity of IT infrastructure management\
    \ \n[20] [21]. NIST [22] defined CC as “a model for enabling \nconvenient, on-demand\
    \ network access to a shared pool of \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced\
    \ Computer Science and Applications, \nVol. 10, No. 5, 2019 \n95 | P a g e  \n\
    www.ijacsa.thesai.org \nconfigurable computing resources (e.g. networks, servers,\
    \ \nstorage, applications and services) that can be rapidly \nprovisioned and\
    \ released with minimal management effort or \nservice provider interaction”.\
    \ The Cloud can be seen as high \nvirtualization method for datacenter infrastructure\
    \ distributed \nover a wide geographical area, linked by means of high \nbandwidth\
    \ network cables providing a variety of virtualized \nservices. These include\
    \ entire infrastructures, as well as small \nsoftware applications and different\
    \ types of services, i.e. high-\nperformance computing and large scalable storage\
    \ services \nbased on a pay-per-use model. CC can be divided into four \nmain\
    \ layers: (1) hardware; (2) infrastructure; (3) platform; and \n(4) application\
    \ [23]. The delivery of Cloud services can \ngenerally be divided into three different\
    \ models: (1) \nInfrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS); (2) Platform-as-a-Service\
    \ \n(PaaS); and (3) Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) [24, 25]. CC is \nconsidered\
    \ the most effective method of storing agricultural \ndata, along with IoT [1].\
    \ \n4) Mobile Computing (MC): MC refers to infrastructure in \nwhich data processing\
    \ and data storage take place externally to \nthe mobile device [26]. MC applications\
    \ transfer computing \npower, processing and data storage from mobile devices\
    \ in the \nCloud [27, 28]. MC has had a considerable impact on modern \ndaily\
    \ life, due to the availability and low cost of purchasing and \ncommunication.\
    \ It is now widely used in every field, including \nthe agricultural sector [29],\
    \ in which MC systems collect and \nsend daily data to farmers, informing them\
    \ of both the \nproduction status and weather conditions [29]. It is crucial to\
    \ \nuse automatic Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) efficient \ntraceability\
    \ systems to store and access data on electronic data \nchips in a more rapid\
    \ and accurate manner. It has been \nprimarily applied to the logistics of industrial\
    \ products, for the \npurposes of identification and to check delivery processes\
    \ [30]. \n5) Artificial Intelligence (AI): AI has been employed in \nsmart systems\
    \ over a long period of time[31], being the science \nof creating intelligent\
    \ machines to facilitate everyday life [32]. \nAI covers many areas, including\
    \ computer vision, data mining, \ndeep learning, image processing and neural networks\
    \ [16, 33]. \nAI technologies are now emerging to assist and improve \nefficiency\
    \ and tackle many of the challenges facing the \nagricultural industry, including\
    \ soil health, crop yield and \nherbicide-resistance. According to Sennaar [34],\
    \ agricultural \nAI Cloud applications fall into three main categories, as \n\
    discussed below. \na) Robots: these are developed and programmed to \nhandle fundamental\
    \ agricultural tasks (i.e. harvesting crops) \nmore rapidly and with a higher\
    \ capacity than human workers. \nExamples of robotic applications include: (a)\
    \ See and Spray \n(i.e. a weed control robot) and (b) Harvest CROO (i.e. a crop\
    \ \nharvesting robot). Agricultural robots have the potential to \nbecome valuable\
    \ AI applications, i.e. milking robots. \nb) Monitoring Crop and Soil: this employs\
    \ computer \nvision and deep-learning algorithms for processing captured \ndata\
    \ by sensors monitoring crop and soil health, i.e. the PEAT \nmachine for diagnosing\
    \ pests and soil defects, based on deep \nlearning application known as Plantix\
    \ that identifies potential \ndefects and nutrient deficiencies in the soil. A\
    \ further example \nis Trace Genomics, a machine learning based service for \n\
    diagnosing soil defects and providing soil analysis services to \nfarmers. This\
    \ uses machine learning to provide farmers with a \nsense of both the strengths\
    \ and weaknesses of their soil, with \nthe emphasis being on the prevention of\
    \ poor crops and \noptimizing the potential for healthy crop production. A \n\
    SkySquirrel technology is an example of the use of drones and \ncomputer vision\
    \ for crop analysis. \nc) Predictive Analytics: This analysis captured data, \n\
    based on machine learning models capable of tracking and \npredicting various\
    \ environmental impacts on crop harvest, i.e. \nchanges in weather. Examples of\
    \ such AI technologies include \n(a) aWhere (i.e. prediction of weather and crop\
    \ sustainability) \nand (b) Farmshots (i.e. monitoring of crop health and \nsustainability).\
    \ Crop and soil monitoring technologies are \nimportant applications for addressing\
    \ issues related to climate \nchange. IoT/AI technologies (such as drone and satellite)\
    \ that \ngenerate a large amount of data on a daily basis have the \npotential\
    \ to enable agricultural production to forecast changes \nand detect opportunities.\
    \ It is predicted that, over the coming \nyears, IoT and AI applications will\
    \ attract a considerable \ndegree of interest from large industrial agricultural\
    \ enterprises \n[34]. \nThe benefits and advantages of the agricultural use of\
    \ IoT \nare as follows: (a) efficiency of input; (b) cost reduction; \n(c) profitability;\
    \ (d) sustainability; (e) food safety and \nenvironmental protection [35]. However,\
    \ Ferrández-Pastor, et \nal. [36] considered SSA to contain a number of barriers\
    \ \npotentially hindering its adoption: (a) initial expectations and \nadvantages\
    \ remaining unfulfilled; (b) complexity of technology \nand incompatibility of\
    \ components; (c) a lack of products; and \n(d) the high cost involved in the\
    \ establishment and \nmaintenance of such facilities. To ensure the adoption and\
    \ \nimprovement of smart technologies in the agriculture sector, it \nis vital\
    \ for farmers to be trained and given up-to-date \nknowledge of IoT/AI technologies.\
    \ Furthermore, it is crucial to \ntest and validate IoT/AI applications, due to\
    \ the high risk \ninvolved in the adoption of these technologies in a critical\
    \ \nsector, along with the influence of environmental factors. \nC. Examples of\
    \ IoT/AI Technologies in Current Agriculture \nPractices \nThere are many types\
    \ of IoT and AI sensors and \napplications in current agricultural studies and\
    \ development. \nTable 1 provides an overview of the most commonly employed \n\
    IoT/AI platforms/technologies found in smart agriculture. \nD. Examples of an\
    \ Existing AI/IoT Research in Smart \nAgriculture \nThere are a number of specific\
    \ challenges that need to be \nconsidered before investing in smart agriculture,\
    \ primarily \nthose falling into the following categories: (1) hardware; \n(2)\
    \ data analysis; (3) maintenance; (4) mobility; and \n(5) infrastructure [56].\
    \ Nonetheless, there are many research \nefforts in the field of IoT/AI to support\
    \ the creation and \nestablishment of SSA, as shown in Table 2. \n(IJACSA) International\

    \ \nTABLE II. \nIOT/AI RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IN SMART SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE\
    \ \nResearcher/s \nYear \nSummary \nRay [57] \n2017 \nThe researchers undertook\
    \ a review of various potential IoT applications, including the specific issues\
    \ and challenges associated \nwith IoT deployment to improve farming. They comprehensively\
    \ analyzed the specific requirements the devices and wireless \ncommunication\
    \ technologies associated with agricultural IoT applications. They presented different\
    \ case studies to explore existing \nIoT based solutions operated by various organizations\
    \ and individuals, followed by categorizing them based on their deployment \n\
    parameters. Furthermore, they identified a number of factors for the improvement\
    \ and future road map of work using IoT. \nMekala and \nViswanathan [58] \n2017\
    \ \nThe researchers surveyed a number of conventional applications of Agricultural\
    \ IoT Sensor Monitoring Network technologies \nutilizing CC. Their study aimed\
    \ at understanding the diverse technologies to build smart, sustainable agriculture.\
    \ They addressed a \nsimple IoT agriculture model with a wireless network. \n\
    Kamilaris, et al. \n[59] \n2017 \nThe researchers reviewed work in agriculture\
    \ employing the practice of big data analysis to solve various different problems.\
    \ \nTheir review emphasized the opportunities provided by big data analysis for\
    \ the development of smarter agriculture, the availability of \nhardware and software,\
    \ as well as the techniques and methods for big data analysis. \nRajeswari, et\
    \ al. \n[29] \n2017 \nThe researchers investigated a number of different features,\
    \ i.e. humidity, temperature sensing, server-based remote monitoring \nsystem\
    \ detection and soil moisture sensing. They used sensor networks to measure temperature,\
    \ moisture and humidity in place of \nmanual checking. They deployed several sensors\
    \ in different locations within farms, using a single controller. Their major\
    \ objective \nwas to collect real-time data of the agriculture production environment\
    \ to establish an easy access agricultural advice, in order to \nidentify weather\
    \ or crops patterns. \nAntonacci, et al. \n[5] \n2018 \nThe researchers attempted\
    \ to provide nanotechnology-based (bio) sensors to support farmers in delivering\
    \ an analysis that is \naccurate, fast, cost-effective, and useful in the field\
    \ to identify water and soil nutrients/pesticides, soil humidity, and plant pathogens.\
    \ \nCadavid, et al. \n[60] \n2018 \nThe researchers proposed an extension to a\
    \ popular open-source IoT platform, known as „Thingsboard‟. This formed the core\
    \ of a \nCloud-based Smart Farming platform and deliberate sensors, a decision\
    \ support system, and a configuration of remotely autonomous \nand controlled\
    \ machines (e.g. water dispensers, rovers or drones). \nSoto-Romero, et \nal.\
    \ [61] \n2019 \nThe researchers designed an easily insertable cylindrical sensor\
    \ with internal electronics to offer a low power electronic \narchitecture to\
    \ measure and communicate wirelessly with a LoRa, Sigfox network or mobile phones.\
    \ \nNóbrega, et al. \n[62] \n2019 \nThe researchers reviewed the proposed stack\
    \ and details of the recent developments within smart agriculture, focusing on\
    \ \nIoT/Machine-2-Machine interaction. They described the design and deployment\
    \ of a gateway addressing the requirements of the \nSheepIT service, evaluating\
    \ this gateway using real scenarios in terms of performance, thus demonstrating\
    \ its feasibility and \nscalability. \nIII. METHODOLOGY \nAs well as undertaking\
    \ the literature review, the current \nresearcher enhanced this study by informally\
    \ interviewing \nexperienced farmers. The study aims to establish an IoT/AI \n\
    SSA architecture, as well as exploring the potential of the use \nof IoT and AI\
    \ as a backbone to establish an SSA platform. A \nreview was employed to identify,\
    \ analyze and study key books, \njournals, reports, and white papers, in order\
    \ to achieve the \nabove-noted aim. The lack of existing studies in this area\
    \ \nensures that this current research also contributes to the body of \nknowledge\
    \ by establishing an IoT/AI framework for the \nadoption of smart technologies,\
    \ in order to establish smart \nsustainable \nagricultural \npractices. \nFig.\
    \ \n1 \nshows \nthe \nmethodology adopted for this study. \nIV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\
    \ \nBased on the research aim outlined in the Methodology, \nthis section is divided\
    \ into (A) Domains of Smart Sustainable \nagricultural model; (B) B. Proposed\
    \ IOT/AI SSA platform as a \nsolution; and (C) Proposed IoT/AI technical architecture\
    \ for \nSSA platform. \nA. Domains of Smart Sustainable Agricultural Model \n\
    The results from the literature review revealed that several \ndomains need to\
    \ be considered when adopting the smart \nagricultural model. Fig. 2 demonstrates\
    \ the interrelation and \ncomplexity of data flow between different Smart, Sustainable\
    \ \nAgriculture domains. \n \nFig. 1. IoT/SSA Research Methodology. \n(IJACSA)\
    \ International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, \nVol.\
    \ 10, No. 5, 2019 \n98 | P a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org \n \nFig. 2. Chaotic\
    \ Data Flow and Interrelation of SSA Domains. \nThese domains are discussed individually,\
    \ as follows: \n Human resources: This refers to people, policies and \npractices\
    \ within the agricultural environment, which are \nas important as in any other\
    \ domain, as are weather and \ntechnology. Human resources receive careful attention,\
    \ \ndue to their significant impact on production, as well as \nfinancial and\
    \ marketing decisions. Whatever its size, an \nagricultural concern requires effective\
    \ human resources \nmanagement and planning, including hiring and \nkeeping employees\
    \ who are engaged, high-performing \nand effective communicators. Providing up-to-date\
    \ \nknowledge potentially opens the means to adopt smart \ntechnologies in an\
    \ agricultural environment. \n Crops: This refers to a plant that can be grown\
    \ and \nharvested extensively for subsistence or profit: (1) food \ncrops (i.e.\
    \ for human consumption); (2) feed crops (i.e. \nfor livestock consumption); (3)\
    \ fibre crops (i.e. for \ncordage and textiles); and (4) oil crops (i.e. for \n\
    consumption or industrial uses). \n Weather: This plays a major role in determining\
    \ the \nsuccess of agricultural processes. Most field crops and \nlivestock are\
    \ solely dependent on climactic conditions \nto provide life-sustaining water\
    \ and energy. Adverse \nweather can cause losses in agricultural products, \n\
    particularly during critical stages of growth. The \nelements of weather (solar\
    \ radiation, temperature, \nprecipitation, humidity and wind) influence the \n\
    physiology and production of agricultural plants and \nanimals. Severe weather\
    \ (i.e. tornadoes, drought, \nflooding, hail and wind storms) can cause considerable\
    \ \ndamage and destruction to fields and livestock. \n Soil: This forms a critical\
    \ aspect of successful \nagriculture, being the source of nutrients used to grow\
    \ \ncrops, which are subsequently passed into plants and \nthen to humans and\
    \ animals. Healthy soils produce \nhealthy and rich food supplies; however the\
    \ health of \nsoil tends to decline over time, forcing farmers to move \nto new\
    \ fields. Soil health depends on regional \nconditions and climates, with soil\
    \ nutrients more likely \nto deteriorate in dry climates, particularly if irrigated,\
    \ \nwhich, if not managed carefully, can result in \nsalinization, i.e. a build-up\
    \ in the level of salts and \nchemicals contained in water. Healthy and rich soil\
    \ can \nbe achieved through the use of IoT sensors to monitor \nits chemical status,\
    \ using specific sensors (e.g. moisture \nsensors), whose data readings are transferred\
    \ to the data \nmanagement and analysis layer for analysis, assisting \ndecisions\
    \ concerning the need for fertilizer. \n Pests: These consist of any living creature\
    \ that is \ninvasive, or damaging to crops, livestock or human \nstructures. Pests\
    \ often occur in high quantities, to the \ndetriment of agricultural products.\
    \ It is vital to control \nand monitor these creatures by means of IoT/AI \ntechnologies,\
    \ to avoid serious diseases, including \nplague and malaria, as well as plant\
    \ and livestock \ndiseases. \n Fertilization: Soils naturally contain many nutrients,\
    \ \ni.e. nitrogen, phosphorous, calcium and potassium. \nCrops are unable to function\
    \ effectively and produce \nhigh quality food when their nutrient level is low.\
    \ The \nnatural levels of nutrients in the soil need to be \nenhanced by the addition\
    \ of nutrients once crops have \nbeen harvested. Fertilizers have been used since\
    \ the \nbeginning of agriculture, but it is now recognized that \ntheir extensive\
    \ use can, if not correctly controlled, harm \nthe environment. Therefore, farmers\
    \ use IoT sensors to \nread and test soil samples for baseline testing to enable\
    \ \nthem to add fertilizers using correct and appropriate \nmeasurements. Fertilization\
    \ is an important method of \nmaintaining \nsustainable \nagricultural \nproduction\
    \ \nsystems. \n Agricultural Products: These are derived from \ncultivating crops\
    \ or livestock to sustain or enhance \nhuman life. Human beings also use a wide\
    \ collection of \nagricultural products on a daily basis, i.e. food and \nclothing.\
    \ Agricultural products fall into the following \ngroups: (a) grains; (b) foods;\
    \ (c) fuels; (d) fibres; \n(e) livestock; and (f) raw materials. Food is the most\
    \ \nextensively produced agricultural product. \n Irrigation/Water: Water demand\
    \ in agriculture is now \nrising globally and particularly in Mediterranean \n\
    countries, increasing the pressure to preserve available \nfreshwater resources.\
    \ Smart, sustainable agriculture \nprocesses should therefore focus on new and\
    \ efficient \ntechniques to improve agricultural productivity, which \npromote\
    \ considerable savings in terms of food \nconsumption and wasted water. \n Livestock:\
    \ These are animals raised in a domesticated \nagricultural environment, for the\
    \ purposes of labour and \nto produce commodities such as eggs, meat, milk, fur,\
    \ \nwool and leather. Animal husbandry is a component of \ncurrent agriculture\
    \ and refers to the breeding, \nmaintenance and slaughter of livestock. \n Machines:\
    \ Agricultural equipment is any kind of \nmachinery used to assist with farming.\
    \ Such machines \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science\
    \ and Applications, \nVol. 10, No. 5, 2019 \n99 | P a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org\
    \ \ncan be light or heavy, i.e. tractors. Modern farm \nmachinery is seen as the\
    \ important driver for increased \nagricultural \nsustainability, \nefficiency\
    \ \nand \ncompetitiveness. Smart technologies can reduce the \nimpact of farming\
    \ practices within global agriculture. \nThe current development of agricultural\
    \ machinery \naddresses environmental challenges, while increasing \nproductivity\
    \ and bringing economic benefits. These \nsmart agricultural machines should be:\
    \ (a) fast, \naccurate, versatile and intelligent; (b) produce less CO2 \nemissions\
    \ and (c) make use of bioenergy. \n Fields: This refers to an area of land used\
    \ for \nagricultural purposes, i.e. crops, cultivation or for \nlivestock. Many\
    \ fields have borders composed of a strip \nof bushes used to provide both food\
    \ and cover, in order \nto ensure the survival of wildlife. Monitoring field \n\
    activities using IoT devices can have a significantly \npositive impact on controlling\
    \ objects within the field. \nB. Proposed IOT/AI SSA Platform as a Solution \n\
    This platform would prove a valuable medium to facilitate \ndata flow and sharing\
    \ among SSA domains. Many researchers \nhave developed IoT architectures, but\
    \ their efforts have tended \nto target specific areas of IoT/AI, i.e. sensors\
    \ or weather \nmonitoring systems [58, 60, 61]. This current paper is \nproposing\
    \ a holistic IoT/AI platform to cover all areas within a \nSSA environment, performing\
    \ the following tasks: (a) manage \nand govern data flow between SSA domains;\
    \ (b) facilitate the \nintegration of the different components of SSA architecture;\
    \ \n(c) tackle interoperability issues caused by the utilization of \ndifferent\
    \ tools and software; (d) provide easy-to-use interfaces \nfor interaction; (e)\
    \ provide an ability to generate reports based \non real-time data and keep it\
    \ updated; (f) store generated data \nin sustainable storage place (i.e. the Cloud),\
    \ to enable it to \npermanently recorded for future reuse; (g) isolate different\
    \ \nlayers to improve the development process in the future; and \n(h) the platform\
    \ should consist of several nodes, so that, in the \ncase of any failure, other\
    \ nodes can keep the system up and \nrunning. Fig. 3 shows how the SSA-IoT/AI\
    \ platform would be \nused at the center of the SSA domain to facilitate business\
    \ \nprocess and data flow and to share within a smart, sustainable \nagricultural\
    \ environment. \n \nFig. 3. Proposed SSA-IoT/AI Platform. \nC. Proposed IoT/AI\
    \ Technical Architecture for SSA Platform \nFig. 4 shows the overall AI/IoT technical\
    \ architecture for \nSSA. It consists of two main components: (a) the first \n\
    component: SSA Layers and AI/IoT technologies; and (b) the \nsecond component:\
    \ data lifecycle within SSA architecture and \ndata process location. In order\
    \ to provide additional detail \nconcerning the framework, the following description\
    \ gives \nfurther details about each component: \n1) The First component: Smart\
    \ Sustainable Agriculture \n(SSA) layers and (SSA) AI/IoT technologies \nThe first\
    \ component of smart, sustainable agriculture \n(SSA), AI/IOT framework, consists\
    \ of the following layers: \n(a) Physical Hardware and Storage layer; (b) AI and\
    \ Data \nManagement layer, and Governance layer; (c) Network layer; \n(d) Security\
    \ layer; (e) Application layer; (f) IoT and sensing \nlayer; and (g) SSA domain\
    \ layer. Fig. 4 demonstrates the \nfollowing description of each layer, highlighting\
    \ its primary \nrole: \n Physical hardware and Storage layer: This layer \nconsists\
    \ of powerful hardware to host virtualized \nmachines, as well as dedicated traditional\
    \ storage \nmedium, cloud storage solutions or hybrid storage \nsolutions. It\
    \ contains the supporting hardware for IoT \ndevices that exist in Internet of\
    \ Thins and Sensing layer. \n Artificial Intelligence and Data Management Layer:\
    \ \nThis layer is responsible for managing processes and \ncontrolling the business\
    \ logic, focussing on three main \nactivities: (i) data analysis and processing,\
    \ using data \nmining and intelligence statistical analysis on generated \ndata;\
    \ (ii) data classification and transformation, using \nontologies, and machine\
    \ learning to classify and \ntransform analysed data; and (iii) data interpretation,\
    \ \nrepresenting the transformed data into knowledge to \nmake machines smarter.\
    \ \n Network Layer: This layer contains all the different \ntypes of network\
    \ connections exist, with this cloud \nconsisting \nof \nwired \nor \nwireless\
    \ \nnetwork \nconnections/devices. It is important that this layer uses \nthe\
    \ latest networking technologies to keep up with the \nmost recent developments\
    \ in other sectors. Its main job \nis to facilitate the transaction of all data\
    \ to and from \ndifferent \nlayers \nwithin \nthe \narchitecture. \nThe \ntechnologies\
    \ of IoT in this layer include Internet, WIFI \nand GSM/CMDA. It is responsible\
    \ for data accessibility \nand availability throughout other layers. Further,\
    \ it \nmanages data and its flow within between all layers. \n Security Layer:\
    \ This layer is responsible for data \nsecurity transferred among different layers\
    \ and should \nbe the means of addressing any security concerns and \nvulnerabilities\
    \ within all other IoT/SSA layers, i.e. \nmalware, spyware and viruses. It should\
    \ employ up-to-\ndate security solutions and AI algorithms to block and \nquarantine\
    \ any threat to the platform. \n Applications Layers: This layer gathers different\
    \ \napplications related to smart sustainable agriculture. It \nis built based\
    \ on AI and data management layers. Many \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced\
    \ Computer Science and Applications, \nVol. 10, No. 5, 2019 \n100 | P a g e  \n\
    www.ijacsa.thesai.org \nsmart, sustainable agricultural applications could be\
    \ \ndeveloped and integrated into this layer, i.e. crop \nmonitoring \napplications\
    \ \nand \ndrone-controlled \napplications. This layer focuses on the supervision\
    \ \naspect of the data flow and migration between all layers \nand can provide\
    \ an authorized institution with full or \npartial governance on data migration,\
    \ transactions and \naccess. \n Internet of Things (IoT) and Sensing Layer: This\
    \ \nforms the first interaction layer with SSA domains. It \nuses and hosts various\
    \ types of IoT devices (e.g. \nsensors), capable of collecting data from real-world\
    \ \nobjects, sharing it to provide real-time data. Many \nsensors in the Cloud\
    \ are hosted and integrated within \nthis layer, i.e. humidity sensors, moisture\
    \ sensors and \nweather monitoring systems. Furthermore, this layer is \nresponsible\
    \ for operating robotic and drone actuators to \nassist in the mobility of intelligent\
    \ machines within the \nagricultural area. It thus allows intelligent machines\
    \ to \nmove between locations, in order to cover a wide area. \n SSA Domain Layer:\
    \ This layer hosts various different \nSmart Sustainable Architectural domains\
    \ and forms the \nmain source for data generated from various \nagricultural domains,\
    \ including: fields; machines; \nhuman resources; and crops. It forms the basis\
    \ for \nIOT/AI SSA platforms, as it contains various raw data \nformats without\
    \ interference. \n2) The Second component: data lifecycle within SSA \nArchitecture\
    \ and its process location: \nFig. 5 demonstrates that data lifecycle remains\
    \ in line with \nSSA Architecture layers. This commences with the original \n\
    data source, i.e. SSA domain layers. The acquisition and \ncapturing of data is\
    \ undertaken at the layer containing sensors \nand actuators. These captured data\
    \ are then passed to the \napplication layer for business logic and control, following\
    \ \nwhich, the data must be checked for security issues before \nmoving to data\
    \ analysis and processing. This is followed by \ndata classification and transformation\
    \ of the analyzed and \nprocessed data before it moves to data interpretation\
    \ and the \nresulting building decisions. The final stage is to store the data\
    \ \nfor future retrieval. \nThere are two locations for sharing and processing\
    \ of \ngenerated data. Firstly, on-site. Here, the generated data is \nmore likely\
    \ to be shared and processed within the location of \nthe agricultural field,\
    \ covering the four architecture layers: \n(1) SSA; (2) the domain layer; (3)\
    \ the IoT layer; and (4) the \napplication layer. Secondly, off-site: here the\
    \ sharing and \nprocessing of the generated data must be outsourced to the \n\
    physical location „data centre‟, in which data is processed and \nanalyzed away\
    \ from the field. It can cover the four architecture \nlayers: (1) network; (2)\
    \ AI and data management; (3) physical; \nand (4) storage. It is also important\
    \ to highlight that the \nSecurity layer forms a common layer between on-site\
    \ and off-\nsite processing locations. \n \nFig. 4. Overall AI/IoT Platform Technical\
    \ Architecture for SSA. \n \nFig. 5. IoT/AI Data Lifecycle. \n(IJACSA) International\
    \ Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, \nVol. 10, No. 5, 2019\
    \ \n101 | P a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org \nV. CONCLUSION \nThis paper has established\
    \ the importance of employing \nrecent and advanced computing technologies in\
    \ the agricultural \nsector, in particularly AI and IoT. Agriculture is considered\
    \ \ncentral to the survival of human beings. Supporting the current \npractices\
    \ of traditional agriculture with recent IoT/AI \ntechnologies can improve the\
    \ performance, quality and volume \nof production. This study has reviewed the\
    \ existing IoT/AI \ntechnologies discussed within the main research journals in\
    \ the \narea of agricultural. Furthermore, it categorized the main \ndomains of\
    \ smart, sustainable agriculture, i.e. human resources; \ncrops; weather; soil;\
    \ pests; fertilization; farming products; \nirrigation/water; livestock; machines;\
    \ and fields. The major \ncontribution of this paper concerns the AI/IoT technical\
    \ \narchitecture for SSA, leading to an emphasis on the research \nand development\
    \ of a unified AI/IoT platform for SSA, to \npositively resolve issues resulting\
    \ from the fragmentary nature \nof the agricultural process. Future work will\
    \ include \ninvestigation of the process of implementing AI/IoT \ntechnologies\
    \ for SSA by applying the proposed AI/IoT \ntechnical architecture in the form\
    \ of the prototype of a unified \nplatform on real test cases. This will identify\
    \ the relevant \nstrengthens and weaknesses for further improvement and \nenhancement.\

    1. Introduction

    The Internet of Things technology revolves around the core concept of integrating
    sen-

    sors into everyday objects and using connectivity to facilitate the exchange of
    information

    that is used in a variety of applications [1]. There are more everyday objects
    available than

    people, so the amount of connectivity that IoT devices hold is enormous [2]. In
    order to

    better understand the future of IoT technology, it is important to understand
    the unique

    circumstances that brought IoT to this point. A key distinction to make between
    the in-

    ternet and the IoT is that the internet is a mesh of networks, whereas the IoT
    network is

    an interconnected network of devices [3,4]. An early example of the ﬁrst IoT device
    was

    John Romkey’s creation, which enabled a toaster to be turned on or off over the
    internet

    in 1990 [5]. It is clear that Internet of Things devices have come a long way
    from their

    humble beginnings, and there are many factors that inﬂuenced this rise. These
    devices

    play an important role in people’s daily lives and involve the handling of massive
    amounts

    of data [6]. IoT devices can be seen as a network of interconnected devices that
    involves

    sending and actuating devices that provide the ability to share information across
    different

    platforms [7–21].

    The rapid rise in technology and computer system capabilities has had a major
    impact

    on the proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) technology. The impact of IoT
    systems will

    impact many different ﬁelds and will change the way society operates and moves
    toward

    the future, as shown in Figure 1. This paper discusses the use of IoT in four
    domains. As

    IoT devices become increasingly integrated into society, there are still numerous
    security

    challenges that pose a threat to their spread. Numerous technologies are being
    developed

    in order to help protect the safe use of IoT devices, and it is clear that advances
    in security

    will be critical moving forward into the future [22–27].

    Figure 1. IoT technology and diverse application domains.

    Numerous research works have been conducted to address various aspects of the

    Internet of Things (IoT), encompassing energy harvesting, device-to-device communication,

    energy efﬁciency, resource allocation, edge computing, security, privacy, and
    applications

    across different domains. Scholars have explored stochastic geometry analysis
    to optimize

    energy harvesting, proposed energy-efﬁcient systems, investigated untapped potential
    in

    spectrum utilization, developed reinforcement learning-based frameworks, and explored

    the integration of edge computing and artiﬁcial intelligence [28–42]. Additionally,
    studies

    have focused on addressing security concerns in these areas, including privacy-preserving

    data sharing, explainable AI, and motion tracking. Collectively, these research
    efforts

    contribute to a comprehensive understanding of IoT technologies and their applications
    in

    diverse ﬁelds [43–51].

    Many different strategies are being utilized by computing professionals in order
    to

    advance the ﬁeld of research in IoT technology [52–56]. In particular, machine
    learning and

    artiﬁcial intelligence have played key roles in advancing this emerging ﬁeld of
    computer

    science and will continue to do so in new and exciting ways [57]. It is critical
    for computer

    scientists to understand common machine learning and AI algorithms that are being

    used, as well as consider what research is currently being conducted to advance
    IoT

    technologies [58–73].

    The methodology followed for conducting the review involves a systematic literature

    search, a study selection based on predeﬁned criteria, data studies, a critical
    evaluation

    Sensors 2023, 23, 7194

    3 of 19

    of the selected studies, and a comprehensive discussion of the ﬁndings. This review
    aims

    to provide an overview of IoT applications and future directions in the selected
    domains,

    ensuring the inclusion of relevant research and a rigorous evaluation process.

    2. Applications of IoT Devices

    Since Internet of Things technology can be understood as devices/objects that
    are

    connected to a network, the applications of IoT devices are endless [74–80]. Leaders
    of

    different companies/organizations are recognizing the potential of IoT technology
    to make

    an impact and are investing more in these key pieces of technology in order to
    reap the

    beneﬁts [81]. Nearly any object can be outﬁtted with the appropriate technology
    that will be

    involved in the data transmission from IoT devices and their connected networks.
    Writing

    about the different applications would be a long and arduous process and it would
    be more

    beneﬁcial to ﬁrst understand the most common applications of IoT devices before
    exploring

    what the future holds. Figures 2 and 3 shows growth in IoT globally. The connectivity
    in

    different medical IoT devices is shown in Figure 4.

    Figure 2. The number of IoT devices is greater than the number of people [82].

    Figure 4. Connectivity in different medical IoT devices.

    2.1. Healthcare Applications

    The Internet of Medical Things (IoTM) is an emerging subﬁeld that is changing
    the

    way healthcare is being delivered through the use of IoT technology (Joyia). The
    use of

    IoT technology in healthcare has come a long way and continues to be a promising
    area

    for growth. Essential innovations, such as the AliveCor heart monitor, which relies
    on IoT

    sensors, show how useful technology can be when applied to healthcare in efforts
    to save

    lives [84]. Advances in technology have consistently played a major role in the
    healthcare

    industry, and IoT devices have found numerous applications in healthcare settings.
    One

    way that IoT devices are useful in healthcare is through the use of remote health
    monitoring

    in order to monitor patients at home rather than in hospitals [85]. The information
    that is

    collected from IoT devices is helpful in medical settings because it can be analyzed
    and used

    in ways such as early disease prediction [86]. IoT sensors even played a critical
    role during

    the COVID-19 pandemic in helping healthcare workers better monitor critical parameters

    that could save lives if changes were detected right away [87]. By examining these
    different

    IoT device applications in the healthcare industry, researchers can ﬁnd additional
    ways to

    advance this ﬁeld of research.

    The use of sensors is critical in the delivery of healthcare services [88]. Sensors
    in

    medical devices act as a bridge between the physical and information worlds by
    collecting

    a variety of data. Sensors are crucial in helping healthcare professionals monitor
    different

    vitals that are important to measure in order to understand a person’s health
    situation

    and act accordingly. Medical sensors can be used in a variety of ways in order
    to measure

    crucial information. Medical sensors are connected to IoT, and measure things
    such as

    temperature, respiration, heart rate, weight, skin conductance, galvanic response,
    blood

    ﬂow/SpO2, glucose testing, muscle contraction, and motion analysis [89]. The medical

    sensors are connected to wireless sensor networks, which relay useful information
    to

    different stakeholders involved in healthcare, such as patients, medical staff,
    insurers, and

    more [90]. The use of medical sensors is vast and can be used in crucial medical
    equipment,

    such as ECG monitors, glucose level sensing, and oxygen monitoring [91]. The goal
    of

    using any technology involved in healthcare is to promote better health outcomes,
    and IoT

    devices play a critical role in promoting this. Recent advances in IoT-related
    technology

    will continue to play a large role in creating stronger healthcare systems, and
    the future of

    healthcare will become increasingly reliant on technology [92].

    Medical sensors are important in collecting useful information about a patient’s
    health;

    however, this information is often very sensitive in nature, and this makes privacy
    a ma-

    jor concern moving forward. Security has always played a vital role in IoT technology;

    however, it matters even more in a situation such as healthcare, where IoT devices
    will be

    collecting sensitive information about patients that is private in nature [93].
    If a patient’s

    Sensors 2023, 23, 7194

    5 of 19

    medical information was compromised, this could lead to consequences for hospital
    orga-

    nizations that did not employ the proper security measures to prevent it. The
    privacy and

    conﬁdentiality of a patient’s medical information are core concerns when addressing
    the

    security vulnerabilities of healthcare IoT devices [94].

    There are many issues that present challenges to the successful use of IoT devices
    in

    healthcare and it is important to address these issues thoroughly when handling
    mission-

    critical operations, such as that of healthcare. Some important limitations that
    inﬂuence the

    use of IoT technology in medical devices include the need for high power consumption,

    the availability of limited resources, and handling security issues from the large
    number of

    devices being used [95].

    The use of IoT technology in healthcare is promising and exciting. There are many

    useful applications where IoT devices can be used as sensors, and this helps healthcare

    providers in a variety of ways. Moving forward, IoT technology will continue to
    expand,

    and this will ultimately beneﬁt healthcare organizations.

    2.2. Agriculture Applications

    As the population of the world grows at an exponential rate, the need for efﬁcient

    food delivery systems is becoming a core issue that is a driver behind the advancements
    in

    smart agriculture [96]. In addition to the growing demand, factors such as climate
    change

    and water scarcity have also played roles in the increasing demand for more efﬁcient

    agriculture systems [97]. Much of the technology around IoT implementation aims
    to

    reduce agricultural resource waste [98] as shown on Figure 5. The use of IoT technology
    in

    agricultural settings is critical to maintaining efﬁcient operations and represents
    another

    common use case of IoT technology. Food supply chains that deliver quality and
    quantity

    are important to feed the world, and having efﬁcient systems built around these
    supply

    chains will beneﬁt people all over the world [99]. The need for more efﬁcient
    food-delivery

    systems has helped to promote IoT use in agriculture because stakeholders saw
    the beneﬁts

    that technology could provide [100].

    Figure 5. Different types of agriculture applications for IoT.

    Sensors 2023, 23, 7194

    6 of 19

    One way that IoT technology can be used in agriculture is automation. Automation

    involves having devices/objects respond automatically to different conditions
    without the

    need for human interaction. Wireless sensor networks are key proponents in helping
    IoT

    devices achieve their automation goals [101]. This can be useful in massive operations,

    such as agriculture, because of its sheer scale and need for efﬁcient processes
    to maximize

    crop yields. For example, many sensors can be used in the soil of farmland in
    order to

    measure soil moisture content, in order to build systems that make better use
    of water for

    irrigation purposes [102]. These IoT devices can be used to measure soil conditions,
    such

    as water content, give appropriate signals when it is low, and turn on sprinkler
    systems

    automatically. Real-time monitoring and responses are very common and useful when

    understanding how IoT devices contribute to agriculture [103].

    Data analytics is another area where IoT plays an important role in agriculture.
    Col-

    lecting and analyzing data are very useful because they can give important insight
    into

    how effective or ineffective an operation is. These data can be used to provide
    stakeholders

    with important insight that will ultimately impact their decision-making [104].
    IoT devices

    collect massive amounts of data, and these data are useful when analyzed over
    time to

    help aid in decisions about estimation and forecasting [105]. The gathered data
    can be

    analyzed using machine learning methods that impact prediction, storage management,

    decision-making, farm management, and precision farming [96]. These data can become

    useful when attempting to implement more sustainable farming methods through the
    use

    of data-driven decision-making [104].

    Although there is a large demand for efﬁcient agriculture, there are other factors
    in

    play that have affected the proliferation of IoT devices in this sector. One key
    component

    that affects how widespread IoT devices are in agricultural applications is how
    costly it

    is to implement them in farming operations around the world [106]. Massive farming

    operations would require a large number of wireless sensors to collect data about
    a farming

    operation, and this can drastically increase the costs associated with implementing
    IoT in

    agriculture [107]. There are also many technical challenges that exist with implementing

    IoT technology in farms. Farms are often in large areas that are isolated and
    usually have

    poorer signals that impact their networking capabilities [108]. In addition to
    this, many

    farmers in rural parts of the world have limited knowledge of how to use IoT devices
    [109].

    2.3. Smart Home Applications

    Smart home applications represent promising use cases in which people beneﬁt from

    IoT technology and there are numerous advantages/disadvantages to consider. Smart
    home

    devices date back to the 1970s when the X10 protocol was ﬁrst conceived; this
    technology

    allowed for smart home devices to communicate properly [110]. IoT devices in smart

    homes can be used in a variety of ways, such as measuring home conditions, managing

    home appliances, and controlling home access [111]. Home automation remains a
    core

    feature around which IoT technology is applied [112]. For example, there are numerous

    home appliances that can be turned on and equipped with IoT technology in order
    to

    become more efﬁcient and convenient [113]. There are many beneﬁts that extend
    beyond

    convenience. The use of IoT sensors in smart homes can be used to assist the elderly
    in

    turning hard-to-reach devices on/off and even detect falls through the use of
    ﬂoor or

    camera sensors [114]. The market is being driven by the rising popularity of smart
    devices,

    such as speakers offered by Amazon and Google. According to a recently released
    report

    by Strategy Analytics, the global smart home market has had a positive outcome
    in recent

    years [115]. The report further estimates a compound annual growth rate (CAGR)
    of 10%

    from 2018 to 2023, leading to a market value of USD 155 billion, as shown in Figure
    6.

    Sensors 2023, 23, 7194

    7 of 19

    Figure 6. Households with smart systems: global total [115].

    There are many techniques utilized in order to bring smart home technology to
    life.

    One important method relies on radio frequency identiﬁcation (RFID) systems in
    order to

    act as enabler technologies for IoT [116]. RFID is an important technology that
    helps in

    identifying objects, recording data, and even controlling individual targets through
    the use

    of radio waves [117]. RFID devices can be used in a variety of ways. For example,
    higher

    education institutions can utilize RFID technology in student identiﬁcation cards
    [118].

    RFID technology is also used to detect the indoor roaming activity of elderly
    individuals

    and the data collected are used to provide more insight into the health of elderly
    individuals

    who live alone [119].

    In an ideal future, IoT devices would be able to seamlessly communicate together
    [7].

    There are many challenges that exist in the use of smart home IoT technology.
    Interoperabil-

    ity is one issue because the cost of using smart home technology is important
    to consider,

    and the integration of devices is a concern moving forward [120]. Different technologies

    utilized by IoT devices in order to create this connectivity include Wi-Fi, ZigBee,
    Z-Wave,

    Bluetooth LE, and Thread [121].

    Security and privacy are also important to consider because smart grid technology

    can be a target for cyber attacks [120]. There are so many IoT objects that can
    be used in

    homes, and the dynamic and heterogeneous nature of smart home environments presents

    a challenge when it comes to addressing authentication and privacy issues [52].
    Cyber

    attackers could target items such as smart home routers, gateways, or any other
    IoT-

    enabled devices to access data [122]. Many strategies are currently being analyzed
    in order

    to address smart home security needs. Blockchain is becoming increasingly utilized
    because

    of its beneﬁts of having a decentralized database based on cryptographic techniques
    [55]).

    Although blockchain approaches have beneﬁted from decentralized security/privacy,
    there

    are drawbacks when it comes to the energy and computational overhead that make
    it not

    ideal for IoT devices that are resource-constrained [123].

    2.4. Smart Cities

    Internet of Things devices have many useful applications when it comes to smart
    cities.

    A smart city can be understood as a city that is equipped with technology, such
    as wireless

    sensor networks and actuators that collect data; it is used to make important
    decisions in

    Sensors 2023, 23, 7194

    8 of 19

    city operations [124]. These systems are inherently complex due to the large number
    of

    devices, link layer technologies, and the different services involved in the operation
    of smart

    city technology [125]. The smart city concept consists of sensing networks, heterogeneous

    infrastructure, and information processing systems working together in order to
    improve

    a variety of areas within cities [126]. The use of IoT technology to enable smart
    cities is

    useful due to the quality of life it provides for the citizens within those cities
    [127]. The

    goal of smart cities is to use all of the information that is collected from IoT
    devices in

    order to improve the performances of urban services to citizens and also consider
    resource

    consumption at the same time [128].

    Trafﬁc monitoring is a very important application within the realm of smart cities.
    It is

    very common for metropolitan areas to be highly populated, and this causes congestion

    problems within these cities. Smart cities make use of information communication
    technolo-

    gies in order to use the information to make decisions on how to dynamically handle
    trafﬁc

    ﬂow [129]. A smart trafﬁc system (STS) involves real-time data collection and
    requires

    IoT devices to quickly obtain real-time public trafﬁc data and have it processed
    [130]. The

    sensors used in smart trafﬁc management systems can be embedded into roads in
    order

    to detect vehicles every 500 or 1000 meters [131]. Cameras are able to apply digital
    image

    processing techniques and, consequently, apply algorithms to aid in the prediction
    of trafﬁc

    density; this information is then used accordingly [132]. Aside from helping trafﬁc
    ﬂow,

    smart trafﬁc management systems also help with improving air quality and providing

    safety for the elderly [133].

    Research indicates that the amount of solid waste will reach around 3.4 billion
    tons

    by the year 2050, and that will put a tremendous strain on municipal waste management

    systems [134]. Smart waste management is another growing application of IoT technology

    in smart cities. Nowadays, waste management systems are overtaxed and burdened
    due

    to the large demands of highly-populated urban areas [135]. The goal of smart
    waste

    management is to use IoT devices in order to optimize waste collection and reduce
    the

    negative impact on the environment [136]. Major factors driving the need for smart
    waste

    management include the demand for energy-efﬁcient processes and the goal of creating

    healthier environments within cities [137]. A number of different objects can
    be repurposed

    into IoT devices, such as trash and recycling containers [138], and different
    technologies

    can be used to indicate when it is time to service a full container. In addition
    to detecting

    when waste bins are full, some sensors are capable of detecting unpleasant smells
    using gas

    sensors [139]. These smart containers essentially work by having sensors in the
    containers

    that read, collect, and communicate information about the amount of trash/recycle
    volume

    within them in order to better understand when it is time to empty the container
    [140].

    In environmental sector applications, IoT technology has emerged as a valuable
    tool in

    enhancing air quality prediction through edge-based computation. Leveraging edge-based

    computation, IoT devices equipped with sensors collect real-time air quality data
    at the

    source, enabling precise prediction models tailored to speciﬁc locations. This
    empowers

    environmental monitoring systems to deliver accurate and timely information for
    effective

    decision-making and pollution control measures.

    In the realm of anomaly detection and classiﬁcation, IoT devices continuously
    monitor

    and analyze data from diverse sources, swiftly identify deviations from normal
    patterns,

    and recognize potential threats or irregularities. Through advanced machine learning
    algo-

    rithms and localized data processing, IoT systems can rapidly detect anomalies,
    ensuring

    the robust security and integrity of IoT networks and the data they generate.

    Moreover, multisensory data fusion in multi-application wireless sensor data streams

    2.5. Industry 4.0

    The manufacturing sector is undergoing a revolutionary transformation with the

    advent of Industry 4.0, ushering in an era of intelligent and interconnected systems.
    A

    prominent trend in this domain is the rapid adoption of Industrial Internet of
    Things (IIoT)

    devices and sensors [141–145] as shown in Figure 7. These embedded devices empower

    machines, equipment, and products to gather and transmit real-time data. The data
    gener-

    ated by IIoT devices are invaluable for predictive maintenance, enabling manufacturers
    to

    proactively identify and address potential equipment failures, thereby reducing
    downtime

    and enhancing operational efﬁciency.

    Figure 7. Industry 4.0.

    Another signiﬁcant trend within Industry 4.0 is the heightened focus on cybersecurity.

    As factories and supply chains become increasingly interconnected and reliant
    on digital

    technologies, the need for robust cybersecurity measures has become paramount.
    Manu-

    facturers are making substantial investments in advanced security solutions to
    safeguard

    sensitive industrial data from cyber threats, ensuring the integrity and availability
    of their

    systems. This includes implementing encryption techniques, authentication protocols,
    and

    intrusion detection systems to fortify critical information.

    Artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are also playing crucial
    roles in

    driving Industry 4.0 forward. With the copious amounts of data generated by IIoT
    devices,

    AI and ML algorithms have the capacity to analyze and derive meaningful insights
    from

    vast datasets. Manufacturers are leveraging these technologies to optimize production

    processes, enhance quality control, and improve decision-making. By detecting
    patterns

    and anomalies in real-time data, AI-powered systems can optimize manufacturing
    opera-

    tions, identify defects, and propose process improvements, ultimately resulting
    in increased

    productivity and reduced costs.

    Furthermore, the adoption of cloud computing technologies has empowered manufac-

    turers to securely store and access vast quantities of data in a ﬂexible and scalable
    manner.

    Cloud-based platforms provide the agility required for data analysis, collaboration,
    and re-

    mote monitoring. Manufacturers can conveniently access real-time production information

    from anywhere, enabling remote troubleshooting, predictive maintenance, and streamlined

    supply chain management.

    Collaborative robots, also known as cobots, represent another noteworthy trend
    in

    Industry 4.0. These robots work alongside human operators, assisting them in various
    tasks

    and augmenting productivity. Cobots, which are designed to be safe, adaptable,
    and easily

    programmable, can adapt to changing production requirements. They are adept at
    handling

    repetitive and physically demanding tasks, freeing up human workers to concentrate
    on

    more intricate and creative aspects of the manufacturing process.

    Sensors 2023, 23, 7194

    10 of 19

    The integration of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technologies
    is also

    gaining momentum within Industry 4.0. These immersive technologies offer interactive

    and intuitive interfaces for training, simulation, and maintenance purposes. VR
    and AR

    enable workers to visualize and manipulate virtual representations of machinery,
    products,

    and processes, thereby enhancing training effectiveness and reducing errors.

    Industry 4.0 is driving a transformative shift in the manufacturing landscape.
    The

    widespread adoption of IIoT devices, AI and ML algorithms, cloud computing, cyberse-

    curity measures, cobots, and immersive technologies is reshaping traditional industrial

    processes into highly connected, intelligent, and efﬁcient operations. Manufacturers
    who

    embrace these trends are poised to reap numerous beneﬁts, including improved produc-

    tivity, cost reductions, enhanced product quality, and increased agility in an
    intensely

    competitive global marketplace.

    3. Challenges and Active Research Topics

    3.1. Security of IoT Devices

    The use of Internet of Things devices is progressively becoming more prevalent
    in

    the daily lives of people around the world; however, cyberattacks remain a large
    threat to

    the safe use of IoT [146]. Different examples of these devices are mobile phones,
    alarms,

    medical sensors, smartwatches, security systems, and more. The use of these devices

    continues to expand, and the need for strong security is vital to their success.
    Although

    these devices bring convenience, they come with many security issues and vulnerabilities.

    Since IoT devices often collect sensitive data, these data transmissions can be
    intercepted by

    third parties who intend to conduct harm or use these data for nefarious purposes.
    In one

    case, there were even attacks that could target IoT devices, such as the Mirai
    malware [147],

    which would hack/convert devices into its botnet and carry out DDoS attacks [148]
    as

    shown in Figure 8. Malware, such as the Mirai and others, take advantage of the
    vast

    amounts of poorly protected IoT devices, which commonly suffer from poor conﬁgurations

    and open designs, making them targets [149]. Detecting malware and IoT botnets
    remains

    an active research area, and many techniques are being applied. The use of a lightweight

    approach in the classiﬁcation of IoT malware through the use of image recognition
    is just

    one example [150]. Other ways include the use of machine learning algorithms that
    use

    supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning in order to handle tasks
    such as

    authentication, access control, and malware detection [151].

    Figure 8. DDoS attacks worldwide.

    Sensors 2023, 23, 7194

    11 of 19

    There is an enormous amount of data being transmitted on a daily basis, which

    impacts critical operations across many applications. It could be possible for
    attackers

    to disrupt entire networks that rely on IoT technology, and the consequences would
    be

    devastating [152]. Hackers and criminals could seriously impact the expansion
    of IoT

    devices in the future, and it is crucial that security be thoroughly researched
    to mitigate

    these negative impacts.

    3.2. Authentication and Password Security

    One security issue is the lack of security in regard to authentication and passwords.

    Many IoT devices rely on password security in order to stay protected from cyber
    criminals

    who are attempting to gain access to them. These passwords can often be weak,
    and

    criminals can have easy access to IoT devices. There is a lack of standardization
    revolving

    around how complex passwords should be. Research shows that having more complex

    password combinations in IoT devices can prevent more cyber attacks [153]. Even
    with

    stronger passwords, there would need to be additional security measures to prevent

    cyber attackers.

    One example of an additional layer of security involves the use of multi-authentication

    in IoT devices. In order to authorize the correct users to access IoT devices,
    it is a prerequisite

    to ﬁrst have authentication [154]. Authentication is the process by which the
    identity of

    users is veriﬁed before allowing them to gain access to a system. Passwords represent

    just one level of authentication, and it is important to understand the other
    types of

    authentication mechanisms that IoT devices can take advantage of. Different methods,

    such as the utilization of elliptic curve cryptography, can be useful when performing

    authentications in IoT security systems [155].

    One-time passwords can sometimes be useful for authentication purposes related
    to

    IoT devices. These passwords work by having a private key generator (PKG) generate
    a

    one-time password, and this password is used as a private key that is needed in
    order to

    gain access. The last phase of using one-time passwords involves validation. In
    this phase,

    the application and IoT device exchange data via a one-time password, verifying
    that the

    password was sourced from a valid location [56].

    3.3. Interoperability Challenges

    Using IoT devices smoothly and without compatibility issues remains a challenge

    both now and in the future. Interoperability is important because it allows IoT
    devices

    to communicate with each other more efﬁciently. It is a challenge to have IoT
    devices

    work together seamlessly because many operate on different infrastructures, devices,

    APIs, and even data formats [156]. The need for the safe interoperability of IoT
    devices

    has even led to the creation of international organizations that develop standards
    that

    IoT devices can adopt with the intention of becoming more compatible [157]. The
    use

    of protocols and standards, such as Bluetooth and ZigBee, is critical to the rise
    of IoT

    technology because it essentially establishes the rules for use and communication,
    helping

    to address interoperability concerns [158]. International organizations, such
    as IEEE, the

    Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), OneM2M, and others, have developed important

    standards and protocols and play integral roles in inﬂuencing the IoT [159]. One
    important

    contribution to addressing these challenges is the BiG IoT project, which is an
    initiative that

    seeks to create a common API that different IoT devices could communicate through
    [160].

    3.4. Cloud Computing Research

    Since IoT devices generate massive amounts of data, cloud computing solutions
    are

    continually being used and researched in order to better handle these data demands.

    Cloud IoT is a novel IT paradigm that represents the merging of the cloud with
    IoT,

    and research in this area will be crucial in moving this technology forward [161].
    Cloud

    computing is essentially an extension of distributed computing, parallel computing,
    and

    grid computing [126]. There are many IoT constraints that cloud computing addresses,

    Sensors 2023, 23, 7194

    12 of 19

    such as processing, storage, and communication [162]. For example, a major concern
    about

    IoT data involves the security risks that come from storing data locally on IoT
    devices [163],

    and cloud computing aims to address this concern by allowing data storage in cloud

    computing servers [164]. Since data collected from IoT devices are often unstructured,

    cloud computing research looks to improve the real-time data processing capabilities
    and

    allow for more dynamic resource management [165].

    3.5. Potential Future Directions and Developments

    The potential future directions and developments of IoT in healthcare, agriculture,

    smart homes, smart cities, and Industry 4.0 are poised to bring about transformative

    changes and advancements. In healthcare, the integration of IoT with telemedicine,
    wear-

    able health technology, and advanced data analytics holds promise for revolutionizing

    patient care. Real-time monitoring, personalized treatment plans, and early disease
    detec-

    tion can be facilitated through IoT-enabled devices, leading to improved health
    outcomes.

    In agriculture, IoT-driven precision farming techniques, such as smart irrigation
    and crop

    disease detection, have the potential to optimize resource utilization, conserve
    water, and

    enhance crop yield. By leveraging real-time data from IoT sensors, farmers can
    make

    informed decisions and implement timely interventions. In the realm of smart homes,

    the focus will be on seamless integration, energy efﬁciency, and personalized
    automation.

    IoT-enabled smart home solutions will allow for centralized control and management
    of

    various devices, optimizing energy consumption and providing tailored experiences
    for

    inhabitants. In smart cities, IoT applications will enhance transportation systems,
    envi-

    ronmental monitoring, and citizen engagement. Intelligent trafﬁc management, real-time

    tracking of air quality, and participatory governance will contribute to improved
    mobility,

    sustainability, and quality of life. Finally, Industry 4.0 will witness the integration
    of IoT in

    industrial automation, predictive maintenance, and supply chain optimization.
    IoT-driven

    technologies will enable the real-time monitoring of machines, predictive maintenance

    strategies, and streamlined logistics, leading to enhanced productivity and reduced
    down-

    time. Continued research and development in these areas will shape the future
    of IoT,

    paving the way for innovative solutions and transformative advancements across
    sectors.

  explanation: 'The proposed architecture integrates AI, blockchain, and a 6G network
    to enhance the security and privacy of sensitive crime data in public safety applications.
    An attacker may attempt to manipulate criminal activity information systems to
    avoid legal action; therefore, the proposed architecture offers a secure pipeline
    to protect public safety applications from nefarious offense.


    The real-time collected criminal activity dataset is preprocessed and classified
    into attack and nonattack categories. The classiﬁed data is sensitive to security
    threats and requires immutable and secure storage. For that, the classiﬁed data
    is stored in the IPFS-based blockchain network using smart contracts. The authorized
    users, such as employees from the ﬁre department, hospital, and police, access
    the data securely.'

    \ have rapidly grown over the past few decades to offer futuristic ap-\nplications,\
    \ such as autonomous vehicles, smart farming, and smart city. Such applications\
    \ require\nubiquitous, real-time, and secure communications to deliver services\
    \ quickly. Toward this aim,\nsixth-generation (6G) wireless technology offers\
    \ superior performance with high reliability, enhanced\ntransmission rate, and\
    \ low latency. However, managing the resources of the aforementioned applica-\n\
    tions is highly complex in the precarious network. An adversary can perform various\
    \ network-related\nattacks (i.e., data injection or modiﬁcation) to jeopardize\
    \ the regular operation of the smart applica-\ntions. Therefore, incorporating\
    \ blockchain technology in the smart application can be a prominent\nsolution\
    \ to tackle security, reliability, and data-sharing privacy concerns. Motivated\
    \ by the same,\nwe presented a case study on public safety applications that utilizes\
    \ the essential characteristics of\nartiﬁcial intelligence (AI), blockchain, and\
    \ a 6G network to handle data integrity attacks on the crime\ndata. The case study\
    \ is assessed using various performance parameters by considering blockchain\n\
    scalability, packet drop ratio, and training accuracy. Lastly, we explored different\
    \ research challenges\nof adopting blockchain in the 6G wireless network.\nKeywords:\
    \ blockchain; 6G network; applications; blockchain services; unmanned aerial vehicle;\
    \ AI\n1. Introduction\nIn the current scenario, humans interact with the physical\
    \ world using sixth-generation\n(6G)-based technologies, such as the Internet\
    \ of things (IoT), cloud computing, big data,\nand artiﬁcial intelligence (AI).\
    \ These technologies monitor the application’s resources and\ncontrol a colossal\
    \ amount of data, power, and storage resources. The advent of IoT technolo-\n\
    gies brings tremendous cognizant applications, such as smart healthcare, smart\
    \ cities, smart\ngrids, etc., to improve people’s standard of living. However,\
    \ the increasing number of\nusers and their network demands, such as high bandwidth\
    \ and low latency, make wireless\ncommunication networks more complex and vulnerable\
    \ to different security and privacy\nissues, such as user identity, authenticity,\
    \ data integrity, information security, and conﬁden-\ntiality [1]. For example,\
    \ in a smart healthcare system, the patient health record is private\nSensors\
    \ 2023, 23, 969. https://doi.org/10.3390/s23020969\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\n\
    Sensors 2023, 23, 969\n2 of 26\nand sensitive information that must be secured\
    \ from adversaries, which can misuse this\ninformation by tampering with it or\
    \ selling it to the black market. Another example is\nfor public safety applications\
    \ (e.g., IoT-based crime detection), where a criminal tries to\nmodify the central\
    \ repository that holds the criminal records. The adversary can modify or\ntamper\
    \ the criminal records, i.e., it can perform injection attacks to change the criminal’s\n\
    identity (e.g., remove the traces of criminal evidence). Therefore, superior technology\n\
    such as blockchain is required to overcome the aforementioned security issues\
    \ in 6G-based\nsmart applications [2]. It strengthens the security and privacy\
    \ of wireless communication\nnetworks by utilizing its essential characteristics,\
    \ i.e., immutability, scalability, security and\nprivacy, transparency, and decentralization\
    \ [3,4].\nBlockchain is a decentralized ledger technology that builds trust between\
    \ various\nnetwork services and applications such as smart grids, smart agriculture,\
    \ smart cities,\nunmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications, and vehicle-to-vehicle\
    \ (V2V) communica-\ntions. It also delivers improved services such as interoperability,\
    \ distribution, immutability,\nfaster settlement, unanimity, and many more. As\
    \ a result, blockchain is associated with a\n6G-based wireless communication network\
    \ and offers a secure and trusted environment for\ndata protection in an IoT-based\
    \ public safety environment. For example, Velliangiri et al. [5]\ndiscussed the\
    \ applicability of blockchain technology with the emerging 6G network for\nsecure\
    \ data sharing. They proposed a privacy-preserving architecture for industrial\
    \ services\nand applications. Then, Bindu et al. [6] discussed the signiﬁcance\
    \ of blockchain in 6G\nwireless communication networks. They studied various applications\
    \ of 6G with security\nand privacy threats and explored blockchain-based solutions\
    \ for smart and industrial IoT-\nbased applications. In [7], the authors used\
    \ blockchain secure storage to store crime images\nby applying watermarking and\
    \ cryptographic blockchain in forensic applications. There\nhas been a lot of\
    \ research work in the ﬁeld of the integration of blockchain in 6G-based\nreal-world\
    \ applications. A detailed explanation of each application is as follows.\n1.1.\
    \ Applications of Blockchain in 6G Network\nThis section presents the role of\
    \ blockchain in 6G-based smart applications such as\nsmart cities, smart manufacturing,\
    \ smart agriculture, V2V communication, UAV communi-\ncations, and smart grid\

    \ an essential sector in the nation’s economic system that\noffers medical services\
    \ to treat patients, promote patients’ health, and increase the quality\nof life\
    \ of individuals. The emerging 6G technology revolutionizes healthcare by changing\n\
    the perception of lifestyle [8]. A smart healthcare system offers better connectivity\
    \ between\npatients and healthcare providers, medical organizations, and IoT-based\
    \ medical devices. It\nprovides a health information platform by adopting 6G-based\
    \ services, such as augmented\nand virtual reality. In addition, healthcare systems\
    \ require the blockchain to securely store\nmedical records and update patient\
    \ data across different platforms in real-time [9,10].\nResearchers enabled blockchain\
    \ technology in 6G-based applications and proposed\nmany solutions for smart healthcare.\
    \ For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, patients\nsuffering from chronic\
    \ diseases are more at risk than ordinary people because patients with\ndiabetes\
    \ and asthma are more susceptible to coronavirus infection. Therefore, there is\
    \ a\nrequirement to treat these types of patients remotely and offer them emergency\
    \ facilities\nsuch as temperature checks, pulse, and respiratory and O2 monitoring.\
    \ However, remote\ndiagnosis and treatment can be lured by the attacker and cause\
    \ patient data security issues.\nThus, to overcome these issues, blockchain is\
    \ integrated with a healthcare system that\nremotely monitors the health data\
    \ of patients suffering from a chronic disease. In [11],\nthe authors facilitated\
    \ a private blockchain and a solidity-based smart contract that keeps\ntrack of\
    \ patients’ health information. The role of blockchain in their proposed work\
    \ is to\nsecurely analyze patients’ details and store patient health records from\
    \ and to the sensors.\nFurther, in [12], the authors investigated AI with healthcare\
    \ systems and proposed a\nparallel gout diagnosis and treatment system (PGDTS).\
    \ Their proposed system enhances\nthe diagnosis accuracy and the effectiveness\
    \ of medical treatment. After the diagnosis and\ntreatment process, their adopted\
    \ scheme was analyzed and evaluated based on diverse\ntherapeutic regimens, and\
    \ they established parallel execution for real-time optimization of\nhealthcare\
    \ processes. Their integrated blockchain-based PGDTS scheme offers integrity,\n\
    scalability, and security of patients’ data.\n1.1.2. Smart Manufacturing\nIn the\
    \ real-world scenario, massive amounts of data are exchanged between the\ndevices\
    \ for large-scale manufacturing. Therefore, machines have the interaction capability\n\
    to cooperate via the Industrial Internet in the manufacturing industry. In order\
    \ to improve\nthe performance of the entire manufacturing process, machines autonomously\
    \ make local\ndecisions [13]; however, there is a requirement for always-on connectivity,\
    \ a higher data\nrate, more reliability, and ultra-low latency in the manufacturing\
    \ industry. The 6G mobile\ncommunication techniques are developed to target the\
    \ aforementioned manufacturing\nindustrial services; however, there are security\
    \ issues in the manufacturing industry where\na malicious user could tamper with\
    \ the manufacturing data. Therefore, blockchain-based\nnetworks are integrated\
    \ into manufacturing systems that offer cybersecurity guarantees\nvia smart contracts,\
    \ hash functions, digital signatures, and immutable digital ledgers to\ntackle\
    \ security and privacy issues. Recently, Leng et al. [14] incorporated digital\
    \ twins with\ndecentralized permissioned blockchain networks to build better mutual\
    \ trust and data ﬂow\nin manufacturing processes. They proposed a ManuChain prototype\
    \ to realize lower- and\nupper-level intelligence for crowd self-organize and\
    \ holistic optimization. Their proposed\nscheme aided a new value for transforming\
    \ and upgrading manufacturing systems. It also\nenhanced the efﬁciency of the\
    \ manufacturing process.\nRecently, blockchain has been investigated and integrated\
    \ with mobile edge com-\nputing (MEC) to overcome the computational workload.\
    \ It reduces time complexity and\nsigniﬁcantly improves system performance. In\
    \ [15], the authors presented a smart man-\nufacturing system by integrating MEC\
    \ with blockchain technology. They also proposed\na swarm-intelligence-based optimization\
    \ model with numerous tasks that enhance the\nprocessing time. Blockchain offers\
    \ device-level information transmission and manufac-\nturing service transactions\
    \ in their proposed approach. Then, Teng et al. [16] proposed a\nSensors 2023,\
    \ 23, 969\n4 of 26\nsmart manufacturing scheme using distributed ledger technology\
    \ that supports on-demand\nproduction. They introduced a blockchain-embedded smart\
    \ manufacturing system that en-\nhances manufacturing efﬁciency. They investigated\
    \ latency and limited throughput issues\nin the blockchain network. Therefore,\
    \ they proposed a deep Q-network that maximizes\nthe user’s net proﬁt. Their results\
    \ show that their proposed framework is highly scalable.\nIt offers consistency,\
    \ availability, and privacy by incorporating off-chain storage, ledger\nisolation,\
    \ and encryption mechanism.\n1.1.3. Smart City\nSmart city architecture requires\
    \ conventional internet support for information collec-\ntion and transmission;\
    \ however, the transmitted data encounter latency and security issues\ndue to\
    \ the precarious communication link between nodes of the smart city. Therefore,\n\
    6G communication technology plays an essential role in connecting devices such\
    \ as the\nsensor in the IoT environment. However, these devices face authentication\
    \ issues that affect\ncomputational costs, communication overheads, and robustness\
    \ [17]. To mitigate these is-\nsues, blockchain technology offers conﬁdentiality,\
    \ integrity, and availability in IoT-enabled\nsmart devices.\nSeveral researchers\
    \ discussed the security challenges in a smart city context. In [18],\nthe author\
    \ aimed to enhance the data collection and processing in smart city governance.\n\
    Therefore, they introduced a hybrid consortium blockchain framework that encourages\n\
    public engagement in the decision-making process. The proposed approach can tackle\n\
    the collusion attacks from the public veriﬁer’s group. Further, they offered a\
    \ Stackelberg-\ngame-based approach to enable persistent public participation\
    \ in the transaction validation\nprocess. The work in [19] proposed an IoT–fog–cloud\
    \ integrated approach with the inter-\nplanetary ﬁle system (IPFS)-based blockchain\
    \ for IoT-driven smart cities. They presented a\nsecure framework based on two-level\
    \ privacy and an intrusion detection scheme. The ﬁrst\nscheme incorporated a blockchain\
    \ module to secure the IoT information and proposed a\ndimensionality reduction\
    \ technique that transits raw IoT data in a new shape. They applied\na gradient\
    \ boosting anomaly detector approach for intrusion detection. Their results show\n\
    that their adopted scheme outperforms in terms of accuracy, recall, F1-score,\
    \ and precision\ncompared with the conventional intrusion detection scheme. Further,\
    \ Rahman et al. [20]\nincorporated blockchain with the IoT infrastructure and\
    \ proposed an MEC-enabled sharing\neconomy system for mega smart cities. They\
    \ utilized smart contracts for decentralized\nmessaging services and stored IoT\
    \ data in a decentralized repository via edge networks.\n1.1.4. Smart Vehicles\n\
    To establish V2V communication, vehicles must quickly send the vehicular informa-\n\
    tion, comprising number of pedestrians, road conditions, number of vehicles, and\
    \ their\nconditions, to reduce the number of road accidents and enhance road safety.\
    \ However,\nthe scalability of V2V communication increases the security, safety,\
    \ reliability, and trust\nissues of vehicular network users. Therefore, there\
    \ is a requirement for a prominent solu-\ntion to overcome these issues. Blockchain\
    \ is used to manage the ground truth of vehicle\ninformation and offers data authentication\
    \ among vehicles. Many researchers recently\nfocused on blockchain technology\
    \ for V2V communication. Chattaraj et al. [21] integrated\nblockchain with IoT-driven\
    \ smart devices that improve customer safety, ease congestion,\nand pollution\
    \ reduction. For that, they proposed a certiﬁcateless key agreement protocol for\n\
    Internet of vehicles in a smart transportation context (Block-CLAP). The proposed\
    \ scheme\noutperforms the precedent authentication schemes’ security, communication,\
    \ and computa-\ntional overheads.\nFurthermore, Xia et al. [22] integrated blockchain\
    \ with the Internet of vehicles (BIoV)\nand proposed a novel V2V electricity trading\
    \ approach using Bayesian game pricing. They\nutilized a Bayesian game that predicted\
    \ the price in the distributed BIoV with incomplete\ninformation-sharing. In the\
    \ pricing game approach, they applied smart contracts that\nprovide security,\
    \ trust, and reliability for electricity transactions. The results reveal that\
    \ the\nSensors 2023, 23, 969\n5 of 26\nproposed scheme reduces communication overhead\
    \ and time complexity in the decentral-\nized IoVs compared to the static game.\
    \ Then, in [23], the authors incorporated a blockchain\nnetwork with the vehicles\
    \ that stores real-time information about vehicles, such as relaying,\ntransmitting,\
    \ and receiving data. As a result, the adopted scheme is able to block malicious\n\
    or unauthorized vehicles from participation. Finally, they considered network\
    \ parameters,\nsuch as throughput and error rate analysis (i.e., bit error rate)\
    \ to evaluate their proposed\nscheme. They proved the proposed scheme’s efﬁciency\
    \ and effectiveness by enhancing\nthroughput by 3 bps and decreasing BER by 2\
    \ dB.\n1.1.5. Smart Grid\nA smart grid is introduced to meet people’s higher electricity\
    \ needs and optimize\nresource allocation. The smart grid makes better decisions\
    \ about power and energy-sharing\ndata. It supports management approaches for\
    \ peak energy demand and also reduces energy\nconsumption by exchanging the data\
    \ of energy feedback and power consumption [24].\nHowever, due to the possibility\
    \ of malicious access during information exchange over the\ninsecure communication\
    \ network, multiple entities are unwilling to convey their informa-\ntion to protect\
    \ their data privacy. Moreover, there are various types of cyberattacks in smart\n\
    grid systems, such as session hijacking, nonrepudiation, denial-of-service (DoS),\
    \ ﬂooding,\nspooﬁng, and man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attack [25]. To overcome the\
    \ security and privacy\nissues, smart technology is required that provides trust,\
    \ reliability, and data-sharing secu-\nrity. Many researchers adopt blockchain\
    \ as a solution to secure the smart grid. For instance,\nthe authors of [26] presented\
    \ a secure and reliable data exchange scheme by utilizing\nthe processing mode.\
    \ The proposed scheme provides transparency and auditability of\nenergy production,\
    \ pricing, and services in smart grids. They utilized smart contracts to\nauthenticate\
    \ and track the data ﬂow between different blockchain members. Additionally,\n\
    they incorporated a distributed ledger that provides an immutable and transparent\
    \ data\nusage record. As a result, their adopted scheme outperforms in terms of\
    \ payoffs compared\nwith baseline works. Further, Hao et al. [27] focused on the\
    \ efﬁciency and privacy issue in\nthe current electricity trading scheme. Therefore,\
    \ they analyzed a decentralized scheme of\npeer-to-peer electricity trading by\
    \ introducing smart meters. They utilized a blockchain\nwallet for transactions\
    \ and a smart contract to initiate the transmission switch instructions.\nThe\
    \ results revealed that the proposed scheme reduces the cost and latency. Furthermore,\n\
    they offered fast and privacy-aware roaming to prove the proposed scheme’s feasibility\n\
    and efﬁciency.\n1.1.6. Smart Agriculture\nIn the world, agriculture is the largest\
    \ sector of economic activity. With an increasing\nworld population, there is\
    \ a requirement to increase agricultural productivity by adopt-\ning smart technologies,\
    \ such as IoT, robotics, UAV communication, AI, etc., to enhance\nthe quality\
    \ and quantity of agricultural products with minimum human labor. Existing\nwireless\
    \ standards such as ZigBee, Bluetooth, Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi), Narrowband IoT\n\
    (NB-IoT), and WiMAX are used for pesticide detection, soil sensing, smart irrigation,\
    \ crop\nrecommendations, and plant protection. They prevent forest ﬁres and offer\
    \ safety to crops\nfrom pests [28]. However, the aforementioned technologies face\
    \ an issue when a consid-\nerable amount of agricultural data is accumulated in\
    \ real-time. In addition, population\ngrowth and environmental effects such as\
    \ climate change, temperature, rainfall, etc., af-\nfect the agriculture system.\
    \ Therefore, emerging 6G wireless communication technology\nand its speciﬁc application\
    \ scenarios are introduced in agriculture, providing intelligent,\nunmanned, and\
    \ automatic agricultural production and cultivation by offering high-speed\nconnectivity\
    \ between smart devices.\nSmart agriculture systems require transparency and commercial\
    \ security for the food\ndata [29]. Therefore, many researchers adopt blockchain\
    \ technology in the agricultural ﬁeld\nto provide security, reliability, transparency,\
    \ and privacy of agricultural data. For example,\nVangala et al. [30] proposed\
    \ a blockchain-based smart contract that includes a key agree-\nSensors 2023,\
    \ 23, 969\n6 of 26\nment approach to mitigate the risk of data integrity attacks\
    \ in smart farming systems. Their\nproposed scheme utilizes a robust authentication\
    \ method between two IoT devices. Simi-\nlarly, another authentication phase is\
    \ utilized between an IoT device and the gateway node\nto offer endogenous security.\
    \ Furthermore, they proposed a hybrid blockchain to store the\ntrading transactions\
    \ between different components of the agriculture ecosystem, pesticide\nusage,\
    \ and quality and quantity of fertilizers. The results revealed that the adopted\
    \ scheme\noutperforms in terms of computational time compared to the existing\
    \ authentication proto-\ncols. Then, Yang et al. [31] focused on centralized,\
    \ opaque, and untrustworthy data storage\nissues for horticulture products. To\
    \ overcome the aforementioned issues, they introduced\na traceability system (e.g.,\
    \ on- and off-chain traceability) using a dual storage within the\nblockchain.\
    \ They utilized cryptography-based elliptic curves with blockchain for safe data\n\
    sharing. Moreover, they proposed a reputation-based smart contract to upload traceability\n\
    information from the node. Their simulation results enhance efﬁciency and guarantee\
    \ the\nagriculture data’s reliability, security, and authenticity.\nNevertheless,\
    \ the aforesaid applications require superlative care from criminal activi-\n\
    ties, natural calamities (e.g., ﬁre, earthquake, etc.), terrorist attacks, and\
    \ riots. For example,\nif a person driving a smart vehicle meets with a road accident,\
    \ it can use V2V communica-\ntion to share this information with the emergency\
    \ medical response team. Similarly, UAV\ncommunication can assist V2V communication\
    \ in sharing this information with nearby hos-\npitals to provide emergency medical\
    \ care. Another scenario is where smart manufacturing\nrequires on-site maintenance\
    \ to clean and repair various critical equipment of the manu-\nfacturing organization.\
    \ This is challenging for a person to perform on-site maintenance\nbecause the\
    \ manufacturing vessels and equipment are highly hazardous (i.e., radioactive)\n\
    to human health. Further, a criminal attempt to commit a crime (e.g., stealing,\
    \ murder,\nkidnapping, etc.) in the smart city must be captured under the jurisdiction.\
    \ Therefore,\nthe government and local organizations must offer an emergency response,\
    \ disaster risk\nmanagement, and criminal investigation teams under the umbrella\
    \ of public safety applica-\ntions to protect the wellbeing of the nation’s citizens\
    \ who are using the abovementioned\napplications. However, it is observed from\
    \ the literature review that public safety applica-\ntions are highly insecure\
    \ from the perspective of security and privacy. These applications\nstill use\
    \ legacy software and tools and utilize a centralized repository for data storage\
    \ that\nthe attackers can lure. Moreover, as these applications are mission-critical,\
    \ they require\nlow latency and high data rate communication to offer proactive\
    \ services; however, many\npublic safety applications still use traditional network\
    \ interfaces (e.g., 3G and 4G) that\ndegrade their performance.\n1.2. Motivation\n\
    The motivation behind this work is given as follows.\n•\nMost of the existing\
    \ literature focuses on the role of blockchain in 6G-based appli-\ncations; however,\
    \ there are a few research articles available in which the authors\nstudied the\
    \ drivers, enablers, security requirements, and applicability of blockchain in\n\
    6G-based smart applications.\n•\nFrom the literature review, we observed that\
    \ no comprehensive work exists that\nconsiders the security and privacy challenges\
    \ of IoT-based public safety applications\nusing blockchain technology.\n•\nThus,\
    \ there is a stringent requirement to provide exhaustive work on the applicability\n\
    of blockchain in IoT-based public safety applications underlying a 6G network.\n\
    1.3. Research Contributions\nThis article presents the role of the blockchain\
    \ in a 6G-based IoT-enabled public safety\napplication. We also emphasize how\
    \ blockchain provides security and privacy in 6G\nservices. Moreover, the paper\
    \ shows the amalgamation of blockchain in 6G communication\nnetworks to strengthen\
    \ the security and communication of public safety applications. Based\non that,\
    \ the following are the signiﬁcant contributions of this research article.\nSensors\
    \ 2023, 23, 969\n7 of 26\n•\nThrough this article, we propose a detailed work\
    \ on the applicability of blockchain\nin a 6G network. We also analyze the 6G-based\
    \ smart applications and discuss how\nblockchain features provide trust, security,\
    \ authenticity, conﬁdentiality, and privacy.\n•\nWe explore different 6G-network-based\
    \ services and discuss the inﬂuence of blockchain\nin delivering 6G-based services\
    \ to various smart applications.\n•\nWe consider a blockchain- and 6G-based case\
    \ study for public safety applications to\nshowcase the adoption of blockchain\
    \ technology in the 6G network interface. Further,\nthe case study is assessed\
    \ by considering blockchain scalability, 6G latency, and AI\nstatistical measures\
    \ parameters.\n•\nLastly, we perform an in-depth analysis and identify the research\
    \ challenges of the\nadoption of blockchain in the 6G network to motivate the\
    \ researchers working on the\nsame domain.\n2. Related Works\nIn the previous\
    \ section, we discussed various blockchain-based 6G applications such\nas smart\
    \ healthcare, smart grid, smart agriculture, smart manufacturing, etc. After study-\n\
    ing these real-world applications in detail, we identiﬁed that public safety is\
    \ an essential\ndomain that requires more security attention. Various researchers\
    \ consider public safety\napplications and offered security and privacy approaches\
    \ for road safety, criminal activity\nmonitoring, on-site safety, etc. They deal\
    \ with data security, person authentication, infor-\nmation conﬁdentiality, and\
    \ integrity issues. For example, Ihinosen et al. [32] addressed the\ndynamic ridesharing\
    \ issue in public transport systems. They proposed GPS tracking and a\ntwo-way\
    \ rating system using the mobile application’s facial recognition module.\nIn\
    \ the aforementioned work, the researchers incorporated different security mech-\n\
    anisms using mobile applications and cryptographic primitives. However, they are\
    \ yet\nto consider data consistency, traceability, and scalability. Therefore,\
    \ Xu et al. [33] uti-\nlized various technologies such as blockchain, IoT, edge,\
    \ fog, and cloud computing for\nsmart public safety. They proposed the BLockchain-ENabled\
    \ Decentralized Microservices\nArchitecture for Smart public safety, named BlendMAS,\
    \ scheme that offers security and\ndata access control for the public safety system.\
    \ Then, in [34], Fitwi et al. worked on the\nsafety and security of video surveillance\
    \ systems. They proposed edge computing and a\nsmart-contract-based lightweight\
    \ privacy protection (Lib-Pri) scheme that identiﬁes the\nfugitives using their\
    \ facial features. Makhdoom et al. [35] proposed a smart-contract-based\ncollaborative\
    \ intrusion detection system that prevents cyberattack and data theft. Their\n\
    proposed scheme manages the trust between the nodes and prevents the input false\
    \ attack\nin the IDS.\nFurthermore, Wu et al. [36] focused on the on-site safety\
    \ issue due to the equipment\ndefects and environmental hazards for tower crane\
    \ safety management. They proposed\na blockchain-based framework utilizing Hyperledger\
    \ Fabric that offers security and au-\nthenticity with trust at the construction\
    \ site. Moreover, Yu et al. [37] addressed data\nvulnerability, conﬁdentiality,\
    \ privacy, and the centralized key storage issue of the IIoT data\nstorage applications.\
    \ To overcome this problem, they proposed a Shamir threshold cryp-\ntography scheme\
    \ with blockchain called STCChain that offers availability, accountability,\n\
    and integrity of the data. Then, Na et al. [38] proposed a blockchain-enabled\
    \ access control\nscheme using multisignature that protects autonomous vehicle\
    \ data. They collected and\nstored vehicle data using a dashboard camera and global\
    \ positioning system. Their ﬁndings\nshowed that the proposed scheme offers data\
    \ privacy and security with lower veriﬁcation\ntime and latency. Table 1 shows\
    \ the comparative analysis of existing works for public safety\napplications by\
    \ incorporating security, 6G network with their objective, pros, and cons.\nFrom\
    \ the overall study, we observed that many researchers carried out a lot of research\n\
    work in the security ﬁeld for smart public safety applications. In most papers,\
    \ the research\ncommunity focuses on the role of different security approaches,\
    \ such as cryptographic and\nmobile applications. However, very few of them incorporated\
    \ blockchain-based security in\nSensors 2023, 23, 969\n8 of 26\npublic safety\
    \ applications. Therefore, we included a blockchain-based security approach\n\
    using 6G wireless communication in the public safety application domain.\nTable\

    \ of the research article is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the literature\n\
    review of the state-of-the-art works. Section 3 presents blockchain-based 6G services\
    \ such\nas network slicing, spectrum sharing, data sharing, and resource management.\
    \ In Section 4,\nwe proposed layer-wise architecture for IoT-based public safety\
    \ application. Section 5\ndiscusses the results and analysis of the proposed case\
    \ study. Then, we discuss various\nchallenges of the adoption of blockchain in\
    \ 6G network in Section 6. Finally, Section 7\nprovides the conclusion.\n3. Role\
    \ of Blockchain in 6G Services\nThis section provides insights on the 6G-based\
    \ smart services, such as network slicing,\nspectrum sharing, resource management,\
    \ and data sharing. Table 2 shows the comparative\nstudy on blockchain-based existing\
    \ 6G services.\nSensors 2023, 23, 969\n9 of 26\n3.1. Network Slicing\nNetwork\
    \ slicing allows to create different virtual networks, where each network\nposes\
    \ different network services from the physical networks infrastructure. This is\
    \ made\npossible by integrating technologies, such as software-deﬁned network\
    \ (SDN) and network\nfunctions virtualization (NFV), that divide single network\
    \ connections into multiple distinct\nvirtual connections. It delivers virtual\
    \ applications that are directly deployed on the\nslice for instant service delivery\
    \ to the users. As an outcome, mobile applications that\nare running on slices\
    \ have large-scale connections and low-latency services with a high-\nquality\
    \ user experience. Network slices reduce the network complexity by virtualization\n\
    and add automation to a complex network. However, it faces issues in dynamic slice\n\
    creation, resource sharing, wireless resource virtualization, and data security.\
    \ To mitigate\nthe aforementioned issues, blockchain is integrated with network\
    \ slicing to provide user\ntrust, transparency, and privacy. Many researchers\
    \ integrate blockchain as a service in\nnetwork slicing. For example, Abdulqadder\
    \ et al. [39] focused on user authentication,\nload imbalance, and inappropriate\
    \ network slicing issues in an edge-assisted 6G network.\nInitially, they designed\
    \ a deep-learning-based adversarial network that predicts the efﬁcient\nnetwork\
    \ slices and communication links based on the slice capacity, priority, and quality-of-\n\
    service (QoS) demands for data transmission. Further, they applied DAG-based blockchain\n\
    using the proof-of-space approach to enhance the scalability and overcome more\
    \ resource\nconsumption issues. Moreover, they introduced a soft actor–critic\
    \ scheme for load balancing\nin the SDN controller. Finally, the paper concluded\
    \ that the adopted scheme reduces\nhandover latency, packet loss rate, and data\
    \ transmission delay and enhances the system\nthroughput and different attack\
    \ detection rate.\nHe et al. in [40] integrated a multidomain network slice orchestration\
    \ framework with\na blockchain-based CoNet consensus algorithm for data consistency,\
    \ scalability, and security.\nFurther, they proposed a game-theory-based bilateral\
    \ evaluation approach that provides\nsystem fairness with a QoS guarantee. The\
    \ ﬁndings showed that the adopted scheme\nprovides users’ data security and privacy\
    \ with high throughput and low latency. Then,\nChen et al. [41] formulated a blockchain-based\
    \ optical network slicing scheme for IoT\napplications. They focused on the users’\
    \ data security and trust issues while they utilized\nIoT services. The results\
    \ showed that their presented scheme is able to complete slicing\ntransactions\
    \ with a high-quality dedicated communication network.\n3.2. Spectrum Sharing\n\
    The explosive growth of bandwidth-intensive Internet applications such as live\
    \ audio\nand video streaming, web conferencing, big data processing, etc., requires\
    \ high-speed\nnetwork access with a higher frequency spectrum. The 6G wireless\
    \ technology provides\nhigh-speed network access with ultra-reliable low-latency\
    \ communication (URLLC) using\na higher-frequency spectrum [42]. However, it also\
    \ increases congestion and interference in\nthe communication network. To overcome\
    \ this issue, it is required to share the spectrum\nproperly that enhances communication\
    \ capacity and spectrum efﬁciency. Spectrum sharing\naims to efﬁciently use scarce\
    \ natural resources to ensure fairness between mobile users.\nThere are two types\
    \ of methods for spectrum sharing: static and dynamic spectrum sharing.\nOut of\
    \ these two spectrum-sharing mechanisms, dynamic spectrum sharing is the most\n\
    adopted method; it provides feasible, ﬂexible, and efﬁcient spectrum management\
    \ based on\ncognitive radio technology [43,44]. The variety of spectrum bands\
    \ and the rivalry between\ndifferent mobile network operators are the challenges\
    \ in the 6G spectrum sharing. Af-\nter lots of research, many solutions were proposed\
    \ in [45,46] for efﬁcient spectrum sharing;\nhowever, the solutions that address\
    \ the spectrum scarcity problem face issues such as single\npoint of failure,\
    \ malicious activity from unauthorized users, and security concerns.\nTo mitigate\
    \ the aforementioned issue, many researchers incorporate blockchain with\n6G technology,\
    \ which improves security and system performance [47]. For example,\nLiu et al.\
    \ [48] integrated AI with blockchain for radio spectrum resource allocation in\n\
    6G-based enhanced URLLC service. They focused on resource scheduling, classiﬁcation,\n\
    Sensors 2023, 23, 969\n10 of 26\nand neural network optimization issues between\
    \ IoT devices. For that, they proposed a re-\ninforcement learning approach with\
    \ a blockchain-integrated hybrid cloud. Their presented\nscheme uses uniﬁed coding\
    \ and identiﬁcation standards to build a public management\nplatform to register\
    \ and manage IoT device information. The ﬁndings reveal that the\nadopted scheme\
    \ effectively increases spectrum utilization with security and reliability.\n\
    Further, in [49], the authors presented a blockchain-based user-autonomy spectrum-sharing\n\
    framework that efﬁciently manages the heterogeneous devices of the IoT network.\
    \ They\ndesigned a swarm intelligence approach and a dynamic tip selection algorithm\
    \ to enhance\nthe system and global utility. The simulation results revealed that\
    \ the proposed scheme\nminimizes the average waiting time of transactions and\
    \ power consumption. Moreover, it\nenhances global utility, throughput, and spectral\
    \ efﬁciency. Then, Manogaran et al. [50]\npresented a blockchain-based security\
    \ solution for access control and preserving the data\nprivacy of users’ resources.\
    \ Furthermore, they introduced a Q-learning approach with\nmachine-type communication\
    \ (MTC) that enhanced the performance in the 6G environ-\nment. Compared to the\
    \ existing schemes, their proposed scheme outperformed in terms of\nthe success\
    \ ratio, access time modiﬁcation, time complexity, and memory utilization.\n3.3.\
    \ Data Sharing\nThe 6G-based smart applications such as UAV communication, aerial\
    \ base stations,\nsatellite communication, V2V communication, etc., offer real-time\
    \ data-sharing features\nover the Internet through a mobile communication network.\
    \ Moreover, an increasing\nnumber of social media applications, such as Twitter,\
    \ Facebook, Instagram, etc., and web\nconferencing applications, such as Webex,\
    \ Google Meet, Zoom, etc., require content delivery\nin real-time. These applications\
    \ generate a colossal amount of audio, video, text, and image\ndata. To control\
    \ and share a large scale of data requires an efﬁcient data-sharing scheme\nthat\
    \ overcomes data leakage and security threats. Decentralized blockchain technology\n\
    offers traceability, security, privacy, tamper-resistance, transparency, and immutability\
    \ to\nhandle data-sharing issues in the 6G network. Khowaja et al., in [51], aimed\
    \ to offer a secure\nand reliable data-exchange scheme using a private blockchain,\
    \ i.e., Hyperledger Fabric\nfor vehicular networks. Additionally, they developed\
    \ a deep-learning-based autoencoder\nsegmentation approach that gathers the vehicles\
    \ based on their similarity. The proposed\ndata-sharing scheme achieved better\
    \ throughput, CPU utilization, efﬁciency, applicability,\ncomputational overhead,\
    \ and time complexity.\nFurther, Zhang et al. [52] combined permissioned blockchain\
    \ with federated learning\n(FL) and proposed a channel-based distributed data-sharing\
    \ scheme for data sharing and\npreserving the privacy of the user. Moreover, they\
    \ proposed a data storage scheme using on-\nand off-chain data storage for authenticating\
    \ identity, data, and transactions. The adopted\nscheme enhanced data sharing\
    \ and security, improved data model quality, and prevented\nmalicious attacks.\
    \ Then, in [53], the authors proposed a concrete access control mechanism\nfor\
    \ vehicular communication (vehicular ad hoc network (VANET)). For that, they integrated\n\
    blockchain with ciphertext-enabled attribute encryption (CP-ABE) for user and\
    \ data storage\nidentity management. Further, they enhanced the security mechanism\
    \ and designed the\nadvanced attributed algorithm that minimizes the lightweight\
    \ device’s computational\npressure in VANET. The ﬁndings show that the proposed\
    \ scheme provides effective data\nsecurity with low performance overhead.\n3.4.\
    \ Resource Management\nThe most important service in a 6G wireless communication\
    \ system is utilizing various\nmobile resources such as memory, bandwidth, power,\
    \ and channel. However, managing\nthese resources and fulﬁlling user demands,\
    \ such as on-demand service and real-time visi-\nbility, is critical. Moreover,\
    \ an increasing number of smart applications, such as smart cities,\nsmart homes,\
    \ e-healthcare, smart grid, smart agriculture, autonomous vehicle, holographic\n\
    communication, etc., require real-time access to various resources. Therefore,\
    \ resource uti-\nlization, allocation, and management are required based on user\
    \ needs. Many researchers\nSensors 2023, 23, 969\n11 of 26\nhave proposed efﬁcient\
    \ and optimal resource allocation schemes [54–57]; however, these\nschemes are\
    \ centralized, where a single authority veriﬁes the user and allocates resources\n\
    as per their need. They face various security threats, such as user identity,\
    \ information\nconﬁdentiality, malicious attacks, and a single point of failure.\
    \ Blockchain is considered to\nbe a promising technology to address the abovementioned\
    \ issues. For example, Li et al.,\nin [58], integrated blockchain with MEC-based\
    \ IoT applications to enhance the performance\nof network attributes and ensure\
    \ data-sharing authenticity. They presented the cloud–edge\ncollaborative resource\
    \ allocation mechanism by introducing a collective reinforcement\nlearning (CRL)\
    \ scheme. The authors jointly optimized the data ofﬂoading, blockchain node\n\
    intervals, and transmit power to enhance the energy efﬁciency of the proposed\
    \ scheme.\nIn [59], the authors incorporated blockchain technology with the Internet\
    \ of Every-\nthing (IoE) applications. They proposed a blockchain-enabled metaheuristic\
    \ approach\nfor resource allocation in a cyber twin-driven 6G-IoE environment.\
    \ Additionally, they\ndesigned an optimal resource allocation algorithm using\
    \ graph clustering based on a quasi-\noppositional search and rescue optimization\
    \ approach. Their ﬁndings showed that the\nproposed work reduced average system\
    \ cost to 2.63 and power consumption to 0.012 mW\ncompared to the predeﬁned work.\
    \ Further, Yang et al. [60] intended to optimize the In-\ndustrial IoT device’s\
    \ energy allocation by reducing energy consumption and computation\noverhead.\
    \ Therefore, they incorporated blockchain with IIoT systems and proposed a deep\n\
    Q-learning (DQL)-enabled optimization framework that ensures data security and\
    \ energy\nefﬁciency. Finally, the proposed scheme is compared with existing approaches,\
    \ and it\nperforms better in terms of the computation overhead and weighted cost.\n\

    \ for Public\nSafety Application\nThis section shows the working of the proposed\
    \ architecture, which is AI-, blockchain-,\nand 6G-based secure UAV communication\
    \ for public safety scenarios such as ﬁre incidents,\nroad accidents, and criminal\
    \ activity. Figure 2 shows ﬁve layers of the proposed architecture,\ni.e., data,\
    \ intelligence, blockchain, application, and communication layers. The working\

    13 of 26\n4.1. Data Layer\nIn this layer, we considered different emergency services,\
    \ such as ﬁre incidents, road\naccidents, and criminal activity, which require\
    \ faster communication to deliver sensitive\ninformation (e.g., road accidents\
    \ and medical emergencies) to the entities of the applica-\ntion layers. Here,\
    \ UAVs are incorporated to monitor the abovementioned scenarios and\ncollect data\
    \ from them to assist in making a decisive decision for different public safety\n\
    applications. For instance, if a criminal attempts to perform a crime at a particular\
    \ location,\nthe UAVs collect the data from the location and forward it to the\
    \ nearby police station.\nHowever, the criminal can hire an attacker to perform\
    \ adversarial attacks on the collected\ndata to avoid legal protection. An attacker\
    \ can perform different network-related attacks to\nexploit the crime data stored\
    \ in the central repository of police stations. Therefore, there is a\nrequirement\
    \ for an intelligent and automated approach that can seamlessly detect nefarious\n\
    patterns in the network and eradicate it from the public safety environment.\n\
    4.2. Intelligence Layer\nIn this layer, we apply different machine learning (ML)\
    \ classiﬁers that classify the data\ninto attack and nonattack categories. As\
    \ discussed in the data layer, UAVs collect data from\nvarious application scenarios\
    \ and store that data in comma-separated value (CSV) ﬁles.\nThe feature space\
    \ of the dataset is discussed as follows.\n4.2.1. Dataset Description\nIn that\
    \ direction, ﬁrst, we collect the criminal activity dataset from the Kaggle [61]\n\
    that classiﬁes the data into attack and nonattack from the criminal’s behavior.\
    \ However,\nthe collected dataset is not enough to identify the attack or nonattack\
    \ category; therefore, we\naccumulate more data from different sources having\
    \ relevant criminal activity information.\nThe ﬁnal dataset Ψ consists of different\
    \ attributes such as location, crime type, weapon type,\na weapon used or not,\
    \ etc. It has n rows, a1, a2, a3, . . . , an and m columns, b1, b2, b3, . . .\
    \ , bm.\na1, a2, a3, . . . , an ∈ Ψ\n(1)\nb1, b2, b3, . . . , bn ∈ Ψ\n(2)\nwhere\
    \ n is the total count of row 1575 and m is the total count of column 9. The collected\n\
    dataset is stored in the comma-separated values (CSV) ﬁle and further passed to\
    \ the next\nlayer, which is the intelligence layer. Here, there is a risk of data\
    \ modiﬁcation on the judicial\ndata collected from the aforementioned critical\
    \ application scenarios. Therefore, there is a\nneed for data security that protects\
    \ sensitive data from malicious threats.\n4.2.2. ML Classiﬁcation Approach\nThe\
    \ CSV ﬁle has missing values, noise, and unmanaged data columns that affect the\n\
    performance of the ML classiﬁer. To overcome this issue, we replace the missing\
    \ value\nwith central tendency, i.e., mean value. Further, the dataset has numeric\
    \ and textual values\n(alphanumeric), such as location, crime, and weapon types;\
    \ therefore, there is a need to\nconvert nonnumerical data into numeric data.\
    \ We apply the label-encoding technique Le\nthat assigns a numerical value to\
    \ each categorical value.\n∀b3, b4, b5\napply\n−−−→ Le ∈ Ψ\n(3)\nAfter reading\
    \ the CSV ﬁle, we realize that the dataset attributes have different datatype\n\
    D, such as an object, int, and ﬂoat. However, certain ML classiﬁers do not recognize\n\
    attributes with object datatype. To overcome this issue, we change the datatype\
    \ from\nﬂoating to the int using the astype() function.\n∀b7, b8\nchange\n−−−−→\
    \ D\n(4)\nSensors 2023, 23, 969\n14 of 26\nThen, we analyze outliers that corrupt\
    \ the dataset and mislead the ML classiﬁers for\nthe wrong classiﬁcation. For\
    \ that, we apply outlier detection techniques that normalize\nthe data using a\
    \ standard scale without distorting differences in the ranges of values or\nlosing\
    \ information. Various normalization approaches exist, such as min-max, standard-\n\
    ization scaling, and Z-score. Here, we apply the min-max method that is mathematically\n\
    represented as follows.\nϑ\n′ =\nϑ − ϑmin\nϑmax − ϑmin\n(5)\nThis normalization\
    \ technique obtains all the scaled data into the range of 0 to 1.\nAfter preprocessing\
    \ the data, we split the data into two classes, training and testing, where\n\
    we train 80% of the data and validate 20% of the data. We pass the training dataset\
    \ (ΨT1)\ninto the ML classiﬁer that classiﬁes the data into attack (1) and nonattack\
    \ (0) categories.\nΨT1\nf ed\n−→ MLc\nclassi f y\n−−−−→ data\n(\n0\n1\n(6)\nAfter\
    \ training the model, we feed the testing dataset (ΨT2) into the ML classiﬁer\
    \ that\nvalidates the results based on the ΨT1.\nΨT2\nf ed\n−→ MLc\nclassi f y\n\
    −−−−→ data\n(\n0\n1\n(7)\nHere, we applied different ML classiﬁers, such as XGBoost,\
    \ random forest (RF), k-\nnearest neighbor (KNN), logistic regression (LR), and\
    \ support vector machine (SVM),\nthat classify the data into attack and nonattack.\
    \ Among all these classiﬁers, we obtained\nthe best results in terms of the accuracy\
    \ and log loss score from the XGBoost algorithm.\nThe XGBoost classiﬁer gives\
    \ effective results with the larger dataset. In this classiﬁer,\nthe data are\
    \ considered for each tree, and we can increase the depth of the tree and decrease\n\
    the min_child_weight that handles the overﬁtting issue in the dataset. The classiﬁed\
    \ data\nare susceptible, which raises the security issue in a public safety application.\
    \ To overcome\nthis issue, we utilize the IPFS-based blockchain network that offers\
    \ the data’s authentication\nand conﬁdentiality, preventing fraud on the dataset.\n\
    4.3. Blockchain Layer\nBlockchain is a decentralized distributed ledger technology\
    \ that keeps immutable\nrecords of transactions. This layer provides security\
    \ to the classiﬁed data by storing them in\na shared and transparent ledger that\
    \ is only accessible to the authorized network members.\nHere, the data are recorded\
    \ as a block in a blockchain network through the smart contract\n(Sc). Here, a\
    \ smart contract is an agreement between the contract creator and recipient that\n\
    executes automatically when all parties can be sure of the conclusion [10]. Then,\
    \ to provide\na reliable connection between contract and storage, there is an\
    \ interplanetary ﬁle system\n(IPFS) that offers efﬁcient storage and is able to\
    \ share a large ﬁle.\ndata\npass\n−−→ Sc\n(8)\nSc\nStoredata\n−−−−−→ I f\n(9)\n\
    where I f is an IPFS ﬁle system that utilizes content-addressing that uniquely\
    \ retrieves\neach ﬁle in the blockchain network. It stores the data in the blockchain\
    \ network using a\ndistributed hash table (HT). Each stored ﬁle is allocated a\
    \ unique hash value according to\nSensors 2023, 23, 969\n15 of 26\nthe content\
    \ of the ﬁle. The mathematical representation of the aforementioned entity is\n\
    as follows.\nI f\ngenerate\n−−−−→ {H1, H1, . . . , Hn} store\n−−→ HT\n(10)\nHT\n\
    add\n−−→ {Block1, Block2, . . . , Blockn}\n(11)\n{Block1, Block2, . . . , Blockn}\
    \ ∈ Blockchainn\n(12)\nHere, different authorized users such as the ﬁre department,\
    \ hospital authority, and po-\nlice retrieve the secure data.\n4.4. Application\
    \ Layer\nThis layer includes different authorities such as the ﬁre department,\
    \ hospital authority,\nand police for ﬁre incidents, road accidents, and criminal\
    \ activity, respectively. This\nauthority uses the classiﬁed data for further\
    \ analysis, prediction, and research purposes.\nFor the proposed architecture,\
    \ we considered a criminal behavior dataset that has the crime\nlocation, crime\
    \ type, weapon used, weapon type, etc., attributes that classify the data into\n\
    attack (class 1) or nonattack (class 0). These data will be stored in the IPFS-based\
    \ blockchain.\nFrom that, the police department or any government-regularized\
    \ authority can access\nthe data securely. The advantage of this layer is that\
    \ the public safety regulatory body\n(e.g., emergency response team) acquires\
    \ the attack-free data. This is because the proposed\narchitecture prohibits any\
    \ data injection attacks on secure data storage (blockchain); even if\nthe attackers\
    \ perform any attack on the data storage, it will be known by each blockchain\n\
    participant due to the transparency features of the blockchain technology. Thus,\
    \ the\nproposed architecture offers robust security and reliable communication\
    \ for IoT-based\npublic safety applications.\n4.5. Communication Layer\nThis layer\
    \ comprises the relation between all four layers. We collected criminal\nactivity\
    \ data from the data layer that are further passed to the intelligence layer.\
    \ The data\nwere preprocessed in the intelligence layer and fed into the ML classiﬁer\
    \ that classiﬁes\nthem into the attack and nonattack classes. The classiﬁed data\
    \ are sensitive to security\nthreats and require immutable and secure storage.\
    \ For that, we store those data in the\ndecentralized and secure IPFS-based blockchain\
    \ layer. In the application layer, authorized\nusers, such as employees from the\
    \ ﬁre department, hospital, and police, access the data\nusing their smartphones,\
    \ tablet, laptop, or other 6G-based gadgets. They all need a strong\ncommunication\
    \ channel with a high data rate and low latency with secure and relevant\ndata\
    \ analysis. Moreover, the data layer to the blockchain layer is synchronized using\
    \ a\npipeline via the 6G network interface. Here, the data coming from the blockchain\
    \ layer\nare ﬁrst converted into the digital signal using a Bernoulli binary digital\
    \ converter and\nthen forwarded into a transmitter block. Here, for the simulation,\
    \ we considered MATLAB-\nbased 5G toolbox that offers certain parameters, such\
    \ as frequency range, modulation\ntechniques, channel impairments, sub-carrier\
    \ spacing, and bandwidth. By modifying these\nparameters, we can mimic the behavior\
    \ of 5G interface to 6G interface. We used a frequency\nrange of 75–110 GHz (operational\
    \ frequency—95 GHz) which is a potential frequency\nrange for beyond 5G speciﬁed\
    \ by the [62], sub-carrier spacing of 240 KHz, and modulation\nwas orthogonal\
    \ frequency division multiplexing (OFDMA), with polar coding for error\ndetection\
    \ and correction. The main aim is not to simulate the 6G network for the speciﬁed\n\
    problem formulation but to use essential properties of the 6G network. This is\
    \ because\nthe 6G simulation is not yet open-sourced by the scientiﬁc community;\
    \ therefore, we have\nto rely on a 5G simulation setup to impersonate the behavior\
    \ of the 6G network. Here,\nthe 6G network interface takes the stored data from\
    \ the blockchain layer and transmits\nthem to the application layer via a 6G network.\
    \ Thus, data, intelligence, and blockchain\nSensors 2023, 23, 969\n16 of 26\n\
    layers cumulatively act as a sender that intends to share the data to the application\
    \ layer\nvia adopting 6G communication for faster and reliable communication.\n\
    5. Result and Discussion\nThis section highlightsexperimentation details and results\
    \ analysis of the proposed\narchitecture in terms of accuracy, log loss score,\
    \ and validation curve.\n5.1. Experimental Setup\nThe proposed architecture utilizes\
    \ a Google Colaboratory notebook for developing\nan intelligence layer that uses\
    \ ML classiﬁers, Remix integrated development environment\n(IDE) for the blockchain\
    \ layer, and MATLAB 2022a for the communication layer. The Google\nColaboratory\
    \ notebook is a web IDE for Python programming that uses various Python\nlibraries\
    \ such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Sklearn, and Scipy for the ML classiﬁers.\n\
    To simulate the working of the intelligent layer, we incorporated the Google Colaboratory\n\
    notebook that uses ML classiﬁers and provides the classiﬁcation of the data. Here,\
    \ different\nML classiﬁers, such as XGboost, RF, KNN, LR, and SVM, have hyperparameters\
    \ that tailor\nthe classiﬁers’ behavior and improve performance. Table 3 depicts\
    \ the parameters used in\nthe proposed architecture. Here, n_estimators, learning_rate,\
    \ and max_depth are used for\nthe XGBoost classiﬁer, where n_estimators represents\
    \ the tree’s count. Then, learning_rate is\nused as the regularization parameter\
    \ that shows the step size, and the max_depth parameter\ncontrols the overﬁtting\
    \ in the model. The RF classiﬁer used n_estimators value of 200 and\nmax_depth\
    \ value of 1. Moreover, KNN uses the n_neighbors parameter to show the total\n\
    count of neighbors that are utilizedby default for the k-neighbors queries. Furthermore,\n\
    the uniform weights specify that all points are equally weighted in each neighborhood.\
    \ The\nLR classiﬁer uses random_state that shufﬂes the data and the “lbfgs” solver\
    \ with max_iter\nthat uses the solvers to converge. For the SVM classiﬁer, we\
    \ use different parameters such\nas gamma, probability, and kernel. Here, we use\
    \ rbf and linear kernel with the kernel\ncoefﬁcient value such as gamma = “auto”,\
    \ which means 1/n_f eatures.\nTable 3. Parameters of the proposed architecture.\n\

    Network\nRinkeby’s\nEnvironment\nRemix VM\nThe classiﬁed data have sensitive and\
    \ conﬁdential information and require secure\nstorage. Therefore, the classiﬁed\
    \ data are stored in the IPFS-based blockchain network\nusing a smart contract\
    \ in the blockchain layer. The smart contract is implemented using\nsolidity language\
    \ on the Remix IDE with different functions, such as criminal behaviors()\nto\
    \ identify the criminal, weapon() to determine the crime type, addlocation() to\
    \ know\nthe crime spot, updatecount(), and many more. The smart contract is deployed\
    \ over the\nSensors 2023, 23, 969\n17 of 26\nRinkeby’s network. On a successful\
    \ compilation and deployment of the smart contract,\nvalidated or authenticated\
    \ data from the smart contract are forwarded to the IPFS-based\npublic blockchain\
    \ for secure storage. Further, the 6G network is simulated on MATLAB\n2022a using\
    \ a 5G toolbox. This is because there is not yet any open-source software available\n\
    that provides 6G properties and can integrate that with real-world applications.\
    \ Due to this\nconstraint, we utilized a 5G-based simulation toolbox, where we\
    \ changed the simulation\nparameters, for example, changing the bandwidth allocation,\
    \ transmit power, sub-carrier\nspacing (240 KHz), and modulation (OFDMA) techniques\
    \ of the 5G network to impersonate\na 6G network.\n5.2. Performance Evaluation\
    \ of the Proposed Architecture\nIn this subsection, we discuss the results of\
    \ the ML classiﬁers, blockchain, and 6G\ncommunication. First, we analyze the\
    \ performance of the different ML classiﬁers, such as\nXGBoost, RF, KNN, LR, and\
    \ SVM, for UAV-based public safety applications such as ﬁre\nincidents, road accidents,\
    \ and criminal activity. Here, ML classiﬁers are used to classify the\ndata into\
    \ attack means class 1 and nonattack means class 0. We considered the criminal\n\
    activity dataset that has the crime type, location, weapon type, and criminal\
    \ behavior\nrecords. These records are useful for classifying the arrest and nonarrest\
    \ categories, which\nidentiﬁes whether the data are vulnerable to attack or not.\
    \ Here, we fed 80% of the data\ninto the ML classiﬁer that provide training to\
    \ the classiﬁer. Then, the 20% testing dataset\nis passed into the ML classiﬁer\
    \ that validates the training dataset. It also ensures that the\ntrained data\
    \ will behave consistently and produce the expected results.\nHere, Figure 3 depicts\
    \ the performance of the ML classiﬁers in terms of the accuracy,\nlog loss score,\
    \ and validation curve. The accuracy (α) of the ML classiﬁers represents\nthe\
    \ ratio of the correctly predicted values out of a total number of predictions.\
    \ Using an\naccuracy measure, we know how many times the ML classiﬁer correctly\
    \ classiﬁed the\ndataset. We can express accuracy in true positive (Tρ), false\
    \ positive (Fρ), true negative (Tη),\nand false negative (Fη) values that are\
    \ used to represent the number of correct and incorrect\npredictions of the proposed\
    \ ML classiﬁer. During the simulation, we observe that a single\naccuracy parameter\
    \ is insufﬁcient to remark on the best ML classiﬁer. Therefore, we require\nadditional\
    \ measures such as precision (β) and recall (γ). Precision represents the correctness\n\
    of the ML classiﬁer. It determines how good the classiﬁer is at predicting a speciﬁc\
    \ class. It\nshows the ratio between the true positive samples and all the positive\
    \ outcomes Tρ + Fρ.\nThe recall measure represents the count, which shows how\
    \ many times the ML classiﬁer\nwas able to determine a speciﬁc class. It gives\
    \ the ratio between true positive samples out\nof all the cases of true positive\
    \ and false negative samples Tρ + Fη. Furthermore, harmonic\nmean of the precision\
    \ and recall is called F1-score (δ). The mathematical representation of\nthese\
    \ performance measures are represented as follows:\nα =\nTρ + Tη\nTρ + Fρ + Tη\
    \ + Fη\n(13)\nβ =\nTρ\nTρ + Fρ\n(14)\nγ =\nTρ\nTρ + Fη\n(15)\nδ = 2 ∗ β ∗ γ\n\
    β + γ\n(16)\nFigure 3a illustrates the accuracy of the different ML classiﬁers\
    \ such as XGBoost, RF,\nKNN, LR, and SVM. From the graph, we found that XGBoost\
    \ classiﬁer gives better accuracy\n(87.93%) compared to the other classiﬁers because\
    \ it handles sparse data and executes\nparallel computing. On the contrary, SVM\
    \ did not perform well because it required high\nSensors 2023, 23, 969\n18 of\
    \ 26\ntraining time for the large dataset. Table 4 shows that the XGBoost classiﬁer\
    \ outperforms\nany other ML classiﬁers in terms of accuracy, precision, recall,\
    \ and F1-score.\nTo further measure the ML classiﬁer’s performance, we used a\
    \ log loss score that\nindicates how close the prediction probability is to the\
    \ corresponding actual value in the\nbinary classiﬁcation case. It represents\
    \ the probabilities of the correct class label, which\nmeans that if the predicted\
    \ probability is high, it will obtain a low log loss core and\nvice versa. Figure\
    \ 3b shows the log loss score of the different ML classiﬁers that evaluate\nthe\
    \ performance of the classiﬁers. From the empirical results, we analyzed that\
    \ there is\na higher divergence in the log loss score of the LR and SVM classiﬁers.\
    \ Here, XGBoost’s\nlog loss score is small; therefore, it performed well compared\
    \ to the other ML classiﬁers.\nAdditionally, Figure 3c depicts the validation\
    \ curve of the XGBoost classiﬁer that indicates\nthe sensitivity between changes\
    \ in a classiﬁer’s accuracy and changes in some parameters\nof the classiﬁer.\
    \ Here, if the training score is more than the validation score, the estimator\
    \ is\noverﬁtting, and otherwise performs well.\nXGBoost\nRF\nKNN\nLR\nSVM\nML\

    \ of the literature we observed does not\namalgamate the mentioned key enabler\
    \ technologies, i.e., blockchain, 6G network, AI,\netc. Their approach is based\
    \ on a single technology, but by using that, there must be a\nSensors 2023, 23,\
    \ 969\n19 of 26\nloophole that exists that the attackers can exploit. Therefore,\
    \ an amalgamation of technology\nis needed to offer a secure pipeline for data\
    \ exchange for critical applications, such as\npublic safety applications. The\
    \ work of [63] is similar to our proposed work with better\naccuracies; however,\
    \ their work is based on an image dataset where they used rigorous\ndata augmentation\
    \ techniques and deep learning approaches to acquire better accuracies.\nBecause\
    \ of data augmentation and deep learning approaches, their proposed model is\n\
    highly complex and does not have a commendable system response time. This is because\n\
    deep learning techniques have a higher training time, due to which the response\
    \ becomes\nhigher; hence, one could not send critical data on time to the application\
    \ layer. This can\nalso be seen in Figure 4a, where performance overhead is compared\
    \ between [63] and the\nproposed work. It is clear from the graph that due to\
    \ the high training time, the work of [63]\nhas a high-performance overhead compared\
    \ to our work. Contrary, the proposed work uses\ntext data where minimal data\
    \ preprocessing steps are required to train ML classiﬁers. This\ncan be seen in\
    \ Figure 4b, where training time is computed for all ML classiﬁers. XGBoost is\n\
    outperforming other classiﬁers by attaining a training time of 280.97 s. In [63],\
    \ the authors\nused 1400 iterations to obtain a better training accuracy, which\
    \ takes longer training time\ncompared to our work.\n4\n8\n12\n16\n20\n24\n28\n\

    \ the blockchain scalability comparison between the proposed\nblockchain with\
    \ IPFS and the traditional blockchain. Generally, an IPFS-based blockchain is\n\
    a decentralized protocol and is open to the public; therefore, anyone who has\
    \ content hash\ncan access the network. Moreover, it offers persistent data storage,\
    \ fault tolerance against a\nsingle point of failure, and a censorship resistance\
    \ mechanism. Due to the aforesaid bene-\nﬁts, the IPFS-based blockchain has a\
    \ better response time than the traditional blockchain\n(i.e., not using IPFS).\
    \ In addition, the immutable nature of the IPFS-based blockchain eases\nnumerous\
    \ cybersecurity threats. It has no overheads of the consensus protocols to add\n\
    the data and only stores the content hash in the network. Thus, the consensus\
    \ and data\naggregation with transformation must be applied before submitting\
    \ a block or ﬁle to IPFS\nstorage. Due to this mechanism, the IPFS-based blockchain\
    \ is faster and more scalable than\nthe conventional blockchain network.\nFurthermore,\
    \ the proposed architecture consists of UAVs for data accumulation and\ndissemination\
    \ between different participants of public safety applications. As public\nsafety\
    \ applications are categorized under the umbrella of mission-critical applications,\n\
    they must ensure reliable and low-latency communication among all the entities\
    \ of the\nproposed architecture. Here, 6G networks fulﬁll the requirements essential\
    \ to the proposed\narchitecture. The 6G network offers high data-transmission\
    \ rates, with ultra-low latency\nthat makes it 1000 times faster than 5G networks.\
    \ Therefore, the network’s transmitter and\nSensors 2023, 23, 969\n20 of 26\n\

    \ of Adoption of Blockchain in 6G Network\nBlockchain technology entrenches data\
    \ security, user identity, information authenticity,\nand privacy mechanisms into\
    \ the 6G communication system. However, poor efﬁciency of\nconsensus mechanism,\
    \ computation overhead of network systems, storage capacity, limited\nnetwork\
    \ and computing resources, and cross-network sharing imposes a new challenge in\n\
    blockchain-based 6G application. This section provides the possible challenges\
    \ of adopting\nblockchain in the 6G network. Figure 7 displays the research challenges\
    \ when adopting\nblockchain in the 6G network.\nSensors 2023, 23, 969\n21 of 26\n\

    \ Challenges\nFigure 7. Blockchain adoption challenges in 6G network.\n6.1. Storage\
    \ Capacity\nBlockchain offers decentralized architecture with an immutable ledger\
    \ that securely\nstores the data transaction that cannot be tampered or altered.\
    \ Blockchain permanently\nkeeps data in immutable blocks and is not allowed to\
    \ be altered or deleted by anyone; there-\nfore, it keeps increasing data volume\
    \ and raising data storage capacity issues. During peak\ntime, an increasing number\
    \ of users and data transactions ﬂood the network, leading to\ntransaction delays\
    \ and network overloading issues. Moreover, due to a growing demand\nfor data\
    \ storage capacity and bandwidth, nodes cannot synchronize with each other to\n\
    join the network [64]. Various cloud platforms exist, such as IPFS, Merkle tree-based\
    \ ﬁle\nsystems (MTFS), StorJ, swarm, etc., that resolve the data storage issue\
    \ in the blockchain-\nbased 6G network. The research community has adopted these\
    \ data storage platforms\nwith blockchain and proposed solutions in supply chain\
    \ management, smart agriculture,\nsmart city, etc., to resolve storage issues.\
    \ For example, Pawar et al. [65] proposed an\nIPFS-enabled blockchain repository\
    \ for supply chain management to minimize ﬁle upload\nand download time. Kumar\
    \ et al. [66] introduced a secured privacy-preserving scheme to\nmaintain scalability\
    \ using IPFS-based off-chain storage for smart agricultural UAVs data.\nHowever,\
    \ these solutions face reliability, privacy, and security issues, such as that\
    \ IPFS does\nnot provide private ﬁle storage; it only offers public ﬁle access.\
    \ Likewise, MTFS has access\nspeed and scalability problems with public ﬁle systems.\
    \ From that, it has been noticed that\nthe limited data storage capacity of blockchain\
    \ is a notable challenge in the current and\nfuture networks.\n6.2. Poor Efﬁciency\
    \ of Consensus Mechanism\nThe blockchain network depends on various consensus\
    \ mechanisms such as prac-\ntical Byzantine fault tolerance (PBFT), proof-of-work,\
    \ and proof-of-stake for enterprise\nand permissionless blockchains. However,\
    \ these algorithms are inadequate because they\nconsume more time and energy for\
    \ block production. Researchers have designed various\nconsensus algorithms to\
    \ monitor and verify block production in 6G network. For example,\nWan et al.\
    \ [67] and Zhang et al. [68] proposed a consensus-algorithm-based strategy for\n\
    collision avoidance in UAV swarms and ﬁxed-wing UAVs, respectively. Still, there\
    \ is\nscope for research in this ﬁeld because the algorithms require higher energy\
    \ consumption\nand are vulnerable to malicious attacks such as the 51% attack,\
    \ Sybil attack, race attack,\nand Finney attack.\nSensors 2023, 23, 969\n22 of\
    \ 26\n6.3. Cross-Network or Cross-Domain Sharing\nBlockchain introduces an interoperability\
    \ feature that offers a cross-chain mechanism\nto transmit asserts, transaction\
    \ values, virtual contracts, and data between two or more\nblockchain networks.\
    \ Unfortunately, the lack of adequate privacy and maintaining the same\nlevel\
    \ of security raise cross-network sharing issues in blockchain-based 6G applications.\n\
    Recently, much work has been carried out for cross-network sharing in blockchain-enabled\n\
    smart applications. For example, in [69], the authors proposed a cross-network\
    \ data-\nsharing mechanism for the smart grid. Likewise, Xue et al. [70] presented\
    \ a cross-domain\nauthentication scheme for medical information sharing. Besides\
    \ these advantages, several\nchallenges remain to be addressed, such as data ownership\
    \ protection with QoS-based\nnetwork heterogeneity.\n6.4. Computation Overhead\n\
    The 6G applications are bandwidth- and resource-hungry; they require real-time\
    \ data\ntransmission. However, the increasing number of network users hinders\
    \ the QoS of the\ndeveloped applications. Therefore, blockchain integrates with\
    \ 6G technologies, reducing\nthe complex computational cost. A lot of research\
    \ has been carried out to overcome the\ncomputation overhead issue in blockchain-based\
    \ 6G applications. For instance, the work of\nChai et al. [71] offered a diffused-PBFT\
    \ approach to reduce computation overhead and con-\nsensus latency. Likewise,\
    \ in [72], the authors proposed an LSTM-based scheme to optimize\nthe computation\
    \ ofﬂoading in a satellite-UAV-based IoT system. Then, Ahmed et al. [73]\nintroduced\
    \ blockchain in VANET for vehicle authentication and emergency message trans-\n\
    mission between the Internet of vehicles (IoVs). They encrypted blockchain servers\
    \ using\nRSA-1024, a digital signature algorithm, to minimize the computation\
    \ overhead. However,\neach participating block of the blockchain and consensus\
    \ algorithms, such as proof-of-work\nand PBFT, require more computational power\
    \ for calculation. On top of that, the continu-\nous growth of IoT devices and\
    \ smart applications leads to high congestion in the network\nand computation\
    \ overhead, where it is infeasible to properly apply a blockchain-based\nconsensus\
    \ approach.\n6.5. Dynamically Changing Environment\nDigital technologies such\
    \ as AI, IoT, and robotics are continuously growing and chang-\ning the future\
    \ perspective, industrial demand, and human behavior. These technologies\nare\
    \ incorporated into various smart applications such as e-healthcare, smart homes,\
    \ smart\nagriculture, holographic communications and many more. According to user\
    \ demand\nfor a high transmission rate with lower latency, these technologies\
    \ should respond in the\nreal-time environment of industries and organizations.\
    \ Moreover, blockchain networks\nare incorporated in dynamic, experimental, and\
    \ sustainable future technologies to intro-\nduce trust, authenticity, security,\
    \ and privacy [74]. The research community has offered\nmany solutions based on\
    \ blockchain for a dynamic changing environment. For example,\nXiao et al. [75]\
    \ proposed temporal pattern attention and enabled the LSTM approach to\nsense\
    \ the change of natural gas deliverability in natural-gas-based IoT systems. They\n\
    utilized a blockchain-based smart contract that dynamically matched the purchase\
    \ and\nsale details of the gas; it also enhanced the buyer’s and the seller’s\
    \ interests. As a result,\nthey could predict the outcome of natural gas in real-time\
    \ according to the dynamic de-\nmand for sales. However, modeling such a real-time\
    \ technique is highly complex and\ntime-consuming in a dynamic changing environment.\n\
    7. Conclusions\nBlockchain is distributed ledger technology that offers reliability,\
    \ security, immutabil-\nity, and privacy in the 6G-based futuristic smart application.\
    \ It proves its effectiveness by\nproviding trust been two parties in the wireless\
    \ communication network. Many research\ncommunities have discussed the adoption\
    \ of blockchain for 6G-based smart applications\nwith new digital technologies,\
    \ such as IoT, AI, and MEC. This technology offers real-time\nSensors 2023, 23,\
    \ 969\n23 of 26\ncommunication with a higher transmission rate; however, it adds\
    \ various challenges, mak-\ning it difﬁcult to adapt to a 6G network. Therefore,\
    \ it is required to propose an exhaustive\nwork highlighting the ﬁndings of multiple\
    \ researchers who worked in the blockchain-\nbased 6G networks. We discussed various\
    \ 6G applications where blockchain is adopted\nfor the security and privacy of\
    \ data. Further, we discussed blockchain-based services in\nthe 6G network. Then,\
    \ we proposed layer-wise architecture by adopting AI, blockchain,\nand a 6G network\
    \ to protect sensitive crime data in public safety applications. An attacker\n\
    tries to manipulate criminal activity information systems to avoid legal action;\
    \ therefore,\nthe proposed architecture offers a secure pipeline to protect public\
    \ safety applications from\nthe nefarious offense. The proposed architecture is\
    \ evaluated on numerous performance\nevaluation metrics such as accuracy, scalability,\
    \ and packet drop rate. Lastly, we identiﬁed\nthe challenge of adopting the blockchain\
    \ in the 6G wireless networks.\nIn the future, based on this work, we will develop\
    \ a novel solution that mitigates the\nidentiﬁed issues and improves the performance\
    \ of the blockchain-based 6G system.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization:\

  limitations:
  - The limited data storage capacity of blockchain is a notable challenge in the
    current and future networks.
  - Blockchain-based algorithms are inadequate because they consume more time and
    energy for block production.

    \ all areas \nof human life more comfortable. The development of farms \nthrough\
    \ the use of IoT positively influences agricultural \nproduction not only by strengthening\
    \ it, but also by making it \nmore profitable and reducing the cost of production.\
    \ The goal of \nthis paper is to offer a new IoT-based smart agriculture system\
    \ \nthat helps farmers get real-time data such as (temperature, \nhumidity, soil\
    \ moisture) for effective environmental monitoring \nthat will allow them to increase\
    \ overall yield and product quality. \nThe farm monitoring system proposed in\
    \ this paper is based on \nthe ESP32 microcontroller with a set of sensors. This\
    \ new model \nproduces a real-time data feed that can be viewed online via a \n\
    mobile app. The proposed new system uses solar energy with \nbattery as an energy\
    \ source. \nKeywords—IoT; smart agriculture; new model; solar panel; \nesp32;\

    \ role for the \nhuman being and for the economies of countries, indeed \ncountries\
    \ that have experienced significant economic growth \nhave experienced a significant\
    \ increase in the agricultural \nsector, agriculture is not only an important\
    \ factor of economic \ngrowth but also a heritage, a way of life, a cultural identity\
    \ of a \ncountry. The use of the Internet of Things in agriculture makes \nit\
    \ possible to put technology at the service of the development \nof agriculture\
    \ and also to help the farmer to: \n Make very important decisions at the right\
    \ times. \n Save energy and time. \n Deal with the lack of information. \n\
    \ Increase agricultural production. \n Allow the farmer to develop and develop\
    \ his \nagricultural production. \n Increase the participation of agriculture\
    \ in job creation. \n Ensure our country's needs for agricultural products. \n\

    \ \nThe processing and analysis of the work carried out in this \narea will allow\
    \ us to compare the following attributes: data \ncollected, technologies used,\
    \ challenges of the current \napproach. Table II shows this comparison. During\
    \ our analysis, \nwe excluded the number of sensors, the amount of data \ncollected,\
    \ the underlying technologies, the topology of the \nsensors and other intermediate\
    \ gateways were not included as \nthis does not add value to our research work.\
    \ \nIII. DISCUSSIONS AND RESULTS \nA. Data Analysis \nThe analysis of the data\

    \ of application. The objective of this analysis is to \nincrease productivity\
    \ and efficiency while saving natural and \nhuman resources in the agricultural\
    \ sector. \nB. Agricultural Domains \nWe have grouped the articles and classified\
    \ them by \nagricultural field, as shown in Table III below. This ranking \ngave\

    \ \nE. Results \nIn this paper, we were able to study the use of IOT in the \n\
    agricultural field, this allowed us to identify important \nattributes to analyze\
    \ it, for this we gathered and analyzed \nrecent scientific data, this survey\
    \ was a way to have the list of \nthe most studied sub-areas: Smart irrigation,\
    \ Agriculture \nMonitoring, Smart farming, Greenhouse Agriculture. \n Smart irrigation\
    \ is the most studied agricultural sub-field in \nrecent years, as most countries\
    \ focus mainly on the use of \nwater resources due to its lack. Smart irrigation\
    \ has become an \nessential means that positively influence the agricultural field\
    \ \nand its production, current efforts focus on the management of \nwater resources\
    \ this has given great value to irrigation \nmanagement to increase the quality\
    \ and quantity of agricultural \nproducts. \nThe second sub-area is forecast agriculture\
    \ because the \ndemand for products is constantly increasing so it is essential\
    \ to \nopt for a forward-looking management of agricultural \nproduction. This\
    \ makes it possible to review any risk that can \nblock the objectives of farmers\
    \ and makes it possible to ensure \na quality and increase in agricultural production\
    \ and also saves \nresources. Based on our analysis, it was found that ambient\
    \ \ntemperature followed by soil moisture and moisture are among \nthe most commonly\
    \ measured data. According to the results of \nour study, it was found that the\
    \ use of the Internet of Things in \nagriculture can be used effectively to increase\
    \ agricultural \nproduction to meet the growing needs of the population. \nThe\
    \ majority of research focuses on water management by \nmonitoring environmental\
    \ parameters such as temperature, \nhumidity and soil moisture. Many results have\
    \ emphasized the \nimportance of the proper management of water resources, \n\
    saving human and material resources. \nInnovation in the IT field makes it possible\
    \ to cover all \nagricultural areas to allow an important development. IoT has\
    \ \nsolved many problems related to agriculture and farming, but \nseveral limitations\
    \ are to be taken into consideration such as \nthe lack of interoperability and\
    \ compatibility of devices, the \nproblems of network flexibility when several\
    \ devices connect, \nand the lifetime of the sensor are some of the limitations\
    \ to be \nsolved in future research. \nFood production is a great challenge for\
    \ all economies \naround the world due to the rapid and constant evolution of\
    \ the \nworld's population, especially with climate change and labour \nshortages.\
    \ Currently, current research focuses on robotics to \nsolve these problems. Many\
    \ researchers and companies have \nfocused on robotics and artificial intelligence\
    \ (AI) to reduce the \namount of herbicide used by farmers. \nFollowing the analysis\
    \ of the data collected, it was found \nthat the IOT is in great demand to develop\
    \ the agricultural \nfield, several researches have been carried out in relation\
    \ to this \nsubject, the articles that we studied in this report have not taken\
    \ \ninto consideration the sources of energy to power the IOT \nequipment and\
    \ the security of agricultural fields against \nintrusions, thus the majority\
    \ of articles use Arduino technology \nfor the interconnection of IOT equipment,\
    \ which is why we \nwill propose a new model that will take into account the energy\
    \ \nsource, uses an interconnection technology with low energy \nconsumption and\
    \ secures agricultural fields against intrusions. \nIV. NEW MODEL \nA. Solution\
    \ \nAfter the in-depth study of the work done in this area, we \nfound that agriculture\
    \ is one of the main areas that use IoT. \nSeveral IoT components have already\
    \ been put in place to \nserve the agricultural field to monitor soil conditions\
    \ such as \ntemperature, moisture, soil moisture and soil ph. \nWe also found\
    \ that most authors propose solutions \nprovided by wires or batteries such as\
    \ power sources, the \nthings that make powering objects a real challenge for\
    \ several \nreasons, the most important of which are: \n The area of agricultural\
    \ land is large, which increases \nthe cost of installing electrical cables. The\
    \ installed \ncables remain subject to damage that can be caused by \nagricultural\
    \ vehicles, insects, and water, as the cables \nare underground. \n The difficulties\
    \ of maintenance and repair in case of \nfailure because the cables are underground\
    \ it is \nnecessary at each failure to remove them to repair them. \n Battery\
    \ life remains limited and varies from a few hours \nto several years. \n The\
    \ power of objects by alkaline batteries has major \ndisadvantages. These batteries\
    \ have a limited amount of \nenergy. \n The cost of purchasing and replacing\
    \ the batteries of the \nobjects. \nWe offer a solution that offers an improvement\
    \ of existing \nsolutions. Our model is highly customizable and provides a \n\
    data analysis solution that enables large-scale data processing \non real-time\
    \ observation streams. Our new model uses solar \nenergy with battery as a power\
    \ source, the ESP32 \nmicrocontroller as a low-energy interconnection technology\
    \ \n[30] and a motion detector to protect our agricultural field from \nintrusions.\
    \ \nB. Components \n1) Ph: Sensor: The PH sensor is a sensor that allows \ndetermining\
    \ the acidity of the soil between 0 and 14 at a \ntemperature between 0 and 60\
    \ ° C, this acidity varies \ndepending on the availability of nutrients in water\
    \ / soil. The \ndetection of PH is therefore essential to understand how to \n\
    fertilize it properly in order to prepare a good environment for \nagricultural\
    \ production. Fig. 1 shows the ph sensor. \n2) Temperature and humidity sensor:\
    \ The DHT11 sensor \nis a low-cost basic digital temperature and humidity sensor.\
    \ \nCapable of measuring temperatures from 0 to 50°C with an \naccuracy of 2°C\
    \ and relative humidity levels from 20 to 80% \nwith an accuracy of 5%. A measurement\
    \ can be made every \nsecond. Fig. 2 shows the DHT11 sensor. \n(IJACSA) International\

    detect movements (of animals and humans) in their agricultural \nfields. Fig.\
    \ 3 shows the PIR sensor. \n \nFig. 3. PIR Sensor. \n4) Soil Moisture Sensor:\
    \ This sensor, as shown in Fig. 4, \nmeasures soil moisture due to changes in\
    \ the electrical \nconductivity of the earth (soil resistance increases with \n\
    drought). A digital output with an adjustable threshold is used \nto trigger an\
    \ alarm or sprinkler pump. A second analog output \naccurately tracks fluctuations\
    \ in soil moisture. When the sensor \nfork is planted vertically in the ground\
    \ (agricultural fields, \ngarden, etc.). The electrical resistance between the\
    \ two \nelectrodes is measured. \n \nFig. 4. Soil Moisture Sensor. \n5) ESP32\
    \ Microcontroller: The ESP32, illustrated in \nFig. 5 designed and produced by\
    \ the company Espressif, it \nintegrates functions dedicated to the Internet of\
    \ Things and \nmore particularly wireless communications and Bluetooth and \n\
    lora for a reduced cost. It is the best choice for smart cities, \nsmart farms,\
    \ and smart homes. \n \nFig. 5. Esp32. \n6) Solar panel: Solar panels, shown in\
    \ Fig. 6, are the \ndevices used to absorb the sun's rays and convert them into\
    \ \nelectricity. In our case we will use solar panels to power our \nIoT devices.\
    \ \n \nFig. 6. Solar Panel. \n7) Lithium Batteries: In our case we will use the\
    \ lithium \nbattery illustrated in Fig. 7, to have the possibility of setting\
    \ up \nan autonomous network equipped with a battery capable of \nstoring energy\
    \ during the day and provides electricity during \nthe night. \n \nFig. 7. Batteries.\
    \ \n8) Top-up card for power bank: In our case we will use the \ncharge card,\
    \ illustrated in Fig. 8, to build a power bank from \nlithium battery cells to\
    \ charge all IOT devices compatible \nwith 5V. \n \nFig. 8. Power Bank. \nC. System\
    \ Description \nTo achieve a high-quality yield, we will build a new smart \n\
    farm monitoring system powered by solar energy. The \nproposed solution consists\
    \ of two parts, a hardware part and a \nlogicielle.la hardware part consists of\
    \ a transmitter node that \ncontains the pH, soil moisture, temperature, humidity,\
    \ and \nmotion sensor connected to ESP32 and a solar panel and \nbattery to supply\
    \ our system with electrical energy. The \nsoftware part consists of a mobile\
    \ application that allows \nfarmers to monitor their agricultural environment\
    \ as long as it \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science\
    \ and Applications, \nVol. 13, No. 5, 2022 \n375 | P a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org\
    \ \nis connected to the internet. The method of data acquisition is \nillustrated\
    \ in Fig. 9. The pH, soil moisture, temperature, \nhumidity, and motion sensors\
    \ send digital data to the ESP32. \nThis data will be transmitted to the cloud\
    \ server via WIFI \ncommunication. When there is incoming data on the cloud \n\
    server, farmers can monitor their farming environment via a \nmobile app. \n \n\
    Fig. 9. New System. \nD. Tools and Libraries used \nIn this paper we used several\
    \ software and libraries to \nimplement our new farm monitoring system: \n1) Arduino:\
    \ \nThe \nArduino \nintegrated \ndevelopment \nenvironment is a cross-platform\
    \ application for Windows, \nMacos, and Linux that is written in C and C++ functions.\
    \ It is \nused to write and download programs to Arduino-compatible \nboards.\
    \ The EDI source code is released under the GNU \nGeneral Public License, version\
    \ 2. The IDE environment \ncontains mainly two basic parts: the editor and the\
    \ compiler \nwhere the old one is used to write the required code and later is\
    \ \nused to compile and download the code in the given Arduino \nmodule. \n2)\
    \ Libraries: The Arduino IDE can be extended using \nlibraries, just like most\
    \ programming platforms. Libraries offer \nadditional features, such as working\
    \ with hardware or \nmanipulating data. The standard libraries used are described\
    \ \nbelow. \na) DHT.h: To read the data from the DHT sensor, we \nwill use Adafruit's\
    \ DHT.h library. To use this library, we must \nalso install the Adafruit Unified\
    \ Sensor library. \nb) WiFi.h: This library allows our esp32 card to connect \n\
    to the Wi-Fi network to start sending and receiving data. \n3) Algorithms and\
    \ flowchart: This section presents the \nalgorithms and flowchart of the overall\
    \ process of our new \nSmart Farm System: \na) Algorithms: \nGeneric \nprocess\
    \ \nalgorithm \nfor \ntemperature, humidity, soil moisture and pH sensors. \n\
    STEP 1: start the process; \nSTEP 2: connected to wifi; \nSTEP 3: read temperature,\
    \ humidity, soil and ph; \nSTEP 4: get temperature, humidity, soil and ph values\
    \ from \nanalog pins; \nSTEP 5: send data to cloud; \nSTEP 6: delay to 10 seconds;\
    \ \nSTEP 7: repeat step 4, 5 & 6 until the process end; \nSTEP 8: end; \nb) Flowchart:\
    \ Generic process flowchart for pir sensor \nmotion sensor (Fig. 10). \n \nFig.\
    \ 10. Flowchart (Pir Sensor). \nE. Mobile Application \nIn creating our app, we\
    \ used the blynk platform that \nsupports \nAndroid. \nIt \nworks \nwith \nseveral\
    \ \ntypes \nof \nmicrocontrollers such as Arduino, Raspberry and ESP32. It \n\
    consists of three main components: \n The blynk app that allows you to control\
    \ a device and \nview data. \n The blynk server, which is a cloud service responsible\
    \ \nfor all communications between objects and the \nsmartphone. \n Blynk libraries,\
    \ which include various widgets such as \ncontrol buttons, display formats, and\
    \ notifications. \nWhen creating our application, as shown in Fig. 11, we \ntried\
    \ to make it very simple, with a single interface that shows \nthe main information\
    \ collected by our ESP32. This application \nimmediately requests real-time information\
    \ from the cloud to \ndisplay it. \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced\

    www.ijacsa.thesai.org \n \nFig. 11. Mobile App. \nF. System Test \nWe tested the\
    \ consumption of the solar power of our new \nmodel for seven days. Using the\
    \ display screen of our new \nmodel shown in Fig. 12, we noticed that with the\
    \ equipment \nused for four days, the consumption of our battery does not \nexceed\
    \ 26%. \n \nFig. 12. Test. \nV. CONCLUSION AND PERSPECTIVES \nIn this article,\
    \ a new smart farm monitoring model was \nrealized. To propose this model, we\
    \ started by studying the \nwork already done in the field of smart agriculture,\
    \ the analysis \nof the data allowed us to raise three major questions: The \n\
    energy sources to power the equipment, the technologies used \nto interconnect\
    \ these objects and the security of agricultural \nfields against intrusions.\
    \ The tests we carried out for our new \nagricultural field monitoring system\
    \ were positive, using new \ndevices and sensors for example (PIR sensor). \n\
    The prospects of our project are to test our new model in a \nlarge agricultural\
    \ field to study the autonomy of the batteries \nconnected to the solar panels\
    \ and propose improvements to our \nnew system. \nREFERENCES \n[1] H.-T. Hsu,\

    Water is becoming scarcer. The unmonitored control and the extensive use of fossil
    fuel in water-table pumping for irrigation exacerbate global warming and harm
    the environment. Along with the rapid population growth and the concomitant increase
    in the demand for food, optimal usage of water-table and energy is becoming a
    must and indispensable for sustainable agriculture. In this context, Smart Agriculture
    (SA) is emerging as a promising field that leverages ICT (Information and Communication
    Technology) to optimize resources’ usage while enhancing crops’ yields. In this
    paper, we present an integral SA solution that leverages cost-effectiveness .
    Commercial solutions are costly and thus become impossible to adopt by small and
    medium farmers. Our solution revolves around three main axes: 1. Smart Water Metering
    promotes optimal usage and conservation of water-table (a.k.a., groundwater) via
    real-time data collection and monitoring using a Cloud-based IoT (Internet of
    Things) system; 2. Renewable-Energy integration promotes energy-efficient agriculture
    by reducing reliance on fossil fuels in water-table pumping, and 3. Smart Irrigation
    to promote good crops quality and quantity without harming the soil and the water-table
    ecosystems. Our solution has been deployed and tested in a real-world Smart Farm
    testbed. The results have shown that the adoption of our SA system reduces the
    amount of water consumption (with a traditional irrigation system) up to 71.8%.
    Finally, our solution is open-source and can be easily adopted and adapted by
    other researchers to promote the setting of a dedicated Cloud-based platform for
    water-table usage, especially in arid and sub-Saharan countries. IoT Based Smart

    basis and the main engine of life on earth. Humans use water for industrial purposes,
    sanitation, and irrigation. In the last decades, the annual water withdrawal ranged
    between 11 billion and 15 billion cubic meters per year, out of which 69 % is
    used in agriculture [1]. Unfortunately, most of this water is wasted because of
    inadequate irrigation control systems. As in most arid and sub-Saharan countries,
    agriculture in Morocco is the largest consumer of fresh water, especially after
    launching the Green Plan program in April 2008 [2]. This program aims to promote
    agriculture as an efficient sector capable of advancing the economy, fighting
    poverty, and preserving many people in rural areas efficiently and sustainably.
    Within the framework of this program, the government provided many facilities
    and assistance to farmers and investors in irrigated agriculture to provide enough
    basic food for local consumption and export promotion programs. However, the level
    of Smart Agriculture penetration in Morocco remains very low. In addition, investors
    in the irrigated agricultural projects started sounding alarms of severe depletion
    of groundwater on the horizon [3] and the lack of a cost-effective real-time data
    collection in irrigation systems in farming fields that will enable them to benefit
    from the advanced modern technologies. There is a need to develop a cost-effective
    and sustainable data acquisition system for smart agriculture applications in
    sub-Saharan fields for sustainable, efficient, and smart agriculture. The system
    should use renewable energy and the latest Information and Communication Technologies
    (ICT) that can sustain the aridity of an agricultural environment. When combined
    with reasonable control and management and data analytics, the data acquisition
    system can play an essential role in increasing agricultural productivity and
    improving the quality of crops. Most importantly, unlike the traditional methods
    of irrigated agriculture that widely use underground water reservoirs and resort
    to fossil fuels, especially gas, as a source of energy. Smart agriculture (SA)
    exploits modern management systems to rationalize water consumption and adopt
    renewable energies as a source of energy, thus rendering the agricultural sector
    eco-friendly. In this paper, we are presenting an integral and cost-effective
    SA solution. When approached from a Cyber-Physical System (CPS) perspective [4],
    our solution relies on four main ICTs: 1. A Wireless Sensors Network (WSNs) monitor,
    in real-time, the plant environmental conditions, e.g., weather and soil conditions,
    2. A Wireless Actuators Network (WAN) acts upon electric appliances such as water
    pumps and light bulbs, 3. A Cloud-based IoT platform for real-time data storage,
    processing, and visualization; and 4. A Fuzzy Logic Control module decides on
    monitoring irrigation durations based on the real-time acquired differences between
    desired and ambient soil moisture. We deployed our open-source software solution
    for data acquisition, actuation, and control. We built our cost-effective sensors
    and actuators using off-the-shelf cheap nano-Arduinos. Finally, we leveraged an
    existing free Cloud-based IoT platform, e.g., NodeRED [5]. In this paper, and
    by considering optimal water-ground usage, renewable energy integration, and open-source
    ICT-based smart irrigation, we aim to contribute towards the smooth penetration
    of Smart Agriculture into underprivileged sub-Saharan countries. We are further
    envisioning, through this work, to set a solid cornerstone for establishing a
    dedicated Cloud-based and HPC (High-Performance Computing) platform [6] to collect
    real-time data about water-table usage. This data, which falls under the big data
    category, as it bears the big data 3Vs (Volume, Velocity, and Variety) [7], and
    along with appropriate Big Data Analytics tools, will tremendously assist in promoting
    eco-friendly smart agriculture. The paper contributions are as follows: We present
    a real-world, cost-effective, and easy-to-deploy general architecture for a Smart
    Farm testbed that the research community can easily adopt and adapt for further
    testing and improvement. We detail how to use open-source software and leverage
    Cloud Computing for wireless sensor data storage and processing. We demonstrate
    the integration of our developed cost-effective wireless sensors and actuators
    using off-the-shelf hardware in a real-world case study. We show how integrating
    renewable energy into smart farms paves the path towards adopting our solution
    in off-grid sites, e.g., arid and sub-Saharan areas. We prove that by adopting
    fuzzy logic into smart drip irrigation, our system reduces water consumption by
    up to 71.8%, thus contributing to sustainable water-table usage. The rest of the
    paper is organized as follows. The background is presented in Section 2, and the
    related work is overviewed in Section 3. The general system architecture and design
    are described in Section 4. In Section 5, we discuss the results and evaluate
    the findings. Finally, in Section 6, we conclude and present our future work.
    SECTION II. Background A. Smart Agriculture as a Cyber-Physical System The rapid
    technological developments of the Internet of Things (IoT), WSN, and Embedded
    Systems in recent years have enabled the development of modern systems and applications
    that have completely changed our lives. CPSs are among the most powerful of these
    modern systems, and Smart Agriculture is a CPS. CPS refers to systems that ideally
    integrate software and hardware components to perform precise tasks. A formal
    definition states: “Cyber-Physical System is defined as transformative technologies
    for managing interconnected systems between its physical assets and computational
    capabilities” [8]. As shown in Fig. 1, the general CPS architecture combines embedded
    computing, wireless sensors, and actuators networks to monitor and control the
    physical environment and give it the ability to adapt itself to new conditions
    in real-time through feedback loops. Its ability to combine different technologies
    and make them integrated has made CPS a crucial technological revolution that
    brings innovation to multiple industries by replacing traditional processes in
    many application areas with new and modern ones. FIGURE 1. Cyber-physical systems
    (CPS) general architecture. Show All Smart agriculture is one of the most promising
    CPS applications that will positively affect human life. SA can preserve a significant
    amount of water and energy through its ability to monitor multiple resources such
    as irrigation and solar energy systems. As a CPS, it replaces the traditional
    agricultural system with a smart and modern one that provides accurate agricultural
    management by collecting and processing data related to the plant, the weather,
    and the soil, in real-time mode and using precise control methods. The interaction
    of the main components of SA as a closed-loop control CPS is depicted in Fig.
    2. This figure includes the field, the control center, the Wireless Sensors and
    Actuators Network (WSAN), and the drip irrigation system. FIGURE 2. Smart farm
    as a closed CPS (Cyber physical system). Show All B. Wireless Sensor Networks
    (WSN) The rapid developments in wireless communication technologies, micro-electromechanical
    systems, and digital electronics have given rise to WSN [9]–[11]. The latter consists
    of sensor nodes that monitor the agricultural environment needed data, such as
    temperature, humidity, soil moisture, motion, and pressure, and send through a
    gateway towards the data processing server(s). This data can be hosted locally
    or remotely in the Cloud [12]. Once processed and analyzed, it becomes information
    that can be visualized (e.g., using plots and charts) and sent to the control
    unit to react upon and take actions, e.g., switching On/Off water pumps and drip
    irrigation motors. One of the main advantages of WSN is that it reduces the cost
    of wiring and makes it practical and easy. According to some studies, WSN will
    have the ability to eliminate from 20% to 80% of the installation costs [13].
    The general structure of a wireless sensor node is depicted in Fig. 3 and consists
    of four units [14]: The Sensing Unit consists of sensor modules that sample the
    environmental conditions of the deployment field. The Processing Unit consists
    of a microcontroller with a CPU and memory to run code and process the data. The
    Transmission Unit: This unit modulates digital data and sends it wirelessly. Several
    wireless technologies are adopted for this unit. In our deployment, we are using
    ZigBee [15]. The power Supply Unit is the Lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery that powers
    the wireless sensor node. FIGURE 3. General architecture of a wireless sensor
    node. Show All C. Internet of Things (IoT) With the rapid advancement in ICT,
    today’s era has left the concept of the internet far behind, and a new concept
    has emerged: the IoT. There are many definitions of IoT set by many organizations
    working globally. ITU-T (International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication
    Standardization Sector) has defined IoT as “Global infrastructure for Information
    Society, enabling advanced services by interconnecting (physical and virtual)
    things based on existing and evolving, interoperable information and communication
    technologies” [13]. [16] defines IoT as a technology that combines the internet
    and existing resources to control devices. This control is ensured by using various
    IoT communication technologies such as Bluetooth, ZigBee, Long-Range (Lora), Zensys
    Wave (Z-Wave), SigFox, Wi-Fi, GPRS, 4G, and 5G [17]. Even though IoT is mainly
    about connecting and automating things (objects) over the internet, human intervention
    gives this concept the possibility of existence. The interrelationship between
    the three sections that make up the IoT is illustrated in Fig. 4. FIGURE 4. Tri-sectional
    relationship between the three components of IoT. Show All IoT is witnessing continuous
    progress and has a promising future. Statistics indicate that the number of IoT-connected
    devices is expected to rise to 43 billion devices by 2023 [18]. Furthermore, the
    total IoT market worldwide was worth around \\(389 billion in 2020, and it is
    expected to rise to more than one trillion US dollars in 2030 [19]. This optimistic
    future vision reinforces the necessity to develop newer communication technologies
    that enable the synchronization of the largest possible number of new devices
    with sensors over the internet. Fig. 5 shows the persistent increase in connected
    devices/things over the internet for ten years (2015-2025) [20]. FIGURE 5. IoT
    connected devices in 2015-2025. Show All Given that IoT is a fertile research
    area that both the academic and industry sectors are interested in, all indications
    show an urge to deploy novel technologies to cope with the rapid increase in IoT
    deployment and adoption. In this regard, 5G and its Massive Machine Type Communication
    (mMTC) component is excellent news for the IoT market, and it will have a significant
    impact on it [19]. Through mMTC, 5G networks will inevitably improve the reliability
    and performance of many vital ICT-related domains of substantial interest to society,
    such as smart mobility, smart grid, smart buildings, and smart agriculture. The
    following section presents some critical IoT applications in SA. D. IoT Applications
    in Smart Agriculture IoT and connected objects have invaded our daily lives in
    all fields, from smart TVs to connected cars: all our activities are facilitated
    by these new tools, which significantly increase our comfort. All studies confirm
    that the potential of connected things is enormous. For example, a study done
    by Fortune Business Insight indicates that the global IoT market size is projected
    to reach $ 1,854.76 billion by 2028. It is set to exhibit a Compound Annual Growth
    Rate (CAGR) of 25.4% during the forecast period between 2021 and 2028 [21]. The
    applications of IoT are numerous and cover many areas. The most appealing IoT
    applications in Agriculture are presented next. 1) Smart Greenhouses Greenhouse
    farming enhances the quality and quantity of crops production through manual control
    of environmental conditions [22]. A smart greenhouse can be created using IoT
    by deploying sensors and motors that intelligently monitor and control the climate
    conditions based on the needs of the plants [23]. Several operations will be automatic
    by adopting this innovative agricultural system, such as opening and closing windows,
    adjusting the cooling and heating system, and turning on/off light bulbs. Thus,
    manual intervention is no longer required. 2) Smart Irrigation Management The
    currently adopted irrigation methods are somewhat advanced and depend on watering
    at specific times, which does not require much human intervention. Still, at the
    same time, it involves a high degree of guesswork and can be very wasteful in
    terms of water and energy consumption. Some field parts are under or over irrigated
    even with modern irrigation systems. Besides, although farmers would stop irrigation
    systems when expected to rain, sometimes they do not check the weather to adjust
    their schedules accordingly. The smart irrigation management system can consider
    all of this by using precision farming methodologies and IoT-enabled sensors that
    monitor soil moisture levels, humidity, and temperature everywhere in the field.
    The control based on this data automatically adjusts irrigation schedules. It
    also provides the exact amount of water where and when needed to create optimal
    conditions for the plant for a better yield without wasting water and energy.
    3) Integration Into Smart Grid Renewable energy integration into Smart Agriculture
    would serve as a bias to link Smart Farms to Smart Grids (SG) [17]. Smart farms
    are both energy producers and consumers. An SG is an electricity distribution
    network that promotes the flow of information between suppliers and consumers
    to adjust the flow of electricity in real-time and allows more efficient management
    of the electricity network [24], [25]. Smart grid benefits from the significant
    development that IoT and embedded systems are witnessing to optimize energy production,
    distribution, consumption, and storage. It improves the energy efficiency of the
    assembly by minimizing line losses and optimizing the yield of the means of production
    used, taking into consideration the real-time consumption. E. Cloud-Based Big
    Data Analytics Platforms This study uses Node-RED, an open-source flow-based programming
    tool that allows wiring hardware devices, application programming interfaces (APIs),
    and online services. We used the built-JavaScript-based library on Node.js to
    develop the application. We wired pre-programmed nodes represented by appropriate
    icons and created the application’s different needed functional IoT components.
    Node-RED contains several node types, each of which has a specific function. For
    instance, the debug-out nodes are used to monitor the flow. The inject nodes trigger
    a flow manually by clicking on it or automatically at regular intervals. The function
    nodes allow JavaScript code to be run on the messages passed through it. Furthermore,
    dashboard nodes allow us to display data [26]. In this work, we wired up input,
    output, and processing nodes to create needed flows for data preprocessing, processing,
    storage, and controlling the water pumps and the lighting system, as well as sending
    alerts. The deployed Node-Red flow construction of our irrigation control system
    is depicted in Fig. 6. FIGURE 6. NodeRED irrigation control flow construction.
    Show All SECTION III. Related Work Several studies have been carried out in Smart
    Agriculture (SA). Authors in [27] covered state of the art in SA systems from
    a big data perspective. Their work aimed at introducing big data processing into
    SA. Besides, the authors presented a detailed evolution of the different agricultural
    systems was presented. It showed that SA could explore the full potential of information
    communication technology (ICT) by using various data sources. In [28], D. Glaroudis
    et al. provided a detailed survey about the most used messaging protocols in IoT
    applications. Based on the up-to-date references, they introduced, analyzed, and
    compared six protocols: Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP), Message Queuing
    Telemetry Transport (MQTT), Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), Extensible
    Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP), WebSocket, and Data Distribution Service
    (DDS). The performance comparison was based on throughput, latency, power consumption,
    bandwidth, reliability, and security. The main challenges that are and will be
    raised by SA applications were also presented in this paper to provide a solid
    basis for realistic implementation options for SA applications. Authors in [29]
    highlighted the importance of IoT and WSN in precision agriculture. The development
    of a low-cost system that monitors, controls, and makes decisions, was presented.
    According to the results, the deployed system showed meaningful improvement in
    the efficiency of resources usage and crops production. Another model of a low-cost,
    effective irrigation system for enhancing cotton production using wireless sensors
    was proposed in [30]. The proposed wireless sensor showed excellent efficiency
    in monitoring the soil water tension, thus implementing an effective irrigation
    scheduling protocol. Authors in [31] deployed small-sized and low-cost WSN nodes
    to improve potato yield by monitoring the field. This study presented a model
    for irrigation management based on mathematical estimations of the agricultural
    parameters. The obtained results ensure better crop yield quality even under stressful
    environmental conditions. Besides, the irrigation system efficiency showed an
    increase that goes up to 10%. In [32], the authors concluded that environmental
    conditions monitoring is crucial to increasing agricultural yield. In this direction,
    a smart system was deployed to monitor soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and
    the movement of animals in the field. The system used Arduino-based sensors. Besides,
    the suggested system deployed an Android mobile application that schedules the
    irrigation, visualizes real-time data, and alerts the farmer in case of any discrepancy.
    The IoT-based SA system farmer-friendly, which is an intelligent system for monitoring
    the concentration of nitrates in groundwater without human intervention, has been
    established in [33]. The proposed approach was based on WSN using Wi-Fi and LoRa
    for data communication. The results demonstrated that the model is ambitious and
    can be adopted by the farmers on large scales. The authors in [34] performed an
    experimental comparison of IoT devices with solar energy harvesting. For the sake
    of the comparison, they used three different communication technologies: Wi-Fi,
    LoRaWan, and ZigBee. The results proved that LoRaWan was the best solution for
    agricultural monitoring when prioritizing network lifetime. The research work
    in [35] defined SA as the application of modern ICT into agriculture. They presented
    the usable IoT hardware and software for smart agriculture and shared interesting
    results. A practical solution for sustainable irrigation in hyper-arid regions
    was proposed in [36]. The suggested solution is based on fuzzy logic combined
    with WSN. According to the results, vast amounts of water and energy were saved
    through effective irrigation scheduling and management processes. For environmental
    sustainability, authors in [37] developed a system that retrieves real-time data
    and uses it to accurately determine the amount of water needed to irrigate the
    garden. The results of this real-world prototype showed savings between 26% and
    34% in water consumption. Still, the results depend on whether the temperature
    sensor is used alone or humidity and soil moisture sensors. Similar to Industry
    4.0 [38], “Agri-Food 4.0” was introduced in [39]. Inspired by the concept of “agriculture
    4.0”, it aims to meet the challenge of enhancing the performance of the agricultural
    supply chain using efficient and effective methods and procedures. The authors
    have conducted a comparative analysis of more than 100 research papers on the
    new technologies and the latest available supply chain approaches. This analysis
    aims to prospect the future of Agri-Food and answer the relevant outstanding questions,
    e.g., how Agri-Food can better support supply chain decision-making? Escamilla-García
    et al. in [40] proposed the use of artificial neural networks (ANNs) in precision
    agriculture. According to the authors, these models can be developed to adapt
    to new technologies such as IoT, Big Data, and Machine Learning (ML) and eventually
    improve the agriculture field. The feedforward architecture is predominant in
    most of the works analyzed in this paper, while the recurrent and hybrid neural
    networks are less used. The benefits and shortcomings of using ANNs in different
    greenhouses applications such as microclimate prediction, control of carbon dioxide,
    and energy expenses are also featured. In [41], the authors proposed Agrinex,
    a modern irrigation mechanism that helps preserve resources by using WSAN. This
    mechanism can be an alternative to the traditional methods used to control agricultural
    irrigation. Agrinex is based on a mesh network consisting of nodes distributed
    in the field and act simultaneously as sensors detecting soil moisture, temperature,
    and humidity. Some nodes of the mesh network act as actuators that control the
    valves of the drip irrigation system. The results show that Agrinex is a promising
    start for many other WSAN applications in the agricultural sector. A GSM-based
    smart irrigation system was presented in [42]. GSM was used to communicate environmental
    data such as the soil moisture, the temperature in the field, the solar power
    data, and the status of the water pumps. Fuzzy Logic control has been exploited
    in this study to take input from sensors (soil moisture, temperature, and humidity)
    and decide on the water pump status as output. This system has several advantages.
    The most important ones are the availability of a mobile application to remotely
    monitor the irrigation system and its ability to switch Off the water pumps when
    expected to rain. Compared to manual flooding, the results showed that this smart
    system proved its efficiency in conserving water and energy. A system that relies
    on solar energy to cope with water and energy shortages was developed in [43].
    This system uses Wi-Fi technology to provide the control unit with data related
    to the soil and the weather in the field where they are deployed to decide whether
    to send a switch On command to the pumps to irrigate the area or not. Besides,
    the designed controller monitors the water level in the well and operates in three
    different modes: manual mode, mobile control mode, and fuzzy logic control mode.
    The developed prototype solely relied on solar energy. Moreover, it successfully
    proved its efficiency in providing the appropriate conditions for the plants without
    wasting water and energy. In [44], Y. P. Lin et. argue that the next step in the
    evolution in Smart Agriculture will consist of blockchain usage. They proposed
    an ICT e-agriculture system using blockchain infrastructure. SECTION IV. System
    Architecture and Design Our proposed system consists of seven main elements, see
    Fig. 7: Data Acquisition: It is a Wireless Sensor Network that senses the environment
    data and sends it to the gateway [45]. Big Data Analytics Platform (BDAP): The
    unit responsible for data storage, visualization, and processing. In addition
    to that, this platform controls the drip irrigation and lighting system within
    the farm. We deployed this component using a Raspberry Pi along with Node-Red.
    The latter is a local server containing a control unit running algorithms to decide
    whether to pump water from groundwater to basin via water pump #1 or from basin
    to the drip irrigation system via water pump # Wireless Actuator Network (WAN):
    It consists of actuators carrying out decisions issued by the BDAP by switching
    On/Off the water pumps and the lighting bulbs. The actuators are wirelessly connected
    to the BDAP [46]. Renewable Energy: These are solar panels that constitute the
    renewable power source for the farm and battery. Storage Unit: The element responsible
    for storing extra electrical energy produced by the solar panels and reusing it
    when needed to operate the water pumps and lighting. It consists of a Lithium
    battery. Control Unit: It decides whether to forward the produced electricity
    to the Smart Farm or store it in the batteries for future use. Cluster Controller:
    It is responsible for collecting and filtering data related to the smart grid
    and sending it to the Cloud-based IoT platform in real-time mode [47]. FIGURE
    7. IoT based smart agriculture: Testbed general architecture. Show All Our proposed
    system is meant to cope with the rapidly growing need for water-table by controlling
    water pumping, overcoming the shortage in electricity by integrating renewable
    energy, and promoting rational usage of water by regulating drip irrigation. The
    following sections shed further light on the main functionalities of our system.
    A. Data Acquisition The data acquisition is composed of wireless sensors and actuators.
    As depicted in Fig. 8, a sensor node is composed of three elements: Sensor modules:
    soil moisture sensor deployed in the field, temperature, and humidity sensor (DHT11)
    which measures the ambient air temperature and humidity, PIR sensor which detects
    the existence of humans by sensing motion, and for the fields’ security reason,
    the fire sensor is used to detect the presence of a flame or fire, the Ultrasonic
    HC-SR04 sensor which measures the water level in the basin, and the AC sensor
    which measures pumps’ power consumption. Microcontroller: an Arduino Nano board
    that connects all the components is used in this study. Communication module:
    It is responsible for transceiving data between sensors and the BDAP. In this
    study Zigbee module (Xbee series 2 S2C) was used. FIGURE 8. Data flow: from sensors
    to the cloud. Show All In anticipation of any power failure in sunlight deficiency,
    all nodes are powered with an IoT solar system (solar panel 20W, solar battery
    charger, and 25Ah battery). This method makes the WSN data acquisition system
    ideal for agriculture as it can be easily deployed everywhere independently of
    the power installation. This energy harvesting system can guarantee up to 5 days
    of total autonomy for each sensor node. B. Sensor Node Configuration The WSN was
    implemented as a mesh topology using a scalable and reliable firmware named Digimesh.
    Each sensor node can act as a sensor and a router in this configuration using
    the Ad-hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol [10]. In the current
    study, five wireless sensor nodes were deployed. These send real-time data to
    the BDAP every 15 minutes through the gateway device (sink node) that connects
    the WSN and the BDAP, see Fig. 9. FIGURE 9. Wireless mesh network architecture.
    Show All The wireless actuator nodes we used to control the water pumps are smart
    relays (Sonoff with integrated ESP8266 Wi-Fi Card [48]). These are WiFi-based
    wireless smart switches that operate with a voltage range of 90-250v AC and a
    wireless frequency of 2.4GHz and are compatible with a wide range of appliances.
    We adopted this smart switch as it is cost-effective, reliable, and provides an
    integrated Wi-Fi module. In addition, ensuring communication with the BDAP as
    the Wi-Fi connection might not be available. We enhanced the data acquisition
    and control unit by replacing Sonoff’s smart relay module with a standard relay
    5V connected to an Arduino Nano microcontroller equipped with a GSM/GPRS module
    or a Zigbee module. Fig. 10. shows the wireless sensors used to collect data from
    the field, Fig. 11. shows the wireless sensors used to monitor the water level
    in the basin and the water pump’s energy consumption, and Fig. 12 shows the wireless
    actuator nodes that act on the water pumps to switch them On/Off. FIGURE 10. In-field
    wireless sensor node deployment. Show All FIGURE 11. Basin wireless sensor node
    deployment. Show All FIGURE 12. Wireless smart actuators nodes deployment. Show
    All C. Big Data Analytics Platform Big Data Analytics Platform (BDAP) is the backbone
    of the proposed system. The developed BDAP is based on Node-RED and tested locally
    on a RaspberryPi 3 board running Raspbian OS. Besides, we installed the message
    broker Eclipse-Mosquitto that implements the IoT publish-subscribe messaging protocol
    (MQTT). Following are the main functionalities of our BDAP. 1) Real-Time Data
    Collection and Storage The BDAP receives real-time data from three sources. DigiMesh
    sensors network is distributed in the field to collect and send data to the gateway.
    This data is then forwarded to the BDAP through the USB serial port. Wireless
    sensor/actuator nodes are deployed in groundwater sources and basins. They are
    connected to Wi-Fi using the ESP8266 module, and they communicate with BDAP using
    the MQTT communication protocol. OpenWeatherMap online forecasting portal: it
    provides up to 5 days forecast of temperature, humidity, wind speed, pressure,
    and precipitation. 2) Real-Time Data Visualisation The proposed BDAP contains
    a NodeRED dashboard that displays the acquired data from the different sources
    through a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI). The main characteristics
    of the GUI are: Visualizing data over short, medium, and long-term periods (daily,
    monthly, and yearly) in charts form. Allowing the user to remotely act on the
    pumps by switching them On/Off via graphical command buttons. Securing data access
    by prompting the user to authenticate through password-secured sessions. Fig.
    13 depicts the interactive real-time control GUI, which displays the real-time
    soil moisture average, temperature average, water level in the basin, irrigation
    duration, rain precipitation, and the state of water pumps (On/Off). The NodeRED
    dashboard was deployed using flowchart programming. FIGURE 13. Real-time control
    interface. Show All 3) Real-Time Irrigation and Water Level Control The control
    flow of the proposed smart irrigation system is presented in Fig. 14. It has two
    primary sequences: 1. Irrigation control (in green), and 2. water level control
    (in blue). FIGURE 14. Deployed system control-flow diagram. Show All a: Real-Time
    Irrigation Control We are adopting fuzzy logic in deploying this component, and
    we dubbed it the Fuzzy Irrigation Control Unit (FICU). The BDAP starts by retrieving
    predicted precipitation data for the next 24 hours from OpenWeatherMap. Depending
    on provided data, two cases are possible: If it is predicted to rain, the FICU
    decides to switch Off the basin waterpump #2 as the rain will likely irrigate
    the field. else, the FICU proceeds as follows: It retrieves the actual soil moisture
    and ambient temperature (Ta) from the wireless sensor nodes and computes their
    average values. The computed average soil moisture is compared to the desired
    one that varies depending on the plant type. In this study, the desired soil moisture
    is set to 60%. The FICU computes a new variable named Soil Moisture Difference
    (SMD). SMD is the difference between the real-time soil moisture average and the
    desired one. If SMD is ≤ 0, FICU uses SMD and Ta to generate the irrigation duration
    (Id) based on the rules mentioned in Table 1. For instance, “If SMD ≪<0 , and
    Ta is Cold, then Id is set to Short”. Then, waterpump #2 is turned On for Id minutes
    to irrigate the field. If SMD >0, the waterpump #2 is turned Off. TABLE 1 Fuzzy
    Rules of Irrigation Duration The use of Ta alongside SMD by FICU is meant to reduce
    water evapotranspiration at high temperatures. FICU comprises four components,
    see Fig. 15: 1. fuzzification module, 2. The Max-Min Inference Engine, 3. The
    Mamdani-type rule base module, and 4. The Centroid defuzzification module. FIGURE

    functions of the FICU are depicted in Fig. 16. The fuzzification/defuzzification
    of inputs/output is done using trapezoidal and triangular membership functions.
    FIGURE 16. Fuzzy sets memberships functions. Show All Only three membership functions
    were used for each input to improve the program execution speed and avoid the
    memory backlog [36]. However, five membership functions were used for the output
    to cover all variations of Id. b: Real-Time Water Level Control Drip irrigation
    using basins is the most used irrigation method in agriculture. This method has
    several advantages and drawbacks as well. Advantages: Collecting rainwater: by
    collecting rainwater, water table resources are saved, and energy use is reduced.
    Improving water quality: when water is kept in basins, it becomes more oxygenated,
    thus becoming more beneficial for the plants [49]. Drawbacks: Permanent supervision
    cost: This is the sole drawback. Conventional Water Level (WL) control requires
    permanent human supervision, increasing the cost of the products. Our BDAP monitors
    WL in basins based on real-time data provided by a WL sensor to minimize the additional
    cost due to supervision. The blue part in Fig. 14 shows the WL control flowchart.
    Once the field is watered, the BDAP checks the WL value of the basin. If WL <
    50 %, waterpump #1 is turned On. Then, water is pumped from the groundwater source
    to fill the basin to the maximum. Once at maximum, a switch Off command is sent
    to waterpump #1. The whole water irrigation and water level control process is
    regularly repeated (see Fig. 14). We fixed the cycle duration to one hour. The
    solar system used in this study is shown in Fig. 17. It consists of a DC/AC inverter,
    an AC/DC inverter, electrical protection, and a lithium battery. FIGURE 17. Solar
    system real-world deployment. Show All The real-world deployment of the proposed
    SA system is depicted in Fig. 18. The setup consists of solar panels, WSN, IoT
    solar panels with batteries and water pumps. FIGURE 18. Smart agriculture real-world
    deployment. Show All SECTION V. Results & Discussions In order to evaluate our
    system, real-time data was continuously collected remotely via the settled WSN
    over five days in July 2020. Collected data include soil moisture, temperature,
    irrigation duration, water level, solar panels energy production, and the energy
    consumption of waterpump #2. The relevant data variances are depicted in Figures
    19, 20, 21, 22, and 23. FIGURE 19. Real-time temperature and soil moisture averages.
    Show All FIGURE 20. Real-time soil moisture using the traditional irrigation system.

    All FIGURE 22. Real-time water level and groundwater pump state. Show All FIGURE
    23. Real-time PV power production and waterpump #2 energy consumption. Show All
    In Fig. 19, depicting the temperature and soil moisture variances, we notice that
    the day temperature rose to 40 °C, and the nocturnal temperature ranged between
    15 and 20 °C. Unlike conventional irrigation systems (depicted in Fig. 20), the
    soil moisture is optimal and closer to the desired value (60%), and it stays within
    the range of 57%-65%. In conventional irrigation systems, represented in Fig.
    20, the soil moisture varies from 0%-100%. In Fig. 20, we track the real-time
    soil moisture in traditional irrigation systems within five days. This method
    consists of irrigating the field for two consecutive hours daily. The results,
    in Fig. 20, underpin the following drawbacks: The plant is either over or under
    irrigated since the soil moisture varies between those extreme values, and the
    optimal value (60%) is not maintained for an extended period. The quality and
    quantity of the yield would be negatively affected since the soil moisture reaches
    0% for at least five hours each day. High water and energy consumption: in five
    days, 2400L were consumed, which is equivalent to 480L/day for an area of 25m2.
    The last average is used later to evaluate our system compared to conventional
    irrigation in the same region. Our proposed system reacts to weather changes with
    high precision. It raises the soil moisture to 65% during high temperatures (to
    avoid evapotranspiration losses) and does not exceed 62%-63% in low temperatures.
    To study the impact of the irrigation duration on soil moisture, we tracked the
    relevant variances as depicted in Fig. 21. Accordingly, whenever there is a decrease
    in soil moisture, the FICU computes the desired irrigation period to meet the
    desired moisture value and sends a switch On signal to the wireless actuator attached
    to waterpump #2. Accordingly, the higher the temperature is, the longer the irrigation
    duration becomes. When raising the irrigation periods, the evapotranspiration
    losses are reduced, and as a result, the desired soil moisture is continuously
    maintained. Thus, better conditions are provided to the plant, consequently increasing
    the yield’s quality and quantity. Monitoring and controlling the water level in
    the basin is crucial for controlling the drip irrigation system. In this experiment,
    we continuously track the basin water, which varies according to the irrigation
    periods computed by the FICU. For instance, as shown in Fig. 22, when the water
    level exceeds the set threshold (50% in our case), waterpump #1 is turned Off;
    otherwise, waterpump #1 is switched On until the basin is reached entirely complete.
    Thus, the obtained results are consistent with the water level control previously
    presented in section IV. We used a water pump with a water flow rate of 240 L/hour
    in our experiment. Within five days, the total Id was 169 minutes, and 676 L were
    consumed during this time. This rate is equivalent to 135.2 L/day consumed over
    the same area of 25 m2. Accordingly, our proposed smart agriculture system provides
    the field with an average of 54 m3/hectare per day. This water consumption is
    3.55 times lower than in the traditional irrigation system, and thus the energy
    consumption as well since used pumps are electrical ones. Therefore, we conclude
    that the traditional irrigation system is ineffective in maintaining soil moisture
    at the desired value. In addition, it is wasting water and energy resources. The
    real-time energy consumption of waterpump #2 measured by AC sensor and the real-time
    solar panels’ energy production measured by a smart energy meter within five days
    are presented in Fig. 23. We notice from this figure that the maximum energy consumption
    and maximum solar energy production are reached simultaneously (between 12:00
    pm and 4:00 pm). From this figure, we also conclude that the integration of solar
    energy is suitable for smart agriculture without implementing an extensive storage
    system(batteries). In the design of our SA prototype, the cost has been reduced
    to the minimum possible to make it affordable and widely adopted even by small
    and medium farmers. The unit price for every single component is presented in
    Table 2. TABLE 2 Unit Price of the Different Components The total cost of designing
    our SA Prototype with a RaspberryPi, five wireless sensor nodes, 5 IoT solar panels
    and batteries, two smart relays, and a Zigbee gateway is $ 609, which is much
    cheaper than other existing solutions in the market. The proposed SA system is
    an up-and-coming solution for many reasons: Better quantity and quality production.
    Less energy and water consumption. Cost-effectiveness. Open-source. Eco-friendly.
    Easy monitoring (less effort). Designed to promote scalability. SECTION VI. Conclusion
    This paper developed, presented, and deployed an open-source and easy-to-deploy
    smart agriculture system with the main drivers of cost-effectiveness, water consumption
    optimization, and renewable energy integration. The deployed SA system leverages
    up-to-date ICT. We used IoT devices for data acquisition and control (sensors
    and actuators). We also used Cloud Computing for data processing, visualization,
    and data storage. Besides, we recurred to fuzzy logic to implement a fuzzy irrigation
    control unit that decides on the appropriate Id (Irrigation Duration) based on
    real-time processed data. This approach saves water and energy and provides adequate
    conditions for the plants, thus optimizing crops’ yield. Furthermore, this allows
    better monitoring for the water level in the basin and adheres to the conventional
    eco-friendly trend of sustainable agriculture through its total reliance on solar
    energy. The case study results show that our proposed solution is promising compared
    to the traditional irrigation system due to its cost-effectiveness and ability
    to reduce water/energy consumption by 71.8%. As future work, we are paving the
    way towards scaling up our system by deploying our solution in several farms in
    the region, allowing our BDAP (Big Data Analytics Platform) to collect big real-time
    data about water-table usage in the region. Thus appropriate irrigation strategies
    can be derived and analyzed. Besides, we plan further experimentation to enhance
    solar energy production and storage. We will also integrate LoRa wireless sensors/actuators
    network and develop a machine learning system that predicts soil moisture, energy
    production, and energy consumption within a few days. The machine learning algorithm
    can adapt to different crop requirements in moisture levels and improve crop yield.

    Publisher: IEEE Introduction Nowadays, the Internet of Things (IoT) has already
    left the state of an idea and has been applied in practical projects. The technical
    and application challenges are enormous since IoT platforms enable complex real-time
    control systems that combine the use of communication infrastructure, hardware,
    software, analytical techniques, and application knowledge combined into multiple
    layers. One of the key technical challenges is to realize the expected IoT impacts
    on systems, as IoT allows them to become service mashups, connecting things as
    services. Consequently, system development will become dynamic plug-and-play interoperable
    service composition, and system logic will become service orchestration. Overall,
    IoT allows solution flexibility to fulfill custom application needs. In the context
    of agriculture, irrigation is a key task to guarantee adequate crop yield by avoiding
    under- and over-watering. Moreover, it is an important cost driver, as the energy
    to transport water and to operate irrigation equipment is costly – in some places,
    even the water itself is costly. Smart irrigation seeks to apply IoT and analytical
    methods to leverage precision irrigation, aiming optimal cost effectiveness to
    the farmer by flowing the water in the proper amount to places where and when
    it is needed. In this article we introduce the concept of a flexible IoT-machine
    learning (ML) platform, wherein IoT and ML components are connected as services
    in an application context, allowing adaptable solutions to fulfill application
    needs. This approach benefits IoT professionals, as they can easily develop and
    deploy complex solutions involving devices, communication, data management, analytics,
    and application elements. In particular, our work on this concept has resulted
    in a platform called SWAMP1 that implements our flexible IoT-ML architecture toward
    the smart irrigation problem. This allows highly customizable soil water management
    solutions, involving flexible connectivity among data, physical models, and ML
    algorithms oriented to solve application key tasks, such as water need estimation
    and irrigation planning and operation. We call this concept flexible data-driven
    soil water management, which in practice allows suitable solutions to a great
    variety of soil, plant, and regional weather characteristics. This approach benefits
    the farmer, as a highly customizable smart irrigation solution may reduce water
    and energy usage and mitigate crop yield risks as it keeps soil water content
    at healthy levels for plants. In the remainder of this article, we compare our
    approach to other practical IoT research projects, provide details on our flexible
    platform applied to precision irrigation, describe our flexible ML approach to
    address precision irrigation tasks, highlight the potential impacts of our approach
    to IoT professionals and farmers, and summarize our main contributions. Related
    Work In recent years, different academic and commercial initiatives have emerged,
    aiming to incorporate IoT and ML into the agriculture. IoF2020 (www.iof2020.eu)2
    and Dragon (www.data-dragon.eu) are two projects funded by the European Union
    for developing IoT platforms for agrifood. IoF2020 is organized into five sectors
    that adopt different solutions: arable crops, dairy, vegetables, fruits, and meat.
    Arable crops use sensors to monitor production and intelligent analysis of images
    to assess crop development. GPS data from cattle neck collars or livestock movements
    monitor dairy chain, and ML is used for early lameness detection. IoT devices
    track the production chain of vegetables, fruits, and meat. Dragon aims to integrate
    IoT data with phenomics, genomics, and metagenomics data associated with ML methods
    to increase production. Other recent academic studies include a platform for precision
    agriculture and experimentation in turmeric cultivation [1]. The platform provides
    a graphical interface for connecting sensors and actuators and uses analytical
    methods to analyze the delay of messages. Another study uses thermal images generated
    by drones and transmitted throughout a cloud-fog system to identify non-uniform
    irrigation zones [2]. Commercial companies are also putting some of these ideas
    into the market. Examples include Agrosmart (www.agrosmart.com.br) in Brazil,
    Agricolus (www.agricolus.com) in Italy, and Cropmetrics (www.cropmetrics.com)
    in the United States. Among other technologies, they use soil sensors, weather
    stations, and weather forecasts for irrigation advising. However, their underlying
    approaches for water need estimation and irrigation optimization and operation
    are not available. Despite the richness of recent approaches adopting IoT in the
    agri-food chain, they do not yet fully explore: (a) the architectural aspects
    to hold flexible solutions involving IoT and ML components and (b) the potential
    of the collected data for a more accurate analysis of water needs. In this article,
    we advocate that data-intensive methods provided by ML algorithms, in combination
    with IoT technologies and weather-soil-atmosphere simulations, can provide a considerable
    impact in precision irrigation and its solution deployment. A Flexible IoT-ML
    Platform for Smart Irrigation The success of next generation systems for precision
    irrigation based on IoT technologies coupled with intelligent ML data processing
    techniques depends on the ability of the solution to adapt to different contexts
    found in farms. A flexible IoT-ML platform must allow different deployment configurations
    of hardware, software, and communication technologies, customized to deal with
    the requirements and constraints of different settings, countries, climate, soils,
    and crops. Here we advocate that an IoT-ML infrastructure for providing smart
    irrigation services be defined by two complementary dimensions, namely core components
    and deployment locations. Core components are a set of software, hardware, and
    communication technologies, such as soil moisture sensor probes, long-range WAN
    (LoRaWAN) [3], Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) [4], LoRa Server (www.loraserver.io),
    FIWARE [5], and SEPA [6], as well as specific services for water need estimation
    and irrigation planning and operation. On the other hand, deployment locations
    define where core components can be placed, and how they communicate with each
    other. This generates distinctive configuration scenarios for different deployments.
    Locations follow an IoT computing continuum, composed of things (sensors and actuators),
    mist (field nodes such as radio gateways), fog (farm on-premise computing infrastructure),
    cloud (data storage and processing), and terminal (a smartphone, tablet, or laptop
    where the end user interacts with the application). The five instances of this
    continuum define the end-to-end information path starting with data collected
    by sensors up to commands executed by actuators. The five instances might not
    necessarily be present in all scenarios. Rather, depending on farm characteristics,
    requirements, and constraints, fog or cloud may not be present. This feature provides
    additional flexibility to the IoT-ML platform, as the differences are understood,
    and the platform adapts to the farm and not the opposite. Figure 1 depicts the
    IoT infrastructure for providing smart irrigation services, composed of core components
    and deployment locations. In smart agriculture, each farm has particular objectives
    and characteristics, so different deployment configurations may be used, representing
    instances of the same platform. Figure 1 presents a simpler version of the deployment
    of the IoT-ML platform where locations are thing, mist, cloud, and terminal (i.e.,
    no fog is used). This configuration was chosen for simplicity and a farmer''s
    choice of not hosting anyon-premises infrastructure. Figure 1. IoT-ML platform
    overview and end-to-end data path for a smart irrigation scenario. Show All In
    Fig. 1, the numbers in blue circles represent a simplified sequence of the end-to-end
    data flow through this deployment of the IoT-ML platform. Soil moisture sensors
    send data via LoRaWAN to the gateway installed in the mist node. Particularly
    for the SWAMP Project, we have built a custom-made three-depth soil moisture sensor,
    but also use commercial sensors from Libelium (www.libelium.com) and Meter (www.metergroup.com).
    A weather station also sends data to the mist node via a serial wired interface
    (1). From there, the mist node forwards data via 4G through the Internet directly
    to the cloud (2). Within the cloud, sensor data are treated by the LoRaWAN server
    and sent to the IoT protocol translator (3), such as a FIWARE IoT Agent. Weather
    data goes directly to the IoT protocol translator using the Ultralight 2.0 protocol,
    as well as weather forecasts obtained from an external service. The Translator
    converts the three different types of input data – soil, weather conditions, and
    weather forecast – into the format of the particular IoT underlying platform transmitting
    them to the context broker (4) (e.g., NGSI JSON format for FIWARE Orion). Once
    data arrives at the context broker, it is forwarded to time series storage (5)
    that makes it available for further processing (e.g., FIWARE QuantumLeap using
    CrateDB), where the first part of the end-to-end data flow ends. Here, depending
    on the volume and velocity of data, the time series storage may be replaced by
    a distributed data pipeline (e.g., Apache Kafka) connected to a big data processing
    system (e.g., Apache Spark). However, for most smart agriculture scenarios dealing
    with individual farms with hundreds of sensors, time series storage is a lightweight
    solution that provides adequate performance. The water need estimation component
    obtains soil moisture, weather conditions, and weather forecast data from the
    time series storage (6) to generate ideal crop water need estimates. Water need
    estimation is further divided into physical and ML models, further explained in
    the next section. The estimates are in turn used by irrigation planning to generate
    an optimized and real plan that is aware of different physical and financial constraints
    (7). Farmers are shown the irrigation plan via the Farmer App (8) and approve
    or change the irrigation plan that is sent back to irrigation operation (9), which
    controls the irrigation system. From there, irrigation commands follow the way
    back to the mist going through the context broker (10), IoT protocol translator
    (11), and Inter-net/4G (12). Finally, irrigation commands reach sprinklers, pumps,
    and valves (13). Should the fog be present in a different scenario, the end-to-end
    communication would be preserved with small changes, as some components would
    be deployed on-premises in the farm office where the fog node is located, such
    as the LoRaWAN server. This scenario includes the direct operation of the irrigation
    system. In alternative scenarios, the irrigation plan either interacts with existing
    third-party irrigation systems (e.g., Netafim – www.netafim.com – or Focking –
    www.fockink.ind.br) already installed on the farm or even used by farmers to operate
    the irrigation systems manually. These options for interacting with an irrigation
    system are common, and we assume they are generic enough to represent an IoT ecosystem
    for smart irrigation. Flexible Data-Driven Soil Water Management Over the last
    decades, data-driven soil water management has been accomplished using physical
    models3 or triggering soil moisture sensors data4 [7]. However, as IoT enables
    more abundant data, with major spatial and temporal granularity and low latency,
    it increasingly allows the rise of data-driven approaches. Here, a key challenge
    is how to make all analytical techniques (e.g., physical models and ML) available
    to work together in a flexible IoT platform, considering that each crop, type
    of soil, and region may demand a different solution. In this sense, our work aims
    to show the roles that these analytical techniques can play in soil water management,
    and how they can be flexibly assembled together. Our approach is based on two
    main characteristics: Solution flexibility: Modularized components are integrated
    as services in the IoT platform, allowing solution flexibility. Increased ML relevance:
    Analytical solutions can be assembled from traditional physical approaches, and
    modern ML and simulation ones, and even by combining them. Benefits of this approach
    are not only improved irrigation plans, but also self-improved platforms that
    learn from experience. Soil water management is performed in two phases, namely
    water need estimation and irrigation planning. Water Need Estimation The precision
    irrigation problem can be modeled as the soil water balance system at the root
    zone, where the soil water content is the result of the balance between water
    content level and a series of mechanisms that make this level increase or decrease
    (soil water dynamics) [8]. IoT provides the ability to monitor water content levels
    and dynamics, while soil water management systems seek to maintain water content
    in an optimal range [7]. Figure 2 depicts the water need estimation process, divided
    into two key activities: Soil water content and dynamics estimation: This consists
    of estimating soil water content and dynamics through: Direct measurement of soil
    water content, rainfall, irrigation, and so on Physical models of soil water dynamics
    applied over the collected data (weather data mainly) and soil and crop characteristics
    Soil water need forecast: This consists of calculating soil water content forecasts
    and water need forecasts for each moment of a planning horizon, using techniques
    such as simulation and ML algorithms: Simulation is appropriated when working
    with physical models, iteratively applied to simulate future data points [9].
    ML takes advantage of data from multiple time series (soil moisture, soil water
    balance, soil characteristics, and weather data) of direct sensor readings or
    from variables derived out of physical models. Weather forecast data, provided
    by external services, can also be used. Different multivariate forecasting methods
    can be used to handle these multiple time series [10], [11]. Figure 2. Water need
    estimation process. Show All The process depicted in Fig. 2 allows flexibility
    once it allows different components combinations, as they are implemented as services
    in the platform. It is also possible to customize each combination, as they have
    numerous options inside them (i.e., different physical models and ML techniques).
    As an example, the SWAMP project provides two customized analytical solutions
    among all combination possibilities to fit the characteristics and needs of different
    pilots. One of them, called CRITERIA-1D [9], uses physical models and simulation,
    wherein soil water dynamics models (physical models) are the input to soil simulation
    that generates soil water content and water need forecasts. Another solution uses
    direct measurements, physical models, ML, and simulation, wherein the main input
    is direct measurement of soil moisture enriched by an evapotranspiration5 model
    (physical model) [7] as the main soil water balance contributor. ML techniques6,
    such as Panel VAR [10] and RNN-LSTM [11], are used for the processing of soil
    water content and water need forecasts, and simulation to test alternative irrigation
    scenarios. Note that the latter uses Panel VAR and RNN-LSTM, respectively, a traditional
    and a cutting-edge technique for time series, thus highlighting the solution flexibility
    in exploring different ML techniques as they gain relevance. Irrigation Planning
    and Operation The water need estimation models provide what can be called the
    ideal irrigation. There are, however, other aspects that need to be considered
    when conceiving an actual irrigation plan, that is, a plan that can be put in
    place in the farm, which include: Water availability: Water scarcity is a problem
    in various parts of the planet. Water quotas or supply schedules might not allow
    the ideal amount of water to be irrigated in time. If the needed amount of water
    is not available, the irrigation plan should allocate the existing water so that
    the best economic return to the farmer is achieved. Costs of irrigation: Even
    if the water comes from private reservoirs, irrigation is not free. Pumping the
    water to the fields consumes energy, and its cost has an impact on the farmer''s
    bottom line. For example, in certain regions of Brazil, the energy bill can account
    for up to 30 percent of the production cost. A cost-aware plan should avoid irrigation
    when tariffs are higher. Limitation of the irrigation systems: Irrigation methods
    differ in how much of the irrigated water actually reaches the plants: furrow
    irrigation has 60 percent efficiency, while sprinkler irrigation reaches 75 percent
    [12]. Other aspects of the irrigation infrastructure need to be considered when
    planning: maximum pumping capacity of the farm, uniformity of irrigation, and
    soil variability, among others. Figure 3 presents a modular approach that separates
    irrigation planning from operation, completing the data flow shown in Fig. 2.
    There are three main modules: Irrigation planning: Computes the timing and water
    volume of irrigation events that best address the crop needs, while being aware
    of operational constraints and economic interests. Linear and nonlinear programming
    techniques can be used, as well as approximate solutions such as those provided
    by metaheuristics [13]. Irrigation operation: Communicates with the sensors and
    actuators installed in the farms, sending commands and monitoring the operation
    to ensure adherence to the plan. It controls the opening and closing of valves,
    the pressure at pumps, and so on, using the underlying IoT communication infrastructure
    to send commands. The use of standard IoT interfaces and protocols enables on-demand
    addition of sensors and actuators, smoothing the transition toward fully automated
    irrigation. System Model: Computes an updated model of the system behavior as
    far as irrigation is concerned. IoT devices (e.g., soil sensors, water meters)
    in combination with data-driven techniques enable estimating the actual irrigation
    efficiency, and planning accordingly. Figure 3. General data flow between irrigation
    services. Show All Discussion and Lessons Learned Physical Models vs. Machine
    Learning The increasing use of IoT in precision irrigation brings spatial and
    temporal accuracy gain, as sensors can potentially be placed in all manageable
    locations on a farm. Thus, site-specific particularities can easily be considered,
    leveraging the exploration of data-driven approaches. In this context, the question
    of what would be the right combination of techniques to deliver adequate soil
    water management emerges. Do traditional approaches, such as using physical models
    or triggering soil moisture sensors data [7], still take place? Or is this the
    time to avoid physical models and use cutting-edge ML algorithms acting directly
    to data? Our vision is that there is no unique ideal analytical approach for all
    cases, as crops differ significantly in irrigation methods and in crop, soil,
    and regional weather characteristics. More than that, depending on crop culture
    or region, not all data features might be available or cost-effective. However,
    a discussion of the roles traditional and ML approaches can play in effective
    solutions can provide guidelines to discern the most appropriate alternatives
    to each application case. Physical models have been extensively used in irrigation,
    bringing implicit agronomic knowledge, as they connect raw data features to specific
    and relevant features. Nevertheless, there are important limitations, as general
    models involve simplifications that often ignore local particularities, while
    site-specific models work well only regionally, and few models have adequate performance
    levels for different regions. Finally, the few models of general application that
    are flexible enough to address different conditions [7] are often complex and
    require many data features that are difficult to obtain. On the other hand, pure
    ML approaches applied directly to IoT data seem promising, as cutting-edge deep
    learning is capable of capturing implicit knowledge from raw data in many application
    areas, as well as delivering highly customizable results [14]. For this reason,
    we believe that ML approaches will be extensively explored in scientific research
    in the coming years, allowing the emergence of truly cognitive smart irrigation
    systems. As such, our architecture approach, based on core components and deployment
    locations, gives the necessary flexibility not only to build customizable IoT-ML
    solutions, but also to assemble customizable data-driven solutions. For smart
    irrigation, we have shown that it is possible to use various combinations of analytical
    tools, including mixes of physical models, simulation (traditional approaches),
    and ML techniques. As ML gains momentum, existing physical models may lose room
    because ML could implicitly capture from raw data the same information physical
    models provide. Instead, IoT''s continuous growth might enhance the utilization
    of physical models, as they can calculate their outputs with better spatial and
    temporal granularity. Also, IoT tends to promote not only physical models but
    also ML. In summary, a futuristic vision may be that ML is well positioned for
    IoT-based applications. However, although ML seems to have a promising future
    for smart irrigation, we are still at the beginning of its exploration, and we
    need reliable data that now is still generated by physical models or a combination
    of data and ML techniques. All in all, considering the advantages and disadvantages
    of each side, we advocate that current solutions consider using both physical
    models and ML algorithms – physical models serving as feature engineering for
    ML approaches. We believe that physical models can aggregate agronomic knowledge
    that ML algorithms eventually cannot capture yet directly from raw data. Finally,
    as different physical models can potentially capture different aspects of reality,
    we recommend using multiple physical models, even for similar tasks. Then ML will
    hold the task of capturing valuable information from the features provided by
    the physical models to deliver more precise water need estimation. Integrating
    Different Stakeholders The approach taken is the result of a joint and largely
    interdisciplinary effort, and the authors'' ambition is to generate an impact
    on a wide community of stakeholders with the envisioned innovation. On one hand,
    the interoperability at the communication level provided by IoT is a key factor
    to promote a platform culture among not-computer-scientists, as it brings easy
    node deployment, data collection, and inter-researcher interaction. On the other
    hand, only with our flexible architecture approach due to the heterogeneities
    embedded in the agricultural scenario – heterogeneity of devices and simulation
    tools, but also farms and the stakeholders themselves – can the barriers be properly
    handled. Different stakeholders speak their own languages: for example, soil-moisture
    sensor data are numbers for computer scientists, bits for telecommunication professionals,
    voltage signals for electronic engineers, while the end users expect volumetric
    soil moisture values. As the calibration of these sensors is soil-type-dependent,
    geologists, agronomists, and other researchers must take part in the game of this
    context-dependent calibration process. Altogether, the smooth interplay between
    actors with different skills and habits is a key success factor. Each stakeholder
    needs specific and mostly mobile services, with the appropriate human-machine
    interface, if we want to deploy the appropriate level of automation with the man
    in the loop, as required in today''s agriculture. Services need to be organized
    like a chain of tools that mutually exchange information and understand each other
    thanks to a shared information model based on emerging ontologies. This shared
    data model fosters smooth and sustainable innovation because the tool chain may
    easily be extended to provide new capabilities and value propositions, and attract
    new stakeholders. Impacts For IoT Professionals Our approach incorporates the
    ML pipeline into the IoT continuum by using a structure of services deployed as
    containers that exchange messages through the FIWARE NGSI unified data model.
    This scheme impacts IoT platform development and deployment in many aspects: Automation:
    The platform provides a subscribe/notify mechanism for building automated data
    pipelines. Traceability: The storing of meta-data information about the model
    specifications and context of data used in the estimation allows keeping track
    of model forecasts, as well as quality indicators. Pluggability: The integration
    of new or updated models is facilitated by the unified data model, consuming data
    and producing water need estimates in a standard way. Flexibility: The pluggability
    allows IoT professionals to compose different data workflows flexibly by using
    various components. Hybrid environments: The architecture allows the use of different
    ML frameworks to train models, as well as hardcoded physical models. All these
    aspects have been allowing a relatively simple deployment of our platform in all
    SWAMP pilots, each one with its characteristics and different specific goals.
    In Italy, the goal is to use farm data for water management and distribution (i.e.,
    to share data outside the farm to create an even bigger system-of-systems). In
    Spain, the goal is to explore the limits of flexibility and precision in irrigation
    by going into a very fine-grained irrigation system where each sprinkler is an
    IoT node. In Bahia, Brazil, there is a large-scale use case with huge center-pivot
    irrigation systems, where the goal is to decrease operational costs through improved
    situational awareness. Near São Paulo, Brazil, the goal is to improve the quality
    of grapes and wine. For Farmers Currently, in modern farms that rely on physical
    water need estimation models and respect soil variability, farmers are provided
    with irrigation plans for long periods, such as weeks, months, or even the entire
    season. Based on their accumulated experience and daily work in the field, they
    continuously adapt the irrigation plan to avoid crops suffering from water stress.
    In this scenario, the irrigation plan plays the role of an offline longer-term
    forecast that needs to be fitted into the reality of the farm. In a fully automated
    future agriculture scenario, the IoT-based smart irrigation system will precisely
    control every aspect of the use of water, adapting it to shorter-term periods
    according to instantaneous information coming from the field, which can be daily
    or even based on intra-day micro adjustments in the irrigation plan. Between these
    two scenarios – current and future – lies a new IoT-enabled reality that will
    change the way farmers face irrigation. In any case, a requirement is that farmers
    always control the irrigation and are provided a wealth of real-time information
    to be able to make better decisions. To this end, we developed a smartphone app
    (Fig. 4) where farmers are informed of immediate water needs (Fig. 4a), measured
    and forecast water balance time series (Figure 4b), and the current soil moisture
    information for a 3-depth sensor probe (Fig. 4c). With this real-time status of
    the farm at hand, and equipped with the optimized irrigation plans computed by
    the system, the farmer can achieve better use of the water resources without harming
    productivity. Figure 4. Farmer application screenshots. Show All As the system
    reliability and precision increase and earn the trust of farmers, they can slowly
    give more power to the system to make automated decisions. In other words, the
    application will allow farmers to express policies on how to behave whenever a
    new irrigation plan is generated. Conclusion In this article, we present our flexible
    IoT-ML platform and highlight its scientific contribution over related work. The
    platform allows easy solution deployment involving IoT and ML components working
    in an application. Our real case is a smart irrigation application, where we exemplify
    how a solution can be built and customized depending on site-specific needs. Special
    attention was given to how the platform enables more exploration of ML-based solutions
    and on how it can positively impact IoT professionals'' and farmers'' needs. SWAMP
    project pilots have just been deployed; they are operating properly, and data
    is being collected. The next step, expected by the end of 2020, is to analyze
    the data and disseminate quantitative impact results. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This research

    impact. This review is addressing an analytical survey of the current and potential
    application of Internet of Things in arable farming, where spatial data, highly
    varying environments, task diversity and mobile devices pose unique challenges
    to be overcome compared to other agricultural systems. The review contributes

    solutions and implementations. Lastly, it presents some future directions for
    the Internet of Things in arable farming. Current issues such as smart phones,
    intelligent management of Wireless Sensor Networks, middleware platforms, integrated
    Farm Management Information Systems across the supply chain, or autonomous vehicles
    and robotics stand out because of their potential to lead arable farming to smart
    arable farming. During the implementation, different challenges are encountered,
    and here interoperability is a key major hurdle throughout all the layers in the
    architecture of an Internet of Things system, which can be addressed by shared
    standards and protocols. Challenges such as affordability, device power consumption,
    network latency, Big Data analysis, data privacy and security, among others, have
    been identified by the articles reviewed and are discussed in detail. Different
    solutions to all identified challenges are presented addressing technologies such

    The global population and its food consumption are growing alarmingly quickly,
    while climate change effects are simultaneously complicating the challenge of
    ensuring food security in a sustainable manner (Godfray et al., 2010, Tilman et
    al., 2011). Data-driven agriculture is one of the main strategies and concepts
    proposed to increase production efficiently while decreasing its environmental
    impact (Foley et al., 2011). Data-driven technologies in general are quickly advancing
    with the development of the Internet of Things (IoT), and may become an important
    part of the future of farming (Brewster et al., 2017, Jayaraman et al., 2016,
    Verdouw, 2016, Wolfert et al., 2017). Smart Farming, also called Agriculture 4.0
    or digital farming (CEMA, 2017), is developing beyond the modern concept of precision
    agriculture, which bases its management practices on spatial measurements largely
    thanks to Global Positioning System (GPS) signals. Smart farming bases its management
    tasks also on spatial data but is enhanced with context-awareness and is activated
    by real-time events, improving the performance of hitherto precision agriculture
    solutions (Sundmaeker et al., 2016, Wolfert et al., 2017). Additionally, Smart
    Farming usually incorporates intelligent services for applying and managing Information
    and Communication Technologies (ICT) in farming, and allows transverse integration
    throughout the whole agri-food chain in regards to food safety and traceability
    (Sundmaeker et al., 2016). IoT is therefore a key technology in smart farming
    since it ensures data flow between sensors and other devices, making it possible
    to add value to the obtained data by automatic processing, analysis and access,
    and this leads to more timely and cost-effective production and management effort
    on farms. Simultaneously, IoT enables the reduction of the inherent environmental
    impact by real-time reaction to alert events such as weed, pest or disease detection,
    weather or soil monitoring warnings, which allow for a reduction and adequate
    use of inputs such as agrochemicals or water. IoT eases documentation and supervision
    of different activities as well as the traceability of products, improving the
    environmental surveying and control in farms by the appropriate authorities. The
    IoT concept was introduced by Kevin Ashton in 1999 in relation to linking Radio-Frequency
    Identification (RFID) for supply chains to the internet (Ashton, 2009), but has
    no official definition. It implies, however, the connection of a network of “things”
    to or through the internet without direct human intervention. “Things” can be
    any object with sensors and/or actuators that is uniquely addressable, interconnected
    and accessible through the world-wide computer network, i.e. the Internet. The
    application of IoT in agriculture is advantageous because of the possibility to
    monitor and control many different parameters in an interoperable, scalable and
    open context with an increasing use of heterogeneous automated components (Kamilaris,
    Gao, Prenafeta-Boldu, & Ali, 2016), in addition to the inevitable requirement
    for traceability. As a result of IoT, agriculture is becoming data-driven, i.e.
    making informed real-time decisions for managing the farm, reducing uncertainties
    and inefficiencies, and as a consequence reducing its environmental impact. The
    application of IoT in agriculture, also called Ag-IoT (Zhai, 2017), AIoT (Zou
    & Quan, 2017), or IoF meaning Internet of Farming (Alahmadi, Alwajeeh, Mohanan,
    & Budiarto, 2017) or Internet of Food and Farm (Sundmaeker et al., 2016, Verdouw
    et al., 2017), has received exponentially increasing attention in the scientific
    community (Fig. 1). Even though the publications are mainly dominated by Asian
    scientists (Talavera et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016), in Europe several large scale
    international pilot projects, such as IoF2020 (Sundmaeker et al., 2016, Verdouw
    et al., 2017), AIOTI (Pérez-Freire & Brillouet, 2015), SmartAgriFood (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2012), SMART AKIS (Djelveh & Bisevac, 2016), or more recently SmartAgriHubs
    (Chatzikostas et al., 2019), are aiming to implement IoT technologies in the agricultural
    industry in Europe. Similar projects elsewhere include the Accelerating Precision
    Agriculture to Decision Agriculture (P2D) project in Australia (Zhang, Baker,
    Jakku, & Llewellyn, 2017), which complement additional major investments with
    the aim to help farmers convert to smart farming (Higgins et al., 2017, Pham and
    Stack, 2018). Download : Download high-res image (95KB) Download : Download full-size

    Several reviews have been done on IoT in agriculture in the relatively short time
    period in which publications about the subject have emerged (Ray, 2017, Stočes
    et al., 2016, Talavera et al., 2017, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016). In
    addition, review papers have been published with a focus on specific subjects
    related to IoT applied in agriculture, such as Big Data (Kamilaris et al., 2017,
    Wolfert et al., 2017), modelling (O''Grady & O''Hare, 2017), Wireless Sensor Networks
    (WSN) (Jawad, Nordin, Gharghan, Jawad, & Ismail, 2017), food supply chain (Ramundo,
    Taisch, & Terzi, 2016), Internet of Underground Things (Vuran, Salam, Wong, &
    Irmak, 2018), chemical wireless sensors (Kassal, Steinberg, & Murkovi, 2018),
    or Farm Management Information Systems (FMIS) (Fountas, Sørensen et al., 2015;
    Kaloxylos et al., 2012). However, to the authors'' knowledge, no existing review
    has focused on arable farming, which has specific characteristics and challenges
    that differ from those in a controlled environment, i.e. greenhouses, or permanent
    crops such as fruit orchards. Arable farming poses particular challenges due to:
    • much larger farm sizes, which affect the design of the sensor networks, the
    data processing, analysis and extrapolation of limited stationary sensor data,
    and the consequent decision making with regards to actuators, vehicle logistics,
    etc.; • the larger farm sizes also imply that spatial data has a central role
    in arable farming, affecting the data processing, decision making and precision
    machinery employed to address in-field variability not at plant level as in most
    permanent crops, but at subfield level with automatic recognition and actuation
    (Zude-Sasse, Fountas, Gemtos, & Abu-Khalaf, 2016); • greater use of mobile sensors
    and other devices on vehicles, which have specific challenges. While other cropping
    systems may also use sensors and devices on operating machinery, arable farming
    often requires a fleet of vehicles to operate in a co-ordinated fashion. This
    creates issues particularly regarding network infrastructure (Martínez, Pastor,
    Álvarez, & Iborra, 2016), e.g. connectivity to the cloud of moving things that
    rely mainly on mobile networks, or vehicle to implement communication, which implies
    real-time interoperability between machines and devices from different manufacturers
    (Peets, Mouazen, Blackburn, Kuang, & Wiebensohn, 2012); • larger amounts of heterogeneous
    spatial data generated at different rates and from very disparate sources: stationary
    sensors, moving vehicles and implements, satellites, data from web services, etc.,
    which need to be intelligently integrated; • highly varying and uncertain environmental
    conditions, as annual crops are more susceptible to weather changes and other
    external factors than permanent crops, which are more resilient mainly due to
    their deeper roots (Zude-Sasse et al., 2016), or crops in controlled environments.
    This obligates the IoT system to handle both spatial and temporal data, increasing
    the complexity of the data processing as well as the decisions based on the data
    collected. • more diverse types of field tasks per growing season in arable farming,
    from soil preparation and crop establishment, through highly varying plant nursing
    tasks, to coordinated harvest, which increase the complexity and also the risks.
    The IoT in agriculture is a fast-developing field, which can make reviews obsolete
    quickly. This challenge can be overcome by focussing a critical view on the general
    principles, main application areas and identify the limitations and challenges.
    Summarising, the aim of the paper is to provide an up to date novel analytical
    review of the role of IoT in arable farming, with the following specific objectives:
    • Provide an overview of the current situation of IoT technologies deployed in
    arable farming. Focussing on the current use of communication technologies and
    protocols, the generation and analysis of data, and IoT architectures. • Outline
    the different applications and capabilities of IoT in arable farming. • Investigate
    the main challenges encountered by IoT enabling technologies applied to arable
    farming. • Present key potential fields of application where IoT could be employed,
    as well as future directions of the current trends. The remaining part of this
    paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes the methodology used in this
    review paper. Section 3 provides an overview of the state of the art of IoT technologies
    used in arable farming; Section 4 presents an outline of the current and potential
    IoT-based applications in arable farming; Section 5 discusses the challenges and
    solutions found in its implementation; and lastly, the review closes with Section
    6 in which future directions are summarised. 2. Review methodology In order to
    address the specific objectives identified above, the literature listing from
    the SCOPUS database of the last 11 years has been reviewed. More precisely, the
    timeframe investigated was from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2018, selected as
    the whole period in which any literature about the subject turned up in the studied
    database. SCOPUS was selected as the primary literature source as it is a key
    peer-reviewed research literature database. The specific keywords used in the
    search criteria where: (Internet of Things OR IoT) AND (agriculture OR farming).
    To ease the searching process, the keywords needed to be present in at least the
    title, abstract, highlights or keywords. Additionally, the articles had to be
    published in English. Articles concerning greenhouse, livestock or permanent crops
    were excluded from the survey, as were supply chain related articles. However,
    issues concerning traceability at farm level were included. The survey was performed
    in a systematic manner following three steps (see Fig. 2): • Firstly, a list of
    1193 articles meeting the search criteria mentioned above was retrieved from the
    database. • In the second step, by reading the titles, any article that was clearly
    not related to arable farming was excluded, leaving a list of 293 articles. •
    In the last step, a second screening was made by reading the abstracts, where
    articles outside the focus of this review were omitted. After this step, 167 articles
    were studied in detail, from which 69 articles were considered relevant, 27 as
    partially relevant, while the rest were considered of little relevance. Relevance
    concerned mainly the connection of the article to the subject studied. The content
    of a relevant article directly addresses the application of an IoT technology
    in an arable farming scenario. A partially relevant article studies a certain
    IoT technology in agriculture in a broader sense. In the distinction made regarding
    little relevant articles included off-topic, lack of novelty, as well as non-peer-reviewed
    articles that lacked scientific rigour, e.g. ambiguous information or absence
    of materials or methods description. Download : Download high-res image (208KB)

    The final 167 articles studied included: 77 journal papers, 88 conference papers
    and 4 book chapters, of which 19 were review papers. The final list of articles
    was complemented with other publications that expanded on some of the IoT related
    subjects and technologies mentioned in the studied articles, and did not contain
    the specified keywords. These were found by a targeted search for specific subjects.
    Lastly, in each article from the final list a special focus was made on the IoT
    technologies employed, the applications, the challenges encountered and, finally,
    on potential future perspectives. 3. IoT implementation in arable farming IoT
    has recently been gaining momentum in the farming industry as it can fulfil the
    urgent necessity for interoperability across brands, scalability and traceability
    (Kamilaris et al., 2016). Different technologies are implemented as IoT is still
    evolving, adapting to a great diversity of uses. To cover the range of technologies,
    protocols, standards, etc. employed, this review is addressing the layers in the
    IoT architecture. Three layers normally describe the architecture of the IoT in
    the literature reviewed (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018, Khattab et al., 2016,
    Köksal and Tekinerdogan, 2018, Na and Isaac, 2016, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw,
    2016), though some authors divide it into more layers (Ferrández-Pastor et al.,
    2016, Ramundo et al., 2016, Ray, 2017, Talavera et al., 2017, Wang et al., 2014),
    depending on their definitions. More than three layers can especially be relevant
    in IoT systems with edge or fog computing, where an edge/fog computing layer can
    be considered in between the device and network layers (Ferrández-Pastor et al.,
    2016). Even though the naming of the layers also varies depending on the author,
    there is nonetheless a general trend to divide the layers into device, network
    and application layers (Fig. 3). Thus, this has been the adapted structure in
    this review. The device layer consists of the physical objects (things) that are
    capable of automatic identification, sensing or actuation, and connection to the
    internet. The network layer communicates the data to a gateway (or proxy server)
    to the internet (cloud) by the use of communication protocols. And the application
    layer typically stores and facilitates access for the end-user to the processed/analysed
    information. Download : Download high-res image (222KB) Download : Download full-size

    layer, in which the middleware platform is not always present. The collected data
    experience diverse stages during their transition from sensors to cloud, interfaces,
    and occasionally actuators, and these stages have considerable influence on the
    technologies applied in an IoT context. Six main stages regarding data flow have
    been identified in the literature reviewed: sensing/perception, communication/transport/transfer,
    storage, processing, analytics, and actuation and display (Fig. 4). The order
    of the stages is different depending on the IoT setup employed and the computing
    techniques used, e.g. fog and edge computing processes the data before communicating
    it to the cloud, an example of its application in precision farming is given by
    Ferrández-Pastor et al. (2016); while cloud computing processes the data in the
    cloud, examples of this are given by Hernandez-Rojas, Mazon-Olivo, Novillo-Vicuña,
    and Belduma-Vacacela (2018) and Na and Isaac (2016). Nonetheless, sensing/perception
    is normally the first stage, where data are captured by sensors, then the data
    can follow different paths and does not necessarily go through all the steps listed.
    In summary, IoT data is identified to be gathered or generated through three main
    processes: machine generated, which come from sensing devices; process-mediated,
    i.e. commercial data coming from business processes; and human-sourced, recorded
    by humans and digitalised later on (Balducci, Impedovo, Informatica, & Moro, 2018).
    These different sources have an influence on how to process, analyse and use the
    data in IoT solutions, and this needs to be taken into account in the overall
    data acquisition planning process. Download : Download high-res image (171KB)

    in arable farming. 3.1. Device layer As mentioned above, the device layer consists
    of the physical objects (things) that are capable of automatic identification,
    sensing or actuating, and providing connection to the internet. Sensor devices
    measure and collect one or more parameters automatically and transmit the data
    wirelessly to the cloud. And, when the devices become actuators, they generally,
    in turn, receive data from the cloud in order to activate or deactivate some mechanical
    component, e.g. a valve in an irrigation system. The device layer is also often
    called perception layer (Tzounis et al., 2017, Zou and Quan, 2017), sensing layer
    (Na and Isaac, 2016, Wang et al., 2014), or physical layer (Ramundo et al., 2016,
    Talavera et al., 2017). The devices are constituted of a transceiver, a microcontroller,
    an interfacing circuit and one or more sensors and/or actuators. The sensor measures
    a physical parameter, e.g. air temperature that is interpreted and transformed
    into an equivalent analogue signal, i.e. electric voltage or current, which is
    then converted by the interfacing circuit, i.e. Analogue-to-Digital Converter
    (ADC), into a corresponding digital format. Afterwards, the microcontroller, sometimes
    also in the form of microprocessors or single-board computers (Talavera et al.,
    2017), collects the data in digital format from one or more sensors through the
    ADC, and sends them to the transceiver, i.e. a wireless communication module,
    which communicates the data to a gateway. A comparison of microcontrollers and
    single-board computers used in IoT in agriculture has been made by Ray (2017).
    In the case of edge computing, the microcontroller or single-board computer processes
    the data from one or more sensors before communicating them, with the intention
    of, for example, reducing the amount of data to be transferred to the cloud and
    accelerating the data processing (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016, Sundmaeker et
    al., 2016). In fog computing the data are processed in the local area network
    level, i.e. in a fog node or IoT gateway (Ahmed, Abdalla et al., 2018, Ahmed,
    De et al., 2018, Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018). When employing an actuator, the
    signal is received by the transceiver, communicated to the microcontroller, where
    it is then converted to analogue signal by a Digital-to-Analogue Converter (DAC),
    i.e. the interfacing circuit, or to a digital signal by a Digital-to-Digital Converter,
    and finally interpreted by the actuator, which acts in accordance to the signal
    received. In arable farming, when agricultural machinery data are used, i.e. data
    from sensors and devices mounted on tractors or other agricultural machinery,
    the data in digital format is normally collected and accessible through the Controller
    Area Network (CAN) bus in the machine, although in some cases some data are accessible
    through other ports (Oksanen et al., 2016, Peets et al., 2012). Machine and operator
    performance information is accessible through the Machine and Implement Control
    System (MICS) of the machine, which can also be accessed through the CAN bus data.
    MICS data are used to allow machinery operators and farm managers to monitor and
    potentially improve the efficiency of their machines, by employing e.g. smart
    alerts or recommendation systems (Pfeiffer & Blank, 2015). Global Navigation Satellite
    System (GNSS) data, e.g. Real Time Kinematics GPS (RTK-GPS), are often also available
    through the CAN bus port, which allows, among others, vehicle monitoring and dynamic
    optimised route planning Edwards et al., 2017, Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018. Many
    different sensors and actuators are employed in arable farming. The type of device
    used depends on the purpose of the system in addition to the technologies implemented
    in the system. And the number of devices is steadily increasing. The number of
    IoT device installations in farms is expected to increase globally from 30 million
    installations in 2015 to 75 million in 2020. Furthermore, data points generated
    per day and farm are expected to increase from 190000 in 2014 to over half a million
    by 2020 (Meola, 2016). It was also estimated that by 2018 there would be 10 billion
    IoT devices employed in agriculture. However, the great amount of data generated
    is often unused or underutilised (Bennett, 2015), e.g. in countries like Denmark
    with a relative high ICT adoption in farms, in 2016 only 2–5% of farmers worked
    actively with the data generated (SEGES, 2016). Even if data usage is still relatively
    low, it is expected to increase rapidly (Bennett, 2015, Wolfert et al., 2017,
    World Bank, 2017) An overview about how they are implemented for different purposes
    is presented in the Applications section. 3.2. Network layer The network layer
    communicates the data initially to an intermediary platform and eventually to
    the internet (cloud), and from there to, for example, employed actuators. When
    the data are transferred to the intermediary platform, it typically uses wireless
    communication technologies, for instance RFID, WSN with Zigbee, LoRa (Long Range),
    etc., and more recently Near-Field Communication (NFC) (Kassal et al., 2018, Sundmaeker
    et al., 2016, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016). The intermediary platform
    is normally an internet gateway located in the vicinity of the connected devices,
    also including sometimes a proxy server, where the data are collected and occasionally
    processed in order to send the information further to the end user through the
    internet by the use of e.g. MQTT standards, or HTML or XMPP protocols. The use
    of Android smart devices or other operating systems is also increasing in popularity
    among agricultural applications, as they can be employed as a gateway for 3G and
    4G networks, and they frequently include other wireless communication technologies,
    e.g. Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, GPRS and NFC. They also automatically conform to communication
    standards and protocols, in which way interoperability is increased (Balmos et
    al., 2016, Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016, Gao and Yao, 2016, Hernandez-Rojas et
    al., 2018, Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018). In addition, Android and other smart
    devices can include GNSS and RGB camera sensors, and can relatively easily be
    programmed for computing data and displaying Graphical User Interface (GUI) applications
    being able to straightforwardly update the software if necessary. In that manner,
    Android and similar smart devices are represented in all three IoT layers, i.e.
    sensing in the device layer, node or gateway in the network layer, and computing
    data and displaying GUI in the application layer. Furthermore, the automatic software
    updating possibilities of smart devices allow remote installation of updates with
    new functionalities, bug fixes, etc. and easily improve the interoperability of
    the system (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016). Many different wireless technologies
    have been applied for diverse purposes in agriculture, depending on economic,
    accessibility and capability factors. Jawad et al., 2017, Ray, 2017 and Tzounis
    et al. (2017) have presented good overviews of the specifications of wireless
    communication technologies implemented in IoT in an agricultural context, which
    have been here collected in Table 1 and complemented with information from other
    relevant articles (Alahmadi et al., 2017, Elijah et al., 2018, Kassal et al.,
    2018, Sinha et al., 2017, Sundmaeker et al., 2016). The great variety of technologies,
    standards and frequency bands used exposes the relevant interoperability and application
    challenges found when applying IoT technologies. Potential communication standards
    for smart farming can be classified into short-range and long-range according
    to their communication distance, which determines their specific usability in
    different requirement settings. This is particularly the case in arable farming,
    where mobile network accessibility can be an issue in many rural areas, and where
    large farm sizes limit the use of some wireless technologies due to their reduced
    communication distance and due to the necessity to replace/recharge device batteries
    on nodes over large areas. These issues are addressed in the challenges section
    later. Table 1. Wireless communication technologies (adapted from Jawad et al.,

    m 1 mW a Not yet publicly available. A WSN is formed by pervasive devices called
    motes or sensor nodes, which integrate sensors and actuators that communicate
    wirelessly forming a spatial network (Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018, Jawad et al.,
    2017, Tzounis et al., 2017). In a WSN, base stations act as gateways forwarding
    the data to the cloud. Different communication technologies support different
    network node architectures, e.g. star, tree or mesh. Depending on the application,
    different wireless communication technologies are employed in a WSN as each has
    different node architecture possibilities, data rates, ranges, standards, among
    others, with the use of ZigBee, LoRa, Bluetooth/BLE, WiFi and SigFox being relatively
    common in agriculture. In arable farming, BLE has for example been employed for
    soil and air monitoring and irrigation control (Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018);
    ZigBee was used in a WSN for monitoring soil conditions and actuating an irrigation
    system (Mafuta et al., 2012) and crop monitoring (Zhai, 2017); and LoRa for air
    and water temperature of rice paddy fields (Tanaka, 2018) and smart irrigation
    control (Zhao, Lin et al., 2018, Zhao, Lucani et al., 2018). In order to cover
    larger distances, GPRS is appropriate and has been used for irrigation control
    (López-Riquelme et al., 2017), and for remote maintenance of machinery (Miettinen,
    Oksanen, Suomi, & Visala, 2006). GPRS, or other technologies, such as LTE, or
    3G/4G, are also commonly used at the gateway to transmit data to the cloud. Regarding
    other less common communication technologies used in WSNs, RFID can be integrated
    into a WSN too by connecting the RFID tag readers to a radio-frequency transceiver
    (Costa et al., 2013). Passive and active RFID technologies are used to a great
    extent in agricultural research and industry (Ruiz-Garcia & Lunadei, 2011), especially
    for animal production (e.g. Kamilaris et al., 2016), as well as vegetable or fruit
    product traceability (e.g. Kodali, Jain, & Karagwal, 2017); however, in arable
    farming only few examples have been found: e.g. RFID tags used for irrigation
    scheduling (Vellidis, Tucker, Perry, Kvien, & Bednarz, 2008), for agrochemical
    traceability (Peets, Gasparin, Blackburn, & Godwin, 2009), for vehicle monitoring
    (Sjolander, Thomasson, Sui, & Ge, 2011), and even on a prototype for soil temperature
    monitoring (Hamrita & Hoffacker, 2005). Regarding NFC, no concrete examples of
    NFC used in arable farming have been found in the literature reviewed. Finally,
    the latest generation of mobile communications, i.e. 5G, has higher data rates,
    large coverage areas, higher peak throughput, and also improved flexibility, which
    can open new possibilities and may solve some of the challenges encountered by
    many IoT solutions (Alahmadi et al., 2017, Marsch et al., 2016). 5G allows new
    options for monitoring rural areas with no previous infrastructure for Internet
    connection (Faraci, Raciti, Rizzo, & Schembra, 2018). 5G can also improve vehicle-to-vehicle
    or vehicle-to-anything communication in e.g. logistics solutions, due to its low
    latency and new frequency bands (Marsch et al., 2016). A challenge for the 5G
    networks will be the great increase in devices to support once IoT becomes a standard
    solution not only in agriculture, but also in any sphere of everyday life. 3.3.
    Application layer The application layer is crucial in an IoT context as it is
    this layer that actually adds value to the sensed and communicated data through
    directly controlling devices, supporting farmers'' decision making, etc. In this
    layer, several important services occur such as data storage, data analytics,
    data access through an appropriate Application Programming Interface (API), as
    well as possibly a user interfaced software application. The layer may also include
    middleware platforms that aid handling the heterogeneous cloud data improving
    interoperability. Data storage can be cloud based, i.e. on multiple servers, or
    more local based, where data are stored in different types of databases, depending
    on the application and design. Even if relational databases, such as Structured
    Query Language (SQL) databases (Gao and Yao, 2016, Goap et al., 2018, Ray, 2017,
    Wang et al., 2014), MySQL (Kaloxylos et al., 2014), or PostgreSQL (Mazon-Olivo,
    Hernández-Rojas, Maza-Salinas, & Pan, 2018) are employed in some of the reported
    applications in the reviewed articles, non-relational databases, such as Not only
    SQL (NoSQL), or also SPARQL, a semantic query language based database, are gaining
    attention due to their flexibility and scalability, especially when dealing with
    Big Data. Their ability to store and manage large amounts of heterogeneous data
    makes them suitable in many IoT agricultural contexts (Huang and Zhang, 2017,
    Kamilaris et al., 2017). Examples of NoSQL employed in agriculture are Cassandra
    (Huang & Zhang, 2017), Dynamo (Xian, 2017), HBase (Ray, 2017, Wang et al., 2014)
    and MongoDB (Martínez et al., 2016). An example of SPARQL has been given by Jayaraman
    et al. (2016). Data analytics can be achieved by cloud computing, where computer
    resources are managed remotely to analyse data, often Big Data, or by distributed
    computing, e.g. edge and fog computing. Cloud computing has the advantage that
    it provides high quality services that allow independent execution of multiple
    applications as if they were isolated, even if they are on the same platform,
    e.g. in data centres, which is especially relevant when dealing with Big Data
    (Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018, Martínez et al., 2016, Tzounis et al., 2017). However,
    cloud computing techniques mostly rely on general purpose cloud providers that
    do not comply with specific agricultural service requirements (López-Riquelme
    et al., 2017) and can experience latency issues, which are not acceptable in IoT
    solutions where monitoring, control and analysis require fast performance (Ferrández-Pastor
    et al., 2018). Examples of application of cloud computing related to arable farming
    are given by Khattab et al., 2016, Na and Isaac, 2016 and López-Riquelme et al.
    (2017). Khattab et al. (2016) present an IoT architecture with a cloud-based back-end
    where weather and soil data are processed and analysed for automatic activation
    of irrigation and spraying actions. Na and Isaac (2016) describe a human-centric
    IoT architecture with a list of cloud services, such as language translation,
    data simplification or updated market price information. And López-Riquelme et
    al. (2017) use FIWARE components for a cloud service for smart irrigation tasks,
    focussing on the benefits of using FIWARE as cloud provider. Regarding Big Data
    analysis and Big Data in general in an agricultural context, Kamilaris et al.
    (2017) and Wolfert et al. (2017) respectively have performed exhaustive reviews
    on the subject. The use of IoT middleware platforms is gaining interest due to
    its potential for solving different challenges found in the application of IoT,
    especially interoperability. IoT middleware platforms try to simplify the complex
    communication through the cloud due to heterogeneity of devices, communications
    and networks, by using enablers like standardised APIs and protocols (Jayaraman
    et al., 2016, Martínez et al., 2016, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017). Examples of
    these are HYDRA, UBIWARE, UBIROAD, UBIDOTS, SMEPP, SIXTH, Think Speak, SensorCloud,
    Amazon IoT and IBM IoT, with focus on context aware functionality; SOCRADES, GSN
    and SIRENA, with more focus on security and privacy; Aneka, WSO2, PubNub, SmartFarmNet
    and FIWARE, with a wider services-oriented approach; and projects like IoT-A,
    OpenIoT, or ArrowHead (Gill et al., 2017, Jayaraman et al., 2015, Jayaraman et
    al., 2016, Kamilaris et al., 2016, Martínez et al., 2016, Ray, 2017, Sundmaeker
    et al., 2016). Even if all these and more solutions are found in the IoT market,
    an intelligent middleware solution that addresses most issues observed in smart
    farming successfully is yet to be implemented (Jayaraman et al., 2016, Martínez
    et al., 2016, Sundmaeker et al., 2016). However, FIWARE (Ferreira et al., 2017,
    López-Riquelme et al., 2017, Martínez et al., 2016, Rodriguez et al., 2018) and
    SmartFarmNet (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018, Jayaraman et al., 2016) have been
    implemented effectively for precision and smart farming applications. In order
    to communicate data across platforms and IoT devices, ensuring interoperability,
    APIs are essential. These should adapt to evolving or new standards in order to
    ensure a longer life span, which may become a limitation if the APIs are not updated.
    It is through the APIs that data are made available for the IoT applications (e.g.
    Goap et al., 2018, Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018). These services may include tracing,
    monitoring, event management, forecasting or optimisation for agricultural activities
    and products. These applications related to arable farming are described in the
    next section. 4. Current and potential applications Multiple applications can
    be derived from the implementation of IoT in arable farming. These applications
    can always be conceptualised into the three IoT layers described previously, and
    are not to be confused with the application layer. Elaborations of the reviewed
    articles show that the applications have been differentiated and categorised as
    follows: monitoring, documentation, forecasting and controlling. Monitoring refers
    to timely sensing of very diverse parameters and is mostly the initial point of
    entry for other applications. Documentation covers the storing of sampled data
    for later use in e.g. farm management or traceability of produce. Forecasting
    employs different sources of data through precisely designed analytic methods
    for predicting concrete events. And controlling is the result of active monitoring,
    where processed data are used to automatically activate and control actuators
    in a predefined manner. A summarising table collects all the IoT applications
    in arable farming described in this chapter (Table 2). Most IoT-based systems
    include at least two of these applications and isolated applications are seldom
    seen. In addition, special attention has been paid to FMIS and associated decision
    support to improve operations and production processes involving vehicle positioning
    analytics, optimisation and logistics, which are key elements in arable farming
    (Bochtis et al., 2011, Bochtis et al., 2014) and have consequently got a section
    of their own. Table 2. IoT applications in arable farming. Applications Examples

    Automatic monitoring is the obvious first step in IoT applied to agriculture.
    Strategically placed sensors can automatically sense and transmit data to the
    cloud for further documentation, forecasting or controlling applications. Sensors
    are used to monitor crop parameters such as leaf area index (e.g. Bauer & Aschenbruck,
    2018), plant height and leaf colour, size and shape (e.g. Okayasu et al., 2017);
    soil parameters such as soil moisture (e.g. Brinkhoff et al., 2017, Kodali and
    Sahu, 2016) or soil chemistry (e.g. Kassal et al., 2018); irrigation water parameters
    such as pH and salinity (e.g. Popović et al., 2017); or weather parameters such
    as air temperature, air pressure, air relative humidity, rainfall, radiation,
    wind speed and wind direction (e.g. Yan et al., 2018). In addition, remote sensing
    can also be employed, i.e. instead of sensors placed in the field they are installed
    on satellites or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). However, these measurements mostly
    require some form of processing and interpretation as the values sampled are not
    directly related to the targeted parameters. An example of monitoring through
    remote sensing is the estimation of crop biomass and nitrogen content by the use
    of hyper- and multispectral images (Näsi et al., 2018), or the use of thermal
    remote sensing, which has been applied for e.g. irrigation scheduling or plant
    disease detection (Khanal, Fulton, & Shearer, 2017). Furthermore, agricultural
    machinery can also be remotely monitored, e.g. vehicle position and yield data
    (Oksanen et al., 2016), or machine performance (Miettinen et al., 2006). This
    is especially relevant with the increasing appearance of autonomous vehicles and
    robots in agriculture (Sundmaeker et al., 2016). Finally, at farm level the storage
    of crops can also be monitored to ensure the correct control of, for example,
    temperature and moisture, and avoid losses due to damage (Green et al., 2009,
    Juul et al., 2015). Environmental impact indicators should be integrated into
    farm monitoring applications, so that leaching (Burton, Dave, Fernandez, Jayachandran,
    & Bhansali, 2018), contaminants (Severino, D’Urso, Scarfato, & Toraldo, 2018)
    or emissions (Manap & Najib, 2014) are addressed too. 4.2. Documentation and traceability
    Collected operations and process data once stored can be used for documentation.
    Documentation is usually the natural application of monitored data but it must
    be noted that it can also include other types of sampled data, such as manually
    input or documentation of performed control actions (Sørensen, Pesonen, Bochtis,
    Vougioukas, & Suomi, 2011). The data are stored as raw data or as processed data
    at different levels. Documentation is essential for decision-making, controlling
    or analytics, and is an indispensable element in FMIS (Kaloxylos et al., 2014).
    Mapping is also a form of documentation where data are spatially projected onto
    a map. On-the-go sensors installed on vehicles and implements can be used for
    automated field mapping (Fountas, Sørensen et al., 2015), e.g. yield mapping used
    for later fertilisation planning (Lyle, Bryan, & Ostendorf, 2014), or soil mapping
    for site-specific amendment measures (Godwin and Miller, 2003, McBratney et al.,
    2003). Remote sensing can also be used for mapping crop development (Khanal et
    al., 2017, Näsi et al., 2018, Viljanen et al., 2018), or soil texture and residue
    coverage (Khanal et al., 2017). Remote sensing is becoming a popular tool for
    monitoring and mapping, but is yet to be proven feasible for all its potential
    applications. When documentation data sets extend beyond the farm level so that
    they can be traced throughout the supply chain, it is often referred as traceability
    and this notion is a key element in agri-food supply chain management as a measure
    to satisfy, for example, consumer demands (Bochtis and Sørensen, 2014, Pesonen
    et al., 2014). 4.3. Forecasting Forecasting is one of the fundamental functions
    for decision making that IoT brings to agriculture. Access to “real-time” data
    and historical data is used for forecasting events that require some form of action
    for managing successfully the crop or field operation. Therefore, both monitoring
    and documentation are important prerequisites for enabling forecasting. Forecasting
    is employed as preventive measures that require some action due to a predicted
    event, e.g. weeding, irrigating or harvesting. Machine learning and scientific
    modelling are examples of tools employed for forecasting. Different machine learning
    models have been employed, e.g. Artificial Neural Networks for forecasting maximum
    and minimum temperatures at field level (Aliev, 2018) or for estimating levels
    of phosphorus (P) in the soil (Estrada-López, Castillo-Atoche, Vázquez-castillo,
    & Sánchez-Sinencio, 2018); support vector regression method for forecasting soil
    moisture (Goap et al., 2018) or plant disease detection (Aasha Nandhini, Hemalatha,
    Radha, & Indumathi, 2017); gradient boosting for predicting irrigation recommendations
    (Goldstein, Fink, & Meitin, 2018); Bayesian networks and random forest for frost
    prediction (Diedrichs, Bromberg, Dujovne, Brun-laguna, & Watteyne, 2018); multiple
    linear regression and random forest in estimating yield and fertilisation requirements
    for forecasting harvest and fertilisation dates (Viljanen et al., 2018); or also
    for frost prediction using four different machine learning algorithms: decision
    tree, boosted tree, random forest, and regression (Moon, Kim, Zhang, & Woo, 2018).
    A rather different forecasting approach was employed by Jain, Sarangi, Bhatt,
    and Pappula (2018), where three different models, i.e. random forest, support
    vector machine and artificial neural network were used for forecasting diseases
    and at the same time for adaptive data collection from the network of nodes in
    order to reduce data traffic and energy consumption of the network. Summarising,
    IoT is allowing the sampling of large amounts of data, which can be employed as
    training data by the machine learning algorithms to build predictive mathematical
    models. Machine learning is opening new possibilities for effectively forecasting
    events in arable farming, which might change the very nature of decision making
    in agriculture. Scientific modelling has also been employed for forecasting in
    an IoT context, e.g. soil moisture dynamics and contaminant migration forecasting
    using soil sensor data and precipitation forecasts for irrigation scheduling (Severino
    et al., 2018); fungal disease forecast in winter wheat (El Jarroudi et al., 2017)
    and barley (Mäyrä, Ruusunen, Jalli, Jauhiainen, & Leiviskä, 2018); or forecasting
    field trafficability and workability for field operations (Edwards, White, Munkholm,
    Sørensen, & Lamandé, 2016). These modelling tools have an important role in agriculture
    as they are conscientiously developed and validated by the scientific community,
    and can forecast events for which machine learning models are very limited. There
    is also considerable potential for integrating existing and acknowledged modelling
    tools such as the soil-crop-atmosphere system model DAISY (Abrahamsen & Hansen,
    2000) or the soil erosion model RUSLE (Renard, Foster, Weesies, & Porter, 1991)
    into an IoT solution. Many of these solutions can make agriculture in general,
    and arable farming in particular, more resource efficient, e.g. through smart
    irrigation, as well as environmentally friendly, e.g. by smart pest and disease
    management. 4.4. Controlling In IoT, controlling is the result of active monitoring
    in an automated system, where the monitored variables are automatically adjusted
    to, for example, predefined thresholds. Forecasting can also play an important
    role in controlling. This is, for example, the case in smart irrigation systems,
    where irrigation is activated before drought damage in the crop is recognised,
    thus reducing yield losses. Goap et al. (2018) employed real-time sensing of soil
    moisture and soil temperature in combination with weather forecasts to control
    a fully autonomous irrigation scheme. Sensors on-the-go installed in tractors
    and implements can also be used to control e.g. variable rate fertilisation (Peets
    et al., 2012), site-specific weed control technologies (Christensen et al., 2009),
    or in-row cultivation controlled by plant patterns in precision seeding (Midtiby,
    Steen, & Green, 2018). Controlling is crucial in smart farming as it allows the
    automation of systems, especially considering the operations of autonomous vehicles
    and robots in the fields (Bechar & Vigneault, 2016), where site-specific actions
    and sensing-based safety systems will play an important role, e.g. for in-field
    obstacle detection for autonomous vehicles (Christiansen, Nielsen, Steen, Jørgensen,
    & Karstoft, 2016). 4.5. FMIS FMIS can be defined as systems that store and process
    farm-related collected data and provide decision supporting tools for farm management
    (Paraforos et al., 2016). FMIS assist farmers in the execution and documentation
    of farm activities, their evaluation and optimisation, as well as in strategic,
    tactical and operational planning of the farm operations (Kaloxylos et al., 2014).
    FMIS are consequently systems that can encapsulate all the applications previously
    described, and are vital elements in smart farm management. However, the adoption
    of FMIS targeted to the new IoT technologies is slow. A study published in 2015
    showed that most FMIS architectures used at that time had been designed in the
    1980s by researchers. This may explain why most FMIS currently have a structure
    and an architecture that is not suitable for distributed and service oriented
    decision support required for supporting precision agriculture and smart farming
    solutions, e.g. 75% of FMIS are still PC-based, and functionalities regarding
    traceability, quality assurance and agronomic best practice estimate are still
    missing or in their initial development stages in most commercial FMIS (Fountas,
    Sørensen et al., 2015). FMIS are key in smart farming and they should support
    automatic data acquisition, monitoring, documenting, planning and decision making
    (Köksal & Tekinerdogan, 2018). The latest research on IoT-based FMIS is expected
    to become part of the commercial FMIS available in the near future and will cover
    different needs across the supply chain and needs of IoT-based agriculture as
    a whole, as well as complying with standards ensuring interoperability between
    systems. In addition, decision support systems (DSS) are essential in dealing
    with Big Data and assisting the farm manager in management and decision making
    in tasks such as farm financial analysis, business processes or supply chain functions
    (Fountas, Carli et al., 2015, Kaloxylos et al., 2012). In order to design an up-to-date
    FMIS, it is beneficial to make preliminary use of dedicated system analysis methodologies,
    such as soft system methodologies (SSM), for identifying required changes and
    constraints and proposing solutions, followed by a later hard system modelling
    for designing the required specifications and components of the system (Sørensen
    et al., 2010, Fountas, Sørensen et al, 2015). It is also necessary to base FMIS
    on the cloud as it allows interconnection with diverse additional services (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2014). This development points out the inevitable need for standardisation
    of APIs in order to achieve interoperability among applications and services as
    part of the FMIS. New technologies such as distributed management systems can
    also enhance the capabilities of FMIS to a great extent (Fountas, Sørensen et
    al., 2015). Furthermore, the introduction of agricultural moving robots in the
    near future, as well as the wireless and automatic control and monitoring of agricultural
    machinery, also needs to be considered in the design and development of FMIS (Fountas,
    Sørensen et al, 2015, Paraforos et al., 2016). The future FMIS will also be capable
    of emulating farmers different work habits, as the system will automate certain
    tasks previously performed by farmers, which will require additional training
    (Sørensen et al., 2011). Consequently, it is important to provide supportive adoption
    and transition strategies for conventional farming to convert into smart farming
    (Köksal & Tekinerdogan, 2018). Examples of current FMIS employed in arable farming
    are offered by different technology providers: machine manufacturers, institutions
    or targeted private companies. Some manufacturers provide their own farm management
    tools, such as Agricultural Management Solutions (AMS) from John Deere, or Precision
    Land Management (PLM) from New Holland. Across brands some FMIS have a more local
    approach, e.g. the Dutch Akkerweb developed by Wageningen University and Research,
    while other commercial solutions have a global approach, e.g. 365FarmNet, Agworld
    or FarmWorks. 4.6. Vehicle navigation, optimisation and logistics Navigation systems
    are widely used in arable farming with the successful implementation of auto-steering
    systems in tractors and harvesters. However, IoT-based solutions are still in
    their early stages. IoT-based field operation monitoring (Oksanen et al., 2016)
    or monitoring of motor and machine performance (Pfeiffer & Blank, 2015) have been
    effectively implemented on harvesting operations. Commercial examples of agricultural
    telematics are Trimble''s Connected Farm, AGCO''s AgCommand, John Deer JDLink,
    New Holland''s PLM Connect or CLAAS’ telematics; however, they are all closed
    systems, which limits greatly the possibilities of the IoT technologies, especially
    interoperability (Oksanen, Piirainen, & Seilonen, 2015). Regarding optimised route
    planning, pre-planning harvest operations based on field data using simulation
    models can improve the harvest capacity of the vehicle or fleet saving working
    hours as well as fuel consumption (Bakhtiari et al., 2011, Bochtis and Sørensen,
    2009, Busato et al., 2007, Jensen et al., 2012, Zhou et al., 2014). However, field
    complexity and vehicle fleet size can become major hurdles for the algorithms
    employed (Seyyedhasani et al., 2019, Skou-Nielsen et al., 2017). The accessibility
    of field and harvest data can be eased by IoT technologies that allow automated
    data collection and sharing via common communication protocols and standards,
    in interoperable data formats, with compatible data model hierarchies; however,
    this is not always the case (Tzounis et al., 2017). IoT also allows cloud or fog
    computing to be employed to solve the high computational requirements of these
    route planning models (Seyyedhasani et al., 2019), even though the computing can
    also be achieved at the edge (Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018). Data communication
    costs, latency problems and unstable mobile connectivity may pose important challenges
    for route planning applications that rely only on cloud computing, making mobile
    edge computing more adequate and robust for these systems. Nevertheless, true
    IoT-based dynamic route planning is still in its infancy but gaining increasing
    attention, especially with the arrival of agricultural robots (Bechar and Vigneault,
    2016, Kayacan et al., 2015). Concerning its application, until recently, harvest
    logistics has employed field sampled data, i.e. boundaries, obstacles, gates,
    etc., to optimise the route of the vehicles involved in the operation statically
    (e.g. Bakhtiari et al., 2011, Jensen et al., 2012), where the complete routes
    of all vehicles are planned a priori. Nevertheless, these plans often do not comply
    with real-world challenges as they do not adapt to variating inputs, e.g. vehicle
    speed changes or in-field yield variations, or to unforeseen situations, e.g.
    machine breakdowns, eventual out of field delays, non-trafficable wet spots, undefined
    obstacles, etc. There is consequently the need to integrate route optimisation
    and operation logistics in IoT systems, where the optimisation can adapt dynamically
    to varying input and unforeseen events. It is only in the last few years that
    harvest logistics really started adapting dynamically to parameters such as vehicles''
    behaviour or in-field yield variations (Edwards et al., 2017, Seyyedhasani and
    Dvorak, 2018, Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018). Today, new possibilities for optimising
    infield operations arrive with the large amount of data available via internet,
    e.g. remote sensing data or other collected spatial data. These could be adaptive
    planning based on trafficability maps for reducing soil compaction or avoiding
    vehicles getting stuck in wet spots; or selective harvesting based on predicted
    grain quality maps, which is expected to increase the value of the crop harvested.
    5. Challenges and solutions When implementing IoT in arable farming, as well as
    in other contexts, diverse challenges limit or affect the performance of the systems
    employed. The challenges identified in the literature reviewed (Fig. 5) can indicate
    which areas need to be taken into account when designing an IoT-based system or
    point out areas that require further research. However, the results presented
    in the figure are indicative and do not necessarily describe the importance of
    the challenges included, especially because of the multiple applications and implementation
    designs that are conceivable in arable farming. Any of the challenges can become
    crucial in different setups, and are therefore described. In addition, all challenges
    can be related to or have consequences for other challenges. Download : Download

    of challenges mentioned by the literature reviewed, divided by time periods and
    grouped in IoT layers. Interoperability, in general, is a major hurdle in the
    application of IoT. There are different dimensions related to it: technical, syntactical,
    semantic and organisational (Serrano et al., 2015, Veer and Wiles, 2008). Technical
    interoperability refers mostly to the communication protocols which affect the
    hardware and software components implemented. Syntactical interoperability is
    usually related to data formats, their syntax and encoding. Semantic interoperability
    concerns the interpretation of data contents, i.e. the meaning of the information
    exchanged. And organisational interoperability involves intercommunication of
    meaningful information across organisations regardless of information systems
    and infrastructures in a world-wide scale. As interoperability is such a generic
    term, in this section, technical interoperability has been addressed as part of
    the communication protocol challenge, syntactical and semantic interoperability
    have been included under the data heterogeneity challenge, and organisational
    interoperability have been described under the scalability challenge. 5.1. General
    challenges 5.1.1. Revenue and affordability Often the investment for establishing
    an IoT-based solution is high and as such challenging for small-scale farmers,
    while larger farms can more easily acquire IoT-based technologies when investing
    in new equipment (Brewster et al., 2017). The uncertainty regarding required costs,
    e.g. fuel or water allocations, and selling prices of the product give little
    margin for many farmers for investing in new technologies (Higgins et al., 2017).
    Trust plays an important role when investing in IoT systems, and relieving the
    perceived risks by demonstrating the revenues from their adoption is essential
    (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016, Jayashankar et al., 2018). For example, in Europe
    70% of all fertilising and spraying machinery is equipped with at least one precision
    agriculture technology, but only 25% of farmers actually use precision agriculture
    components on their farms (Say, Keskin, Sehri, & Sekerli, 2017). Technology providers
    need to increase the perceived value by demonstrating the financial return from
    IoT in order to diminish the perceived risk of adoption many farmers have. Technology
    providers need also to provide robust tools that are aligned with farmer needs
    and practices in order to gain acceptance and trust of IoT technologies. These
    technologies need to reduce the workload, assist in decision making and improve
    the efficiency of the targeted practice. Additionally, technology providers need
    to develop interoperable and flexible solutions that can easily be integrated
    and comply with accepted standards. Governments can also incentivise IoT adoption
    by policies and regulations, especially regarding documentation and traceability
    as ICT eases paperwork and bureaucracy. A reduction in the percentage of mentions
    regarding this challenge (see Fig. 5) could indicate that IoT is being more adopted
    in arable farming. In addition, IoT is likely to reshape the arable farming business.
    The implementation of monitoring and control of farming operations are generating
    substantial amounts of valuable data that are essential for the business of technology
    providers. The way farmers will dive into the data economy, i.e. connecting their
    data to work in vertical and horizontal networks beyond the farm, will have an
    effect on their business models, as well as on the business models of technology
    providers. The point of view of the farmer''s business regarding IoT has not been
    fully addressed in the literature reviewed and will require further investigation.
    5.1.2. Data heterogeneity The diverse data sources and sensor manufacturers imply
    use of different unit systems, data structures and nomenclatures in different
    data formats, which result in reduced syntactical and semantic interoperability
    among IoT environments. Sensor data can be encoded in binary, or represented in
    formats such as json, xml, text (e.g. csv), shapefile, or even proprietary formats.
    The heterogeneity of data types and formats can also affect the performance of
    a protocol employed for communicating the information. Furthermore, this challenge
    becomes critical in situations such as system integration or sharing data with
    other systems (e.g. FMIS), which could imply developing data conversion tools
    or even redesign of the IoT setup. The use of standardised formats can help with
    this challenge. Some attempts have been made at producing standards or standardised
    formats that cover the great heterogeneity of agricultural data, e.g. ISO 11783
    (ISOBUS) developed by the Agricultural Industry Electronics Foundation (AEF) for
    tractors and agricultural machinery, which is very relevant in arable farming
    (Fountas, Sørensen et al, 2015, Miettinen et al., 2006, Oksanen et al., 2015,
    Peets et al., 2012) or AgroXML developed by the Association for Technologies and
    Structures in Agriculture (KTBL) mainly for FMIS (Kaloxylos et al., 2014, Köksal
    and Tekinerdogan, 2018, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Peets et al., 2012). These
    are now being integrated by the non-profit organisation AgGateway through the
    ADAPT framework and SPADE project for seamlessly communicating agricultural machinery
    data to FMIS, trying to enhance the existing standards and as a consequence improve
    interoperability (Brewster et al., 2017). A drawback of comprehensive data models,
    which try to describe all attributes of agricultural data, is that they become
    too cumbersome to handle in many applications. Finally, the use of middleware
    platforms applicable in smart farming, e.g. FIWARE or SmartFarmNet, can also reduce
    the problems caused by data heterogeneity (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018, Ferreira
    et al., 2017, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Serrano et al., 2015). 5.1.3. Scalability
    and flexibility Organisational interoperability is a key element concerning scalability
    and flexibility (Serrano et al., 2015, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016). Many
    of the systems described in the literature reviewed are centralised, closed, difficult
    to integrate in other existing platforms or difficult to implement on larger scales,
    different farming systems or geographical areas. They are also challenging to
    integrate beyond the farm level and across the supply chain in order to provide
    agri-food safety and traceability. The use of standardised dynamic protocols,
    such as SOAP protocol (cloud-based infrastructures with extensible ontologies
    that cover the broad and diverse agricultural production systems and environments),
    fast and reliable APIs (e.g. RESTful) and middleware platforms applicable for
    smart agriculture, such as FIWARE with its generic enablers, are tools that are
    employed to achieve organisational interoperability and make the system developed
    more scalable and flexible (Ferreira et al., 2017, López-Riquelme et al., 2017,
    O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Serrano et al., 2015). Service-Oriented Architectures
    (SOA) also bring possibilities to effectively integrate ecosystems through open
    and standardised interfaces, increasing organisational interoperability (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2014, Köksal and Tekinerdogan, 2018, Kruize et al., 2016, Pesonen et al.,
    2014, Sørensen and Bochtis, 2010). Scalability and flexibility may also refer
    to WSNs in the literature, to their capacity to support an increasing number of
    devices/nodes, with the network architecture, the gateway and protocols used being
    the main constrains (Elijah et al., 2018). This challenge has been considered
    under the network size challenge. 5.1.4. Robustness and fault tolerance Many different
    factors can affect the overall robustness and fault tolerance of a system. Robust
    wireless connectivity is an important limitation in many setups (Oksanen et al.,
    2016, Vuran et al., 2018). In the design of an IoT-based solution dealing with
    faults, errors and unforeseen events need to be taken into account in order to
    ensure the reliability of the system. Many of these issues are related to the
    other challenges presented here and can be handled at the device level, but also
    need to be thought of in the overall IoT system design (Ferreira et al., 2017,
    Ray, 2017). 5.1.5. Complexity The agricultural system is complex and can be challenging
    to work with. It is complex not only because of the multifaceted nature of the
    physical, chemical and/or biological processes in the soil-crop-air system, but
    also because of the technical complexity of hardware and software interacting
    with it. Depending on the novelty of the IoT technology implemented and the background
    of the developer and user, the systems can become more or less complex. For example,
    software and hardware incompatibilities can challenge its implementation and integration
    (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016), as well as many other challenges, e.g. the great
    field task diversity in arable farming, that can add complexity to the system.
    Technical knowledge can become a major hurdle for the implementation of IoT in
    farms, and it is therefore important that user-friendliness and plug-and-play
    basis have a high priority for the technology providers (Sundmaeker et al., 2016,
    Zou and Quan, 2017). Complexity should be an issue for the technology provider
    and not for the customer. In addition, the co-created development and implementation
    of IoT systems in agriculture by a multi-actor approach is needed to overcome
    the complexity at different levels of integrating IoT in agriculture. Good examples
    of this are the European Union supported research and development efforts through
    multi-actor large-scale pilot projects, such as IoF2020 (Sundmaeker et al., 2016,
    Verdouw et al., 2017), AIOTI (Pérez-Freire & Brillouet, 2015), SmartAgriFood (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2012), SMART AKIS (Djelveh & Bisevac, 2016), or more recently SmartAgriHubs
    (Chatzikostas et al., 2019). 5.1.6. Lack of products In the early stages of precision
    agriculture and IoT in agriculture, products that integrated agronomy and ICT
    engineering were lacking, which hindered their adoption (Ferrández-Pastor et al.,
    2016, Kitchen and Roger, 2007). The large scales and diversity of environments
    in arable farming can challenge the products used even more than in controlled
    environments, as they are to be modelled to describe larger areas, send information
    through larger distances and be exposed to harsher environments. Even if Figure
    5 shows lack of references in the last couple of years, it is still relevant for
    some applications, e.g. for in-situ real-time soil nutrient sensing is still a
    real challenge, especially regarding calibration (Bünemann et al., 2018, Marín-González
    et al., 2013). 5.2. Device layer challenges 5.2.1. Power consumption The use of
    wireless devices has major advantages over wired systems, as they are more economical
    to establish and can cover much wider areas. However, their power consumption,
    with limited battery life, is a major drawback of many wireless systems, and needs
    to be accounted for. This issue is so important that it is the main identified
    challenge in the literature reviewed (Fig. 5), especially for WSNs (Jawad et al.,
    2017, Tan and Panda, 2010). The large distances to cover in arable farming make
    wireless devices indispensable, and solutions to reduce their power consumption
    and/or extend their battery life are required. These solutions can include energy
    harvesting, low power consumption sensors and communication technologies or power
    efficient management. Energy harvesting techniques can include solar cells, micro
    wind turbines or other interesting solutions which have been well described by
    Tuna and Gungor (2016) and Jawad et al. (2017). The power consumption of the communication
    technologies and sensors employed are also to be considered in the design of the
    IoT solution as there are big differences between devices (Balmos et al., 2016,
    Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018, Jawad et al., 2017). Choosing low power sensors
    and communication devices needs to be taken into account when designing the IoT
    system (Estrada-López et al., 2018). Low power wireless technologies, such as
    BLE, have low power consumption but also low communication range, while Wi-Fi
    has somewhat higher communication range, but much higher power consumption (Table
    1), however data rates and other parameters are important factors to consider
    too. ZigBee and LoRa have been identified as appropriate candidates for many farming
    applications (Jawad et al., 2017). Power efficient management techniques of WSNs
    include sleep/active schemes, e.g. duty-cycling algorithms (Ahmed, Abdalla et
    al., 2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018, Alahmadi et al., 2017, Balmos et al., 2016,
    Dhall and Agrawal, 2018, Temprilho et al., 2018); data mitigation schemes, e.g.
    data aggregation (Abdel-basset, Shawky, & Eldrandaly, 2018) or data compression
    (Moon et al., 2018); energy-efficient routing schemes, e.g. mobile sinks by the
    use of UAVs (Bacco, Berton, Ferro et al., 2018, Bacco, Berton, Gotta et al., 2018,
    Uddin et al., 2018); and other combined solutions, e.g. LEACH, a cluster architecture
    with Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) based MAC protocol and data aggregation
    scheme (Kamarudin, Ahmad, & Ndzi, 2016), or dynamic power management by combining
    sleep/active states with dynamic data rates schemes (Estrada-López et al., 2018).
    Jawad et al. (2017) have provided a good overview and description of WSN power
    efficient management techniques. Lastly, techniques such as edge computing may
    have higher power requirements on the device, making cloud computing more desirable
    if power consumption is a constraint in the projected IoT solution. On the other
    hand, mounting sensors and devices on agricultural vehicles and implements allows
    connection to the power supply of the vehicle and as a consequence eliminate power
    consumption as a limiting factor. The type of sensors that are mounted on vehicles
    and their implements is quite limited, being currently mainly camera-based (e.g.
    Midtiby et al., 2018, Steen et al., 2012). Nevertheless, there is for example
    potential in employing sensors on the coulters of seed-drills for mapping soil
    properties (Nielsen et al., 2017), or other on-the-go sensors for mapping soil
    or crop variations (Peets et al., 2012). 5.2.2. Harsh device environment The natural
    environment in which sensors and other devices are placed can greatly challenge
    their functionality and longevity. Harsh weather conditions, e.g. large temperature
    variations, intense rainfall or prolonged high humidity can cause water condensation
    inside devices and consequently provoke corrosion and short circuits (Bauer &
    Aschenbruck, 2018). Sensors and other devices situated close to the ground experience
    exposure to dust, mud, or even corrosive chemicals, e.g. agro-chemicals, which
    can seriously damage the performance of the device or cause its total failure
    (Aliev, 2018, Bauer and Aschenbruck, 2018). Underground chemical sensors are also
    exposed to soil chemical and biological processes that deteriorate the sensors
    and can mislead the measurements, requiring unfeasible maintenance and re-calibrations
    (Burton et al., 2018, Kassal et al., 2018). Choosing adequate casing that does
    not interfere with the functionality of the device and also tolerates the environment
    they are located in is essential in the design of the IoT system. Sensors are
    also developed for different conditions, and need to match the system''s minimum
    requirements. RFID tags have been reported to perform flawlessly under extreme
    conditions and environments (Costa et al., 2013, Ruiz-Garcia and Lunadei, 2011);
    however, RFID technology is quite limited in its applications in arable farming,
    and suitable sensors and communication devices are therefore primarily dependent
    on the application and design of the IoT system. 5.3. Network layer challenges
    5.3.1. Latency, throughput and rate The large amounts of data generated in IoT
    applications do not only cause problems regarding data storage or handling, but
    also latency problems that reduce the throughput of the network employed. In arable
    farming, latency problems can be of great importance in some IoT solutions, e.g.
    in WSNs where high latency implies higher power consumption of a node (López-Riquelme
    et al., 2017), or in dynamic optimised route planning in vehicle logistics, which
    requires rapid responses to deviations in the route plan (Villa-Henriksen et al.,
    2018). For reducing latency problems, fog and edge computing can be employed,
    as these computing techniques decrease latency and network congestion (Elijah
    et al., 2018, Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018), e.g. data compression at the edge
    reduces the large volumes of data communicated through the network (Moon et al.,
    2018). In addition, the use of lightweight protocols can also reduce latency problems,
    e.g. LP4S for sensors (Hernández-rojas, Fernández-Caramés, Fraga-Lamas, & Escudero,
    2018), or MQTT messaging protocol, which has a faster throughput than HTTP and
    works well for bandwidth limited networks (Estrada-López et al., 2018). The communication
    rate is important to have in mind when planning the wireless communication technology
    to implement, e.g. 5G can handle high-rates, while SigFox or IEEE 802.15.4-based
    protocols are for low-rates (Bacco, Berton, Ferro et al., 2018, Bacco, Berton,
    Gotta et al., 2018, Jawad et al., 2017). The throughput of the network affects
    the communication rate, and the communication rate also influences the power consumption,
    which equally has to be carefully considered. Fast response to events is achieved
    by data processing techniques such as data merging (Tanaka, 2018), data compression
    (Zhao, Lin et al., 2018, Zhao, Lucani et al., 2018), or dynamic and complex event
    processing rules for conditioning input data and immediately acting accordingly
    (Mazon-Olivo et al., 2018). These processes can be on the cloud or at the edge,
    i.e. devices. Finally, test-bed analysis prior to implementation of the network
    can simulate communication rates and possible latency and throughput issues (Stewart,
    Stewart, & Kennedy, 2017). 5.3.2. Wireless link quality A low wireless link quality
    affects greatly the QoS of an IoT system as it ends in unreliable communication
    between nodes (Klaina, Alejos, Aghzout, & Falcone, 2018). This can be caused by
    multipath propagation (Ruiz-Garcia & Lunadei, 2011), background noise (Mazon-Olivo
    et al., 2018), routing problems, e.g. packet collision or limited band width (Jawad
    et al., 2017), or even by harsh environmental conditions, which affect the transceivers
    and the quality of the data transmitted (Elijah et al., 2018). Adequate design
    and testing of the network are crucial for avoiding or reducing this challenge.
    However, techniques such as channel access methods, e.g. TDMA, can improve the
    link quality by reducing packet collisions (Temprilho et al., 2018). Regarding
    testing, the calculation of signal strengths in real-time on the base station
    helps estimating the wireless link quality of a WSN when establishing the system
    (Klaina et al., 2018). Packet loss characterisation can also be used to assess
    the wireless link quality of a connection (Bacco, Berton, Ferro et al., 2018,
    Bacco, Berton, Gotta et al., 2018). Additionally, blind entity identification
    can also help estimating the wireless link quality of a network (Mukherjee, Misra,
    Raghuwanshi, & Mitra, 2018). 5.3.3. Communication range The different wireless
    communication technologies have very diverse ranges, which need to be accounted
    for when designing the IoT solution, together with other factors such as data
    rate, power consumption, communication protocols or costs (Table 1). In arable
    farming, due to the larger farm sizes and because of the employment of mobile
    sensors and devices on vehicles, this challenge becomes even more critical. Furthermore,
    relying on the approximate communication range of a wireless technology can be
    misleading, e.g. WiFi is often described to have 100 m range, but a test analysing
    the packet delivery ratio with respect to distance to gateway shows packet losses
    at ≥ 60 m (Giordano, Seitanidis, Ojo, Adami, & Vignoli, 2018), while in another
    test using WiField devices, 2.6 km range was claimed to be reached still having
    reliable internet connection (Brinkhoff et al., 2017). Testing the communication
    range is therefore important for some settings. In addition to the choice of wireless
    technology, network topology in WSNs, such as mesh topologies can also increase
    the communication range by using nodes to communicate with the central node (Ahmed,
    Abdalla et al., 2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018). Reduced range due to obstacles
    or topography is addressed in the propagation losses challenge later. 5.3.4. Communication
    protocols Differences in communication protocols can cause technical interoperability
    issues, which can lead to connectivity and compatibility issues among the hardware
    and software employed (Stočes et al., 2016). Network protocols are separated into
    diverse layers forming a protocol stack, where tasks are divided into smaller
    steps (Suhonen, Kohvakka, Kaseva, Hämäläinen, & Hännikäinen, 2012). In the infrastructure
    layer, some wireless standards that define communication protocols are commonly
    used by different wireless technologies, e.g. IEEE 802.15.4, which is used by
    ZigBee or 6LowPAN among others, or 3GPP, which is used by GPRS, LTE or 5G among
    others (see Table 1). In the application layer, standards such as HTTP (Ahmed,
    Abdalla et al., 2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018, Kaloxylos et al., 2014), MQTT (Ferrández-Pastor
    et al., 2016, Mazon-Olivo et al., 2018) or XMPP (Köksal & Tekinerdogan, 2018)
    are commonly used in IoT applications in arable farming. Adequate protocols are
    especially relevant and challenging in vehicle-to-vehicle communication, and crucial
    in arable farming. Different standards in different layers require careful planning
    of the whole IoT solution, as they are not always compatible and can also have
    an effect on the data formats used, or sensors and gateways employed (Hernandez-Rojas
    et al., 2018). Middleware platforms can ease the integration of diverse protocols
    and standards by offering enough abstraction levels so that this diversity is
    effectively managed (O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Tuna et al., 2017). Edge computing
    can also ease technical interoperability issues as a local computing layer is
    created to process data and create control rules before sending the data to the
    cloud (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016). 5.3.5. Network management Managing a WSN
    can imply battery change, software updates, calibration of sensors, replacement
    of devices and similar maintenance activities that can be very time-consuming.
    Smart mobile devices, e.g. smart phones, can make remote software updating possible,
    and can sometimes even be used for updating some other IoT devices (Ferrández-Pastor
    et al., 2016). Using energy efficient devices and communication techniques can
    also be employed to extend the battery life of devices (Jawad et al., 2017). Some
    sensors may require recalibrations with a certain periodicity, which has to be
    accounted for in the projected IoT solution (Kassal et al., 2018). Nonetheless,
    the management of the network is always to be considered when implementing IoT
    solutions in arable farming, where distances and number of devices/nodes can be
    vast. 5.3.6. Network size WSN configuration schemes have a maximum number of sensor
    nodes per gateway that the network can handle, i.e. the network size. According
    to the analysis of the reviewed literature, network size is being identified more
    often in the last two years (see Fig. 5), which seems to indicate new possibilities
    for exploiting the capabilities of WSNs. Network size depends on the wireless
    communication technology employed and can affect other parameters, such as data
    latency or scalability of the network (Balmos et al., 2016). Network topologies
    can also influence the network size and vary from simple star network (e.g. Hernandez-Rojas
    et al., 2018) to more advanced multi-hop mesh networks (Ahmed, Abdalla et al.,
    2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018, Langendoen et al., 2006) that can increase the network
    size by using network nodes as relays to reach a central node and gateway. Optimisation
    algorithms have been used to find the best spatial distribution of WSN nodes,
    and therefore to assist in the optimisation of its network size (Abdel-basset
    et al., 2018). 5.3.7. Propagation losses Even though propagation losses can become
    a big problem for WSNs in application areas like fruit orchards and tree plantations,
    in arable farming hedges, trees, big rocks or sheds, as well as pronounced topography,
    like hills and valleys, can also block, diffract or scatter the signal reducing
    the communication range and causing data packet losses. Additionally, weather
    conditions can also degrade the wireless connectivity propagation of signals (Jawad
    et al., 2017, Kamarudin et al., 2016, Stewart et al., 2017). To avoid or reduce
    these problems, adequate planning of the location of the sensor nodes, the antenna
    height, the communication protocols and the network topology is necessary. Regarding
    network topologies, mesh networks compared to star networks can reduce propagation
    losses as well as increase communication range (Kamarudin et al., 2016, Ruiz-Garcia
    and Lunadei, 2011). Moreover, propagation modelling can help planning, reduce
    communication tests and ensure Quality of Service (QoS) for heterogeneous wireless
    networks (Jawad et al., 2017, Stewart et al., 2017, Kamarudin et al., 2016, Klaina
    et al., 2018, Ruiz-Garcia and Lunadei, 2011). 5.4. Application layer challenges
    5.4.1. Data analysis Data analysis can in some cases become an important challenge,
    especially when dealing with Big Data, which is data in such amounts, heterogeneity
    and complexity that they need new data management techniques for analysis (Wolfert
    et al., 2017). Agricultural Big Data are worthless unless analysed; however, analysis
    can be very challenging because of the volume, diversity, and quality (e.g. errors
    and duplications). This is especially challenging in arable farming, where larger
    amounts of heterogeneous data are generated at diverse rates and from very different
    sources. The literature reviewed show an increased identification of this challenge
    in the last two years compared with the previous 6 years (see Fig. 5). This evolution
    might be caused by increased access and use of agricultural Big Data in recent
    times (Kamilaris et al., 2017, Pham and Stack, 2018). Techniques for lowering
    data dimensionality can ease the analysis by applying feature reduction models,
    which reduce data size by eliminating unnecessary data dimensions (Sabarina &
    Priya, 2015). Cloud computing provides the flexibility and scalability necessary
    for Big Data analysis, where numerous users operate simultaneously with the large
    and complex datasets (Gill et al., 2017). Likewise, cloud platforms are perfect
    for storing such large amounts of data, where NoSQL databases can store and manage
    these large unstructured datasets (Kamilaris et al., 2017). The analysis of Big
    Data can potentially be used, for example, for policy-making, reducing environmental
    negative impact, improve food-safety, as well as improved farm management and
    production, benefiting the different stakeholders involved (Kamilaris et al.,
    2017, Wolfert et al., 2017). Another facet to data analysis is the growing use
    of machine learning techniques, which are being used for exploring Big Data and
    identifying important factors and their interrelationship that affect agricultural
    production systems like, for example, identifying diverse patterns (e.g. crop
    development stages, weeds or diseases) as part of machine vision systems (Bacco,
    Berton, Ferro et al., 2018, Bacco, Berton, Gotta et al., 2018, Reshma and Pillai,
    2018). In these cases, the model is built upon a sample of data, often called
    training data, whose size and quality directly affects the final model. Choosing
    the adequate approach for building the model with the available data is also essential
    for the success of the IoT solution. 5.4.2. Data security and privacy Even though
    data security and privacy do not constitute a high challenge in the literature
    reviewed, they are certainly major concerns for the farmers, i.e. the suppliers
    of data and also end-users of the technology developed, who have little trust
    in service providers'' use of data (Jayashankar et al., 2018, Zhang et al., 2017).
    Also, data ownership needs to be taken into consideration as raw data and processed
    data in IoT systems have different ownership and are accessible by different actors,
    affecting the necessary requirements for data security and privacy (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2014). Research and development focus has been on sensing, processing,
    controlling and computing, while less effort has been devoted to solving security
    threats, risks and privacy (Tuna et al., 2017). Other issues like cost effectiveness
    in, for example, cloud services are also affecting the security of the data, which
    eventually affects the whole privacy and security of the IoT solution, as low-cost
    services have lower security (Dhinari, Newe, Lewis, & Nizamani, 2017). Technology
    providers should prioritise data security and privacy in their business models.
    The availability of privacy and security technologies that are dynamic enough
    to support the vast numbers and variety of stakeholders, as well as the complexity
    of the network, is still a major challenge that needs to be overcome (Verdouw,
    2016). Many solutions are being employed to reduce data security and privacy issues
    in each of the IoT layers of the system, e.g. encryption algorithms, intrusion
    detection mechanisms, authentication, secure routing protocols, anonymisation,
    etc. (Tuna et al., 2017, Tzounis et al., 2017). Middleware platforms are employed
    to add a security layer between network and applications, which can include confidentiality,
    anonymity and security to the system (Rodriguez et al., 2018, Serrano et al.,
    2015, Tuna et al., 2017, Tzounis et al., 2017). Additionally, newer technologies
    such as blockchain are aiming to solve many of the challenges related to privacy
    and security as well as transparency of the IoT. In agriculture, it is mainly
    being applied in the food supply chain (Bermeo-Almeida et al., 2018). Blockchain
    make sense for IoT platforms where large amounts of confidential data are handled.
    5.4.3. Data quality and availability Some of the challenges previously described
    have a direct influence on data quality, e.g. propagation losses, wireless link
    quality, robustness and fault tolerance. Anomaly detection and similar methods
    have been employed to identify faulty data before analysis (Cadavid et al., 2018,
    Lyle et al., 2014). The poor quality of data or its limited availability can limit
    many applications that involve Big Data analytics, modelling and machine learning,
    which can affect or even compromise the success of some IoT solutions (Balducci
    et al., 2018, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Wolfert et al., 2017). In these setups,
    and specifically in arable farming, many datasets are integrated from different
    sources and sensors, and the quality or scarcity of some data can become a major
    hurdle to overcome. Ensuring quality and availability of the data before starting
    such a project is required. Even if it is not always possible to gather all the
    data necessary to develop models, perform correct analytics or train machine learning
    algorithms, scientific assumptions (Severino et al., 2018), data augmentation
    (Diedrichs et al., 2018) or simulated data (Wolanin et al., 2019) are used to
    help or solve the encountered challenge. 5.4.4. Context-awareness (metadata) Context-awareness
    is an important and distinctive feature of Smart Farming as compared to Precision
    Farming, because it automatically includes descriptive data from e.g. fields,
    sensors, machines, i.e. metadata. Metadata can include information about the date
    and time, node identification number, data of calibration, height and position
    information, or even descriptive data about an experiment objective, field, machinery,
    crop genotype or soil information at the sensor placement (Jayaraman et al., 2015).
    Metadata about sensor nodes in the system are crucial for providing contextual
    information so that correct data analysis can be performed (Jayaraman et al.,
    2016, Ray, 2017). Context-awareness helps computing techniques to decide what
    data is to be analysed, and consequently easing the computations, and the lack
    of this data complicate data analysis substantially. This is especially relevant
    in arable farming, where the system has to handle both spatial and temporal data
    and make decisions based on the data collected. The use of standards, formats
    and middleware that support metadata is therefore important to have in mind during
    the planning of an IoT solution (Peets et al., 2009, Ray, 2017). Context-awareness
    facilitates new business models and strategies for data analytics and DSS software
    providers. 6. Conclusions and future perspectives A literature review of current
    and foreseeable IoT technologies and systems in arable farming was carried out.
    This has included an overview of the state of the art of IoT technologies, an
    outline of the current and potential applications, and a thorough description
    of the challenges and solutions. From this survey, the role smart mobile phones
    play is highlighted, especially Android devices, which are employed in different
    ways for a wide diversity of applications, due to their availability, connectivity,
    interoperability, programmable ease and computational power. The introduction
    of 5G networks in the near future will enhance the capabilities of smart mobile
    devices due to their enhanced performance. The intelligent management of WSN as
    well as the capabilities of improved communication technologies can also solve
    some of the challenges IoT-based solutions are experiencing. The role of middleware
    platforms and generic enablers are expected to gain acceptance and importance,
    as they can solve system integration issues and interoperability challenges. In
    general, regarding challenges, interoperability is a main challenge throughout
    the whole IoT architecture, where development and/or acceptance of standards and
    protocols is required to ease the issues encountered by many IoT implementations.
    Furthermore, challenges such as revenue and affordability of IoT systems, the
    power consumption of wireless devices, latency and throughput problems during
    data transfer, as well as the complexity of data analysis, and data privacy and
    security have been identified in the reviewed literature as of high importance,
    and academic research should direct their resources toward solving or reducing
    these issues. Technology developers need to ensure that the solutions create a
    real benefit for farmers and are available and applicable for both large and small
    producers. How IoT generated farm data will affect the business models of farmers
    requires further investigation as it is not fully addressed in the literature
    reviewed. The combination of intelligent power efficient systems with power harvesting
    technologies should guarantee longer battery-life of wireless devices. Computing
    data at the edge, i.e. on the devices, as well as lightweight protocols can reduce
    network latency and capacity/throughput problems. The emergence of Big Data is
    posing significant challenges for data analysis, as the complexity and heterogeneity
    of the huge data sets require the application of new analysis techniques beyond
    those traditionally used. Techniques such as lowering data dimensionality, cloud
    platforms and cloud computing, including machine learning algorithms, can help
    in this area and new innovative solutions are expected to be developed. Finally,
    technology producers have to guarantee privacy and security of the data handled
    throughout all the layers by employing different secure methods without compromising
    the user-friendliness of the solutions employed. Middleware platforms can help
    improving the privacy and security of IoT solutions, and techniques such as blockchain
    can assist with privacy and security problems of IoT platforms when dealing with
    Big Data. In the near future, interoperable and service-oriented FMIS that are
    integrated in the supply chain with intelligent analytic tools will take over
    some of the management and decision-making tasks of farmers and advisors, which
    will require training for farmers to adapt to this type of FMIS. Key decision
    support functions include farm financial analysis, business processes, or supply
    chain functions, which will gain importance with Big Data analytics. In addition,
    DSS for vehicle logistics will grow in importance as a way to optimise field operations
    using route planning and sensor-based site-specific applications. Finally, the
    introduction of autonomous vehicles and robotics in arable farming in the near
    future is expected to completely change arable farming operations and production
    praxes requiring fully adopted IoT capabilities. Acknowledgements This work was

    sensor networks and an open-source Internet of Tings (IoT) cloud computing platform\
    \ (“Tingspeak.com”) for data collection,\nstoring, data analytics, and visualization.\
    \ Te methodology incorporates the integration of hardware and software components\
    \ to\nmake irrigation decisions based on web resources like the weather forecast\
    \ from “weather.com” and sensor values from soil\nsamples. Te data collected are\
    \ then analyzed at the edge server and updated every 15 minutes. Based on the\
    \ threshold value, the\nsystem starts pumping water or stops the irrigation process\
    \ depending on the irrigation schedule. A web application was de-\nveloped to\
    \ display the result so that we could monitor and control the system using an\
    \ android application edge or a web browser.\nBased on the data recorded and measured,\
    \ the data are in comma-separated values (CSV) format and contain 143731 entries\
    \ with\n10 columns. Te sample size used contains 5722 rows and 6 columns from\
    \ the result of our machine learning algorithms using\nMicrosoft Excel and Jupyter\
    \ Notebook to process and evaluate the performance of the drip SIS, considering\
    \ the soil moisture, soil\ntemperature, sunlight, rain, and pump. Te results confrm\
    \ the threshold metrics classifcation evaluation, and some of the metrics\ncomputed\
    \ from our confusion matrix are shown in the classifcation summary results, showing\
    \ the accuracy to be 89%, the\nmisclassifcation rate (error rate) is equal to\
    \ 10%, the sensitivity is equal to 79%, the specifcity is equal to 93%, and the\
    \ precision of\nthe model is 81%. Te evaluation, when compared to K-nearest neighbours\
    \ using K \x1F 6 and K \x1F 1, shows the prediction accuracy to\nbe 97% and 98%.\
    \ Te results indicate the system is highly efcient and reliable in performing\
    \ irrigation and managing water\nresources and can be adopted in rural areas to\
    \ boost agricultural productivity.\n1. Introduction\nAccording to the United States\
    \ Census Bureau, the current\nuniversal population is estimated to be around 7.6\
    \ billion\npeople, up from 7.2 billion people in 2015 [1, 2]. Te world’s\npopulation\
    \ is anticipated to reach about 10 billion persons\nby 2050 [3, 4]. To keep up\
    \ with the exponential population\ngrowth, the “United Nations Food and Agriculture\
    \ Orga-\nnization (FAO)” report predicted that global food pro-\nduction would\
    \ need to increase by virtually 70% in 2050\ncompared to that of 2006 [3, 4].\
    \ Africa’s population will\ngeometrically raise to about 2.5 billion by 2050,\
    \ from its\ncurrent 1.2 billion in 2015 [1, 2]. Undoubtedly, there is going\n\
    to be a shortage of food owing to the enormously increasing\npopulation. Terefore,\
    \ it is crucial to continuously develop\nand explore innovative agricultural techniques\
    \ [3–12].\nTe importance of a smart irrigation system (SIS) as well\nas the issue\
    \ dealing with water efciency in agriculture\nproductivity comes into focus here\
    \ because of the pressing\nneed to consistently increase agricultural productivity\
    \ levels\n[13–17]. Irrigation can be described as the process of sup-\nplying\
    \ water to land to enable plants to grow. Water bodies\nHindawi\nApplied and Environmental\
    \ Soil Science\nVolume 2022, Article ID 7678570, 13 pages\nhttps://doi.org/10.1155/2022/7678570\n\
    are channelled through canals, ditches, pipes, or natural\nstreams. According\
    \ to Bjorneberg [18], over the years, dif-\nferent irrigation techniques have\
    \ been in practice to satisfy\nthe irrigation requirements for positive crop growth\
    \ in\ncertain areas. Te three foremost techniques of irrigation are,\nnamely,\
    \ drip/micro, surface, and sprinkler [19, 20]. Water\nﬂows over the soil (land)\
    \ for surface irrigation. Sprinkler\nirrigation supplies water to crops by sprinkling\
    \ or spraying\nwater from moving or ﬁxed systems. Micro-irrigation\nsupplies water\
    \ with frequent, small applications, usually\nwetting a portion of the ﬁeld. Another\
    \ minor irrigation\ntechnique is the subirrigation method. Here, the water level\n\
    is raised to or held near the crop root zone employing ditches\nor subsurface\
    \ drains to supply the water.\nNigeria’s irrigation capacity ranges from 1.5 to\
    \ 3.2\nmillion hectares. According to recent estimates, there are\napproximately\
    \ 2.3 million hectares in total, with over 1\nmillion hectares in the north [21].\
    \ Only about 40% of the\n142–106 hectares irrigated by public schemes are actually\n\
    accurately irrigated [21]; 32% for irrigated areas managed or\ncontrolled by the\
    \ River Basin Development Authorities\n(RBDAs) and 55% for those managed or controlled\
    \ by states\n[21]. Tis low rate can be attributed to the need for reha-\nbilitation\
    \ in most schemes—which accounts for 80% of the\nequipped area; high operation,\
    \ upkeep, and maintenance\ncosts; fuel shortages; or technical weakening of infrastruc-\n\
    ture and pumps. On the other hand, some known irrigation\nmethods have the disadvantages\
    \ of high labour costs, the\ncost of setting up an irrigation project and system,\
    \ poor\nwater management and control, erosion, water runoﬀ and\npercolation losses,\
    \ spot top and ﬁxture costs, not appropriate\nfor odd-shaped comedians, potential\
    \ wander and evapora-\ntion losses, and waterlogging, which can lead to mosquito\n\
    breeding and other parasites [22].\nAccording to Penchalaiah et al. [23], farmers\
    \ estimated\nthe maturity of the land and reserves to create revenue in\nancient\
    \ times. A farmer’s life is becoming increasingly\nchallenging due to reduced\
    \ humidity levels, water levels, and\nspeciﬁc climatic circumstances. Te wireless\
    \ sensor network\n(WSN) is made up of sensor nodes that can detect, com-\nmunicate\
    \ with computers, and communicate wirelessly [24].\nTe ﬁeld uses WSN technology\
    \ to manage and monitor the\nenvironment and soil conditions. WSNs are employed\
    \ in\nagriculture for a variety of reasons, including high inter-\npretation,\
    \ increased harvest yield, minimal energy usage,\nand data distribution. Agriculture\
    \ relies heavily on eﬀective\nwater management [25]. Water scarcity and high pumping\n\
    costs make good water management even more important.\nTo improve the use of water\
    \ resources and increase pro-\nductivity, one automatic irrigation system (AIS)\
    \ is now\ndeployed [25]. Tis one component of the irrigation system\nenables development\
    \ in areas where water is scarce. In this\nmethod, eﬃcient watering system planning\
    \ yields the best\neﬃciency while using the least quantity of water [23, 25].\n\
    In areas where water is scarce, water management is\ncritical. Agriculture is\
    \ also aﬀected, as a substantial volume\nof water is dedicated to that purpose\
    \ [25, 26]. As a result of\nthe potential impacts of global warming, water adaptation\n\
    methods are being considered to assure the availability of\nwater for food production\
    \ and consumption. As a result, the\nneed for studies that aimed at reducing water\
    \ usage in the\nirrigation process has increased over time. Commercial\nsensors\
    \ for agricultural irrigation systems are quite expen-\nsive, making this type\
    \ of device unaﬀordable for smaller\nfarmers. Manufacturers as well as the users\
    \ are now inter-\nested in low-cost sensors that may be connected to nodes to\n\
    create cost-eﬀective irrigation control and agricultural\nmonitoring systems [25,\
    \ 26].\nHence, this study focused on designing and imple-\nmenting a SIS controller\
    \ for use with drip irrigation owing to\nits cost-eﬀectiveness and eﬃciency. Drip\
    \ irrigation entails\nlaying emitter-equipped tubing alongside plants on the\n\
    ground. Water drips softly into the root zone from the\ndrippers. Because moisture\
    \ levels are regulated at an ideal\nrange, plant production and quality improve.\
    \ Drip irrigation\nalso prevents disease by minimizing water contact with the\n\
    leaves, stems, and fruit of plants; allows the rows between\nplants to remain\
    \ dry, improving access and reducing weed\ngrowth; saves time, money, and water\
    \ due to the system’s\neﬃciency; reduces labour; increases eﬀectiveness on uneven\n\
    ground; and reduces water and nutrient leaching below the\nroot zone. Te design\
    \ focused on using a microcontroller\nESP8266 system on a chip acting as the coordinator\
    \ module\nand moisture and temperature sensors acting as the trans-\nmitter module.\
    \ Te system uses a cloud computing (CC)\nplatform and an open-source Internet\
    \ of Tings (IoT)\nMATLAB platform called “TingSpeak” for collecting,\nstoring,\
    \ and transmitting data. Te sensor values are re-\nceived and compiled by the\
    \ microcontroller, which then\nsends them to the “TingSpeak cloud” via the HTTP\
    \ pro-\ntocol. When the soil threshold moisture value is low in the\nmorning or\
    \ evening, the system automatically waters the\nplants, unless it is raining.\
    \ It is programmed to collect, store,\nand analyze environmental parameters such\
    \ as rain, tem-\nperature, and humidity in order to actuate autonomous\nresponses\
    \ (i.e., start and stop the pump). When the antic-\nipated, desired or required\
    \ soil moisture content is reached,\nthe system automatically stops the irrigation\
    \ process, saving\nwater and energy. We can monitor and control the system\nusing\
    \ a web application.\nTe rest of the section of the study is structured into the\n\
    following four main sections: Section 2 will focus on existing\nsystems, the concept\
    \ of IoT, wireless sensor network (WSN),\ndata analytics, and “TingSpeak,” their\
    \ overall functionality\nand history, and future prospects of such systems. Section\
    \ 3\nwill focus on the development methodologies used to\nconduct the research.\
    \ Data collection and system analysis\nprocesses are discussed. Section 4 will\
    \ place much emphasis\non the implementation of the research, which is analyzed\n\
    and discussed. Section 5 will emphasize the discussion of\nﬁndings and a summary\
    \ of the study.\n2. Literature Review\nTe need to automate irrigation and agricultural\
    \ activities\nand use the limited or inadequate battery power of a node\ncompetently\
    \ has led to several hardware and software ad-\nvances in the sensor network area\
    \ [27]. Tis study by\n2\nApplied and Environmental Soil Science\nKagalkar [28]\
    \ found that SIS was designed to fulﬁl the water\nsupplies or necessities of the\
    \ plants by monitoring the soil\nmoisture as well as other ecological parameters.\
    \ Te system\nwas tested with potatoes to see how well it worked. Te\npotato plant’s\
    \ water requirements were 500 mm to 700 mm\nper area a day. Te soil moisture was\
    \ set to 300–600, which\nwas predicated on IoT. Every 30 seconds, it logs the\
    \ sensor\ndata to the CC platform “TingSpeak.com.” Te analysis was\nshown in graph\
    \ form, and the farmer could remotely\nmonitor and control the water pump over\
    \ the Internet using a\nWi-Fi module to access the web interface on an Android\n\
    application. As mentioned by Santhiya et al. [29], in the\ndesign of SIS, the\
    \ Arduino UNO microcontroller and An-\ndroid are connected with a personal computer,\
    \ data mining,\nand CC to store the data that are read by temperature and\nhumidity\
    \ sensors. Te graph generated in the web application\nmakes easy analysis and\
    \ the drip is managed. Te proposed or\nplanned system turns “ON/OFF” the drip\
    \ utilizing Bluetooth.\nTe project developed by Kashif and Poonguzhali [30]\n\
    was an automatic irrigation system (AIS), which waters the\ncrops based on sensing\
    \ the dryness of the land or soil. It uses\nwireless transmission techniques,\
    \ that is, RF transmission\ntechnique, mobile phones to receive SMS and to update\n\
    users about the condition of the plant. Web technology is\nused to view sensor\
    \ values, which aid monitoring and\ncontrol to curtail the wastage of water utilized\
    \ in the irri-\ngation progression. Tis process also helped to improve the\nagricultural\
    \ production.\nTis study “IoT-based Smart Agriculture” developed by\nGondchawar\
    \ and Kawitkar [31] shows all observations and\nexperimentaltestsdemonstratethatthedevelopmentisabroad\n\
    solution to ﬁeld actions, irrigation issues, and storage issues, by\nemploying\
    \ remote-controlled robots, SIS, and a smart ware-\nhouse management system, respectively.\
    \ Tese processes will\nbe done by means of any remote smart device or computer\n\
    connected to the Internet, and the processes will be carried out\nby interfacing\
    \ sensors, Wi-Fi or ZigBee modules, cameras, and\nactuators with microcontrollers\
    \ and Raspberry Pi.\nTe research environment is more persuaded towards\nresearch\
    \ at the software level as it has several possibilities,\nopportunities, and great\
    \ potential to yield momentous re-\nsults. Data collected by sensors are removed\
    \ by several\napplications, which set up data ﬂow or communication of\ndata in\
    \ the network. As mentioned by Sarkar et al. [32] in\ntheir work, they developed\
    \ smart agriculture using IoT and\ndiﬀerent sensors for implementing or executing\
    \ the smart\nagricultural and monitoring systems by utilizing various\nsensors\
    \ within the agricultural ﬁeld, pH sensor, moisture\nsensor, humidity sensor,\
    \ and proximity sensor for analyzing\nand sending data to the Raspberry Pi remotely,\
    \ which is then\nsent to Krishi Helpline for plant or crop monitoring for\nmaximum\
    \ or optimal production of crops or plants.\n2.1. Overview and Use of IoT. Ashton\
    \ [33] coined the term\n“IoT,” and RFID-based item identiﬁcation systems were\
    \ also\ninvented in the same year. According to Kashif and\nPoonguzhali [30],\
    \ IoTresearch is still early. As a result, there\nis no universally accepted deﬁnition\
    \ for IoT. Cabine [34]\ndescribed “IOT as the ever-growing network of physical\n\
    objects that feature an IP address for Internet connectivity\nand the communication\
    \ that occurs between these objects\nand other internet-enabled devices and systems.”\
    \ It is also\nreferred to as machine-to-machine (M2M), sky net, or In-\nternet\
    \ of everything, things having identities and virtual\npersonalities operating\
    \ in smart spaces using intelligent\ninterfaces to connect and communicate within\
    \ social, en-\nvironmental, and user contexts. A variety of scholars pro-\nvided\
    \ the deﬁnitions below as adopted and modiﬁed from\nSilverio-Fern´andez et al.\
    \ [35] and Sethi and Sarangi [36]:\n(i) “Tings have virtual personalities that\
    \ operate in\nsmart spaces using intelligent interfaces to connect\nand communicate\
    \ within social, environmental, and\nuser contexts.”\n(ii) “Te semantic origin\
    \ of the expression is composed\nof two words and concepts: IoT, where the Internet\n\
    can be deﬁned as a global network of interconnected\ncomputer networks based on\
    \ a standard commu-\nnication protocol, the Internet suite (TCP/IP),” and\n“thing”\
    \ is an unidentiﬁed object. As a result, the\nterm “IoT” refers to a “global network\
    \ of inter-\nconnected, uniquely addressable objects based on\nstandard communication\
    \ protocols.”\n(iii) “IoT enables people and things to connect anytime,\nanywhere,\
    \ with anything and anyone, ideally over\nany path or network and using any service.”\n\
    Other deﬁnitions are as follows:\n(i) “A dynamic global network infrastructure\
    \ with self-\nconﬁguring capabilities based on standard and in-\nteroperable communication\
    \ protocols where phys-\nical and virtual ‘Tings’ have identities, physical\n\
    attributes, and virtual personalities and use intelli-\ngent interfaces, and are\
    \ seamlessly integrated into\nthe information network [37].”\n(ii) “Tings having\
    \ identities and virtual personalities\noperating in smart spaces using intelligent\
    \ interfaces\nto connect and communicate within social, envi-\nronmental, and\
    \ user contexts [38].”\nAccording to Cabine [34], “things in the IoTcan refer\
    \ to\na wide variety of devices such as heart monitoring implants,\nbiochip transponders\
    \ on farm animals, automobiles with\nbuilt-in sensors, or ﬁeld operation devices\
    \ that assist ﬁre-\nﬁghters in search and rescue. Current market examples\ninclude\
    \ smart thermostat systems and washer/dryers that\nutilize Wi-Fi for remote monitoring.”\
    \ Te US National\nIntelligence Council (NIC), in their description of IoT in\n\
    April 2008, considers IoT as one of the 6 Disruptive Civil\nTechnologies. Te IEEE\
    \ ranks IoT number 1 in the list of\n“Top Trends for 2013.” Te IoT promises to\
    \ be the most\ndisruptive technological revolution since the advent of the\nWorld\
    \ Wide Web. According to Cabine [34], “projections\nindicate that up to 100 billion\
    \ uniquely identiﬁable objects\nwill be connected to the Internet by 2020.”\n\
    Te implementation of a SIS made it possible to monitor,\nmanage, and control various\
    \ variables in agriculture, thanks\nApplied and Environmental Soil Science\n3\n\
    to technological advancements in sensor networks (SNs).\nRecent advances in sensor\
    \ and wireless radio frequency (RF)\nmachineries, as well as their merging with\
    \ the Internet, have\nopened up a slew of new possibilities for agricultural sensor\n\
    systems. Te IoT and SN are two of the most important\ntechnologies driving the\
    \ development of SIS. Te technology\nissues with SIS revolve around improving\
    \ the SN’s efciency\nand the system’s ability to function and perform efciently.\n\
    NS to explicate important environmental patterns and in-\ntegrate their data streams\
    \ not only to display or record\ninformation, but also to stimulate human and\
    \ self-sufcient\n(autonomous) responses, will result in increased agricultural\n\
    efciency. Te IoT architecture adopted and designed for\nthis study is shown in\
    \ Figure 1.\n3. Materials and Methods\n3.1. Specifcation of Adopted and Designed\
    \ IoT Components.\nSeveral microcontrollers that can be used, but the ESP8266\n\
    NodeMCU development board has been adopted in this\nstudy (Figure 2). Te ESP8266EX\
    \ includes a Tensilica L106\n32-bit RISC processor that consumes very little power\
    \ and\nruns at a maximum clock speed of 160 MHz. Tanks to the\nreal-time operating\
    \ system (RTOS) and Wi-Fi stack, 80% of\nthe processing power is available for\
    \ user application pro-\ngramming and development, which combines elements of\n\
    easy programming with the Arduino IDE (C++). It includes\nan 802.11 b/g/n HT40\
    \ Wi-Fi transceiver, allowing it to\nconnect to a Wi-Fi network and interact with\
    \ the Internet, as\nwell as create its own network for other devices to connect\n\
    to. Tere is also 128 Kb of RAM and 4 Mb of Flash memory\n(for program and data\
    \ storage), which is more than enough\nto handle the large strings that make up\
    \ web pages, JSON/\nXML data, and anything else we throw at IoT devices.\nA resistance\
    \ temperature device (RTD) DS18B20 wa-\nterproof temperature sensor was used in\
    \ this study (Fig-\nure 3). Tis sealed digital temperature probe lets one\nprecisely\
    \ measure temperature in wet environments with a\nsample 1-wire interface. Te\
    \ DS18B20 provides 9- to 12-bit\n(confgurable) temperature readings over a 1-wire\
    \ interface,\nso that only one wire (and ground) needs to be connected to\na central\

    \ Soil Science\nA corrosion-resistant soil moisture sensor was incorpo-\nrated\
    \ to measure the moisture content of the soil (Figure 4). It\ncontains two probes:\
    \ the positive (+) end is connected to the\npositivepowersupply,andthenegative(−)endisconnectedto\n\
    the negative pole of the power supply. Te blue potentiometer\nadjusts clockwise/counter-clockwise\

    been tested, and at the time, the indicator is on. AO is an\nanalogue (voltage)\
    \ output, which can be directly detected by\nthe AD port of the microcontroller.\n\
    A real-time clock (RTC) DS3231 RTC was adopted in\nthis study (Figure 5). It is\
    \ an I2C RTC with an integrated\ntemperature-compensated crystal oscillator (TCXO)\
    \ and\ncrystal that is low cost and extremely accurate. Te device\nhas a battery\
    \ input and maintains accurate timekeeping even\nwhen the device’s main power\
    \ is lost. Te RTC keeps track of\nseconds, minutes, hours, days, dates, months,\
    \ and years. For\nmonths with fewer than 31 days, the date at the end of the\n\
    month is automatically adjusted, including leap year cor-\nrections. Te clock\
    \ has a 24-hour or 12-hour format, as well\nas an active-low AM/PM indicator.\n\
    Te Sim800L GSM module was used in this study. It is easy\nto connect to Arduino\
    \ and other microcontroller units. It has a\n100% high quality, 3.75% work voltage,\
    \ Quad-Band 850/900/\n1800/1900MHz network support that would work on GSM\nnetworks\
    \ in all countries around the world, and a transistor-\ntransistor logic serial\
    \ interface that is compatible with 3.3V and\n5V. Pinout for the Sim800L GSM module\
    \ is shown in Figure 6.\nTe Nokia 5110 LCD display was incorporated in this\n\
    research. Te module was designed to work with the long-\nlasting Nokia 5110 mobile\
    \ phone, as the name suggests. Te\nPCD8544 is a low-power CMOS LCD controller/driver\
    \ that\nis designed to drive a graphic display with 48 rows and 84\ncolumns. It\
    \ includes on-chip generation of LCD supply and\nbias voltages, resulting in low-power\
    \ consumption, making\nit suitable for power-constrained applications. Te LCD\
    \ only\nuses 6 to 7 milliamps in its normal state. All the components\nwere interfaced\
    \ on a PCB board. Components are typically\nsoldered to the PCB in order to connect\
    \ them electrically and\nmechanically. Te number of pinouts on the LCD and a\n\
    description of each pinout are shown in Figure 7.\n3.2. Data Collection. Te SIS\
    \ was designed and implemented\nas an IoTdevice used for automated modelling and\
    \ sequential\ndata collection of real-time measurements of environmental\nparameters\
    \ such as soil moisture values, soil temperature\nvalues, sunlight, rainfall,\
    \ temperature, humidity, and pump\naction using an adaptive sampling technique\
    \ [25, 26]. Tis\ntechnique enabled the collection of samples from a small\nvegetable\
    \ garden in Abuja, Nigeria. Te workﬂow followed in\nthe development of SIS is\
    \ as follows:\n(1) Boot the system.\n(2) Get soil temperature and soil moisture\

    \ Te proposed SIS was\ndesigned and implemented with the capability to make smart\n\
    decisions when water is required by plants considering en-\nvironmental factors\
    \ such as rain, sunlight, temperature,\nhumidity, soil moisture, soil temperature,\
    \ and weather\nforecast. Tere is an apparent relationship between these\nenvironmental\
    \ factors, and all of the logical relationships\nbetween these environmental factors\
    \ will be determined by\nthe SIS design, and it is crucial for the implementation\
    \ of the\nSIS system. Te data values collected every 15 minutes to\npredict the\
    \ threshold status of water requirement are sent to\nthe IoT CC platform “TingSpeak,”\
    \ a platform for data\ncollection, storage, analytics, and visualization. Te data\n\
    model is designed to manage real-world data and logical\nlevels are used to classify\
    \ data, categorizing the various pa-\nrameters and evaluating and meeting the\
    \ water requirements\nfor a particular plant. Sensor data and weather forecast\
    \ data\nare used to make smart decisions for watering plants based\non the ontology,\
    \ and a machine learning model is used to\nevaluate the performance of the system\
    \ and can be deployed\nwith the ontology to make smarter decisions to actuate\n\

    \ Coding and Implementation. Diferent hardware\nand software tools were used in\
    \ the design and imple-\nmentation of the SIS, but the central focus here is using\
    \ the\nIoT to produce autonomous responses using data analytics.\nHowever, in\
    \ this project, we focus on the utilization of\n“TingSpeak,” a MATLAB platform\
    \ for data collection, data\nvisualization, data processing, and analysis (MATLAB\
    \ tool,\nadopted from https://www.mathworks.com). Te system\nwas programmed so\
    \ that it uses data retrieved from the\nsystem to perform irrigation.\n4. Results\

    processes and the model data, including channel information,\nmodel graphs or\
    \ plots, and conﬁguration used over the HTTP\nprotocol, which was aggregated into\
    \ a web page. TingSpeak\nsets up a WebSocket to collect and process the log messages\
    \ of\nevents. It also uses the Java Logging API, which sends the\nmessage to the\
    \ WebSocket. Te GSM module aids in sending\nSMS to a mobile, which is also used\
    \ to monitor system status.\nForeach ﬁeld, thechannel isupdated andthe visualizationcan\n\
    be viewed in Figures 12–14 for the soil temperature, soil\nmoisture, and rainfall,\
    \ respectively.\nFrom Figure 12, the soil temperature drops with time as\nthe\
    \ day light/sunshine goes down. From the ﬁgure, the\ntemperature dropped from\
    \ 23° to 21° after 4:00 pm.\nFrom Figure 13, the graph shows the variations in\
    \ the\nwater content in the soil as it ﬂows down with time. Te\nhighest value\
    \ of soil moisture was reached.\nFrom Figure 14, it is evident from the graph\
    \ that no\nrainfall was recorded between these times. As this research\ndepends\
    \ on using rain information to predict irrigation\nschedules, the system will\
    \ wait for rain to water the plant if\nthere is a possibility of rain.\nTe data\
    \ from sensors (i.e., moisture and temperature,\nhumidity reading), sprinkler/pump\
    \ state, and web (i.e., rain,\nsunshine, temp) are loaded from the SIS and displayed\
    \ on\nthe LCD. Te data (system status) are output on the LCD.\nTe LCD display\

    \ make\ncalls using the void ctrl_call() function to alert you that the\nsystem\
    \ is now active or activated for irrigation, monitoring,\nand control, as shown\
    \ in Figures 17 and 18.\n4.1. Techniques for Model Evaluation and Analysis. Data\n\
    analysis was developed for eﬀective system performance. A\nweb application is\
    \ employed to monitor and control the\nstatus of the system. A supervised machine\
    \ learning ap-\nproach was used according to Mohammad and Sulaiman\n[39]. Tere\
    \ are threshold metrics for classiﬁcation evalua-\ntions using the confusion matrix\
    \ as our model evaluation\nmatrix. Tere is a list of rates that are computed from\
    \ the\nconfusion matrix for a binary classiﬁer and multiclass\nclassiﬁcation as\
    \ shown in Table 1.\n4.2. Summary of Evaluation Results. Based on the data\nanalysis,\
    \ the following major ﬁnding was discovered: the ﬁrst\nfeature could be summarized\
    \ by the “confusion matrix” in\nTable 2.\nRepresented as “true positive (TP) \x88\
    \ 2386, true negative\n(TN) \x88 188, false positive (FP \x88 191), and false\
    \ negative\n(TN) \x88 188.” Te results from the confusion matrix are\nshown in\
    \ the classiﬁcation summary results, which shows\nthe accuracy to be 0.89, which\
    \ is high, the misclassiﬁcation\nrate (error rate) is equal to 0.1, the sensitivity\
    \ is high and is\nequal to 0.79, the speciﬁcity is equal to 0.93, and the pre-\n\
    cision of the model is 0.81.\nTe evaluation is compared with another machine\n\
    learning algorithm like K-NN using K \x88 6 and K \x88 1. Te\nprediction accuracy\
    \ was evaluated, and it shows that KNN is\n0.97 and 0.98. k \x88 6 and k \x88\
    \ 1 have a higher score for pre-\ndiction accuracy. Tis implies that the smart\
    \ system irri-\ngation system has a high accuracy capable of predicting the\n\
    water needs of plants up to 98%.\nTeadvantagesoftheSIScontrollerdesignusedinthisstudy\n\
    when compared to other previous designs are evident owing to\nits cost-eﬀectiveness\
    \ and eﬃciency. It is, however, suggested\nthat more advancement of this SIS controller\
    \ design should be\nprospectively given appropriate attention subsequently.\n\
    5. Conclusion\nAlthough the study’s goals and objectives were met to a\nsatisfactory\

  explanation: 'Soil moisture sensors and weather stations for real-time, localized
    data collection are important devices that can be integrated with other precision
    agriculture technologies, such as yield monitors, variable-rate application equipment,
    and automated irrigation systems. These devices collect data on soil moisture
    levels, temperature, and other environmental factors that can be used to make
    informed decisions about irrigation scheduling and other crop management practices.
    Soil moisture sensors can also be used to monitor water usage and identify areas
    of the field that are not getting enough water.


    Soil moisture sensors are typically installed underground, and they measure the
    soil moisture content using a variety of methods, such as capacitance, resistance,
    or tensiometry. Weather stations measure temperature, humidity, wind speed, and
    other environmental factors that can impact crop growth and development.


    The data collected from soil moisture sensors and weather stations can be used
    to create irrigation schedules that are tailored to the specific needs of the
    crop and the field conditions. This can help to reduce water usage and improve
    crop yields.


    In addition to soil moisture sensors and weather stations, other precision agriculture
    technologies that can be integrated with other precision agriculture technologies
    include:


    * **Yield monitors:** Collect data on crop yield during harvest, which can be
    used to create yield maps that identify areas of the field that are more or less
    productive.

    * **Variable-rate application equipment:** Can apply inputs, such as fertilizer
    or pesticides, at different rates across the field based on the data collected
    from soil moisture sensors, yield monitors, and other precision agriculture technologies.

    * **Automated irrigation systems:** Can be used to control irrigation based on
    the data collected from soil moisture sensors and weather stations.


    By integrating these different precision agriculture technologies, farmers can
    create a complete system that can help them to improve crop yields, reduce water
    usage, and optimize their overall farming operation.'

    rise in the population has immensely increased the pressure on the agriculture
    sector. With the advent of technology, this decade is witnessing a shift from
    conventional approaches to the most advanced ones. The Internet of Things (IoT)
    has transformed both the quality and quantity of the agriculture sector. Hybridization
    of species along with the real-time monitoring of the farms paved a way for resource
    optimization. Scientists, research institutions, academicians, and most nations
    across the globe are moving towards the practice and execution of collaborative
    projects to explore the horizon of this field for serving mankind. The tech industry
    is racing to provide more optimal solutions. Inclusion of IoT, along with cloud
    computing, big data analytics, and wireless sensor networks can provide sufficient
    scope to predict, process, and analyze the situations and improve the activities
    in the real-time scenario. The concept of heterogeneity and interoperability of
    the devices by providing flexible, scalable, and durable methods, models are also
    opening new domains in this field. Therefore, this paper contributes towards the
    recent IoT technologies in the agriculture sector, along with the development
    of hardware and software systems. The public and private sector projects and startup''s
    started all over the globe to provide smart and sustainable solutions in precision
    agriculture are also discussed. The current scenario, applications, research potential,
    limitations, and future aspects are briefly discussed. Based on the concepts of
    IoT a precision farming framework is also proposed in this article. A graphical

    term ‘Agriculture’ is inferred from the Latin words ‘Ager’ means ‘Land’ and ‘Culture’
    means ‘Cultivation’. It is the milestone field of human civilization and is one
    of the benchmark areas. This field is the withstander of the economies of various
    nations. According to the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations
    (FAO), more than 60% of the human population depends on agriculture for survival
    and around 12% of the total land area is under agricultural production [1]. Predicted
    by FAO, the global population will reach the mark of 8 billion people by the year
    2025 and 9.6 billion by the end of 2050 (FAO, 2009) [2]. The interpretation of
    this data shows that to tackle this population growth, an estimated increase of
    70% in food production must be achieved worldwide by 2050 [3]. Agriculture is
    also the second-largest greenhouse gas (GHG) emitter, because of fossil-based
    fertilizers, biomass, and machinery. In some of the developed and developing nations,
    the agriculture sector is the backbone of the economy. This field has a huge contribution
    in the growth of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of developing countries, in particular,
    some of them are listed in TABLE 1. TABLE 1 Nations Having Agriculture as a Major
    Part of Their GDP [4] In India, 53% of the population is dependent on the agriculture
    sector for employment and 61.5 % of the Indian population is primarily dependent
    on the agriculture sector for its livelihood [5]. Focusing on the market size,
    India is the second-largest fruit producer in the world. Based on certain data
    and statistics, the farming income in India is expected to double by 2022. Eyeing
    this change, there is an intra-state cluster development of certain states in
    terms of the agriculture sector. The various stats and numbers representing the
    impact of agriculture in the overall economic development of India as compared
    to other fields has been shown in Fig. 1. FIGURE 1. Contributions of various sectors
    in the Indian economy [6]. Show All At present, the demand is more than the supply
    generated and this curve will illustrate more unstable results in the coming years,
    due to increase in demand with population rise. To maintain the demand-supply
    curve, there will be enormous stress on the agricultural sector. Global warming
    and changing climatic conditions are also important factors to be taken into consideration.
    From the past decades, due to the increase in demand and pressure on the overall
    structure of the field, this area is witnessing the slow but progressive shift
    from traditional approaches to the most advanced technology-driven methods. The
    use of traditional approaches and conventional methods, as well as the changes
    in the environment, lay stress on the agricultural sector. Some of the challenges
    for the agricultural sector are given as follows: The use of traditional techniques
    of farming hinders the optimization of both cost and time. Depletion of the topsoil
    due to floods and winds resulting in the deposition of the pollutants, sediments,
    nitrates, and phosphates, result in causing the eutrophication and the runoff
    of the soil. Planting the same crop after each harvest makes the soil redundant
    of the essential nutrients. Water scarcity due to the climatic changes lowers
    the level of groundwater for irrigation, thereby disturbing the water cycle. Global
    climate changes due to the destruction of the tropical forests and the other vegetative
    species in agriculture result in the elevation of the carbon dioxide and other
    greenhouse gas levels. Lack of expertise in proper recognition of the particular
    plant species. There is no proper method to detect the disease at early stages,
    such that precautionary measures could be taken to prevent it. Therefore, because
    of these factors, the need for the creation of modern methods and intensification
    of the agricultural practices to use water, soil, minerals, and other resources
    efficiently becomes obligatory. The nature of the technology and devices is changing
    i.e. it never settles for any less. A lot of research papers addressing the challenges
    of agriculture in the IoT domain have been put forth. Constant developments and
    everlasting expectations from the existing technologies paves a great way for
    motivating academicians and researchers to set and attain new standards. During
    recent years, there has been a paradigm shift in the study and application of
    domains like IoT, cloud computing, machine learning, and big data, etc. Therefore,
    from the trends of these data sets, a constant need is felt to revisit the current
    standings and capacities of the new age IoT concepts. The modern-day requirements
    and the counteractive substitutes in the field of agriculture and changes exactly
    to the expectations based on the concepts of IoT must be addressed. The contribution
    of IoT in the agriculture field and certain gaps in resource utilization motivated
    us to perform a study that addresses current issues and applications of IoT in
    agriculture. Agriculture is expected to get immensely fortified by the advancement
    of technology especially by the domain IoT. Precision agriculture is the new term
    appended to the agriculture filed, with all the procedures being followed, addressed,
    and simulated in a tech-driven manner. Incorporation of the internet has started
    to revolutionize this field by associating devices together, now being identified
    as the Internet of Things. Coined in 1999 by a British visionary “Kevin Ashton”,
    Internet of Things is a consortium of devices connected [7]. The devices are associated
    with internet via Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), Radio-frequency Identification
    (RIFD), Near Field Communication (NFC), Long Term Evolution (LTE), and other devices
    and communication technologies. This association helps the devices and the other
    objects transfer the information gathered to destined places all over the network.
    Precision agriculture, therefore, aims to optimize and improve agricultural processes
    to ensure optimum production with reliable, fast, and distributed dimensions thus
    providing growers a detailed overview of the ongoing scenarios in the cultivation
    stretches. This practice is followed to reduce energy consumption. The major areas
    where IoT can leave an everlasting impression are climate monitoring [8], data
    analytics [9], early disease detection [10], crop counting [11], smart irrigation
    [12], etc. With the spread of a network of devices, a communication channel can
    be established between the farmers, fields, and experts. By developing IoT based
    models, the field conditions can be monitored remotely on regular time intervals
    without any human intervention and after analyzing the data favorable and efficient
    decisions can be taken accordingly. This will help to ensure both field and market
    safety and security to the farmer. Also, with early monitoring of crops, disease
    detection can be done and thus preventive measures can be taken to save the crop
    beforehand. For producers it will also help in the analysis of consumer demands.
    Whether the product will be able to meet market expectations, thus creating an
    intelligent decision driven farming. An analysis of different existing articles
    addressing the research and development of precision agriculture is presented
    in TABLE 2. TABLE 2 Alaysis of Various Papers in the Field of Precison Agricuture
    for the Current Study In this article based on research gaps and findings obtained
    from articles analyzed below, a systematic survey is done. Therefore in this study,
    the most prominent problems of the agriculture sector, and solutions provided
    by modern systems are addressed and discussed in detail. The major contributions
    of this study are as follows: A comprehensive survey of the architectural, conceptual,
    and implementation details of IoT models adopted for Precision Agriculture has
    been carried out. Various IoT hardware platforms and other associated devices
    like sensors, accumulators, etc. along with their role in agriculture have been
    discussed in brief. Various IoT OS supported for Precision Agriculture have been
    discussed. The significance and key differences of MIoT in agriculture have been
    discussed along with related studies. Studies limited to a specific domain has
    been merged together for clear mapping of the domain. Sensors and their role in
    agriculture is discussed. Various projects/ start-up’s started all over the globe
    for tacking agricultural problems and providing intelligent and sustainable solutions
    to farmers have also been discussed. Functional concepts like limitations, improvements,
    future works and applications are discussed separately. The rest of the paper
    has been organized as in Section 2 various search and source methods used for
    the selections of relevant articles has been introduced, in Section 3 to get into
    the deep insight of the various concepts, theories, and devices related to the
    implementation of Internet of Things has been discussed, followed by Section 4
    which gives the various related studies concerning different applications of Internet
    of Things in Agriculture, findings like challenges, limitations, improvements,
    future work, etc. with a short description of our proposed work has been given
    in Section 5, and finally, at last, the article ends with a conclusion. Table
    3 gives the detailed nomenclature used throughout this article. TABLE 3 Nomenclature
    SECTION II. Sources and Search Methods The research methodology consists of going
    through articles based on the contribution of IoT and its related technologies
    for the advancement and development of the agriculture filed. For designing the
    overall structure of this article, the data and selected studies are chosen strictly
    based on a time frame. Most of the articles taken for study are sorted from 2015
    to 2020. This time frame is chosen to visualize and understand the current impact
    of IoT in the field. In TABLE 4, a summary of the resources from where the papers
    have been selected is presented. TABLE 4 Summary of the E-Reserves for Obtaining
    the Related Research Articles Given the objective of this article, research has
    been conducted thoroughly by examining the existing literature work related to
    the subject. For developing a firm foundation, the articles containing the origin
    of IoT, alongside current standings, recent trends, and technologies, were considered
    for a study concerning their contributions to the field of agriculture. By reviewing
    the existing literature, a sustainable framework has been developed to overcome
    the existing challenges in the field. The keywords mainly used to identify the
    literature included Precision Agriculture, Agriculture, Plant Monitoring, Internet
    of Things, Smart Agriculture, Smart Farming, Irrigation, Plant Pathology, Wireless
    Sensor Networks, etc. The eight-year trends of the different terminologies and
    their search significance over the years have been extracted from Google and are
    presented in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3. FIGURE 2. Worldwide distribution of IoT of the
    past eight years [19]. Show All FIGURE 3. Precision Agriculture distribution worldwide
    of the past eight years [19]. Show All From the figures, it can be seen that the
    frequency of search or usage of these two terms is somewhat stable over the past
    eight years. An average, 80% of people talk and search about these topics for
    study and other related purposes, thus establishing the growing interest worldwide
    in this area. So for a better understanding, in the next section, the various
    terminologies related to the Internet of things concepts and devise have been
    discussed. SECTION III. Introduction to the Internet of Things (IoT) Concepts
    and Theories Inspired from the technology of the internet to connect the whole
    world, the Internet of Things constitutes of things possessing unique identities
    and are connected to the internet. A cosmos of sensors, actuators, appliances,
    and other devices connected with each over the internet, results in making the
    Internet of Things (IoT). The scope of IoT is not just limited to only connecting
    things but to allow them to communicate and exchange data. Based on the Electronic
    Devices and Network Annex-IEA-4E (EDNA), by 2020 the number of connected devices
    will rise to 50 billion, thus resulting in the generation of high revenue. IoT
    works in a layered manner depending upon the problem it is addressing. Therefore,
    it can be define that IoT possesses a layered architecture [20]. All these layers
    combined are called the IoT functional blocks. Apart from the functional blocks,
    various communication models that aid the smooth working of an IoT model are a
    request-response model, publish-subscribe, push-pull, and exclusive pair [20].
    Fig. 4 represents the reference architecture of IoT in agriculture and includes
    the following layers: device/physical layer, network layer, middleware layer,
    service layer, analytics layer, and end-user layer. The layered architecture includes
    all the hardware devices, facilities, equipment, internet, communication technologies,
    protocols, and data analytic algorithms. How the layers work along with each other
    is described below: Perception Layer: Also called physical or the device layer,
    this layer lies at the bottom of the architecture and constitutes of sensors,
    actuators, microcontrollers, gateways, routers, switches, hubs, etc. The main
    role of this layer is, how efficiently the sensing devices and the other equipment’s
    can work together to gather data. The microcontroller device acts as a controller
    as it performs all the networking ifunctionalities. The microcontroller also acts
    as a network regulating body as it regulates the networks, such that the sensors
    and other devices can collect data. The main aim of this layer is to capture data
    and transfer it to the other layer i.e., the higher abstraction layers. In terms
    of agriculture, the devices in the physical layer gather, soil, water, pH value,
    humidity, leaf wetness, and other data parameters. Also, the topology in which
    the devices are placed plays a major role in power consumption and efficient data
    collection in this layer. Network Layer: It comprises of internet and other communication
    technologies. The main aim of this layer is, how to achieve better communication
    in the platform. In terms of agriculture, the design of this layer plays an important
    role in a framework due to the selection of suitable communication technologies
    relevant to field size or the test bed size. LTE, CDMA, GSM, Wi-Fi, ZigBee, LoRa,
    NFC, UWB Bluetooth, and RIFD are some of the communication technologies used for
    agriculture purposes. ZigBee, LoRa, and NFC are the most used communication technologies
    employed depending upon the problem and the area to be addressed in the agro domain.
    NFC and Bluetooth are the most suitable for the greenhouses. Various protocols
    like HTTP, WWW, and SMTP serve for efficient communication in the agricultural
    scenarios. Middleware Layer: This layer in IoT architecture is accountable for
    device management, context awareness, interoperability, portability, and security-related
    responsibilities. In terms of agriculture scenarios, HYDRA, SMEPP act as best
    middleware due to their context-aware functionalities. Service Layer: Dealing
    with agricultural problems, cloud-assisted service layer in IoT layered architecture
    plays a prominent role in providing cloud storage and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS).
    To facilitate the function of sensing, actuation, and other activities, this layer
    focuses on some main areas or domains such as monitoring, detection, control,
    decision making, recognition, etc. The service layer offers services like device
    monitoring, control, discovery, and data publishing services. Analytics Layer:
    The layer is responsible for the processing and analysis of data. This layer works
    as a consortium of two steps- 1) Data ingestion, is the step that performs storage,
    cleansing, and streaming of data and the 2) Data analytics, which performs data
    reporting, mining, and learning. In the analytics layer various machine learning
    tools, data analytic algorithms are employed to give early predictive decisions
    for measuring the crop yield, crop growth, disease detection, etc. These decisions
    can enhance farm monitoring capacity. The predictive decisions can help in the
    design of better decision support systems. End-User Layer: Being the topmost layer
    of the model, it serves the consumer or the user. To provide the interface to
    the users to control and monitor their model, this layer allows them to view the
    system status, analyze or process the data. In agro models, the farmer is the
    end-user. This layer provides a user-friendly experience and platform to the farmers.
    The services or applications in this layer are designed based on the behavioral
    study and pattern analysis of the user. Various intelligent approaches and data
    analytic studies are employed to understand the behavior of the users, as they
    come with different needs and offer a lot of diversity. Social media, Cloud computing,
    Mobile messaging are the platforms used to provide services to users, experts,
    and industries. Through this layer, the whole IoT based platform can be monitored,
    controlled, and run. The services generated from this layer are mostly the link
    between the user and the systems/platforms. FIGURE 4. A layered ecosystem/architecture
    of Agro-IoT. Show All A. Multimedia Internet of Things (MIoT) in Agriculture Based
    on the working, nature of deployment, and the subject IoT concepts are used to
    address, traditional IoT is differentiated into various forms such as IoMT, MIoT,
    IIoT, etc. Without the inclusion of these concepts, IoT systems cannot successfully
    realize the concept of ubiquitous computing. In these paradigms, the interaction
    and cooperation between the heterogeneous devices is facilitated. Due to the increase
    in the number, diversity of devices and data with time, these concepts have become
    more functional and prominent to develop models and techniques for coming challenges
    and reflect the possibilities enabled in them. All these concepts have the same
    main character of availability, intelligence, and devices but they only differ
    in their due course of action i.e., their general usage. Being an allied branch
    or extension of IoT, MIoT, include smart objects that are usually resource-constrained,
    in terms of memory, energy, and processing power. Due to the progressive reduction
    in size and cost of production of these devices, MIoT models are expected to be
    developed and deployed on a large scale. Generally, the sensors of these models
    are usually designed to be battery operated or solar power operated. Due to the
    large data sensing and analysis, these devices require high computational power.
    Mostly, the multimedia data includes audio, video, and image data, which possess
    unstructured features and is difficult to transmit and analyze on a computationally
    scarce network and low bandwidth conditions. Multimedia data shows different behavior
    compared to the scalar data due to its computational complexity and network topology
    bottlenecks to the Quality of Service (QoS). A lot of work has been done in IoT
    and its allied fields to realize the concept of heterogeneous, low-level data
    transmission, and communication. In agricultural frameworks, the data is mostly
    in the visual form e.g., pest images, plant disease images, field images, etc.
    The characteristic difference in scalar and multimedia data is shown in Fig. 5.
    FIGURE 5. Key characteristic differences between IoT and MIoT data [25]. Show
    All Depending upon the various parameters there are key differences between IoT
    and MIoT and they are discussed as: The IoT systems work mostly on non-heterogeneous
    devices while the MIoT functions well in case of heterogeneity. IoT data is mostly
    scalar, however, MIoT considers the multimedia data. Traditional IoT networks
    does not take into consideration the concept QoS while transmission and communication
    whereas in case of MIoT, QoS and QoE play a major role as the prime parameters.
    IoT can function well over low bandwidth channels whereas MIoT networks are in
    demand of high bandwidth due to bulky data. Node operation is predefined in IoT
    whereas in MIoT the node operation is adaptive in nature. Various authors have
    worked on the implementation of concepts of MIoT for agriculture. Zhang et al.
    [21], worked on the concept of preserving the concept of data confidentiality
    while realizing the challenge of low-cost data acquisition. A measurement matrix
    under the control of chaos and random subsampling is employed to capture the ruptured
    image signals. Then these sampled sub-images are assembled to form a big master
    image and then encrypted based on android transform and single value diffusion.
    Correlation, histogram, keyspace, robustness, real-time, and entropy analysis
    are performed to understand and realize the concept of low-level transmission.
    Rani et al. [22], worked on the concept of bridging the gap between the scalar
    and multimedia data, and for this, they developed an IoMT cross-layer protocol.
    This protocol considered cross-communication between the physical, data link,
    and routing layers. The main objective of this work was to achieve energy-efficient
    communication with less computational time complexity. An optimal mathematical
    model was developed to study the cross-layer behavior in all the three layers,
    therefore selecting the efficient one. A comparative study was conducted on two
    parameters like delay and distance. Usman et al. [23], proposed a multilayer framework
    based on multilevel edge computing architecture to manage, and preserve the privacy
    of end devices from external attacks. Authors mainly focused on the three major
    challenges i.e., node management, privacy-preserving, and network protection.
    The proposed architecture is divided into three layers with the first layer comprising
    of underlying network partitioned into multiple clusters to manage end-devices
    and Level-One Edge Devices (LOEDs). In the second layer, the LOEDs apply an efficient
    aggregation technique to reduce the volumes of generated data and preserve the
    privacy of end-devices. Local differential privacy-based technique is applied
    to protect the privacy of sensitive information in aggregated data. In the last
    layer, the mobile sinks are registered with a level-two edge device via a handshaking
    mechanism to protect the underlying network from external threats. Floris and
    Atzori [24], addressed the issue of evaluation of Quality of Experience (QoE)
    for IoT applications where mostly multimedia data is involved. For designing a
    layered architecture, authors first tried to analyze the QoE parameters or factors
    with applications in the relevant scenarios. Then a layered multimedia IoT architecture
    was proposed for QoE analysis by combing each of the analytic and contributing
    factors. Zikria et al. [25], presented a brief overview of the MIoT along with
    its challenges, solutions and future opportunities. The authors discussed the
    data differences between the traditional IoT and MIoT, along with the role of
    communication technologies. The demand for realizing the dream of MIoT and its
    bottlenecks were also discussed. The challenge of data collection and its impact
    over the network traffic is also discussed along with the methodologies developed
    to solve it. Nauman et al. [26], presented a comprehensive survey on the multimedia
    internet of things. Authors discussed the existing role of MIoT in concern with
    various fields like medical, agriculture, automation, and industry, etc. The importance
    of QoE and QoS for multimedia transmission over IoT channels is also discussed.
    A better need for routing and Physical-Medium Access Control (PHY-MAC) protocols
    for M-IoT was also discussed. A potential discussion on open research issues related
    to multimedia communication in IoT was presented. Alsamhi et al. [27], presented
    a survey on the role of green IoT in greener and smart cities. The authors focused
    on how the environment pollution can be controlled along with other parameters
    for making living more sustainable and green with the aid of IoT concepts. AlSkaif
    et al. [28], presented a survey on the energy efficiency of MAC protocols in low
    data rate wireless multimedia sensors. The conflicting goals of WMSN were also
    discussed. Role and challenges of multimedia data were also discussed. A focused
    analysis was performed on network parameter constraints and what techniques are
    employed to solve them. A comparison of the energy consumption of MAC protocols
    in four selected application scenarios related to smart cities and environment
    monitoring was also presented. Libo et al. [29], worked on how with the use of
    multimedia data in the form of images can be employed to detect the plant diseases.
    Rape diseases were studied as a case study. Authors also discussed the challenges
    and bottlenecks faced for the transfer of multimedia data over low bandwidth channels.
    With machine intelligence, authors also proposed a diagnostic procedure via which
    the data can be transferred over wireless multimedia sensors networks. Psannis
    et al. [30], proposed a technique for the transfer of advanced media-based smart
    big data via intelligent systems. Authors in their work addressed the problem
    of the rapid rise of devices and heterogeneity. An encoding algorithm with HVEC
    standard for performance evaluation was proposed to transfer the data intelligently.
    B. Hardware Platforms for IoT The hardware platform for IoT comprises a set of
    compatible hardware capable of running certain software. The main components of
    a hardware platform are machine language, sensors, wireless devices, programs,
    and processors, protocols, etc. The processor in a hardware platform determines
    how much fast a framework can work. To design certain new methodologies in IoT,
    various hardware platforms supported are elaborated as: 1) Raspberry Pi It is
    a series of single-board computers developed in the UK by Raspberry foundation.
    There are various families of raspberry i.e., Raspberry Pi 1, Raspberry Pi 2,
    Raspberry Pi 3, Raspberry Pi Zero, Raspberry Pi 4. All these families have different

    Arduino Mega are present in the market. Out of these the most common versions
    are Arduino Uno and Arduino Mega [32]. 3) Node MCU It is an open-source IoT platform.

    [34], [35]. 5) Banana Pi It is a low-cost credit-card-sized single-board computer
    developed by a Chinese company Shenzhen SINOVOIP Co. Ltd. The hardware design
    is hugely influenced by Raspberry Pi. It is compatible with Raspberry Pi boards

    platforms of IoT with their functional specifications are given in TABLE 5. TABLE
    5 Hardware Platforms of IoT and Their Specifications C. IoT Operating System (IoT
    OS) for Agriculture IoT operating system (IoT OS) is an operating system designed
    to perform within the constraints particular to Internet of Things devices. IoT
    OS are designed and developed in such a way that it can function under the restrictions
    of memory, size, power and processing capability. The main aim of IoT OS is to
    enable successful data transfer over the network via internet. The IoT OS for
    a particular framework is not chosen at random. Certain parameters such as footprint,
    scalability, portability, modularity, connectivity, and reliability are taken
    into consideration. As per the requirement of agriculture, a huge number of devices
    are connected having different features and also the devices have to withstand
    the different environments, the OS then to be chosen must be scalable, cost-efficient,
    and reliable. Various studies have been put forward for the role of IoT OS in
    network management and overall communication. Javed et al. [37], provided a detailed
    reviewed comparison of the operating systems designed for IoT devices based on
    their architecture, scheduling methods, networking technologies, programming models,
    power, and memory management methods, along with other features required for IoT
    OS applications. Musaddiq et al. [38], studied the role of small IoTOS in powering
    the scarce network devices. Authors also put light on the energy consumption of
    these devices. A detailed discussion on IoT devices and resource management is
    provided and some state of art IoT OSs such as Contiki, TinyOS, and FreeRTOS are
    also investigated. Baccelli et al. [39], a comprehensive review of RIOT is provided.
    The key components highlighted in this study are the kernel, hardware abstraction,
    software modularity for various configurations. The authors also discussed the
    operational aspects like system boot-up, timers, power management, and networking
    along with the relevant APIs. Zikria et al. [40], proposed a study for the management,
    challenges, and opportunities of IoT OS in managing IoT systems. The authors discussed
    the issue of interoperability, protocol functionalities to support heterogeneous
    deployment scenarios. Supported hardware and future research trends are also discussed.
    Ain et al. [41], proposed an efficient and flexible decision-making system for
    maintaining user thermal comfort with the help of intelligent sensors. Fuzzy based
    approach along with RIOT OS was developed to tackle the problem of fluctuation
    and adjustment. Results show that the proposed approach can perform 28% better
    than the existing approaches in terms of energy efficiency. Stergiou et al. [42],
    studied the transfer of metadata in the IoT networks. Authors discussed the techniques
    and open tools such as CC analyzers and simulators which can provide intelligent
    metadata transfer over a network. The experimentation was performed on CloudSim
    and Cooja emulator of Contiki OS for the testing of a single network segment.
    From the experimentation, it was found that no duplicate packet transfer occurred
    which is a good sign for multimedia data transmission. The various IoT OS with
    their functional specifications are presented in TABLE 6. TABLE 6 IoT OS Platforms
    in Agriculture and Their Specifications D. Sensors and Their Role in Agriculture
    Sensors are the devices, modules, machines or subsystems capable of detecting
    the changes or events in the environment. They also send signals back to the receiver
    end. Mostly the sensors are used with other electronics. A sensors sensitivity
    usually indicates how much change in sensor output occurs with respect to the
    change in the input quantity measurements. Most sensors possess the linear transfer
    function. The sensitivity of a sensor is defined as the ratio between the output
    signal and the measured property. The resolution of a sensor is the smallest change
    it can detect in the quantity it is measuring. In the area of agriculture, demand
    of technological solutions with high aim in rising production and quality is increasing
    day by day. Also the solutions are required which provide optimal analysis and
    sustainable methods for the field development with reduced cost and time. To sustain
    such challenges, sensor- based technologies have proven to be of much help to
    tackle the above issues and challenges. Precision agriculture is an emerging area
    where sensor based technologies are playing a major role. Since the sensors are
    a major data collection agents, they play a dynamic role in agriculture. Also,
    it is very difficult to collect the data from an agricultural field due to the
    undulating field conditions that keep on changing over time. Sensors are selected
    or designed according the problem to be addressed or needs identified by the farmers.
    Agriculturalists generally use sensors to sense the soil conditions, humidity,
    crop conditions, minerals, pH value, water levels, and sunlight, etc. The nature
    and the characteristics of the component which needs to be sensed also plays a
    major role in the development of a sensing device. With the development of technology,
    machinery and easy-to-use microcontroller platforms, the usage of sensors has
    expanded beyond the traditional fields of measurement i.e., temperature, pressure
    and flow. However, the analog sensors such as potentiometers and force sensing
    resistors are still widely in use. Pajares et al. [54], discussed the sensors
    in agriculture and forestry. In the article, various related works of the sensors
    performed by different authors in the same domain were presented. The role and
    importance of the component or substance which needs to be sensed was discussed
    along with their characteristics and specifications. The major areas focused by
    authors were soil analysis, seed growth, weed detection, forest stands and reflectance,
    machinery for effective treatments, microorganisms, pest control, seedling breeding,
    growing, state of health, positioning, navigation, safety, detection and classification.
    Zhu et al. [55], showed that LIDAR, IMU, and Encoder (x2) can be used for designing
    a prototype vehicle for the agricultural domain. The authors also discussed how
    these sensors can be used for the development and usage of that prototype in case
    of undulating surfaces and rough terrains. A complete review of the wireless sensors
    and the network applications used in agriculture is provided. The authors also
    addressed the importance of sensors in the field of agriculture. Along with the
    sensors, the communication technologies that support sensor communications are
    also mentioned by Rehman et al. [56]. The sensors used in the medical and agricultural
    fields have also been discussed. In the case of the agricultural field, the various
    conditions and circumstances affecting the data collection from sensors are addressed.
    The various types of sensors and their platforms used by different authors in
    their work are also included by Chokkareddy et al. [57]. Plageras et al. [58],
    used efficient IoT based sensor and big data analytics for secure collection of
    data and communication over a channel. In the study, smart housing or building
    was taken as case study, and the secure data collection with the sensors was performed
    and analyzed. The behavior of various sensors for data collection in different
    scenarios in terms of IoT and cloud computing was studied by Stergiou et al. [59].
    The secure communication among devices was also studied along with performance
    bottlenecks and challenges. The various sensors and their use in agriculture is
    discussed below: 1) Level Sensors They measure the substance of liquid in a cast.
    The cast can be any agricultural field, pond, water tank, etc. They measure data
    in two methodologies 1) Point level measurements: indicate only whether the constituent
    or level measured is above or below the sensing point or threshold. 2) Continuous
    measurements: specific range measurements and exact substance amount determination
    are performed by these sensors. In agricultural fields, the water level sensors,
    humidity sensors, and moisture sensors are used to measure the water content levels
    in a field. The point level sensors are used when the water content in the cast
    i.e., soil or testbed is very less i.e. in dry and arid areas, whereas the continuous
    level sensors are feasible for semi-arid locations. Some of the ultrasonic level
    sensors are also used in water treatment plants. Blank et al. [60], designed a
    low-level senor based fusion application for agricultural machinery design. 2)
    Temperature Sensor Temperature sensors measure the temperature of the environment
    or surroundings. They are of different types i.e. thermistors, thermocouples,
    resistance temperature detectors, infrared sensors, semiconductor sensors. In
    agriculture they measure the temperature variants in a field. Mahan et al. [61]
    designed an optimal temperature based field monitoring system by using a low-cost
    infrared sensor. 3) Proximity Sensors Detect the presence of nearby objects without
    any physical intervention. The sensor works by emitting an electromagnetic beam
    in the field and looks for any alterations in the signal. These are mainly employed
    in agricultural cattle grazing, counting of fruits, etc. Kim et al. [62] used
    a capacitive proximity sensor to optimize the harvest yield of fields. 4) Infrared
    Sensors Senses the changes in the environment by emitting infrared rays. They
    work in two approaches i.e., active and passive. An active IR sensor can both
    emit and detect the radiations and constitute a light-emitting diode and a receiver.
    The passive IR sensors can only detect the radiation and possess only a LED. In
    agriculture field infrared sensors can be employed to detect the presence of rodents
    in the orchards, count the number of plants or trees in the field, capturing satellite
    images of the field. Allred et al. [63], used IR sensor-based satellite imagery
    to map the findings and results of UAV to chart agricultural drainage systems.
    5) Touch Sensors Also known as tactile sensors, work on sensing the touch. They
    are low-cost sensors. In the agriculture field they can be used for the detection
    of intrusions in the field. Depending on the target and the range, there are different
    types of sensors, the same are discussed in Fig. 6 and TABLE 7 below: TABLE 7
    Sensors Based on Their Fields of Application FIGURE 6. Sensors and their types.

    is redefining the agriculture system and boosting farmers to work, is portrayed.
    Authors studied the recent developments of IoT and how it is helping in providing
    the solutions while designing an IoT system for agriculture, what strategies and
    policies need to be considered. The advanced agricultural practices such as greenhouses,
    vertical farming, hydroponic farming, and phenotyping are also explained. All
    the crop stages and potential challenges are also discussed. Farooq et al. [66],
    presented many aspects of IoT in agriculture. Authors discussed all the recent
    technologies associated with IoT along with big data analytics for the development
    of precision agriculture systems. Various network topologies, architectures, layers,
    and protocols are also presented. In context to the development of a smart farm,
    all the major components and relevant technologies were discussed. Also, the regulations,
    standardizations, and policies used by several countries to standardize IoT methods
    for agriculture have been discussed. Elijah et al. [67], gave an overview of IoT
    and data analytics technologies and practices in agriculture. The authors divided
    their study into four sections i.e., communication technology, internet, data
    storage, technology. The authors also provided an analysis and data on how the
    aforementioned sections can be employed for dealing with the diminishing agricultural
    resources. The pros and cons of various technologies such as cloud computing,
    WSN, radio frequency identification, middleware systems, etc. to their application
    in the agriculture field are also discussed. Studies on how these technologies
    can be used to develop an IoT ecosystem, with technical and business scenarios
    were also presented. Misra et al. [68], discussed the concepts and role of IoT,
    AI and big data in the field of agriculture. In the review, focus was laid on
    green- house monitoring, disease detection, usage UAV machines and drones agriculture
    and supply chain modernization, social media in food industry, food quality assessment
    and modernization for food traceability. Thakur et al. [69], reviewed articles
    of repute in the context of the employability of WSN in agriculture. The authors
    highlighted the different communication technologies and WSN technologies adopted
    for precision agriculture. The authors also discussed various sensors and their
    role in agriculture. The influence of various techniques for designing the models
    is also discussed at length. Damos [70], presented a review on the pest control
    in precision agriculture. The author discussed the various computer-aided technologies
    employed for forecasting and designing decision support systems. The challenges
    and constraints of designing the decision support system were highlighted. The
    most available and published data present online in terms of pest management was
    also discussed. A differentiation between the documented and existing decision
    support systems was highlighted. The advancement and role of the internet of things
    in precision agriculture along with the related areas where research is being
    conducted are discussed in this section. Literature including various approaches,
    techniques, and methodologies presented by the number of authors has been divided
    into different sections and are discussed as follows: A. IoT in Farm Management
    Farm management refers to the construction and implementation of decisions for
    obtaining the maximum production and profit via organizational operation of decisions.
    This area is most benefitted by automation and the implementation of new technological
    methods. With farm management agricultural practices are made informative by evaluation
    and comparison with the other developed approaches and methods. Diedrichs et al.
    [71], with the aid of machine learning and IoT sensing devices, predicted the
    occurrence of frost events. Authors designed their system based on three layers
    i.e., a group of internet-enabled devices for water data collection. The authors
    augmented the data using the synthetic minority oversampling technique due to
    its capability of reducing the occurrence of errors with the ML approaches. The
    humidity and temperature sensors were employed to collect data from five meteorological
    stations of the Mendoza Province of Argentina. For each station, the existing
    sensor data spanning from a period 2001 to 2016 was taken as a reference to collect
    the daily data. The data was divided into two sets i.e., locally available is
    the config-local and the one available globally is the config-all. Bayesian Networks
    were employed along with SMOTE and recursive portioning, to train the system.
    Jawad et al. [72], designed a wireless power transfer technology based on a drone
    charging system for smart agriculture. The authors used the concepts of magnetic
    resonator coupling and sleep/active modes of charge transfer system for designing
    the model. Authors mainly focused on how to charge wirelessly the drones and other
    equipment employed in agricultural field monitoring. The magnetic resonant coupling
    technique was considered due to its capability of high power transfer and efficiency.
    In the experimentation, authors found that the FSC coil with 150 coil turns in
    the transmitter circuit and the MTC comprising of 60 coil turns in the receiver
    (i.e. drone) accomplish the maximum transfer power and efficiency. For finding
    the accurate efficiency, the model was tested based on different load, and how
    to load misalignment changes the model behavior was also noted. Drone flight time
    was also taken into consideration and was estimated based on the adopted battery
    capacity and payload of the drone. Tseng et al. [73], proposed an intelligent
    IoT based platform for farm management. The authors took the data based on different
    plants i.e., beans, spinach, celery via sensors, and used 3D normalization on
    that data to extract the optimal/useful data. The average and variance were moved
    to obtain user data without making any visible changes in the actual data. Farmer’s
    behavior was analyzed for the application of pesticides and fertilizers. For the
    platform development SIM5320E, IoT Development Board is used along with the BH1750
    illumination sensor and BME280 temperature and moisture sensor. Bacco et al. [74],
    designed a model based on air-ground UAV communications for smart farming. Authors
    empirically and analytically developed a real test-bed implementation of IEEE
    802.15.4 based communication between unmanned aerial vehicle and ground sensors.
    The focus was laid on how to transfer data between sensors and other devices present
    on the ground in an optimized manner to ensure fewer transmission losses. From
    the experimentation, and result analysis authors found the Gilbert-Elliot model
    to be suitable to approximate the packet loss in the link at low transmission
    speeds. The authors used approximately 80,000 datasets from the testbed. Ahmed
    et al. [75], based on the concepts of fog computing and Wi-Fi-based long-distance
    networks proposed a system for smart monitoring. In comparison to the existing
    traditional models, a scalable and flexible model was designed for monitoring
    and controlling agro farms in rural areas. Authors introduced a WiLD network and
    fog computing in the existing WSN-based solutions to cover long ranges with fewer
    delays. A cross-layer based MAC and routing solution for sensing and actuating
    were proposed to reduce the network latency. Throughput, coverage range, and network
    latency of the network structure were analyzed. Liu et al. [76], by hybridizing
    the concepts of IoT, cloud computing, and data mining proposed an integrated framework
    for the agricultural field. China was considered as the territory to design and
    devise mechanisms to enhance modern agriculture as compared to the conventional
    one. Quality, safety, management, and pollution are were taken into consideration
    while designing the model. NoSql database, DynamoDB, relational database Oracle,
    and file object storage Amazon S3, were employed to provide the hybrid data storage
    design. Bai et al. [77], due to the issue of frequently changing environmental
    conditions addressed the issue of estimation and control in the greenhouse. The
    authors studied how to collaboratively deploy WSNs and actuator schemes for agriculture.
    Sensor nodes were used to conduct a local estimation with Kalman filters to enhance
    the stability and transmission of data ensuring energy optimization. Using the
    concepts of collective clustering and mutual effect, the actuator node based scheme
    is designed for the improvement of estimation speed and conversion accuracy. Parameter
    optimization is achieved through fuzzy neural networks along with the PID control
    algorithm. Jinbo et al. [78], performed research on developing a platform for
    the monitoring of a field with agricultural modernization. A system named DEMO
    was proposed by using the SpringMVC framework, MyBatis, Spring Data DynamoDB Stored
    Procedure, Paho, and other related technologies grounded on the J2EE platform.
    Open-source elements such as raspberry, IoT gateway integrated with the ZigBee
    module were used for the development of the platform and were chosen due to their
    stable and cost-efficient properties. The proposed system is capable of massive
    data processing and analysis for agricultural monitoring. RESTful interface service
    system developed on a cloud platform, ExtJs client technology, and WeChat were
    applied to develop the Demo system of an application layer. Mukherjee et al. [79],
    worked on the challenges of a decentralized and heterogeneous UAV swarm deployment.
    The work is focused on how to design and deploy a UAV in resource-constrained,
    harsh, and challenging environments. Swarm edge due to its heterogeneous nature
    and unequal data generation within its member’s results in under-utilization of
    the available computational resources. To solve this issue, the authors proposed
    a Nash bargaining-based weighted intra edge processing offload scheme which can
    reduce the problem of heavy processing in some swarm members. The proposed method
    achieves better scalability and reduced processing delays. Chen et al. [80], developed
    an IoT based inexpensive platform named ‘AgriTalk’ for precision soil farming.
    Turmeric plant was considered for cultivation and experiments were conducted to
    enhance its growth and production. Authors employed AgriTalk in developing several
    other IoT based models for the fields of Mountain Bao in Taiwan. For the study
    authors grew turmeric in three fields. The proposed model is capable of addressing
    dynamic changes in the field conditions for plants grown via in-soil cultivation.
    Automated devices like sensors, actuators with desired farming intelligence were
    employed to design the model. Manual delays for automatic control and switching
    over long distances were also addressed. From experim-entation it was found that
    the curcumin concentration in turmeric leaves after six months was elevated to
    6685.6 μM as compared to 72.1 μM thus witnessing a fivefold increase. Lopez et
    al. [81], proposed a smart system for estimation of soil parameters using an autonomous
    wireless sensor network. Phosphorus content in the soil was measured. For power
    optimization and maintaining a balance between change rate phenomena of soil throughout
    the day for phosphorous estimation, authors developed a dynamic power management
    approach. DPM was tested on both the circuit level and the system level. ANN was
    used to find the significant correlations between the soil parameters such as
    electrical conductivity, phosphorous, temperature, and humidity. Also, energy
    harvesting with the help of IoT and cloud services is proposed. Chen and Yang
    [82], provided a detailed analysis of how efficiently the systems can be developed
    for agriculture based on the techniques of data visualization, clustering, etc.
    The authors studied the significance of various parameters in the same environment
    and effects. For the promotion of efficient development of agriculture, the authors
    proved that data visualization and cluster analysis pave a way for finding the
    key technologies to be applied in modern agriculture. For time and cost optimization,
    functions such as sensing, monitoring, identification, transmission, and feedback
    can be realized using IOT platforms and they can serve as an impetus for intelligent
    agriculture. To test and develop their methodology, authors took the agriculture
    situation in the Jhinsa river basin which lies in the upper reaches of the Yangtze
    River as a testbed. This area has become the most abundant area of biological
    communities in Eurasia. For the study, the authors collected precipitation and
    temperature data. Since data was large, k-means clustering is used to analyze
    the data. Leng et al. [83], presented a study for the application of IoT in agricultural
    products supply chain management. Authors discussed in length what to take into
    consideration, while designing a structural model for the supply chain management.
    RIFD technology was considered as the key constituent for designing the model.
    Pereira et al. [84], based on the concepts of IoT developed an instrument capable
    of performing environment monitoring in a poultry farm. The authors focused on
    designing a cost efficient prototype for the poultry monitoring which provides
    affordable benefits compared to the commercial products available in the market.
    DHT22 sensors were used to collect air pressure and temperature details and CPU
    such as Wemos Mini D1with chipset ESP-8266EXwith standard Wi-Fi 2.4 Ghz connectivity
    were used to calibrate the whole model. Singh et al. [85], developed a cloud based
    autonomic system for delivering agriculture as a service via web and mobile based
    applications. For data collection IoT and other devices were used for communication
    and coordination. Fuzzy logic was used to automatically analyze agriculture. An
    architecture named Agri-info was developed to provide user services. Kolipaka
    [86], proposed a predictive analysis using cross media references for precision
    farming. Authors focused on the usage of sensors and MEMS integrated IoT for precision
    farming. The crop growth parameters such as soil state, water, weed state, crop
    quality and seed quality were also discussed. ML and big data approaches were
    applied to perform predictive analysis and thus finding method to provide optimal
    solutions to farmers. Further based upon the certain characteristics we have tabularized
    the major findings in TABLE 8. TABLE 8 Summary of Developed Methods for Farm Management
    B. IoT in Irrigation Irrigation is the method of application of controlled water
    to the farming fields, at needed intervals. Irrigation has been a constant area
    where a lot of energy, money, and labor is invested in the case of farming. Detection
    and knowledge of water level can reduce the cost of production by half. For increasing
    crop yield, smart irrigation management is essential. Various optimized and precise
    methods have been developed by various academicians. Klein et al. [96], with the
    help of satellite images, worked on the implementation of closed-loop irrigation.
    The authors designed a real-time water requirement system, which can optimize
    water delivery for 140 cells located in four hectares of land. Vegetative indexes
    were calculated for analyzing the total water consumption and how via loops this
    facility can be automated. Through this study and experimentation it was found
    that with the integration of closed-loop strategy and advanced water analysis,
    the overall water consumption efficiency can be improved. Alahi et al. [97], extended
    research to design and develop a smart nitrate monitoring system for the monitoring
    nitrate content in the surface and groundwater. The authors proposed a portable
    sensing system with the help of a planar inter-digital sensor, associated electronics,
    instrumentation, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy-based analysis. Through
    real-time monitoring and sending data directly to the IoT web server, the proposed
    system possesses the capacity to monitor the impact of industrial, urban, and
    agricultural activity on water content and quality. The system also ensures distributed
    monitoring. Daskalakis et al. [98], used leaf sensing technology instead of ground
    soil monitoring for knowing the plant water stress. The authors proposed a low
    cost and low power consumption leaf moisture sensing model by sensing the leaves
    with the new plant backscatter sensor node/tag. The developed tag collects the
    information from a leaf via analog and digital conversions and then the data is
    transferred via remote communication to a low-cost software-defined radio reader
    using monostatic backscatter architecture. The data collected from this node is
    then connected to the irrigation system. The proposed system is powered by a flexible
    solar panel. Jayalakshmi and Gomathi [99], proposed a sensor-cloud based precision
    agriculture for intelligent water management, to enhance crop production. For
    the model design, moisture and stress levels of different plant organs were considered
    along with the behavior vegetative and reproductive organs cell growth, and its
    effects on the water requirement were studied. The dimensionality reduction technique
    was employed to choose the optimal parameters. For the case study, the wheat plant
    was taken. The effect of soil temperature and water suction rate was studied in
    the case of the plant growth. The non-adsorbing testbed was prepared by exploding
    the sand grains at high temperatures. With the aid of WSN, it was monitored when
    the plant needs to be irrigated. Angelopoulos et al. [100], developed a small
    scale smart irrigation prototype for a strawberry greenhouse. The prototype possesses
    off the shelf hardware and software requirements and was tested on large farms
    having multiple crops to get a data gain. The reference architecture also targets
    edge data distribution. The model was tested in Greece and its performance was
    compared against the traditional existing strawberry greenhouse methods for irrigation.
    Compared to the cloud-based approaches, and their incompetence to handle network
    traffic, security challenges, and data sharing with the third party, this model
    is secure and reliable and can handle large datasets. Dominguez-Nino et al. [101],
    worked on how to integrate sensors for developing automated software tools to
    undertake the routine tasks and decision-making involved in scheduling irrigation.
    The authors also focused on the suitability of capacitance approach soil moisture
    sensors and how to automatically interpret them and providing feedback to the
    scheduling algorithm. The proposed approach was tested in the apple orchards located
    at the IRTA-Lleida Experimental Station in Mollerussa, Lleida, Spain. For the
    study, both the physiological and agronomic properties were taken into consideration
    while experimentation. Krishnan et al. [102], designed an automated irrigation
    method. The authors developed a fuzzy logic-based system for precision irrigation
    by using Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) service to enable farmers
    to water the fields. Soil and temperature, humidity, and motor status parameters
    were monitored and taken for the study. For the efficiency evaluation of the system,
    a comparison was done between the proposed system, drip irrigation, and manual
    flooding. Harun et al. [103], designed an environment-friendly system named “Greenhouse
    Irrigation Management System” for precision irrigation in agriculture. Some critical
    environmental parameters such as soil moisture, pH, temperature, humidity are
    measured with the use of WSNs to make decisions. The sensors measure the data
    and based on certain threshold value result, the fields are irrigated. Olivo [104],
    focused on the problems associated with device growth and its effects on the control
    decisions. To address this issue, an architecture named “Rules Engine and Context
    Event Processor (RECEP)” is proposed for the dynamic processing of events originated
    in the context of IoT and PA. In this model the concept if optimization was used
    to optimize the resources to increase agricultural production. The experimental
    setup was set in a banana field located in Machala-Ecuador. The given model was
    designed for operating in low-cost infrastructures for both small and large producers.
    Marcelino et al. [105], based on the work and issues of small family farmers,
    proposed a low-cost system for control, monitoring, and automation of agricultural
    greenhouse. The proposed model was designed by prototyping Raspberry Pi and Arduino
    along with sensors. Temperature, humidity, and light sensors are used for the
    field data collection. The web human interface was developed for interaction between
    the system and the farmers. Koksal and Tekinerdogan [106], developed an automatic
    farm management information system capable of performing data acquisition, processing,
    monitoring, planning, and decision making and managing the farm fields. The authors
    tested their models on two case studies on smart farming in Turkey, one for smart
    wheat in Konya and other greenhouses in Antalya. The feature-driven domain analysis
    model is designed based on IoT reference architectures and data modeling approaches.
    The system was capable of performing all farming related functions, such as irrigation,
    crop monitoring, etc. Hate et al. [107], designed a vegetable traceability system
    with smart irrigation. The field parameters like soil moisture, humidity, water
    supply control, and temperature of particular farmland are monitored with sensors
    such as water level, humidity, soil moisture, and temperature sensors. With IoT,
    the cost is reduced and efficiency is improved. Agale and Gaikwad [108], focused
    on the problem of water reduction in farmlands. An IoT based automatic system
    is designed to collect, analyze, and monitor the real-time sensor data every 10
    seconds from soil and environment and provide irrigation solutions based on that.
    The parameters like temperature, humidity, soil moisture were considered for data
    collection. The proposed method achieved 92.24 % accuracy in water-saving strategy.
    Huan et al. [109], designed a system for monitoring of water in aquaculture ponds.
    To design the system authors used the concept of narrowband IoT (NB-IoT). The
    system used STM32L151C8 microcontroller, sensors and other devices for real time
    data collection and other services. The system was implemented and tested in ChangZhou,
    JiangSu Province, China and performed with low error rate. Vij et al. [110], developed
    a smart precision irrigation system based on the concepts of IoT and machine learning.
    The main aim of authors was to develop a computationally efficient and low cost
    system. Raspberry Pi and Arduino Mega 3 were used as microcontroller and other
    sensors were used to fabricate the system. Compared to the existing systems, the
    proposed system is computationally efficient. The various findings of this section
    have been tabularized in TABLE 9. TABLE 9 Summary of IoT Based Developed Methods
    for Irrigation C. IoT in Crop Monitoring Crop monitoring is the process or method
    of observing the farm fields and crops for enhancing productivity and reducing
    cost. This can be performed with satellites, drones, sensors, and other methods.
    Vegetative indexes of an area can also play a major role in crop monitoring by
    providing the data related to the exact area of land under cultivation etc. With
    crop monitoring the estimated time of harvest can be predicted. de Souza et al.
    [118], proposed an integrated framework with the combination of hardware, software,
    middleware, and other equipment to monitor the testbed. The authors also recorded
    the testing of each equipment in the seed test labs. An IoT based system was developed
    where soil sensors provided the relevant information/data for the growth of seeds.
    Testing was performed in the Official Seed Analysis Laboratory (OSTL) of the Brazilian
    Agricultural Research Corporation. Rekha et al. [119], developed a WSN based framework
    for sensing agricultural characteristics and then provide decisions to the farmers.
    Based on the data collected, the model will provide decisions for irrigation and
    crop monitoring. For the case study, India was taken into consideration due to
    its large farming area and population dependence on agriculture. Groundnut farming
    was studied in this work. Becker Reshef et al. [120], proposed a remote sensing
    analysis based crop monitoring system for strengthening agricultural decisions
    and improving crop security. The authors named this model as “GEOGLAM” model which
    ensures the decision support of all the necessary steps for crop security and
    analysis. Kamath et al. [121], proposed a wireless sensor-based model for monitoring
    the growth of weeds in paddy crop. The authors performed a study on how Raspberry
    Pi and WSN can be modeled for precision agriculture. Raspberry Pi based model
    was deployed to monitor crop along with the integration of Bluetooth 4.0 to send
    signals from visual sensors to the base station. A solar cell battery was used
    to provide power to the system. At the remote station, the images of the crops
    were processed to extract the background and foreground objects. Classification
    between weeds and paddy crop was performed with SVM. Rao and Sridhar [122], Developed
    an automatic irrigation system by prototyping Raspberry Pi and other IoT devices
    to enhance crop productivity. A cloud-based data collection system supported by
    sensors used for data collection is employed to collect the field data. The data
    collected is sent to the base station and based on that data, the decisions are
    made. Parameters like humidity, soil temperature, and sunlight availability are
    measured. Geng et al. [123], for greenhouse environment monitoring proposed a
    four-layer IoT based mobile system. To design the system, the authors proposed
    integration of both Raspberry Pi and Arduino chip in the design where the former
    serves as the data server and later as the master chip for a mobile system. Fabrication
    of all the sensors, actuators, and other devices was done on a single board, thereby
    reducing the device’s physical distances for better performance due to serial
    communication. A dedicated communication protocol with CYC was designed to reduce
    transmission errors and data loss. Shadrin et al. [124], designed an intelligent
    agriculture IoT equipment to monitor the crop. The authors designed the system
    using the test case of monitoring the seed germination. The proposed model was
    fabricated with the integration of low power embedding wireless sensor nodes with
    artificial intelligence. CNN was used to train the model along with the collection
    of data via sensor nodes of the different stages of germinated seeds. A 3D clustering
    analysis was used to analyze the relationship between environmental factors and
    farmer issues. Uddin et al. [125], focused on developing a system for monitoring
    crops from the stage of seed germination to harvest. For this authors proposed
    a resource optimized fast health crop monitoring system. Saudi Arabian agriculture
    was taken into consideration as a case study. IoT and drones were harnessed to
    make an efficient agricultural monitoring system. Data collection methods were
    used to collect data from heterogeneous devices arranged in localized clusters.
    The system was designed to withstand a harsh environment with agility and feasibility.
    Feng et al. [126], proposed a crop growth and nutrition diagnostic system based
    on hyperspectral remote sensing. Color canopies obtained from images captured
    with satellites, UAV, and remote sensing were used to determine the index of yield.
    To determine the color canopy of plants, the color correlation was employed. Cen
    et al. [127], discussed the usage of UAV with dual image frame cameras to estimate
    the aboveground biomass and panicle biomass of rice. The authors conducted their
    study at different growth stages of the crop. The field investigations were made
    on the variations in typical vegetation indices. The accuracy of the model was
    obtained with the extraction of RGB images at two different stages. Random forest
    was employed to obtain AGB as well as the PB. Khan and Kumar [128], proposed a
    framework for the monitoring the crop field. To make their study reliable, the
    authors monitored weather in real-time to get an idea of how to provide an ambient
    condition to farm. Production increase techniques are also proposed for precision
    farming. To overcome the problems of delay in information transfer from the field
    to the farmer, the context-based agricultural mobile sink is designed in WSN.
    Thus the mobile sink node introduction improves the overall efficiency and energy
    consumption of the model. Frontward communication area (FCA) based route selection
    is proposed to reduce energy consumption and delay. Min and Kuang [129], designed
    a system for monitoring the rice crop field. The analysis of the growth of rice
    and rice duck in real-time is done by obtaining the data via the Internet of Things.
    Authors comprehensively viewed the rice and rice duck plant species and the ambient
    farm conditions required for their growth. Qiulan et al. [130], estimated the
    production of carbon from the crop growth. The authors provided a framework for
    the estimation of organic carbon compounds in the farmland soil. The wheat plant
    was taken as a test case in this study. The model provided the real monitoring
    of the farm for carbon production with the aid of IoT and other devices. The real-time
    data was collected from the Yanzhou District of Jining City, Shandong Province,
    China. Harun et al. [131], proposed an improved crop monitoring system based on
    IoT concepts. Brassica Chinensis is the plant taken for study and was subjected
    to four different light treatments such as pulse treatment, continuous treatment,
    high intensity, and artificial control for enhancing the plant growth. The authors
    also analyzed parameters such as leaf count, height, dry weight, and chlorophyll
    a and b. An intelligent embedded system was developed to monitor and capture real-time
    data. Alonso et al. [132], designed an intelligent edge IoT based platform for
    precision livestock and crop monitoring in a dairy farming scenario. In their
    study, authors used the concepts of AI, blockchain technology, edge computing
    and IoT concepts for designing the platform. The architecture named Global Edge
    Computing Architecture (GCEA) was tried and tested in real time in a dairy farm.
    Castellanos et al. [133], proposed a narrowband IoT (NB-IoT) system for collection
    of soil parameters to monitor the potato crop health and growth. A UAV aided network
    is used to support the purpose. The architecture proposed accessed the real filed
    scenario of a potato filed near Bogota, Columbia. The main achievement of this
    work was the energy harnessing due to optimal topology applied for the deployment
    of sensors across the field and thus making the battery last for 82 hours for
    above ground sensors and 77 months for the deep buried sensors. Shafi et al. [134],
    presented a multimodal for crop health monitoring based on the concepts remote
    sensing, IoT and ML. Authors conducted their research in Pakistan. Sensors were
    deployed in fields to collect the real time data. Multispectral data from drones
    presented a NDVI and was used to analyze the crop based on its chlorophyll content.
    Variable length time series data captured from IoT devices and sensors were used
    to generate crop health maps. Deep neural networks were implemented for classification
    and provided the optimal classification. Some studies of the articles incorporating
    IoT in fields related to crop monitoring are presented in TABLE 10. TABLE 10 Summary
    of Developed Methods Crop Monitoring D. IoT in Disease Detection Diseases play
    a vital role in the economic and food crisis of a country. So to avoid this, disease
    detection is employed. This involves the detection of various diseases whether
    fungal, viral, bacterial, etc. from the stages of early to the post-harvest. Incubation
    of IoT has revolutionized the disease detection area in plant phenotyping resulting
    in major control resources available to avoid disease occurrence. Wang et al.
    [146], focused on addressing the problem of pests and insects. Authors proposed
    an IoT based model that can detect the early occurrence of the pests and diseases
    from visual references. Rough set theory algorithm and NN were used to model design.
    The proposed model was compared with existing models for accuracy and efficiency.
    Pandiyan et al. [147], applied the concepts of image segmentation and IoT, to
    develop a system/platform that can detect the diseases in plants. Authors proposed
    a novel platform having an Advanced Segmented Dimension Extraction (ASDE) with
    Heterogeneous Internet of Things procedural (HIoT) aspects, to detect the apple
    leaf diseases. A sign based plant disease identification model for real-time resembling
    of leaf diseases namely bacteria, fungi, micro-organisms, and viruses is presented.
    Three levels i.e. connectivity level, platform level, and service level were employed
    for performing data aggregation, transmission, and automatic identity identification.
    Leaf gestures were studied to identify the diseases in leaves. Zhao et al. [148],
    developed an automatic crop disease detection system capable of identifying and
    recognizing the leaves from a cluttered background. Combining IoT concepts and
    CNN, authors designed a novel approach named “Multi-Context Fusion Network (MCFN)”
    along with IoT deployments for crop diseased detection in wild. Kale and Sonavane
    [149], developed a smart and optimized smart fertilizing decision support system
    for smart farming. The authors addressed the problem of disproportion due to lack
    of judgment. Concepts of IoT and GA were used to design the system. An improved
    GA based multilevel parameter optimized feature selection algorithm for ELM classifier
    along with IoT was proposed in the designed system. The proposed system focuses
    on plant disease detection in a real-time environment. Khattab et al. [150], developed
    an IoT based cognitive automatic monitoring system for detecting the epidemic
    diseases in plants. By combining the concepts of artificial intelligence and prediction
    algorithms to develop the expert system, capable of predicting, analyzing, and
    decision making. A layered approach was used to design the model. Soil, leaf wetness,
    wind speed, and wind direction sensors were employed to gather the data. The model
    was tested on detection of the diseases like Late Blight, Early Blight, and Powdery
    Mildew in tomato and potato crops. Chen et al. [151], based on AI technologies
    and IoT, developed a system named “RiceTalk” for the detection of Blight diseases
    in the rice plant. AgriTalk model was used as a base model in this work to develop
    this system. Compared to AgriTalk, the authors used non-image IoT devices to design
    this model for disease detection. Devi et al. [152], proposed a simple and efficient
    IoT enabled solution for developing a system for automatic disease detection.
    Bunchy top of banana and Sigatoka diseases in the wild banana plant were detected
    and classified. Environmental parameters like soil moisture, temperature were
    measured with sensors and the IoT model was framed using the Raspberry PI hardware
    model. Data were classified using GLCM and RFC for disease detection. Kitpo and
    Inoue [153], developed an early disease detection system for rice crops disease
    detection. The drones based IoT architecture with real-time data collection capabilities
    was designed. For the mapping of drones on the fields, GPS sensors were used.
    The designed system is capable of displaying the analytical results and the position
    of the plant where the disease is present. Pawara et al. [154], studied the pomegranate
    diseases such as Bacterial Blight, Fruit Spot, Fruit Rot, and Leaf Spot. Developed
    a HMM and senor based model to early detect the disease and provide the solutions.
    Parameters like air temperature, leaf wetness, air humidity, and soil wetness
    were considered and studied for model design. For digital communication between
    field and farm GSM module was used. Truong et al. [155], real-time data monitoring
    capable system was designed with IoT and cloud storage for disease detection and
    recognition. The fungal diseases of rural crop fields with detected. Environmental
    data conditions such as humidity, temperature, wind speed, and rainfall were employed
    for designing decision support. A Support Vector Machine Regression (SVMr) model
    was used to classify the data. Jumat et al. [156], developed a cost-efficient
    and affordable smart farming prototype capable of detecting plant disease and
    proving decisions. For study and experimentation, Septoria plant disease was taken
    and studied for different stages right from outbreak to spread maturity. The system
    also possesses the web-enabled facilities for farmer support. Some studies of
    the articles incorporating IoT in fields related to disease detection are presented
    in TABLE 11. TABLE 11 Summary of IoT Based Developed Methods for Disease Detection
    SECTION V. Findings Several research articles related to the role and responses
    of the Internet of Things in agriculture have been studied. From the literature
    and studies, it can be seen that immense contribution has made by IoT in the field
    of agriculture starting from micro areas and moving over to macro environments.
    Internet of Things along with the concepts of cloud computing, cluster computing,
    wireless sensor networks and computer vision has revolutionized the field of monitoring,
    crop production, disease detection, and supply chain management. Since the domain
    of agriculture itself is a wide domain so considering the impact IoT has or can
    make on this field, the search was not restricted or limited to any area. The
    data acquisition for agriculture systems is a multidimensional approach. There
    are several fields in agriculture where IoT is applied e.g., crop monitoring,
    diseased detection, precision irrigation, supply chain, cattle grazing, and raising,
    etc. To design a precision approach, the target plays a very important role in
    data collection. From the existing studies it is found that mostly overall 90%
    of the data is self-acquired by the authors with the use of wireless sensors.
    This data included soil data, pH values, light, water, humidity, and images. In
    the case of crop disease detection, leaves were taken as the primary subject of
    study due to their ease of availability and quantity. Nearly 80% of the leaf data
    was self-acquired using digital cameras and web-enabled devices. However in some
    studies to validate their models, authors also used the existing standard ground
    truth databases available. Satellite imaging and remote sensing images were also
    taken to understand the demography and vegetative indexes of a region. UAV drones
    were the most used devices along with web-enabled digital cameras and mobile devices
    to capture the data in the form of images and also acted for providing real-time
    monitoring of device location in the fields. Certain issues and challenges are
    faced by the authors while capturing real-time images due to environmental and
    lighting conditions. To avoid these issues, laboratory-based testbeds such as
    greenhouses were developed and their data was acquired in a closed environment.
    From the literature, it is seen that, to develop the prototypes certain common
    parameters were taken for conducting the study irrespective of the problem to
    be addressed. Theses parameters included soil data, pH value, humidity level,
    moisture content, water content. After the analysis of the studies it was found
    that for any agricultural system to flourish all these parameters play a combined
    role. These parameters were most common for the problems addressing farm management,
    crop monitoring, and irrigation. However in certain other parameters like leaf
    wetness, salinity, disease severity, fertilizer ratio, plant height, CO2 content,
    mineral content, and conductivity were considered while addressing the specific
    problems like plant disease detection, smart irrigation, seedling germination,
    etc. These were the devices employed to collect the data. Depending upon the problem
    the authors addressed, different type of sensors were employed. For soil data
    collection, the contact method sensors such as hygrometers, or electrodes which
    penetrate the soil were used to collect soil information. While as in the case
    of the collection of soil information via tractors or vehicles non-contact soil
    sensors were employed. But for the studies it can be seen that contact method
    sensors are the most common devices used for soil data collection. In case of
    soil pH value and salinity electrochemical sensors are employed. In the case of
    soil nitrates, CO2, and fertilizer content, topsoil depth, biomass content, organic
    matter are measured. For water data collection, parameters like relative humidity,
    leakage of pipes, dissolved oxygen, nitrates, and other oxides were measured by
    the authors. To accomplish this various water sensors like ultrasonic sensors
    were employed to measure the water levels in the tanks, ponds, and farms. Temperature
    and humidity sensors were used to measure the temperature of water and humidity
    of soil for water content. In the case of plant leaves, the leaf wetness sensors
    were employed to understand the moisture content of the plants. Other than these
    sensors, neutron sensors, time travels sensors, and capacitance sensors are also
    employed by some authors for measuring the water levels. In the case of supply
    chain and cattle grazing, tags and biosensors were employed to gather the data.
    To develop the prototypes, the authors used the devices based on functional capabilities.
    From all the devices, Arduino and Raspberry Pi were the most desirable hardware
    platforms for the authors. Arduino was employed to tackle simple or sequential
    issues that do not require complex solutions. In the case of scenarios with complex
    environments, Raspberry Pi boards were employed due to their capability of addressing
    multiple problems at the same time. For functionalities that faced time issues,
    Raspberry Pi boards were employed. In the case of communication technologies,
    LoRa and ZigBee are the most commonly used communication technologies by the authors
    in the platform designs due to their capabilities of handling a multitude of solutions.
    Lora and ZigBee use GPS to enable and detect geo-locations. They are low cost
    and secure for data transmission. Other than these technologies, authors also
    made use of cloud and cluster computing to handle a large mass of data and provide
    on-spot solutions to the consumers. The authors performed the processing of data
    in different stages. At first preprocessing on data was performed to remove any
    kind of outliers or anomalies in the data. To remove the imperfect data, algorithms
    such as noise removal with Gaussian noise, salt and pepper noise, histogram equalization
    were commonly used for the preprocessing of image data. However in the case of
    numerical data missing value imputation, the banana dataset for noise reduction
    was employed. To obtain the optimal data from a given set of data, data reduction
    was performed. The data reduction approaches e.g., dimensionality reduction, attribute
    subset selection, numerosity reduction, etc. were employed by various authors.
    To make systems capable of taking decisions, several learning algorithms like
    GA, CNN, NN, SVM, PNN, GANs were used to train and test the models. From the literature,
    it is seen that most studies and experiments were performed in countries that
    have agricultural economies like the USA, China, India, Brazil, Australia, etc.
    Most of these countries are economically stable and first world countries. They
    have better infrastructure and service availability. Also only 20% of the studies
    were focused on real-time implementation of their prototypes which indicates that
    most of the experimentation was conducted in a closed environment. This pattern
    raises concerns on how these studies can be employed in real-time environments
    with low infrastructure and maintenance costs. The problem of power consumption
    was also addressed by some studies. However there were no comparisons and reasons
    given on how the dream of IoT can be made real for poor and self-financing farmers.
    Along with this, a few studies provided the cost estimation for the deployment
    of the models. In the Fig. 7, the percentage distribution and contribution of
    IoT in different fields of agriculture are shown. From the figure it can be seen
    that more extensive studies are conducted in the field of crop monitoring. FIGURE
    7. Percentage contribution of IoT in different fields of agriculture. Show All
    These studies and analysis put forth by different articles show that current/existing
    solutions have incorporated IoT to solve several challenges in the agricultural
    domain. With the incorporation of these technologies, a large number of challenges/factors
    for improvement have emerged. Along with the study of factors for improvement,
    future research directions, applications are also highlighted. The sections below
    explain the factors for improvement and the futuristic research directions. A.
    Challenges Despite the growth achieved by IoT over the past few decades, there
    still exist some conceptual, fundamental, and developmental issues. 1) Cost Designing
    a cost-optimized model is still a difficulty faced by many authors. Scientists
    are focusing on developing cost-efficient systems by reducing the hardware and
    software requirements in IoT deployments. Economic differences of countries make
    it difficult for farmers to deploy devices and technology. So, it is important
    to develop some economic models. 2) Standardization To fully utilize the technology
    for large range of applications, standardization of devices is essential. The
    present or current mechanisms do not confirm any standardization formats either
    for the data and process representation. Deprived of the cordial use of the semantic
    ontologies, machine-readable codes result in output differences due to misinterpretation
    and alterations from time to time. With standardization the interoperability issues
    of the devices, applications, systems and products can be solved. 3) Heterogeneity
    While designing a system, heterogeneous devices are used. Every device differs
    in processes and services requirements. In the case of agriculture, most models
    perform with heterogeneous devices, so it is important to create interaction between
    heterogeneous modules and communication technologies. Because of heterogeneity,
    the complexity of the network increases, and sometimes falsified results may appear.
    4) Accessibility For developing any farming decision support system based on IoT
    technology and other devices, the demand for availability of existing software
    and hardware to be present anywhere any time is a must thing. These problems need
    to be addressed to ensure the availability of services anywhere and anytime. Lack
    of availability of the required equipment can result in chaos and delay in the
    services. 5) Adaptability While designing a model, especially for precision farming,
    it is pertinent for the devices to be adaptable with the other devices and the
    surroundings. Since the environmental conditions keep varying and also sometimes
    due to certain communication or hardware issues certain devices are not adaptable
    with each other. 6) Energy Optimization Energy is the most emerging issue in IoT
    systems, WSNs, and other devices for their communication. Till now conventional
    sources of energy have been supporting the designing and working models. But due
    to an increase in devices, the consumption of conventional energy is not a reliable
    solution. Non-conventional sources of energy like solar, wind, water energy harvesting
    schemes should also be tested, but they haven’t been of much success and new methodologies
    should be developed to employ them for model development. 7) Compatibility To
    achieve the standards of fragmentation and scalability, the developed models or
    software should be flexible and should run on any machine. 8) Reliability For
    successful and smooth working, reliability is a major concern for IoT devices
    in terms of data transmission. The devices need to gather and transfer reliable
    data as based on the data received and interpreted, the decisions are made. Reliability
    is still a challenge due to system failures, node failures, battery issues, or
    other interventions. 9) Mobility Generally the systems or models developed are
    static. For smooth implementation of the framework, there should be mobility as
    most of the devices and applications are mobile. In mobile models, the issue of
    maintaining connectivity is still a difficult task. 10) Environmental Conditions
    In agriculture there are different landforms. So it becomes difficult to adapt
    to those changes, and this also jeopardizes data and services. This alters the
    accuracy of a system. 11) Real-Time Deployment Most of the studies put forward
    are not employed or tested in a real-time testbed. So before deploying a system
    or model, real-time analysis is a must, to avoid post-deployment losses. B. Improvements
    Since the growth of IoT is remarkable in the field of agriculture, certain improvements
    can be included in the growth and developmental state to make the systems and
    models more efficient, reliable, and business-oriented. 1) Warding Off the Performance
    Degradation Generally while developing systems, customer interaction or input
    is not taken. As the models serve a variety of customers from dynamic backgrounds,
    therefore their input must be taken while developing the models. This way the
    performance hazards and chaos that occurs on the filed can be avoided. 2) Sharing
    Rich Data Globally In almost all, the IoT based models designed for precision
    farming, the data sharing while integrating and mapping the system design should
    be encouraged. This can lead to the development of an interactive model globally.
    This feature can also help in understanding the topographic and demographic challenges
    of various regions on a global level. Thus the suitable solutions can be designed
    with those working in resource-constrained environments. 3) Moving Towards High-Speed
    Communication The communication domain itself is witnessing a progressive and
    dynamic shift. Since the IoT models are remotely located, so better communication
    is a prerequisite. Therefore it is important to consider high-speed communication
    strategies like 5G, for making the devices more reachable with lesser delays.
    4) Cost Analytic Studies for Model Design With the incumbent of IoT in agriculture,
    a variety of models are designed for addressing different domains such as irrigation,
    farm management, disease detection, and crop monitoring, etc. While designing
    the models various case studies are performed. As the development cost of models
    for these cases varies from country to country i.e., in first world countries
    there will be the different cost of devices and in second and third world countries
    it will be different. Therefore a model cost analysis will provide an idea of
    the purchasing power and investment a farmer from these varied economic regions
    can invest to develop a model. Also this can result in seeking or considering
    other cheaper and efficient ways to develop models. C. Future Research Directions
    With the advancement in the development of precision agriculture platforms with
    IoT and other technologies, the development of new applications or research areas
    is envisioned. After the study of the literature, certain potential concepts and
    futuristic research directions are listed and discussed below: Design of platforms
    in a user-friendly manner (from farmers’ perspective and ease of using) using
    Artificial Intelligence and other learning tools. Farmer’s perspective here means
    that an audit should be done well before designing the prototype. From this study
    a clear insight and differences between the requirements of the farmers and farming
    systems across the globe can be understood. To develop concepts and methodologies
    based on multidimensional aspects like science, expertise, experience, industry,
    etc. Energy harvesting or power optimization methodologies should be developed
    to reduce the cost of production, maintenance, and fault tolerance. It is evident
    that mostly the farms be it small or large, require power and energy for the working
    of devices. In most of the cases, the power to the devices is supplied from the
    main line or the power grid. But this is not a sustainable and efficient method.
    Thus in order to make farms self-reliant, the energy harvesting or power optimization
    approaches should be developed or incorporated while designing of the models.
    Induction of cloud sources for data gathering and processing in a reliable, systematic,
    and scientific manner. Develop systems that can withstand variable soil and environmental
    conditions. Since the agricultural environments are harsh and keep on changing
    with change in climatic conditions or seasons. So it is essential to develop systems
    which can be robust and sustainable to the changes in the external as well as
    internal factors. Development of user or farmer friendly apps for monitoring crop
    and plant health. Mostly farmers come different ethnic and linguistic backgrounds.
    So due to this their level of understanding and ways to perform agricultural tasks
    is also different. It is important to develop frameworks considering the native
    language of a region into consideration so the farmer and machine interaction
    can be improved. This will enhance enable the acceptance of precision farming
    methods easy as it can be seen some areas are reluctant to adopt due to this linguistic
    and understanding problems. Development of efficient sensor-based systems for
    high elevation areas. High elevation areas mostly have undulating surfaces and
    also in most of the countries, supply of power to these areas is still a dream.
    Form the literature, it can be seen that these areas have not been targeted for
    precision farming instead of being resource deficient. Therefore deployment and
    design of sensor based systems in these areas opens a scope in future of precision
    farming. Usage of previous and existential scientific data for the development
    of decision support systems in farming. Generally for designing the precision
    farming models, the primary data is considered. However for designing cost efficient
    and reliable models, the previous case studies and deployment models should be
    considered for the study. This means a collaborative model development methodology
    should be developed for understanding the nature of the work. To recognize various
    plant species using mixed data sets or heterogeneous data. Design of a portable
    and sustainable farming equipment control systems for large as well as small farms.
    Mostly from the study it can be seen that first world countries are welcoming
    in PA approaches while as in most third world and other nations, this concept
    is still in avoidance due to cost and shelf life of products and equipment’s.
    Development of reliable supply chain management methods for precision farming.
    D. Applications of IoT in Agriculture IoT has revolutionized the world of agriculture,
    and a manifold of application can be derivative of implementation of the Internet
    of Things in agriculture. These applications are a resultant of the architectural
    design chosen. These applications have been categorized and differentiated based
    on the subject they focus on and also the service they provide. The major sectional
    areas where IoT is applicable in agriculture are- observation, data collection
    and corroboration, governing, and management. Most of these fields work collaboratively,
    and all the applications involve at least two of these sections. All these sections
    are described below and TABLE 12 presents various IoT applications in agriculture.
    TABLE 12 Applications of IoT in Agriculture 1) Observation It is also called monitoring
    as the main aim of this section is to discern the working of various models, devices,
    applications, etc. With the incubation of the concept of IoT, it is the first
    and foremost stage to be smeared. In this phase, all the devices and equipment
    that are placed strategically are monitored for their work. Sensors, are the major
    deployment and data collection tools engaged in this phase for data collection
    of various field and non-field parameters. Monitoring the certain parameters,
    like soil salinity, pH value, volumetric water content by using various soil sensors
    and other essential parameters such leaf wetness sensors, color, humidity, etc.
    helps in the development of systems capable of performing following operations
    e.g., calculation of leaf area index, leaf health, leaf color, plant growth and
    aid in the development of automatic plant recognition systems. Other devices like
    water sensors aid in the monitoring of irrigation levels and requirements of the
    fields. Thus with such devices, smart irrigation scheduling systems are developed.
    Also with the gas sensors, remote monitoring devices such as UAV devices or images
    with hyperspectral reflectance properties, help in the estimation of biomass,
    nitrogen, carbon, and other essential gases content. This data can also be used
    to find the vegetative indexes of the filed or large demography. Heavy-duty vehicles
    such as thrashers, tractors, trucks etc., also need supervision and can use data
    analytics for farm management. Robots, autonomous vehicles, agricultural drones
    other equipment also need to be monitored remotely for better farm supervision.
    Livestock monitoring with the aid of IoT is also an important subject for precision
    farming. It includes cattle monitoring remotely using tags. Labour is also a major
    area of concern for precision farming. Since human intervention is generally prone
    to errors due to differences in understanding, decision making, and methodologies
    applied to solve a particular problem. Also the induction of human labor is cost-intensive.
    Therefore, with the application of IoT, human interference can be minimized and
    a network can be set up for monitoring thus reducing the errors and cost. 2) Data
    Collection and Corroboration Data is the main constituent of precision farming.
    It acts as both base and catalyst in the whole process. With IoT, a large number
    of data is collected in varying forms and formats. Sensors, cameras, and various
    other nodes aid in the collection of data. In precision agriculture, based on
    the nature of the problem, the IoT network can be designed and formulated to collect
    different types of data. After the data is collected, the corroboration also called
    documentation of the data is very important for better understanding. Corroboration
    is a natural application of collected data, but certain additions of different
    samples such as manual or machine integration are also seen. Data once collected
    needs to be refined and understood, labeled, and thus documented in a certain
    format. Documentation or corroboration of data helps in formulating statistical
    analysis and developing the decision support systems. Remote sensing charts and
    other crop assessing tools can be employed to understand the total crop yield
    of a particular region. Crop management can also be optimized using corroborating
    data. A yearly or term analysis can be performed on this data to improve precision
    farming. Food chain supply management can use the predictive analysis of this
    data for optimizing and designing new efficient strategies. The major areas where
    its application is seen are yield mapping for fertilization planning, field planning,
    agro-food traceability, site-specific measurements based on soil and water analysis,
    and remote vehicle monitoring for supply chains, etc. 3) Foretelling Also called
    forecasting is one of the major attributes or applications for decision making
    that is brought in agriculture with the introduction of IoT. With the IoT devices
    and network, real-time data analysis along with the comparison to the previously
    available datasets helps in the forecasting of the upcoming events in much advance.
    With this foretelling, various decision support systems can be designed capable
    of taking optimal and real time-decisions. It can also act as a preventive measure
    mechanism for avoiding or dealing with various upcoming unprecedented situations.
    With monitoring, data collection, and corroboration, foretelling can help in early
    disease detection, pest growth, weeding, drought, smart irrigation, and harvesting.
    Artificial intelligence can be employed for designing these learning systems.
    With IoT, a predictive analysis could be made way earlier than the harvest period
    for assessing crop production and consumption. Pre and post-harvest crop monitoring
    along with behavioral sciences and market analysis can also be employed to help
    site-specific farming and production increase in precision agriculture in the
    context of IoT. 4) Governing and Management It is an outcome of the monitoring
    device. Governing helps in controlling the whole system. Foretelling also plays
    a major role in governing. With IoT, it is important to govern the farm. Thresholds
    play a major role in designing a controlling strategy. Controlling is a major
    addendum of IoT in agriculture. Applications of controlling can be easily seen
    in site-specific management, working of smart irrigation models, plant growth
    monitoring models, and early crop analysis models and also in supply chain and
    smart vehicular navigation, interaction, optimization, and logistics control of
    farms. With governing, all the new strategies, formulae, practices and methods
    employed to solve the problems occurring on daily basis in farms can be monitored.
    These strategies can then be compared and analysed with the previous existential
    strategies. Therefore a knowledge base can be maintained. From the data analysis
    of that knowledge base, the best or the optimal strategies that can be employed
    to design or mould the system can be fetched. Various case studies can be performed
    to gather and test such information. From this the redundant techniques can be
    withdrawn and robust ones can be prioritised. With these methodologies and experiments,
    the management can be made more flexible, scalable and reliable. Also governing
    and management can be employed to find the best suited solutions. Due to the growth
    in agriculture sector, various public and private sector projects and startups
    are being started in various countries across the world. All these projects use
    artificial intelligence and IoT concepts to provide support and solutions to the
    growing industry of agriculture. All these projects or startups are explained
    in the TABLE 13. TABLE 13 IoT Based Public and Private Sector Projects/Startups
    for Precision Agriculture E. Our Proposed Work Inspired by the contribution of
    IoT in the field of agriculture, we proposed an architecture for precision farming.
    The layout of the architecture to be designed is proposed and shown in Fig. 8.
    The structure proposed for precision farming in case of farm management will constitute
    of different layers. The first layer would be the sensing layer, in which different
    types of sensors like soil, humidity, water, light, proximity, and conductive
    sensors will be deployed in the region of experimentation. All data from the sensors
    will be sent to the base station. The second layer is the network layer, which
    consists of gateways, internet, and other devices. This layer manages the traffic
    of the whole architecture. This layer collects data from the sensing layer and
    transfers it to the decision layer and the application layer. The third layer
    is the decision layer, which processes the data, manipulates it, and generates
    alerts or actions. The next layer is the application layer, which constitutes
    the firmware and the users. It receives all the inputs from other layers and the
    outputs are made visible to users. It also manages how the whole architecture
    will work or look. FIGURE 8. Proposed layered architecture for Precision Agriculture.
    Show All Our proposed architecture aims to observe and monitor the farm in real-time.
    Optimize the resource utilization, early detection of the diseases, and identification
    of the plant species, optimize irrigation facilities, and make definite use of
    pesticides and other manures. Monitor the growth of plants in each stage and take
    the necessary actions for the betterment of plants. The model to be designed will
    take into consideration the earning and investment of the small scale farmer.
    A scalable and cost efficient model will be designed by considering the reusability
    and recycling of the materials used. From the literature, it is found that the
    issue of interoperability and robustness is still not achieved. So, while designing
    the model these issues will be prioritized. Also, power supply and power consumption
    is a bottleneck for each model. So, from the literature it is found that energy
    harnessing approaches can be used to address this issue. In the proposed model,
    main focus will be on incorporating the concepts of energy harnessing approaches
    like solar energy and wind flow energy for power optimization. Harnessing solar
    energy for regions which have different season’s e.g., Kashmir, which has four
    seasons like spring, summer, autumn and winter throughout the year. So for these
    regions depending only on solar energy will be a bottle neck. Therefore, in the
    proposed work, a hybrid approach based on consumption of both wind and solar energy
    for reducing power consumption will be proposed. Some of the major findings of
    the proposed work will be: A scalable and cost efficient model will be designed
    by considering the reusability and recycling of materials used. The issues of
    interoperability and robustness issues of heterogeneous devices will be targeted.
    Power supply and power consumption being the bottleneck of each model will be
    targeted. To tackle such issues, energy conservation and energy harnessing approaches
    like solar and wind energy will be used. Harnessing solar energy for regions which
    have different season’s e.g., Kashmir, which has four seasons like spring, summer,
    autumn and winter throughout the year. So for these regions depending only on
    solar energy will be a bottle neck. Therefore in the proposed work, a hybrid approach
    based on consumption of both wind and solar energy for reducing power consumption
    will be proposed. Small scale farmers will be targeted for the development of
    sustainable and robust model. SECTION VI. Conclusion The Internet is revolutionizing
    our world. Communication via connective devices has become the countenance of
    survival. Agriculture is growing from precision farming to micro-farming. IoT
    has added more potential to communication by enabling the communication between
    humans and objects along with the environmental aspects. Seeking the vision of
    omnipresence i.e., anytime, anything, anywhere, everywhere, IoT should be considered
    a core for the development of new architectural concepts. Resource scarcity is
    a must address issue in precision agriculture and models should be developed to
    optimize resource utilization. Inclusion of monitoring in food supply chains,
    farms, greenhouses equipped with tags, WSN, etc. at each stage in the growth of
    the product/plant, making automatic reasoning via intelligent analysis and responses
    is moving towards much safer, secure, and trustworthy systems. In the article,

    Abstract: Internet of Things (IoT) as refers to a network of devices that have\
    \ the ability to connect,\ncollect and exchange data with other devices over the\
    \ Internet. IoT is a revolutionary technology\nthat have tremendous applications\
    \ in numerous ﬁelds of engineering and sciences such as logistics,\nhealthcare,\
    \ trafﬁc, oil and gas industries and agriculture. In agriculture ﬁeld, the farmer\
    \ still used\nconventional agriculture methods resulting in low crop and fruit\
    \ yields. The integration of IoT in\nconventional agriculture methods has led\
    \ to signiﬁcant developments in agriculture ﬁeld. Different\nsensors and IoT devices\
    \ are providing services to automate agriculture precision and to monitor crop\n\
    conditions. These IoT devices are deployed in agriculture environment to increase\
    \ yields production\nby making smart farming decisions and to collect data regarding\
    \ crops temperature, humidity\nand irrigation systems. However, the integration\
    \ of IoT and smart communication technologies in\nagriculture environment introduces\
    \ cyber security attacks and vulnerabilities. Such cyber attacks\nhave the capability\
    \ to adversely affect the countries’ economies that are heavily reliant on agriculture.\n\
    On the other hand, these IoT devices are resource constrained having limited memory\
    \ and power\ncapabilities and cannot be secured using conventional cyber security\
    \ protocols. Therefore, designing\nrobust and efﬁcient secure framework for smart\
    \ agriculture are required. In this paper, a Cyber\nSecured Framework for Smart\
    \ Agriculture (CSFSA) is proposed. The proposed CSFSA presents a\nrobust and tamper\
    \ resistant authentication scheme for IoT devices using Constrained Application\n\
    Protocol (CoAP) to ensure the data integrity and authenticity. The proposed CSFSA\
    \ is demonstrated\nin Contiki NG simulation tool and greatly reduces packet size,\
    \ communication overhead and power\nconsumption. The performance of proposed CSFSA\
    \ is computationally efﬁcient and is resilient against\nvarious cyber security\
    \ attacks i.e., replay attacks, Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, resource exhaustion.\n\
    Keywords: Internet of Things; authentication; security; agriculture\n1. Introduction\n\
    With the recent advancements in communication and physical sciences, it is now\n\
    possible to connect physical objects to the Internet from any place any time for\
    \ anything\nwithout human intervention by making everything smart. This advancement\
    \ is referred to\nas the Internet of Things (IoT) [1]. One of this century’s key\
    \ technological development\nhas been the IoT, which is still in its fancy stages.\
    \ In the coming years, this development is\nexpected to hit a big ﬁgure. By the\
    \ end of 2024, 62 billion IoT devices are expected to exist [2].\nAccording to\
    \ Statista report, it is predicted that this number will rise to 75.4 billion\
    \ by 2025.\nThe signiﬁcance of the IoT system has been acknowledged by major international\
    \ standards\nbodies, thereby ensuring development towards the proper functionality,\
    \ ﬂexibility and\nElectronics 2022, 11, 963. https://doi.org/10.3390/electronics11060963\n\

    compatibility of this system. Due to which IoT is making an impact in the majority\n\
    of the ﬁelds i.e., healthcare, trafﬁc, logistics, oil and gas industries and agriculture\
    \ [3].\nThe IoT enables devices with a variety of features and capabilities to\
    \ connect to the Internet.\nThe rapid rise of IoT applications results to a tremendous\
    \ increase in the number of IoT\ndevices connected to the worldwide network as\
    \ well as network trafﬁc over conventional\nnetwork. Due to its constrained nature,\
    \ the IoT growth adds more security challenges to the\nconventional network, as\
    \ the conventional communication network already faces various\nsecurity challenges.\
    \ Different IoT devices are not constructed to the necessary security\nrequirements,\
    \ resulting in huge security breaches [4].\nFood consciousness has grown amongst\
    \ the people lately with the exponential increase\nof the food industries and\
    \ radical improvements in individuals’ dietary behaviors and\nways of life [5].\
    \ People nowadays are more worried about the quality and safety of the food\n\
    they consume. Food safety is perceived to include food that is liberated from\
    \ contaminants\nand chemicals that may cause the development of microscopic organisms\
    \ destructive to\nindividuals’ safety and lives [6]. Agriculture systems has a\
    \ signiﬁcant impact on a country’s\neconomic growth as it is the main source of\
    \ food. According to report published by the\nUnited Nations’ Food and Agriculture\
    \ Organization [7], a signiﬁcant portion of food waste\nhappens due to various\
    \ variables during the pre-harvesting, harvest and even post-harvest\nstages and\
    \ as well the extent of its inﬂuence on the economy, environment, health and\n\
    survival of human race. According to a UN report, the world population is estimated\
    \ to\nsurpass 9 billion humans being by the end of 2050, an increase of about\
    \ a third over the\ncurrent population [8]. More than half of this increase will\
    \ occur in Pakistan, Nigeria, India,\nIndonesia, Ethiopia, the United Republic\
    \ of Tanzania, Egypt, and the United States. Such\nrise in population necessitates\
    \ a nearly 70 percent increase in food production rate. This\nfast growing population\
    \ brings with it a slew of additional challenges, including increased\ncompetition\
    \ and overuse of land, water and also other natural resources. These challenges\n\
    highlight critical need to minimize food system’s reliance on our environment.\
    \ As a\nresult, in order to meet the expanding need for food and crop production,\
    \ an evolutionary\nagricultural paradigm is required to ensure long-term development.\
    \ In an agricultural\nﬁeld, a smart sensing system is necessary to integrate the\
    \ status of the ﬁeld, its inﬂuence\non ﬁeld productivity, and to determine the\
    \ actions that must be taken on the ﬁeld for a\ngood outcome of a good produce.\
    \ A smart sensing environment is made up of a system\nof connected devices that\
    \ can constantly send and receive data from one another. It can\nalso make decisions\
    \ on behalf of a user and take action to enhance the environment [9].\nThis shift\
    \ in the environment necessitates more constant monitoring of the surroundings,\n\
    resulting in an ever-changing environment.\nAgriculture plays an important role\
    \ in country’s economic growth and it is the basis\nfor human species. Conventional\
    \ agricultural methods are still being used by farmers,\nresulting in low crop\
    \ and fruit yields. As a result, integrating IoT technologies can boost\ncrop\
    \ productivity. IoT is an essential part of the smart agriculture architecture.\
    \ With the\nintegration of IoT devices, the agriculture systems have been monitored\
    \ 24/7. These IoT\ndevices sense the surrounding environment and physical parameters\
    \ to take sensed infor-\nmation. Such sensed information is then sent to the backend\
    \ server via Internet or through\nsensor gateway, where date is stored for future\
    \ use or even user can view that sensed data.\nThe user can make decisions about\
    \ what actions to do in such a monitored environment.\nHowever, it’s not an easy\
    \ task to integrate everyday devices with the Internet. Security\nis a big challenge\
    \ faced by IoT, although each device has its unique set of characteristics\nand\
    \ requirements. First of all, each person, device and system which is connected\
    \ to the\nInternet must be identiﬁed. Intruders will acquire access to the network\
    \ and perform\nsecurity breaches if they do not have a valid identity.\nIn case\
    \ of smart agriculture systems, if information of sensors monitoring the agricul-\n\
    ture parameters is leaked, lost or tampered with, it can render the products useless\
    \ and\ndamage their value signiﬁcantly hence resulting in huge economic food loss.\
    \ Therefore,\ndeveloping a concrete framework for secure monitoring of smart agriculture\
    \ with the adap-\nElectronics 2022, 11, 963\n3 of 19\ntion of IoT devices is an\
    \ essential requirement of this era. Since IoT devices are designed to\nbe compact\
    \ and cost effective, because they have limited computing power and memory.\n\
    Their resource constrained nature makes it difﬁcult to secure them and has necessitated\n\
    the development of lightweight application protocols and security suites. Instead\
    \ of using\nstandard TCP/IP protocols i.e., Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP)\
    \ and Transport Layer\nSecurity (TLS), these devices use the IoT protocol stack,\
    \ which is a lightweight version of\nthe TCP/IP model specially designed for IoT\
    \ devices. The CoAP has been standardized as\nlightweight application protocol\
    \ for IoT systems. However, developing a low-overhead\nsecurity solution for CoAP\
    \ remains a challenge. Though some security protocols i.e., stan-\ndard Datagram\
    \ Transport Layer Security protocol (DTLS) exists. However, it is not suitable\n\
    for IoT constrained devices and is expensive due to its computational overhead,\
    \ complexity\nand lengthy cipher suites process. Therefore, this paper proposed\
    \ a robust and lightweight\nsecure authentication framework in CoAP using symmetric\
    \ encryption i.e., Advanced\nEncryption System (AES) and HMAC-SHA-224. The main\
    \ contribution of this paper is\nto design robust and tamper-resistant secure\
    \ authentication framework for agriculture\napplication using CoAP by ensuring\
    \ data integrity and authenticity. The proposed CSFSA\nis implemented in Contiki\
    \ NG and Cooja simulator and evaluated performances in terms\nof packet size,\
    \ communication overhead and power consumption. The signiﬁcance of\nproposed CSFSA\
    \ is to make resilient against various cyber security attacks i.e., replay\nattacks,\
    \ Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, resource exhaustion.\nThe proposed CSFSA provides\
    \ secure monitoring of various agriculture parameters\nremotely. The architecture\
    \ of proposed CSFSA has three modules i.e., 6LoWPAN based\ninternal network having\
    \ IoT devices deployed in agriculture ﬁeld for monitoring and\ncontrolling, a\
    \ border router which acts as bridge between Internal network and external\nnetwork\
    \ i.e., Internet and a web server that provides access to the sensed data as shown\
    \ in\nFigure 1.\nThe paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides brief\
    \ explanation of literature\nreview that has been done in smart agriculture, IoT\
    \ and CoAP security. Section 3 provides\nan in-depth overview of standards and\
    \ protocols pertinent to our research work. Proposed\nmethodology is presented\
    \ in Section 4. Simulation and results evaluation is discussed in\nSection 5.\
    \ Finally, concluding remarks are given in Section 6.\nFigure 1. CSFSA architecture.\n\
    2. Related Work\nThis section provides the related literature that has been done\
    \ in the ﬁeld of CoAP\nsecurity, IoT security, various authentication techniques\
    \ used between IoT devices and\nagriculture sector.\nThe Hyper Text Transfer Protocol\
    \ (HTTP) is an application layer protocol used by the\nWorld Wide Web to access\
    \ data on Internet and uses the Representational State Transfer\n(REST) architecture.\
    \ The HTTP request and response messages exchange data between\nHTTP server and\
    \ client [10]. This protocol is not suitable for IoT and cannot be implemented\n\
    Electronics 2022, 11, 963\n4 of 19\non IoT devices due to computational overhead.\
    \ As a result, a lightweight and efﬁcient\nprotocol for constrained devices is\
    \ required. The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)\nConstrained RESTful Environment\
    \ (CoRE) working group has standardized lightweight\napplication protocol for\
    \ IoT systems i.e., CoAP. It is a specialized web transfer protocol,\nspecially\
    \ designed for resource constrained applications. In [11], the authors compared\
    \ the\nCoAP and HTTP protocol and evaluated their performances based on energy\
    \ consumption,\nbattery life and amount of bytes exchanged per session as shown\
    \ in Table 1.\nTable 1. HTTP and CoAP comparison based on resource consumption.\n\

    CoAP\n154\n0.744 mW\n151 days\nTransport Layer Security (TLS) is used for securing\
    \ HTTP communication over Trans-\nmission Control Protocol (TCP). The CoAP communication\
    \ over User Datagram Protocol\n(UDP) is secured by using DTLS. However standard\
    \ DTLS is not suitable for constrained\nnetworks due to its computational overhead,\
    \ complexity and handshake session overhead.\nIn [12], the authors provided brief\
    \ overview of layered architecture of IoT and security\nvulnerabilities at each\
    \ layer. They discussed in details various communication technologies\nalong with\
    \ their features and limitations which are being used by IoT applications. They\n\
    also reviewed the existing security mechanisms with their limitations to secure\
    \ the IoT envi-\nronment. In [13], the authors presented two-way authentication\
    \ scheme based on DTLS and\nRSA cryptographic algorithm. DTLS protocol is implemented\
    \ in context of system architec-\nture to achieve low overhead and high interoperability.\
    \ However, due to the deployment of\nRSA encryption, the computational overhead\
    \ required by their handshake process requires\nmore energy. Shahid et al. [14]\
    \ presented lightweight secure CoAP i.e., Lithe for securing\nIoT devices communication.\
    \ This work provided secure framework by integrating CoAP\nand DTLS. The standard\
    \ DTLS is not suitable for constrained devices. The proposed scheme\nused the\
    \ DTLS header compression by leveraging 6LoWPAN standard and signiﬁcantly\nreduced\
    \ the energy consumption. The results showed that compressed DTLS performs\nbetter\
    \ in terms of energy efﬁciency, network response time, packet size and processing\
    \ time.\nIn [15], the proposed framework enables the communication between android\
    \ phones\nusing DTLS secured CoAP. This framework combines other algorithms with\
    \ DTLS that are\nnot applicable on resource constrained IoT devices. DTLS requires\
    \ public key cryptography\nwhich is a computationally expensive process and a\
    \ lengthy handshake process [16]. Al-\nthough there are certain security algorithms\
    \ which are lightweight and have less overhead\nsuch as raw public key, at least\
    \ 25 bytes per-packet overhead of DTLS takes up one-third\nof a frame. DTLS heavily\
    \ hinders the performance in terms of round-trip messages when\nretroﬁtted to\
    \ CoAP [17].\nThe authors Raza et al. [18], present a scheme for making the implementation\
    \ secure\nCoAP lightweight by applying header compression techniques. Although\
    \ header com-\npression does not offer an improvement in performance because DTLS\
    \ is computationally\nintensive. The authors Freeman et al. [19] propose a plan\
    \ that enables the client to assign\na certiﬁcate path and construction as well\
    \ as the validation of the certiﬁcation path to a\nserver. However, this protocol\
    \ is expected to be used over HTTP. This protocol relies on\nthird-party instead\
    \ of communication parties and adds a heavy communication overhead.\nIn [13],\
    \ a framework for the end-to-end security of IoT has been presented. The authors\n\
    have used DTLS in combination with other standard protocols such as RSA. The use\
    \ of RSA\nadds a high computational complexity and overhead to the network. In\
    \ addition to that,\nthe authentication handshake process in DTLS in which the\
    \ client and server authenticate\neach other takes in excess of three round trips.\
    \ Authors of [20] have suggested a technique\nfor lightweight authentication using\
    \ Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). In this tech-\nElectronics 2022, 11, 963\n\
    5 of 19\nnique, the client and server ensure the identity of the devices based\
    \ on the message payload.\nDuring this process, a total of four messages are exchanged\
    \ between the client and server.\nIn [21] Park et al. have presented an implementation\
    \ of an architecture that uses a\ndelegation method to send and receive messages.\
    \ In this implementation, a Secure Service\nManager (SSM) is used in the handshake\
    \ process. This system requires the SSM, sensors\nand trust manager to be located\
    \ in a constrained network. Hence it may not be suitable\nfor all kinds of IoT\
    \ setups. In [22], Granjal et al. propose a plan for end-to-end security by\n\
    using DTLS algorithm. This system uses the Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) to\
    \ encrypt\ndata in resource constrained nodes. Although ECC consumes less power\
    \ and memory\ncompared to other public key encryption algorithms, it still uses\
    \ up more resources than\nthe symmetric key encryption algorithms [23]. Using\
    \ complex cipher suites for encryption\nresults in high energy consumption. The\
    \ authors have used a symmetric key cryptography\nalgorithm, AES to replace DTLS\
    \ in the authentication process. AES performs a four-way\nhandshake between the\
    \ CoAP based server and CoAP client. This process adds two header\noptions in\
    \ the CoAP packet for enabling secure mode.\nIn [24], the authors present a scheme\
    \ for the authentication between client and server\nby modifying the header of\
    \ the CoAP packets. AES 128 is used for the encryption process\nand UDP protocol\
    \ is used without DTLS in the transport layer. This scheme reduces the\nnumber\
    \ of messages required for authentication between two parties without any loss\n\
    in the overall efﬁciency. In [25], the various advantages of the new features\
    \ of “Future\nInternet” are described, which greatly beneﬁts farm management techniques.\
    \ The “Future\nInternet” programme overcomes the limitations of the already existing\
    \ Internet. These\nbeneﬁts include generic software modules that can be modiﬁed\
    \ to build speciﬁc modules\nrelated to farming. The main architecture of the farm\
    \ management system is speciﬁed,\ndepending on which model is stored in the cloud.\n\
    Tanmay Baranwal et al. [26] the main focus of this paper is to protect and secure\n\
    agricultural goods from rodents and insects in storage units and ﬁelds. Real-time\
    \ security\nsystems are used, which provide notiﬁcations as soon as an issue is\
    \ identiﬁed. Python\nscripts are used to integrate the various electronic devices\
    \ and sensors. The algorithm of\nthis system is based on data collection to achieve\
    \ accuracy in alerting the user and starting\nthe repellent. The system is tested\
    \ in a 10 m², the device is ﬁxed in a corner during the\ntesting. As the PIR sensor\
    \ senses heat, it immediately starts the URD sensor and starts\nvideo recording\
    \ through a webcam. The accuracy achieved from these test cases reaches up\nto\
    \ 84.8%. It will be beneﬁcial to incorporate the security system in storage units\
    \ to prevent\nrodents from attacking the goods. LIU Dan et al. [27] this paper\
    \ emphasizes on the role of\ngreenhouse technology in the agricultural ﬁeld and\
    \ presents the design and development\nof an environment monitoring system. This\
    \ system makes use of ZigBee technology and\nCC2530 chip. Data collection, processing\
    \ and communication by the wireless sensors and\nnodes is done by using the CC2530F256\
    \ core. The proposed monitoring system gives real-\ntime information to the user\
    \ regarding different parameters such as temperature control\nand fan condition\
    \ etc. This system utilizes intelligent greenhouse monitoring and control\ntechniques\
    \ and helps the farmers to produce balanced and scientiﬁc crops.\nNikesh Gondchawar\
    \ et al. [28] proposes a smart agriculture system based on IoT and\nautomation\
    \ techniques. The proposed system uses a remotely controllable robot based on\n\
    GPS to execute tasks such as weeding, spraying pesticides and monitoring moisture\
    \ levels\netc. The proposed system also incorporates smart irrigation techniques\
    \ through intelligent\ndecision making based on real-time data from the ﬁelds.\
    \ In addition to that, it also includes\nsmart warehouse management modules. It\
    \ observes the temperature, humidity as well\nas theft detection in the warehouse.\
    \ The system architecture includes various sensors,\ncameras, ZigBee devices,\
    \ actuators with microcontrollers and Raspberry Pi. This system\nalerts the user\
    \ regarding irrigation and storage problems and uses a remotely controllable\n\
    robot for smart irrigation and warehouse management.\nAgostino Forestiero [29]\
    \ proposes an activity footprints based method to detect anoma-\nlies in IoT by\
    \ exploiting a multiagent algorithm. The method allows real-valued vectors to\n\
    Electronics 2022, 11, 963\n6 of 19\nbe used to map sequences of speciﬁc device\
    \ activity (digital footprints). The vectors are\ngiven to mobile agents, who\
    \ act according to a modiﬁed bio-inspired model for each of\nthem. On the basis\
    \ of simple local movement rules observed by all agents onto a virtual\n2D space,\
    \ this model allows intelligent global behaviour to evolve. In [30], the authors\n\
    proposes an agent-based algorithm for achieving a distributed resources organization\n\
    in an IoT environment. In order to map the IoT objects, a natural language processing\n\
    approach was used, which was able to capture the semantic context and represent\
    \ things\nwith high-dimensional vectors, allowing advanced agents to operate.\
    \ In a highly dynamic\nand, essentially, unstructured environment, the growing\
    \ organised virtual structure, i.e., a\nsimilarity-based overlay network of agents,\
    \ allows for the development of informed re-\nsource selection/discovery services,\
    \ making them more efﬁcient. The approach’s validity\nhas been conﬁrmed by preliminary\
    \ results.\nMarco Lombardi et al. [31] proposed a preliminary study case of a\
    \ probabilistic\napproach in an intrusion detection system over the CAN-bus to\
    \ guarantee cyber security\ninside connected vehicles. An innovative two-step\
    \ detection algorithm has been used to\nexploit both the variation of the status\
    \ parameters of the various ECUs over time and the\nBayesian networks which can\
    \ identify a possible attack. Starting from a domain analysis\nis possible to\
    \ ﬁnd out what are the parameters of interests and how these are related to\n\
    each other. Marco Lombardi et al. [3] provided brief overview of IoT regarding\
    \ current\narchitectures, technologies, protocols, and applications. They discussed\
    \ in details various\napplications which is based on IoT i.e., smart Cities, smart\
    \ roads, and smart industries.\nExiting security protocols i.e., standard Datagram\
    \ Transport Layer Security protocol\n(DTLS) is not suitable for IoT constrained\
    \ devices and is expensive due to its computational\noverhead, complexity and\
    \ lengthy cipher suites process. However, the DTLS protocol\nneeds to be modiﬁed\
    \ in such a way that it’s feasible for resource constrained devices.\nHence, researchers\
    \ are looking for alternative security frameworks to replace DTLS. In this\nresearch\
    \ work, we propose a lightweight and robust authentication framework for agri-\n\
    culture application and evaluate its performance to show that it is feasible for\
    \ constrained\nIoT devices.\n3. Background\nThis section provides an in-depth\
    \ description of IoT layered architecture, CoAP ar-\nchitecture, proposed framework\
    \ architecture, standard and protocols related to our re-\nsearch work.\n3.1.\
    \ Iot Protocol Stack Development\nThe IoT protocol stack is a critical component\
    \ of IoT technology because it allows\nhardware to communicate data in a structured\
    \ and useful way. In recent years, the IoT\nhas seen an uptick in a variety of\
    \ applications, such as smart homes, smart health, smart\nagriculture, and smart\
    \ logistics, where each application has its own properties and resource\nrequirements,\
    \ as well as its own protocols to match its objectives [32].\nIoT protocols are\
    \ classiﬁed based on the role they play in the network. Table 2\nshows the logical\
    \ layering of protocol hierarchies used in network communications nowa-\ndays.\
    \ The following is a comparison of the protocols for each layer in the protocol\
    \ stack\nto determine which one is best for the smart agriculture scenario in\
    \ terms of efﬁciency\nand productivity.\nTable 2. IoT Communication Protocols.\n\
    Application Layer\nCoAP, MQTT, MQTT-SN and XMPP\nNetwork Layer\n6LoWPAN, ZigBee\
    \ and BLE\nLink Layer\nIEEE 802.15.4, 802.11 a/b/g/n/ad/ac and 802.15.1\nElectronics\
    \ 2022, 11, 963\n7 of 19\n3.1.1. Application Layer Protocols Comparison\nCoAP,\
    \ MQTT, MQTT-SN, and XMPP are the most often used application layer pro-\ntocols\
    \ in IoT. The following paragraphs offer a comparative review to choose an ideal\n\
    application layer protocol for smart agriculture based on their advantages and\
    \ limitations.\nConstrained Application protocol (CoAP) is a web transfer protocol\
    \ that is designed\nto be a lightweight version of HTTP based on Representational\
    \ State Transfer (REST).\nCoAP runs over UDP, eliminating most of the TCP overhead\
    \ of HTTP, decreasing the\nbandwidth requirements, providing more simplicity,\
    \ and makes it more appropriate for\nsmart agriculture applications. CoAP is built\
    \ upon the request/response model and\nsupports methods such as GET, PUT, POST,\
    \ and DELETE as well as unicast and multicast\ntransmission. CoAP is efﬁcient\
    \ in terms of infrastructure, bandwidth and power usage [33].\nMessage Queuing\
    \ Telemetry Transport (MQTT) is another protocol designed for\nresource constraint\
    \ devices by IBM. It is based on an asynchronous publish/subscribe\nprotocol that\
    \ runs over TCP. The message pattern in MQTT includes a broker, publisher and\n\
    subscriber. The broker is tasked with controlling and distributing of data packets\
    \ between\nsubscribers and publishers. The addition of TCP makes it much more\
    \ reliable, however it\nadds more latency and causes a higher bandwidth and power\
    \ consumption. Hence, it is\nnot recommended for real time applications.\nMQTT-SN\
    \ is a modiﬁed version of MQTT, designed especially for sensor networks. It\n\
    uses UDP instead of TCP to minimize the drawbacks of MQTT but its core infrastructure\n\
    is the same as MQTT. The main difference between the two is that, MQTT-SN requires\n\
    a gateway to translate all MQTT-SN messages over UDP to MQTT messages over TCP.\n\
    Currently, this functionality is integrated within the brokers [34]. This extra\
    \ step for the\ninterpretation of messages, adds complexity to the overall framework\
    \ hence increases\npower consumption.\nThe Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol\
    \ (XMPP) is designed to allow short\nmessages and low latency, making it ideal\
    \ for IoT communications. The XMPP protocol may\nhandle both request/response\
    \ and publish/subscribe formats, which allow for bidirectional\nand multidirectional\
    \ communication, respectively. The decentralised nature of XMPP\nallows for high\
    \ scalability [35]. The XMPP protocol use XML for communication, which\nincreases\
    \ network trafﬁc. This results in high bandwidth use, high CPU usage, and no\n\
    guarantee of QoS.\nThe comparative analysis of various application layer protocols\
    \ show that CoAP gen-\nerates less overhead than the other protocols. In terms\
    \ of power consumption, bandwidth\nand infrastructure requirements and is most\
    \ suitable for the proposed CSFSA framework.\n3.1.2. Network Layer Protocols Comparison\n\
    Some of the most used network layer protocols used in IoT applications are IPv6\n\
    over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Network (6LoWPAN), ZigBee and Bluetooth\
    \ Low\nEnergy (BLE). A comparative review of these network layer protocol is given\
    \ as follows:\n6LoWPAN is based on IP version 6 (IPv6), it features 128-bit hexadecimal\
    \ addresses,\nand uses the 802.15.4 radio frequency. It enables the use of IP\
    \ in low-power and lossy\nwireless networks, such as WSNs (Wireless Sensor Networks),\
    \ IoT (Internet of Things) and\nM2M applications. One of the most unique characteristics\
    \ of 6LoWPAN is that it allows\nheader compression and encapsulation, making it\
    \ more lightweight and secure than ZigBee.\nThe most notable advantage of 6LoWPAN\
    \ is that it supports IP networks natively [36].\nThe ZigBee protocol is based\
    \ on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard, which allows for less\nbattery consumption in\
    \ IoT networks by keeping nodes in low power mode for the most\npart. However,\
    \ unlike 6LoWPAN, which has interoperability, ZigBee cannot readily com-\nmunicate\
    \ with other protocols.\nBluetooth 5 is the latest version of BLE. It supports\
    \ IP networks however, BLE is unable\nto establish a self-healing mesh network,\
    \ which is becoming particularly crucial for IoT\napplications. An additional\
    \ gateway is required to communicate with the internet when\nutilizing ZigBee\
    \ or classic Bluetooth, which adds extra overhead.\nElectronics 2022, 11, 963\n\
    8 of 19\nIt can be deduced from the above discussion that due to its compression\
    \ and encap-\nsulation capabilities, interoperability and low network overhead,\
    \ 6LoWPAN is the prime\noption for the proposed CSFSA framework.\n3.1.3. Link\
    \ Layer Protocols Comparison\nThere are three main link layer protocols present\
    \ for IoT applications, IEEE 802.15.4\nfor 6LoWPAN and ZigBee, IEEE 802.11 for\
    \ Wi-Fi. and IEEE 802.15.1 for Bluetooth. A brief\nanalysis of the above mentioned\
    \ protocols is given below:\nIEEE 802.15.4 is a low-power wireless network standard\
    \ developed by the Institute\nof Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).\
    \ It has a communication range of at least\n10 metres and up to 100 metres. The\
    \ 802.15.4 category is the dominant standard for low\ndata-rate and security in\
    \ Wireless Personal Area Networks (WPAN).\nIEEE standards for wireless communications\
    \ WLANs/Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi) are\n802.11 networks with communication ranges\
    \ varying from 40 to 90 metres. Wi-Fi (IEEE\n802.11) is inefﬁcient in terms of\
    \ battery life, does not cover a vast area, and does not support\na large number\
    \ of end devices.\nBluetooth, i.e., 802.15.1, is another WPANs standard speciﬁed\
    \ by the 802.15 group,\nwith a communication range of 10 metres to 50 metres.\
    \ It is more power efﬁcient but less\nencrypted compared to Wi-Fi [37].\nFrom\
    \ the comparison it is determined that IEEE 802.15.4 is the best ﬁt for the proposed\n\
    CSFSA framework because it is compatible with 6LoWPAN, provides more security,\
    \ con-\nsumes less power and has a higher communication range compared to the\
    \ other protocols.\nBased on the comparison of several protocols at different\
    \ layers, the IoT protocol stack\nfor proposed CSFSA framework is presented in\
    \ Figure 2.\nFigure 2. IoT protocol stack for CSFSA.\n3.2. Coap Architecture\n\
    The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is a specialized web transfer protocol,\n\
    specially designed for constrained applications. The CoAP’s interactive client/server\
    \ model\nis similar to HTTP model. It has similar features and principles as in\
    \ HTTP. Due to higher\ncommunication overhead of HTTP and HTTPS, such protocols\
    \ are not suitable for IoT\ncommunication. Therefore, CoAP is designed to interface\
    \ with HTTP, to easily integrate\nwith existing web-browsers, while ensuring constrained\
    \ networks and M2M [38,39] special-\nized requirements i.e., multicast support,\
    \ simplicity, and low message overhead. The IETF\nElectronics 2022, 11, 963\n\
    9 of 19\nConstrained RESTful Environment (CoRE) working group standardized CoAP\
    \ protocol.\nIt is designed according to the Representational State Transfer (REST)\
    \ architecture. CoAP\nsupported multicast requests, asynchronous communication,\
    \ content type and congestion\ncontrol, cashing and proxy abilities. The CoAP\
    \ packet format has a 4 bytes ﬁxed size header\nas shown in Figure 3.\nFigure\
    \ 3. CoAP packet format.\nThe CoAP architecture has message layer and request/response\
    \ layer as shown in\nFigure 4. The message layer handles the message exchange\
    \ over UDP between end points.\nIt deals with reliability and asynchronous mechanism.\
    \ While request/response layer deals\nwith request and response messages and their\
    \ mapping. CoAP has four types of messages\ni.e., Conﬁrmable (requires an acknowledgement),\
    \ Non-Conﬁrmable (needed no acknowl-\nedgement), Acknowledgement (receipt of conﬁrmable\
    \ message), Reset (conﬁrmable or\nnon-conﬁrmable message not processed properly),\
    \ Piggy-backed (sends Acknowledge-\nment with conﬁrmable message). The CoAP used\
    \ same methods i.e., GET, POST, PUT,\nDELETE for generating, restoring, creating\
    \ or updating and deleting processes as like HTTP.\nThe CoAP protocol lacks trusted\
    \ standards for secure architecture and its messages are\nencrypted by using DTLS,\
    \ which was not designed for resource constrained devices and\nhence is not suited\

    \ Authentication Framework\nIn most of the IoT applications, CoAP is utilized\
    \ as an application layer protocol.\nCoAP does not provide any security for data\
    \ transmission between two constrained nodes.\nThe CoAP server and client communication\
    \ can be secured with DTLS, however, as men-\ntioned in the preceding section,\
    \ DTLS is not suitable for IoT constrained devices and\nit causes computational\
    \ overhead and complexity on constrained nodes. Therefore, ro-\nElectronics 2022,\
    \ 11, 963\n10 of 19\nbust and tamper-resistant authentication framework between\
    \ CoAP server and client is\nproposed to ensure data integrity and authenticity.\
    \ The proposed CSFSA framework is\ncomputationally efﬁcient and is resilient against\
    \ various cyber security attacks i.e., replay\nattacks, DoS attacks and resource\
    \ exhaustion. It avoids the need to develop the additional\nsecurity protocol.\n\
    Like HTTP, CoAP is based on client/server model architecture to establish connection\n\
    when client sends request to server and server sends response to the client. For\
    \ observation\nof resources, all the server and clients used the CoAP protocol.\
    \ In order to observe resource,\nthe server ﬁrst authenticates the client identity.\
    \ If the client is authentic, the server will\nestablish session with that client\
    \ and will respond to the client. On the client side while\nreceiving response\
    \ message from server, the client checks the server authenticity. Once\nboth client\
    \ and server are authenticated, they proceed and exchange data between them.\n\
    The proposed CSFSA framework uses the AES encryption techniques and hash based\n\
    message authentication code algorithm HMAC-SHA-224 by ensuring message integrity\n\
    and authenticity. Before starting communication, the CoAP client and server ﬁrst\
    \ agree\non sequence ID and pre-shared secret key Kpre. The server stores each\
    \ device sequence\nID and Kpre in its own repository for device identiﬁcation\
    \ and to fetch associated Kpre for\nthat device. Now whenever client wants to\
    \ start communication with server, it will send\nrequest to server, after receiving\
    \ request from server, server will check client authenticity\nﬁrst. Figure 5 shows\
    \ the proposed CSFSA authentication architecture. On the client side,\nthe server\
    \ veriﬁes and authenticate the client identity. The client ﬁrst generates timestamp\n\
    T1 in order to prevent from replay attacks and calculates hash value of Kpre and\
    \ T1 using\nHMAC-SHA-224 hash algorithm. This hash value is then concatenated\
    \ with the device\nsequence ID and T1 as follow:\nHC = HMAC (Kpre, T1)\n(1)\n\
    CMP = ID ||T1|| HC\n(2)\nwhere CMP is the client message payload. The client then\
    \ sends its ﬁnal message CMP to\nthe server.\nOn the server side, while receiving\
    \ message from client, the server checks client\nmessage authenticity. The server\
    \ ﬁrst checks the sequence ID in its repository, if it’s not\npresent in repository,\
    \ the connection will be then rejected, otherwise server will fetch\nassociated\
    \ Kpre for that device in its repository. The server then generates its own hash\n\
    value of Kpre and T1 as follow:\nHS = HMAC (Kpre, T1)\n(3)\nwhere HS is the server\
    \ hash value. The server compares its own generated hash value HS\nwith the received\
    \ hash value HC from the client. If both hash values are not same, the server\n\
    then rejects the client request. If both values are same, then the server authenticates\
    \ client\nfor services. Once client is authenticated by server, the server creates\
    \ reply message for the\nmessage received from authentic client. Therefore, the\
    \ server generates timestamp T2 and\nsession key KS. The server encrypts KS and\
    \ T2 using Kpre and AES encryption algorithm\nand calculate the hash value of\
    \ Kpre and T2 using HMAC-SHA-224 hash algorithm as\nfollows:\nEM = EKpre (KS,\
    \ T2)\n(4)\nH′S = HMAC (Kpre, T2)\n(5)\nThe server sends H’S along with encrypted\
    \ message EM and T2 to the client. Upon\nreceiving message from server, the client\
    \ generates the hash value HMAC (Kpre, T2) and\ncompares both own generated hash\
    \ value and received hash value. If both hash values are\nnot same, the client\
    \ terminates the connection. If both are same, the server is authenticated\nElectronics\
    \ 2022, 11, 963\n11 of 19\nand the client then decrypts the received encrypted\
    \ message EM using Kpre and AES\nencryption algorithm to obtain session key KS.\n\
    H′C = HMAC (Kpre, T2)\n(6)\nDM = DKpre (EM)\n(7)\nIn this way, the sensitive agriculture\
    \ data is being encrypted and decrypted between\nthe server and client with the\
    \ help of using this session key KS.\nFigure 5. Proposed CSFSA authentication\
    \ framework.\n4. Methodology\nThis research work aims to develop robust and tamper-resistant\
    \ authentication frame-\nwork for monitoring and controlling of IoT devices in\
    \ smart agriculture. The architecture of\nproposed CSFSA consists of three modules\
    \ such as internal network i.e., 6LoWPAN based\nIoT network, external network\
    \ and gateway which acts as bridge between internal and ex-\nternal network. The\
    \ complete proposed CSFSA is developed and emulated in Contiki-NG\noperating system\
    \ and Cooja simulator. Various steps of methodology are brieﬂy explained\nin the\
    \ following subsections.\n4.1. Description of Proposed CSFSA Framework\nThis is\
    \ the ﬁrst phase where we will deﬁne and explain the structure of proposed\nCSFSA.\
    \ The proposed CSFSA consists of personal computer where VMWare is installed.\n\
    On VMWare, Ubuntu is installed for Contiki-NG operating system where Cooja simulator\n\
    and Wireshark is used for framework development and analysis of result. Cooja\
    \ is a useful\nsimulator for Contiki-NG development, as it provides simulation\
    \ environment by allowing\ndevelopers to simulate and test code/system before\
    \ running it on the actual hardware.\nThe proposed framework has three modules\
    \ i.e., 6LoWPAN based internal network having\nIoT devices deployed in agriculture\
    \ ﬁeld for monitoring and controlling, a gateway which\nacts as bridge between\
    \ IoT and external network i.e., Internet and a web server.\n4.2. Design and Development\
    \ of Proposed CSFSA Framework\nThis is the second phase which is based on design\
    \ and development. The compre-\nhensive activity diagram for CSFSA is as shown\
    \ in Figure 6. First step is to open Cooja\nsimulation, then radio propagation\
    \ model is selected i.e., Unit Disk Graph Medium-distance\nloss (UDGM-Distance\
    \ Loss). The Unit Disk Graph Radio Medium abstracts radio transmis-\nsion range\
    \ as circles. Two different range parameters are used i.e., one for transmission\
    \ and\none for interfering with other radios and transmission.\nElectronics 2022,\
    \ 11, 963\n12 of 19\nFigure 6. Activity diagram for design and development.\n\
    The next step is the selection of mote i.e., sky mote is selected having 10 KB\
    \ of RAM.\nOn one sky mote, CoAP server is compiled for communication within agriculture\
    \ ﬁeld\n(internal network) and is secured by deploying proposed CSFSA. While Routing\
    \ Protocol\nfor Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) border router is compiled on\
    \ another sky mote\nfor connectivity with external network. The next step is to\
    \ create bridge between border\nrouter and external network. To enable that bridge,\
    \ need to open serial socket server on\nthe border router through “Listening on\
    \ port 60001”. In this way, RPL network is created.\nNow to connect this RPL network\
    \ to the external network, tunslip utility is used which is\nprovided in Contiki-NG.\
    \ Tunslip creates a bridge between RPL network and local machine\ni.e., 127.0.0.1\
    \ as shown in Figure 7.\nFigure 7. Tunslip connectivity.\nTo initiate border router\
    \ connection, open a new terminal in Contiki and type the\nfollowing commands\
    \ (shown in Figure 8):\ncd Contiki/examples/ipv6/rpl-border-router/\nmake connect-router-cooja\n\
    Electronics 2022, 11, 963\n13 of 19\nFigure 8. Border router connectivity with\
    \ external network.\nFinally, Copper (Cu) based CoAP user agent is installed for\
    \ communication with web\nserver which is then opened in browser for control and\
    \ monitoring of IoT devices in smart\nagriculture. The Copper CoAP user agent\
    \ is an add-on for the Firefox web browser, used\nfor browsing and direct interaction\
    \ with CoAP resources.\n4.3. Operation and Procedure of Proposed CSFSA framework\n\
    In this phase, the operation of proposed CSFSA is presented in 3 primary modules\
    \ such\nas the internal network i.e., IoT devices, border router and external\
    \ network i.e., internet as\nillustrated in Figure 9. The framework’s procedure\
    \ and operation ratify the proposed IoT\nprotocol stack which includes IoT devices\
    \ that use CoAP at the application layer, a border\nrouter that uses 6LoWPAN at\
    \ the network layer and IEEE 802.15.4 radio at the link layer and\na web server\
    \ that uses a Copper-based CoAP client. The RPL border router acts as bridge\n\
    that connects external network with 6LoWPAN based internal network. The proposed\n\
    framework connects CoAP based IoT devices to the internet via 6LoWPAN border router\n\
    Figure 9. Operation of proposed CSFSA.\n5. Results Evaluation and Discussion\n\
    To appraise the performance of proposed CSFSA, the CSFSA is emulated in Contiki\n\
    NG operating system and Cooja simulator. Contiki NG is an open source operating\
    \ system\nElectronics 2022, 11, 963\n14 of 19\nwhich is designed especially for\
    \ memory constrained systems. Cooja is an open source\nsimulator which is used\
    \ for the development of Contiki NG, as it provides simulation\nenvironment by\
    \ allowing developers to simulate and test code/system before running it\non the\
    \ actual hardware.\n5.1. Simulation Parameters\nThe simulation parameters used\
    \ for the implementation of CSFSA is shown in Table 3.\nThe mote chosen for simulation\
    \ is Wismote which is MSP430 microcontroller based board\nhaving 16 KB of RAM\
    \ and 256 KB of ﬂash memory and a radio chip CC2420 compatible with\nIEEE 802.15.4\
    \ standard. The protocols used in the simulation are CoAP as an application\n\
    layer protocol, UDP as transport layer protocol, 6LoWPAN as network layer protocol\
    \ and\nIEEE 802.15.4 as link layer protocol.\nTable 3. Simulation parameters.\n\

    \ performance, it is divided into two simulation\nscenarios i.e., CoAP with proposed\
    \ CSFSA and CoAP-DTLS implementation scenarios.\nCoAP with proposed CSFSA scenario\
    \ comprised of 5 motes and 1 border router. Here\nmotes are CoAP servers which\
    \ are developed on proposed IoT protocol stack and deployed\nin agriculture ﬁeld\
    \ for control and monitoring of various agriculture parameters. The mote\n1 is\
    \ the border router while motes 2–6 running CoAP servers and all the motes are\
    \ placed\nin the transmission range of border router. The border router is used\
    \ for connectivity\nwith external network (internet) through tunslip utility.\
    \ The purpose of CoAP servers are\nmonitoring and controlling of environmental\
    \ conditions of agriculture ﬁeld and send it\nto remote server i.e., CoAP client\
    \ application. The CoAP client is Cupper based browser\nwhich is used for browsing\
    \ and direct interaction with CoAP resources. The CoAP with\nproposed CSFSA scenario\
    \ is emulated in Cooja as shown in Figure 10. While in CoAP-DTLS\nscenario, mote\
    \ 1 is border router and motes 2–6 are CoAP servers and all the motes are\nplaced\
    \ in the transmission range of border router as shown in Figure 11. The CoAP-DTLS\n\
    scenario is used for results comparison with proposed CSFSA framework based CoAP.\n\
    Electronics 2022, 11, 963\n15 of 19\nFigure 10. Proposed CSFSA simulation scenario\
    \ consisting of 1 border router and 5 CoAP motes.\nFigure 11. CoAP-DTLS simulation\
    \ scenario consisting of 1 border router and 5 CoAP motes.\n5.3. Results\nThis\
    \ section describes the simulation results obtained. We appraised the results\
    \ of\nproposed CSFSA in terms of performance evaluation parameters i.e., packet\
    \ size, commu-\nnication overhead and power consumption.\nThe packet size is an\
    \ important evaluation parameter and have a signiﬁcant impact\non power consumption\
    \ particularly in constrained networks. For message transmission,\nthe standard\
    \ CoAP requires one round trip. In proposed CSFSA framework, the authen-\ntication\
    \ messages require two round trips as compared to CoAP-DTLS scheme, which\nprocesses\
    \ it in four round trips i.e., three round trips for DTLS and one round trip for\
    \ CoAP.\nProposed CSFSA is lightweight and power efﬁcient as compared to CoAP-DTLS\
    \ and has\nsigniﬁcantly smaller packet size than CoAP-DTLS. Figure 12 illustrates\
    \ the packet size and\nthe number of messages for both proposed CSFSA framework\
    \ and CoAP-DTLS scheme\nduring transmission.\nFrom the ﬁgure, it is clear that\
    \ the packet size for our proposed CSFSA is smaller than\nthat of packet size\
    \ of CoAP-DTLS. Also the round trip time of our proposed CSFSA is lower\nas compared\
    \ to round trip time of CoAP-DTLS.\nCommunication overhead is deﬁned as the number\
    \ of extra messages or packets that\nhas been transmitted over network. The Standard\
    \ CoAP communication overhead does\nnot include extra packets for data transfer.\
    \ The DTLS adds extra communication overhead\nto secure CoAP. To establish DTLS\
    \ secure session, it adds 29 bytes to each datagram\ni.e., 8 bytes nonce and 8\
    \ bytes authentication tag. In CoAP-DTLS, DTLS handshake adds\nextra 29 bytes\
    \ as overhead to standard CoAP. In our proposed CSFSA, it requires only two\n\
    extra bytes communication overhead to the total number of transmitted bytes to\
    \ secure the\nElectronics 2022, 11, 963\n16 of 19\ncommunication between client\
    \ and server. Figure 13 shows the communication overhead\nfor both proposed CSFSA\
    \ and CoAP-DTLS scheme. Based on comparison, communication\noverhead in our proposed\
    \ CSFSA is lower as compared to CoAP-DTLS. Its means that our\nproposed CSFSA\
    \ is efﬁcient and has lightweight communication overhead.\nFigure 12. Packet size.\n\
    Figure 13. Communication overhead comparison.\nPower consumption is another important\
    \ metric, as it directly impacts the lifetime of\nIoT devices since IoT devices\
    \ are powered by small sized batteries. Proposed CSFSA is\nlightweight and has\
    \ signiﬁcantly smaller packet size than CoAP-DTLS. Hence, it consumes\nless power\
    \ and bandwidth as compared to CoAP-DTLS. The power consumption of pro-\nposed\
    \ CSFSA is measured through software based energy estimation tool called Energest\n\
    which is built in Contiki NG OS. The function energest_type_time () outputs the\
    \ clock ticks\nobtained from the time when IoT device is booted. The formula for\
    \ measuring the power\nconsumption is as follows:\nPower Consumption =\nEnergestValue\
    \ × Current × Voltage\nRTIMER_ARCH_SECOND × RunTime\n(8)\nwhere current, voltage\
    \ and RTIMER_ARCH_SECOND are constant, taken from Wismote\ndatahseet. Figure 14\
    \ shows the power consumption measured for both proposed CSFSA\nand CoAP-DTLS\
    \ scheme.\nElectronics 2022, 11, 963\n17 of 19\nFigure 14. Power consumption.\n\
    6. Conclusions\nAgriculture plays an important role in country’s economic growth.\
    \ In agriculture,\nthe yields or crops which are to be produced are sensitive\
    \ to changes in their environmental\nconditions and required controlled environment.\
    \ Conventional agriculture methods are not\nintegrated with IoT devices to provide\
    \ controlled environment, resulting in low crop and\nfruit yields. This necessitates\
    \ the integration of IoT technology in agriculture ﬁeld to boost\ncrop productivity.\
    \ However, the integration of IoT in agriculture ﬁeld introduces cyber\nsecurity\
    \ attacks and vulnerabilities. Such cyber attacks have the capability to adversely\n\
    affect the countries’ economies that are heavily reliant on agriculture. On the\
    \ other hand,\nthese IoT devices are resource constrained having limited memory\
    \ and power capabilities\nand cannot be secured using conventional cyber security\
    \ protocols. Therefore, designing\nrobust and efﬁcient secure framework for smart\
    \ agriculture are required and is main aim of\nthis paper.\nIn this paper, a Cyber\
    \ Secured Framework for Smart Agriculture (CSFSA) is proposed.\nThe proposed CSFSA\
    \ presented a robust and tamper resistant authentication scheme for\nIoT devices\
    \ using CoAP to ensure the data integrity and authenticity of smart agriculture\n\
    monitoring. The signiﬁcance of proposed CSFSA is to make resilient against various\
    \ cyber\nsecurity attacks i.e., replay attacks, Denial of Service (DoS) attacks,\
    \ resource exhaustion\nand is efﬁcient for constrained devices having limited\
    \ memory. Furthermore, the packet\nsize, communication overhead and energy consumption\
    \ are also computed to appraise\nefﬁciency of proposed CSFSA framework. As a result,\
    \ the proposed CSFSA can make a\nsigniﬁcant contribution to the problem of food\
    \ wastage and its security. Also the economic\nloss can be reduced greatly.\n\

    They propose a model that considers non-functional requirements such as availability,

    19 SECTIONS PDF TOOLS SHARE Abstract The entire world is moving towards the era
    of smart technology. Internet of Things (IoT) is the key factor behind this revolutionary
    change. IoT converts real-world objects into interactive smart systems which can
    be controlled from remote locations. These physical real-world objects tagged
    as ‘Things’ in IoT should have a unique identity. These ‘things’ can be remotely
    controlled and monitored from anywhere in the world through Internet. Due to this
    feature it has been applied in various domains like home automation, patient health
    monitoring, agricultural sector, environment surveillance and so on. Due to the
    increased use of IoT-based system, there arises a need for a well-defined software
    architecture. Though various IoT developers follow their own design strategies
    for IoT architecture, there is a need for domain specific architecture for IoT
    applications. The authors propose a software architecture pattern selection model
    which can be followed in designing IoT systems. Non-functional requirements such
    as scalability, availability, reliability, security and heterogeneity determine
    the decision making of the proposed model. Analytical results prove that this
    model can be used as a reference model, for IoT developers in choosing a suitable
    software architecture pattern for their IoT system. 1 Introduction Internet of
    Things (IoT) is an emerging field which can play a vital role in almost all fields
    and disciplines including agriculture, health sector, home automation, aviation,
    transport, defence and military applications. IoT is an inter-networked collection
    of various physical things embedded with network connectivity, software, actuators
    and sensors for data collection and data processing [1]. IoT converts real-world
    objects into interactive smart systems which can be controlled from remote locations.
    These physical real-world objects tagged as ‘Things’ in IoT should have a unique
    identity [2]. Things are usually interconnected using a wireless communication
    mode. Actuators and sensors use various sorts of connections like wireless fidelity,
    near-field communication, radio frequency identification, Bluetooth, ZigBee and
    even use wide area connectivity like GSM, 3G, LTE and so on [1]. The typical IoT
    architecture is illustrated in Fig. 1. It is simply a networked set of devices
    and software embedded components. The embedded system may consist of a mini processor
    or boards which has some processing capability, for example, Raspberry PI [3],
    Arduino [4], Intel Galileo [5] and so on. IPv6 addressing is used, though it can
    address up to millions of device. There will be some application domain where
    the central things or sensors are deployed for monitoring and controlling. It
    will sense the relevant information and will pass towards some cyber physical
    system which performs the computation and coordination. Every component is networked
    for data communication. Based on the provided instructions or feedback, the actuators
    will initiate the necessary actions to be performed. Fig. 1 Open in figure viewer
    PowerPoint Typical architecture of IoT Though software plays a critical role in
    IoT system, there arises a need for a well-defined software architecture. The
    software architecture of a program or software system consists of various components
    (modules) in that system, externally visible properties of those components and
    the inter-relationship between those components [6]. Software architectures are
    described in terms of components, connectors and configurations. Architectural
    components describe the computations and state of a system; connectors describe
    the rules of interaction among the components; configurations define topologies
    of components and connectors. Architectural design is the process of defining
    a set of hardware and software components and their interfaces to establish the
    framework for the development of a computer system [7]. Requirements of the software
    should be transformed into an architecture that describes the software''s top-level
    structure and identifies its components. This is accomplished using architectural
    design and pattern selection. It is not feasible to follow all the traditional
    software architectural patterns for IoT application development. The traditional
    software pattern selection primarily depends on functional requirements. However,
    in case of IoT systems much priority is given to non-functional requirements.
    So the existing pattern selection tools or models may not be applicable for IoT
    domain. Existing pattern selection tools and their limitations in applying IoT
    domain are discussed in related works section. Though these tools are good in
    recording, documenting and making architectural decisions, they are not successfully
    evaluated in IoT perspective. Still there exist some gap between architectural
    pattern selection for generic software and that for IoT system. The possible solution
    is to select the architectural patterns based on some empirical evaluation or
    by analysing real-time IoT projects. Our research focuses to resolve the following
    queries: Q1: How important is architectural pattern selection in IoT system design?
    Q2: How can we choose the best architectural pattern for an IoT system? Q3: How
    can we select an architectural pattern when system has heterogeneous nature? We
    propose an architectural pattern selection model to resolve the above said queries
    based on some real-time case studies on IoT systems. The performance evaluation
    and results are discussed. This paper includes six sections as follows: Section
    2 reviews the related works about various existing software architecture pattern
    selection models; Section 3 illustrates the necessity of an IoT architecture pattern
    selection model. It also provides an overview regarding software architectural
    styles and patterns which can be applied in IoT based system; Sections 4 and 5
    discuss about the case study and its experimental evaluation using real-time IoT
    systems and finally we summarise our conclusions. 2 Related works Janson and Bosch
    [8] presented a new perspective which views software architecture as a set of
    explicit design decisions. They presented Archium model which portrays the mapping
    between design decisions and software architecture. Márquez and Astudillo proposed
    [9] a model called COMPACT for selecting components using some architectural tactics.
    From the non-functional requirements, the proposed model follows some tactics
    to search and identify the suitable components for design. They have deployed
    this model in health-care centre. The real-time evaluation pointed out that COMPACT
    is not using any criteria to select the software components. Márquez and Astudillo
    [10] addressed this challenge by proposing a new model for selecting the software
    components from business scenarios. This work describes the necessity of building
    a bridge between software architecture and system requirements. They created a
    semantic recommendation system, which will generate component assemblies from
    business scenarios. Their work offers a solution for assembling software components.
    It also tries to find relationships among various components and thereby help
    the software architects in decision making. Capilla et al. [11] proposed a web-based
    tool, which is capable of recording and managing architectural design decisions.
    That tool will assist various stakeholders to upload architectural patterns and
    styles in a repository. The decision-making process provides facility to the user
    to select the design pattern and style which is applicable for their domain. This
    tool fails to address design decisions based on quality attributes. Jansen et
    al. [12] developed a tool for making architectural decisions. This system documents
    the architectural decisions in semi-automatic manner and shares it with all the
    stakeholders. They have used Archium tool for the implementation and evaluation
    phase. Similar to Capilla''s model [11], this too fails to address the architectural
    pattern selection based on quality attributes. Nocera [13] proposed a fuzzy ontology
    based web framework for supporting architectural design. It proposes a framework
    to represent the relationship between non-functional requirements and software
    design patterns. This system provides the minimal subset of patterns applicable
    for the given sample of non-functional requirements. Most of the existing work
    focuses on documenting and storing of architectural discussions using some tools.
    Some use the concept of fuzzy logic during the software development. But none
    addresses the pattern selection methodology for IoT-based systems. In this scenario,
    our proposed model can assist the project manager to choose the suitable architectural
    pattern for their project by considering the non-functional requirements. Most
    of the IoT-based systems use different software architecture patterns based on
    various communication protocols, hardware components and central processing device
    that are used in the system. The tradeoff in design is between performance and
    uniform interoperable protocol design. Uniformity in protocols decreases the system
    performance in some application domains. Scalability is also a big challenge for
    the designers. Scalability is the ability of a system to expand its capacity and
    boundaries whenever needed without affecting the underlying base architecture
    and capabilities. We analyse the various software architectural patterns for IoT
    based on parameters like availability, scalability, reliability, interoperability,
    performance, security, privacy and ease of use. We replicated various small-scale
    IoT projects in same domain to validate the above-mentioned parameters and to
    study the pros and cons of each model. 3 Software patterns for IoT systems IoT
    differs from other web applications and embedded system applications due to the
    following characteristics: Integrated system with hardware, software, sensors,
    connectors and gateways. Live data stream analytics with complex event processing.
    Support for data volume and velocity. Visualisation of big data. Cloud services
    and computing. Various interoperable communication protocols. Due to the above
    said characteristics, it is not an easy task for the IoT architects to derive
    a suitable architectural pattern for IoT-based systems. Factors to be considered
    in IoT design are listed below. Dynamic environment: We cannot follow the design
    principles of software applications working in a defined environment though it
    deals with the integrated working of various sensors and device controlled by
    some application software. Complexity: Though IoT system operates on multiple
    device and communication protocols, there is a large set of use cases which makes
    the architectural design complex. Scalability: It is not an easy task to design
    a scalable architecture though most IoT-based systems are dynamic and there will
    be a need to expand the system boundaries and capabilities at any time. Reliability:
    Due to the inter-processing and intercommunicating device, the system reliability
    is to be considered while designing the architecture. Security: Subsystems and
    components may be managed by third parties which may lead to privacy and security
    issues. Integration of hardware and software: Though IoT system uses much hardware,
    it is necessary to define a scheme which will integrate the required hardware
    and software. We analyse the following software architectural patterns and styles
    [14, 15] that can be applied for designing IoT-based software systems. Our aim
    includes: Developing a reference model to choose suitable architectural patterns
    or styles for each IoT application. Identifying the alternate architectural patterns
    that can be followed in designing an IoT application. Analysing the capabilities
    and features of each available IoT architectural patterns. Listing out the parameters
    or metrics to be considered while choosing a suitable architectural pattern. 3.1
    Client–server architecture Client–server architecture [16] is a typical software
    architectural model followed in web-based software. Here the client always initiates
    the communication with the server system by sending a request and suitable response
    is provided by the server. In this scenario, the server should be always active
    and the client should be aware of the server network address. A server can act
    as a client to any other servers based on various tiered architectures. In an
    IoT system, server can be central storage or processing system and clients are
    various mobile device or monitoring or sensing device used in the IoT environment.
    A typical client–server architecture is illustrated in Fig. 2. In an IoT-based
    system, we can follow two variants of this client–server model: centralised cloud
    model and centralised hierarchical model. Fig. 2 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint
    Client–server architecture model In centralised cloud model there will be a central
    server usually a cloud system which is connected to various clients with user
    interfaces. Clients can be either mobile device or device used in IoT environment
    for data sensing or monitoring. Each IoT environment may deploy with a subset
    of various cloud-based model to provide improved scalability and availability.
    In centralised hierarchical model, there will be central nodal server which is
    connected to a set of IoT devices and is also a client for another set IoT-based
    system. This pattern is specifically applicable for intercommunication between
    various IoT-based systems in a wide environment such as weather monitoring in
    a region, forest fire detection, air pollution monitoring and so on. Though all
    the clients are communicating with the centralised cloud server, server load will
    be more in centralised cloud model system. Increased workload of the server results
    in decreased performance and scalability. If the central server cannot withstand
    the incoming client requests, there will be a chance of server crashing which
    may further lead to the entire system failure. This disadvantage can be resolved
    by using a centralised hierarchical model. Centralised model uses various interconnected
    clusters of client–server architecture. Suitable load balancing algorithms [17]
    can be followed for uniformly distributing the client requests among clusters.
    Improved performance, scalability and availability are the pros of using hierarchical
    model in designing IoT systems. Another challenge for the designers is to integrate
    the different communication protocols used in various subsystems. Device and cloud
    storage may use different protocol hierarchy. This mismatch of protocols is to
    be resolved by choosing some interoperable protocol models. 3.2 Peer-to-peer architecture
    Peer-to-peer is a variant of client–server architecture [16] where every system
    has equal priority. Each system can act as either client or server at instances
    based on the service they demanded for. This model is widely applicable in IoT
    domains like smart irrigation projects in agricultural sector, militrary applications
    and so on. Here the sensors are deployed in every subsystem and they sense the
    data and will process the data by itself. Each subsystem may be equipped with
    some low-powered device with minimum processing capability. This data can be sent
    to other neighbourhood systems whenever it is needed. So single system can act
    as both client and server. Typical peer-to-peer architecture is illustrated in
    Fig. 3. In this model, all peers use same communication protocol. This might not
    be feasible in all scenarios since various IoT devices provide various range of
    functionalities. This similarity constraint of peers makes this model much better
    in terms of scalability and performance aspects. Fig. 3 Open in figure viewer
    PowerPoint Peer-to-peer architecture model 3.3 Publisher–subscriber architecture
    This can be considered as one of the most unexplored architectural styles used
    in an IoT-based system. It consists of three categories of communication systems
    such as publisher, subscriber and a broker. Publisher: Sources of data and send
    data to brokers. Consumer: Subscribe to the topics managed by brokers. Broker:
    Receives data for a topic from a publisher and sends data to all the subscribed
    consumers. In this model, the publisher publishes the data to a broker. The consumers
    who all are interested in receiving this published data will register with central
    broker. The broker provides the published data to the needed consumers based on
    priority schedulers. This applicable IoT domains of this model include traffic
    alert system for drivers in highways, intrusion detection in a sensitive area,
    health monitoring applications and so on. This model can be applied whenever we
    require a model in which the receiver of some sensed data is a limited population.
    Here the consumer is interested only in receiving the data of their interest regardless
    of the source of data. The publish–subscribe style is illustrated in Fig. 4. Fig.
    4 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Publisher–subscriber architecture model Though
    the data is provided only to the subscribed authenticated receivers, security
    and privacy of data can be maintained in this system. The disadvantage of this
    model is that the producer will never get a feedback message from consumer. Thus,
    producer cannot ensure whether the required actions are performed or not. For
    instance, consider a home automation system integrated with an android app of
    the house owner. The house owner provides command to the home automation system
    to ‘power off’ through his user interface. The home automation central system
    may act as the broker and may send signal to the actuator to power off. The actuator
    may perform the action but does not provide the feedback of the actions performed
    to the house owner. This is a challenge for the designer to use this architectural
    model in IoT-based system. Another challenge in this scenario is the bandwidth
    and latency of producer and consumer should be almost unique. Otherwise there
    is a chance of occurring request flooding. This can be resolved by using a variant
    of publish–subscribe model called push–pull architecture as shown in Fig. 5. Fig.
    5 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Push–pull architecture In this variant the
    publisher pushes the data to a queue. The consumers will pull out the subscribed
    information from the queue. The challenge in publish–subscribe IoT model is the
    difficulty in addressing various individual devices and subsystems used in IoT
    environment. 3.4 Representational state transfer (REST) architecture REST architecture
    is a software pattern similar to client–server architecture. Here the various
    device components use a uniform interface, thereby improve the interoperability
    of IoT system. The tradeoff is between interoperability and system performance
    though the data is to be transformed to the various forms based on communication
    protocols rather than end-user needs. A typical REST model [1] is illustrated
    in Fig. 6. Fig. 6 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint REST architecture It designs
    web APIs based on system resources and how they are addressed or transferred.
    It uses request–response communication model. The interface constraints between
    client and server must possess uniformity. Each resource is identified with uniform
    resource identifier and separated from resource representations. Resource representation
    holds information about deleting or updating resources along with appropriate
    messages. It can be used for IoT application that runs on private intranet or
    even bigger public Internet-based networks. Reusability of sensors and actuators
    is one of the advantages of this architectural style. The uniform interface improves
    interoperability which may result in decreased system performance. Though these
    are the widely used architectural patterns for IoT-based systems, it is possible
    to use repository architecture (black board style), layered architecture, pipe
    and filter patterns and so on in particular domain-specific IoT systems. 4 Proposed
    architectural pattern selection model Though there are various software patterns
    available, still designers are incapable of choosing right pattern for the right
    system. In order to address this ambiguity we propose an architectural pattern
    selection model. This model can be used as a reference model for IoT system developers
    while choosing the architecture pattern which well suits for their requirements.
    The model is derived by considering the following IoT architectural design constraints
    listed below. Scalability: Scalability is the ability of a system to expand its
    capacity and boundaries whenever needed without affecting the underlying base
    architecture and capabilities. Availability: It can be defined as the ratio of
    time in which a system is available for functioning to the total time it is supposed
    to be functioned. Reliability: It is the ability of a system to consistently provide
    the expected outcome to the intended user. It can be defined as the probability
    at which the system provides the functionality accurately and precisely. Its value
    ranges between 0 and 1. Interoperability: The capability of a system and subsystems
    to work together without flaws regardless of the protocol or methods used. Security:
    Ensuring whether the system is vulnerable to various security threats like unauthorised
    access, hacking, misuse or manipulating data and so on. Privacy: Ensuring the
    data which is collected or sensed is transmitted only to the authorised person
    or subsystems. Performance: It can be described using various factors like capacity,
    utilisation of resources and response time. Our proposed model forces the software
    architect to tradeoff between interoperability and security. It is practically
    a difficult task to design an IoT system of heterogeneous nature with high security.
    So if the designer''s choice is to design an interoperable system, the decision
    tree shown in Fig. 7 can be used as reference model; else if the choice is for
    security, follow the model illustrated in Fig. 8. The pseudocode regarding the

    4.2 Interoperability-based pattern selection (IBPS) One of the critical challenges
    in designing IoT-based system is incorporating the interoperability feature. The
    IBPS is illustrated in Fig. 7. Software architect should first point out whether
    the proposed system consists of homogeneous or heterogeneous things [18]. Most
    of the IoT systems are heterogeneous, though it uses different class of devices,
    networks and communication protocols which can be implemented using typical client–server
    pattern. The con of client–server pattern is less availability which can be resolved
    by following a REST architecture. In case of homogenous things with similar features,
    scalability and availability may be the major concern for the architect. In this
    scenario, peer-to-peer pattern provides better availability and can be easily
    scalable. Publish–subscribe is not a good choice in terms of performance aspects
    but works well when security plays a vital role. 4.2 Security-based pattern selection
    (SBPS) SBPS is shown in Fig. 8. Security of data is a major concern in critical
    IoT applications like military, industrial automation, health monitoring and so
    on. Though the data is transferred between various communication objects, sensors
    and actuators, there is a possibility for the intruder to manipulate or steal
    the data. Preventive measures should be done in the root level itself by providing
    a secure and stable software architecture pattern. Publish–subscribe architecture
    is the best choice for highly secure devices with more privacy. Client–server
    architecture ensures security. But privacy cannot be guaranteed always though
    it is more vulnerable to attacks. The pattern selection decision tree for privacy
    concerns (upper sub-tree) is illustrated in Fig. 8. The next major expectation
    from most of the real-time IoT projects deal with performance aspects. The sensors
    or data collectors may fetch the data and will send or update to some remote server
    or a central controller. The performance in this scenario mainly depends on the
    hardware capabilities, bandwidth used for data transfer, state of the things (moving
    or stationary) and so on. An efficient system should be always available whenever
    the client initiates a request and should be capable of responding to the client
    request in minimal time. In this scenario, peer-to-peer architecture plays a crucial
    role. Though every connected system acts as both client and server at a time,
    the load for each system is comparatively less and is capable of providing load
    balancing mechanisms [17, 19] to improve performance. REST architecture suits
    well for low-powered device with limited performance capabilities. It is lightweight
    and is capable of providing quick response for client requests. The decision tree
    (lower sub-tree) for selecting architecture pattern based on performance is shown
    in Fig. 8. 5 Case study and experimental analysis We have evaluated the capabilities
    and performance of various architectural styles based on the parameters discussed
    in Section 4. These are considered as the various constraints that can be used
    for determining the suitable software architecture scheme to be used in an IoT-based
    system. The execution of our architectural pattern selector based on the pseudocode
    is shown in Fig. 10. Fig. 10 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Pattern suggestion
    based on user input For experimental validation of our model, we replicated various
    versions of IoT-based smart farm irrigation systems based on the above-mentioned
    architectural patterns. IoT can perform an appreciable task by deploying sensors
    in the fields to monitor various factors like water level, temperature level,
    humidity level, soil PH values, fertiliser content in soil and so on, and hence
    monitoring and controlling the various farming phases. Ram et al. [20] proposed
    an IoT system for regulating water in the agricultural fields. Nagothu [21] proposed
    an automatic field watering system using ARM processor. Agrawal and Singhal [22]
    proposed a water dripping scheme that will inject water directly to the root base
    of a plant. Based on the above-listed projects, we executed a case study using
    various software architectural patterns as mentioned below. We replicated above
    systems [23] using Raspberry PI and Arduino boards along with soil moisture sensors
    for our experimental analysis. Different architectural patterns are used for the
    same scenario. The experimental evaluation is performed for all patterns and detailed
    analytics are discussed in our blog [23]. Though security is not a major concern
    in case of smart agriculture, we evaluated the performance aspects of these systems
    by considering the various parameters like availability, reliability, scalability
    and interoperability. Reliability ‘R’ of the system is calculated using (1) Availability
    ‘A’ of the system is calculated using (2) We evaluated all the four systems for
    a period of 24 h to measure the system availability and reliability. The measured
    values are rounded up to the nearest integer as shown in Table 1. Table 1. Estimated
    reliability and availability for architectural patterns Architectural pattern
    MTBF, h MTTR, h R A client–server 23 0.3 0.95 96.50% peer-to-peer 23.8 0.1 0.98
    99.17% publish–subscribe 22.5 0.8 0.91 91.46% REST 22.8 0.3 0.97 97.64% R, reliability;
    A, availability. Scalability is measured by following load scalability. We evaluated
    the system by performing vertical scaling. We add the load of the central coordinator
    by adding more sensors and actuators. Though we make every node as processing
    element in peer-to-peer architecture, we can measure the performance tuning versus
    hardware scalability. It is much better to add more processing nodes instead of
    increasing the capability and capacity of a single node. It can be computed using
    Amdahl''s law (3) where P is the number of processing nodes; α is the fraction
    of computation that is sequential; 1−α is the fraction of computation that can
    be parallelised. The computed scalability metrics based on performance tuning
    for the various case study models are illustrated in Table 2. Experimental discussion
    is provided in the blog [23]. Table 2. Estimated performance tuning of architectural
    patterns Architectural pattern Number of processing nodes SCF (α) Speed client-server
    2 0.2 1.66 peer-to-peer 4 0.1 3.07 publish–subscribe 1 0.6 1 REST 1 0.5 1 SCF,
    sequential computation fraction. Interoperability concerns how well the discrete
    system components work together. Ducq et al. proposed a quantitative metric model
    [23] for measuring interoperability but is not widely accepted. Still interoperability
    is a sort of qualitative metric. We evaluated the interoperability of various
    architectural patterns by retrieving opinions from software architects and academicians
    works in IoT fields. Based on their experience and knowledge they used to rate
    the interoperability capability of each architectural pattern in a point scale
    of 1 to 5. Point 1 shows less interoperability and it slightly increases for each
    point, where point 5 shows strong interoperable capability. We also requested
    the experts to rate the ease of design for each architectural pattern. We estimated
    the average rating for each architectural pattern based on expert feedback and
    is shown in Fig. 11. Fig. 11 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Interoperability
    versus ease of design for architectural patterns Security and privacy can be ensured
    by providing authentication and authorisation in each layer of publish–subscribe
    architectural style. Asymmetric public key cryptography in device level and pretty
    good privacy (PGP) can be considered as a method of creating secure sockets layer
    (SSL) sessions between device and applications. Device management policies like
    usage of device identity, device registration, secure key registration and so
    on can be followed along with end–end encryption in storage and transmission of
    data. Based on the system architectural analysis [23], we derived the following
    characteristics as shown in Table 3 for each architectural pattern. The evaluation
    results are illustrated in Fig. 12. A software architect can map his various system
    requirements or constraints with the various parameters considered in Table 3.
    Based on the constraint cases, they can choose an architectural design which is
    much suitable and relevant for their IoT-based system. Different architectural
    patterns are applicable for different IoT use cases. It will be much effective
    if the architect chooses a pattern in such a manner that it can be reusable for
    similar use case classes. Table 3. Comparison of architectural styles based on
    non-functional capabilities Parameters Client–server Peer-to-peer Publish–subscribe

    architectural patterns Thus, our experimental evaluation confirms the validity
    of proposed architectural pattern selection scheme. By considering the IoT system
    requirements and applicability the system architect should tradeoff between the
    non-functional parameters. Though the existing models failed to address the IoT
    pattern selection methodologies, our decision model can be a reference model for
    the IoT architects. This model will suggest an architectural pattern for heterogeneous
    as well as for secure IoT systems. Our experimental analysis proves the importance
    of choosing the right software architecture pattern. If we fail to choose the
    appropriate pattern, it will result in low performance or even system failure.
    6 Conclusions IoT made a drastic change in the entire world and has made much
    impact in man''s day-to-day life activities. Everything that we see in our real
    world is made smarter by using suitable sensors and actuators with a central controlling
    system. Though this IoT-based system design is in its early stage of advancements,
    there is lack of proper architectural pattern selection models that can be applied
    to IoT systems. Our work suggests some commonly used software architectural styles
    and patterns that can be integrated with the IoT-based system so that the resultant
    system will perform with improved efficiency, scalability, heterogeneity, availability
    and interoperability. We propose an architectural pattern selection model for
    the designers to easily choose the architecture for their need. This model will
    suggest an architectural pattern for heterogeneous as well as for secure IoT systems.
    Our experimental analysis proves the importance of choosing the right software
    architecture pattern. If we fail to choose the appropriate pattern, it will result
    in low performance or even system failure. The future work may incorporate various
    hybrid lightweight architectural models that can be implemented in IoT systems
    with power constraints and mobility. The inclusion of prediction models for architectural
    patterns selection is also under consideration. 7 References Citing Literature

    Graphical Abstract. \nI. \nINTRODUCTION \nIoT is a combination of worldwide data,\
    \ web associated \nitems or things, and is an integral component of the future\
    \ \nInternet. IoT focuses on the automation of processes by \nlessening human\
    \ interaction. In the process of automation, IoT \ncollects data using sensors\
    \ and processes the data using \ncontrollers and completing the automation processes\
    \ by using \nactuators [1], [2]. IoT in agriculture and farming focus is on \n\
    automating all the aspects of farming and agricultural methods \nto make the process\
    \ more efficient and effective. Traditional \napproaches in livestock management\
    \ (such as cattle detection) \nare not fully automated and have many inefficiencies\
    \ such as \nhigher human interaction, labour cost, power consumption, \nand water\
    \ consumption [1], [3], [4], [5], [6]. The central \nconcept of this review is\
    \ to analyse the IoT sub-verticals, \ncollected data for measurements and used\
    \ technologies to \ndevelop applications. It is essential to identify the most\
    \ \nresearched sub-verticals, data collections and technologies to \ncreate new\
    \ IoT applications in the future.  \n \n \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced\
    \ Computer Science and Applications, \nVol. 10, No. 4, 2019 \n12 | P a g e  \n\
    www.ijacsa.thesai.org \nThis review provides an overall picture of currently \n\
    developed IoT applications in agriculture and farming \nbetween 2016 and 2018.\
    \ \nAs a solution to the existing problems, researchers have \nfocused on smart\
    \ agricultural and farming automated systems \nwith the help of IoT [7], [8],\
    \ [9], [10].  IoT is the network of \nthings which identifies elements clearly\
    \ with the help of \nsoftware intelligence, sensors and ubiquitous connectivity\
    \ to \nthe Internet. In IoT, the data that collects from Internet-\nconnected\
    \ items or things contains with gadgets, sensors and \nactuators [1]. Many researchers\
    \ have focused on smart \nsystems for monitoring and controlling agricultural\
    \ parameters \nby enhancing productivity and efficiency. Smart systems \ncollect\
    \ data for measurements to get accurate results that can \nlead to appropriate\
    \ actions. Current use of smart agricultural \nsystems relates to collecting data\
    \ on environmental parameters \nsuch as temperature, humidity, soil moisture and\
    \ pH [11], \n[12], [13]. With accurate sensor data collection using a range \n\
    of different sensors, researchers have implemented smart \nagricultural systems\
    \ to make the farm process more effective \n[9], [14]. Research has mainly focused\
    \ on sub-verticals such \nas water management, crop management and smart farming\
    \ to \nmake processes automated by reducing human intervention, \ncosts, power\
    \ consumption and water consumption. \nThe automation process of agricultural\
    \ and farming \nreduced human interaction and improve the efficiency. The \nreason\
    \ for that is every country population depends on \nagriculture thus consumers\
    \ of these resources should use water \nand land resources optimally [19], [20].\
    \ Moreover, it is \nimperative to have good quality production and crop \nmanagement\
    \ in order to maximize profitability. Hence, IoT \nbase agricultural management\
    \ systems are integral for an \nagriculturally based country. The new systems\
    \ developed \nusing IoT technologies have reduced the drawbacks associated \n\
    with traditional approaches and provided many advantages to \nfarmers. For example,\
    \ IoT-based water management systems \ncollect environmental attributes such as\
    \ temperature, water \nlevel and humidity through the sensors and provide accurate\
    \ \nirrigation timing [19], [21]. In addition, crop management \nsystems developed\
    \ using IoT monitor the temperature, \nhumidity and soil through sensors thus\
    \ providing adequate \ninformation so that farmers can manage the crops \nappropriately\
    \ [25]. Overall, these IoT-based systems help to \nreduce human interaction, power\
    \ utilization and reduce cost in \nthe field of agriculture. Moreover, IoT-based\
    \ agricultural \nrelated applications have been used in the area of pest control,\
    \ \nweather monitoring, nutrient management and greenhouse \nmanagement. \nIoT\
    \ for agriculture uses sensors to collect big data on the \nagricultural environment.\
    \ It discovers, analyses and deals with \nmodels built upon big data to make the\
    \ development of \nagriculture more sustainable [34]. IoT can provide efficient\
    \ \nand low-cost solutions to the collection of data. Weather, \nWater Scarcity,\
    \ Soil fertility and Pesticides are the significant \nplayers in it. IoT will\
    \ make agriculture beneficiary. \nAgriculture and farming depend on water [35].\
    \ Farmers \ndepend on rainfall for all their agricultural needs. \nFertilizer\
    \ also plays a very significant role in the field of \nagriculture by helping\
    \ to increase the productivity of plants \n[36]. By using IoT, farmers can manage\
    \ soil condition more \neffectively and at less expense by monitoring them from\
    \ any \nlocation [37]. The primary objective of this study is how IoT \nand technologies\
    \ are used in conserving water, fertiliser and \nenergy in the agricultural industry\
    \ by combining new \ntechnologies. This has benefits for the development of the\
    \ \neconomy of countries as well as the wealth of the people [38]. \nWith the\
    \ combination of both advanced technologies in \nhardware and software, IoT can\
    \ track and count all relevant \naspects of production which can reduce the waste,\
    \ loss and \ncost [39]. The information needed to make smart decisions can \n\
    be obtained merely by using electronic devices [40]. IoT \ntransforms the agricultural\
    \ industry and enables farmers to \novercome different challenges. Innovative\
    \ applications can \naddress these issues and therefore increase the quality,\
    \ \nquantity, sustainability and cost-effectiveness of crop \nproduction [41],\
    \ [42], [43]. IoT provides more benefits to the \nfarming industry by improving\
    \ the health of animals through \nbetter food and environment, addressing the\
    \ labour shortage \nissue as well cost savings through automation, increase in\
    \ milk \nproduction, and increase in some animals during the breeding \nperiod\
    \ through detection of estrus cycle and additional \nrevenue streams from waste.\
    \ \nOur \nstudy \nhas \nanalyzed \nrecently \ndeveloped \nIoT \napplications in\
    \ the fields of agriculture and farming to address \ncurrent issues such as unnecessary\
    \ human interaction leading \nto higher labour cost, unnecessary water consumption\
    \ and \nwater-saving measures for the future, higher energy \nconsumption, energy-saving\
    \ measures for the future and crop \nmonitoring difficulties. According to our\
    \ analysis, we can \nidentify a focus on water and crop management as sub-\nverticals\
    \ in the agriculture and farming sectors. This survey \nalso focusses on other\
    \ agriculture and farming sub-verticals to \nidentify the gap between IoT application\
    \ developments in the \nleast researched areas. The IoT generates enormous data,\
    \ so-\ncalled big data (high volume, at a different speed and different \nvarieties\
    \ of data) in varying data quality. Analysing the IoT \nsystem and its key attributes\
    \ are the key to advancing smart \nIoT utilization. Therefore, the primary aim\
    \ of our paper is to \nexplore recently created IoT applications in the agriculture\
    \ and \nfarming industry to give the more profound understanding \nabout sensor\
    \ data collection, used technologies, and sub-\nverticals, for example, water\
    \ and crop management. The \nsecondary aim of this study is to analyse the current\
    \ issues \nsuch as higher human interaction, high labour cost, higher \nwater\
    \ consumption and save water for future, higher energy \nconsumption and save\
    \ energy/electricity for future, crop \nmonitoring difficulties in IoT for agriculture\
    \ and farming. \nThe remainder of this paper is as follows: In Section II we \n\
    include raw data collection methodology, data inclusion \ncriteria, and data analysis\
    \ methods. Finally, the results of \nAgriculture and Farming based on IoT Sub\
    \ verticals, Sensor \nData, and Technologies are presented in Section III, and\
    \ in \nSection IV we discuss the results. Section V concludes the \npaper. The\

    \ to \nanalyse relevant research papers. In particular, 60 peer-\nreviewed scientific\
    \ publications on IoT in the agriculture and \nfarming sectors published in scientific\
    \ journals between 2016 \nand 2018 were used. \n1) Collection of raw data: The\
    \ data gathered for this \nreview is from 60 peer-reviewed publications (2016-2018)\
    \ \nthat were collected from the IEEE database. All these \npublications have\
    \ different data applications that have been \nstudied and analyzed in this survey.\
    \ The attributes compared \nwere sub-verticals, data collection measurements,\
    \ used \ntechnologies, challenges in current approach, benefits, \ncountries and\
    \ drivers of IoT. \n2) Data inclusion criteria: To evaluate the data inclusion\
    \ \ncriteria a comparison table was drawn to include as the \nfollowing attributes:\
    \ Author, Sub vertical, Data collection \nmeasurements, Technologies, Benefits,\
    \ Challenges, Solutions \nand Drivers of IoT. Nevertheless, in our study, articles\
    \ were \nexcluded when the selected attributes were not present. In our \nanalysis,\
    \ the number of sensors, amount of data collected, \nunderlying \ntechnologies,\
    \ \nsensor \ntopology \nand \nother \nintermediate gateways were not included\
    \ since no information \ncan find with all the peer-reviewed publications (2016-2018).\
    \ \n3) Data analysis: We pooled and analyzed the reported \nstudies based on data\
    \ collected through peer reviewed articles \nand displaying emerging themes in\
    \ a table. The data sets \nincluded attributes such as Sub vertical, Data collection\
    \ \nmeasurements, Technologies, Benefits, Challenges, Solutions, \nCountries focused\
    \ on automation of the agriculture proses and \nDrivers of IoT. The descriptive\
    \ details of the study based on \nthe publication year were analyzed to observe\
    \ the results from \n2016 to 2018. \nIII. RESULTS \nThis review aims to analyse\
    \ the incorporation of IoT for \nthe development of applications in the agriculture\
    \ and farming \nsectors. The study focuses on sub-verticals and collecting data\
    \ \nfor measurements and technologies in the field of agriculture \nand farming\
    \ to increase productivity and efficiency with the \nhelp of the Internet of Things\
    \ (IoT). This study of IoT in \nagriculture and farming focuses on developing\
    \ a criterion \napproach with the help of agricultural environmental \nparameters\
    \ and IoT measures and technologies. In the field of \nagriculture, there are\
    \ many environmental parameters that \nneed to be considered to enhance crops,\
    \ reduce water \nconsumption and human involvement [44]. Moreover, there \nare\
    \ many sub-verticals that can be identified depending on the \ndifferences in\
    \ approach. \nIn this review, we have gathered articles which have \nfocused on\
    \ agricultural and farming sub-verticals from 2016 to \n2018. As shown in Fig.\
    \ 1, 23 sub-verticals were found \naccording to the results obtained and the topmost\
    \ area was \nwater management (28.08%). \nAs IoT depends on sensor data collections,\
    \ a vast amount \nof data needs to be gathered to identify or predict accurate\
    \ \nresults. This study indicates that many researchers have \nfocused on environmental\
    \ temperature (24.87%), humidity \n(19.79%) and soil moisture (15.73%) as environmental\
    \ \nmeasurements. As shown in Fig. 2, 28 types of data were \ncollected for measurements\
    \ with environmental temperature \nand humidity being considered the most critical\
    \ parameters for \nagriculture and farming. \nAs shown in Fig. 3, we have categorised\
    \ all technologies \nused in the articles. This study has identified Wi-Fi as\
    \ the \nmost used technology (30.27%) followed by Mobile \nTechnology (21.10%)\
    \ for both agriculture and farming. \nZigBee, another data transfer technology,\
    \ is also used but to a \nlesser extent. \nAccording to Fig. 4, the use of IoT\
    \ was more prominent in \nthe agriculture industry than the farming industry (Agriculture\
    \ \n– 76.1%, Farming – 23.8%). \n \nFig. 1. Agriculture and Farming Sub Verticals:\

    \ \nIn this review we have identified important attributes to \nanalyse the research\
    \ findings in agriculture and farming \nprocesses. We have gathered and analyzed\
    \ data by using 60 \nrecent scientific articles. Our survey shows the most \n\
    researched \nsub-verticals are \nwater \nmanagement, crop \nmanagement and smart\
    \ farming. Water management is the \nmost researched sub-vertical for the last\
    \ few years as most \ncountries mainly focus on the utilization of water resources\
    \ \ndue to its lack of abundance [61]. Irrigation patterns in \nagriculture influence\
    \ crop production making irrigation \nmanagement a central focus to increase productivity\
    \ [8], [10].  \nThe second most considered sub-vertical is crop management \n\
    due to the importance of producing food for a growing global \npopulation. It\
    \ is important to manage the quality, quantity and \neffectiveness of the agricultural\
    \ production for sustainability \n[13]. Although a study [18] discussed that the\
    \ widely used \nsensor data collections for measurements are soil conditions as\
    \ \npH and humidity, as per our analysis it shows environmental \ntemperature\
    \ followed by humidity and soil moisture are the \nmost commonly measured data.\
    \ \nIoT can further be defined as a fusion of heterogeneous \nnetworks including\
    \ chip technology that scopes gradually \nmore and more, expanding due to the\
    \ rapid growth of Internet \napplications such as logistics, agriculture, smart\
    \ community, \nintelligent transposition, control and tracking systems. \nAccording\
    \ to researchers’ analysis, in 2020 IoT objects will be \nsemi-intelligent and\
    \ an important part of human social life \n[46]. As analyzed in our review Wi-Fi,mobile\
    \ technology are \nthe technologies which have a wide range of demand in \nagriculture\
    \ and farming domain to monitor land and water \nresources in contrast to other\
    \ technologies [33], [35]. \nAlthough our results demonstrate the results in such\
    \ a way, a \nstudy [62] analyzed that use of RFID, a Wireless Sensor \nNetwork\
    \ (WSN) technology that can be effectively used to \nincrease the crop production\
    \ to meet the growing needs of the \nincreasing population. In developing countries\
    \ with limited \nInternet speed, the other IoT technologies utilised rather than\
    \ \nWi-Fi include Low-Power, Short-Range IoT Networks, low-\nrate wireless PAN\
    \ (LoRaWAN) or Low-Power and Wide-\nArea Networks. \nFurther research [61] shows\
    \ that WSN is used in many \napplications \nsuch \nas \nhealth \nmonitoring, \n\
    agriculture, \nenvironmental monitoring, and military applications whereas \n\
    our study demonstrates the agriculture sector using IoT in and \nfarming sector\
    \ using IoT. Our observations show that \nAgriculture is the primary source of\
    \ income in developing \ncountries, such as India with the sizeable geographical\
    \ area \nwhen comparing with other countries [9]. \nMost of the research studies\
    \ have performed on water \nmanagement by monitoring such environmental parameters\
    \ as \ntemperature, humidity and soil moisture [1], [3], [5], [19], \n[25]. Many\
    \ of the findings have focused on better water \nutilization, reduction inhuman\
    \ intervention and the cost of \nproduction [18], [27]. Future research could\
    \ draw more \nattention to further automate current processes in waste \nmanagement,\
    \ smart lightening and pest controlling sub-\nverticals by reducing existing drawbacks\
    \ since it has received \nthe least research attention in the considered period.\
    \ Fog \ncomputing, as an innovation with cross over any barrier \nbetween remote\
    \ data centres and IoT devices, should be \nconsidered in future IoT analysis\
    \ [63], [64], [65], [66], [67]. \nWhile IoT has solved many issues related to\
    \ agriculture and \nfarming there are limitations that we need to consider. Lack\
    \ of \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications,\
    \ \nVol. 10, No. 4, 2019 \n25 | P a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org \ninteroperability\
    \ and compatibility in devices, network \nflexibility issues when more devices\
    \ are connecting, and \nsensor lifetime is some of the limitations to be addressed\
    \ in \nfuture research. \nThis study has found that industry 4.0 in agriculture\
    \ \nfocuses on IoT aspects transforming the production \ncapabilities including\
    \ the agricultural domain. This study has \n[68] considered soil quality, irrigation\
    \ levels, weather, the \npresence of insects and pests as sensor data. Some of\
    \ the \nsignificant aspects they have been researched are the driver’s \nassistance\
    \ to optimise routes and shorten harvesting and crop \ntreatment while reducing\
    \ fuel consumption CISCO [69]. \nProducing enough food for the entire world is\
    \ a big challenge \nsince the global population is rapidly changing as well as\
    \ \nclimate change and labour shortage. Currently researchers \nhave focused more\
    \ on robotics to address these problems. A \ngrowing number of researchers and\
    \ companies have focused \non Robotics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to weeding\
    \ by \nreducing the amount of herbicide used by farmers. \nIn contrast to edge\
    \ computing, cloud computing requires a \nhigh-speed internet connection with\
    \ sending and retrieving \ndata from the cloud. As the process involves transferring\
    \ and \nreceiving data from the cloud, the process is time-consuming. \nSince\
    \ the data capacity is higher than bandwidth, it is always \nessential to process\
    \ data locally instead of sending data to the \ncloud. Edge computing is more\
    \ efficient than cloud processing \nwhen processing data since the capacity doubles\
    \ faster than \nthe bandwidth doubles [70]. Since IoT uses sensor data \ncollection\
    \ for decision making, to process collected data, the \ncloud, or the edge based\
    \ can be used on the system \nrequirements. \nStill, there are some challenges\
    \ associated with IoT system \ndeployment. Connecting so many devices to the IoT\
    \ network \nis the biggest challenge in the future following lack of \ntechnical\
    \ knowledge among farmers, current centralised \narchitecture to support IoT systems\
    \ is not much advanced as \nthe growth of the network, centralised systems will\
    \ turn into a \nbottleneck. Moreover, sensor battery capacity and lifetime and\
    \ \nsensor data storage also more concentrated when IoT system \ndeployment. Smart\
    \ farming is the association with new \nadvancements in technologies and the different\
    \ crop and \nlivestock, agriculture and farming in the digital age. Smart \nfarming\
    \ can deliver agriculture more beneficial for the farmer. \nThis is because decreasing\
    \ input resources will save farmers' \nmoney and labour, and hence, will increase\
    \ reliability [71] and \nbusiness outcome [72], [73]. \nFurthermore, studying\
    \ diverse approaches for fog \ncomputing structure [63], decision making using\
    \ prediction or \npattern analysis [74], [75], [76], big data databases [77] could\
    \ \nbe an exciting way to make the Internet of Things (IoT) into \nthe future\
    \ dominating technology. \nThis survey will fill the gap by the identification\
    \ of the \ndifferent IoT sub-verticals and data collections for the \nmeasurements\
    \ in the agriculture and farming process. Results \nare clearly showing that most\
    \ considered sub-verticals and \ndata collections for measurements in the field\
    \ of agriculture \nand farming. Our study also indicates the technologies used\
    \ \nfor IoT application development in the reviewed period. To \nsummarise this\
    \ survey, this has broader knowledge about IoT \napplications developed for automating\
    \ the agriculture and \nfarming process. Moreover, this study identifies most\
    \ \nconsidered \nsub-verticals, \ncollected \nsensor \ndata \nand \ntechnologies\
    \ for the development of IoT based applications in \nagriculture and farming sector\
    \ towards the significant \nimprovement of the business. \nTable II shows the\

     \n \nV. CONCLUSION \nFrom our observations from the 60 peer-reviewed \npublications\
    \ \n(2016–2018) \nin \ndiscussing \nthe \npotential \napplications of the Internet\
    \ of Things, it was found that water \nmanagement is the highest considered IoT\
    \ sub-vertical \nfollowed by crop management, smart farming, livestock \nmanagement,\
    \ and irrigation management with the same \npercentage. As per the observation,\
    \ the most critical sensor \ndata collection for the measurement is environmental\
    \ \ntemperature, environmental humidity and also there are some \nother such sensor\
    \ data also gathered for IoT applications as \nsoil moisture and soil pH. Wi-Fi\
    \ has the highest demand of \nusage in agriculture and farming industry, followed\
    \ by mobile \ntechnology.  Other technologies as ZigBee, RFID, Raspberry \npi,\
    \ WSN, Bluetooth, LoRa and GPRS have less demand in the \nagriculture and farming\
    \ sectors. When compared to the \nagricultural sector, farming industry has a\
    \ lesser percentage \namount using IoT for the automation. This survey could be\
    \ \nuseful for researchers for finding new ways and solution to \nchallenge in\
    \ the current agricultural era and for agricultural \nand farming industries to\
    \ make the automation process more \neffective and efficient, consequently, to\
    \ obtain the good \nbusinesses outcome. \nAUTHORS’ PROFILE \nR.M., S.W., and M.N.H.\

    \ to provide farmers with a\nlarge amount of information. Precision agriculture\
    \ (PA) is a management strategy that employs\ninformation technology to improve\
    \ quality and production. Utilizing wireless sensor technologies\nand management\
    \ tools can lead to a highly effective, green agriculture. Based on PA management,\n\
    the same routine to a crop regardless of site environments can be avoided. From\
    \ several perspectives,\nﬁeld management can improve PA, including the provision\
    \ of adequate nutrients for crops and the\nwastage of pesticides for the effective\
    \ control of weeds, pests, and diseases. This review outlines the\nrecent applications\
    \ of WSNs in agriculture research as well as classiﬁes and compares various wireless\n\
    communication protocols, the taxonomy of energy-efﬁcient and energy harvesting\
    \ techniques for\nWSNs that can be used in agricultural monitoring systems, and\
    \ comparison between early research\nworks on agriculture-based WSNs. The challenges\
    \ and limitations of WSNs in the agricultural domain\nare explored, and several\
    \ power reduction and agricultural management techniques for long-term\nmonitoring\
    \ are highlighted. These approaches may also increase the number of opportunities\
    \ for\nprocessing Internet of Things (IoT) data.\nKeywords: energy-efﬁcient; energy\

    1. Introduction\nWireless sensor network (WSN) technologies have rapidly developed\
    \ over the years. Ecological\nphenomena in a vast area can be monitored using\
    \ pervasive devices called motes or sensor nodes.\nBattery-powered WSNs comprise\
    \ several sensors, processors, and radio frequency (RF) modules.\nThe sensor nodes\
    \ or motes can communicate wirelessly through a communication link and forward\n\
    their data to a base station or coordinator node by communicating with a gateway.\
    \ The communication\namong sensor nodes depends on the merging of diverse sensors\
    \ from simple (i.e., humidity, pressure,\nand temperature) to complex (i.e., localization,\
    \ tracking, micro-radars, and images), thereby allowing\nWSNs to monitor a wide\
    \ range of surroundings to obtain precise information from the ﬁeld [1].\nAccordingly,\
    \ the sensing, storage, processing, and communication capabilities of sensor nodes\
    \ have\ncontinuously increased [2].\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781; doi:10.3390/s17081781\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n2 of 45\nWSNs have been\
    \ used in different applications, such as military, agriculture, sports, medicine,\
    \ and\nindustry. Agriculture can be considered as one of the most favorable facilities\
    \ for WSNs to improve\nfood crop yields and minimize the burden of farmers [3].\
    \ Several projects have been introduced in\nthe precision agriculture (PA) literature.\
    \ PA aims to prevent the application of the same management\nroutine to a crop\
    \ regardless of site circumstances and to improve ﬁeld management from several\n\
    perspectives. For instance, PA can minimize the wastage of pesticides for the\
    \ effective control of weeds,\npests, and diseases as well as guarantee that crops\
    \ receive an adequate amount of nutrients, thereby\nleading to a highly effective,\
    \ green agriculture. Speciﬁcally, PA is a management strategy that employs\ninformation\
    \ technology to improve agricultural quality and production. PA differs for traditional\n\
    farming in the sense that this process accurately identiﬁes variations and relates\
    \ the spatial data to\nmanagement activities. PA involves ﬁve stages, namely,\
    \ (i) data collection, (ii) diagnosis, (iii) data\nanalysis, (iv) precision ﬁeld\
    \ operation, and (v) evaluation [4].\nWSNs are used as cost-effective processes\
    \ to increase agricultural yield. Accordingly, WSNs have\nbeen used in different\
    \ agricultural applications, such as for monitoring climate and using soil nutrient\n\
    data to forecast the health of crops and the quality of agricultural products.\
    \ Irrigation planning can\nbe predicted using WSNs by observing weather conditions\
    \ (such as temperature and humidity) and\nsoil moisture. Other sensor nodes can\
    \ be added to the existing WSN to improve the parameters of the\nagricultural\
    \ monitoring system and to make the network scalable. However, some challenges\
    \ have\nhindered the agricultural application of WSNs, such as determining optimum\
    \ deployment schemes,\nmeasurement periods, routing protocols, energy efﬁciency,\
    \ cost, communication range, scalability, and\nfault tolerance [5]. For example,\
    \ the scattered deployment of sensor nodes with a long data-gathering\nperiod\
    \ can help extend the network lifetime. However, some factors may challenge the\
    \ selection of the\ndistribution region. When the agricultural ﬁeld faces many\
    \ obstacles, the communication link may\nbe weakened or lost as a result of signal\
    \ attenuation. The sensor nodes in WSNs are supplied from\nthe battery, thereby\
    \ preventing connections to the main supply in the deployment location. Reducing\n\
    power depletion and prolonging battery life are imperative for WSNs considering\
    \ their limited battery\npower. Although the application of WSNs has increased\
    \ constantly over the years, the manufacturing\nof batteries has not developed\
    \ at the same rate [6]. Therefore, WSNs are mainly limited by their\nbatteries\
    \ [7]. Among the aforementioned challenges, this paper focuses on energy management\
    \ and\nhighlights energy-efﬁcient and energy harvesting techniques that can be\
    \ used in agriculture.\nTo fulﬁll PA requirements, such as addressing the problems\
    \ resulting from the long distance\nbetween farms and base stations, a mobile\
    \ data connection service can be established by connecting\nunmanned aerial vehicles\
    \ or drones with the base station [4]. Such connection allows the sensor nodes\n\
    to relay their data to the base station within the wide area of the farm ﬁeld.\
    \ However, this solution is\nlimited by the quality of service of WSNs.\nThe main\
    \ contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:\n(i)\nThe potential of\
    \ using wireless communications protocols or technologies in agriculture was\n\
    investigated, and the technology with the best power consumption and communication\
    \ distance\nwas identiﬁed.\n(ii)\nThe taxonomy of energy-efﬁcient and energy harvesting\
    \ techniques was examined to address the\npower consumption problems in agriculture\
    \ and to identify those methods that are most suitable\nfor solving these problems.\n\
    (iii)\nThe existing solutions, applicability, and limitations of applying WSNs\
    \ in agriculture were\nreviewed and compared.\n(iv)\nRecent studies using WSN\
    \ in PA applications based on Internet of Things (IoT) were surveyed\nand compared\
    \ in terms of type of sensors and actuators, IoT end devices, IoT platforms, and\
    \ IoT\napplication layer.\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n3 of 45\n2. Wireless Communication\
    \ Technologies for Agriculture\nThis section presents the different wireless protocols\
    \ and standards that are used in agriculture.\nThese wireless technologies are\
    \ also compared to identify the most convenient technology in terms of\npower\
    \ consumption and communication range, where the two metrics are posed challenges\
    \ in current\nsolution of agriculture application [5,8]. IoT is a revolution for\
    \ the future realm where everything\nthat can utilize a connection will be connected.\
    \ Cellular technologies are grown and developed to\nplay a crucial role in the\
    \ IoT realm [9]. Narrowband-IoT (NB-IoT) is a new IoT system constructed\nfrom\
    \ current Long Term Evolution (LTE) functionalities. Subsequently, NB-IoT is possible\
    \ to share the\nspectrum of LTE without coexistence problems and to utilize the\
    \ same pieces of equipment, as well\nas it is possible to connect seamlessly into\
    \ the LTE main network. This permits all network facilities\nsuch as security,\
    \ tracking, policy, charging, and authentication to be totally supported [10].\
    \ The design\ngoals of NB-IoT cover high coverage area, extended battery life\
    \ (i.e., 10 years), high network size\n(52,000 devices/channel/cell), and low-cost\
    \ devices [10,11]. However, in the near future, NB-IoT\ntechnologies, such as\
    \ Long Range radio (LoRa) will take place in agricultural applications due to\
    \ low\npower consumption and preferably used when the agricultural information\
    \ are to be transmitted over\nlong distances.\n2.1. ZigBee Wireless Protocol\n\
    ZigBee wireless protocol is considered one of the best candidate technologies\
    \ for the agriculture\nand farming domains. Given its low duty cycle, ZigBee is\
    \ considered appropriate for PA applications,\nsuch as irrigation supervision\
    \ [12], water quality management, and fertilizer and pesticide control,\nall of\
    \ which require a cyclic information update. Based on this technology, the sensor\
    \ nodes in the\nagricultural ﬁeld can communicate with the router or coordinator\
    \ node over a long range (i.e., 100 m)\nwhen XBee Series 2 is used. ZigBee can\
    \ also reduce the communication distance by up to 30 m for\nindoor conditions\
    \ (i.e., greenhouses) [13]. The number of deployed sensor and router nodes will\
    \ be\nincreased to cover the entire ﬁeld area under surveillance. Some studies\
    \ have employed Zigbee for PA.\nFor instance, ZigBee was used to investigate the\
    \ effect of signal strength on node spacing, base station\nantenna height, and\
    \ leaf density [14]. In [14], three experiments were conducted in palm orchards\
    \ in\nto evaluate a signal propagation model based on the received signal strength\
    \ indicator (RSSI) of the\nZigBee wireless protocol. Through their experiments,\
    \ the authors concluded that the wireless channel\npropagation model must be determined\
    \ before deploying the sensor nodes in palm orchards to obtain\nrobust signal\
    \ strength characteristics. A path loss model in a mango greenhouse was investigated\n\
    based on the ZigBee wireless protocol [15].\nA cattle-localization-system-based\
    \ ZigBee WSN was also applied in a grazing ﬁeld [16]. Instead of\nrequiring additional\
    \ hardware, ZigBee relies on link quality indication (LQI) to measure distance.\
    \ The\nZigBee protocol achieves cattle localization at a low power consumption\
    \ and minimum cost. The key\nparameters of greenhouse climate (i.e., humidity,\
    \ temperature, CO2, and solar radiation) are considered\nin [17] to ensure the\
    \ comfortable growth of plants with 22% energy savings and 33% water usage.\n\
    ZigBee and Global System for Mobile communication/General Packet Radio Service\
    \ (GSM/GPRS)\ntechnologies were used to monitor and control the climate condition\
    \ of greenhouses [17]. The ZigBee\nwireless protocol has also been used to monitor\
    \ animal behavior (e.g., walking, grazing, lying down,\nand standing) [18]. ZigBee\
    \ was also adopted in [18] to overcome the high power consumption and\nunreliability\
    \ issues in mobile ad hoc WSNs.\nA WSN-based greenhouse that uses ZigBee star\
    \ topology is merged with artiﬁcial intelligence\n(i.e., fuzzy logic controller)\
    \ in [19]. The ZigBee wireless protocol is adopted to preserve energy by\nswitching\
    \ between active and sleep states. Thus, power consumption can be minimized, and\
    \ the\nbattery lifetime of sensor nodes can be extended. ZigBee is currently applied\
    \ in smart beehives [20],\norange orchards [21], dairy healthcare monitoring of\
    \ cows in pastures and barns [22], automation in\nirrigation [23], greenhouse\
    \ monitoring systems [24,25], and livestock monitoring [26]. As a universal\n\
    Sensors 2017, 17, 1781\n4 of 45\nstandard for WSNs, the ZigBee protocol was used\
    \ in several agricultural applications because of its\nlow power consumption,\
    \ low cost, self-forming characteristics, and suitable communication range.\n\
    2.2. Bluetooth (BT) Wireless Protocol\nThe BT standard has been utilized to establish\
    \ a communication link between movable and\nportable devices, such as laptops,\
    \ over a short distance of up to 10 m. Given its pervasive nature\nand availability\
    \ in most mobile devices, BT has been employed to satisfy multi-level agricultural\n\
    requirements [5].\nWeather information, soil moisture, sprinkler position, and\
    \ temperature are\nmonitored remotely using Global Positioning System (GPS) and\
    \ BT technologies. The proposed\nsystem in [27] was developed for irrigation application\
    \ to increase ﬁeld productivity and conserve\nwater. The irrigation application\
    \ proposed in [28] collects ﬁeld information in real time via the BT\nwireless\
    \ communication protocol. Several software and hardware were developed in [29]\
    \ to monitor\nthe relative humidity and temperature in greenhouses based on BT.\
    \ The BT module was employed in\nintegrated control method [30] to control the\
    \ irrigation system in greenhouses based on soil and weather\ninformation, and\
    \ this technology improved the leaf number, height, dry weight, and fresh weight\n\
    of red and romaine lettuce in greenhouses. Result of estimation for water usage\
    \ and electricity also\nimproved by 90% based on integrated control method using\
    \ BT technology relative to the traditional\nmethod (i.e., timer control strategy).\
    \ Given its low energy consumption, wide availability, and ease of\nuse for farmers,\
    \ smartphone-based BT has been employed in different agricultural applications\
    \ [31–35],\nsuch as controlling irrigation systems, monitoring soil and weather\
    \ conditions, and controlling the use\nof fertilizers and pesticides.\n2.3. WiFi\
    \ Wireless Protocol\nWiFi is currently the most extensively utilized wireless\
    \ technology available in portable devices,\nincluding tablets, smartphones, laptops,\
    \ and desktops. WiFi has a suitable communication distance of\nabout 20 m and\
    \ 100 m in indoor and outdoor environments, respectively. In PA applications,\
    \ WiFi\nextends diverse architectures by connecting several types of devices via\
    \ an ad hoc network. WiFi and\n3G wireless technologies were employed in [36]\
    \ to estimate the agricultural applications of mobile\nphones. Remote access and\
    \ short message services have also been used for controlling and monitoring\n\
    protected crops. In [37], agricultural data, such as soil temperature, soil moisture,\
    \ weather temperature\nand humidity, sunlight intensity, and CO2, were stored\
    \ in a gateway before they were transmitted\nto the server computer over a WiFi\
    \ network. A Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11g)-based smart WSN is proposed\nfor agricultural\
    \ monitoring in [38]. The proposed system consists of three nodes: sensor, router,\
    \ and\nserver. The climate conditions of the greenhouse or agricultural ﬁeld,\
    \ such as humidity, temperature,\nair pressure, light, water level, and soil moisture,\
    \ are monitored. The said work attempts to lower cost,\nminimize wiring connections,\
    \ and enhance the mobility and ﬂexibility of the sensing points in WSN.\nHowever,\
    \ the energy consumption of the proposed system is extremely high at 42.17 J/h.\n\
    Given that WiFi requires much power [5], long communication time, and huge data\
    \ payload [26].\nWiFi technology is not preferable for agricultural applications\
    \ in spite of the fact that a Wi-Fi server\nprevents data losses by adopting data\
    \ redundancy techniques. In addition, WiFi cannot be employed\nfor multi-hope\
    \ applications and inﬂuenced by number of users and the signal intensity; thereby,\n\
    it is inappropriate for agriculture WSNs. Moreover, the WiFi nodes listen all\
    \ the time, so power\nconsumption will increase [39].\n2.4. GPRS/3G/4G Technology\n\
    General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) is a packet data service for GSM-based cellular\
    \ phones.\nGPRS frequently experiences variable delays and throughputs, and such\
    \ technology depends on the\nvolume of consumers that share the same communication\
    \ channels and resources. Gutiérrez et al. [40]\nused the GPRS module and WSN\
    \ to develop an automatic crop irrigation system based on the\ninformation collected\
    \ by temperature and soil moisture sensors installed at the root zone of plants,\n\
    Sensors 2017, 17, 1781\n5 of 45\nand considered this system a cost-effective and\
    \ practical solution for improving water quality in\nPA. A drip irrigation process\
    \ was evaluated in [41] by measuring soil moisture. A prototype system\nwas also\
    \ developed based on a data management server and a WSN-GPRS gateway. WSN-GPRS\n\
    gateway acts as a bridge between WSN and GPRS where the data from the WSN are\
    \ transferred to a\ndata management center. Navarro-Hellín et al. [42] equipped\
    \ various wireless nodes with GPRS to\nmeasure and transmit soil, plant, and atmosphere\
    \ information. The wireless nodes have unlimited\nautonomy because of their independent\
    \ nature and use of solar energy. Different sensors may transmit\ninformation\
    \ to a remote location via a GPRS network for further analysis by using tablets,\
    \ mobile\nphones, or computers. All agriculture sensors are interfaced to the\
    \ sensor board to obtain agricultural\ninformation. Such information is transmitted\
    \ to the remote server for further analysis through the\nGPRS-board, which depends\
    \ on a GSM/GPRS mobile network.\n2.5. Long Range Radio (LoRa) Protocol\nLoRa is\
    \ introduced by the LoRa Alliance as a protocol stack for low power and wide area\
    \ Internet\nof Things (IoT) communication technologies that are associated with\
    \ indoor transmission [43]. The\nbasic network architecture of a LoRaWAN consists\
    \ of LoRa end devices, LoRa gateways, and a LoRa\nnetwork server. The LoRa end\
    \ device communicates with gateways that employ LoRa with LoRaWAN.\nLoRa gateways\
    \ pass raw LoRaWAN packets from the end devices to a LoRa network server with\n\
    a high throughput based on the backhaul interface, which is typically 3G or Ethernet.\
    \ Accordingly,\nLoRa gateways act as a bidirectional communication or protocol\
    \ adapter with the LoRa network\nserver. In this case, the LoRa network server\
    \ takes charge of decoding the data packets transmitted by\nthe LoRa devices and\
    \ creating the frames that would be directed back to the devices. LoRa offers\
    \ a\nbidirectional solution that matches machine-to-machine (M2M) WiFi or cellular\
    \ technologies. LoRa\npresents a cost-effective method for linking batteries or\
    \ mobile devices to the network or to end devices.\nThe LoRa wireless protocol\
    \ was used in [44] to monitor bee colonies in rural areas and to ensure a\ncommunication\
    \ between the bee node and the local server that is located in a remote location.\
    \ The\nsoil moisture and temperature, air temperature and humidity, and light\
    \ intensity inside greenhouses\nwere also monitored using different sensors, microcontrollers,\
    \ and the LoRa wireless protocol [8]. The\nLoRa gateway collects data from LoRa\
    \ nodes to construct the topology of a star network, and may\ncommunicate with\
    \ a cloud server over a long communication range and with high scalability.\n\
    LoRa was recently utilized in several agriculture research projects developed\
    \ by the Libelium\nCompany (Zaragoza, Spain) [45], such as improving kiwi production\
    \ based on a smart irrigation system\n(Italy), monitoring of green areas by using\
    \ a smart garden system (Spain), improving fertilization\nmethods of corn yields\
    \ (Italy), improving production of banana yields (Colombia), increasing\ntobacco\
    \ crops by controlling the climate condition (Italy), saving water through a smart\
    \ irrigation\nsystem (Barcelona), monitoring of vineyard crops (Spain), and monitoring\
    \ of diseases that affect\nvineyards (Switzerland).\n2.6. SigFox Protocol\nSigFox\
    \ is an ultra-narrowband wireless cellular network [43] with low data rate applications,\n\
    thereby making this technology appropriate for IoT and machine-type communications\
    \ systems.\nSigFox has been used in different applications, including telephone,\
    \ security, mobile, broadband, and\ntelevision. The SigFox network was used in\
    \ [46,47] to construct a geolocation system that localizes\nanimals in mountain\
    \ pastures throughout the summer. A system was proposed in [46] to help farmers\n\
    locate their cattle and enhance their production. The importance of power consumption\
    \ analyses was\nhighlighted in [47], especially when the cattle are located in\
    \ high mountainous areas.\n2.7. Performance Comparison of Wireless Communication\
    \ Protocols\nTable 1 compares the aforementioned wireless communication protocols\
    \ or technologies relative\nto different parameters, including power consumption,\
    \ communication range, data rate, cost, system\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n6 of 45\n\
    complexity, and other parameters. The challenges in agricultural applications\
    \ may be developed from\nthe selection of the deployment range. For instance,\
    \ the transmitted signal by the sensor node is\nattenuated when the agriculture\
    \ ﬁeld is separated by obstacles. Power consumption is considered as\nanother\
    \ limitation in the WSN design in agricultural applications [5]. The ZigBee wireless\
    \ protocol was\ndesigned to run with a suitable communication range and low power\
    \ consumption. LoRa and SigFox\nare considered to work with low power consumption\
    \ and long radio range. Accordingly, the power\nconsumption and communication\
    \ distance of the above technologies have been assessed as follows.\nZigbee and\
    \ Bluetooth low energy (BLE) are designed for battery-powered devices.\nThese\n\
    technologies conserve power through low duty cycling and enter sleep mode to extend\
    \ the battery\nlifetime. Classic BT, WiFi, GPRS, LoRa, and SigFox have a higher\
    \ power consumption than ZigBee.\nAlthough ZigBee has a shorter communication\
    \ range than LoRa, SigFox, and GPRS, this range may be\nextended with a router\
    \ node to overcome the node deployment limitations in agricultural applications.\n\
    BLE outperforms ZigBee in terms of power consumption, but this wireless protocol\
    \ is limited in\nagricultural applications because of its short communication\
    \ distance of 10 m, as reported in [48].\nZigBee also has a higher network elasticity\
    \ than BT, thereby permitting various topologies. Given the\nlarge number of nodes\
    \ (more than 65,000) in the ZigBee network, the ZigBee technology can be used\n\
    to cover a wide agricultural. Accordingly, the ZigBee wireless protocol has been\
    \ adopted in many\nagriculture studies [5,49–53]. One of these studies [5] prefers\
    \ to utilize ZigBee in farming domains and\nagricultural applications owing to\
    \ its energy-efﬁcient, reliable, and low-cost wireless protocol.\nThe LoRa wireless\
    \ protocol covers a large communication area with low power consumption.\nTherefore,\
    \ it can be suitably deployed in vast agricultural ﬁelds. The network size of\
    \ the LoRa protocol\nis limited by its duty cycle, where a 1% duty cycle can lead\
    \ to a maximum communication time of 36 s\nper hour for each end device [54].\
    \ In addition, LoRa gateways have a limited message capacity of less\nthan 100\
    \ messages per minute because of the unplanned deployment of LoRa gateways in\
    \ urban areas,\nthereby interfering with low power wireless area networks, such\
    \ as SigFox. Therefore, increasing the\nnumber of gateways can challenge the infrastructure\
    \ of the LoRa network [54]. Moreover, the LoRa\ntechnology is complex and has\
    \ sizable hardware implementations [55].\nSigFox has an extremely low data rate\
    \ (100 bps) and slow transmission time (10 s for 10 bytes)\ncompared with ZigBee\
    \ and LoRa [56]. SigFox supports star topology supervised by a centralized sever\n\
    that manages connectivity between devices and the base stations, whereas the LoRa\
    \ supports wide\narea network based on star-to-star topology creating a bridge\
    \ of LoRa gateways. Given that data rate\nand transmission time are both critical\
    \ issue in any communication system, SigFox cannot be widely\nused for agricultural\
    \ applications. Moreover, this technology does not support the collision avoidance\n\
    scheme, thereby affecting the network because several M2M devices may be operated\
    \ in the same\narea. Moreover, SigFox has a limited reliability because of its\
    \ one-way communication (without an\nacknowledgment signal) and low received power.\
    \ However, both the LoRa and SigFox infrastructures\nare still in progress. Ali\
    \ et al. further discuss the limitations of these protocols [56].\nFrom the above\
    \ discussion and the comparison results presented in Table 1 and Figure 1\nand\
    \ as will be shown in Tables 2–8 the ZigBee and LoRa wireless protocols have been\
    \ identiﬁed\nas the most suitable wireless protocols for agricultural applications\
    \ because of their low power\nconsumption, communication range (acceptable for\
    \ ZigBee and long for LoRa), small size, easy\nnetwork implementation, simplicity,\
    \ low latency (for ZigBee), scalability, and network size.\nSensors 2017, 17,\
    \ 1781\n7 of 45\n \ninfrastructures are still in progress. Ali et al. further\
    \ discuss the limitations of these protocols [56].  \nFrom the above discussion\
    \ and the comparison results presented in Table 1 and Figure 1 and as \nwill be\
    \ shown in Tables 2–8 the ZigBee and LoRa wireless protocols have been identified\
    \ as the most \nsuitable wireless protocols for agricultural applications because\
    \ of their low power consumption, \ncommunication range (acceptable for ZigBee\
    \ and long for LoRa), small size, easy network \nimplementation, simplicity, low\
    \ latency (for ZigBee), scalability, and network size. \n \nFigure 1. Different\
    \ wireless technologies in terms of power consumption and communication \ndistance.\
    \ \nFigure 1. Different wireless technologies in terms of power consumption and\
    \ communication distance.\nPA using sensors, actuator, processor, wireless transceiver,\
    \ and other information technologies,\npotentially permits manufacturers to computerize\
    \ site-speciﬁc management for automated agriculture.\nIn terms of precision, the\
    \ considered wireless protocols for agricultural applications have improved\n\
    the agriculture domain. Precision irrigation is frequently regarded as optimizing\
    \ irrigation accuracy\ndue to its ability to control the optimum amount of water\
    \ and irrigation time. The water savings\nof 90% (based on ZigBee), 33% (based\
    \ on ZigBee), 50% (based on Bluetooth), and 90% (based on\nBluetooth) were achieved\
    \ for precision irrigation systems relative to traditional irrigation systems\
    \ in\nresearch [17,28,30,40], respectively. Animal behavior, such as laying down,\
    \ standing, grazing, walking,\nand other modes, was monitored in [18] using ZigBee\
    \ wireless protocol. The authors found that\nlaying down and grazing could be\
    \ improved by 83.5% compared with the ﬁndings from similar\nstudies. In another\
    \ study that has adopted a proposed algorithm that depended on the ZigBee wireless\n\
    protocol [20], an accuracy rate of 95.4% was expected for the proposed algorithm\
    \ to monitor the\nhoney bee and the agricultural and environmental aspects. In\
    \ [23], the automation of the irrigation\nsystem based on ZigBee saved the system\
    \ cost between 1.24% and 6.72% relative to the entire cost\nof the water user\
    \ associations, with energy savings of 2.05 to 8.21% and water savings of 0.71\
    \ to\n6.46%. The proposed model in [35] utilized a smartphone platform (based\
    \ on Bluetooth and GSM\ntechnologies) and permitted three types of irrigation\
    \ systems. The efﬁciency factors were improved\nby 90% for subsurface drip type\
    \ and 85% and 75% for high- and low-pressure overhead sprinkler\ntypes, respectively,\
    \ to compute for drift and evaporation before the water droplets approached the\n\
    soil. 3G technology was adopted by Libelium based on Waspmote wireless sensor\
    \ devices to monitor\nthe vineyards in Northwest Spain [57]. Phytosanitary treatments,\
    \ such as fungicides and fertilizers,\nwere minimized by 20% and growing yields\
    \ were enhanced by 15% based on PA. In [8], LoRa wireless\nprotocol was considered\
    \ to monitor the agriculture environments with 90% power efﬁciency. The cost\n\
    of pumping and water for precision irrigation system in green areas was reduced\
    \ by 30% based on\nSigFox wireless protocol [58].\nThe preceding survey for different\
    \ agricultural applications revealed that PA can be achieved\nin terms of water\
    \ savings, animal behavior, accuracy, power efﬁciency, and reducing system cost\n\
    for various wireless protocols. Consequently, agriculture can be improved based\
    \ on agricultural\nautomation systems compared with traditional agriculture systems.\n\

    \ techniques of WSNs that can be used in\nagricultural applications. The purposes,\
    \ wireless protocols, ﬁndings, advantages, and limitations of\neach technique\
    \ are also discussed.\n3.1.1. Sleep/Wake Strategy\nWireless transceivers consume\
    \ a signiﬁcant amount of power relative to processors. The energy\nof the wireless\
    \ nodes is mostly dissipated during the reception and transmission processes.\
    \ The radio\nof sensor nodes can enter sleep mode via the sleep/wake strategy\
    \ to reduce the power consumption\nof the RF components of WSNs. No data communication\
    \ occurs during the sleep mode. The sensor\nnodes wake up to collect and transmit\

    \ In agricultural applications, the sleep/wake strategy is implemented via (i)\
    \ duty\ncycling, (ii) medium-access control (MAC) protocols, and (iii) topology\
    \ control.\nDuty cycle is proposed in several studies to lower the power consumption\
    \ for different agricultural\napplications based on WSN. Zhang et al. [69] proposed\
    \ a WSN-based system to monitor soil moisture\nand analyzed the temporal and spatial\
    \ variability of soil moisture for variable irrigation. To reduce the\npower consumption\
    \ of the soil sensor nodes, the soil moisture sensors were always in sleep mode\
    \ and\nactivated only when data were to be collected. Million et al. [70] designed\
    \ a WSN for PA in Malawi\nand called it WiPAM. This system was intended to automate\
    \ irrigation and implement an irrigation\nmanagement system (IMS). The authors\
    \ investigated soil moisture variability. The sensor nodes\nwere homogeneous,\
    \ and each was composed of a ZigBee end device (ZED) and a ZigBee coordinator\n\
    (ZC). In the star topology, three sensors nodes were conﬁgured as ZED (in ﬁeld-nodes)\
    \ and one as a\ngateway node. Another node was conﬁgured as ZC for aggregating\
    \ data and actuating the irrigation\nvalves. The power source to sustain the operation\
    \ of the network was solar power. This approach\nwas complemented by an energy-efﬁcient\
    \ management approach. In other words, sensor nodes went\nto sleep when idle and\
    \ woke up to transmit data when required. The irrigation valves opened or\nclosed\
    \ depending on the values stored in the coordinator node. Ouadjaout et al. [71]\
    \ presented an\nenergy-efﬁcient WSN for soil moisture monitoring in an irrigation\
    \ system. The new platform, DZ50,\nconsists of an RFM12b transceiver and an ATmega328P\
    \ microcontroller. This platform consumes very\nlow power, and much energy can\
    \ be saved in sleep mode, in which the transceiver goes inactive (sleep\nmode)\
    \ for long periods. Comparison showed that the performance of DZ50 is better than\
    \ that of\nTelosB and MicaZ. Speciﬁcally, the battery lifetime of DZ50 is seven\
    \ times that of TelosB and MicaZ\nbased on a 10 s sampling period. Monitoring\
    \ of environmental conditions, such as wind direction,\nwind speed, humidity,\
    \ temperature, conductivity, rain level, pH, and water level, in crop ﬁelds was\n\
    presented in [72]. A solar cell was used to power several sensor nodes deployed\
    \ at a distance of 500 m\nto 5 km. WSNs based on IEEE 802.15.4 (C1120 transceiver)\
    \ and GPRS/3G were adopted to transmit the\nrural environments to the base station.\
    \ Energy was saved through low duty cycling (3.3%) for the RF\ntransceiver; the\
    \ saved energy is equivalent to 30 s of wake up time every 15 min. In addition,\
    \ a 2-watt\nsolar cell was used to supply power to the overall system, whose total\
    \ average power consumption\nwas 207 mW.\nMAC protocols were also proposed in\
    \ previous research on agriculture WSNs [39,73–76].\nSudha et al. [39] proposed\
    \ an energy-efﬁcient TDMA-based algorithm for wireless sensor\ncommunications\
    \ in an automatic irrigation system. Their experiment involved a header node that\n\
    collected data directly from all the nodes in the ﬁeld and passed these data to\
    \ the base station (BS).\nThis network arrangement was a star single-hop topology.\
    \ These techniques attain power savings\nof 10% with a high communication distance\
    \ of 1 km between the sensor node and the base station.\nHowever, when this distance\
    \ increases, the power consumption also increases. López et al. [75]\nproposed\
    \ a WSN for monitoring horticultural yields, which are disseminated among small\
    \ plots\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n11 of 45\nscattered at a communication distance\
    \ of 10 km. The air temperature and soil moisture are collected\nduring a 10-week\
    \ period. The authors adopted the MAC protocol and star topology to conserve the\n\
    power consumption of the sensor nodes that used the IEEE 802.15.4 standard based\
    \ on the CC2420\ntransceiver. The lifetimes of the soil moisture and air temperature\
    \ sensor nodes are 1024 days and\n222 days, respectively, utilizing a battery\
    \ that delivers 2700 mAh.\nThe topology protocol scheme can be used in agricultural\
    \ monitoring WSNs to modify the network\ntopology according to the application\
    \ requirements, thereby reducing the number of active nodes in\na network. Some\
    \ nodes in the network can enter sleep mode to prolong the network lifetime when\n\
    they are not sensing the same area of interest. Aneeth and Jayabarathi [77] implemented\
    \ Ad hoc\nOn-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) and Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) protocols\
    \ over a different\ntopology of ZigBee WSN (i.e., cluster topology, random topology,\
    \ star topology with gateway based\non two cases; inside and outside) in simulation\
    \ environments by using the OPNET software (Riverbed,\nSan Francisco, CA, USA).\
    \ Twenty soil moisture sensor nodes and one gateway node were distributed\nin\
    \ a farmland with a dimension of 100 × 100 m2. Each node sends information about\
    \ the soil moisture\nto the gateway node through the ZigBee wireless protocol.\
    \ The gateway node passes the information to\nthe controlling system to control\
    \ the irrigation valve system. Their study showed that the star topology\nusing\
    \ DSR protocol reduces the power consumption of the WSN because it has less routing\
    \ overhead\ncompared with AODV protocol. Table 2 shows the comparison of power\
    \ reduction technique based on\nsleep/wake schemes for previous research in agricultural\
    \ applications.\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n12 of 45\nTable 2. Sleep/wake schemes\

    \ power is mostly dissipated in the RF components of WSNs than\nin data processing\
    \ units, such as microcontrollers and microprocessors [80]. A number of scholars\n\
    have applied various radio optimization schemes or techniques, including (i) transmission\
    \ power\ncontrol (TPC), (ii) modulation scheme, and (iii) cognitive radio, to\
    \ reduce the power consumption\nof the RF components of agriculture sensor nodes.\
    \ In the TPC scheme, the sensor nodes modify the\ntransmitted power to save energy,\
    \ stimulate avoiding interference, and establish a communication\nlink [81]. TPC\
    \ can be used in the agricultural ﬁeld [82,83], where the RF transmitted power\
    \ of the\nsensor nodes can be modiﬁed to reduce their power consumption based\
    \ on the measured distance\nbetween the sink node and the sensor nodes. Sahota\
    \ et al. [82] have investigated the application of\nTPC in reducing the power\
    \ consumption of the sensor nodes in precision agriculture-based WSNs.\nSeveral\
    \ power levels and different receiver sensitivity levels are considered to perform\
    \ the said process.\nThe network layers and MAC protocol in a WSN (based on CC1110)\
    \ for the agriculture domain are\nadopted to further lower the power consumption\
    \ of the sensor node. Results show that the power\nsaving that employs multiple\
    \ modes of transmitted power can be improved by approximately 10%\nrelative to\
    \ the traditional mode. By contrast, Kamarudin et al. [83] prolonged the lifetime\
    \ of the sensor\nnode by more than 8.5% by modifying the transmitted power of\
    \ the CC2420 communication device.\nA cognitive radio is an intelligent wireless\
    \ communication network [84] in which the wireless\ncommunication channel in the\
    \ spectrum band can be selected efﬁciently [85]. The transmission metrics\n(e.g.,\
    \ transmitted power, carrier frequency, and modulation scheme) can be adjusted\
    \ accordingly.\nA cognitive radio requires more energy than conventional devices\
    \ do because it includes sophisticated\nand complex functions [86]. Therefore,\
    \ an energy-efﬁcient cognitive radio network poses challenges,\nespecially with\
    \ regard to the use of battery energy. In wireless communication, the electromagnetic\n\
    spectrum is fully occupied, with several bands being partially used or unused.\
    \ This situation supports\nthe utilization of a cognitive radio, in which spectrum\
    \ holes can be utilized.\nSabri et al. [19] fused fuzzy logic control (FLC) with\
    \ a ZigBee wireless sensor actor network\n(WSAN), which can sense the surroundings\
    \ and respond in ideal performance without interference\nfrom agricultural crops.\
    \ FLC assists the specialists in managing complex systems more compared with\n\
    traditional control methods, which are ineffective in terms of ﬂexibility, energy,\
    \ productivity, and labor\ninterference. Two signiﬁcant greenhouse environment\
    \ parameters (i.e., humidity and temperature)\nare monitored during daytime and\
    \ nighttime. The results show that the intelligent technique-based\nFLC can signiﬁcantly\
    \ improve the WSAN lifespan. Therefore, the WSAN can work for 14 years with a\n\
    210 mAh battery power based on the FLC merged with WSAN.\nThe power consumption\
    \ of networks can be directly affected by the modulation scheme [87]. The\nmodulation\
    \ parameters can be adjusted to their optimal values to preserve the minimum power\n\
    consumption of radio modules. Anane et al. [88] investigated the Frequency-shift\
    \ keying (FSK) and\nMinimum-shift keying (MSK) modulation strategies to minimize\
    \ the total power consumption of\nthe sensor node required to transmit given data\
    \ packets. Through their extensive study, the authors\nconcluded that MSK outperforms\
    \ FSK in terms of power consumption. However, several modulation\nschemes cannot\
    \ be used in the ZigBee wireless protocol that operates at 2.4 GHz because this\
    \ protocol\nsupports a single modulation scheme. Speciﬁcally, the ZigBee wireless\
    \ protocol works with offset\nquadrature phase-shift keying (OQPSK) [89]. Table\

    \ Data Mitigation\nData mitigation presents another power consumption solution\
    \ for agriculture WSNs to reduce the\namount of data transmitted from source nodes\
    \ to destination nodes. Data mitigation can be achieved\nvia (i) data gathering,\
    \ (ii) data comparison, (iii) data rate, and (iv) data-driven techniques.\nData\
    \ gathering can extend the lifetime of sensor nodes in WSNs by minimizing redundant\
    \ data\ntransmission. In different applications of agriculture WSNs including\
    \ environment observation, the\nsensed data of the neighboring nodes may spatially\
    \ be associated. In this case, data combination\npresents an important method\
    \ for reducing the amount of redundant data, reducing the number\nof transmissions,\
    \ and minimizing the power consumption of the nodes in the network [90]. Data\n\
    gathering also reduces latency by minimizing data trafﬁc and improving the delay\
    \ between the sink\nand sensor nodes; after reducing the number of communications,\
    \ this approach can improve the\nexploitation of bandwidth [91]. Data merging\
    \ can be accomplished along a route starting from sensor\nnodes to sink nodes.\
    \ The nodes in a route can rebroadcast only the maximum, minimum, or average\n\
    amount of received data. The design of an energy-efﬁcient WSN-based data-gathering\
    \ scheme poses a\nsigniﬁcant challenge because this scheme must ensure a trade-off\
    \ among power consumption, latency,\nsecurity, data accuracy, and fault tolerance.\n\
    Gathering data in agricultural applications, including humidity, weather, temperature,\
    \ and soil\nmoisture, can minimize the power consumption of environment sensor\
    \ nodes by spatially correlating\nthe ﬁeld and redundant data of the sensor nodes\
    \ when the temperature does not change signiﬁcantly [1],\nespecially during nighttime.\
    \ For example, if the microcontroller of the temperature sensor node\nmeasures\
    \ the same temperature value for extended hours, then the sensor node sends the\
    \ temperature\nvalue every four hours to reduce power consumption. Merging the\
    \ temperature and humidity\nsensors into a single sensor may also reduce the power\
    \ consumption, size, and system complexity.\nAzaza et al. [17] integrated climate\
    \ condition parameters (i.e., temperature, CO2, humidity, and\nilluminance sensors)\
    \ inside a greenhouse and observed a comfortable growth of plants while saving\n\
    water resources and energy. The greenhouse was equipped with environment control\
    \ devices, such as\nventilation system, fogging system for humidiﬁcation, and\
    \ electrical heaters. A smart system based on\nfuzzy logic control correlated\
    \ humidity and temperature measurements is implemented to improve\nthe fogging\
    \ system operation. In that way, the power consumption of the fogging system can\
    \ be\nsigniﬁcantly reduced. In addition, the system was improved by a wireless\
    \ data observing platform\n(STM 32/F4 microcontroller and Virtex V FPGA board)\
    \ for logging and data routing, which provides\ndata access in real time. The\
    \ suggested control system based on fuzzy logic control was experimentally\nimplemented\
    \ and validated. The results revealed that the total energy and water usage decreased\
    \ by\n22% and 33%, respectively.\nMusaazi et al. [92] introduced a data caching\
    \ algorithm (DCAL) that optimizes the sleep/wake up\nperiods of ZigBee WSNs to\
    \ achieve low energy consumption and latency in PA application. In WSNs,\ndata\
    \ are collected from the source nodes and routed to the sink node; from the sink\
    \ node, the data\nare sent to the Internet. Reducing the transmission of duplicated\
    \ sensed data reduces the power\nconsumption. Energy conservation is paramount\
    \ during the communication phase to prolong the\nlifetime of sensor nodes. The\
    \ main method utilized to conserve energy involves switching off the nodes’\n\
    transceiver when they are not transmitting nor receiving packets. Additionally,\
    \ the data-gathering\nmethod for agriculture WSNs has been investigated in [93].\
    \ The proposed system includes ZigBee\nwireless sensor nodes, customized farming\
    \ personal digital assistants (PDAs), and a host PC. Each\nsensor node contains\
    \ four sensors to identify ﬁve agricultural ﬁeld parameters: soil temperature,\
    \ soil\nmoisture, environmental humidity, soil electrical conductivity, and environmental\
    \ temperature. The\nPDA combines the ZigBee coordinator node, GPRS module, and\
    \ GPS module. The ZigBee WSN\ngathers farming data and obtains GPS information\
    \ for each sensor node. It then passes the data to the\nhost PC through GPRS.\
    \ The experimental results show that the battery power of the sensor nodes can\n\
    be saved based on the data-gathering scheme.\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n16 of 45\n\
    Data compression is a useful method for deploying sensor nodes with restricted\
    \ energy resources.\nInformation encoding can be performed in sensor nodes, whereas\
    \ information decoding can be\nperformed in sink nodes. Using compression techniques\
    \ to reduce the size of information that the\nsink nodes transmit over wireless\
    \ channels may also reduce the power consumption and extend the\nbattery life\
    \ of the sensor nodes. One study has applied data compression approaches to reduce\
    \ the\npower consumption for auto-irrigation system which based on CC1000 RF module\
    \ [41]. Based on this\nmethod, the battery of the sensor node can be extended\
    \ to 359 days.\nThe data-driven power reduction technique aims to reduce the amount\
    \ of sampled data by\nconserving the sensing accuracy to an appropriate level\
    \ for a speciﬁed application [94]. Thereby,\nthe amount of data to be transmitted\
    \ to the sink nodes can be minimized. Therefore, this technique\ncan reduce the\
    \ power consumption of agriculture WSNs and extend their battery life. A data-driven\n\
    algorithm is considered by Lerdsuwan and Phunchongharn [95] to solve the energy\
    \ consumption\nproblem of the sensor node in PA with low complexity and maintain\
    \ the transmission rate. Their\nexperiment reveals that their proposed algorithm\
    \ has higher energy efﬁciency than the ESPIN and\nSPIN algorithms in [96,97] by\
    \ 36.84% and 81.53%, respectively.\nThe data rate of RF transceivers can be adjusted\
    \ in the physical layer of a wireless protocol to\nreduce the power consumption\
    \ of the sensor node. Davis et al. [98] investigated the low battery\ncondition\
    \ of a sensor node to attain prolonged battery life for separate wireless sensor\
    \ nodes that\ncan preserve sampling suitability and reliability in communicating\
    \ accurate data. Different sensors,\nsuch as those for soil moisture, sap ﬂow,\
    \ and soil water, were examined to study the effect of sensing\ndebility due to\
    \ low battery voltage. The comparison of the data sampling rate of these sensors\
    \ shows\nthat sap ﬂow measurement is the best option for agricultural WSN. This\
    \ ﬁnding is attributed to the\nlow error obtained when the sampling interval increased\
    \ to 15 min while maintaining measurement\naccuracy. Table 4 shows the comparison\
    \ of power reduction technique based on data mitigation schemes\nfor previous\

    \ power reduction scheme for agriculture WSNs to minimize\nthe path between sensor\
    \ nodes and sink node, thereby the power consumption of the WSN is reduced.\n\
    Routing protocol can be performed via (i) sink mobility, (ii) multi-path routing,\
    \ (iii) cluster architecture,\nand (iv) routing metric.\nSink mobility was adopted\
    \ in previous research [99,100]. Mathur et al. [99] proposed a novel\nmechanism\
    \ that adopts unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) to gather data from forest regions\
    \ instead\nof classical sensing from nodes deployed in WSN. The proposed method\
    \ enables the UAV to collect\ndata from WSN in harsh terrain and transmit it to\
    \ the base station situated far from the sensing area.\nTherefore, the multi-hop\
    \ transmission between cluster heads can be completely avoided, and the\ncommunication\
    \ range can be extended.\nMulti-path routing has also been suggested by other\
    \ scholars for agriculture WSNs [67,68,101].\nRecently, Nikolidakis et al. [67]\
    \ proposed an agricultural ﬁeld weather monitoring system based on\nthe ZigBee\
    \ wireless protocol. An advance energy-efﬁcient routing protocol was implemented\
    \ for WSN\nto automate irrigation management. The transmitter could modify its\
    \ power based on the distance\nbetween the sensor node and base station to save\
    \ energy. The results revealed that network lifetime\nincreased to 1825 min. Hedley\
    \ et al. [101] developed a WSN soil moisture mapping and monitoring\nmethod to\
    \ provide information for irrigation scheduling. To conserve power, the sensor\
    \ nodes relayed\ndata to the BS every 15 min through the greatest energy-efﬁcient\
    \ route.\nCluster head method is considered by Ndzi et al. [102] to extend the\
    \ ZigBee WSN lifetime for\nagricultural application.\nIn addition, the quality\
    \ of the crop yields is improved and their cost\nis minimized. The research presented\
    \ WSN coverage measurements in a mixed crop farmland.\nAn adaptive energy consumption\
    \ model for each sensor node was proposed and used to compute the\nenergy consumption\
    \ in the network. A deployment model with a cluster head and two antennas was\n\
    also proposed and simulated to alleviate short network lifetime due to the vegetation\
    \ attenuation of\nsignals. This network deployment model extended the lifetime\
    \ of the network by a factor of more than\n20 compared with a deployment where\
    \ cluster heads are not used. Nikolidakis et al. [103] proposed\na new routing\
    \ protocol for WSN that can reduce the power consumption of sensor nodes through\n\
    balanced clustering. This protocol was called “equalized cluster head election\
    \ routing protocol”\n(ECHERP). ECHERP was implemented in Java language for 500\
    \ homogeneous nodes distributed in a\n100 × 100 m2 land. The simulation results\
    \ showed that the proposed protocol outperforms existing\nprotocols in terms of\
    \ power consumption. A potential application of this protocol is PA.\nAnother\
    \ type of routing protocol is called routing metric. Chen et al. [104] used two\
    \ routing\nmetrics, namely, remained energy and expected transmission count, to\
    \ compute the optimal routing\npath to the sink node that ensures low power consumption.\
    \ “A scalable context-aware objective\nfunction (SCAOF)” is proposed by combining\
    \ robustness-aware, energy-aware, resource-aware, and\nreliability-aware contexts\
    \ that render to the compound routing metrics scheme. The experiment is\nconducted\
    \ in a garden based on a testbed, which includes a uIPv6 protocol stack and contiki\
    \ OS. The\nobtained results prove that SCAOF can convey the desired advantages\
    \ on network lifespan prolonging,\nas well as high efﬁciency and reliability in\
    \ different hardware testbeds and simulation scenarios.\nTable 5 shows the comparison\

    \ the power saving or battery lifetime,\ncommunication distance, and limitations\
    \ of WSNs in different agricultural applications in the work of\nseveral scholars\
    \ (Tables 2–6). The tables show that most previous studies used ZigBee wireless\
    \ protocol\nfor different agricultural applications. The use of ZigBee supports\
    \ our assumption that this wireless\nprotocol is suitable for agricultural monitoring\
    \ systems as discussed in Section 2. A combination of two\nor more power reduction\

    the power consumption of the WSN. Table 6 shows the comparison of power reduction\

    \ Techniques\nA major limitation of sensor nodes is their limited battery capacity.\
    \ Several energy-efﬁcient\nschemes have been introduced in previous research to\
    \ solve the power consumption problem of sensor\nnodes. An alternative method\
    \ that has been utilized to address the problem of limited node lifespan is\n\
    the use of energy-harvesting techniques. Numerous techniques have been developed\
    \ to allow sensor\nnodes to harvest different types of energy, such as solar,\
    \ wireless power transfer (WPT), mechanical\nvibration, kinetic, and wind energy,\
    \ from different environments [110] (Figure 2). Compared with\ntraditional sensor\
    \ nodes, rechargeable sensor nodes can work continuously for a long lifetime.\
    \ Ambient\nenergy can be converted to electrical energy and used directly to supply\
    \ the sensor nodes or can be\nstored and used later on. In agricultural applications,\
    \ energy harvesting can be used to prolong the\nlifetime of sensor nodes. Energy-harvesting\
    \ techniques for previous research works employed in\nprecision agriculture are\
    \ shown in Table 7. The said table lists the categories of energy-harvesting\n\
    techniques, types of wireless protocols, and output energy/power of energy-harvesting\
    \ techniques.\nIn addition, the form of agricultural applications, and limitations\
    \ of each article are also highlighted.\nEnergy-harvesting mechanisms can be implemented\
    \ with batteries for the sensor nodes. For\nexample, a sensor node using solar\
    \ energy to charge its batteries can work extensively during daytime\nwhen adequate\
    \ sunlight is available. Meanwhile, the sensor node can use its batteries through\
    \ power\nreduction techniques, such as sleep mode (i.e., duty cycle), at night\
    \ when sunlight is unavailable to save\nenergy. In addition, the sensor node can\
    \ enter restricted sleep periods (i.e., low duty cycle) and reduce\ntransmission\
    \ power when its batteries possess low residual energy [111]. Furthermore, adopting\
    \ a\nmaximum power point tracking system is a reliable battery charging technique\
    \ for long-term operation.\nThe charge–discharge cycle of the battery is minimized\
    \ [112].\n3.2.1. Solar Energy\nSolar energy based on photovoltaic system and methods\
    \ can be used in agricultural applications\nbased on WSNs [113]. Therefore, solar\
    \ cells provide a good solution [114] to ensure the survivability\nof the agriculture\
    \ monitoring system. Solar cell energy has been used by several studies to provide\n\
    long-term energy to sensor nodes in agriculture applications.\nGutiérrez et al.\
    \ [40] developed an irrigation system based on the ZigBee wireless protocol. The\n\
    system was developed to improve water usage for agricultural crops. Temperature\
    \ and soil moisture\nsensors in WSN were placed in the root of the plants to send\
    \ sensor information to a web application\nvia a gateway. The proposed algorithm\
    \ controls the water quantity based on threshold values of soil\nmoisture and\
    \ temperature that are programmed in a microcontroller-based gateway. The WSN\
    \ is\npowered by solar cell panels and rechargeable batteries. Water savings of\
    \ up to 90% were achieved\nrelative to the conventional irrigation method. Considering\
    \ that the system is cost effective and\nautonomous, it can be utilized in geographically\
    \ isolated regions where water sources are limited.\nZou et al. [68] improved\
    \ the battery lifetime of a WSN based on harvested energy (i.e., solar cell)\n\
    utilizing shadow detection. With this strategy, sensor nodes can accordingly modify\
    \ their scheduling\nto optimize their power production and remaining battery levels.\
    \ Furthermore, data transmission is\noptimized through routing and clustering\
    \ mechanisms. A Bayesian network was employed to provide\nwarning reports of bottlenecks\
    \ along the path. The system was deployed in real time based on the\nTexas Instruments\
    \ CC2530 platform that includes the ZigBee wireless protocol. The battery (lithium\n\
    type with a storage capacity of 2500 mAh) of the sensor node was charged from\
    \ the solar cell panel\nwhen the harvested power was adequate. The experimental\
    \ results showed that these techniques\nallow network activities to occur in a\
    \ continuous and effective manner.\nIn [115], a micro-irrigation system that relies\
    \ on a small solar-powered cell was developed. The\nenergy input, energy output,\
    \ greenhouse gas productions, and solar cell installation for rural areas\nwere\
    \ investigated with the proposed co-located system. The researchers compared their\
    \ system\nwith another commonly used method (i.e., aloe vera cultivation) in terms\
    \ of life cycle. The life cycle\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n23 of 45\nevaluation\
    \ showed that the proposed system is economical for several rural areas and may\
    \ provide\nopportunities for agriculture electriﬁcation and motivate economic\
    \ growth.\nRoblin [116] presented an irrigation system relying on a solar cell\
    \ for rural areas where sunlight is\noften available. The irrigation system includes\
    \ pumps working on a solar cell instead of an electricity\ngrid and/or a diesel\
    \ generator. The study showed that the irrigation system based on a solar cell\
    \ is\nbetter than systems that depend on other energy resources because the electricity\
    \ grid is unavailable at\nall times, and the operating cost of diesel pumps is\
    \ high and relies mainly on the diesel price. Although\nthe solar-powered system\
    \ was relatively expensive, it became a free source of energy after installation\n\
    in the rural area and proved to be a worthwhile investment in the long term. A\
    \ similar irrigation\nsystem was proposed in [117]. The system adopts photovoltaic\
    \ panels to power a water pump that\nconverts the continuous drift of water into\
    \ a drop drift to achieve increased water usage efﬁciency.\nKwon et al. [118]\
    \ suggested a novel prediction technique for energy harvesting with a solar\n\
    cell within three hours. Moreover, the packet transmissions of the sensor nodes\
    \ can be controlled\ndepending on the estimated energy. Packet transmissions and\
    \ energy harvesting are integrated to\nimprove the WSN performance. The integration\
    \ of these schemes enhances the prediction accuracy\nand improves the WSN throughput\
    \ and power consumption. The throughput of the sensor node can\nbe increased by\
    \ shortening the packet transmission period. By contrast, when the packet transmission\n\
    period increases, the power consumption of the sensor node decreases. The experimental\
    \ results show\nthat the proposed packet transmission scheme is superior to the\
    \ others in terms of data throughput\nand deadline miss rate. The proposed energy-harvesting\
    \ method is also predicted more precisely than\nothers by 6.92%.\nA study [119]\
    \ used a solar cell to provide energy to a WSN deployed in a greenhouse. The\n\
    humidity and temperature of the greenhouse were controlled through a management\
    \ and monitoring\nsystem, which was based on a low-power MSP430 (Texas Instruments,\
    \ Dallas, TX, USA) microcontroller\nand an ultra-low-power nRF24L01 transceiver\
    \ (Nordic Semiconductor, Oslo, Norway). The power\nconsumption of the WSN was\
    \ minimized as much as possible. In another study, a WSN-based ZigBee\n(CC2420\
    \ module) wireless transceiver and microcontroller (low-power ATmega128L) supplied\
    \ by\nthe solar cell as a battery charger were considered to monitor the humidity,\
    \ temperature, rain level,\nand leaf wetness of vineyards [120]. The WSN covered\
    \ 30 m between ZigBee units with a low power\nconsumption (35 and 38 mW in transmission\
    \ and reception modes, respectively).\n3.2.2. Wireless Power Transfer\nRecent\
    \ developments in wireless power transfer (WPT) are expected to increase the lifetime\n\
    of WSNs signiﬁcantly and make them continuously operational, given that WPT techniques\
    \ can\nbe utilized to transmit electromagnetic energy between transmitter and\
    \ receiver devices without\nany contact between the two. WPT is expected to overcome\
    \ the constraint of the supply of WSNs.\nConsequently, some researchers highlighted\
    \ the utilization of mobile node that can deliver power\nto deployed sensor nodes\
    \ such as [121,122].\nWPT technology poses a challenge to the energy\ncooperation\
    \ between neighboring nodes in WSNs. Therefore, in the future, sensor nodes could\n\
    harvest energy from the environment and transfer this energy to other nodes in\
    \ the network; in this\nmanner, a self-sustaining network can be achieved [123].\
    \ Accordingly, recent research has investigated\nmulti-hop energy transfer [124,125],\
    \ which paved the way for new energy cooperative schemes and\nWPT charging protocols.\n\
    WPT can be classiﬁed into three main subcategories:\n(i) electromagnetic (EM)\
    \ radiation,\n(ii) magnetic resonator coupling, and (iii) inductive coupling,\
    \ as shown in Figure 2. Wireless charging\nin WSNs can be performed via EM radiation\
    \ and magnetic resonant coupling. EM signals suffer from\nattenuation over distance,\
    \ and active radiation may pose a threat to the human body. Meanwhile,\nmagnetic\
    \ resonant coupling can address the power requirements of agriculture based on\
    \ WSNs because\nof its efﬁciency within a distance of several meters. Many studies\
    \ used WPT to charge sensor nodes\nfor different applications and ﬁelds. WPT-based\
    \ inductive coupling [121] has been used to charge\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n24\
    \ of 45\nthe battery of sensor nodes scattered in agriculture ﬁelds. The energy\
    \ is transferred from the source\ncoil (mounted on a UAV) to the receiver coil\
    \ (attached with sensor nodes). A 2.4 W transfer power\nis transferred to charge\
    \ a single sensor node. The results addressed a number of limitations and\nchallenges\
    \ related to the charging of sensor nodes via a UAV. In addition, the results\
    \ revealed that\nthe battery lifetime of the deployed sensors can be signiﬁcantly\
    \ extended through the UAV. A similar\napproach was adopted by Chen et al. [122]\
    \ to charge a WSN in an agricultural ﬁeld through the\nharvesting of electromagnetic\
    \ radiation.\n3.2.3. Air Flow Energy\nHarnessing wind energy is another energy-harvesting\
    \ technique that can be utilized to provide\npower to sensor nodes in agricultural\
    \ applications. An adaptive routing protocol, wind energy\nharvesting, and sleep\
    \ scheduling were considered in [126] to minimize the power consumption of the\n\
    ZigBee transceiver and extend the lifetime of the WSN.\n3.2.4. Vibration Energy\n\
    Vibration energy based on piezoelectric can be used to charge the battery of sensor\
    \ nodes to prolong\ntheir lifetime. Müller et al. [127] have been analyzed various\
    \ WSN protocols based on ZigBee (CC2420\nand CC2500) and CC1100 with respect to\
    \ their applicability in the agricultural setting. Furthermore,\na fully synchronous\
    \ protocol with a time-slot architecture for a WSN has been proposed for agricultural\n\
    machinery to achieve real-time capability, low latency, and deterministic behavior.\
    \ The objective of\ntheir application was to monitor the back door position and\
    \ ﬁlling level of a forage wagon using a\nZigBee (CC2420) RF transceiver. Clock\
    \ synchronization among all nodes is implemented to ensure\nstrict power on/sleep\
    \ times of each sensor node. Meanwhile, an energy-harvesting unit based on a\n\
    piezoelectric material has been designed; the unit provides an average power of\
    \ 200 µW to sensor\nnodes. In this case, the sensor node can transmit a data payload\
    \ of nine bytes in 40 ms.\n3.2.5. Water Flow Energy\nMulti-energy sources (water,\
    \ wind, and solar) platform is designed for precision agricultural\napplications\
    \ by Morais et al. [128]. The authors explored water ﬂow, wind speed and solar\
    \ radiation\nfeasible energy sources to encounter the requirements of ZigBee router\
    \ node in WSN. Thus, several\npowered solutions for WSN is presented. Design considerations\
    \ regarding water ﬂow energy, the water\nﬂow in the pipes of crops irrigation\
    \ system are employed to generate the energy for ZigBee router node.\nThis idea\
    \ can be applied in different agricultural applications such as greenhouses, aquaculture,\
    \ and\nhydroponic systems, where the water recirculation in pipes is continuous.\
    \ Like to bulky hydroelectric\ngeneration utilities, a water ﬂow in the pipes,\
    \ derived from the main water source, can be employed\nto run a turbine joined\
    \ to a small direct current (DC) generator. The experimental results revealed\n\
    that the three energy sources combined together can generate an energy of 58 mAh,\
    \ more than the\nrequirement of the ZigBee router node (39 mAh).\n3.2.6. Microbial\
    \ Fuel Cell Energy\nAnother type of energy harvesting technique is called microbial\
    \ fuel cell. This technique is extracted\nfrom energy neutral system. Sartori\
    \ and Brunelli [129] proposed microbial fuel cell to supply the\nunderground freshwater\
    \ system that used for monitoring the water level in the phreatic zone, artesian\n\
    wells, and tanks. The proposed system comprises a low-cost phreatimeter sensor,\
    \ a low-power\nmicrocontroller (i.e., MSP430FR5739), and a low-power LoRa wireless\
    \ protocol. However, the amount\nof microbial fuel cell energy extraction of 296\
    \ µW is not enough to supply LoRa wireless protocol and\nmicrocontroller directly\
    \ when they are in active mode. Therefore, a DC-to-DC boost is employed to\nraise\
    \ the small input voltages of 130 mV to 4.5 V.\nEvidently, most agricultural applications\
    \ prefer to use solar cells as battery chargers of WSNs\nbecause these cells are\
    \ easy to install, work efﬁciently when sunlight is available, and supply more\n\
    Sensors 2017, 17, 1781\n25 of 45\nenergy compared with other energy-harvesting\
    \ techniques as shown in Table 7. In addition, the table\nshows most of the previous\
    \ scholars adopted ZigBee wireless protocol. Clearly, employing ZigBee\nsupports\
    \ our study that this wireless protocol is more suitable for agricultural monitoring\
    \ systems.\nSolar panels can supply 100 mW/cm2, whereas radio frequency, thermal,\
    \ vibration, wind, microbial\nfuel cell, magnetic resonant coupling WPT, and water\
    \ ﬂow can supply 0.001, 0.06, 0.8, 1.0, 0.296, 14, and\n19 mWs, respectively [128–131].\
    \ For example, as shown in Figure 3 (Part A), if the power consumption\nof the\
    \ WSN components presented in [120] is 35 mW for ZigBee (Chipcon CC2420), 0.27\
    \ mW for\nthe temperature sensor, 3 mW for the humidity sensor, 0.27 mW for the\
    \ rain gauge sensor, 5 mW\nfor the leaf wetness sensor, and 24 mW for the ATmega128L\
    \ microcontroller [132], a single solar cell\n(2 × 2 cm2) panel can adequate supply\
    \ this WSN. However, when the power consumption of the WSN\nincreases, the dimension\
    \ of the solar cell panel also needs to be increased.\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n\

    \ the visibility of a group of systems, technologies, platforms, and design \n\
    principles for joining things, depending on the physical surroundings, through\
    \ the use of the Internet. \nPA is an application that can employ the benefits\
    \ of IoT to increase production efficiency, improve \nthe quality of yields, reduce\
    \ the negative ecological impact, prevent the prevalence of plant-eating \npests\
    \ or plant diseases, alert farmers about farm fires [141], and increase the profitability\
    \ of several \nagricultural production schemes. Agriculture involves farming,\
    \ planting, and animal rearing, and it \nhas grown under the scope of IoT recently\
    \ [5]. Tracking of animals, monitoring of farms, and \nirrigation processes are\
    \ the main domains of IoT for cultivation [142]. Furthermore, feeding, rearing,\
    \ \nmedication, and vaccination are essential applications of IoT in the agricultural\
    \ domain [143]. \nConsequently, several IoT modular architectures have been proposed\
    \ and implemented by scholars \nfor PA monitoring (as presented in Table 8). Real-time\
    \ ecological information can be remotely \ngathered from the agricultural surroundings\
    \ based on different sensors, which transmit the \ninformation to be processed\
    \ to determine problems, take required actions using actuators, or store \ndata.\
    \ \nSensors in WSN can be employed to gather information about environmental and\
    \ physical \nfeatures, whereas actuators are used to respond to the feedback to\
    \ control or to perform an action \nover the conditions (Figure 3, Part B). The\
    \ use of sensors in agricultural applications poses a number \nof requirements,\
    \ including gathering of soil, weather, and crop information; surveillance of\
    \ \nagricultural areas, water and fertilizer requirements of diverse pieces of\
    \ rough land, several crops on \na single piece of acreage, different requirements\
    \ of crops for unlike soil and weather circumstances, \nand eliminating of interactive\
    \ solutions and relying on proactive solutions. All these requirements \nare applied\
    \ and processed in parallel. Therefore, different sensors and actuators must be\
    \ used to \nhandle this information and respond to different conditions. Processed\
    \ information can be utilized \nto make a decision instead of raw data of the\
    \ sensor [132]. This information can be transmuted to the \ncloud computing via\
    \ gateway for data processing and data storage, as shown in Figure 3 (Part C).\
    \ \nReference [144] proposed a modular architecture for a wireless sensor node\
    \ implemented for PA \napplications. The sensors employed in this modular were\
    \ soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and \nwind direction and speed sensors\
    \ to monitor the agricultural environments. “Adafruit Pro Trinket” \nplatform\
    \ was selected for the data processing, and nRF wireless protocol was used as\
    \ a transceiver \nto transfer sensor data to the gateway (i.e., Intel Edison to\
    \ reduce the power consumption). The \ngateway was in charge of collected information\
    \ from different sensors and passed the information to \nFigure 3. Example of\

    \ the data processing, and nRF wireless protocol was used as a transceiver to\n\
    transfer sensor data to the gateway (i.e., Intel Edison to reduce the power consumption).\
    \ The gateway\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n29 of 45\nwas in charge of collected information\
    \ from different sensors and passed the information to the cloud\nserver. The\
    \ proposed system resulted in improved crop quality and minimized negative ecological\n\
    effect. In [145], the usage of water in smart irrigation systems was controlled\
    \ based on developed IoT\nplatforms. A cloud agriculture ﬁeld-monitoring scheme\
    \ was designed and implemented to enable\nthe farmer to monitor the soil condition.\
    \ Soil moisture and weather temperature were monitored to\nautomate the irrigation\
    \ system in farm while minimizing water consumption, which led to reduced\ncost\
    \ and maintained environmental beneﬁts. The proposed water irrigation system included\
    \ three\nmain parts: a WSN and actuator, a cloud platform, and user application.\
    \ The WSN and actuator part\nconsisted of sensor nodes for collecting the soil\
    \ moisture and weather temperature, an actuator node\nto control the irrigation\
    \ process, and a sink node that could pass all farm information to the cloud\n\
    platform. All sensor, sink, and actuator nodes adopted low-power ZigBee wireless\
    \ protocol.\nWSN and 3G network-based agriculture IoT was considered in [146]\
    \ to monitor the air\ntemperature, air humidity, and soil moisture. The entire\
    \ system consisted of sensor nodes, actuators\nsink nodes, server, gateway, and\
    \ the mobile phone device of the farmer. The collected information by\nthe sensor\
    \ nodes was sent to the server via gateway and Internet network. The gateway connected\
    \ the\nWSN with the Internet to relay the command control among the sensor nodes,\
    \ the phone of the farmer,\nthe actuators, and the server. However, in this system,\
    \ the data transmission over the 3G network\nmust ensure real-time communications\
    \ to support the agricultural WSN.\nIoT-based agriculture applications changed\
    \ classical agricultural surveillance approaches by\nspeedily providing quantitative\
    \ data with signiﬁcant temporal and spatial resolution. Several IoT\nplatforms\
    \ have recently been available in the market. For instance, in agricultural applications,\n\
    SmartFarmNet [147] platforms can be used to provide more than 30 packages for\
    \ good commercial\nproducts, such as Libelium [45], and experimental, such as\
    \ Motes [148] and Arduino [149] sensor\nplatforms. Other examples of agricultural\
    \ applications based on IoT are provided in Table 8. The table\npresents a comparative\
    \ analysis of several scholars in terms of sensors, actuators, IoT devices, and\
    \ IoT\nplatforms that can be used to support agricultural applications.\nSensors\

    \ of PA domain such as sensors, microcontrollers, and wireless technologies\n\
    are highlighted and classiﬁed in Table 9. For better clariﬁcation, the sensors\
    \ are classiﬁed into three\nmain categories leaf wetness/plant, soil moisture,\
    \ and environment sensors [5,132]. These sensors can\nbe utilized in several potential\
    \ agriculture applications. In Table 9, the microcontroller/processor and\nwireless\
    \ protocols are also highlighted. Among the microcontrollers, the majority of\
    \ agriculture sensor\nnodes adopting ATmega128L because this microcontroller supports\
    \ data aggregation, decision making,\nstorage capability, ﬂash memory, low complexity,\
    \ and energy management through multi-levels of\npower down modes [132]. ZigBee\
    \ and LoRa wireless protocols/technologies are widely used in several\nagricultural\
    \ applications, as discussed previously in Section 2.\nIn precision agriculture,\
    \ to obtain high-quality products, the environmental parameters should be\ncontrolled\
    \ to provide optimal values. For example, the temperature rate that has a positive\
    \ effect on the\ngrowth of the pepper ﬁeld is between 20 and 25 ◦C. The temperature\
    \ in rainy, sunny, and nightly days\nshould be kept between 20 and 22 ◦C, between\
    \ 25 and 28 ◦C, and between 18 and 20 ◦C, respectively\nand the minimum value\
    \ should be not lower than 16–17 ◦C. Air humidity for pepper vegetables should\n\
    be kept between 60% and 70%. The high-temperature value combines with low humidity\
    \ value may\nbe caused a negative inﬂuence on the growth of the pepper. The maximum\
    \ humidity value in pepper\ngreenhouse should be not above 70%. Soil pH (i.e.,\
    \ soil acidity) is another factor that directly effects\non the pepper crops,\
    \ where it can measure the quantity of calcium in the soil. The soil for pepper\n\
    crops can be acid or alkaline depending on the weather conditions. It should be\
    \ acid for wet climate\nand alkaline for a dry climate. Soil with pH levels above\
    \ 7.0 is considered alkaline, while soil with\npH levels below 7.0 has acid nature.\
    \ Soil pH values must be controlled according to the type of the\nagricultural\
    \ yield. For pepper crop, the best values for pH gauge are between 6.5 and 5.5.\
    \ Therefore,\nthe humidity, temperature, and soil pH should be constantly supervised\
    \ in order to identify the right\ntime for draining and watering the agricultural\
    \ crops.\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n33 of 45\nTable 9. Types of sensors, microcontrollers,\

    \ Limitations\nThe development of WSNs prompted new research trends in the agricultural\
    \ domain. Micro\nelectromechanical system (MEMS) technologies allow for the manufacture\
    \ of cheap and small sensors.\nThe pervasive nature of the process, together with\
    \ tiny, self-regulating sensor nodes, cost-effective\nequipment, and scalability,\
    \ indicate that WSNs can be used for agriculture automation [5]. However,\nregarding\
    \ the distribution of WSNs to observe different agricultural climates, a number\
    \ of open\nchallenges and limitations remain. Several of these challenges and\
    \ limitations in existing agricultural\napplications based on WSNs are listed\
    \ below together with suggestions on how to address them.\n(1)\nPower consumption\
    \ and battery life:\nA WSN consists of three main components:\nsensors,\nmicrocontrollers,\
    \ and RF transceivers. Given that the battery of a sensor node provides limited\n\
    energy, ensuring that the components of the sensor node consume minimum power\
    \ is crucial.\nIn particular, reducing the power consumption of the RF transceiver,\
    \ which consumes more power\nthan the other components in a sensor node, would\
    \ alleviate this problem [67,127]. Moreover,\nthis issue can be addressed in two\
    \ steps. The ﬁrst is to propose an intelligent energy-efﬁcient\nalgorithm. The\
    \ second step can be performed by utilizing available energy-harvesting techniques,\n\
    such as solar cells, vibration, and WPT.\n(2)\nCommunication range: WSNs suffer\
    \ from the effect of harsh ecological conditions because of the\nwide range of\
    \ open agricultural surroundings [5]. The WSN protocol contains mechanisms to\n\
    resist the effect of data transmission failures in the network, which increase\
    \ due to ecological\neffects. In agricultural applications, most wireless sensor\
    \ technologies support a relatively short\ncommunication range. Therefore, many\
    \ sensor and router nodes need to be diffused in a WSN.\nIn the point-to-point\
    \ Zigbee network, the communication distance can reach 100 m in outdoor\nenvironments.\
    \ The ZigBee communication range can be extended by adopting multi-tire, ad-hoc,\n\
    decentralized, and mesh network topologies. Drones or UAV also can be used as\
    \ a mobile router\nnode to extend the communication range within a farm ﬁeld.\
    \ A drone could pass the collected\ndata from the sensor nodes to the master node\
    \ through multi-hop. However, using drones entails\nother challenges and limitations.\n\
    (3)\nPropagation losses:\nIn agricultural applications, WSNs must be able to work\
    \ in diverse\nsurroundings, such as ground, bare land, orchards, greenhouses,\
    \ farms, and complex topography;\nthey must also be able to operate in all climate\
    \ conditions. All these conditions inﬂuence the\nperformance of radio propagation.\
    \ Whether the topography is simple or complicated, the\ncommunication possibility\
    \ between the points in a WSN still suffers from serious challenges.\nThe signal\
    \ transmitted from the sensor nodes in agricultural applications need to pass\
    \ through a\nheavy crop canopy to arrive to at the receiver nodes, which cannot\
    \ ensure a sufﬁcient clearance\narea and will cause signal propagation absorption,\
    \ reﬂection, attenuation, and scattering. In\nthis case, the link quality is degraded,\
    \ especially when the signal spreads through dense crops.\nTherefore, when deploying\
    \ WSNs, communication link quality and temporal and spatial variables\nmust be\
    \ guaranteed. The communication performance of WSNs is related to the working\n\
    surroundings. Therefore, due to the limited resources and power budget of WSNs,\
    \ an accurate\nwireless channel path loss model must be adopted to reﬂect the\
    \ propagation features. This model\nis expected to demonstrate correct optimization\
    \ and network evaluation performance throughout\nthe deployment design process\
    \ to develop the energy efﬁciency of the nodes [15], improve the\ntarget detection\
    \ and localization applications [16], decrease the number of retransmission, and\n\
    ensure Quality of Service (QoS) of the network [175].\n(4)\nRouting: Different\
    \ problems can emerge due to packet collision and limited bandwidth, which\nare\
    \ introduced by channel propagation, and so on. Therefore, when a WSN is deployed\
    \ in a wide\narea in farm ﬁelds, multi-hop is required. Kim et al. [3] developed\
    \ an independent mobile robot\nplatform based on a mobility task for surveillance\
    \ to overcome channel interference.\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n35 of 45\n(5)\nLocalization\
    \ and tracking: Tracking and localization of a herd of cattle are considered smart\
    \ farm\napplications based on WSNs. For example, a WSN can be employed to track\
    \ and localize of dairy\ncows to enable herd management. ZigBee wireless protocol\
    \ is used to monitor animal locations\nand behaviors, such as walking and standing,\
    \ lying down, and grazing [16,18]. In this context,\nseveral considerations, such\
    \ as radio interference, animal situation, and mobility, changes in\nWSN topology,\
    \ penetration depth of the signal through the animal body, height of the collar,\
    \ and\naccess point antennas, need to be taken into account [176]. These considerations\
    \ pose challenges\nin the localization and tracking of the animals.\n(6)\nReliability:\
    \ Agricultural monitoring systems based on different environmental sensors can\
    \ also\nbe used to monitor pollution aside from climate conditions. Important\
    \ information on climate\nconditions is reported to related agencies and farmers\
    \ from a remote location for advance\ninvestigations. Dangerous information needs\
    \ to be dealt with immediately in an emergency,\nwhich means that data transmission\
    \ in WSNs should demonstrate high reliability [3].\n(7)\nScalability: In agricultural\
    \ applications, the construction of WSN-based fault-tolerant and\nrobust hierarchical\
    \ architectures requires large-scale deployment relative to single-level network\n\
    architectures.\nA hierarchical architecture can be scaled up for developing applications\
    \ by\nduplicating to several ﬁelds. In this context, to increase the number of\
    \ WSNs over a vast area,\nmultiple wireless router nodes are placed in an agricultural\
    \ ﬁeld to guarantee sustained operation.\n(8)\nCost: The total hardware and software\
    \ costs of sensor nodes are important. The design of sensor\nnodes for any agricultural\
    \ application level must involve a low cost while demonstrating a robust\nperformance;\
    \ moreover, the design needs to be available for use by poor country markets [5].\n\
    This challenge can be overcome by reducing software and hardware costs further.\n\
    (9)\nReal time: Most crops are vulnerable to climate conditions, such as humidity,\
    \ intensity of\nillumination, and temperature. This vulnerability is a burden\
    \ to farmers who monitor changes\nin climate conditions hourly and/or daily because\
    \ doing so is labor-intensive. Moreover, in\ngreenhouses, a ﬁre can occur and\
    \ lead to severe agricultural disasters. This evidence suggests\nthat the monitoring\
    \ of the ecological conditions of agricultural WSNs needs to be in real time.\n\
    Real-time monitoring will enhance yield production and plant growth and avoid\
    \ dangerous\ndisasters in farms [3].\n(10) Storage and recording of data: Large\
    \ amounts of data are recorded from agriculture observing\nsystems because several\
    \ WSNs in agricultural applications contain several sensors for crop\ngrowth analysis\
    \ and harvesting estimation. This condition requires the base station to monitor\n\
    changes in farm ﬁelds by analyzing patterns. The base station must thus be supported\
    \ by a high\nstorage capacity.\n(11) Security: Security and protection are important\
    \ issues in agricultural products. Protection\nfrom insects or attacks of rodents\
    \ in grain stores or ﬁelds is essential. Such a challenge must\nbe considered\
    \ to maintain the security level of agriculture. Protection and security can be\n\
    achieved based on real-time analysis and processing of agricultural information\
    \ without human\nintrusion [159].\n(12) Delay tolerance: Critical delay poses\
    \ a challenge to agricultural applications. Some agricultural\napplications can\
    \ be considered as time sensitive, such as those used in farm ﬁre detection,\n\
    detection of exposure of crops to pests, cow heat event detection during milking,\
    \ and exposure of\ncattle to heat for a certain period. Such information must\
    \ be transmitted as fast as possible if the\ncritical issue is to be handled.\
    \ In such a case, a tradeoff between energy consumption and data\ntimelines is\
    \ necessary. By contrast, some agricultural applications are delay tolerant (i.e.,\
    \ time\ninsensitive), such as protein content, milk fat [177], gathering data\
    \ from soil and grass monitoring.\nWith delay tolerant approach, the short range\
    \ low power wireless protocols can be used [178].\nWhere the information of the\
    \ agricultural ﬁeld can be collected and transferred to the master\nnode or to\
    \ a cloud computing node using “messengers” e.g., a mobile node (mobile robot\
    \ or\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n36 of 45\nUAV). Consequently, the cost [179] and\
    \ the complexity of the agriculture WSN will be reduced\nand the lifetime will\
    \ be increased.\n(13) Fault tolerance: Fault tolerance is a crucial feature of\
    \ WSNs for succeeding PA. Several faults may\noccur in PA based on the WSN system,\
    \ which are (i) communication failure, (ii) faulty sensor\nsetting, (iii) sensor\
    \ component faults producing incorrect value, and (iv) node failure because of\n\
    exhausted battery or any other cause. Gutiérrez et al. [40] introduced communication\
    \ failure and\nnode fault tolerance for an irrigation system. If any fault occurs,\
    \ the irrigation system tracks the\ndefault irrigation program. The node energy\
    \ depletion failure was minimized in [1,40,180] by\nadopting solar-cell-powered\
    \ nodes. Data aggregation and topology control schemes are probable\nto be fault\
    \ tolerant for deploying sensor nodes in a vast area.\n(14) Data management: The\
    \ data management in agriculture poses a challenge because the large\namount of\
    \ data that can be collected from several sensors spread in agricultural ﬁeld,\
    \ especially\nwhen the agricultural data are intended to be connected to the cloud.\
    \ Determination of the\n(i) data analysis method, (ii) data collection schemes,\
    \ (iii) sensor types, (iv) semantic sensor\nnetworking, (v) big data, and (vi)\
    \ complex event processing enables the designer to manage\nthese crucial aspects.\
    \ The integration of IoT and software-deﬁned network also introduces a\npromising\
    \ and new methodology in deployment, monitoring, and design of network services\n\
    and resources [181].\n(15) Heterogeneous sensors: Integration of wired and wireless\
    \ heterogeneous sensors into information\nplatforms to perform interoperability\
    \ pose challenges in PA. Chen et al. [152] proposed “web\nservice-enabled cyber-physical\
    \ infrastructure” to solve this issue. The proposed system was able\nto integrate,\
    \ process, acquire, and distribute surveillance data from different physical sensors\n\
    spread in the PA system over the Internet. The infrastructure was executed to\
    \ serve as an\narchitecture middleware between PA clients and heterogeneous sensors.\n\
    6. Conclusions\nA review of WSN-based agricultural applications was presented.\
    \ A comparison was conducted\namong different wireless technologies or protocols,\
    \ such as WiFi, Bluetooth, ZigBee, GPRS/3G/4G,\nLoRa, and SigFox. The comparison\
    \ results revealed that the ZigBee and LoRa wireless protocols are\nmore convenient\
    \ for agricultural applications than the others because of its low power consumption\n\
    and suitable communication range for ZigBee and long for LoRa. A classiﬁcation\
    \ of energy-efﬁcient\ntechniques or algorithms and energy-harvesting techniques\
    \ was also provided. Based on the presented\ntaxonomy, we show that signiﬁcant\
    \ types of energy-efﬁcient and energy-harvesting techniques\ncan be used in the\
    \ agriculture domain. Previous research was also investigated and compared\nto\
    \ explore the current problems in agricultural applications based on WSNs and\
    \ obtain optimum\nsolutions for maintaining system performance. Challenges and\
    \ limitations were introduced for\ndesign considerations in the future. The state-of-the-art\
    \ approaches of IoT in agricultural applications\nwere reviewed and compared to\
    \ explore various sensors, actuators, devices, IoT platforms, and\napplication\
    \ layers.\nAcknowledgments: The authors would like to thank Al-Raﬁdain University\

    \ of Things (IoT)-based automation of agricultural events can change the agriculture\n\
    sector from being static and manual to dynamic and smart, leading to enhanced\
    \ production with\nreduced human efforts. Precision Agriculture (PA) along with\
    \ Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) are the\nmain drivers of automation in the agriculture\
    \ domain. PA uses speciﬁc sensors and software to ensure\nthat the crops receive\
    \ exactly what they need to optimize productivity and sustainability. PA includes\n\
    retrieving real data about the conditions of soil, crops and weather from the\
    \ sensors deployed in the\nﬁelds. High-resolution images of crops are obtained\
    \ from satellite or air-borne platforms (manned\nor unmanned), which are further\
    \ processed to extract information used to provide future decisions.\nIn this\
    \ paper, a review of near and remote sensor networks in the agriculture domain\
    \ is presented\nalong with several considerations and challenges. This survey\
    \ includes wireless communication\ntechnologies, sensors, and wireless nodes used\
    \ to assess the environmental behaviour, the platforms\nused to obtain spectral\
    \ images of crops, the common vegetation indices used to analyse spectral\nimages\
    \ and applications of WSN in agriculture. As a proof of concept, we present a\
    \ case study\nshowing how WSN-based PA system can be implemented. We propose an\
    \ IoT-based smart solution\nfor crop health monitoring, which is comprised of\
    \ two modules. The ﬁrst module is a wireless sensor\nnetwork-based system to monitor\
    \ real-time crop health status. The second module uses a low altitude\nremote\
    \ sensing platform to obtain multi-spectral imagery, which is further processed\
    \ to classify\nhealthy and unhealthy crops. We also highlight the results obtained\
    \ using a case study and list the\nchallenges and future directions based on our\
    \ work.\nKeywords: smart agriculture; precision agriculture; vegetation index;\
    \ Internet of Things\n1. Introduction\nThe rapidly-growing human population has\
    \ increased food demands for human survival on\nthe Earth. Meeting the food requirements\
    \ with limited resources of the planet is a big challenge [1].\nSeveral state-of-the-art\
    \ technologies are being incorporated in the agriculture domain to enhance\nthe\
    \ productivity to cope with this challenge. Precision Agriculture (PA) is comprised\
    \ of near and\nremote sensing techniques using IoT sensors, which help to monitor\
    \ crop states at multiple growth\nlevels. PA involves the acquisition and processing\
    \ of a large amount of data related to crop health.\nMultiple parameters are involved\
    \ in plants health, including water level, temperature and others.\nPA enables\
    \ a farmer to know precisely what parameters are needed for healthy crop, where\
    \ these\nparameters are needed and in what amount at a particular instance of\
    \ time. This requires collecting\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796; doi:10.3390/s19173796\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n2 of 25\nmassive information\
    \ from different sources and different parts of the ﬁeld such as soil nutrients,\
    \ the\npresence of pests and weeds, chlorophyll content in plants and some weather\
    \ conditions. All collected\ninformation needs to be analysed to produce agronomic\
    \ recommendations. For instance, given the\ndevelopmental stage of plants, their\
    \ level of greenness (chlorophyll content) reveals the nutrients\nneeded. This\
    \ information is combined with the characteristics of the soil where the plant\
    \ is located\nalong with weather forecast. All collected information is further\
    \ used to determine how much of a\ncertain fertilizer should be applied to that\
    \ plant on the next day. The delivery of agronomic information\non the right time\
    \ to farmer and ensuring that he/she applies these recommendations are key to\n\
    enhancing the yields.\nThe foremost driver of PA is a WSN, which is a network\
    \ of multiple wireless nodes connected\ntogether to monitor the physical parameters\
    \ of environment. Each wireless node is comprised of a\nradio transceiver, a micro-controller,\
    \ sensor(s), an antenna, along with other circuitry that enables it\nto communicate\
    \ with some gateway to transmit information collected by the sensor(s) [2]. Sensors\n\
    measure the physical parameters and send the collected information to the controller,\
    \ which further\ntransmits this information to the cloud or a portable device.\
    \ The agriculture sector has multiple\nrequirements comprised of soil statistics,\
    \ crops’ nature, weather conditions, fertilizer types and water\nrequirements.\
    \ Crops have diverse requirements depending on different crops on the same land\
    \ and the\nsame plant on different lands with different weather conditions. Sensors\
    \ monitor the varying behaviour\nof these crop parameters. Due to rapid advancement\
    \ in WSN technologies, the size and the cost of\nsensors have reduced, which make\
    \ it feasible to implement them in many sectors of life including\nagriculture.\
    \ The most common sensors used in the agriculture domain that capture environmental\n\
    parameters related to crops [3] are listed in Table 1.\nIn general, a WSN consists\
    \ of one or more wireless nodes that are further connected with sensors.\nThese\
    \ nodes are tiny devices that are responsible for collecting data. Nodes are divided\
    \ into two types,\na source node that collects the data, and the other is sink\
    \ or gateway node, which receives data from the\nsource nodes. A sink node has\
    \ more computational power compared to a source node. However, there\nare energy,\
    \ memory, power, size, data rate and price constraints when choosing wireless\
    \ nodes. Table 2\nshows a comparison of wireless nodes along with their common\
    \ speciﬁcations [3]. Among all wireless\nnodes presented in Table 2, MICA2 is\
    \ considered to be more suitable as compared to others because of\nits large number\
    \ of expansion connectors, which makes it suitable to connect with several sensors.\n\
    Many applications using WSN have been proposed since the last decade to monitor\
    \ crops’ health\nremotely. In [4], a cyber-physical system was presented for monitoring\
    \ of a potato crop. Cyber physical\nsystems can be expressed as smart systems\
    \ that are comprised of software, hardware and physical\ncomponents, integrated\
    \ together to sense the varying states of the real world. The proposed system\n\
    consists of three layers: the ﬁrst layer is the physical layer, in which all sensory\
    \ data are collected;\nthe second layer is the network layer in which data are\
    \ transmitted to the cloud; the third layer is\nthe decision layer in which the\
    \ data are analysed and processed to make decisions according to the\nobservations.\n\
    There are several challenges in IoT-based systems due to exponential increasing\
    \ devices. As in\na typical IoT network, every node transmits data to the remote\
    \ cloud, which results in cloud\ncongestion, and the main challenges underlying\
    \ the IOT-based system are latency with minimum\npower requirements, better usage\
    \ of bandwidth and intermittent Internet connectivity. Fog computing\nand edge\
    \ computing are the state-of-the-art techniques to overcome these issues; which\
    \ reduce the\ncomputational burden of cloud. The main goal of fog computing is\
    \ to conserve energy and bandwidth,\nwhich helps to increase the quality of service\
    \ to the end users. In [5], an energy-efﬁcient architecture of\nthe Fog of Everything\
    \ was presented, which was comprised of six layers. The ﬁrst layer was an Internet\n\
    Of Everything (IOE) layer, where things (could be ﬁxed, mobile or nomadic) functioned\
    \ under multiple\nspatially-distributed clusters. The second was a wireless access\
    \ network that supported Thing to Fog\n(T2F) and Fog to Thing (F2T) communication\
    \ over the wireless channel. In the third layer, the connected\nfog nodes behaved\
    \ such as a virtualized cluster. There was an inter-fog backbone in the fourth\
    \ layer,\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n3 of 25\nwhich was responsible for connectivity\
    \ among fog nodes. The next layer was the virtualization layer,\nwhich provided\
    \ each connected thing with the ability to augment its limited resource set, exploiting\n\
    the computation capability at the virtual clone. In the last layer, there was\
    \ an overlay inter-clone\nvirtual network that empowered Peer to Peer (P2P) communication.\
    \ Then, a protocol stack for FOE\nwas presented, which was further tested by creating\
    \ a small prototype named as V-FOE and simulated\non the iFogsim toolkit. The\
    \ results provided strong evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed\nframework\
    \ and more energy efﬁciency with reduced failure rate and delay.\nTable 1. Wireless\

    The energy efﬁciency is the most serious consideration while developing any fog\
    \ architecture.\nIn [6], an energy-efﬁcient protocol for a fog-supported wireless\
    \ sensor network was presented, which\nmaximized the lifetime of the network by\
    \ uniformly distributing the energy among connected nodes.\nThe performance of\
    \ the proposed algorithm was compared with the existing state-of-the-art algorithms\n\
    Sensors 2019, 19, 3796\n4 of 25\nin MATLAB. The results showed that the proposed\
    \ algorithm was highly energy efﬁcient with a\nprolonged network lifetime.\nRegardless\
    \ of all the advancements in the IoT domain, the adoption of PA has been limited\
    \ to\nsome developed countries. Because of the lack of resources, remote sensing-based\
    \ techniques to\nmonitor crop health are not common in under-developed countries\
    \ such as Pakistan, which results in\na loss of yield. Pakistan is an agricultural\
    \ country due to is large arable land and climatic variations,\nwhich make it\
    \ suitable to cultivate multiple types of crops. Despite all these natural resources,\
    \ Pakistan\nis still unable to produce massive yields [7]. The main reason behind\
    \ the low production is traditional\nfarming practices, which are used for crop\
    \ health monitoring and yield estimation. These techniques\nare completely based\
    \ on farmer’s intuition and experience. Farmers visit the ﬁelds in order to monitor\n\
    the crop, which is very laborious and quite challenging in the case of large arable\
    \ land. In this case, the\narea under insect/pest attack is inaccurately measured,\
    \ which can result in over spraying of insecticide\nand pesticide, which adversely\
    \ affects the nutrition in crops.\nKeeping in mind all these issues, our motivation\
    \ is to provide the industry and research\ncommunities with a survey of technologies,\
    \ metrics and current practices concerning communication\ndevices, sensors and\
    \ platforms used to monitor and analyse multiple sources of data (spectral images,\n\
    IoT, etc.) used in environmental and agriculture applications. As the main contribution,\
    \ we generated\na technological taxonomy for PA, which was driven by an IoT-based\
    \ architecture to monitor the crops’\nhealth. The developed system had two modules\
    \ including wireless sensor network-based crop heath\nmonitoring in which multiple\
    \ sensors were used to get the real-time heath status of crop; the other\none\
    \ was NDVI-based analysis of spectra images captured by a drone to assess the\
    \ chlorophyll content,\nwhich was further used to monitor the health of the crop.\n\

    \ wireless\ncommunication technologies used in the agriculture domain; Section\

    \ protocols have been introduced in the last few decades due to the rapid\nincrease\
    \ in IoT devices and WSN technologies. Each protocol has its own speciﬁcations\
    \ depending on\nthe bandwidth, number of free channels, data rate, battery timing,\
    \ price and other factors [8]. The most\ncommonly-used protocols for wireless\
    \ communication in IoT-based applications in agriculture are:\nSensors 2019, 19,\
    \ 3796\n5 of 25\n2.1. Cellular\nCellular technology is most suitable for applications\
    \ that require an extraordinary data rate.\nIt can utilize GSM, 3G and 4G cellular\
    \ communication capabilities by providing reliable high-speed\nconnectivity to\
    \ the Internet, requiring higher power consumption.\nIt requires infrastructure\
    \ to\nbe deployed and operation cost and back up staff for it with a centralized\
    \ managed authority.\n4G cellular technology requires more battery power, but\
    \ cellular technology is a good option in\nunderground wireless sensor networks,\
    \ such as security systems in smart home projects and agriculture\napplications\
    \ [9]. A smart irrigation systems was presented in [10], in which several soil\
    \ moisture\nsensors were deployed in the ﬁeld in the ZigBee mesh network. The\
    \ reading captured from the ﬁelds\nwere transmitted over the cloud using the cellular\
    \ 4G LTE network.\n2.2. 6LoWPAN\n6LoWPAN is an IP-based communication protocol,\
    \ which was the ﬁrst protocol used for IoT\ncommunication. 6LoWPAN is also low\
    \ cost because of the low bandwidth and low power consumption.\n6LoWPAN supports\
    \ multiple topologies such as star and mesh topologies. To handle interoperability\n\
    between IPv6 and IEEE 802.15.4, there is an adaptation layer between the network\
    \ layer and the\nMAC layer [8]. The applications for 6LoWPAN are monitoring the\
    \ health equipment, environment\nmonitoring and in security and home automation\
    \ systems. In [11], a 6LoWPAN-enabled wireless sensor\nnetwork was presented to\
    \ monitor the soil properties of crops. The 6LoWPAN system architecture\nfor precision\
    \ agriculture application was discussed in [12] where the performance evaluation\
    \ of this\nprotocol was discussed with several baud rates and power constraints.\n\
    2.3. ZigBee\nZigBee is a wireless communication protocol widely used in precision\
    \ agriculture to monitor\nenvironmental conditions related to crops’ health [13].\
    \ It is based on the wireless 802.15.4 standard.\nBasically, it was developed\
    \ for personal area networks by the ZigBee alliance [8]. It has a ﬂexible\nnetwork\
    \ structure, long battery life, supports mesh, star and tree topology with multi-hop\
    \ data\ntransmission, is easily installed and supports large nodes. It has a short\
    \ range with limited data speed\nand is less secure compared to Wi-Fi-based systems.\
    \ ZigBee is very common in smart agriculture\napplications such as smart green\
    \ houses and smart irrigation systems [14]. In [15], a smart irrigation\nsystem\
    \ was presented based on the ZigBee communication protocol. This system consisted\
    \ of two\nnodes, i.e., a sensor node and an actuator node. The sensor node was\
    \ comprised of soil moisture\nsensors, which monitored the water level in the\
    \ soil. The actuator module was responsible for taking\nactions according to the\
    \ water level of the soil. All communication was carried out by means of\nZigBee\
    \ protocol.\n2.4. BLE\nBLE is as famous as the Bluetooth smart technology, which\
    \ is a suitable protocol for IoT\napplications including agriculture [16]. It\
    \ is particularly designed for low bandwidth, low latency and\nshort range for\
    \ IoT applications. The main advantages of BLE over typical Bluetooth include\
    \ lower\nsetup time, lower power consumption and unlimited support for nodes in\
    \ a star topology. It has a\nvery limited range of 10 meters. However, the drawbacks\
    \ are that it can only provide communication\nbetween two devices, it presents\
    \ low security, and it can lose connection during communication. In [17],\na BLE-based\
    \ infrastructure was presented to collect the sensors’ data. The proposed system\
    \ utilized a\nsmart phone to collect the data of sensors using BLE, where sensors\
    \ were deployed in the plants, i.e.,\nsoil moisture sensors and soil temperature\
    \ sensor.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n6 of 25\n2.5. RFID\nRFID systems consist of\
    \ a reader and a transponder, which have a very small radio frequency,\ncalled\
    \ the RF tag. This tag is programmed electronically with distinctive information\
    \ that has a reading\ncharacteristic. RFID has two technologies for the tag system\
    \ the ﬁrst is the active reader tag system,\nand the other is the passive reader\
    \ tag. Active reader tag systems are more expensive, as they utilize\nmore battery\
    \ power and use high frequencies. However, passive reader tag systems are low\
    \ powered.\nSome IoT applications using RFID include smart shopping, healthcare,\
    \ national security and smart\nagriculture applications. An IoT-based smart irrigation\
    \ system based on RFID was presented in [18].\nThe system was comprised of soil\
    \ moisture and soil temperature sensors along with a water control\nsystem, so\
    \ it collected the reading of the sensors and sent these readings to the cloud\
    \ using RFID\ncommunication protocols, where the user controlled a water pump\
    \ based on the water level of the soil.\n2.6. Wi-Fi\nWi-Fi is the most common\
    \ communication protocol that enables devices to communicate over\na wireless\
    \ signal. Wi-Fi provides Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) connectivity to millions\
    \ of\nlocations, i.e., homes, ofﬁces and public locations such as cafes, hotels\
    \ and airports with high speed.\nThe Wi-Fi protocol supports IEEE 802.11, 802.11a,\
    \ 802.11b, 802.11g and 802.11n. Wi-Fi is widely used\nin IoT-based applications\
    \ including agriculture systems, i.e., smart irrigation, crop health monitoring\n\
    and greenhouses. In [19], an infrastructure was presented to monitor environmental\
    \ parameters\ninside the greenhouse such as temperature, light intensity and soil\
    \ moisture level. This platform\nwas comprised of sensors that collected the data\
    \ related to the environmental variation and sent to\nthe cloud using Wi-Fi. Similarly,\
    \ another smart agriculture system based on Wi-Fi communication\nprotocols was\
    \ presented in [20]. This last one consisted of a Raspberry Pi connected with\
    \ multiple\nsensors, which collected the data. The collected data were further\
    \ transmitted to the cloud using Wi-Fi\ncommunication protocols.\n2.7. LoRaWAN\n\
    LoRaWAN operates on the LoRa network. LoRaWAN deﬁnes the system architecture and\n\
    communication protocol of the network, while the physical layer of LoRa enables\
    \ the link for\nlong-range communication. LoRaWAN manages the frequencies in communication,\
    \ data rate and\npower consumption for all devices. LoRaWAN is common in agricultural\
    \ applications because of\nits large coverage area and low power consumption [21].\
    \ In [14], a smart irrigation system based on\nLoRaWAN was presented. Table 3\
    \ shows the comparison of all mentioned wireless communication\nprotocols [8].\
    \ Among all wireless communication technologies, 6LoWPAN and ZigBee are considered\n\
    to be more suitable for PA application because both are based on mesh networking,\
    \ which makes them\nsuitable to cover large area.\nTable 3. Wireless communication\

    \ Image-Based Remote Sensing\nRemote sensing has been widely used in PA to monitor\
    \ crops’ health for the last two decades.\nRemote sensing is a phenomenon in which\
    \ physical conditions of the Earth are observed remotely by\ncalculating the emitted\
    \ and reﬂected radiation from some distance. There are special cameras that\n\
    are used to capture images for further analysis to ﬁnd the characteristics of\
    \ a speciﬁc area. Multiple\nplatforms are used to mount these cameras that capture\
    \ images of the objects.\n3.1. Spectral Image Platforms\nRemote sensing platform\
    \ considerations for spectral images are airborne-based, satellite-based\nand\
    \ Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-based [22]. Each platform has its own coverage\
    \ range, which\nis determined by three factors: (i) Ground Sampling Distance (GSD),\
    \ which is computed in terms of\nspatial resolution, (ii) data collection rate\
    \ or frequency and (iii) average distance between the object\nand sensor. Apart\
    \ from coverage range, several factors [23] affect the performance of platforms,\n\
    as mentioned in Table 4.\nTable 4. Key differences between spectral image platforms.\n\

    \ are considered to be the most stable platforms among\nall others. These platforms\
    \ consist of satellites, rockets and space shuttles. Space borne platforms are\n\
    categorized based on the orbits and timing. The advantages of satellite-based\
    \ remote sensing include\nhigh spatial resolution, which makes it promising to\
    \ extract extensive time-series data. The images\nobtained by satellite platforms\
    \ cover large area and are stable without noise, which is normally induced\ndue\
    \ to interference while image capturing. However, the main problem with satellite-based\
    \ platforms\nis their high cost in the case of high spatial resolution images.\
    \ The second problem is their strictly ﬁxed\ntime schedule, so data cannot be\
    \ collected at critical timings. The re-visitation times vary from twice\nin one\
    \ day to 16 days, depending on the orbit of the satellite. The other big problem\
    \ is that satellite\nplatforms are highly sensitive to weather conditions, so\
    \ if the weather is cloudy, the captured image will\nhave less detailed information.\
    \ Table 5 shows the main types of satellites with their speciﬁcations [22].\n\
    Among all satellite platforms presented in Table 5, some satellite data are freely\
    \ available,\nwhile others provide a commercial solution. The commercial solutions\
    \ such as Pleiades-1 provide\nimages with a high resolution and a revisit time\
    \ of one day. QuickBird, Landsat-8 and Sentinel are\nfrequently-used satellite\
    \ platforms used to obtain hyperspectral imagery. QuickBird was launched\nin 2001\
    \ by USA. The Panchromatic (PAN) and four Multi-Spectral (MS) imagery sensors\
    \ are used in\nQuickBird with a GSD of 0.7 × 0.7–2.6 × 2.6 m with a revisit time\
    \ 1–3.5 days. QuickBird provides a\nsmall revisit time, but it is a commercial\
    \ solution. In contrast to QuickBird, Landsat-8 and Sentinel\nprovide free solutions.\
    \ Landsat-8 was launched in 2013 by the USA. Landsat-8 provides a GSD of\n16 days\
    \ with PAN and 11-MS imagery sensors. Though revisit time of Landsat-8 is much\
    \ higher\ncompared to QuickBird, but it provides images with 11 different multi-spectral\
    \ bands.\nSentinel is another broadly-used satellite launched by the EU. It currently\
    \ has three missions,\ni.e., Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3. These missions\
    \ provide images with 21 MS bands with\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n8 of 25\nrevisit\
    \ times of 5–10 days depending on which Sentinel mission is used. However, Sentinel-2\
    \ is a\ncommonly-used platform in precision agriculture as it provides data freely\
    \ at a 10-m spatial resolution\nand covers a swath width of 290 km. By combining\
    \ Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B, the revisit time is\nfurther reduced to ﬁve days,\
    \ which helps in change detection. The complete details of all satellite\nplatforms\
    \ with their speciﬁcations are listed in Table 5, where other platforms such as\
    \ SAT, MODIS\nand WordView are also considered.\nTable 5. Satellite platforms\

    \ a vibrant alternative to satellite and airborne, which are quite ﬂexible and\
    \ cost\neffective. A typical UAV platform consists of a communication and navigation\
    \ system that incorporates\na set of sensors mounted on it. Among UAV platforms,\
    \ there are mainly ﬁxed-wing platforms. and\nmultirotor options are available.\
    \ The ﬂying time is based on the payload weight. In general, a longer\nﬂying time\
    \ is achieved by ﬁxed-wing systems, which demands lighter weight payloads. For\
    \ example,\nhigh-deﬁnition cameras weighing less than 300 grams as the payload\
    \ of a ﬁxed-wing UAV allow it to ﬂy\nfor around two hours using currently available\
    \ battery power [24]. On the contrary, battery-powered\nmultirotor UAV with higher\
    \ payload capacity have a reduced ﬂying time, i.e., around 15–25 min.\nTable 7\
    \ shows UAV platforms commonly used in the agriculture domain and concretely to\
    \ monitor\nthe health of crops remotely [22]. Among these platforms, DJI/Phantom-2\
    \ is a more suitable choice\nfor intermediate agricultural land because of its\
    \ low cost and ease of use. The other advantage of this\nplatform is that it provides\
    \ support for mounting multiple cameras, which helps to monitor the crop in\n\
    multiple electro-magnetic bands. The American Aerospace/RS-16 is also an option\
    \ because of its ﬂight\ntime and large are coverage, but due to its high cost,\
    \ this platform is not common.\nIn [25], the ESAFLY A2500_WH helicopter was used\
    \ to implement the platform of the UAV\nwith Tetra cam ADC Micro as the camera\
    \ to capture hyper-spectral images of two different types of\ncultivation, i.e.,\
    \ vineyard and tomato. The images captured by the UAV platform are very high in\n\
    resolution, so more information can be extracted as compared to satellite images.\
    \ To assess the health\nof a crop, three types of Vegetation Index (VI) maps have\
    \ been computed.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n10 of 25\nTable 7. UAV platforms for\

    Camera\n3.2. Vegetation Indices\nUsing multi-spectral images from the remote sensors\
    \ described above, a series of Vegetation\nIndices (VIs) can be computed. Vegetation\
    \ Indices (VIs) obtained from remote sensing-based canopies\nare effective algorithms\
    \ for quantitative and qualitative evaluations of vigour, vegetation cover and\n\
    growth dynamics, among other applications [26]. Hitherto, no uniﬁed mathematical\
    \ expression exists\nthat deﬁnes all VIs due to the complexity of the several\
    \ light spectra combinations, instrumentation,\nresolutions and platforms used.\
    \ In particular, this section focuses on vegetation indices NDVI, GDVI\nand SAVI,\
    \ as they are widely used in PA.\n3.2.1. NDVI\nThe Normalized Difference Vegetation\
    \ Index (NDVI) is the most popular VI that is extensively\nused to ﬁnd the content\
    \ of green in PA applications [27,28]. It uses Red (R) and Near Infrared (NIR)\n\
    channels to compute the NDVI index. More NIR light is absorbed by healthy vegetation;\
    \ however,\nabsorption ratio is very small for red light. NDVI is computed by\
    \ Equation (1) and returns a value\nbetween −1 and 1 [29].\nNDVI = NIR − R\nNIR\
    \ + R\n(1)\nHigher NDVI value indicate healthy vegetation, while smaller values\
    \ of NDVI show that vegetation is\nvery small at that speciﬁc region. There is\
    \ another form of NDVI, i.e., the Green Normalized Vegetation\nIndex (GNDVI),\
    \ which uses the green channel instead of red. GNDVI is computed by Equation (2):\n\
    GNDVI = NIR − G\nNIR + G\n(2)\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n11 of 25\n3.2.2. Difference\
    \ Vegetation Index\nThe DVI was proposed to reduce the effect of soil reﬂectance,\
    \ which is not covered by NDVI [30].\nDVI is different between the reﬂectance\
    \ of the NIR band to the reﬂectance of the red band. DVI is also\ncomputed with\
    \ the green band, i.e., GDVI. Both DVI and GDVI are computed by Equations (3)\
    \ and (4):\nDVI = NIR − R\n(3)\nGDVI = NIR − G\n(4)\n3.2.3. SAVI\nNDVI and DVI\
    \ do not compensate the background effect of soil. Therefore, many vegetation\n\
    indices were introduced to compensate the effect of soil reﬂectance. The Soil\
    \ Adjusted Vegetation Index\n(SAVI), the Green Soil Adjusted vegetation Index\
    \ (GSAVI), the Optimized Soil Adjusted Vegetation\nIndex (OSAVI), the Green Optimized\
    \ Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (OGSAVI) and the Modiﬁed\nSoil Adjusted Vegetation\
    \ Index (MSAVI) [31–33] are common among them, which are computed by\nEquations\
    \ (5)–(9):\nSAVI =\n1.5(NIR − R)\n(NIR + R + 0.5)\n(5)\nGSAVI = 1.5(NIR − G)\n\
    NIR + G + 0.5\n(6)\nOSAVI =\n(NIR − G)\nNIR + R + 0.16\n(7)\nGOSAVI =\n(NIR −\
    \ G)\nNIR + G + 0.16\n(8)\nMSAVI = 0.5[2(NIR + 1) −\nq\n(2NIR + 1)2 − 8(NIR −\
    \ R)]\n(9)\n3.2.4. NR and NG:\nNormalized Red (NR) and Normalized Green (NG) are\
    \ two other famous vegetation indices being\nused in PA [33]. NR focuses on the\
    \ part of spectrum where radiation is absorbed by chlorophyll, while\nNG focuses\
    \ on the part of the spectrum where radiation is absorbed by other pigments, excluding\n\
    chlorophyll. NR and NG are computed by Equations (10) and (11):\nNR =\nR\nNIR\
    \ + R + G\n(10)\nNG =\nG\nNIR + R + G\n(11)\n4. Wireless Sensor Network Applications\
    \ in Agriculture\nMultiple applications of wireless sensor networks are being\
    \ utilized today in the agriculture sector.\nSome very common applications are\
    \ smart irrigation, smart fertilization, smart pest control and green\nhouse monitoring.\n\
    4.1. Smart Irrigation Systems\nSmart irrigation is an artiﬁcial irrigation application\
    \ that controls the quantity of water by making\na decision about where water\
    \ is needed. It is the most signiﬁcant constituent in agriculture, which has\n\
    a great impact on crops’ health, cost and productivity. One major aspect of smart\
    \ irrigation is to avoid\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n12 of 25\nthe wastage of water\
    \ since most countries in the world are facing water scarcity problems. A smart\n\
    irrigation system was presented in [34] in which a Raspberry Pi was used along\
    \ with two sensors:\na soil moisture sensor was used to assess the water level\
    \ in the soil, while a temperature and humidity\nsensor was used to monitor the\
    \ environmental condition. The Raspberry Pi was connected to these\nsensors and\
    \ the water supply network. A mobile application was developed for remote monitoring\n\
    and remote water ﬂow control enabling both manual and automatic water ﬂow control.\
    \ In automatic\nmode, water ﬂow was automatically turned ON/OFF based on the water\
    \ level of the soil without\nhuman intervention. In manual mode, the user was\
    \ able to monitor the soil moisture level. An alert\nwas generated when the water\
    \ level of soil was getting below a speciﬁc threshold, and the user turned\nit\
    \ ON/OFF using a mobile application.\nPower is a big concern in IoT-based platforms,\
    \ so many researchers have developed power-\nefﬁcient systems. A power-efﬁcient\
    \ water irrigation system was presented using solar power [35]\nin which the controller\
    \ was connected to the soil sensor and water supply valve. The water valve\nwas\
    \ turned ON/OFF based on the water level monitored by the moisture sensor. The\
    \ power was\nsupplied by the solar panel, so the system was independent of any\
    \ external power module. Another\nsensor-based IoT system for water irrigation\
    \ was presented in [36] in which the controller controlled\nthe opening and closing\
    \ of a solenoid valve based on the water level of the soil. In addition, a series\
    \ of\nweather alerts were sent to the user via a mobile application to update\
    \ the temperature and humidity of\nthe environment, which had a direct inﬂuence\
    \ on the water level of the soil. In [37], an energy-efﬁcient\nirrigation system\
    \ for cultivated crops was presented using a wireless sensor network in which\
    \ water\nwas effectively controlled based on environmental conditions. This system\
    \ estimated the quantity of\nwater needed for normal irrigation based on the humidity,\
    \ temperature and wind speed collected by\nsensors along with historical data.\n\
    In [38], an IoT-based irrigation system was presented using soil moisture sensors\
    \ controlled by\nATMEGA 328P on an Arduino UNO board along with a GPRS module.\
    \ The data collected from the\nsensors were sent to the cloud, i.e., Things Speak,\
    \ where graphs were generated to visualize the data\ntrends. A web portal was\
    \ also designed where the farmer was able to check the status of water, if it\n\
    was ON/OFF. Similarly, a real-time prototype for an irrigation system was presented\
    \ in [39] in which\nsoil moisture sensors and soil temperature sensors were used\
    \ to assess the water status of the soil.\nRFID was used to transmit data to the\
    \ cloud for further data analysis. Using ATMEGA 328, a water\nsprinkler system\
    \ for smart irrigation was presented in [40] using temperature, humidity and soil\n\
    moisture sensors. The water sprinkler was controlled based on the soil moisture\
    \ level to save water\nand reduce human effort. In [41], a cost-effective drip\
    \ irrigation system for a home was proposed in\nwhich a Raspberry Pi, Arduino,\
    \ electronic water control valve and relay were used. ZigBee protocols\nwere used\
    \ for communication. The user turned ON/OFF the water valve by sending commands\
    \ to the\nRaspberry Pi, which further processed the commands through the Arduino.\n\
    The sensors placement is a big issue that affects the accuracy of sensors. A detailed\
    \ discussion of\nsoil moisture positioning in the ﬁeld and their accuracy was\
    \ presented in [42]. For real-time irrigation\nsystems, complete software and\
    \ hardware requirements, problems and challenges and advantages\nwere discussed\
    \ in [43] where a big picture of the complete system was provided.\n4.2. Smart\
    \ Fertilization System\nFertilizer is an artiﬁcial or natural substance having\
    \ some chemical elements used to enhance\nthe growth and productivity of plants.\
    \ Manual spraying is a common technique used for fertilization.\nHowever, the\
    \ optimal way of fertilization requires sensing capabilities to ﬁnd the exact\
    \ place where\nfertilizer is needed, which chemical components are missing and\
    \ the amount of fertilizer needed.\nIt is important to provide fertilizers in\
    \ a very precise amount in order to improve productivity [44].\nMultiple fertilization\
    \ techniques have been presented by researchers since the last decade using WSN\n\
    and IoT.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n13 of 25\nAn automated fertilization system\
    \ was presented in [45] using real-time sensors to measure the\nsoil fertility.\
    \ The system consisted of three modules including input, output and decision support.\n\
    The decision support module measured the optimal amount of fertilizers needed\
    \ for the growth of the\nplants based on the real-time sensory data captured by\
    \ the sensors. A mechanical sensor named the\n“Pendulum Meter” was introduced\
    \ in [46], which was used for optimal fertilization. This sensor was\nmounted\
    \ on the tractor to measure the density of the crop, so the corresponding fertilizer\
    \ spreader\nwas controlled based on the readings of this sensor. The IEEE 802.11\
    \ Wi-Fi module was used for\ncommunication along with GPS. Real-time data of soil\
    \ were collected by several sensors, i.e., soil\nmoisture, temperature, conductivity,\
    \ NO2, CO2, etc. A Geographical Information System (GIS) server\nwas used to interpolate\
    \ sensory data.\n4.3. Smart Pest Control and Early Disease Detection System\n\
    Pest attacks are the root cause of low productivity in the agriculture sector.\
    \ These pests result in\nseveral serious diseases in plants that affect the plant’s\
    \ growth. However, disease prediction provides\nearly warning to the farmers,\
    \ which enables them to make appropriate decisions to control the disease\non\
    \ time. Pest control systems are comprised of electronic devices that enable humans\
    \ to identify traps\nin a speciﬁc range of these electronic devices [47]. These\
    \ electronic devices are sensors capable of\ncalculating the environmental parameters\
    \ for further analysis.\nMuch research has been done in the agriculture sector\
    \ for early disease detection and pest control\nsystems using more advanced and\
    \ sophisticated technologies [48,49]. Multiple imagery sensors have\nbeen used\
    \ by different researchers to collect imagery data, such as: RGB sensors, ﬂuorescence\
    \ imagery\nsensors, spectral sensors and thermal sensors [50]. The thermal sensors\
    \ are used to measure the water\nstatus in the plant by measuring the temperature,\
    \ since this parameter has a direct inﬂuence on the\nwater level in the plants.\
    \ RGB images have three colour channels, i.e., red, green and blue, which\ncan\
    \ be used to perceive the biometric effect in the plants. Multi- and hyper-spectral\
    \ sensors capture\nimages containing the spatial information of objects in multiple\
    \ wavebands. The spatial resolution is\ndependent on the distance between the\
    \ object and the sensor. That is why satellite images contain less\nspatial resolution\
    \ as compared to low altitude platforms such as drones. The ﬂuorescence sensors\
    \ are\nused to distinguish the photosynthetic activities in the plants. Various\
    \ image processing techniques\nare applied to these imagery data to identify the\
    \ diseases in plants.\nIn [50], an IoT-based plants disease and pest prediction\
    \ system was presented to minimize the\nexcessive use of fungicides and insecticides.\
    \ Weather condition monitoring sensors, i.e., temperature,\ndew, humidity and\
    \ wind speed, are used to monitor weather parameters to ﬁnd a correlation between\n\
    pest growth with weather. The sensors have been deployed in orchards, and data\
    \ collected from these\nsensors are sent to the cloud. The farmer is informed\
    \ about the alarming condition of the pest attack\non the crops.\nFrom a different\
    \ point of view, hyper-spectral images are used to analyse crops’ health and pest\n\
    attack using manned or unmanned vehicles on which spectral cameras are mounted.\
    \ The captured\nimages are analysed in depth using machine learning techniques\
    \ to identify the disease in the plants.\nAdvance Neural Networks (ANNs) are more\
    \ common for processing imagery data due to their ability\nto learn complex structures\
    \ and patterns. Using hyper-spectral images, a system was presented [51] to\n\
    identify disease or pest attack in crops. The proposed system for disease detection\
    \ used an ANN with\nmultiple layers.\nEarly disease detection in sugar beet plants\
    \ was presented in [52]. For early detection, four\nsupervised classiﬁcation algorithms\
    \ were applied on spectral images. Spectral images were then\ncollected for each\
    \ image, and multiple vegetation indices were calculated to be used in predictive\n\
    and perspective analysis. The vegetation indices used were NVDI, SR, SIPI, PSSRaand\
    \ PSSRb, ARI,\nREP, mCAIand RRE. These vegetation indices values were used as\
    \ features in the dataset. Support\nVector Machine (SVM), ANN, and decision tree\
    \ were used for classiﬁcation. A comparative analysis\nwas performed which, showed\
    \ that SVM outperformed other classiﬁers for disease detection with an\nSensors\
    \ 2019, 19, 3796\n14 of 25\naccuracy of 97.12%. In [53], a data mining technique\
    \ was applied on the already collected dataset of\ntwo types of crops, i.e., wheat\
    \ and paddy (rice), in India. For dimension reduction, Sammon’s mapping\nwas used\
    \ for multi-dimension scaling, i.e., to reduce the dimension also for unsupervised\
    \ learning.\nFor high dimensional data, dimension reduction is required prior\
    \ to performing further data analysis\nfor better data visualization and accuracy,\
    \ since redundant dimensions reduce the effectiveness of\nany data analysis algorithms.\
    \ Principle Component Analysis (PCA) is a very often-used technique\nalong with\
    \ Sammon’s mapping. Data from multi-dimensions were reduced to two or three dimensions.\n\
    Then, the Self-Organized Maps (SOM) algorithm for clustering was used to ﬁnd correlations\
    \ between\nthe data. The accuracy comparison of SOM and Sammon’s mapping was presented,\
    \ which showed\nthat SOM performed better on a large dataset, while Sammon’s mapping\
    \ was suitable for small ones.\nSmart phones played important role in data acquisition,\
    \ which were further used to monitor the crops’\nhealth. In [54], the health of\
    \ wheat crop was monitored using near surface imagery captured by a smart\nphone.\
    \ The crop was classiﬁed as healthy or unhealthy based on the green level by computing\
    \ Gcc.\nMost of the applications in PA have been either IoT-based in which multiple\
    \ sensors are used to\nassess the health of the crop or remote sensing-based in\
    \ which crop health is assessed by performing\nsome computation on spectral images.\
    \ We can compare crop health monitoring application based\non some attributes\
    \ such as which sensors are used in particular applications, whether web or mobile\n\
    services are provided or not, etc. The comparative analysis of some existing crop\
    \ health monitoring\napplications is presented in Table 8 based on some attributes.\n\
    To precisely monitor the crop health, both IoT-based techniques and remote sensing\
    \ techniques\nshould be used together to provide more reliable and accurate information\
    \ about the crop. As a\nproof of concept, we present a case study in which a crop\
    \ health monitoring system based on IoT and\nremote sensing techniques is proposed.\
    \ We provide a complete end-to-end solution in the agriculture\ndomain by facilitating\
    \ the agricultural user with web and mobile services so that he/she could be\n\
    informed about the latest condition of the crop in a timely manner. In this way,\
    \ remedy actions could\nbe performed in time, which will result in enhanced production.\n\

    \ Precision Agriculture\nWe developed a complete solution for crop health monitoring\
    \ based on IoT and remote sensing.\nIn the proposed system, crop health is monitored\
    \ using data collected from multiple IoT sensors,\nas well as NDVI mapping of\
    \ spectral images captured by a drone. The architecture of the proposed\nsystem\
    \ is shown in Figure 1, which was designed according to two main modules. The\
    \ ﬁrst module\nwas a wireless sensor network-based system in which multiple wireless\
    \ nodes were developed. Each\nwireless node was comprised of a soil moisture sensor\
    \ used to monitor the water level of the soil,\na soil temperature sensor used\
    \ to check the temperature of the soil and air temperature and humidity\nsensors.\
    \ These nodes were deployed across the ﬁeld in a star topology fashion where the\
    \ master node\ncollected readings from all slave nodes and transmitted the captured\
    \ reading to the back-end server for\nfurther processing. The master node acted\
    \ as a gateway node, which received data from all slave nodes\nusing NRF communication\
    \ module. After performing initial processing, the master node transmitted\nthe\
    \ data to the cloud using GSM communication technology. In the case of the unavailability\
    \ of the\nGSM network, this node stored the captured data and transmitted to the\
    \ cloud upon the availability\nof network.\nThe second module was used to monitor\
    \ crop health using multi-spectral imagery, which was\ncollected by a multi-spectral\
    \ camera mounted on a drone. The NDVI was computed using Equation (1)\nto classify\
    \ between healthy and unhealthy plants by measuring the chlorophyll content in\
    \ the crops,\nwhich was further used to localize the area under stress precisely.\n\
    All collected data were sent to the cloud where further analysis was performed.\
    \ The web portal\nwas designed to help the farmer monitor the crop proﬁle over\
    \ the whole life cycle. Currently, we are\nmonitoring soil moisture, soil temperature,\
    \ air moisture and air temperature readings in real time\nalong with NDVI mapping\
    \ of spectral imagery. Multiple web services were provided on the web\nportal\
    \ including historical/real data visualization using graphs, weather monitoring,\
    \ NDVI mapping\nand the correlation among measured parameters. Figure 2 shows\
    \ the snapshots of the web portal\nalong with different services.\nFigure 1. System\
    \ architecture.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n17 of 25\nFigure 2. User interface of\
    \ the web portal.\nFor portability and remote monitoring, a mobile application\
    \ was also developed to facilitate the\nfarmer/agronomist/landlord with all the\
    \ web services that are available on web portal. The alerts\nare generated when\
    \ an abnormal behaviour is observed in the crop, which help the farmer to take\n\
    remedy actions in a timely manner. The user interfaces of the mobile application\
    \ are shown in Figure 3.\nTherefore, the web portal along with mobile applications\
    \ provides a complete solution, which enables\nagricultural users monitor the\
    \ current status of the crop, as well as previous details.\nFigure 3. User interface\
    \ of the mobile application.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n18 of 25\n6. Results and\
    \ Discussion\n6.1. Analysis of the Data Collected by IoT Nodes\nThe developed\
    \ IoT nodes were deployed across the wheat ﬁelds of an area of 1.4375 hectare.\n\
    The selected area was located in Islamabad, Pakistan. The wheat ﬁelds are shown\
    \ in Figure 4 along\nwith the IoT node and sensors. We deployed the system across\
    \ the wheat ﬁeld in March 2019 when\nwheat was in the grain ﬁlling and grain ripening\
    \ stage.\nFigure 4. System deployed across the wheat ﬁelds.\nWe collected the\
    \ sensors’ readings such as air temperature, air humidity, soil temperature and\n\
    soil moisture. We compared the observed crop parameters with the ideal wheat temperature\
    \ proﬁle\nas shown in Figure 5. Extreme variation in the weather of Islamabad\
    \ was observed in that particular\ntime period, which can be seen by how the actual\
    \ temperature for wheat crop deviated from the ideal\ntemperature proﬁle of the\
    \ wheat crop.\nFigure 5. Deviation of observed temperature from the ideal temperature\
    \ proﬁle.\nAdditionally, we performed linear regression to ﬁnd the correlation\
    \ between observed parameters,\nwhich provided insight into how changes in one\
    \ parameter can effect the other parameter. The linear\nregression found a relation\
    \ between the two parameters by ﬁtting the equation of the line using the\nobserved\
    \ dataset [69]. Equation (12) represents an equation of the line where mrepresents\
    \ the slope of\nline, while c indicates the y-intercept. The variables m and c\
    \ were learned from the data.\ny = mx + c\n(12)\nFigure 6A shows the correlation\
    \ between the observed air temperature and air humidity, which showed\nthat both\
    \ were negatively correlated. The correlation between air temperature and soil\
    \ temperature is\nshown in Figure 6B, which shows that both were positively correlated.\n\
    Sensors 2019, 19, 3796\n19 of 25\n(A)\n(B)\nFigure 6. (A) Correlation b/wair temperature\
    \ and air humidity. (B) Correlation b/w air temperature\nand soil temperature.\n\
    The rise in air temperature caused the air humidity to reduce, while it resulted\
    \ in an increase in\nsoil temperature and vice versa.\n6.2. Analysis of Multi-spectral\
    \ Images Captured by Drone\nTo collect multi-spectral imagery, we used the DJI-Phantom\
    \ Pro Advanced drone with the Sentera\nMulti-spectral-imaging sensor. The drone\
    \ had its own optical camera, while the multi-spectral camera\nwas mounted on\
    \ it to obtain spectral images. Multiple ﬂights of the drone were carried out\
    \ at the\nspeciﬁc growing stages of the crop, i.e., grain ripening and grain ﬁlling\
    \ stage. After collecting these\nimages, they were transferred to the cloud for\
    \ NDVI mapping. Figure 7A shows the optical image\nthat was captured on 16 May\
    \ 2019 when wheat was in the harvesting stage, while Figure 7B is its\nspectral\
    \ image, and Figure 7C is the NDVI mapping. Since wheat was at a mature stage,\
    \ its NDVI\nshould be very small, i.e., ideally there should be no green region\
    \ in the ﬁeld. However, in NDVI\nmapping, a large green region indicated the abnormal\
    \ behaviour of the crop. The green region was\ndue to naturally growing plants.\
    \ This information can be visualized on the web portal.\n(A)\n(B)\n(C)\nFigure\
    \ 7. Wheat crop. (A) Optical image; (B) spectral image; (C) NDVI mapping.\nThe\
    \ same process was performed in a maize ﬁeld when maize was in the grain ripening\
    \ stage.\nFigure 8A shows the optical image that was captured on 24 July 2019\
    \ when maize was in the grain\nripening stage, while Figure 8B is its spectral\
    \ image, and Figure 8C is the NDVI mapping. The same\nbehaviour can be observed\
    \ with the maize crop, i.e., there should be a minimal green region in the\nﬁeld.\
    \ However, in NDVI mapping, a large green region indicated the abnormal behaviour\
    \ of the crop.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n20 of 25\n(A)\n(B)\n(C)\nFigure 8. Maize\
    \ crop. (A) Optical image; (B) spectral image; (C) NDVI mapping.\n7. Challenges\n\
    PA has been used since the last few decades to enhance crops’ yield with reduced\
    \ costs and\nhuman effort, although the adoption of these novel techniques by\
    \ farmers is still very limited owing to\nthe following reasons or challenges.\n\
    7.1. Hardware Cost\nPA relies mostly on hardware such as sensors, wireless nodes,\
    \ drones, spectral imaging sensors,\netc., which are used to assess multiple parameters\
    \ in real time. These sensors have multiple limitations\nincluding high development,\
    \ maintenance and deployment cost. Some systems in PA are cost effective\nand\
    \ are suitable for small arable land, i.e., smart irrigation systems that require\
    \ low-cost hardware\ncomponents and sensors. However, drone-based systems for\
    \ crops’ health monitoring are feasible for\nlarge arable land due to high installation\
    \ cost.\n7.2. Weather Variations\nEnvironmental variation is one of the major\
    \ challenges that affects the accuracy of data collected\nby sensors. Sensor nodes\
    \ deployed in the ﬁeld are sensitive to environmental variations, i.e., rain,\n\
    ﬂuctuation in temperature, wind speed, sun light, etc. Communication between wireless\
    \ nodes\nand the cloud can be interrupted due interference induced in wireless\
    \ communication channels by\natmospheric disturbance. The satellite, air borne\
    \ and drone platforms are also sensitive to weather\nvariations. Imagery acquired\
    \ by these platforms is affected by contamination of clouds and other\nnatural\
    \ aerosols. The development of advanced techniques for atmospheric correction,\
    \ cloud detection\nand noise interpolation is a current open challenge, which\
    \ requires hard efforts from the research\ncommunity.\n7.3. Data Management\n\
    The sensors in PA constantly generate data. To ensure the integrity of data, some\
    \ data security\nmeasures needs to be in place, which will in turn enhance the\
    \ cost of the system. The readings from\nthe sensors have to be accurate in order\
    \ to take appropriate actions precisely when and where required.\nAn intruder\
    \ can corrupt the readings, and false readings will adversely reduce the effectiveness\
    \ of\nthe system. PA systems generate immense amounts of data, which require enough\
    \ resources to\nperform data analysis. Real-time data collected from sensors deployed\
    \ across the ﬁelds after a few\nminutes and spectral imagery acquired from high-altitude\
    \ or low-altitude platforms produce the bulk\nof the data, which increase the\
    \ storage and processing requirements. New software platforms and\nfacilities\
    \ for scalable management of Big Data sources are demanded. In this regard, the\
    \ generation\nof software-as-a-service solutions is focused on merging data management\
    \ and IoT thorough cloud\ncomputing platforms.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n21 of\
    \ 25\n7.4. Literacy Rate\nLiteracy is an important factor that inﬂuences the adoption\
    \ ratio in PA. In developing countries\nwhere the illiteracy rate is high, farmers\
    \ grow crops based on their experience. They do not utilize the\nstate-of-the-art\
    \ technologies in agriculture, which results in loss of production. Farmers need\
    \ to be\neducated in order to understand the technology or they have to trust\
    \ a third party for technical support.\nTherefore, in underdeveloped areas where\
    \ the literacy rate is not high, PA is not very common due to\nthe limitations\
    \ of resources and education.\n7.5. Connectivity\nNext-generation 5G networks\
    \ can be 100-times faster than 4G ones, making communication\nbetween devices\
    \ and servers much quicker. 5G can also carry much more data than other networks,\n\
    which makes it an ideal technology for transmitting information from remote sensors\
    \ and drones, key\ntools that are being tested in PA environments. The adoption\
    \ of new communication networks based\non 5G is a must in current applications\
    \ where secure and rapid data transfer enables real-time data\nmanagement and\
    \ support for decision making.\n7.6. Interoperability\nOne of the biggest problems\
    \ PA faces is the interoperability of equipment due to different digital\nstandards.\
    \ This lack of interoperability is not only obstructing the adoption of new IoT\
    \ technologies\nand slowing down their growth, but it also inhibits the gain of\
    \ production efﬁciency through smart\nagriculture applications. New methods and\
    \ protocols to integrate different machine communication\nstandards to unlock\
    \ the potential of efﬁcient machine-to-machine communication and data sharing\n\
    between machines and management information systems are required in the current\
    \ scenario of PA.\n8. Conclusion and Future Directions\nPrecision agriculture\
    \ is a modern practice used to enhance crops’ productivity using latest\ntechnologies,\
    \ i.e., WSN, IoT, cloud computing, Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning\n\
    (ML). Most of the research done so far indicates that PA-based practices have\
    \ a great inﬂuence on\nsustainability and productivity. The objective of PA is\
    \ to provide decision support systems based\non multiple parameters of crops,\
    \ i.e., soil nutrients, water level of the soil, wind speed, intensity of\nsunlight,\
    \ temperature, humidity, chlorophyll content, etc. However, several challenges\
    \ are involved\nin the development and deployment phase of these systems. This\
    \ article was aimed at providing a\nsurvey of modern technologies involving current\
    \ PA platforms, with the goal of supporting industry\nand research communities\
    \ on the development of modern applications for smart agriculture. A case\nstudy\
    \ was presented to prove the effectiveness of the PA in the agriculture domain.\n\
    Since the main objective of precision agriculture is to produce surplus yield\
    \ by optimizing the\nresources such as water, pesticides, fertilizers, etc., for\
    \ resource optimization, prescription maps play\nan important role, which enables\
    \ farmers to quantify resources required for healthy crops at any\nparticular\
    \ growth stage. Most of the research accomplished in the agriculture domain focuses\
    \ on the\nremote sensing platforms to collect imagery, which reﬂects only Vegetation\
    \ Indices (VIs) such as NDVI.\nThe prescription maps cannot be generated by only\
    \ using VIs; instead, multiple other factors need to\nbe considered such as soil\
    \ properties, soil moisture level, meteorological behaviour, etc.\nFunding: This\

    \ (AI)\n1. Introduction\nPrecision agriculture (PA) is a management strategy for\
    \ addressing geographical\nand temporal variabilities in agricultural ﬁelds [1–3]\
    \ that involves data and contempo-\nrary technologies. With a forecasted human\
    \ population of between 9 and 10 billion by\n2050 [3–5], precision agriculture\
    \ is becoming more and more important to contemporary\nagricultural research.\
    \ By 2050, the amount of food produced worldwide must grow by at\nleast 70% [1,5–7].\
    \ This is a difﬁcult endeavor [4] because it puts further strain on already-\n\
    scarce resources and the environment [1–3]. Therefore, precision agriculture is\
    \ essential\nto maximize output while using fewer inputs of all sorts in more\
    \ effective ways, reducing\nadverse impacts on the environment, and assuring sustainability\
    \ [2,3]. Precision farming\nwas born with the introduction of GPSs (global positioning\
    \ systems), GISs (geographic in-\nformation systems), yield monitors, and other\
    \ data generators in all three crucial phases of\nagricultural operations in the\
    \ 1990s [2,8,9]. In precision agriculture, motorized equipment\nwas only used\
    \ for performing agricultural processes [2,10], and the problem-recognizing\n\
    and decision-making steps were authorized by humans. The technological advancement\n\
    during the Third Industrial Revolution, known as Industry 3.0 [8], led precision\
    \ agriculture\nto digitalization by integrating information technologies and improved\
    \ automation capa-\nbilities in precision farming. As a result of this digitalization,\
    \ “farm practices” with manual\ntools moved to “agriculture” from animal traction,\
    \ then to motorized mechanization, and\nnow to digital equipment [2].\nPrecision\
    \ agriculture so far mainly consists of variable rate technologies (VRTs), elec-\n\
    tronic maps, yield monitors, and guidance farming systems [2,8]. Variable rate\
    \ applications\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593. https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture13081593\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/agriculture\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n2 of 26\n\
    were ﬁrstly demonstrated in northern Germany and Denmark in 1988 after global\
    \ posi-\ntioning systems (GPSs) were available for civil services [11]. GPS services\
    \ were opened\nfor general use in U.S. farms in 1983 [2]. In the next decade,\
    \ GPS technology facilitated\nfarmers to precisely locate and map their ﬁelds\
    \ [10,12], empowering them to manage their\nfarmlands according to site-speciﬁc\
    \ conditions and ﬁeld variabilities. At the beginning\nof the second millennium,\
    \ yield monitors were developed, enabling farmers to monitor\ncrop yield in real-time\
    \ via best matching [13]. Advancement of remote-sensing technology,\nsuch as satellites,\
    \ drones, ground-based sensors, and crews, authorized farmers to collect\nhigh-resolution\
    \ data on their ﬁelds, allowing them to make informed decisions about\ncrop management\
    \ [3]. Precision agriculture is not only focused on crop farming but also\non\
    \ other agricultural production systems: agronomics, livestock farming, aquaculture,\n\
    and agroforestry [2,3,9,14].\nIn the current status of precision agriculture,\
    \ there are several issues, such as un-\nsustainable resource utilization, long-term\
    \ monoculture, intensive animal farming [8],\nenvironmental compromises, uneven\
    \ distribution of digitization [15], food safety issues,\ninefﬁcient agri-food\
    \ supply chain [13,16], and lack of awareness of and inertia toward novel\nchanges.\
    \ These issues prevent achieving efﬁciency, productivity, and sustainability from\n\
    agricultural production and escalate unintended impacts on ecosystems [17]. The\
    \ fourth\nindustrial revolution, which is known as Industry 4.0, occurred in 2011\
    \ with the Internet of\nThings (IoT), big data, artiﬁcial intelligence (AI), robotics,\
    \ and blockchain technology [8,18].\nIn 2017, these advanced technologies were\
    \ integrated into agriculture in order to over-\ncome the above-mentioned issues,\
    \ transforming precision agriculture to Agriculture 4.0,\nor smart farming [8,16].\
    \ With this transition, there is a growing focus on sustainability\nin agriculture,\
    \ with many farmers adopting precision agricultural technologies to reduce\nthe\
    \ environmental impacts of farming and promote long-term sustainability. As a\
    \ result,\nagricultural-manufacturing processes and supply chains have become\
    \ more autonomous\nand intelligent [18], including the automation of various tasks\
    \ such as planting, seeding,\nharvesting, and soil sampling. This is making farming\
    \ more efﬁcient while reducing\nlabor costs.\nSmart agriculture is an evolving\
    \ ﬁeld that leverages technological innovations to\ntransform traditional farming\
    \ practices. The integration of digital technologies into agricul-\nture has opened\
    \ up new opportunities and possibilities, revolutionizing the way farmers\nmanage\
    \ their crops, resources, and operations. It is a rapidly evolving ﬁeld that encom-\n\
    passes a wide array of approaches, applications, and impacts. The broader objective\
    \ of\nthis review is to delve into the essential aspects of precision agriculture,\
    \ exploring its key\ncomponents and highlighting its potential for sustainable\
    \ farming practices. One of the\ncritical aspects of precision agriculture is\
    \ data collection and acquisition planning, which\nplays a fundamental role in\
    \ optimizing farm management decisions. Through efﬁcient data\ngathering, farmers\
    \ can make informed choices regarding crop health, resource allocation,\nand yield\
    \ optimization. Decision making and execution are also vital components of preci-\n\
    sion agriculture, where the integration of cutting-edge technologies is pivotal.\
    \ Leveraging\nmachine vision technology, the Internet of Things (IoT), and artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence (AI) can\nlead to enhanced precision and efﬁciency in agricultural\
    \ processes, beneﬁting both farmers\nand the environment. Throughout this review,\
    \ successful precision agriculture proposals\nand real-world implementations are\
    \ analyzed to gain insights into their achievements and\nchallenges. By identifying\
    \ future developments required in precision agriculture, we aim\nto provide a\
    \ comprehensive understanding of how this ﬁeld can continually evolve to\nsupport\
    \ sustainable farming practices and address global food security challenges. The\n\
    amalgamation of scientiﬁc research and technological innovations holds great promise\
    \ for\nthe future of precision agriculture and its positive impact on agriculture\
    \ and society as\na whole.\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n3 of 26\n2. Precision\
    \ Agriculture Approaches, Applications, and Impacts\nPrecision agriculture involves\
    \ data-driven management decisions that improve re-\nsource use efﬁciency, resulting\
    \ in reduced agricultural costs while lowering the environ-\nmental impacts from\
    \ agriculture [19]. Hence, data and data collection systems, decision\nsupport\
    \ tools, and data-driven equipment and input adjustments are major components\n\
    of precision agriculture [2], engaging in three key agricultural steps: diagnosis,\
    \ decision\nmaking, and performing [20], respectively. Before the integration\
    \ of smart technologies,\nICT (information and communication technology) was incorporated\
    \ into agricultural de-\nvices and machinery to capture real data. Here, remote\
    \ sensing, automated hardware and\nsoftware, telematics, drones, autonomous vehicles,\
    \ GPSs, and robotic technologies were\nincorporated into agricultural practices.\
    \ As an example, the agro-tech company John Deere\nintroduced GPSs for tractors,\
    \ expecting increased yield and decreased input wastage [19].\nThe previous status\
    \ of precision agriculture before smart farming can be summarized\nas follows.\n\
    2.1. Data Collection and Acquisition\nData, data collection, and decision support\
    \ tools are important for the identiﬁcation\nand diagnosis of various aspects\
    \ in agriculture. In precision agriculture, data on individual\nﬁelds and crops\
    \ are gathered by observing, measuring, and sensing with different kinds of\n\
    sensors, yield and soil monitors, and remote-sensing tools, such as imaging from\
    \ drones,\ncrews, aircraft, or satellites [1–3,13]. Thus, “sensing” is a fundamental\
    \ management tool\nof precision agriculture [3,13], which is observing detailed\
    \ information and providing\ndata on climate conditions, soil conditions, fertilizer\
    \ requirements, water availability, pest\nand disease stresses, and other ﬁeld\
    \ parameters [3]. A range of sensors are used in preci-\nsion agriculture. Biomass\
    \ parameters are important in making decisions to monitor the\nfertilization and\
    \ caring for crops. Sensors for mass ﬂow and moisture content are com-\nponents\
    \ of yield monitors, together with a differential global positioning system (DGPS)\n\
    receiver. Properly calibrated yield monitors can generate accurate real-time information\
    \ for\ndecision making, such as underperforming areas leading to site-speciﬁc\
    \ crop fertilization\ndesigns [13]. Precision livestock farming uses sensors and\
    \ monitoring technology to collect\ndata on animal health and welfare, enabling\
    \ farmers to make informed decisions about\nfeed, waste, and other inputs with\
    \ improved efﬁciency and productivity. Colter position\nsensors combined with\
    \ ultrasonic soil surface sensors are employed in dynamic Colter\ndepth control\
    \ systems [3].\nRemote-sensing technologies, such as drones, crews, aircraft,\
    \ satellites, and other\nground-based sensors, are used to collect data on crops\
    \ and soil conditions [2,3]. Remote\nsensing supports the identiﬁcation of spatial\
    \ patterns of signatures of plants that are co-\nincidental with soil characteristics,\
    \ as well as pest or disease stresses [11]. Imagery is one\nkind of remote-sensing\
    \ data that can reveal ground truthing [2,3,11]. Previously, aircraft\nhave been\
    \ used not only for many farming imagery operations that generate data, but also\n\
    chemical- or fertilizer-spraying activities. Moreover, satellite images have been\
    \ available for\nfarm management for many years. As an example, the US-LANDSAT\
    \ satellites were avail-\nable for this purpose in 1970 [2]. Unmanned aerial vehicles\
    \ (UAVs) equipped with global\nnavigation satellite system (GNSS) technology have\
    \ been recently employed for mapping,\ngathering imagery data, land surveying,\
    \ crop spraying, and livestock monitoring [2,3].\nGeocoded sampling is a requisite\
    \ component of precision agriculture and ground truthing\nwhen spatial images\
    \ are used for decision making [11]. Real-time and cost-effective remote\nsensing,\
    \ such as LASSIE (low-altitude stationary surveillance instrumental equipment),\n\
    are crucial in precision agriculture, as it enables continuous and automatic recoding\
    \ of\nreal-time images of crops and soil with GIS reference [11]. This information\
    \ can be used to\nmake informed decisions about crop management resource allocation\
    \ [3].\nSensor data and other data associated with geospatial coordinates from\
    \ a global\nnavigation satellite system (GNSS) provide information to create maps,\
    \ especially yield\nmaps and soil maps for site-speciﬁc management decisions [2,3].\
    \ Yield maps are used\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n4 of 26\nto characterize ﬁeld\
    \ production quantitatively and qualitatively [21], which is crucial\nto make\
    \ management decisions. Analyzing variabilities depicted on maps enables the\n\
    identiﬁcation of factors that inﬂuence productivity, facilitating the implementation\
    \ of site-\nspeciﬁc ﬁeld management strategies [3]. Soil maps offer valuable insights\
    \ into the spatial\ndistribution of the physical and chemical properties within\
    \ a given ﬁeld [21], serving as\nindispensable decision-making tools in precision\
    \ agriculture [13]. This signiﬁcance stems\nfrom the fact that soil’s physical\
    \ and chemical characteristics, such as water availability,\nnutrient-holding\
    \ capacity, bulk density, porosity, nutrient availability, and topography,\ntypically\
    \ exert an inﬂuence on crop yield [21]. Weather and climate trends can also be\n\
    predicted using sensor data, which are important in all farming practices. Harvesting\
    \ time\nis an affecting factor of grain loss in paddy rice farming, which is also\
    \ able to be monitored\nwith data observation [1].\n2.2. Planning, Decision Making,\
    \ and Execution\nAfter creating decisions by analyzing gathered information, actions\
    \ are performed\naccording to the decisions created using data-driven equipment.\
    \ Most ﬁelds are not\nhomogenous in terms of soil and climate properties, as well\
    \ as diseases [22]. Conventional\nagriculture did not take this into account;\
    \ therefore, rigorous use of limited resources and\nexcess use of chemicals and\
    \ synthetic fertilizers resulted in unsustainable conventional\nagricultural practices.\
    \ This also drove lots of wastage, even in the amounts of resource\ninputs and\
    \ yield. Nonetheless, precision agriculture itself has proved that the application\n\
    of technologies to manage the spatial and temporal variabilities in agricultural\
    \ ﬁelds is\npossible to improve performance and environmental quality [9]. Variable\
    \ rate technologies\nin precision agriculture involve applying inputs such as\
    \ fertilizers, water and seeds, and\ncrop protection chemicals (pesticides and\
    \ weedicides) at varying rates, depending on the\nspeciﬁc needs of each area of\
    \ a ﬁeld [23]. In this approach, residual issues of chemicals, as\nwell as wastage\
    \ of input resources, can be reduced. Also, net proﬁt can be improved with\nincreased\
    \ crop yield and reduced input costs, as farmers can use resources according to\
    \ the\nﬁeld requirements rather than full-coverage application in ﬁelds at uniform\
    \ rates [2,24,25].\nAccording to the identiﬁed heterogeneity of a ﬁeld, amounts\
    \ of water, fertilizer, her-\nbicides, pesticides, and liming can be determined\
    \ and applied. When considering the\nirrigation practices in precision agriculture,\
    \ technology-driven, more sustainable smart\nirrigation systems are there to apply\
    \ precise amounts of water at precise times. When\nsoil moisture sensor data give\
    \ an estimation of a required amount of water, irrigation\nsystems can be diverted\
    \ into variable rate irrigation to apply irrigation water until mois-\nture content\
    \ returns to the ideal level [26]. Most of the time, these effective and efﬁcient\n\
    water management systems are automatically controlled, increasing irrigation water\
    \ use\nefﬁciency (IWUE). Monteiro et al. in 2021 described the use of satellite\
    \ LANDSAT data and\nremote-sensing data to develop a feasible operational irrigation\
    \ water model [3]. Likewise,\ntillage depth can be determined via matching with\
    \ variabilities of soil physical proper-\nties [27]. Chemical spraying and seeding\
    \ are also performed according to variable rate\napproaches. Previously, agricultural\
    \ aircraft were used for chemical spraying, where a\npilot controlled the spray\
    \ [23]. In the present, aircraft are employed with an auto-adjusting\nability\
    \ for the application rate of chemicals based on a prescription map, whilst UAVs\
    \ are\nalso used as fertilizer spreaders [3]. Precision seeding can control sowing\
    \ depth, densities,\nand distances effectively while saving seeds, time, and labor\
    \ costs. Studies estimated that\nprecision seeding based on variable rate technologies\
    \ was 10% to 30% more efﬁcient than\nconventional practices [3].\nThis site-speciﬁc\
    \ management increases the number of correct decisions per unit area\nper unit\
    \ time related to net beneﬁts [9] while supporting the conservation of agricultural\n\
    inputs and reducing costs together with environmental impacts [2,13,24]. Another\
    \ man-\nagement tool, grid sampling, also involves the division of ﬁelds into\
    \ a grid and collecting\ndata at each intersection of the grid. This approach\
    \ provides representative information\nof the entire variation within a ﬁeld [11],\

    3.1. Big Data\nPrecision agriculture systems are highly related to data and information\
    \ [5]. Gen-\nerally, unstructured and vast amounts of data are used by big business\
    \ industries, like\nsocial-networking sites, to learn or predict customer behaviors\
    \ accurately [4]. Similarly,\nin precision agriculture, big data analytics are\
    \ applied to understand data-intensive agri-\ncultural processes for decision\
    \ making [6], where analytic tools operate enormous data\nsets [4]. These analytic\
    \ tools consist of data mining, statistics, AI, predictive analytics,\nneural\
    \ language processing, etc. [4]. Big data science usually functions either with\
    \ ML,\ncloud computing, image processing, modeling and simulation, statistical\
    \ analysis, NDVI\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n7 of 26\nvegetation indices, or\
    \ GIS. These conjugations can discover correlations, patterns, and\ntrends from\
    \ large quantities of data via capturing, storing, exchanging, analyzing, and\n\
    marketing features of this high-performance informatics technology [6]. These\
    \ predictions\nand recommendations assist farmers with handling the upcoming outcomes,\
    \ risks, and\nchallenges in the agricultural industry [4]. Combining the data\
    \ in agricultural production\nprocesses creates traceability of product while\
    \ increasing product quality, including safety\nand taste. As customers are now\
    \ aware of the ecological footprint of agri-products, the\nabove combination supports\
    \ the increase in the demand for agricultural commodities [29],\nadding high market\
    \ value. Recent advancements of high-resolution remote sensing and\nintelligent\
    \ information and communication technologies, including social media (Facebook,\n\
    Twitter, Amazon, Instagram, etc.), have contributed to big data analytics in many\
    \ sectors,\nas well as in many stages in farming, including decision making, weather\
    \ forecasting,\nweather management, disaster management, smart management of resources,\
    \ disease and\npest interruption, and harvesting time predictions [4,6,30]. Moreover,\
    \ big data analytics\naid in implementing real-time forecasting in precision agriculture\
    \ [4]. However, data\nupdating, device security, correctness of data, accuracy\
    \ of data, availability of data, and\nsecurity elements, such as encryption, are\
    \ still barriers when combining big data with\nsmart farming [31]. Invalid data\
    \ can lead farmers to make costly, disruptive decisions\nand actions [5].\n3.2.\
    \ Machine Vision Technology\nPrecise and accurate data and information are the\
    \ driving components of precision\nagriculture. Recently, image analysis has become\
    \ a more reliable data source than man-\nual, labor-intensive, costly data-collecting\
    \ methods [22,32]. Here, machines can read and\nunderstand the real world through\
    \ pixel images and produce accurate site-speciﬁc informa-\ntion [31]. Machines\
    \ with ‘eyes’ in agricultural activities are called machine vision (MV). This,\n\
    also known as agro-vision or the ‘eyes’ of robots, provides non-destructive, robust,\
    \ rapid,\nand steady methods to monitor cultivation processes. MV systems give\
    \ machines their\nvision and judgement capabilities in image processing and data\
    \ extraction [10]. Although\nMV technologies have already been applied successfully\
    \ for crop species identiﬁcation,\ncrop stress detection, crop seed quality assessment,\
    \ weed detection, disease detection, etc.,\nthey are still at the prototype stage.\
    \ Currently, emerging deep-learning (DL) techniques in\ngrowing machine-learning\
    \ (ML) technologies are integrated with MV applications in order\nto develop intelligent\
    \ robots for multispectral imagery analysis and real-time analysis in\nﬁeld variable\
    \ rate applications [10,25]. Commercial smartphones, which are ubiquitous\namong\
    \ the human population, are able to be used in monitoring crop health and stress\n\
    based on MV systems [33].\n3.3. Internet of Things (IoT)\nThe IoT refers to a\
    \ network of interconnected items and technologies [16]. The IoT\nis one of the\
    \ most important technological advancements in precision agriculture and\nsmart\
    \ farming [5]. IoT architecture for agriculture, such as agricultural sensors\
    \ with\nICT and UAV, collects data for precision agriculture [31]. Also, the burgeoning\
    \ IoT and\nmobile data are the core of the fourth industrial revolution [10].\
    \ Meanwhile, advancements\nin communication technologies and wireless networks\
    \ (5G, LoRaWAN, NB-IoT, Sigfox,\nZigBee, and Wi-Fi) have broadened the application\
    \ of the IoT in diverse ﬁelds, such as\nreal-time remote control and high-throughput\
    \ phenotyping, while giving better coverage,\nbandwidth, connection density, and\
    \ end-to-end latency (Table 1) [8]. When it consolidates\nin agriculture together\
    \ with cloud computing, it results in smart farming [6] for various\nscopes of\
    \ livestock monitoring, smart greenhouses, ﬁshery management, and weather\ntracking\
    \ [8]. The IoT can be widely used in all areas of precision agriculture with the\n\
    development of sensors with independent intellectual property rights and the development\n\
    of smart devices, such as intelligent tractors, UAVs, and robots that can replace\

    \ data, which are then uploaded to cloud information support systems to man-\n\
    Agriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n9 of 26\nage [4,13,16,28]. Those sensors can directly\
    \ combine with agricultural robots, autonomous\nplatforms, machines, and weather\
    \ stations for real-time monitoring [4]. With the IoT, UAVs\ncan respond promptly,\
    \ leading to high-quality, high-resolution, and exceptionally reliable\nobservations\
    \ through high-throughput 3D monitoring at different geographical areas. At\n\
    the same time, various kinds of agricultural sensor nodes, autonomous farm vehicles,\
    \ and\nmobile crowd sensing have been put forward based on the IoT for ground\
    \ and undersurface\ncognition [8]. Most IoT sensors in precision agriculture are\
    \ in wireless frameworks [13] or\nlow-power wide-area networks [8] and, hence,\
    \ can be used for on-site analysis [3], as well\nas mass data transfer, without\
    \ any interruptions [29,31]. Still, there are cost, operational,\ntechnical, and\
    \ data management difﬁculties in implementing the IoT in agricultural opera-\n\
    tions [13]. Designing low-cost, energy-efﬁcient, wireless IoT technologies in\
    \ autonomous\napplications is affected by the following dependencies: data latency\
    \ on power consump-\ntion, data scalability on storage and processing cost, and\
    \ data interoperability on cloud\ncompatibility to store and process various kinds\
    \ of data [13].\nDifferent IoT devices are coalesced as networks to achieve high-speed\
    \ data exchang-\ning [4,30]. Therefore, the development of an IoT framework can\
    \ also solve problems with\nbig data [31]. With more advancements, agricultural\
    \ operations like protecting, controlling,\nmonitoring, and detecting can be extended\
    \ using smart phones with the IoT [25]. As an\nexample, time-consuming cattle\
    \ status monitoring has also beneﬁted from the IoT, allowing\nfarmers to monitor\
    \ the health and welfare of animals. Also, weed detection through MV\nprimarily\
    \ consists of deep learning (DL) and image processing [16].\nEdge computing enables\
    \ affordable real-time data transmission in IoT precision agri-\nculture, reducing\
    \ data package size and alleviating strain on centralized cloud resources.\nInternet\
    \ and communication companies leverage their expertise to extend cloud service\n\
    capabilities to edge networks, shaping the edge computing landscape. Pioneers\
    \ like Cisco\nand Huawei have developed comprehensive frameworks and lightweight\
    \ computing sys-\ntems. The IoT connects objects through smart technologies, while\
    \ research explores aerial\nedge–IoT systems for improved convergence speed and\
    \ task completion rates [39–42].\n3.4. Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning\
    \ (ML), and Deep Learning (DL)\nAI has a key role in robotics and autonomous systems\
    \ (RASs). The development of\nAI in the IoT has contributed continuous data streams\
    \ [31]. To make agricultural data into\nmeaningful information in decision-making\
    \ data, mining techniques are required. Various\nenvironmental data and farming\
    \ historical records in big data are analyzed using AI, which\nﬁnds patterns that\
    \ are hidden in big data [29]. These discoveries are important in the pest\nidentiﬁcation,\
    \ disease detection, yield prediction, and fertilizing plans [25,31] included\
    \ in\nagricultural decision support systems. AI has noteworthy potential to accommodate\
    \ the\nreduction of food wastage, the improvement of production hygiene, and the\
    \ monitoring\nof machines in many stages of agriculture, such as supply chain,\
    \ agricultural production\npattern, and agricultural production process including\
    \ soil, crop, and water management,\nas well as disease and pest control [4,8].\
    \ Then, AI has the potential to overcome problems\nin conventional farming [31].\n\
    Both ML and DL are subconcepts of AI (Figure 3) [10]. With ML, a computer learns\n\
    independently to improve the performance of AI, which goes through explicit feature\n\
    extraction [6]. ML focuses on the theory, performance, and properties of learning\
    \ systems\nand algorithms, as it is a high-performance informatics technology\
    \ for quantifying and\nunderstanding data-intensive farming processes [6]. On\
    \ the other hand, DL can solve\nproblems with combinations of layers and nonlinear\
    \ functions [10]. To address limitations\nin the practical implementation of robots,\

    \ and improve the opera-\ntional speeds of these systems [43]. This advancement\
    \ has wide-ranging applications, in-\ncluding accurate fruit and pest detection,\
    \ as well as the optimization and prediction of \ncomplex conditions in plant\
    \ tissue cultures and breeding processes [25,28,44]. Notably, a \nstudy (referenced\
    \ as study 13) successfully applied machine-learning models and artiﬁcial \nneural\
    \ multilayer regression models to enhance the in vitro regeneration of soybeans\
    \ by \ntracking simple, observable traits, such as shoot regeneration frequency\
    \ and shoot length. \n \nFigure 3. Major AI applications in diﬀerent practices\

    Also, machine-learning algorithms are employed for data validation, enabling a\
    \ deeper\nunderstanding of dynamic agricultural conditions through data collected\
    \ from various\nelements of modern agriculture [6,44]. Despite these advancements,\
    \ challenges remain\nin terms of processing speed and the development of efﬁcient\
    \ information visualization\nsystems for farmers when dealing with big data [6].\
    \ Nonetheless, continued research in\nthe ﬁelds of big data, the IoT, machine\
    \ learning, and deep learning holds great potential in\novercoming these roadblocks\
    \ and providing accurate predictions of the dynamic nature\nof agriculture while\
    \ identifying new opportunities [1]. Supervised machine-learning\ntechniques,\
    \ such as support vector machines, decision trees, k-means, random forests,\n\
    genetic algorithms, deep learning, and fuzzy logic, are several categories of\
    \ machine-\nlearning models (Figure 3) that play a vital role in agricultural\
    \ automation, augmenting\nthe intelligence of other technologies, such as smartphones,\
    \ unmanned aerial vehicles,\nunmanned ground vehicles, satellite systems, automated\
    \ machines, agricultural robots,\nand big data analytics [1,28,31].\nMobile applications\
    \ have signiﬁcantly diverted from these AI, ML, DL, and MV\ntechnologies [10].\
    \ ML algorithms in big data are also critically essential because this\nintegration\
    \ can learn from data to create decisions, data-based prospects, and predictions.\n\
    Due to the intricate input data requirements of machine learning (ML) and deep\
    \ learning\n(DL), the initial stage of adopting ML models in precision agriculture\
    \ may encounter\nsigniﬁcant obstacles in terms of the time and cost involved in\
    \ gathering the necessary data\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n11 of 26\nfrom commercial\
    \ farms [1,6,30]. However, with the continuous advancement of IoT sensors,\nAI-based\
    \ autonomous machines or robots together with cloud computing, edge computing,\n\
    and blockchain can support overcoming this difﬁculty during the transforming,\
    \ storing,\nand processing of data in the creation of ML models [27,36,41]. Accordingly,\
    \ ML is able to be\nused to solve diverse issues in agriculture related to yield\
    \ prediction, crop quality, disease\ndetection, weed detection, species identiﬁcation,\
    \ animal welfare, livestock production,\nwater management, and soil management\
    \ [6,45]. Common principles of ML techniques\nare clustering, decision trees,\
    \ instance-based models, regression, artiﬁcial and deep neural\nnetworks, ensemble\
    \ learning, support vector machines, and Bayesian models [6]. A study\nproved\
    \ that ML was a powerful tool for analyzing data to monitor inputs and outputs\n\
    aiming to optimize plant tissue culture protocols [44].\nSmart farming is technology\
    \ that relies on its implementation with the use of AI and\nthe IoT in cyber-physical\
    \ farm management [28]. According to current applications, AI has\nbeen involved\
    \ in soil management, crop management, disease management, weed control,\netc.\
    \ Examples are the fuzzy-logic-based soil risk characterization decision support\
    \ system\n(SRCDSS), management-oriented modeling (MOM), artiﬁcial neural networks\
    \ (ANNs),\nCALEX, PROLOG, computer vision systems, ANN-GIS, invasive weed optimization\
    \ (IWO),\nand support vector machines [4]. One key application of AI is a mobile\
    \ expert system\nwhere farmers can use their smartphones for disease diagnosis,\
    \ species identiﬁcation, and\nsoil health analysis with the help of mobile apps.\
    \ In addition, AI is a real-time analyzer of\nsatellite images when the progress\
    \ of farming is tracked with satellite imagery [24]. With AI\napplications, precision\
    \ agriculture now has a scientiﬁc background, which helps to make\nprecision agriculture\
    \ more formalized to perform optimal agriculture outputs [29]. In the\nfuture,\
    \ AI may be improved to deal with the dynamic nature of agricultural microclimates,\n\
    as it is now facing difﬁculties ﬁnding a single standard solution for that heterogeneity.\n\
    The existing experience gap between AI researchers and farmers hinders the complete\n\
    understanding of agricultural problems and solutions. To eliminate this obstacle,\
    \ the\nknowledge of farmers, agricultural professionals, and AI researchers should\
    \ be linked.\nIn spite of this, accessibility and privacy protection problems\
    \ when working with huge\namounts of data should be addressed to deliver more\
    \ skillful AI [8,16].\n3.5. Guidance Systems\nGuidance systems use GPS (global\
    \ positioning system) technology to provide farmers\nwith real-time information\
    \ about their equipment locations and herd-grazing locations,\nenabling them to\
    \ optimize ﬁeld operations such as planting, harvesting, and herding [1,12].\n\
    The limited number of satellites, poor signal strengths, and lack of reliable\
    \ connectivity\nwere overcome by introducing a GNSS (global navigation satellite\
    \ system), which then re-\nplaced labor-intensive, time-consuming farm operations\
    \ with more effective methods, such\nas VRA [11,31]. Previously, agricultural\
    \ inputs were performed manually, and during Agri-\nculture 3.0, they were performed\
    \ mechanically using digitalized machines [2]. With rapid\ncommercialization,\
    \ agricultural machinery services have emerged that require efﬁcient\nmanagement\
    \ to prevent overuse or underuse issues. For the understanding of agricultural\n\
    machinery, GNSS plays a crucial role in optimizing effectivity and efﬁciency [46].\
    \ The\nnew trend of GNSS-enabled devices in the fully automated steering of tractions\
    \ is saving\ntime, labor costs, and money [2]. Precision agricultural robots require\
    \ high-resolution\nnavigation solutions [47]. Similarly, agricultural rovers and\
    \ robots are effective only when\nprecisely guided in their actions [45]. Some\
    \ studies introduced DL propagation models in\nGNSS fused with inertial navigation\
    \ data sets for precision agriculture [47]. One example\nis electric seeders with\
    \ optical ﬁber detection technology that were developed and tested\nsuccessfully\
    \ [3]. The new development of software-based farm management solutions\nfor GIS\
    \ encourage the automation of data collection and analysis of supervising, storing,\n\
    decision making, and farm management.\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n12 of 26\n\
    3.6. Blockchain Technology\nBlockchain is deﬁned as a decentralized, distributed\
    \ database that maintains a con-\ntinuously growing list of ordered records or\
    \ blocks, which was ﬁrst used in cryptocur-\nrency [15,48]. Blockchain offers\
    \ data transparency, immutability, and reliability, which\nimprove the mutual\
    \ trust between various parties in the supply chain [15]. As this technol-\nogy\
    \ eliminates the obstacles of corporations, this was introduced to precision agriculture,\n\
    increasing the easiness of the integration of digital technologies into agriculture.\
    \ This step\nprovides solutions to some technical challenges in smart farming,\
    \ furnishing the remote\nmonitoring and controlling of farm equipment through\
    \ the “IoT applied Greenhouse Moni-\ntoring System” [15,48]. One such challenge\
    \ is an insufﬁcient and insecure infrastructure for\ndata sharing. Another challenge\
    \ is the delay of remote-sensing satellites in detecting the\nvariability of croplands.\
    \ Therefore, as a solution for the above decentralization, anonymity,\nand security\
    \ problems in the IoT in smart farming, blockchain has been proposed, expect-\n\
    ing lightweight, distributed, decentralized, and transparent security and privacy\
    \ [5,48].\nBlockchain can assist with having a reliable, faster, and secure platform\
    \ to monitor farm\noperations, although it is still in its early stages of maturity\
    \ [15,48]. As information can be\ncommunicated securely in a distributed network\
    \ [48], with the help of blockchain this can\nimprove the planning of schedules\
    \ for various agricultural processes, such as irrigation\nwater sharing, energy\
    \ consumption, the incorporation of machines and labors, and tasks\nfor robot\
    \ coalitions and autonomous UAVs [15,28]. Especially in the food supply chain,\n\
    this is a crucial point because of food safety issues, as well as asymmetric and\
    \ fragmented\ninformation occurring related to the insufﬁcient supply chain [1,8,10].\n\
    3.7. Robotics and Autonomous Systems\nMost recently, autonomous farming has involved\
    \ a high degree of the use of robotics,\nsensors, drones, and remote sensing to\
    \ perform various agricultural tasks, such as planting,\nspraying, harvesting,\
    \ and weeding, while reducing labor costs and improving efﬁcient\ndecision making\
    \ [3,45]. RASs are a combination of emerging modern technologies that have\nkey\
    \ applications in both agricultural production processes and production patterns.\
    \ Mobile\nrobots equipped with various sensors, actuators, and ML algorithms are\
    \ key enablers to\nautomatically handle variability and uncertainty in farming\
    \ practices [47]. Key applications\nof RAS in agricultural patterns are in plant\
    \ factories, 3D food printing, and biodiverse\nfarming, whereas autonomous farming,\
    \ aerial monitoring, and automated husbandry\nhave become new applications in\
    \ agricultural production processes [8]. However, agricul-\ntural RASs are required\
    \ to be improved to fulﬁll efﬁcient work with accurate guidance,\nautonomous navigation,\
    \ and accurate detection of dynamic agricultural environments\n(changing appearances,\
    \ growth stages, weather conditions, object overlapping, etc.). Intelli-\ngent\
    \ actions, such as robot-assisted plant phenotyping, fruit counting, fruit harvesting,\
    \ fruit\ncounting, leaf peeling, selective spraying, and 3D mapping, are demonstrated\
    \ and currently\nemployed applications of RASs [8]. Auto-steered agricultural\
    \ vehicles are also used in\nmany ﬁeld operations [3], such as tilling, planting,\
    \ chemical applications, and harvesting.\nThese machines, like harvesters, sprayers,\
    \ tractors, planters, and mechanical weed controls,\nuse guidance systems either\
    \ with light bars [13] or a GNSS [2,20]. These guidance systems\nvisualize the\
    \ positions of equipment to prevent skips and overlaps, which is important in\n\
    variable rate applications.\n3.8. Artiﬁcial Satellites, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles\
    \ (UAVs), and Unmanned Ground\nVehicles (UGVs)\nArtiﬁcial satellites, such as\
    \ American Landsat satellites, the European Sentinel-2 Sys-\ntem, the RapidEye\
    \ constellation satellite system, the GeoEye-1 system, and WorldView-3,\nfor remote\
    \ sensing help to generate remotely accessible data in multispectral forms [8].\n\
    The establishment of these intelligent remote-sensing satellites has provided\
    \ full coverage\nfor collecting agricultural information [8,31,49]. More recently,\
    \ ubiquitous and affordable\ntechnologies such as drones, crews, and aircraft\
    \ have allowed images to be captured closer\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n13 of\
    \ 26\nto the ground and at a higher frequency, increasing detail and functionality\
    \ [45]. UGVs ac-\nquire high-resolution data for weed identiﬁcation and control,\
    \ selective pesticide spraying,\nsoil analysis, and crop scouting, while scouting\
    \ robots accomplish speciﬁc targets [49] such\nas mechanical weeding (Oz robot),\
    \ spraying (GUSS autonomous sprayer), fertilizing, map-\nping, and seeding (RowBot\
    \ system), as well as vineyard management (VineRobots) [4,50].\nInformation, including\
    \ imagery data generated by satellites, UAVs, and UGVs, is the\nparamount thing\
    \ in precision agriculture, as it supports vegetation patch identiﬁcation,\nweed\
    \ recognition, pest attack detection, observation of environmental stresses, and\
    \ accurate\nclassiﬁcation in VRT [18,45]. Not only that, in other agricultural\
    \ disciplines, such as aqua-\nculture, agroforestry, and forestry, imagery data\
    \ play a considerable role because they can\ncover large areas when gathering\
    \ information, and these data are reproducible [20]. Data\nfrom satellites, UAVs,\
    \ and UGVs are supported by detailed ground survey data processed\nwith ML and\
    \ DL algorithms in order to make them usable and meaningful information [18].\n\
    For example, in forestry, determining forest densities is labor-intensive and\
    \ time-\nconsuming, although it is an important parameter when combatting climate\
    \ change. Re-\ncently, data of tree type distribution could be achieved over a\
    \ wide area of forest with the\nhelp of hyperspectral images and NDVI and RGB\
    \ images from UAVs such as Sentinel-\n2 [13,16]. Likewise, in remote sensing satellites\
    \ and drones play a big role in monitoring\ndeforestation and obtaining accurate\
    \ coverage of vegetative types and classiﬁcation of\ntree species and are more\
    \ effective than other UAV or LiDAR data [14,34]. Although there\nare limitations,\
    \ drone and remotely piloted aircraft usage is dramatically increasing while\n\
    providing precise information for precision agriculture through hyperspectral\
    \ sensors,\nmultispectral cameras, and other novel technologies [14]. This is\
    \ a cost-effective, promising\nmethod for monitoring large-scale farms or crop\
    \ lands [4], as well as forest areas [14].\n3.9. High-throughput Phenotyping\n\
    High-throughput phenotyping has emerged as a promising approach to enhance\nprecision\
    \ agriculture by allowing the rapid and accurate measurement of plant traits [51]\n\
    quantitatively and qualitatively [22,52]. Accurate and high-throughput plant phenotyping\n\
    is important for accelerating crop breeding [52]. This technique uses advanced\
    \ technologies\nsuch as remote sensing [40,42], spectral imaging [41], and robotics\
    \ [53] to collect large\namounts of data on plant characteristics, such as growth\
    \ rate, yield, disease resistance, and\nmorphology [51,54,55]. By collecting and\
    \ analyzing these data, farmers can gain insights\ninto how their crops are performing\
    \ and make more informed decisions about things like\nfertilization, irrigation,\
    \ harvesting, and pest management [22,54]. High-throughput pheno-\ntyping can\
    \ also help breeders to develop new crop varieties that are better adapted to\
    \ local\ngrowing conditions and can produce higher yields (Figure 4) [51]. A full\
    \ range of visible\nand near-infrared hyperspectral data enables ML techniques\
    \ such as LSR (least squares\nregression) to predict speciﬁc biochemical and physicochemical\
    \ traits beyond simple vege-\ntative indices [56]. ML-based precision agriculture\
    \ systems have AI background [52,54],\nand therefore, when detecting diseases,\
    \ pests, nutrient deﬁciency, and weeds, stressed\nresponses are detected using\
    \ high-quality images generated with UGV or UAV remote\nsensing, hyperspectral\
    \ imaging, and satellite imaging to support high-throughput pheno-\ntyping [57].\
    \ Ultimately, high-throughput phenotyping has the potential to revolutionize\n\
    agriculture by enabling more the precise, real-time, and efﬁcient monitoring of\
    \ farming\npractices that can improve crop productivity, reduce environmental\
    \ impacts, and increase\nfood security [54].\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n14 of\

    \ satellite imaging to support \nhigh-throughput phenotyping [57]. Ultimately,\

    \ by enabling more the precise, real-time, and eﬃcient \nmonitoring of farming\
    \ practices that can improve crop productivity, reduce environmen-\ntal impacts,\
    \ and increase food security [54]. \n \nFigure 4. Importance of high-throughput\
    \ phenotyping in agriculture. \nThe traditional methods of plant breeding have\
    \ limitations in terms of time, cost, and \naccuracy. HTP, on the other hand,\
    \ uses nondestructive and rapid methods to gather data \non a large number of\
    \ plants, allowing breeders to identify traits of interest more eﬃciently \n[58].\
    \ A study by Yang et al. (2017) [59] described using high-throughput phenotyping\
    \ \n(HTP) and quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping to investigate the genetic\
    \ architecture \nof maize plant growth. The authors collected data on various\
    \ traits related to plant growth, \nsuch as plant height, leaf area, and biomass,\
    \ using HTP techniques, such as imaging and \nspectroscopy [59]. Unmanned aerial\
    \ systems (UASs) have brought about a revolutionary \nchange in ﬁeld high-throughput\
    \ phenotyping by providing a platform for diﬀerent sen-\nsors to collect remote-sensing\
    \ data in ﬁeld-scale trials. These sensors include regular RGB \ncameras, multispectral-imaging\
    \ cameras, hyperspectral-imaging cameras, thermal-imag-\ning sensors, and light\
    \ detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors that enable the nondestruc-\ntive estimation\
    \ of plant traits, such as yield, biomass, height, and leaf area index. This is\
    \ a \nsigniﬁcant advancement in agriculture, allowing for the high-throughput\

    \ the frequency and through-\nput for phenotyping, while being cost-eﬀective and\
    \ providing high-resolution images as \ncompared to satellite-based techniques.\
    \ The phenotypic traits can be used to select crops \nwith high yield and strong\
    \ stress resistance, such as disease and salt resistance, ultimately \nleading\
    \ to improved production [60]. \nAs technology advances, the future of high-throughput\

    \ Evaluating the capabilities of 5G and 6G networks, including\ncurrent and future\
    \ support, is essential for identifying use cases and the requirements in\nthese\

    \ Successful Precision Agriculture Proposals and Implementations\nThe article\
    \ [63] reviewed advancements in automated fruit-harvesting robots for\nsweet peppers\
    \ and apples, highlighting the successful implementation of a sweet-pepper-\n\
    harvesting robot called ‘Harvey’, which effectively addressed detection, grasp\
    \ selection,\nand manipulation challenges. Similarly, the apple-harvesting robot\
    \ utilized a picking\nmanipulator and a catching manipulator, along with machine\
    \ vision and prioritization algo-\nrithms, for efﬁcient harvesting. The article\
    \ emphasized interdisciplinary collaboration for\nfurther advancements in automated\
    \ harvesting systems and the importance of intelligent\nsystems like deep learning\
    \ and crop management software for enhancing productivity and\nsustainability\
    \ in modern agriculture. Field trials were conducted with Harvey for sweet\npeppers\
    \ in Australia, while robotic picking systems for apples were tested in a Washing-\n\
    ton orchard in the U.S. [64,65]. Israel has successfully implemented autonomous\
    \ robotic\ntechnology in their crop ﬁelds, paving the way for the commercial use\
    \ of AI harvesters.\nTevel Aerobotics Technologies developed an autonomous fruit-picking\
    \ system that utilized\nﬂying robots tethered to an autonomous vehicle, enabling\
    \ accurate fruit picking, extended\nwork hours, and additional tasks like tree\

    industry. Tevel plans to introduce its innovative solution to the global market,\
    \ catering to\nfruit farmers worldwide and contributing to the growing agricultural\
    \ robotics sector [66].\nSenapathy et al. introduced the IoTSNA-CR model from\
    \ their study, which leveraged\nIoT technology to classify soil nutrients and\
    \ provide crop recommendations, aiming to\noptimize fertilizer usage and maximize\
    \ productivity for farmers. The implementation of\nAI harvesters in Israel showcases\
    \ the potential of artiﬁcial intelligence, machine learning,\ncloud services,\
    \ sensors, and automation for delivering real-time information and support\nto\
    \ farmers. The proposed IoTSNA-CR model incorporated IoT sensors, cloud storage,\n\
    machine-learning techniques, and an optimized algorithm (MSVM-DAG-FFO) to achieve\n\
    high accuracy in soil analysis. The model allowed farmers to maintain soil information\

    \ updates, and alerts,\naiming to further streamline the organic fertilizer-mixing\
    \ process. A harvesting robot\nsystem for cherry tomatoes in greenhouses was developed\
    \ by the Beijing Research Center\nof Intelligent Equipment for Agriculture. This\
    \ new harvesting robot system for cherry\ntomatoes was designed featuring a railed-type\
    \ vehicle, a visual servo unit, a manipulator,\nand picking end-effectors. Field\
    \ tests demonstrated an average picking time of 12 s per\nbunch of tomatoes with\
    \ a success rate of 83% [69]. Also, X. Jin et al. [70] designed a small-\nsized\
    \ vegetable seed electric seeder with power drive and optical ﬁber detection technology,\n\
    providing high efﬁciency and precision by monitoring sowing conditions in real-time\
    \ for\ndifferent seed sizes (Table 2).\nThe Cooperative Heterogeneous Robots for\
    \ Autonomous Insects Trap Monitoring\nSystem experiment in Portugal proposed a\
    \ cooperative UAS and UGV system for olive\ngrove inspection that veriﬁed the\
    \ feasibility and robustness of the multiple-cooperative\nrobot architecture in\
    \ an olive inspection scenario [49]. Russian researchers Filipe et al. [7]\nproposed\
    \ an approach for dynamic robot coalition that combined fuzzy coalition games\n\
    and smart contracts to form a dynamic and trusted coalition. It enabled the collection\n\
    and dissemination of information from robot sensors in a shared space. Integration\
    \ of the\nIoT with blockchain allows the continuous tracking of food in precision\
    \ agriculture tasks,\nensuring transparency and veriﬁcation at each stage. Precision\
    \ agriculture is a strategy that\nuses advanced technologies, like sensors, remote\
    \ sensing, and data analytics, to improve\nagricultural management decisions and\
    \ increase productivity, proﬁtability, and sustainabil-\nity. Machine-learning\
    \ models have been integrated with IoT sensors to develop intelligent\nsensors\
    \ for generating of big amount of data. In the study of Smolka et al. [71], a\
    \ microchip\ncapillary electrophoresis sensor was used for soil nutrient analysis,\
    \ demonstrating its gen-\neral sensitivity to ions in liquids, particularly NO3,\
    \ NH4, K, and PO4. The sensor exhibited\nstrong linearity and detected important\
    \ plant nutrients, which could contribute to future\ndevelopments in digital agriculture.\
    \ Insufﬁcient power infrastructure is one obstacle in\nadapting novel technologies\
    \ in agricultural ﬁelds. Researchers successfully developed an\nIoT-based solar-energy-powered\
    \ smart farm irrigation system in the United Arab Emirates\nthat harvested renewable\
    \ energy for smart farm irrigation [72]. This study outcome paved\nthe way to\
    \ developing three operation modes that are available for farmers’ use.\nVRT is\
    \ a major constituent in precision agriculture that deploys ﬁeld maps, GPSs, and\n\
    GNSSs to establish the precision of input applications. A study of a data fusion\
    \ method\nfor yield and soil sensor maps [21] evaluated fusion results on ﬁelds,\
    \ highlighting their\nusefulness in decision support for drainage, irrigation,\
    \ and variable yield goals. It un-\ncovered hidden areas of lost yield potential\
    \ using soil sensing, EC, pH, organic matter,\nand topography data fusion. Researchers\
    \ in Beijing, China, developed a new method\nusing image segmentation and pixel-level\
    \ visual features to accurately classify ﬁeld and\nroad areas in GNSS recordings\
    \ of agricultural machinery, surpassing existing methods\nand demonstrating a\
    \ superior performance for high-frequency GNSS trajectories [46]. A\nmultisensor\
    \ data fusion approach was used by Whattoff et al. for creating variable depth\n\
    tillage zones [27]. Variable depth tillage (VDT) reduced costs, labor, and fuel\
    \ consumption.\nA multisensor data fusion approach was developed to map soil properties\
    \ for VDT imple-\nmentation, showing the depth of tillage needed in different\
    \ areas. This approach proved\nuseful in guiding VDT operations for efﬁcient soil\
    \ management.\nOne study in Germany integrated computer-aided farming, an IoT-based\
    \ pH sensor,\nand VRT for effective VR liming, and the lime requirement was successfully\
    \ determined\nin situ by establishing a buffer curve [11]. A ﬁeld evaluation of\
    \ a VR aerial application\nwas conducted in the study of Martin and Yang [23]\
    \ utilizing prescription maps for aerial\nglyphosate applications with variable\
    \ rate nozzles. Accurate spray deposition within 20 feet\nAgriculture 2023, 13,\
    \ 1593\n17 of 26\nof the target was conﬁrmed using multispectral imagery, boosting\
    \ conﬁdence in variable\nrate application and encouraging adoption. Italian authors\
    \ Corbari et al. [73] explored the\nintegration of a satellite-driven soil–water\
    \ balance model and meteorological forecasts to\nenable precision smart irrigation.\
    \ It discussed model performance and emphasized the\nimportance of using consistent\
    \ data for the calibration and validation of soil hydrological\nparameters [73].\
    \ The short communication of Jang et al. [22], “Spatial Dependence Analysis\n\
    as a Tool to Detect the Hidden Heterogeneity in a Kenaf Field”, presented high-throughput\n\
    phenotyping as having potential in precision agriculture. This study demonstrated\
    \ its\napplication for revealing ﬁeld heterogeneity and suggested its use for\
    \ better analysis and\nmanagement in plant breeding and precision agriculture.\
    \ In [57], Kim et al. emphasized\nthe importance of evaluating drought effects\
    \ during the vegetative stages of soybean,\nindicating the potential of using\
    \ phenotypic traits as selection indicators for breeding\ndrought-resistant soybean\
    \ cultivars, especially considering the escalating crop damage\ncaused by drought\
    \ and global warming.\nAnother study asserted precision agricultural applications\
    \ in agroforestry. Tree species\nidentiﬁcation and classiﬁcation is important\
    \ when combatting climate change, as well as\nmonitoring ecosystem health 17.\
    \ Researchers used images from SENTINEL-2 to propose\nmethods to determine tree\
    \ type distribution in a wide forest area using UAV images [14,17].\nThey effectively\
    \ distinguished evergreen, deciduous trees, and grassland areas, aiding in\nforest\
    \ planning and preparing for climate change impacts. Ma et al. [14] used a random\n\
    forest classiﬁer with satellite images to improve texture feature separation among\
    \ tree\nspecies. The overall classiﬁcation achieved 86.49% accuracy and a 0.83\
    \ Kappa coefﬁcient,\nalthough altitude, slope, and aspect inﬂuenced tree distribution.\
    \ These outcomes were\nimportant in species classiﬁcation and biodiversity monitoring,\
    \ as well as in informing\ninventory estimation [14].\nAn evaluation of soybean\
    \ wildﬁre prediction via hyperspectral transmission imag-\ning was performed with\
    \ Python, which detected bacterial wildﬁre in soybean leaves\nwhere different\
    \ varieties exhibited distinct spectral signatures. This allowed the precise\n\
    detection and differentiation of healthy and diseased plants effectively with\
    \ high accu-\nracy (97.19% and 95.69%) in early disease detection, conﬁrming its\
    \ usefulness in soybean\nplant monitoring [32].\nAasim et al. [44] focused on\
    \ establishing the efﬁcient and reproducible in vitro re-\ngeneration of common\
    \ beans through a combined approach of in vitro regeneration and\nmachine-learning\
    \ algorithms. ML models, particularly ANN algorithms, were used for\nprediction\
    \ and optimization. The ML and ANN models demonstrated superior perfor-\nmances,\
    \ proving their efﬁcacy in analyzing and optimizing complex conditions in plant\n\
    tissue culture protocols for breeding purposes.\nA computer vision and deep-learning-enabled\
    \ weed detection model for precision\nagriculture was proposed in [25] integrating\
    \ computer vision, DL, the IoT and a smartphone.\nThe proposed CVDL-WDC technique\
    \ combined multiscale object detection and ELM-based\nweed classiﬁcation. The\
    \ results showed improved outcomes over recent approaches, and\nfuture extensions\
    \ included integration with IoT and smartphones.\nAt the same time, a novel procedure\
    \ involving machine learning and UAV-based\nimagery was developed to accurately\
    \ identify crops and weeds, offering potential integra-\ntion into autonomous\
    \ weed management systems and contributing to improved precision\nagriculture\
    \ practices with reduced resource consumption [45].\nAt Sairam Institute of Technology\
    \ in India, a ﬂood detection system based on the\nIoT, big data, and a convolutional\
    \ deep neural network (CDNN) was developed [30].\nThe CDNN algorithm demonstrated\
    \ superior accuracy, achieving an impressive accu-\nracy of 93.23%, a sensitivity\
    \ of 91.43%, a speciﬁcity of 91.56%, a precision of 92.23%,\na recall of 90.36%,\
    \ and an F-score of 91.28% with a data set of 500. The ﬂood detec-\ntion system\
    \ outperformed existing methods and holds potential for further enhancement\n\
    through the integration of IoT devices and advanced algorithms, ensuring improved\
    \ ﬂood\ndetection capabilities.\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n18 of 26\nIn order\
    \ to alleviate the strain on agri-food production, the introduction of alternative\n\
    nutrient sources can be explored, particularly through the utilization of cultured\
    \ meat and\n3D-printed meat as substitutes for traditional animal meats, thus\
    \ reducing the demand on\nanimal husbandry. In China, the production of lab-grown\
    \ meat using muscle stem cells\nnecessitated edible 3D scaffolds created through\
    \ electrohydrodynamic (EHD) printing,\nshowcasing the signiﬁcant potential of\
    \ prolamin scaffolds for cultivating cultured meat [74].\nSimilarly, the construction\
    \ of 3D-printed meat analogs from plant-based proteins has been\nconducted, improving\
    \ the printing performance of soy protein- and gluten-based pastes\nfacilitated\
    \ by rice protein. This study examined the rheological properties and printing\n\
    performances of edible inks made from soy protein isolate (SPI), wheat gluten\
    \ (WG),\nand rice protein (RP). Increasing the proportion of rice protein improved\
    \ the 3D-printing\nperformance, holding potential for the 3D printing of plant-based\
    \ foods and constructing\nmeat analogs simulating real meat properties [75].\n\
    Several studies have shown why the adaption rate of these studies is slow, and\n\
    one case study conducted in Chumphon Province, Thailand, by Kasetsart University\n\
    examined the adoption of smart farming technology among durian farmers, highlighting\n\
    that factors such as age, occupation, access to extension services, and farm size\
    \ inﬂuenced\ntechnology adoption, with younger farmers having larger farms being\
    \ more inclined to\nadopt technology, resulting in decreased labor and fertilizer\
    \ expenses, which emphasized\nthe importance of providing continuous training\
    \ and promoting extension services for\nsustainable adoption [76].\nTable 2. Studies\

    \ Agriculture\nHigh-tech technologies from the fourth industrial revolution have\
    \ the potential to\nrevolutionize the agriculture industry, enabling more efﬁcient\
    \ and sustainable practices\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n20 of 26\nwhile improving\
    \ productivity and reducing resource wastage. The adaptation of these\nintelligent,\
    \ advanced technologies in precision agriculture is still in its early stages,\
    \ and\nas such, there exist several barriers (Table 3) that must be addressed\
    \ to facilitate the\ntransformation of precision agriculture. However, it is essential\
    \ to carefully consider the\nspeciﬁc requirements, challenges, and implementation\
    \ considerations for each technology\nin the context of the agricultural operation\
    \ at hand.\nA lack of interdisciplinary skills is one of the major roadblocks,\
    \ as big data engineers,\ndata analysts, and data scientists do not have an agricultural\
    \ background. On the other\nhand, farmers with long experience and practical knowledge\
    \ are not educated enough to\nhandle high technology like artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ [8]. The production and development\ncosts of high-tech applications and the\
    \ capital for establishing them in real-world agriculture\nare also high [78].\
    \ This high cost of the production and implementation of advanced\ntechnologies\
    \ may render them inaccessible to small-scale farmers, who may lack the\nﬁnancial\
    \ resources to invest in such technologies [79].\nFurthermore, the unavailability\
    \ of affordable technologies for small-scale farmers may\ncreate a digital divide,\
    \ where only large-scale, educated farmers may be able to beneﬁt from\nsuch technologies\
    \ [20,80]. In the unequal distribution of resources in the world, it is difﬁcult\n\
    for certain groups to reach for such new technological inventions. The implementation\n\
    of precision agriculture trends in many developing agricultural countries has\
    \ become a\ndifﬁcult task due to lack of necessary funds, lack of conﬁdence in\
    \ the technologies, lack of\nproper infrastructure, lack of necessary resources,\
    \ etc. [8,76,78,81]. Additionally, the lack of\nsufﬁcient energy in rural areas\
    \ hinders the use of new technologies, even as science strives\nto develop wireless\
    \ power transfer methods and ambient or on-site energy-generating\nmethods [8].\
    \ Furthermore, low digital literacy and unequal accessibility to digital tech-\n\
    nologies in rural areas, coupled with connectivity issues, pose signiﬁcant challenges\
    \ in\nestablishing sustainable intelligent technologies in agricultural processes\
    \ [20,79,82].\nLimited computer power, storage capacity, and processing speed\
    \ and high energy\nconsumption by batteries are some technical obstacles in precision\
    \ agricultural adapta-\ntions [43], especially when dealing with big data. In\
    \ addition, collecting and analyzing\ndata from agricultural operations may raise\
    \ concerns about data privacy and security [4].\nThese data are heterogenous and,\
    \ when transferring and storing vast amounts, software\nplatforms from private\
    \ companies are needed. This reveals some ownership controversies\nof data [78].\
    \ Blockchain interoperability, privacy problems, data leakage, cyber terrorism,\n\
    and some nonrepudiation issues associated with big data are still difﬁculties\
    \ in precision\nagriculture [5,8,78,83], thereby causing farmers to be reluctant\
    \ to share their data with\nthird-party service providers [4,16]. In many areas\
    \ where agriculture is practiced, reli-\nable internet connectivity, which is\
    \ essential for collecting, transmitting, and analyzing\ndata, may not be readily\
    \ available [7] and, thus, may affect the absorption capacities of\nnovel technologies\
    \ [80].\nThe implementation of trending technologies requires technical expertise\
    \ that may\nbe unavailable in some regions, leading to job displacement and unemployment\
    \ as new\ntechnologies increase the demand for highly skilled laborers while decreasing\
    \ opportunities\nfor nonskilled workers. This has implications for both small-scale\
    \ and family commercial\nfarmers [8,9,20,79]. To effectively use these technologies,\
    \ farmers and service providers\nmay need training. However, different technologies\
    \ may not be compatible with each other\nor with existing agricultural machinery\
    \ and equipment, which could limit the adoption\nof advanced technologies in precision\
    \ agriculture [2,8,84]. Furthermore, the presence of\nbias and discrimination\
    \ intertwined with information technology, education, risk-taking\nattitudes,\
    \ and western power structures constitute formidable obstacles, hindering the\n\
    equitable dissemination and advancement of smart-farming technologies, particularly\n\
    within developing nations [80,85]. This highlights the need for policies on data\
    \ sharing that\ncater to both the public and farming industries and are sufﬁcient\
    \ to ensure data security [20].\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n21 of 26\nTable 3.\

    \ aspect is bridging the gap between expertise personnel and farmers. Pro-\nviding\
    \ better education, along with vocational training on novel technological applications,\n\
    can empower farmers to make effective use of new technologies [20,78]. Governments\
    \ can\nplay a signiﬁcant role by creating physical, economic, legal, and social\
    \ infrastructure that\nsupports the establishment of precision agriculture. Investments\
    \ in energy infrastructure\nand communication infrastructure, internet connectivity,\
    \ service markets, consultancy\nservices, and credit markets can instill trust\
    \ and willingness among farmers to embrace\nthese technologies [2,20,81].\nTo\
    \ further enhance precision agriculture, addressing the lack of professional agri-\n\
    cultural sensors is paramount. The design of high-quality, high-resolution, and\
    \ reliable\nsensors powered by the IoT that are speciﬁcally tailored for the agricultural\
    \ production\nenvironment and the monitoring of plant and animal physiological\
    \ signs is essential [8].\nMoreover, integrating wireless power transfer options\
    \ can eliminate the need for frequent\nbattery replacements. However, special\
    \ attention should be given to enabling underground\nor underwater transmission\
    \ capabilities [8]. At the same time, on-site energy generation\nwith renewable\
    \ solar power or biogas energy can be considered comparatively to long\ndistance\
    \ energy transfer [77]. Although capital investment is high for establishment,\
    \ it is\nmore proﬁtable than grid power.\nCross-technology communication is another\
    \ crucial aspect that needs to be addressed.\nMachine vision for animal monitoring,\
    \ the development of smart phone applications for the\nreal-time tracking of spatial\
    \ and temporal variations, and the utilization of 6G mobile net-\nworks are promising\
    \ avenues for generating valuable data and informed decisions [34,83].\nAdditionally,\
    \ the emergence of new agricultural systems such as smart hydroponics with\nthe\
    \ IoT and advancements in breeding technologies with DL and ML technologies con-\n\
    tribute to the overall progress of precision agriculture.\nFuture advancements\
    \ in precision agricultural technologies hold great promise for\nthe agricultural\
    \ sector. Overcoming the existing roadblocks and uncertainties is essential\n\
    to unlocking the full potential of these technologies. By focusing on education,\
    \ infras-\ntructure development, sensor technology, communication systems, and\
    \ novel agricultural\napproaches, we can pave the way for a more efﬁcient, sustainable,\
    \ and productive future\nin agriculture.\n7. Conclusions\nPrecision agriculture,\
    \ now part of Agriculture 4.0, harnesses the power of digitalization\nfor improved\
    \ farming management. The integration of Industry 4.0 technologies has led to\n\
    notable trends, such as drones, GPS technology, data analytics, and artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence,\nenabling informed decision making in farming practices. Despite\
    \ these advancements,\nachieving a fully integrated agricultural management system\
    \ that comprehensively ad-\ndresses the complexities of the ﬁeld requires further\
    \ studies and innovations. Crucially,\nthe development of adaptive and predictive\
    \ information systems that effectively integrate\ndiverse data sources is essential\
    \ for ensuring sustainable and intelligent precision agri-\nculture. While precision\
    \ agriculture offers numerous beneﬁts, it also poses challenges for\nits widespread\
    \ adoption. The initial investment in technology, concerns related to data\nprivacy,\
    \ and compatibility issues with existing farming systems can be signiﬁcant barriers\n\
    for small-scale farmers. Moreover, the scalability and adaptability of these technologies\
    \ to\ndifferent farming conditions may limit their applicability in certain regions.\
    \ Overcoming\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n23 of 26\nthese challenges necessitates\
    \ the implementation of education and training programs to\nequip farmers with\
    \ the necessary skills to leverage these technologies effectively.\nThis review\
    \ paper serves as a valuable resource for farmers and companies seeking\nto adopt\
    \ Industry 4.0 technologies in agriculture. By providing insights into IoT devices,\n\
    automation systems, data analytics, and precision-farming techniques, this paper\
    \ fos-\nters awareness and understanding of the opportunities and challenges in\
    \ smart farming.\nArmed with this knowledge, companies can make informed decisions\
    \ regarding technology\ninvestments and strategic planning while promoting sustainable\
    \ farming practices and\ncollaboration within the industry. By embracing Industry\
    \ 4.0 technologies, farmers and\ncompanies can enhance their agricultural operations,\
    \ optimize resource utilization, and\ncontribute to the collective progress toward\
    \ smart farming’s promising future.\nAuthor Contributions: E.M.B.M.K., A.T.L.,\

    enabled cyber-physical infrastructure. • Sensor web enablement and web processing
    service are mainly utilized. • Two interaction patterns are designed to cooperate
    SOA based geospatial services. • Providing interoperable access for heterogeneous
    sensors, data, and algorithms. • The infrastructure is capable in sensor-based
    precision agriculture monitoring. Abstract Various wireless and wired sensors
    serve vital functions in situational awareness for precision agriculture (PA)
    monitoring. Achieving the seamless integration of these heterogeneous sensors
    into information systems to achieve interoperability is challenging. To solve
    this problem, an integrated open geospatial web service-enabled cyber-physical
    infrastructure was proposed in this study to acquire, integrate, process, and
    distribute monitoring information from the physical sensor space of the PA system
    over the World Wide Web space. This infrastructure was designed as a service-oriented
    architecture middleware between heterogeneous physical sensors and different PA
    information clients. In particular, sensor web enablement and web processing services
    were utilized. Ten types of distributed agricultural sensors were deployed in
    Baoxie field, Wuhan City, and two different experiments were conducted to verify
    the proposed cyber-physical infrastructure. Results demonstrated that this infrastructure
    was capable of handling data and analyses in sensor-based PA monitoring. The proposed
    approach was then compared with existing typical PA infrastructures. Results indicated
    that the proposed cyber-physical infrastructure provided interoperable access
    for heterogeneous sensors, data, and algorithms. The proposed infrastructure thus
    provides a new feasible method for information system design in PA. Previous article

    agricultureSensorsSensor webWeb services 1. Introduction 1.1. Background and problems
    Precision agriculture (PA) has been promoted by multidisciplinary theories and
    technological advancements over the last decade. The core term in PA, called site-specific
    management, is related to natural resource variability, variability management,
    and management zones (Zhang et al., 2002). For a high yield, these field variables
    should be monitored, transmitted, stored, analyzed, mapped, and distributed. Therefore,
    electronic and electrical science (Fernandes et al., 2013), information science
    (Cox, 2002), and computer science (Batte, 2005) have been serving increasingly
    vital functions in agriculture. Heterogeneous sensors, especially wireless sensor
    networks and corresponding web systems, are widely used for precision seeding
    irrigation, fertilization, and harvesting. A development trend in PA is standardization
    (Zhang et al., 2002, Wang et al., 2006) to achieve web sharing and interoperability
    (Murakami et al., 2007). Web sharing provides the prerequisites for wide access
    to agricultural data (Blank et al., 2013). For instance, soil moisture values
    in every management field can be obtained not only by the farmer himself but also
    by a third party in a standard-compliant manner. This feature helps to improve
    the value of agricultural data while reducing repetitive costs. Interoperability
    is recognized as a new paradigm for integrating heterogeneous systems into a synergistic
    unit. These two features are critical for the seamless integration of data, reusability
    of agricultural processes, and loose coupling in the PA web infrastructure (Murakami
    et al., 2007). However, some barriers in achieving web sharing and interoperability
    exist because of different sensor manufacturers, system architectures, and software
    designs of PA systems. The first barrier is heterogeneity in sensor interfaces.
    Sensor interfaces include early analog interfaces (i.e., pulse-width modulation),
    digital interfaces (i.e., RS232, RS485, and serial peripheral interfaces (SPI)),
    and fieldbus interfaces (i.e., controller area networks (CAN), highway addressable
    remote transducers local operating network, and process field bus). However, no
    uniform interface is suitable for all application contexts. Therefore, the interfaces
    used in the field can be diverse. As a result, the integration of agro-sensors
    with different interfaces in the field is cumbersome and requires extensive adaptation
    efforts (Ruiz-Garcia et al., 2009). The second barrier is agricultural data model.
    Several data models have recently been proposed by different organizations. These
    models include AgroXML developed primarily by the Association for Technology and
    Structures in Agriculture in Germany; the ArcGIS model for agriculture discussed
    by the Environmental Systems Research Institute, Inc.; AGROVOC created by the
    Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations and the Commission
    of the European Communities; AgMES; International System for Agricultural Science
    and Technology; and AgXML. Although these models have their own advantages, a
    widely accepted agricultural data model remains unavailable. Understanding the
    syntax and semantics of different models and exchanging data smoothly on the World
    Wide Web (WWW) are hot research topics in PA. The third barrier is related to
    the agriculture web system architecture and software design. An earlier agricultural
    web system may be designed as a closed architecture in a local network. This type
    of infrastructure is incapable of sharing information and cooperating with other
    systems (Kim and Evans, 2009). Given the need for seamless integration and reusability,
    software engineering provides PA with one solution called service-oriented architecture
    (SOA), which integrates distributed web services. Therefore, an increasing number
    of SOA-based PA systems have been proposed because of their openness and flexibility
    (Nikkila et al., 2010, Murakami et al., 2007). However, more studies and experiments
    should be conducted in PA to explore new potential advantages by utilizing multi-disciplinary
    web services, such as geospatial web services. In addition to these three barriers,
    different data transmission protocols and security concerns are involved in the
    design of a shareable and interoperable web information system for PA. Therefore,
    researchers worldwide have conducted numerous studies to solve these heterogeneities
    in PA (Iftikhar and Pedersen, 2011, Schuster et al., 2011). However, a satisfactory
    solution for acquiring, integrating, processing, and distributing PA monitoring
    information interoperably over the WWW space from the physical sensor space remains
    unavailable. The Open Geospatial Consortium, Inc. (OGC) and ISO/TC211 Geographic
    Information/Geomatics have proposed a series of geospatial and location-related
    standards for a number of fields in the last decade including PA. Different geo-information
    in PA can be handled using these OGC standards. This mechanism is another approach
    to achieve interoperability in PA sensor systems. Web Map Service (WMS), Web Feature
    Service (WFS), Web Coverage Service (WCS), and Geography Markup Language (GML)
    have already shown their advantages in distributing geo-information (Han et al.,
    2012). The OGC published Web Processing Service (WPS) in 2007 to define standardized
    interfaces that facilitate the publishing, discovery, and binding of geospatial
    processes by clients (Schut, 2007). WPS is compatible with both Web Service Definition
    Language and Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), thus facilitating interoperability
    with generic, non-geospatial web services. Although Yang et al. (2012) discussed
    the potential of WPS in agricultural processing, research in this area is still
    in its infancy. A promising open geospatial web service used in PA is Sensor Web
    Enablement (SWE). The NASA Sensor Web Applied Research Planning Group first proposed
    the term “Sensor Web” in the late 1990s. It is a macro-instrument concept comprising
    spatially distributed sensor platforms that share information among themselves
    and act in concert as a single instrument (Delin, 2002). The SWE initiative in
    the OGC standardized web service interfaces, data, and sensor models in sensor
    systems. After several revisions by the OGC, the SWE can support almost all aspects
    of heterogeneous sensor applications. Such applications include Sensor Model Language
    (SensorML) for sensor modeling and discovery; Sensor Observation Service (SOS)
    for retrieving sensor data and metadata; Observation and Measurement (O&M) for
    modeling different data; Sensor Planning Service for sensor tasking; and Web Notification
    Service for asynchronous notifications. Therefore, the SWE initiative has potential
    for providing an information middleware to integrate web-ready sensors (Nash et
    al., 2009). Kubicek et al. (2013) utilized O&M for agriculture, and visualized
    the O&M data adaptively. Given the interoperable and real-time characteristics
    of a sensor web, sensor web-integrated infrastructure provides some new features
    for PA, which is the focus of this study. 1.2. Purposes and outline As different
    sensors are utilized to detect spatial-temporal variations in fields, this study
    attempts to design an open geospatial web service-integrated cyber-physical infrastructure
    for sensor-based PA monitoring. The proposed cyber-physical infrastructure can
    serve as an open standards integrated middleware between heterogeneous monitoring
    sensors and different PA applications. More importantly, this cyber-physical infrastructure
    can provide seamless interaction for real-time data sharing, loose coupling for
    reuse, and interoperability for cooperation. Therefore, this research includes
    three objectives (1) exploring merits of integrating open geospatial services,
    especially SWE in cyber-physical infrastructure for PA, (2) designing a novel
    architecture and orchestrated interaction patterns to coordinate these open geospatial
    web services, and (3) validating and evaluating the proposed cyber-physical infrastructure.
    This article is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the design goals, architecture
    overview, and two interaction patterns for this cyber-physical infrastructure.
    Two field experiments that validate this infrastructure are then presented in
    Section 3. Section 4 presents a discussion of our approach, comparison with four
    existing approaches, and a summary of the merits and limitations. Finally, Section
    5 presents the conclusions and future work. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Design
    goals Cyber-physical infrastructure is a coordinated environment, which includes
    several hardware components, software, and interactions. In PA, a cyber-physical
    infrastructure is similar to a bridge that connects heterogeneous agricultural
    sensors with different PA clients. The cyber-physical infrastructure is also similar
    to a black box, in which all differences between physical sensor interfaces, data
    transmissions, data formats, and control modes are hidden from the users. The
    higher-level applications only need to concentrate on a suite of standard interfaces.
    Therefore, acquiring, integrating, processing, and distributing monitoring information
    in PA are the aims of the proposed cyber-physical infrastructure. Before designing
    the architecture of this infrastructure, some design goals are given below. (1)
    Integrating heterogeneous agricultural sensors As discussed above, the sensors
    installed in a field can be coordinated through different interfaces, such as
    SPI and CAN. These sensors can also be accessed by different transmission protocols
    such as IEEE 802.11 or Bluetooth. Therefore, the proposed cyber-physical infrastructure
    should be capable of hiding these physical differences and managing them transparently
    over the WWW. In this manner, a higher-level application (i.e., a precision irrigation
    support desktop system, or an iOS-based fertilization monitoring system) can obtain
    sensor data without knowing their physical details. Applications can operate heterogeneous
    sensors in a simple standard-based manner from the web, thus decreasing the need
    for adaptation. (2) Web-based instant sharing of real-time data and processes
    Real-time or near real-time monitoring enables farmers to be aware of some anomalous
    events or potential emergencies immediately. Agricultural data, such as soil moisture,
    air temperature, and precipitation, are also valuable for environmental modeling
    and hydrology analysis. Therefore, the proposed cyber-physical infrastructure
    should not only gather and publish real-time data but also share data on the web
    for wider availability. Furthermore, processing algorithms should be shared on
    the web as well. This feature is necessary to lower the cost of the repetitive
    construction of PA sensors and agro-processes. This feature can also simultaneously
    lower the process learning curve and enhance reusability. (3) Open and flexible
    The components of a cyber-physical infrastructure should be organized in a loosely
    coupled manner and be independent of any specific hardware platform, operating
    system, and implementation language. In particular, any component inside the infrastructure
    can easily be added, removed, and updated without affecting other components.
    Therefore, a distributed structure is required. This cyber-physical infrastructure
    should also be open and sufficiently neutral for diverse high-level applications.
    2.2. Infrastructure architecture SOA-based cyber-physical infrastructure architecture
    was designed on the basis of open geospatial web services to achieve the three
    goals discussed above (Fig. 1). Download : Download high-res image (317KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 1. Architecture of an open geospatial web service-integrated
    cyber-physical infrastructure. Fig. 1 shows that this PA architecture comprises
    four layers. Besides the physical and application layers, two layers in the cyber-physical
    infrastructure exist, namely, the sensing and business layers. These four layers
    are divided on the basis of their functions in the PA monitoring system. The physical
    layer is a set of agricultural sensors and transmission devices deployed in soil
    or between crops. These sensors transfer measurements of environmental conditions
    (e.g., air humidity and soil moisture) through electronic signals. The data are
    then pulled out regularly by the upper gateway service. Therefore, the physical
    layer is the basic layer to support other PA operations. Regardless of diverse
    operation interfaces, communication protocols, and sensors, this physical layer
    is the data input layer for the proposed cyber-physical infrastructure. The application
    layer is the interface between users and PA systems. The cyber-physical infrastructure
    provides general functions for sensors and data, whereas the application layer
    focuses on a specific application. Therefore, the application, such as a precision
    irrigation system or yield mapping system, is referred to as the client for this
    study. Third party PA information providers can customize the multiplatform- and
    multi-granularity-specific clients by using the open standard interfaces defined
    by this cyber-physical infrastructure. 2.2.1. Sensing layer The sensing layer
    is primarily based on the SOS introduced by the SWE framework, which provides
    a popular interoperability interface to store and distribute sensor data from
    heterogeneous sensors. The potential value of SOS for the interoperability in
    PA was explored in this study. Moreover, SOS also supports spatial queries, temporal
    queries, property queries, and combination queries, thus benefiting different
    user-defined data requests. Before standardizing data through SOS, a gateway service
    was deployed to transform sensor data to SWE-enabled information. First, the IP
    address and port of the gateway service were configured in a field-data hub. A
    TCP/IP connection was then established once the gateway service detected the connection
    request from the field-data hub. The gateway service could then send a sensor
    data request to the field-data hub according to different data communication protocols.
    After receiving a data response from the field-data hub, the gateway service parsed
    it from binary format to plaintext. Finally, the gateway service encoded raw sensor
    data into O&M-compliant XML format. Therefore, the O&M is used as the final standard
    data format in the sensing layer. O&M is an international standard (ISO 19156)
    that defines a conceptual schema for different observations to enhance data semantics
    and accessibility. Although O&M was proposed in the context of geography, the
    model is not limited to it. Collected agricultural data, as well as meta-data
    in PA can also be modeled by O&M, which are stored in SOS. SOAP and HTTP transmission
    protocols are supported. 2.2.2. Business layer This layer is a relatively high
    layer in this cyber-physical infrastructure. Advanced agricultural analyses can
    be realized in this layer. WPS is adopted as an open processing interface by wrapping
    different processing algorithms and models for PA, such as a buffer algorithm,
    a crop production prediction model, or a crop water requirement model. WMS can
    also publish web maps, such as farm base maps or nitrogen distribution maps, as
    an output from the WPS. WFS can also return geospatial features, such as points
    (i.e., deployment points of wireless sensors), polylines, and polygons (i.e.,
    observation range of a weather station). WCS can also provide a standard interface
    to retrieve coverage data, such as remote sensing imagery and the digital elevation
    model of the farmland. In this layer, the GML is used to encode geographical features
    in data exchanging between services, and both SOAP and HTTP protocols are supported.
    2.3. Interaction patterns Clients/applications need to interact with this two-layer
    integrated cyber-physical infrastructure to fulfill different PA monitoring requirements.
    After sufficient experiments and abstractions, two typical interaction patterns
    were found: (1) a primary monitoring pattern and (2) an advanced monitoring pattern.
    The sequence diagram from the Unified Modeling Language (UML) is used to show
    the interactions between processes in a sequential order. It shows different participating
    processes or objects (parallel vertical lines (lifelines)) and messages exchanged
    between them (horizontal arrows). These sequence diagrams help us to understand
    the interfaces and functions of different services in this infrastructure. 2.3.1.
    Primary monitoring pattern The primary monitoring pattern is used when different
    FMIS clients need to obtain real-time and historical observation data from deployed
    agricultural sensors. Therefore, the application, sensing, and physical layers
    are all involved in this scenario. Before being standardized by the SOS, the gateway
    service acts as a broker by transferring messages from the web to the cyber-physical
    infrastructure. In particular, the gateway service first pulls data from the physical
    sensors by interacting with the field-data hub, and then the field-data hub pushes
    the data back. After gathering data from the web, this gateway posts them to the
    SOS using the InsertObservation interface. The SOS can then publish data in an
    open manner using the GetObservation interface. Therefore, clients on the web
    can access the agricultural data measured in this farmland using this SOS as long
    as other constraints were satisfied. WMS/WMTS and WFS can also provide farmland
    base maps and features. The sequence diagram of the primary monitoring pattern
    is shown in Fig. 2. Notably, the function of SOS is to provide a high-level, aggregated,
    and open interface for sensor users. In a diverse sensor environment, the primary
    monitoring pattern facilitates the querying and acquiring spatial–temporal referenced
    data without the need to communicate with one sensor or one sensor network individually.

    Fig. 2. Sequence diagram of the primary monitoring pattern. 2.3.2. Advanced monitoring
    pattern This advanced monitoring pattern mainly takes advantage of the WPS for
    open processing for PA. First, the WPS provided the GetCapabilities interface
    for clients to query useable and suitable processes within. The client then obtained
    mandatory and optional parameters required by the process through the DescribeProcess
    interface. The Execute operation was then called to execute this process. In this
    stage, SOS, WMS, WFS, and WCS can be employed to obtain essential data to run
    the process using the primary monitoring pattern or publish processing results
    through their interfaces. Finally, the data or data URL was returned to the clients.
    The results were then accessed by the primary monitoring pattern. The sequence
    diagram of the advanced monitoring pattern is shown in Fig. 3. The use of a distributed
    web processing service allows flexibility when updating and redeploying algorithms.
    All algorithm changes are invisible to the users because the interfaces are unchanged.
    Therefore, the clients do not need any modifications when the algorithms are updated.
    Considering the web-based processing functions, the FMIS or other clients can
    run on a low-cost machine such as a mobile device. Download : Download high-res

    conducted to serve as a proof-of-concept. The results were then analyzed to validate
    the merits of the proposed open geospatial service-integrated cyber-physical infrastructure.
    3.1. Experimental site A 20 m × 40 m test field located at 30°28′13.00″N and 114°31′35.71″E
    was selected to test the proposed cyber-physical infrastructure. Fig. 4 shows
    that 15 soil moisture sensors and 3 soil temperature sensors were deployed 10
    cm below the surface to measure soil conditions. Two heterogeneous meteorological
    stations were installed above ground. Eight types of sensors were employed to
    monitor the following agricultural conditions continuously: wind speed, wind direction,
    air humidity, air pressure, air temperature, precipitation, net radiation, and

    of agricultural sensors deployed. These sensors are heterogeneous because they
    were constructed by different manufacturers. Sensors with the RS485 interface
    produced by Wuhan Xinlvyuan Technology Development Co., Ltd. were installed at
    the meteorological station 1 and at the soil station. Wireless sensors with the
    IEEE 1451 interface that were assembled by ourselves were installed at the meteorological
    station 2. The Modbus protocol was also used in data transmission for the RS485
    sensors, whereas the smart transducer interface module was used for the IEEE 1451
    sensors. Thus, the transformation from different protocol-based sensor data to
    SWE-enabled information is required. Therefore, the following two experiments
    demonstrate how to integrate these physical sensors using the proposed infrastructure
    to achieve sharing and interoperability in the web information space. 3.2. Experiment
    1: real-time visualization of agro-meteorological measurements The physical layer
    (in Fig. 1) was based on the experimental site described above. The gateway service
    was then installed by implementing a Windows service on one server. This service
    sent a data request to the field-data hub using different protocols (i.e., RS-485
    or IEEE 1451). The field-data hub then sent the requested data back through a
    telecommunication network and the WWW. After receiving these raw data, the O&M
    encapsulation function in the gateway service started to encode “local” data as
    web sharing data. These heterogeneous agro-meteorological measurements were then
    stored through the InsertObservation interface of the SOS service. One implementation
    of SOS (i.e., 52°North SOS) was adopted. The 52°North SOS utilizes the PostgreSQL
    database management system with PostGIS extension to store sensor data. Fig. 5
    shows a sample InsertObservation request with two main parts, namely, the assigned
    SensorId and O&M encapsulated data. This sample request implies that at 17:59:01
    + 08:00 on 2014-01-11, one sensor (ID: urn:liesmars:insitusensor:BaoxieSoilMoistureStation-LVDSC12-25)
    measured soil humidity at 30.46992°N and 114.52636°E with a value of 31.1%. Using
    this O&M schema, all different types of observation data such as wind speed data
    can be represented and exchanged in the same way. Fig. 6 shows the InsertObservation
    response returned from the SOS. If this data insert request is valid, SOS will
    return an ID (o_53865298) to represent this successful insert operation. If no
    ID was returned, it indicates that this data insert operation failed. Download

    by using a model in compliance with the SensorML standard. Fig. 7 shows the SensorML-based
    information model of a soil moisture sensor (ID: urn:liesmars:insitusensor:BaoxieSoilMoistureStation-LVDSC12-25)

    and other metadata (i.e., classification, valid time, characteristics, and position).
    This meta-information of heterogeneous sensors can be obtained using the DescribeSensor
    interface of SOS. Therefore, clients on the web can access this sensor and its
    data through its SOS interface and by using these important meta-information.

    response example to retrieve historical data from one sensor. Subsequently, a
    test client was implemented to retrieve and visualize different real-time and
    historical agro-meteorological measurements in this field using the primary monitoring
    pattern. Fig. 10 shows that this client continuously retrieves real-time sensor
    data from the SOS and displays the data on the left. These observations are refreshed
    at a certain frequency, i.e., every 10 s. On the right, the Tianditu (Map World),
    which is the public version of the national platform for common geospatial information
    service of China, was used. Tianditu provides JavaScript-based web APIs to construct
    a geospatial client quickly. In our experiment, Tianditu web APIs were mainly
    utilized to provide a base map service, add overlays, and response to user inputs
    (e.g., click). For example, a “TMarker” (i.e., “var sensor_location = new TMarker
    (new TLngLat (114.526587, 30.470278))”) to add the location of a sensor. This
    location label was then added to the base map and called “map.addOverLay (sensor
    location).” By clicking on the label of the sensor on the map, a “MarkerClick”
    map event defined in Tianditu APIs was captured. The DescribeSensor interface
    of the SOS was then triggered to retrieve the sensor metadata for users. Therefore,
    farmers can obtain the sensor’s information intuitively, including the name, intended
    applications, state, keywords, organization, and picture, which were already modeled
    in the SensorML (Fig. 7). Besides the real-time data, historical data can also
    be simultaneously plotted below in this client. Download : Download high-res image

    visualization of agro-meteorological measurements based on the proposed cyber-physical
    infrastructure and primary interaction pattern. Notably, an air temperature sensor,
    called LVQSZ33 was present in the client. Real-time air temperature was measured
    at 7.7 °C at 23:01:17 on January 19, 2014. During the previous 24 h (January 18),
    the highest temperature was approximately 13 °C at 15:00, whereas the lowest temperature
    was approximately 2 °C at 7:00 on January 19. Similarly, all 10 types of agricultural
    measurements in this field can be accessed and displayed in this manner. These
    historical and real-time data, as well as meta-information of the sensors, were
    all obtained through the SOS using the primary monitoring pattern. 3.3. Experiment
    2: soil moisture collaborative mapping Farmers should be aware of soil moisture
    conditions over the entire area of their fields. However, since sensors are limited
    and must be dispersed to the field, obtaining a complete soil moisture map based
    on limited sensors is challenging. Geographical methods can be employed to handle
    this problem efficiently. The first law of geography states that, “Everything
    is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things”
    (Tobler, 1970). Several multivariate interpolation algorithms, such as inverse
    distance weighting (IDW), kriging, and spline interpolation, were put forward
    on the basis of this law. These geospatial algorithms are widely used to calculate
    assigned values at unknown points. These WPS-wrapped interpolation algorithms
    can be constructed for our proposed cyber-physical infrastructure. For this experiment,
    five WPSs were implemented to create a real-time soil moisture map collaboratively.
    Fig. 11 shows that the FMIS client interacts with the Mapping, Points to Shapefile,
    Interpolation, Rendering, and Publish to WMS WPSs. These WPSs utilized the distributed
    organizational structure to form scalable and loosely coupled WPS services. Download

    Implementation of soil moisture mapping using seven open geospatial web services.
    Scattered soil points and their soil moisture values were directly retrieved using
    the primary monitoring pattern. The Points to Shapefile WPS then enabled us to
    create a point Shapefile, which was the input of the Interpolation WPS. The identifier
    of this WPS was called “v.surf.idw.” Fig. 12 shows the DescribeProcess response
    of the core Interpolation WPS based on IDW. This response indicates that the input
    of this WPS was the Shapefiles or zipped Shapefile and the output was a tiff image.
    The output is the final soil condition map for the entire field. All functional
    WPSs in this experiment, including the IDW algorithm based interpolation WPS,
    were constructed using ArcGIS Engine 10.0 components. For example, the IInterpolationOp
    interface provided by the ArcGIS Engine helps to build reliable interpolation
    functions. Download : Download high-res image (291KB) Download : Download full-size

    The output format is specified as a tiff image. The interpolated tiff image was
    then rendered and published as a WMS for web access. The “wmsLayer” in Tianditu
    JS APIs can be utilized to construct the final WMS layer object: “var wmsLayer
    = new TTilelayerWMS(“layers”, url, config)”. The “map.addLayer” method can then
    be called to add this resulting WMS layer to the Tianditu base map: “map.addLayer(wmsLayer).”
    By adding a timer, this collaborative mapping scheme can run automatically and
    obtain a near real-time result (e.g., one soil condition map every half hour).
    Fig. 14 shows that a test client was implemented to verify the final mapping result.
    The left part of this client is used to display the sensor distribution. The right
    part of this client is used to query, select, and play maps with animation effects.
    By selecting a start time (2014-02-11 15:08:18), end time (2014-02-12 15:08:16),
    and soil profile depth (10 cm), users can obtain all soil moisture maps during
    this period. The user can also select each single soil moisture map to understand
    soil conditions in the field. The user can also display all of the maps to view
    dynamic variations in soil conditions. The variations in soil moisture values
    of each sensor can also be plotted on the lower right. Download : Download high-res

    the soil moisture collaborative mapping results based on the proposed cyber-physical
    infrastructure and advanced interaction pattern. The said map shows that the soil
    moisture distribution in this test field was unbalanced, with the lowest value
    (8.8%) in the northeast and the highest value (61.5%) in the southwest. The rest
    of this field maintained relatively normal soil moisture (30–40%). Therefore,
    the farmer should only irrigate the northeast part of the land to normalize the
    whole soil moisture distribution. After obtaining the field soil moisture map
    from the proposed infrastructure, software algorithms can be used to detect anomalous
    local regions in this field in terms of soil moisture. Crop, meteorology, and
    soil composition are required to judge the anomalous soil moisture conditions.
    If an anomalous region (e.g., drought area) is detected successfully, only a nearby
    irrigation facility should be triggered to balance the water condition in the
    soil automatically. Therefore, this automated event-driven method can respond
    to an emergency in the field more quickly and appropriately. The lower right line
    chart displays soil moisture values of the LVDSC12-08 sensor over a long period.
    The condition of the soil measured by this sensor was relatively steady (approximately
    40%) with few deviations. This sensor is also located in the lower middle part
    of the test field, which can be found on the upper left part of the sensor distribution
    map. 4. Discussion 4.1. Comparisons Four typical existing methods for designing
    PA monitoring infrastructure were compared in terms of eight features shown below
    in Table 1. These features include architecture, supported sensors, data sharing,
    process sharing, services involved, data model, validation, and complexity. As
    each infrastructure has its own unique features and contributions, this comparison
    tries to figure out the advantages of the proposed method in multi-sensor based
    PA monitoring scenarios. The detailed comparisons were discussed below. Table

    (2004) designed an interoperable geo-data infrastructure for PA. These researchers
    realized the increasing importance of geo-information in PA. Therefore, spatial
    data infrastructures (SDI) should be established to handle geo-related data in
    PA, which is consistent with our viewpoint. In the soil sampling use case, Korduan
    et al. identified five actors and employed two OGC services (i.e., WMS and WFS),
    the Internet, a GML, and a database to build an SDI for providing geo-information
    from the field. This WMS and WFS-integrated infrastructure for PA was an innovation
    in 2004. While, the cyber-physical infrastructure proposed in this study not only
    utilizes WMS and WFS but also sensor web/SWE and WPS. The sensor web is a popular
    methodology for sensor-based research and applications (Conover et al., 2010,
    Havlik et al., 2011, Kanbayashi and Sato, 2011). By integrating the sensor web
    standards and sensors in PA, real-time metrological and soil data can be accumulated
    from physical sensors and then distributed over the web through consensus-based
    interfaces. The first experiment showed that real-time and historical monitoring
    data could be retrieved from heterogeneous sensors through a standard interface.
    Besides, the second experiment indicated that WPS could be a valuable tool for
    web-based analysis in PA. A new functionality only has to be integrated into the
    proposed infrastructure once. According to different complexities of new functions,
    different numbers of new WPSs should be implemented. For example, if the function
    of average monthly precipitation is required, only an averaging algorithm based
    WPS should be implemented. Some new averaging functions, such as the average annual
    temperature, can use this WPS without repetitive algorithm implementations. For
    a complex functionality, (e.g., crop yield prediction), several existing WPSs
    can also be re-utilized (e.g., rendering WPS). Only the core algorithm relative
    to crop yield prediction need to be implemented. These functional WPSs can also
    be used by the other PA clients. Murakami et al. (2007) designed an infrastructure
    for the development of distributed service-oriented information systems for PA
    in 2007. These researchers presented an SOA-based infrastructure and a standard
    language, called PAML, for data exchange. By integrating software engineering
    techniques and concepts (i.e., XML, SOA, and service bus) with some agricultural
    services and open geospatial services (i.e., WMS and WFS), this infrastructure
    served as a foundation for different high-level applications. This study encouraged
    researchers to absorb and utilize software engineering tools for PA. Thus, the
    infrastructure presented in this study also included some software engineering
    concepts, such as the design of the two-layered SOA-based infrastructure and the
    UML interaction patterns. The infrastructure proposed in this study was designed
    using physical sensors as data input, which served as the foundation for up-to-date
    PA data. The web interoperability of sensors was achieved, with the help of SWE
    and WPS. Therefore, the above two experiments showed the advantages of the proposed
    method in data and information retrieval. However, the design of the service bus
    in Murakami’s infrastructure was not included in this work. The service bus is
    important for invoking the services which are physically distributed across the
    network. Therefore, the proposed infrastructure can be improved in the future
    by utilizing services catalog services from the OGC. Nash et al. (2009) systematically
    reviewed the use of open geospatial web services in PA for the first time. Three
    typical use cases designs were proposed to demonstrate the great potential of
    open geospatial web services in PA. Nevertheless, cases were high-level designs
    without experimental validation. The proposed method was tested and verified by
    two typical field experiments. Based on the real agricultural sensors in the field,
    the proposed infrastructure and patterns were validated in handling geospatially
    referenced PA data. What’s more, complete infrastructure and architecture, as
    well as two interaction models from practices were also presented. These designs
    and detailed interaction models should be helpful for PA researchers. Notably,
    although some ideas of our approach were derived from Nash’s work, our research
    moved a step further, as discussed above. Nikkila et al. (2010) analyzed additional
    requirements for FMIS in PA. They also identified the requirements imposed by
    PA on FMIS. A web-based approach for the implementation of an FMIS was evaluated,
    which fulfilled these additional requirements. The six requirements in implementing
    an FMIS for PA include the support of digital data transfer; the storage and management
    of GIS data, large quantities of data, meta-information, and device-specific information;
    as well as the creation of operational plans. Although our infrastructure was
    designed as a foundation for different FMISs, instead of a simple FMIS, our design
    can also meet most of these requirements. As tested in prior experiments, the
    meta-information of the GIS data was supported by the O&M encoding method used
    in our approach. Experiment 1 and Fig. 5 showed that the metadata of sampling
    time (timestamp), procedure (related sensors), observed property (what is measured),
    and feature of interest (location) were encoded. The SensorML encoding method
    used in our approach also supports the meta-information of devices. Fig. 7 showed
    that the metadata of heterogeneous sensors included text description, name, keywords,
    identifiers, classification, valid time, characteristics, capabilities, contact,
    location, and interfaces. Such a wealth of meta-information can be useful for
    precise sensor discovery and operations. The PostgreGIS database, with the GIS
    extension based on the PostgreSQL database, was adopted by the SOS service in
    our infrastructure. Therefore, the SOS can meet the demand of storage and management
    of significant amounts of GIS data. However, the proposed infrastructure cannot
    support the complete PA information system because of the research aim of this
    work. Nikkila et al. designed a web-based FMIS architecture that can handle all
    PA tasks. Therefore, a complete PA information system solution can be achieved
    by combining Nikkila’s design with ours. 4.2. Merits and limitations The experiments
    and comparisons revealed that the proposed cyber-physical infrastructure had some
    unique features and advantages over existing studies. These advantages and limitations
    were summarized below. (1) Feasible solution for sensor-based PA monitoring The
    proposed cyber-physical infrastructure is capable of integrating different sensors
    used in farmland from raw data to thematic maps. The benefit of using the sensor
    web concept and SWE framework is that these tools provide a standard access manner
    for heterogeneous agricultural sensors. Experiments showed that the data flowed
    seamlessly from the physical domain to the information space. Therefore, this
    infrastructure was referred to as a cyber-physical infrastructure, rather than
    just a cyber-infrastructure. In this cyber-physical infrastructure, data and processes
    are exposed by web services in an interoperable manner. The SensorML promotes
    the interoperability of sensors, and the O&M/SOS helps to achieve web sharing
    of the observation data. The WPS can also decrease repetitive work and enhance
    the capability of running complex algorithms. (2) Good emphasis on geospatial
    models and methods Geographical models and methods are important for PA, especially
    for the expression and analysis of spatial-temporal variations in the field. Our
    approach highlighted this importance by adopting the advanced methods from the
    OGC. By integrating these open geospatial services, this infrastructure is a valuable
    tool in the spatiotemporal data acquisition, display, and analysis for FMIS in
    PA. (3) SOA architecture for maintenance and update Unlike desktop applications
    for PA, the SOA-based philosophy was utilized in the design of the architecture.
    By installing web services in a distributed environment, the failure risk and
    the update cost were reduced. Therefore, this approach is more flexible than stand-alone
    applications. Although the proposed cyber-physical infrastructure has these three
    merits, some limitations still exist. First, the whole infrastructure is a slightly
    more complex compared with previous approaches. Promoting the balance in the functionality
    and usability of this infrastructure still requires future work. The second limitation
    is the completeness. Given the focus of sensor-based PA monitoring in this work,
    rather than the complete operations, the proposed approach was designed to handle
    agricultural sensors, instead of traditional PA information. Therefore, if a complete
    PA solution is desired, the proposed method must combine with other traditional
    PA information systems to provide the managements of general PA data and documents.
    Another limitation is the multi-service registration, query, and management for
    the proposed infrastructure. If a catalog service can be added to the business
    layer, the integration of services will be more efficient. 5. Conclusion and outlook
    Wired/wireless sensors serve vital functions in situational awareness in farming.
    Given different sensor interfaces, system architectures, and software designs,
    the seamless integration and reuse of these heterogeneous sensors are challenges
    in PA. The consensus-based OGC SWE standards enable the retrieval and aggregation
    of observed data, even from multiple sensor networks without requiring knowledge
    of the diverse protocols and data formats used by individual sensors. With the
    use of the sensor web concept and SWE standards, a middleware was designed to
    act between the heterogeneous sensors of the physical domain and different PA
    applications on the web. This middleware consists of two layers and six open geospatial
    web services. After conducting two field experiments, this cyber-physical infrastructure
    was found capable of acquiring data from the physical sensor space, as well as
    of processing, integrating, and distributing such data seamlessly on the WWW.
    The interoperability of the sensors, data, as well as processes and the flexibility
    in the architecture, were achieved to provide a referable method for PA information
    design. Although this infrastructure is efficient, a fully functional design for
    all PA operations still requires further research. The limitations in complexity
    and management of multi-web services can be overcome by future work. With more
    research, a one-stop infrastructure solution with high efficiency can be available
    in the future to support all types of PA data, processes, and controls. Acknowledgments

    Publisher: IEEE Introduction Nowadays, the Internet of Things (IoT) has already
    left the state of an idea and has been applied in practical projects. The technical
    and application challenges are enormous since IoT platforms enable complex real-time
    control systems that combine the use of communication infrastructure, hardware,
    software, analytical techniques, and application knowledge combined into multiple
    layers. One of the key technical challenges is to realize the expected IoT impacts
    on systems, as IoT allows them to become service mashups, connecting things as
    services. Consequently, system development will become dynamic plug-and-play interoperable
    service composition, and system logic will become service orchestration. Overall,
    IoT allows solution flexibility to fulfill custom application needs. In the context
    of agriculture, irrigation is a key task to guarantee adequate crop yield by avoiding
    under- and over-watering. Moreover, it is an important cost driver, as the energy
    to transport water and to operate irrigation equipment is costly – in some places,
    even the water itself is costly. Smart irrigation seeks to apply IoT and analytical
    methods to leverage precision irrigation, aiming optimal cost effectiveness to
    the farmer by flowing the water in the proper amount to places where and when
    it is needed. In this article we introduce the concept of a flexible IoT-machine
    learning (ML) platform, wherein IoT and ML components are connected as services
    in an application context, allowing adaptable solutions to fulfill application
    needs. This approach benefits IoT professionals, as they can easily develop and
    deploy complex solutions involving devices, communication, data management, analytics,
    and application elements. In particular, our work on this concept has resulted
    in a platform called SWAMP1 that implements our flexible IoT-ML architecture toward
    the smart irrigation problem. This allows highly customizable soil water management
    solutions, involving flexible connectivity among data, physical models, and ML
    algorithms oriented to solve application key tasks, such as water need estimation
    and irrigation planning and operation. We call this concept flexible data-driven
    soil water management, which in practice allows suitable solutions to a great
    variety of soil, plant, and regional weather characteristics. This approach benefits
    the farmer, as a highly customizable smart irrigation solution may reduce water
    and energy usage and mitigate crop yield risks as it keeps soil water content
    at healthy levels for plants. In the remainder of this article, we compare our
    approach to other practical IoT research projects, provide details on our flexible
    platform applied to precision irrigation, describe our flexible ML approach to
    address precision irrigation tasks, highlight the potential impacts of our approach
    to IoT professionals and farmers, and summarize our main contributions. Related
    Work In recent years, different academic and commercial initiatives have emerged,
    aiming to incorporate IoT and ML into the agriculture. IoF2020 (www.iof2020.eu)2
    and Dragon (www.data-dragon.eu) are two projects funded by the European Union
    for developing IoT platforms for agrifood. IoF2020 is organized into five sectors
    that adopt different solutions: arable crops, dairy, vegetables, fruits, and meat.
    Arable crops use sensors to monitor production and intelligent analysis of images
    to assess crop development. GPS data from cattle neck collars or livestock movements
    monitor dairy chain, and ML is used for early lameness detection. IoT devices
    track the production chain of vegetables, fruits, and meat. Dragon aims to integrate
    IoT data with phenomics, genomics, and metagenomics data associated with ML methods
    to increase production. Other recent academic studies include a platform for precision
    agriculture and experimentation in turmeric cultivation [1]. The platform provides
    a graphical interface for connecting sensors and actuators and uses analytical
    methods to analyze the delay of messages. Another study uses thermal images generated
    by drones and transmitted throughout a cloud-fog system to identify non-uniform
    irrigation zones [2]. Commercial companies are also putting some of these ideas
    into the market. Examples include Agrosmart (www.agrosmart.com.br) in Brazil,
    Agricolus (www.agricolus.com) in Italy, and Cropmetrics (www.cropmetrics.com)
    in the United States. Among other technologies, they use soil sensors, weather
    stations, and weather forecasts for irrigation advising. However, their underlying
    approaches for water need estimation and irrigation optimization and operation
    are not available. Despite the richness of recent approaches adopting IoT in the
    agri-food chain, they do not yet fully explore: (a) the architectural aspects
    to hold flexible solutions involving IoT and ML components and (b) the potential
    of the collected data for a more accurate analysis of water needs. In this article,
    we advocate that data-intensive methods provided by ML algorithms, in combination
    with IoT technologies and weather-soil-atmosphere simulations, can provide a considerable
    impact in precision irrigation and its solution deployment. A Flexible IoT-ML
    Platform for Smart Irrigation The success of next generation systems for precision
    irrigation based on IoT technologies coupled with intelligent ML data processing
    techniques depends on the ability of the solution to adapt to different contexts
    found in farms. A flexible IoT-ML platform must allow different deployment configurations
    of hardware, software, and communication technologies, customized to deal with
    the requirements and constraints of different settings, countries, climate, soils,
    and crops. Here we advocate that an IoT-ML infrastructure for providing smart
    irrigation services be defined by two complementary dimensions, namely core components
    and deployment locations. Core components are a set of software, hardware, and
    communication technologies, such as soil moisture sensor probes, long-range WAN
    (LoRaWAN) [3], Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) [4], LoRa Server (www.loraserver.io),
    FIWARE [5], and SEPA [6], as well as specific services for water need estimation
    and irrigation planning and operation. On the other hand, deployment locations
    define where core components can be placed, and how they communicate with each
    other. This generates distinctive configuration scenarios for different deployments.
    Locations follow an IoT computing continuum, composed of things (sensors and actuators),
    mist (field nodes such as radio gateways), fog (farm on-premise computing infrastructure),
    cloud (data storage and processing), and terminal (a smartphone, tablet, or laptop
    where the end user interacts with the application). The five instances of this
    continuum define the end-to-end information path starting with data collected
    by sensors up to commands executed by actuators. The five instances might not
    necessarily be present in all scenarios. Rather, depending on farm characteristics,
    requirements, and constraints, fog or cloud may not be present. This feature provides
    additional flexibility to the IoT-ML platform, as the differences are understood,
    and the platform adapts to the farm and not the opposite. Figure 1 depicts the
    IoT infrastructure for providing smart irrigation services, composed of core components
    and deployment locations. In smart agriculture, each farm has particular objectives
    and characteristics, so different deployment configurations may be used, representing
    instances of the same platform. Figure 1 presents a simpler version of the deployment
    of the IoT-ML platform where locations are thing, mist, cloud, and terminal (i.e.,
    no fog is used). This configuration was chosen for simplicity and a farmer''s
    choice of not hosting anyon-premises infrastructure. Figure 1. IoT-ML platform
    overview and end-to-end data path for a smart irrigation scenario. Show All In
    Fig. 1, the numbers in blue circles represent a simplified sequence of the end-to-end
    data flow through this deployment of the IoT-ML platform. Soil moisture sensors
    send data via LoRaWAN to the gateway installed in the mist node. Particularly
    for the SWAMP Project, we have built a custom-made three-depth soil moisture sensor,
    but also use commercial sensors from Libelium (www.libelium.com) and Meter (www.metergroup.com).
    A weather station also sends data to the mist node via a serial wired interface
    (1). From there, the mist node forwards data via 4G through the Internet directly
    to the cloud (2). Within the cloud, sensor data are treated by the LoRaWAN server
    and sent to the IoT protocol translator (3), such as a FIWARE IoT Agent. Weather
    data goes directly to the IoT protocol translator using the Ultralight 2.0 protocol,
    as well as weather forecasts obtained from an external service. The Translator
    converts the three different types of input data – soil, weather conditions, and
    weather forecast – into the format of the particular IoT underlying platform transmitting
    them to the context broker (4) (e.g., NGSI JSON format for FIWARE Orion). Once
    data arrives at the context broker, it is forwarded to time series storage (5)
    that makes it available for further processing (e.g., FIWARE QuantumLeap using
    CrateDB), where the first part of the end-to-end data flow ends. Here, depending
    on the volume and velocity of data, the time series storage may be replaced by
    a distributed data pipeline (e.g., Apache Kafka) connected to a big data processing
    system (e.g., Apache Spark). However, for most smart agriculture scenarios dealing
    with individual farms with hundreds of sensors, time series storage is a lightweight
    solution that provides adequate performance. The water need estimation component
    obtains soil moisture, weather conditions, and weather forecast data from the
    time series storage (6) to generate ideal crop water need estimates. Water need
    estimation is further divided into physical and ML models, further explained in
    the next section. The estimates are in turn used by irrigation planning to generate
    an optimized and real plan that is aware of different physical and financial constraints
    (7). Farmers are shown the irrigation plan via the Farmer App (8) and approve
    or change the irrigation plan that is sent back to irrigation operation (9), which
    controls the irrigation system. From there, irrigation commands follow the way
    back to the mist going through the context broker (10), IoT protocol translator
    (11), and Inter-net/4G (12). Finally, irrigation commands reach sprinklers, pumps,
    and valves (13). Should the fog be present in a different scenario, the end-to-end
    communication would be preserved with small changes, as some components would
    be deployed on-premises in the farm office where the fog node is located, such
    as the LoRaWAN server. This scenario includes the direct operation of the irrigation
    system. In alternative scenarios, the irrigation plan either interacts with existing
    third-party irrigation systems (e.g., Netafim – www.netafim.com – or Focking –
    www.fockink.ind.br) already installed on the farm or even used by farmers to operate
    the irrigation systems manually. These options for interacting with an irrigation
    system are common, and we assume they are generic enough to represent an IoT ecosystem
    for smart irrigation. Flexible Data-Driven Soil Water Management Over the last
    decades, data-driven soil water management has been accomplished using physical
    models3 or triggering soil moisture sensors data4 [7]. However, as IoT enables
    more abundant data, with major spatial and temporal granularity and low latency,
    it increasingly allows the rise of data-driven approaches. Here, a key challenge
    is how to make all analytical techniques (e.g., physical models and ML) available
    to work together in a flexible IoT platform, considering that each crop, type
    of soil, and region may demand a different solution. In this sense, our work aims
    to show the roles that these analytical techniques can play in soil water management,
    and how they can be flexibly assembled together. Our approach is based on two
    main characteristics: Solution flexibility: Modularized components are integrated
    as services in the IoT platform, allowing solution flexibility. Increased ML relevance:
    Analytical solutions can be assembled from traditional physical approaches, and
    modern ML and simulation ones, and even by combining them. Benefits of this approach
    are not only improved irrigation plans, but also self-improved platforms that
    learn from experience. Soil water management is performed in two phases, namely
    water need estimation and irrigation planning. Water Need Estimation The precision
    irrigation problem can be modeled as the soil water balance system at the root
    zone, where the soil water content is the result of the balance between water
    content level and a series of mechanisms that make this level increase or decrease
    (soil water dynamics) [8]. IoT provides the ability to monitor water content levels
    and dynamics, while soil water management systems seek to maintain water content
    in an optimal range [7]. Figure 2 depicts the water need estimation process, divided
    into two key activities: Soil water content and dynamics estimation: This consists
    of estimating soil water content and dynamics through: Direct measurement of soil
    water content, rainfall, irrigation, and so on Physical models of soil water dynamics
    applied over the collected data (weather data mainly) and soil and crop characteristics
    Soil water need forecast: This consists of calculating soil water content forecasts
    and water need forecasts for each moment of a planning horizon, using techniques
    such as simulation and ML algorithms: Simulation is appropriated when working
    with physical models, iteratively applied to simulate future data points [9].
    ML takes advantage of data from multiple time series (soil moisture, soil water
    balance, soil characteristics, and weather data) of direct sensor readings or
    from variables derived out of physical models. Weather forecast data, provided
    by external services, can also be used. Different multivariate forecasting methods
    can be used to handle these multiple time series [10], [11]. Figure 2. Water need
    estimation process. Show All The process depicted in Fig. 2 allows flexibility
    once it allows different components combinations, as they are implemented as services
    in the platform. It is also possible to customize each combination, as they have
    numerous options inside them (i.e., different physical models and ML techniques).
    As an example, the SWAMP project provides two customized analytical solutions
    among all combination possibilities to fit the characteristics and needs of different
    pilots. One of them, called CRITERIA-1D [9], uses physical models and simulation,
    wherein soil water dynamics models (physical models) are the input to soil simulation
    that generates soil water content and water need forecasts. Another solution uses
    direct measurements, physical models, ML, and simulation, wherein the main input
    is direct measurement of soil moisture enriched by an evapotranspiration5 model
    (physical model) [7] as the main soil water balance contributor. ML techniques6,
    such as Panel VAR [10] and RNN-LSTM [11], are used for the processing of soil
    water content and water need forecasts, and simulation to test alternative irrigation
    scenarios. Note that the latter uses Panel VAR and RNN-LSTM, respectively, a traditional
    and a cutting-edge technique for time series, thus highlighting the solution flexibility
    in exploring different ML techniques as they gain relevance. Irrigation Planning
    and Operation The water need estimation models provide what can be called the
    ideal irrigation. There are, however, other aspects that need to be considered
    when conceiving an actual irrigation plan, that is, a plan that can be put in
    place in the farm, which include: Water availability: Water scarcity is a problem
    in various parts of the planet. Water quotas or supply schedules might not allow
    the ideal amount of water to be irrigated in time. If the needed amount of water
    is not available, the irrigation plan should allocate the existing water so that
    the best economic return to the farmer is achieved. Costs of irrigation: Even
    if the water comes from private reservoirs, irrigation is not free. Pumping the
    water to the fields consumes energy, and its cost has an impact on the farmer''s
    bottom line. For example, in certain regions of Brazil, the energy bill can account
    for up to 30 percent of the production cost. A cost-aware plan should avoid irrigation
    when tariffs are higher. Limitation of the irrigation systems: Irrigation methods
    differ in how much of the irrigated water actually reaches the plants: furrow
    irrigation has 60 percent efficiency, while sprinkler irrigation reaches 75 percent
    [12]. Other aspects of the irrigation infrastructure need to be considered when
    planning: maximum pumping capacity of the farm, uniformity of irrigation, and
    soil variability, among others. Figure 3 presents a modular approach that separates
    irrigation planning from operation, completing the data flow shown in Fig. 2.
    There are three main modules: Irrigation planning: Computes the timing and water
    volume of irrigation events that best address the crop needs, while being aware
    of operational constraints and economic interests. Linear and nonlinear programming
    techniques can be used, as well as approximate solutions such as those provided
    by metaheuristics [13]. Irrigation operation: Communicates with the sensors and
    actuators installed in the farms, sending commands and monitoring the operation
    to ensure adherence to the plan. It controls the opening and closing of valves,
    the pressure at pumps, and so on, using the underlying IoT communication infrastructure
    to send commands. The use of standard IoT interfaces and protocols enables on-demand
    addition of sensors and actuators, smoothing the transition toward fully automated
    irrigation. System Model: Computes an updated model of the system behavior as
    far as irrigation is concerned. IoT devices (e.g., soil sensors, water meters)
    in combination with data-driven techniques enable estimating the actual irrigation
    efficiency, and planning accordingly. Figure 3. General data flow between irrigation
    services. Show All Discussion and Lessons Learned Physical Models vs. Machine
    Learning The increasing use of IoT in precision irrigation brings spatial and
    temporal accuracy gain, as sensors can potentially be placed in all manageable
    locations on a farm. Thus, site-specific particularities can easily be considered,
    leveraging the exploration of data-driven approaches. In this context, the question
    of what would be the right combination of techniques to deliver adequate soil
    water management emerges. Do traditional approaches, such as using physical models
    or triggering soil moisture sensors data [7], still take place? Or is this the
    time to avoid physical models and use cutting-edge ML algorithms acting directly
    to data? Our vision is that there is no unique ideal analytical approach for all
    cases, as crops differ significantly in irrigation methods and in crop, soil,
    and regional weather characteristics. More than that, depending on crop culture
    or region, not all data features might be available or cost-effective. However,
    a discussion of the roles traditional and ML approaches can play in effective
    solutions can provide guidelines to discern the most appropriate alternatives
    to each application case. Physical models have been extensively used in irrigation,
    bringing implicit agronomic knowledge, as they connect raw data features to specific
    and relevant features. Nevertheless, there are important limitations, as general
    models involve simplifications that often ignore local particularities, while
    site-specific models work well only regionally, and few models have adequate performance
    levels for different regions. Finally, the few models of general application that
    are flexible enough to address different conditions [7] are often complex and
    require many data features that are difficult to obtain. On the other hand, pure
    ML approaches applied directly to IoT data seem promising, as cutting-edge deep
    learning is capable of capturing implicit knowledge from raw data in many application
    areas, as well as delivering highly customizable results [14]. For this reason,
    we believe that ML approaches will be extensively explored in scientific research
    in the coming years, allowing the emergence of truly cognitive smart irrigation
    systems. As such, our architecture approach, based on core components and deployment
    locations, gives the necessary flexibility not only to build customizable IoT-ML
    solutions, but also to assemble customizable data-driven solutions. For smart
    irrigation, we have shown that it is possible to use various combinations of analytical
    tools, including mixes of physical models, simulation (traditional approaches),
    and ML techniques. As ML gains momentum, existing physical models may lose room
    because ML could implicitly capture from raw data the same information physical
    models provide. Instead, IoT''s continuous growth might enhance the utilization
    of physical models, as they can calculate their outputs with better spatial and
    temporal granularity. Also, IoT tends to promote not only physical models but
    also ML. In summary, a futuristic vision may be that ML is well positioned for
    IoT-based applications. However, although ML seems to have a promising future
    for smart irrigation, we are still at the beginning of its exploration, and we
    need reliable data that now is still generated by physical models or a combination
    of data and ML techniques. All in all, considering the advantages and disadvantages
    of each side, we advocate that current solutions consider using both physical
    models and ML algorithms – physical models serving as feature engineering for
    ML approaches. We believe that physical models can aggregate agronomic knowledge
    that ML algorithms eventually cannot capture yet directly from raw data. Finally,
    as different physical models can potentially capture different aspects of reality,
    we recommend using multiple physical models, even for similar tasks. Then ML will
    hold the task of capturing valuable information from the features provided by
    the physical models to deliver more precise water need estimation. Integrating
    Different Stakeholders The approach taken is the result of a joint and largely
    interdisciplinary effort, and the authors'' ambition is to generate an impact
    on a wide community of stakeholders with the envisioned innovation. On one hand,
    the interoperability at the communication level provided by IoT is a key factor
    to promote a platform culture among not-computer-scientists, as it brings easy
    node deployment, data collection, and inter-researcher interaction. On the other
    hand, only with our flexible architecture approach due to the heterogeneities
    embedded in the agricultural scenario – heterogeneity of devices and simulation
    tools, but also farms and the stakeholders themselves – can the barriers be properly
    handled. Different stakeholders speak their own languages: for example, soil-moisture
    sensor data are numbers for computer scientists, bits for telecommunication professionals,
    voltage signals for electronic engineers, while the end users expect volumetric
    soil moisture values. As the calibration of these sensors is soil-type-dependent,
    geologists, agronomists, and other researchers must take part in the game of this
    context-dependent calibration process. Altogether, the smooth interplay between
    actors with different skills and habits is a key success factor. Each stakeholder
    needs specific and mostly mobile services, with the appropriate human-machine
    interface, if we want to deploy the appropriate level of automation with the man
    in the loop, as required in today''s agriculture. Services need to be organized
    like a chain of tools that mutually exchange information and understand each other
    thanks to a shared information model based on emerging ontologies. This shared
    data model fosters smooth and sustainable innovation because the tool chain may
    easily be extended to provide new capabilities and value propositions, and attract
    new stakeholders. Impacts For IoT Professionals Our approach incorporates the
    ML pipeline into the IoT continuum by using a structure of services deployed as
    containers that exchange messages through the FIWARE NGSI unified data model.
    This scheme impacts IoT platform development and deployment in many aspects: Automation:
    The platform provides a subscribe/notify mechanism for building automated data
    pipelines. Traceability: The storing of meta-data information about the model
    specifications and context of data used in the estimation allows keeping track
    of model forecasts, as well as quality indicators. Pluggability: The integration
    of new or updated models is facilitated by the unified data model, consuming data
    and producing water need estimates in a standard way. Flexibility: The pluggability
    allows IoT professionals to compose different data workflows flexibly by using
    various components. Hybrid environments: The architecture allows the use of different
    ML frameworks to train models, as well as hardcoded physical models. All these
    aspects have been allowing a relatively simple deployment of our platform in all
    SWAMP pilots, each one with its characteristics and different specific goals.
    In Italy, the goal is to use farm data for water management and distribution (i.e.,
    to share data outside the farm to create an even bigger system-of-systems). In
    Spain, the goal is to explore the limits of flexibility and precision in irrigation
    by going into a very fine-grained irrigation system where each sprinkler is an
    IoT node. In Bahia, Brazil, there is a large-scale use case with huge center-pivot
    irrigation systems, where the goal is to decrease operational costs through improved
    situational awareness. Near São Paulo, Brazil, the goal is to improve the quality
    of grapes and wine. For Farmers Currently, in modern farms that rely on physical
    water need estimation models and respect soil variability, farmers are provided
    with irrigation plans for long periods, such as weeks, months, or even the entire
    season. Based on their accumulated experience and daily work in the field, they
    continuously adapt the irrigation plan to avoid crops suffering from water stress.
    In this scenario, the irrigation plan plays the role of an offline longer-term
    forecast that needs to be fitted into the reality of the farm. In a fully automated
    future agriculture scenario, the IoT-based smart irrigation system will precisely
    control every aspect of the use of water, adapting it to shorter-term periods
    according to instantaneous information coming from the field, which can be daily
    or even based on intra-day micro adjustments in the irrigation plan. Between these
    two scenarios – current and future – lies a new IoT-enabled reality that will
    change the way farmers face irrigation. In any case, a requirement is that farmers
    always control the irrigation and are provided a wealth of real-time information
    to be able to make better decisions. To this end, we developed a smartphone app
    (Fig. 4) where farmers are informed of immediate water needs (Fig. 4a), measured
    and forecast water balance time series (Figure 4b), and the current soil moisture
    information for a 3-depth sensor probe (Fig. 4c). With this real-time status of
    the farm at hand, and equipped with the optimized irrigation plans computed by
    the system, the farmer can achieve better use of the water resources without harming
    productivity. Figure 4. Farmer application screenshots. Show All As the system
    reliability and precision increase and earn the trust of farmers, they can slowly
    give more power to the system to make automated decisions. In other words, the
    application will allow farmers to express policies on how to behave whenever a
    new irrigation plan is generated. Conclusion In this article, we present our flexible
    IoT-ML platform and highlight its scientific contribution over related work. The
    platform allows easy solution deployment involving IoT and ML components working
    in an application. Our real case is a smart irrigation application, where we exemplify
    how a solution can be built and customized depending on site-specific needs. Special
    attention was given to how the platform enables more exploration of ML-based solutions
    and on how it can positively impact IoT professionals'' and farmers'' needs. SWAMP
    project pilots have just been deployed; they are operating properly, and data
    is being collected. The next step, expected by the end of 2020, is to analyze
    the data and disseminate quantitative impact results. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This research

    rights and content Abstract: Recent technological and commercial developments
    make cloud computing an affordable, scalable, and highly-available platform technology.
    Meanwhile, precision agriculture is showing its potentials by improving agricultural
    operations through better data-driven decision making. Nevertheless, further development
    of precision agriculture requires better technology and tools to process data
    efficiently at a reasonable cost, and to translate the data to better decisions
    and actions in a field. We developed a framework for cloud-based Decision Support
    and Automation systems that can acquire data from various sources, synthesize
    application-specific decisions, and control field devices from the Cloud. A distinctive
    feature of our framework is its extensible software architecture: decision modules
    can be added and/or configured for a specific operation. The platform features
    a device-agnostic frontend that can process incoming data in different formats
    and semantics. Finally, the platform incorporates software-defined control, a
    new software design paradigm we proposed to enable versatile and safe control
    of field devices from a cloud computing platform. An early version of the system
    has been developed and tested with support from the USDA. Previous article in

    widely used around the world to fill the need of crop watering. This method of
    irrigation has a low efficiency compared to other methods of irrigation such as
    drip systems and generally they use water without consider the real need of plants.
    In this paper we propose an automation system based on the Internet of Things
    (IoT), Geographic Information System (GIS) and quasi real-time in the cloud of
    water requirements to improve the efficiency of water use. Indeed, each segment
    of the pivot-center moves at a different speed compared to others; thus, must
    be individually controlled to optimize the yield of irrigation. Moreover, it necessary
    to integrate factors such as stage of crops'' development, heterogeneity of soil,
    runoff, drainage, soil components, nutrients and moisture content. In this paper
    we develop a complete system integrating sensors, GIS, Internet of Things and
    cloud computing. This approach allows to automate fine-grained the consumption
    of water without decreasing the yield. In addition to that, the collect of data
    and the soil moisture measurement will allow to adapt coefficient of evapotranspiration
    to local weather without having to resort to lysimetric measures. The proposed
    architecture allows to store and treat real-time, time series data and low-priority
    data such as 3D images used in digital phenotyping field which are treated with
    batch processing. Published in: 2018 International Conference on Advanced Communication

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Marrakech, Morocco I. Introduction The demand
    of food production and fiber increase with de world population. The irrigation
    management is important particularly in context where the fresh water resources
    are limited. The aim of the irrigation is to give to plants the adequate amount
    of water to ensure their water requirements. The use of Water Production Function
    (WPF) allows to estimate the production in terms of dry matter or marketable yield,
    evapotranspiration ore the amount of applied water during irrigation (IW). According
    to the different production functions of IW may also include different components
    in addition to Crop Water Requirement (CWR), such as pre-planting irrigation to
    prepare the seeding, leaching requirement to decrease the salinity, rise of water
    table by capillarity and rainfall. Sign in to Continue Reading Authors Figures

    \ introduces a new way of managing water in irrigation systems, which can\nbe\
    \ applied to gardens or agricultural ﬁelds, replacing human intervention with\
    \ Wireless Sensor\nNetworks. A typical irrigation system wastes on average 30%\
    \ of the water used, due to poor\nmanagement and conﬁguration. This sustainable\
    \ irrigation system allows a better efﬁciency in the\nprocess of irrigation that\
    \ can lead to savings for the end user, not only monetary but also in natural\n\
    resources, such as water and energy, leading to a more sustainable environment.\
    \ The system can\nretrieve real time data and use them to determinate the correct\
    \ amount of water to be used in a garden.\nWith this solution, it is possible\
    \ to save up to 34% of water when using sensor data from temperature,\nhumidity\
    \ and soil moisture, or up to 26% when using only temperature inputs. Besides\
    \ a detailed\nsystem architecture, this paper includes a real case scenario implementation\
    \ and results discussion.\nKeywords: Internet of Things; Wireless Sensor Networks;\
    \ sustainability; LoRa; ESP32; water savings\n1. Introduction\nResearch and implementation\
    \ in the Internet-of-Things (IoT) ﬁelds and in topics such as Smart\nCities, Agriculture\
    \ and Sustainability have been growing in the past years [1].\nAs S. Routray [2]\
    \ said “Green technologies and energy efﬁcient process in IoT are well researched\n\
    areas in which optimization of resources takes the central position”. IoT is impacting\
    \ the world,\ncreating new markets and innovation, as it connects a wide range\
    \ of networks in both economy and\nsociety, requiring innovation in information,\
    \ communications and regulations [3]. This emerging\nconcept aims to disruptively\
    \ enhance the efﬁciency, sustainability, and safety of cities, with integrated\n\
    infrastructure and services, that allows a monitoring and management using intelligent\
    \ devices and\nsystems [4,5].\nA big part of cities nowadays is their focus on\
    \ creating green spaces, not only for their recreational\npurpose, but also because\
    \ it helps reduce the carbon footprint and overall temperatures of cities,\nbut\
    \ the maintenance of those spaces includes usage of huge amounts of water.\nAutomatic\
    \ irrigation solutions, based on manual conﬁgured controllers, composed of timers\n\
    and irrigate every day at the same time and duration, are the basic solution and\
    \ the go-to choice\nwhen building a new garden. This type of solution is still\
    \ the main choice in around 80% of the\nirrigation projects due to low prices\
    \ and simplicity, but this type of solution has a poor efﬁciency when\nit comes\
    \ to water management; it is common to see them start the irrigation process in\
    \ periods of rain,\nSensors 2019, 20, 1402; doi:10.3390/s20051402\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\n\
    Sensors 2019, 20, 1402\n2 of 14\nexcessive heat or strong winds, conditions that\
    \ contribute to the waste of water. Further, this type of\nsolution is unable\
    \ to understand if problems with the system, such as pipe leaks or broken valves,\n\
    occur, contributing to garden ﬂooding, not only killing the garden but also making\
    \ it inaccessible\nto users.\nSustainability is nowadays directly linked to innovation,\
    \ since all around the world, people are\nbecoming more concerned with climate\
    \ changes, water shortage, clean energies and other challenges\nthat require the\
    \ development of new products, business and services that can lead to advances\
    \ not only\nin environmental dimensions but also in social and economic dimensions\
    \ [3]. Only with innovation we\nare able to ﬁght the ongoing process where natural\
    \ resources, such as water, are starting to vanish and\nmaterial goods prices,\
    \ like energy, are at an all-time highs. Combining IoT, sustainability and Machine\n\
    Learning algorithms is possible to create more efﬁcient processes and achieve\
    \ a disruptive innovation\nthat in the medium to long term will allow consumption\
    \ reduction in natural and material resources.\nAt this moment, water shortage\
    \ is something that is rising every day, affecting more and more\npeople. Approximately\
    \ 70% of the fresh water used in many parts of the world is going for irrigation\n\
    related activities, from agricultural ﬁelds to gardens, and according to [6],\
    \ 30% of this water is being\npotentially wasted due to environmental conditions\
    \ or from the cycles not being optimized for the\ntypes of plants. This waste\
    \ is not only inﬂuencing the costs for the consumer but also is reducing the\n\
    health of the ﬁelds, in either under or over irrigation.\nTo achieve the goal\
    \ of reducing the waste of water in irrigation systems, disruptive solutions need\n\
    to be the go-to solutions. Instead of another smart irrigation controller, our\
    \ solution is a Sustainable\nIrrigation Solution, that not only controls the irrigation\
    \ system, but also analyzes all the system\ncomponents, from the pipes that supply\
    \ the water to the sprinklers, in order to analyze potential leaks\nor malfunctions,\
    \ improving efﬁciency and reducing costs in a sustainable and circular economy\
    \ fashion.\nUsing Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), directly in the garden to collect\
    \ real time data to\ncheck the current conditions of the garden and crossing these\
    \ information with weather forecast,\nevapotranspiration and garden speciﬁcations,\
    \ our proposed solution is able, through artiﬁcial\nintelligence algorithms, to\
    \ predict/calculate the real water needs for that particular garden and\nadjust\
    \ the irrigation controller without human interaction. It is also able to detect\
    \ how weather\nconditions, such as rain or strong winds, may affect the irrigation\
    \ process, scheduling the best time to\nstart. We stand out from other solutions\
    \ is that we do this analysis per irrigation zone and not in the\ngarden as a\
    \ whole, since gardens can have different characteristics in their constitution,\
    \ having also\ndifferent hydric needs.\nCombining this real time analysis with\
    \ the use of the correct irrigation times, the detection of\nsystem malfunctions\
    \ in the pipes and other materials, and the ability to control the entire system\n\
    remotely through a mobile dashboard, we are able to reduce the waste of water\
    \ in up to 30%, but also\nreduce the costs of installation and maintenance.\n\
    In this paper, an extended version of a previous paper published by the authors\
    \ [7] is presented,\nwith a more detailed and novel description of a system based\
    \ on WSN for retrieving real time\nenvironmental data in order to optimize irrigation\
    \ timings. A larger test case is described, with more\ntest scenarios, followed\
    \ by new experimental results and a comparison with previous ones. Finally,\n\
    the main conclusions and future work are also presented.\n2. Related Work\nAs\
    \ presented in the previous research,\nmany projects [8–11] have been published.\n\
    These implementations for IoT solutions that control irrigation systems, mainly\
    \ using single nodes\nwith Arduinos, combined with a set of environmental data\
    \ sensors, have several problems due to the\nlarge amounts of wire used to spread\
    \ them across the ﬁelds. All these projects use the collected data to\nincrease\
    \ the garden or agricultural ﬁeld efﬁciency, including user comfort and water\
    \ savings, but lack\nthe ability to be implemented in a real case scenario.\n\
    Sensors 2019, 20, 1402\n3 of 14\nMore advanced projects were also found [12–16]\
    \ where full WSNs are used to automatically turn\non the irrigation system when\
    \ low levels of soil moisture are detected. Although some good results\ncan be\
    \ found, none works with the goal of water management.\nIn terms of real water\
    \ management, and not only turning the irrigation off when the soil is still\n\
    moist, not many works were found. The SWAMP project, by C. Kamienski [17–19],\
    \ was the main\nresearch found. The project consists of a full system, from software\
    \ to hardware, that includes the use\nof sensors, drones and weather stations\
    \ to retrieve data, LoRa and MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry\nTransport) to transmit\
    \ data and a set of models to adapt these values to create the best irrigation\n\
    process for precision agriculture.\nOur proposal, already tested on a small scale\
    \ in a previous research [7], stands out from the others\nby the use of algorithms\
    \ capable of analyzing the environmental data and understanding the correct\n\
    amount of water needed for the ﬁeld, instead of watering only when moisture is\
    \ low. This allowed\nfor savings of around 25%. Even so, the previously presented\
    \ systems lack some reliability, mainly in\nthe chosen sensors, and needed to\
    \ be tested in a larger scenario. In order to improve the results and\nguarantee\
    \ that the solution works in multiple environments, we present an improved proposal,\
    \ with a\nmore reliable WSN.\n3. Materials and Methods\nIn order to achieve the\
    \ goal of collecting garden information in real time, the proposed solution,\n\
    bearing in mind the WSN fashion, is composed of a set of hardware nodes, responsible\
    \ for the\ncollection of sensor data, which communicate among each other using\
    \ LoRa [20] and with the server\nvia MQTT [21] over WiFi. Then, a set of Software\
    \ algorithms complements the network to store and\nanalyze the collected data.\n\
    The system architecture is based on a WSN that was previously developed and tested\
    \ in several\nscenarios by the authors [7,22–24]. The WSN is composed of a set\
    \ of two different nodes, each with\ntheir responsibilities and features:\n•\n\
    The aggregation node: a single gateway, responsible for maintaining the connected\
    \ network and\ncommunicate with the server. It is responsible for receiving the\
    \ messages sent from the sensor\nnodes and sending them to the server.\n•\nThe\
    \ sensor nodes: multiple nodes, responsible for collecting sensor information\
    \ and then\ntransmitting them the server to be analyzed.\nA high-level view of\
    \ the system architecture can be seen in Figure 1.\nFigure 1. System Architecture\
    \ [7] c⃝2019 IEEE.\n3.1. Hardware\nAs described by the authors in their previous\
    \ research [7,22–24], each node is composed of an\nESP32 ultra-low-power consumption\
    \ microcontroller, with built-in WiFi and the ability to connect\nup to 18 analog\
    \ sensors through its 12-bit Analogic Digital Converters (ADCs) [25], and an RFM95W,\n\
    a transceiver LoRa radio module capable of creating encrypted multi-point network,\
    \ that can\ncommunicate up to 2000 meters [26]. An 868MHz dipole ﬂexible antenna\
    \ is part of the hardware that\nforms the nodes.\nSensors 2019, 20, 1402\n4 of\
    \ 14\nAlthough the same hardware is used on both types of nodes, aggregation and\
    \ sensors, each has\nspeciﬁc characteristics. The built-in ESP32 WiFi connection\
    \ is used by the aggregation node, however,\nin the sensor node, no WiFi connection\
    \ is used, which allows this node to use the deep-sleep in order\nto run on batteries\
    \ for a longer period of time, on a low-power fashion. The other difference from\
    \ the\nnodes is that the sensor node is complemented with an array of sensors,\
    \ composed of:\n•\nSensirion SHT30-DIS-P2.5KS: a high accurate and reliable sensor,\
    \ capable of retrieving\ntemperature and air humidity with an accuracy of ±0.1\
    \ ◦C and ±1.5%, respectively, via an\nInter-Integrated Circuit (I2C), was the\
    \ perfect solution for our speciﬁcations, since it is low-cost,\nhas a low power\
    \ consumption with only 1.7 µA on average, and is easy to install and to retrieve\n\
    data [27]. This sensor is a huge improvement when facing the DHT22 used before\
    \ by the authors\nin [7], not only in terms of power consumption and size but\
    \ also has a better accuracy;\n•\nCapacitive moisture sensor: works by measuring\
    \ the capacitance changes between the dielectric\nplates, and is capable of detecting\
    \ the amount of water in the soil. The advantages of these types\nof sensors,\
    \ not only include a better reading of soil moisture, but also avoid corrosion.\n\
    Both types of nodes are enclosed in an IP68 box, as shown in Figure 2, to guarantee\
    \ that\nenvironmental conditions such as rain, wind, heat or dust and wildlife,\
    \ do not damage the electronics\nwhen placed in the implementation environment.\n\
    Figure 2. Smart Node.\nThe system was developed to be power efﬁcient and run on\
    \ batteries for a long period of time,\nwhile being able to collect and transmit\
    \ information. In this case, only the sensor node can be powered\nby batteries,\
    \ since it is the only one that enters in deep sleep after collecting and transmitting\
    \ the sensor\ndata. The aggregation node, since it needs to always be listening\
    \ to new sensor messages, is powered\nby a 5 V power adapter and a voltage regulator.\n\
    The sensor node power consumption in its life cycle can be found in Table 1.\n\
    Table 1. Sensor node power consumption.\nNode Status\nPower Consumption VIN =\
    \ 3 V\nTransmitting\n80 mA\nCollecting data\n20 mA\nDeep Sleep\n100 µA\nSince\
    \ the sensor node is in deep sleep mode for almost 90% of each collecting cycle,\
    \ and due to the\ncomponents chosen, the node can be powered by 2 AA batteries,\
    \ as shown in Figure 2, for long periods\nof time. Table 2 presents the expected\
    \ life-cycle of the batteries, based on real tests, depending on the\ninterval\
    \ between sample collection.\nSensors 2019, 20, 1402\n5 of 14\nTable 2. Sensor\

    The proposed hardware architecture for the WSN meets the requirements of the current\
    \ IoT\nsystems and proves to be an optimization from the current solutions on\
    \ the market, since it is able to\nadapt to multiple situations, as shown by the\
    \ authors in their previous research and tests [7,22–24].\nBesides that, the ability\
    \ to perform in a low-power scheme and also adapt the consumptions to the\nuser\
    \ needs, allows the system to be very reliable in terms of battery replacements.\n\
    The proposed system can support a network of up to 250 nodes, with bigger networks\
    \ not\ncompromising the reliability of the system nor giving extra work in the\
    \ implementation, since the\nnodes are conﬁgured automatically inside the network\
    \ when booting for the ﬁrst time.\n3.2. Communication\nCommunication is the most\
    \ important part of a WSN, being responsible not only for transmitting\nthe collected\
    \ data, but also to keep the network connected, create reliability and guarantee\
    \ that the\nsystem can perform the tasks that were speciﬁed. In a WSN, communication\
    \ also helps improve the\ncoverage of the implementation environment, mainly with\
    \ new protocols, such as LoRa or SigFox,\nallowing the network to expand up to\
    \ 5 km.\nAlthough only two types of nodes exist in the network, two communication\
    \ protocols are required\nto allow the network to work, since an intra-network\
    \ communication for communication between the\nnetwork nodes, and an Internet\
    \ communication to send data to the servers, are needed. Both networks\nwill be\
    \ described in the next sections.\n3.2.1. Node-to-Node Communication\nThis is\
    \ how information is exchanged inside the WSN, from sensor information to actuator\
    \ actions.\nSince nodes can be far from each other, and as some of the nodes are\
    \ powered by batteries, a wireless\ncommunication capable of long-range transmissions\
    \ with low power consumption is needed.\nLoRa, due to its long range and low power\
    \ consumption and also the fact that it works\non an unlicensed radio spectrum\
    \ [20], meaning that no costs are associated, was the chosen\ncommunication standard\
    \ to connect the WSN. With the ability to eliminate repeaters, reduce device\n\
    cost, increase battery lifetime on devices, improve network capacity and support\
    \ a large number\nof devices, when facing other major communication protocols,\
    \ as is presented in Table 3 [20,28–41],\nmake LoRa the ideal solution to connect\
    \ our WSN.\nTable 3. Major Communication Wireless Protocols Characteristics.\n\

    \ bit\nHence, in order to connect all the network nodes, a LoRa peer-to-peer network\
    \ was implemented,\nusing the RFM95W radio transceiver. These modules, capable\
    \ of using the LoRa protocol, allow the\nSensors 2019, 20, 1402\n6 of 14\nnetwork\
    \ to cover up to 2 km with up to 256 nodes, with individual node addressing [26].\
    \ With the LoRa\nradio module only consuming 70 mA while transmitting and with\
    \ a sleep mode feature, they check all\nthe necessary speciﬁcations in terms of\
    \ node-to-node communication.\nFor conﬁguration and usage, the Arduino library\
    \ RadioHead [42] was used; this enables the node\naddressing, with a unique address\
    \ being chosen, guaranteeing that each node has its own address.\nThe nodes can\
    \ communicate in two different ways, both encrypted by the library:\n•\nBy sending\
    \ a message directly to a speciﬁc node, using its destination address;\n•\nSending\
    \ a broadcast message to every node in the network, including the destination\
    \ node ID\ninside the message.\nNetwork ﬁdelity is assured by the RadioHead library,\
    \ with the use of automatic acknowledgement\n(ACK) response to the node that sends\
    \ the message using its ID, as in the ﬁrst scenario. When a\nbroadcasting message\
    \ is sent, as for the second scenario, no ID is used and so, no ACK mechanism\
    \ is\nused by the library. To cope with this limitation, an ID is added to the\
    \ broadcasting message in order\nfor the receiving node to send an ACK response\
    \ to the transmitting node.\nThe ﬁrst scenario is usually used for the sensor\
    \ nodes to send data to the gateway, while when\nthe gateway send information\
    \ for the sensors or actuators, the second scenario is used.\n3.2.2. Node-to-Server\
    \ Communication\nThis is how information containing sensor data leaves the network\
    \ and actions are received.\nFor that, some sort of Internet connection is needed\
    \ to connect to the server, and since our core\nmicrocontroller, the ESP32, has\
    \ built-in WiFi, we use that functionality to transfer data.\nIn order to create\
    \ a constant low-power data connection, the MQTT protocol was adopted, due to\n\
    its high communication reach and the low power consumption, when compared to other\
    \ protocols.\nMQTT is a messaging protocol [43–45] built on top of the TCP protocol,\
    \ that uses a publish/subscribe\npattern, as shown in Figure 3, to provide ﬂexibility\
    \ and simplicity transition making MQTT an optimal\nconnection protocol for the\
    \ IoT and M2M, being suitable for small, cheap, low power and low memory\ndevices\
    \ with low bandwidth networks.\nFigure 3. MQTT architecture.\nTo implement this\
    \ protocol, it was necessary to deﬁne speciﬁc topics for each way of\ncommunication,\
    \ making it possible to distinguish between messages intended for the server and\n\
    those intended for the aggregation node:\n•\n“irrigation/network/in” – to send\
    \ messages to the server;\n•\n“irrigation/network/out” – messages whose destination\
    \ is the network.\nThe network, and particularly the aggregation node, subscribes\
    \ to the “irrigation/network/out”\ntopic and is constantly listening to new messages,\
    \ for example, action to turn on/off the irrigation.\nWhen a message is received\
    \ through the LoRa network from another node, for example, new sensor\ninformation,\
    \ the aggregation node publishes that message to the topic “irrigation/network/in”.\n\
    The server does the exact opposite, subscribing to the “irrigation/network/in”\
    \ to wait for new sensor\ninformation, and publishing to “irrigation/network/out”\
    \ when a new action is created.\nSensors 2019, 20, 1402\n7 of 14\n3.2.3. Security\n\
    As this will be implemented in real case scenarios, all the system communications\
    \ must be secure,\nincluding the radio transmissions and the MQTT messages. For\
    \ that, all messages are encrypted using\na private key.\n4. Implementation Scenario\n\
    To test if the solution can work to improve convectional irrigation system efﬁciency,\n\
    the implementation scenarios must contain a garden with an existing system. In\
    \ the work developed\npreviously by the authors in [7] a small garden with only\
    \ three irrigation zones was chosen, so now\nthe goal was to select a bigger garden,\
    \ with more diversiﬁcation of irrigation zones and also where\npeople usually\
    \ pass, in order to see if the system affects in any way the normal behaviour\
    \ of the garden.\nThe selected garden, as seen in Figure 4a, is a 2 ha public\
    \ garden with more than 60 irrigation zones,\nin Campo Grande, Lisbon.\n(a)\n\
    (b)\nFigure 4. (a) Satellite Image of the Garden; (b) Irrigation zones and sensor\
    \ implementation.\nSince it was difﬁcult to cover the entire garden with sensors,\
    \ the northern side of the garden\nwas chosen. As displayed in Figure 4b, this\
    \ part of the garden has eight irrigation zones, each with\napproximately 350\
    \ m2, and on four of them, we implement up to three sensor nodes, represented\
    \ as red\ndots, depending on size and type of plants. One aggregation node was\
    \ included in a nearby machine\nhouse, where a WiFi connection was available.\n\
    Figure 5a,b shows how the sensor nodes were implemented in the irrigation zones,\
    \ and mainly\nhow the soil moisture sensor is capable of analysing multiple depths.\n\
    As in the previous research, our system does not replace a convectional irrigation\
    \ system, in order\nto comprehend and compare the results with the use of real\
    \ time environmental data.\nTherefore, each sensor node ran for two months, in\
    \ June and July, retrieving air temperature,\nrelative humidity and soil moisture\
    \ every 4 h and sending them to the servers via the aggregation node.\nSensors\
    \ 2019, 20, 1402\n8 of 14\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 5. (a) Smart Node with Soil sensor;\
    \ (b) Irrigation zones and sensor implementation.\n5. Results\nThe system implementation\
    \ allowed the collection of about 320 valid samples per sensor node,\ncontaining\
    \ real time local information about the garden environmental parameters. Two sets\
    \ of\ncollected data can be seen in Figure 6, with 2 weeks in June represented\
    \ in Figure 6a and 2 weeks in\nJuly represented in Figure 6b.\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure\
    \ 6. Data collected: (a) 2 week June data; (b) 2 week July data.\nSensors 2019,\
    \ 20, 1402\n9 of 14\nThe ﬁrst thing to notice is that in the testing period, there\
    \ were no rain periods, and that irrigation\nwas mainly done when soil moisture\
    \ was below 30%, but it is also possible to notice that humidity\nlevels are high,\
    \ which helps the soil moisture to decrease more slowly, so the water used in\
    \ the\nirrigation can be less.\nIt was possible to understand that the sensors\
    \ spread throughout the garden do not have any\nimplications in the normal activities\
    \ in the garden, not harming the users, plants or do not even need\nto be removed\
    \ when maintenance occurs in the garden, such as mowing the grass.\nAnalysing\
    \ the obtained real time sensor data, it is possible to comprehend that these\
    \ data can\nhelp improve the efﬁciency of the irrigation system.\nThe real water\
    \ needs depend on the type of plants, the evapotranspiration, garden area, type\
    \ of\nvalves and tubing, distance between valves and the number of irrigations\
    \ per day. Considering all\nthese parameters, using Equation (1), it is possible\
    \ to calculate the real amount of water for that\nparticular garden.\nT = A ×\
    \ (Kc + ET) × 60\nF × N × 1000\n/P\n(1)\nwhere T is the irrigation time in minutes,\
    \ Kc is crop coefﬁcient, in this case for grass is 6 L/m2, F is\nthe outgoing\
    \ ﬂow of water per valve in m3/h, N the number of valves, P is the number of irrigation\n\
    periods, A is the garden area in m2, given by Equation (2)\nA = [(0.5 × N) − 1]\
    \ × D2\n(2)\nwhere D is the distance between the valves, and ET is the evapotranspiration\
    \ in mm/day, given by\nsimpliﬁed Hargreaves formula [46] shown in Equation (3)\n\
    ET = 0.0023 × (Tmed + 17.78)R0 × (Tmax − Tmin)0.5\n(3)\nwhere Tmed is the average\
    \ temperature, Tmax is the maximum temperature, Tmin is the minimum\ntemperature\
    \ and R0 is the incident extra-terrestrial solar radiation which, based on latitude\
    \ and time\nof the year, for Lisbon is about 17.1 mm/day.\nIt is possible to see\
    \ that the only parameter in which variations occur is the value of temperature,\n\
    both minimum and maximum, for a particular day. This is the ﬁrst evidence that\
    \ collecting local data\nis important.\nTo use as much of the collected environmental\
    \ data as we can and to create a more efﬁcient system,\nthe irrigation times formula\
    \ (Equation (1)) was adapted to take into consideration the last air humidity\n\
    and soil moisture values. This new formula, Equation (4), allows to have a more\
    \ precise irrigation time,\nsince it includes all the environmental data that\
    \ affect garden health.\nTopt = TIsoil × 0.7 + TIhum × 0.3 + T × 0.1\n(4)\nwhere\
    \ TIx is the time needed to reach 100% of the variable x, in this case soil moisture\
    \ (soil) and air\nhumidity (hum), given by Equation (5)\nTIx = T × (100 − Ix)\n\
    100\n(5)\nwhere Ix is the last value retrieved for the sensor x.\nThe weight of\
    \ each variable in the optimized formula can be adjusted from time to time, in\
    \ order\nto reach a more precise formula. This, in the future, will be done using\
    \ Machine Learning prediction\nalgorithms. The 0.1 added in the end, is a margin\
    \ of error, hence, the 1.1 total weight.\nConsidering the formulas obtained and\
    \ how much data we can input to get better results,\nthree analyses were done\
    \ and compared to the normal irrigation system, already implemented in the\ngarden:\n\
    Sensors 2019, 20, 1402\n10 of 14\n1.\nIrrigation system controlled by our solution\
    \ while using Equation (1) and forecast data to calculate\nthe irrigation times;\n\
    2.\nIrrigation system controlled by our solution while using Equation (1) and\
    \ sensor data to calculate\nthe irrigation times;\n3.\nIrrigation system controlled\
    \ by our solution while using the optimized Equation (1) and sensor\ndata to calculate\
    \ the irrigation times;\nWith these scenarios, not only are we able to check if\
    \ the use of sensor values can really help\nadjust the irrigation times but also\
    \ prove that locally retrieved data are better than weather forecast for\nthat\
    \ region.\nIn the ﬁrst scenario, the national Portuguese weather institute, IPMA\
    \ [47], weather information\nwas used, through their API, with the hourly temperature\
    \ and the higher and lowest values for relative\nhumidity for each day in the\
    \ garden location. The values were retrieved from the IPMA API everyday\nat midnight,\
    \ in order to get the values for the next 24 h.\nFigure 7 compares the IPMA weather\
    \ forecast data with the collected data from the sensor\nnetwork, and is possible\
    \ to understand that although they follow the same pattern, some variations\n\
    occur, that might affect the end result.\nFigure 7. IPMA vs Sensor data comparison.\n\
    In the remaining scenarios, only the sensor network information was used. When\
    \ an irrigation\nschedule approaches, the last needed values retrieved from the\
    \ 4 hour interval datapoints are used in\norder to calculate the needs based on\
    \ the most current conditions available.\nTable 4 shows the irrigation times for\
    \ each of the tested scenarios.\nTable 4. Average irrigation time per scenario.\n\
    Scenario\nAverage Irrigation Time (min)\nCurrent system\n42\n(1)\n33.6\n(2)\n\
    32.3\n(3)\n28.7\nThe obtained results shows that a viable solution that can reduce\
    \ the amount of water used due\nto the adoption of a sensor data approach, is\
    \ possible. To verify that by applying a solution based on\nthe sensor data retrieved\
    \ from the environment, the amount of time the valves are open are reduced,\n\
    meaning that the amount of water used will be lower while maintaining the garden\
    \ healthy.\nSensors 2019, 20, 1402\n11 of 14\nSince valves are open for a reduced\
    \ amount of time, less water will be used, while keeping the\ngarden healthy.\
    \ Equation (6) can be used to calculate the amount of water used based on the\
    \ time that\nthe valves need to be open.\nC = (F × N × 1000) × T\n60\n(6)\nThis\
    \ allows a comparison between the consumptions of the normal irrigation system\
    \ and the\ntheoretical consumptions of a system based on our solution. Table 5\
    \ shows the amount of water used\nin the scenarios described above.\nTable 5.\
    \ Water used per scenario.\nScenario\nWater Used (L/h)\nSavings\n(a)\n614376\n\
    -\n(b)\n463561\n24.55%\n(c)\n452017\n26.43%\n(c)\n401541\n34.64%\nWith these results,\
    \ it is possible to conclude two major results. Firstly, using data to set the\n\
    irrigation times allows a reduction in up to 34% of the water used to irrigate\
    \ a garden. This shows that\na proper analysis of the environment can help create\
    \ a more efﬁcient and sustainable irrigation service,\nnot only saving water but\
    \ also reducing the costs for the owner.\nBesides that, and bearing in mind the\
    \ goal of this paper of assessing if real time and local data can\noffer improvements\
    \ over historical or forecast data, it is possible to see that when using the\
    \ collected\ndata over the IPMA weather data, an improvement of almost 2% is possible.\
    \ This might seem like a\nlow improvement, but when we put it into perspective,\
    \ it relates to almost 10,000 L/h saved.\nFinally, it is possible to conclude\
    \ that when more parameters are used, the best results are obtained.\nUsing the\
    \ optimized Equation (1), that uses soil moisture and air humidity besides only\
    \ air temperature,\nwe get an 8% improvement facing the normal Equation (1).\n\
    Maintaining the irrigation hours, but using the real amount of water that the\
    \ garden needs,\nit is possible to get the same results in terms of soil moisture\
    \ and garden health, while reducing\nwater consumption.\n6. Conclusions\nIn this\
    \ article, the improvements done on a previous published research [7] are presented,\
    \ with the\nmain goal of creating a reliable WSN system to collect real time environmental\
    \ data to optimize\nirrigation times. This paper shows the hardware and software\
    \ improvements as well as the results\nfrom a new real case implementation in\
    \ a bigger garden and for a longer period of time.\nIn the previous research,\
    \ it was possible to conclude that the retrieved data were could be\nintroduced\
    \ in an intelligent and efﬁcient algorithm in order to predict a more accurate\
    \ irrigation\ntiming. It was also possible to understand that by keeping track\
    \ of environmental status, such as rain\nor high humidity values, it is possible\
    \ to detect if it is really necessary to irrigate. In that case study,\nan improvement\
    \ of 25% was achieved, although implementation was done in a small garden and\
    \ for\nonly 2 weeks.\nThe results from this new case study show again that using\
    \ local real time data is a big advantage\nwhen facing forecast and historical\
    \ data, with improvements of 2%. When using data facing a typical\nirrigation\
    \ system, the improvements go up to 26%, when using just temperature, and 34%\
    \ when\ncombining more sensor data, such as humidity and soil moisture.\nOnce\
    \ again, this number can be improved to reach 50% with some modiﬁcations to the\
    \ irrigation\nsystem, namely, the valves and tubing used as well as the application\
    \ layout.\nSensors 2019, 20, 1402\n12 of 14\nIt is also important to note that\
    \ the savings are theoretical, since the irrigation controller was\nnot changed.\
    \ It is possible to evaluate the real amount of water saved, since this can be\
    \ affected by\nnumerous situations.\nBy combining the sensor data gathered by\
    \ the WSN with Artiﬁcial Intelligence algorithms,\nit possible to conﬁgure, in\
    \ real time, the WSN to adapt to new conditions or speciﬁcations, but also\nachieve\
    \ a better efﬁciency in the process leading to savings for the ﬁnal user, not\
    \ only monetary but\nalso in natural resources, such as water and energy, leading\
    \ to a more sustainable environment.\nThe next step of this project is to use\
    \ Machine Learning in order to predict the future conditions\nof the garden and\
    \ prepare for drought periods or other environmental conditions that can affect\
    \ the\ngarden. We also aim to extend the application to agriculture, where there\
    \ is might be a large number\nof crops, each with different water needs that would\
    \ affect irrigation times.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, A.G. and\

    \ are helping to make water management smarter\nand optimizing consumption in\
    \ the smart agriculture industry. This article proposes a new topology\nof sensor\
    \ nodes based on the use of inexpensive and highly efﬁcient components, such as\
    \ water level,\nsoil moisture, temperature, humidity, and rain sensors. Additionally,\
    \ to guarantee good performance\nof the system, the used transmission module is\
    \ based on LoRa LPWAN technology. The design of the\nmain circuit board of the\
    \ system is optimized by combining two layers and implementing software\noptimization.\
    \ The overall sensor network is developed and tested in the research lab, and\
    \ real farms\ncan be controlled by users manually or automatically using the mobile\
    \ application. Experimental\nresults are produced by testing sensor and communication\
    \ link effectiveness, and are subsequently\nvalidated in the ﬁeld through a one-week\
    \ measurement campaign.\nKeywords: Internet of Things (IoT); water management;\
    \ smart agriculture; LoRa; LPWAN; sensor\n1. Introduction\nWireless sensor network\
    \ (WSN) technology, which is known as the center of the Internet of\nThings (IoT),\
    \ has continuously grown in recent years. An advantage of WSNs is their ability\
    \ to easily\ndeﬁne a network of devices that can be communicated with and gathered\
    \ from a monitored ﬁeld\nthrough communication links since the information is\
    \ sent through multiple nodes with a gateway and\nconnected to other networks\
    \ like wireless Ethernet. Many researchers have applied WSNs to different\nresearch\
    \ areas, such as environmental monitoring, forest ﬁre detection, smart cities,\
    \ smart education,\nhealthcare, agricultural control, water quality monitoring,\
    \ military uses, and asset management [1–9].\nAccordingly, WSNs are suitable for\
    \ multiple applications. The long range (LoRa) LPWAN is one\nnovel IoT communication\
    \ technology with an excellent capacity for development that is applied in\nmany\
    \ ﬁelds. The beneﬁts of this technology can be attributed to its capabilities\
    \ of ultra-long-distance\ncommunication, low power consumption, and ease of deployment,\
    \ among others.\nIn agriculture, environmental monitoring is required to control\
    \ speciﬁc plant conditions.\nBy collecting approximate values of available data\
    \ and making more accurate estimates, a WSN\ncan be used to achieve this task.\
    \ In addition, many agriculture researchers apply WSNs to monitor\nenvironmental\
    \ criteria [2–6]. In addition to standard environmental conditions such as temperature,\n\

    \ such as the ability to control the water level or temperature level are\nthe\
    \ subject of research in an agricultural environment [10].\nWater management and\
    \ optimal water supply have become popular topics in the ﬁeld of smart\nagriculture\
    \ and are being studied and developed by many researchers. Over the years, prominent\n\
    researchers in the ﬁeld of smart agriculture have written many survey articles\
    \ which introduce the\nresearch methodology for various communication technologies\
    \ that control resources efﬁciently based\non IoT technology [11–13]. We summarize\
    \ and compare our model with the existing literature in\nTable 1. In Vietnam,\
    \ agricultural production has transformed the country’s socioeconomic status\n\
    by alleviating national food insecurity, reducing poverty, fostering agrarian\
    \ exports, and providing\nlivelihoods to nearly half of the labor force nationwide.\
    \ These are just some examples, since WSN is\nactively applied to various functions\
    \ such as smart cities, waste management, and waste collection\nwith LoRaWan technology\
    \ [14–16].\nTable 1. A comparisons of our model with existing literature.\nModel\n\

    \ work on WSN in smart\nagriculture, clariﬁcations on issues of water management,\
    \ and essential tasks to be completed. Section 3\npresents details of the architecture\
    \ of the IoT proposed system. Section 4 presents the operational tests\ncomposed\
    \ of two different tasks, while Section 5 discusses the advantages and disadvantages\
    \ of our\npolicy. Finally, some concluding observations and a way forward are\
    \ offered in Section 6.\n2. Smart Agriculture and Related Works\nAs it possesses\
    \ the advantage of critical natural resources, Vietnam is an agricultural country\
    \ that\nis growing very quickly. Agriculture plays an essential role in the Vietnamese\
    \ economy and contributes\nto the country’s economic development currently and\
    \ in the future. Agriculture is one of the critical\nindustrial sectors of Vietnam,\
    \ and economic growth depends heavily on agriculture. The population of\nVietnam\
    \ will rise to reach 100 million people by 2020, while the demand for agricultural\
    \ products such\nas food crops (e.g., sweet potatoes, manioc, beans, and corn)\
    \ rice, coffee, pepper, cashew nut, rubber,\ntea, fruit, and vegetables continues\
    \ to increase dramatically. Combined with the effects of climate\nchange, these\
    \ demands place even more strain upon land, water, energy, and other resources\
    \ that are\nJ. Sens. Actuator Netw. 2019, 8, 45\n3 of 22\nalready inﬂuenced. Several\
    \ smart solutions can be co-optimized and scaled up to improve yields and\nmeet\
    \ growing food production demands while transporting power and water resources\
    \ efﬁciently [17].\nMany articles depict the close relationship between smart\
    \ agriculture and IoT/WSN.\nResearchers focus on how this high-tech improvement\
    \ can be employed to develop effective smart\nsystems and data transmission [8,18].\n\
    The authors of [18] present a SmartFarmNet framework, based on the IoT platform\
    \ that can\nautomate the collection of environmental, fertilizer, soil, and irrigation\
    \ data; automatically correlate\nthat data and evaluate product performance; and\
    \ calculate product estimates and suggest speciﬁc\nproducts for any particular\
    \ farm. Importantly, IoT devices can be integrated into this platform as\nsensors,\
    \ cameras, and weather stations. Produced data can then be saved in the cloud\
    \ to enable\nperformance analysis and and recommendations.\nWith the help of IEEE\
    \ 802.15.4, which is a suite of high-level communication technology, artiﬁcial\n\
    intelligence, and decision support technology, the authors of [19] have developed\
    \ research on the\nagricultural application of IoT technology to monitor real-time\
    \ moisture and nutrients of citrus, along\nwith an analysis of the combination\
    \ of fertilizer support systems and irrigation. However, this research\nhas weaknesses,\
    \ which include system complexity and high costs. The authors of [20] also present\n\
    a narrow-band radio channel model whereby the communication link transfers under\
    \ near-ground\nrequirements for a smart agriculture platform.\nThe solution presented\
    \ in [21] was developed by implementing machine learning applications\non agriculture\
    \ datasets for smart farm improvement. By employing and comparing numerous\nmachine\
    \ learning methods to recommend the best solution, this system enabled the investigation\n\
    and deployment of useful jobs, varying from crop yield forecasting to missing\
    \ or incorrect sensor\ndata reconstruction. However, the only reasonable application\
    \ for this scenario is smart agriculture,\nsince three different resources are\
    \ available: the CRN scientiﬁc dataset, Istat statistical dataset, and the\nIoT\
    \ sensor manufacturing dataset.\nMany researchers and developers have chosen microcontroller\
    \ boards (e.g., Arduino boards) or\nRaspberry Pi for IoT applications. These allow\
    \ real-time monitoring, collection, data management,\nsecurity, and remote control\
    \ functions using the mobile app because of the suitable platforms available\n\
    for Internet-connected sensor buttons. This option is often challenging because\
    \ it entails a trade-off\nbetween cost, performance, and functionality for each\
    \ speciﬁc application project. Water management\ninvolves a valuable resource.\
    \ If an attacker controlled the system, entire crops could be destroyed\ndue to\
    \ altered irrigation levels. A denial of service (DoS) attack on sensors, irrigation\
    \ actuators,\nor distribution systems could affect system-wide operations. Changes\
    \ to sensor settings may also\nissue a warning that could cause networks or decision\
    \ producers to perform illegal actions and yield\nmonths of efforts and production\
    \ aims. If an attacker gains control of the actuators, irrigation and\nwater distribution\
    \ may be compromised and result in the incorrect irrigation of certain products.\n\
    Furthermore, eavesdropping may give criminals access to secret data about the\
    \ farm. They could\nremove productivity information and even manipulate the commodity\
    \ business, which represents an\neven more signiﬁcant threat. Self-governing vehicles,\
    \ drones, and engines utilized to collect images or\ncontrol manufacturing must\
    \ also be kept classiﬁed. An unauthorized node in the network can send\nincorrect\
    \ information about a crop. However, the authors only present the challenges to\
    \ security in\nsmart agriculture, and do not discuss how to overcome challenges\
    \ [22].\nA smart agriculture system was constructed to use low-power Bluetooth\
    \ and LPWAN\ncommunication technologies, including the wire-based communication\
    \ technology used in the existing\nfarm in [23]. This was combined with microcontrollers\
    \ such as an Arduino UNO board or Raspberry Pi\nboard. The administrator receives\
    \ data from sensor connections, and then stores the data, analyzes it,\nand provides\
    \ a user interface to monitor it. A related study [24] explains how an approach\
    \ to using IoT\nand cloud computing that incorporates development is helping to\
    \ quickly modernize agriculture and\nto realize smart solutions for agriculture.\
    \ Moreover, to solve problems regarding more practical issues\nJ. Sens. Actuator\
    \ Netw. 2019, 8, 45\n4 of 22\nrelated to farmers, sensors can be applied for use\
    \ in the IoT system. Furthermore, 2G and 3G wireless\nbroadband networks can be\
    \ used for communication between other components in the IoT system.\nSeveral\
    \ enabling technologies are adapted to present smart platform projects, which\
    \ are able\nto collect and manage data handling problems related to water management\
    \ in smart agriculture.\nFor example, the SWAMP project is a platform architecture\
    \ that includes a scenario-based development\nprocess for the obtained systems\
    \ in [25]. Moreover, the platform develops and assesses smart water\nmanagement\
    \ for precision irrigation in agriculture with a practical method based on four\
    \ pilots in\nBrazil, Italy, and Spain. The structure of SWAMP can be developed\
    \ for different solutions to deal\nwith the requirements of different contexts,\
    \ countries, climates, soils, and crops. Indeed, considerable\nﬂexibility is required\
    \ to adapt to a range of deployment conﬁgurations, including a diverse mix of\n\
    technologies. Unfortunately, for this platform, it is not possible to use without\
    \ the license and to do\nthis. The different IoT smart platforms presented in\
    \ [26] propose the use of cloud-based technology\nto manage the collection, analysis,\
    \ and forecast of agricultural environmental information in one\nuniversal system.\
    \ Besides the introduction of the platform, the author of the paper also presented\
    \ LoRa\ncommunication and applied it to the studied network, and although details\
    \ were not provided on the\nhardware used to do this. In summary, both studies\
    \ presented interesting suggestions and suitable\nplatforms for application to\
    \ smart agriculture.\nOther authors have focused on completing a systematic literature\
    \ review of IoT research and\ndeployments in protected agriculture over the past\
    \ ten years, in which they evaluate the contributions\nmade by various researchers\
    \ and organizations. Moreover, the structure of IoT is also detailed in\nprotected\
    \ agriculture, including the used platforms, modern wireless technologies, cloud\
    \ computing,\nmachine learning, big data, animal farming, hardware, software challenges,\
    \ and so on [27].\nAnother paper [28] proposes an IoT idea-based solution for\
    \ smart farming, where the authors\nproposed stack and discuss the current improvements.\n\
    They mainly focus on the IoT/M2M\ninteraction and explain the design and development\
    \ of a gateway that discusses the provided\nservices. Notably, in [29], the Web\
    \ of Things (WoT) was proposed as an idea to use environmental\nmonitoring and\
    \ enhance agricultural practices by supporting decision-making based on bio-data\n\
    collection. The paper brieﬂy presents the original design, which is a middleware\
    \ platform for IoT\nthat performs separation by understanding opportunistic networking\
    \ and computing operations.\nAccordingly, it is able to detect and control environmental\
    \ targets using web-based technologies.\nMeanwhile, the use of IoT for smart precision\
    \ agriculture for rural areas is proposed in [30]. In this\npaper, the authors\
    \ focus on a scalable network architecture for real-time monitoring of agriculture\
    \ in\nrural areas. A possible strategy is to optimize each element of the system\
    \ to reduce system latency\nup to a particular area. A solution [31] was proposed\
    \ by implementing a framework for managing,\ninvestigating, and sharing groundwater\
    \ data, with the use of sensors to gather data on groundwater\nlevels, pump sensors,\
    \ and weather conditions.\nIn [32], electromagnetic ﬁeld analysis is presented\
    \ as an enhanced monitoring approach for\nsubsurface radio wave propagation and\
    \ underground sensing applications in the ﬁeld of prediction\nagriculture. However,\
    \ this technology is challenging to implement in complex real environments,\n\
    which may delay system deployment. The prediction of the agriculture model presented\
    \ by [33]\noffers solution management capabilities by monitoring soil conditions\
    \ in real time using underground\nwireless sensors. Furthermore, the structure\
    \ used two types of communication links, above-ground\nand underground, for the\
    \ experiments. However, other challenges need to be solved, such as reducing\n\
    energy loss and promoting energy efﬁciency. These nodes should be able to adapt\
    \ to the soil moisture\nand temperature changes of the environment, among others.\n\
    More recently, the authors in [8] proposed an irrigation system that combines\
    \ IoT and data\nanalysis for the collection of environment data and control of\
    \ the farm via web and mobile applications.\nHowever, this article faced challenges\
    \ in controlling water in the farm. After analyzing state-of-the-art\nresearch\
    \ on water management and smart agriculture that applies IoT and related technology,\n\
    the following outcomes are drawn:\nJ. Sens. Actuator Netw. 2019, 8, 45\n5 of 22\n\
    •\nMany popular systems and platforms can be used for water management in smart\
    \ agriculture,\nbut may be too expensive for the average farmer [28–31].\n•\n\
    The combination of multiple technologies in one system and the presence of limitations\
    \ leads to\ncomplexity when combining proprietary technologies. Moreover, many\
    \ factors affect the price\n(e.g., farm, hardware design, and guiding documentation),\
    \ although a basic package costs a\nminimum of $500 in [28–31].\n•\nAll IoT smart\
    \ agriculture solutions on the market are Most IoT smart agriculture products\
    \ are\npassive methods (i.e., manual). In some cases, they are connected to farm\
    \ monitoring devices to\nact smartly.\n•\nMany researchers have presented solutions\
    \ for smart agriculture systems. However, these\nmethods are restricted by the\
    \ design-embedded board and the inﬂexibility of devices, as it\nmay be necessary\
    \ to attach additional sensors or to control two or more farms with the same\n\
    mobile application.\nTherefore, we proposal a novel system to address the four\
    \ above points:\n1.\nThe standard IoT water management system is explained and\
    \ designed. It can connect to the\nInternet through LoRa communication both manually\
    \ and automatically with all hardware\ndesigns. The IoT box is designed to manage\
    \ the IoT devices and obtain data from the farms.\n2.\nA system is possible connected\
    \ the agriculture from farming based on rural areas efﬁciency\nto IoT system.\
    \ Additionally, the implemented system is a good alternative for analyzing the\n\
    communication between the gateway and nodes 1 and 2.\n3.\nOur smart watering system\
    \ receives real-time data input from sensors embedded in a farm tunnel\nand other\
    \ locations. The system then offers suggestions for watering schedules and capacity.\n\
    An advantage provided by the sensors, used for two farms, are the transmission\
    \ of an evaluation\nto the user’s mobile application, from where users can prepare\
    \ a watering plan for the farms.\n4.\nFinally, our smart watering system is scheduled\
    \ to a date and time which guarantees that the\nwater level falls below the threshold\
    \ in the tunnel farm. The system notiﬁes the user and switches\non the water pump\
    \ (manual or automatic) in time to water the plants.\n3. System Architecture\n\
    The aim of this paper is to provide a solution for the real-time monitoring of\
    \ water management\nthat optimizes power consumption.\nAn additional target is\
    \ a cost-saving in smart agriculture.\nThe critical element that affects energy\
    \ dissipation in the sensor nodes is the transmitting module.\nAs a design operation,\
    \ it focuses on the structure of the sensor node and the meaning of the network\n\
    sensor architecture. Finally, the determination of effective data transfer technology\
    \ is geared towards\nimplementing an energy-efﬁcient sensor node. The details\
    \ are discussed in Section 3.1.\nHowever, most of the smart agriculture ﬁeld if\
    \ the data are the crucial importance in the node,\nwhere the users could be easily\
    \ chosen by operating more comfortable components. Therefore,\nthe micro-controller\
    \ must be selected to guarantee a suitable trade-off between energy efﬁciency\n\
    and complexity. Finally, elements must be selected to consider the optimal agreement\
    \ between\nmeasured data accuracy, expected energy to carry out that task, and\
    \ price, thus prioritizing the use of\nsensors. As a result, the power of the\
    \ sensors becomes an important factor for energy consumption\nand longevity. The\
    \ proposed IoT node in our system is constructed following these requirements.\n\
    First, the choice made regarding essential elements is a single-chip micro-controller\
    \ such as an\nATmega328/P or ATmega2560. A reasonable choice is to provide simple\
    \ open-source software to allow\nthe user to observe and boost their conﬁdence\
    \ in the programming. Second, it uses a lower number\nof clock cycles to execute\
    \ instructions than others—all of the sensors and the developed single-board\n\
    microcontroller, where all of the devices are integrated. Third, after reviewing\
    \ the start-of-the-art of\nthe relevant technology, the best option is the LoRa\
    \ technology, as it provides IoT connectivity over\nlarge areas by enabling data\
    \ transmission across an extended range. It uses very little power, is robust\n\
    in a rural area, and uses an overall network architecture that was developed in\
    \ a smart agriculture\nJ. Sens. Actuator Netw. 2019, 8, 45\n6 of 22\nsituation.\
    \ Finally, low-cost and low-power sensors were selected to provide an excellent\
    \ balance\nbetween measurement accuracy and energy efﬁciency.\nOur paper introduces\
    \ a reliable, robust, cost-effective, and scalable smart agriculture solution\n\
    based on IoT technology. The architecture system is presented in Figure 1, which\
    \ presents three\nnode prototypes: the gateway, node 1 and sensor node 1, and\
    \ node 2. The ﬂow diagram shown in\nFigure 2 demonstrates how to manage data transmission\
    \ between the gateway, node 1, and node 2 of\nour system.\n•\nThe gateway performs\
    \ the core functions of data collection from the nodes via LoRa, and then\nsends\
    \ data to the cloud, via the WiFi ESP82666 module, and to the mobile application.\
    \ Moreover,\nusers can also control the node throughout the gateway with the use\
    \ of the mobile app.\n•\nNode 1 and sensor node 1 are designed for this case,\
    \ as we assumed that the water pump machine\nis far from the sensor location.\n\
    •\nNode 2 was designed for orchard conditioners, with a topographic condition\
    \ suitable for installing\npumps directly in the farm without separating the sensor\
    \ block.\nFarm 1\nFarm 2\nGateWay\nNode 1\nSensor node 1\nNode 2\nFigure 1. Block\

    \ power system for the Gateway, Node 1 and 2 issue an AC supply of 220V. Nevertheless,\n\
    this power has to convert toward the expected form with normal voltage range for\
    \ storing power\nsupply to different kinds of devices in the IoT proposed node.\
    \ Based on the requirement of the\npower IoT system that the microcontroller and\
    \ the communication module need 5 V and 3.3 V for\nthe powering system with receive\
    \ node, respectively. It is necessary to include voltage regulators\ninside the\
    \ node. For that reason, two voltage regulators employ a 5 V regulator that powers\
    \ sensors of\nFigures 3–5 and a 3.3 V one which powers the powering system for\

    \ in the implementation presented in this paper, the communication of a\ngateway\
    \ is combined of a LoRa module and WiFi ESP8266 module, and ATmega2560. Figure\
    \ 3 shows\nthe Gateway node’s block diagram, which presents the details regarding\
    \ how all device elements are\nconnected: the LoRa transmission module, WiFi ESP8266\
    \ module, ATmega2560, and power system for\nGateway. Figures 6 and 7a show the\
    \ Electronic schematic and Gateway’s prototype, which includes\nthe sub-section\
    \ mentioned as below:\n3.2.1. Transmitter Module\nAs mentioned previously, the\
    \ transmitter module performs a vital concern in energy consumption\noptimization.\
    \ Hence, it has to be precisely selected and prospered. The IoT proposed node\
    \ is proposed\nto be used outside and spread over a rural area. Since radio communication\
    \ link solutions must be\nexplored, this needs to be taken into account. In fact,\
    \ it is unthinkable for something like this to have\na wirework connection (e.g.,\
    \ LAN) in large quantities at each node. An IoT application has many\ncommunication\
    \ networks where the sensor system is proposed. These systems are working based\
    \ on\nvarious radio technologies. Table 2 shows a measurement of the available\
    \ technologies, along with\ntheir essential features. The vital functions such\
    \ as area, consumption, and availability are accentuated\nin this table because\
    \ they are crucial parts for developing the device. After reviewing the technical\n\
    aspects as presented in this paper, the selection for data transmission technology\
    \ is an E32 LoRa series\nmodule [34]. The settings of this module work in the\

    \ 6. Electronic schematic of the Gateway and Node 1.\nConsidering all of these\
    \ previous technologies, there are mean ﬂexible options for the achievement\n\
    of IoT nodes. The most signiﬁcant selection has to be carefully studied as it\
    \ is easy to change\nthe hardware, implementation, and long-lasting quality over\
    \ time. The one recommended in our\narticle, which is a solution for the real-time\
    \ monitoring of controlling the level of water and resulting\nhypothesis, shows\
    \ as:\n•\nThe IoT node system is expected to be deployed for two nodes with the\
    \ distance between two\nnodes being a few km with complex terrain in rural areas.\
    \ Therefore, the cost of the system needs\nto reduce to the lowest level possible,\
    \ and the support services need to be optimized:\n•\nThe coverage of our system\
    \ to around tens of km2;\n•\nThe lower power consumption is composed possibly\
    \ for an adaptive data rate and changes\nthe output bit rate. Moreover, it depends\
    \ on payload combined with chirp spread spectrum\ntechnology that effectively\
    \ gives processing gain. In addition, LoRa Technology can easily plug\ninto existing\
    \ infrastructure and enables low-cost battery-operated IoT applications.\nAfter\
    \ reviewing these simple highlights, it can deﬁne the beneﬁts and drawbacks of\
    \ the leading\nfour communication networks released for the previously outlined:\n\
    J. Sens. Actuator Netw. 2019, 8, 45\n10 of 22\n(a) Gateway\n(b) Node 1\nFigure\
    \ 7. Prototype of the gateway and Node 1.\n•\nLocal Area Networks (LAN): The ad\
    \ hoc’s area coverage is signiﬁcantly more than other carrier\nnetwork technologies.\
    \ However, it still has some disadvantages. Applying the radio technology\nnetwork\
    \ for our system: for instance, WiFi or BLE technology set up, requires a signiﬁcant\
    \ number\nof nodes for the system. It will noticeably change the overall cost\
    \ of the deployed infrastructure.\nA different choice might be to implement a\
    \ ZigBee network or BLE technology. Because the system\nis not energy efﬁcient,\
    \ and admits a signiﬁcant decrease in the power consumption of the\nend device\
    \ nodes, this means that, although their current absorption levels are relatively\
    \ low\n(40 mA [35]), their life expectancy provided by batteries is in some order.\n\
    •\nLow Power Consumption (LPWAN): The authors in [36] proposed characterizing\
    \ great Area\nNetworks LPWAN solutions as their more extensive transmission range\
    \ allows for the\nestablishment of a star or multi-star network with some APs.\
    \ Allowing the sensor node to\nuse the chief duty-cycling policies allows for\
    \ turning off buttons for long periods. Finally, the\nprice of this technology\
    \ is meager when agreeing to use them in large quantities at no extra charge\n\
    as in the situation of ISP co-operation.\n•\nGlobal Area Networks (GAN): The global\
    \ network is the most simple solution to deploy because\nit does not need access\
    \ points or speciﬁc infrastructure implementations. Unfortunately, it has\nmany\
    \ other essential features, the ﬁrst being the price: 3G technologies; still,\
    \ the lowest of different\ntechniques is always more expensive than other solutions.\
    \ Furthermore, SIM is used, so\nthey need subscription payments when preparing\
    \ to deploy many of nodes and become\ninsigniﬁcant. Additionally, the energy consumption\
    \ needs to take into consideration that the\naverage modern consumption of the\
    \ third-generation mobile cellular system is many times higher\nthan that of the\
    \ IEEE 802.15.4 [37]. Alternatively, a low-power wide-area network module [38]\n\
    may be considered; however, obtaining it is unsuitable for applications with low\
    \ energy use.\nFinally, in the rural areas, some ISP cannot support the Internet\
    \ service for the users.\n•\nNarrowband-Internet of Things:\nNB-IoT is the novel\
    \ technology with a short form of\nNarrowband-Internet of Things and speciﬁed\
    \ in LTE Release-13 [39]. It is developed to meet\nthe requirements of LPWA (Low-Power\
    \ Wide-Area) networks. NB-IoT has a wide variety of\napplications for many ﬁelds\
    \ such as personal, technology and industrial. The applications are\nwearables,\
    \ smart bicycles, event detectors, smart garbage bins, smart metering, smart agriculture,\n\
    and logistics tracking. Mainly, low power and long-range are the absolute essentials\
    \ for IoT\n(Internet of Things), which is a signiﬁcant concern with mainstream\
    \ cellular technologies.\nThe other advantages of the NB-IoT are scalability,\
    \ quality of service and safety related to\nJ. Sens. Actuator Netw. 2019, 8, 45\n\
    11 of 22\nunlicensed LPWA networks and design, including the secure connections\

    UART\n3.2.2. ATmega2560 Microcontroller\nIn this research, the nodes communicate\
    \ with each other via the UART interface. At the gateway,\nit is necessary to\
    \ use two UARTs (the ﬁrst one communicates with the ESP8266 module, and the other\n\
    one is used to communicate with two nodes. In Node 1, it is also necessary for\
    \ two UART interfaces to\ncollect data from the nodes and the gateway, since the\
    \ ATmega2560 is a reasonable choice [40].\n3.2.3. WiFi ESP8266 Module\nThe WiFi\
    \ ESP8266 module from [41–43] is the best choice because the ESP8266 is very ﬂexible\
    \ in\ndata transfer between devices and mobile applications, easy to integrate\
    \ into advanced projects, and\nadaptable within the Arduino embedded development\
    \ environment.\n3.3. Node 1 and Sensor Node 1\nThe same as in gateway, in this\
    \ node, an AC supply has to be converted towards the demanded\nform with the required\
    \ voltage range for storing power supply to various types of devices. We are\n\
    suggesting that the micro-controller and the transmission module need 5 V for\
    \ the powering system\nwith a receive node each, and it is necessary to incorporate\
    \ voltage regulators inside the node. Therefore,\ntwo voltage regulators use 5\
    \ V and 3.3 V regulators, which power the sensors in Figure 4 and the\npowering\
    \ system for the receiver node.\nFigure 4 shows the block diagram of Node 1, which\
    \ designs the case. It assumes that the water\npump is placed far away from the\
    \ sensor location since there is a sensor node to collect the data for\nNode 1.\
    \ Node 1 receives the data from sensor Node 1. Based on the sensor values, we\
    \ can deﬁne the\nvalue from the application and the sensors located at Node 1.\
    \ Moreover, in this node, there are two\nprimary sensors, which are the pump temperature\
    \ sensor and water level sensor. LoRa module on\nNode 1 communicates to the Gateway.\
    \ We also use RF HC12, a short-range wireless data transmission\nmodule whose\
    \ primary function is to receive data from sensor Node 1 transmitted to Node 1.\
    \ RFID\nperforms the central feature of controlling the pump directly at Node\
    \ 1 to increase the security of the\nsystem, and LCD is designed to display the\
    \ data of Node 1. Sensor Node 1 in Figure 5 shows the\nﬂowchart of details as\
    \ the node power is an external AC–DC converter with 7 V that gives sufﬁcient\n\
    current to power all the components.\nSection 3.3.1 illustrates the details of\
    \ the ATmega328 microcontroller and the sensors connected in\nFigure 8 for Node\

    \ Node 2.\n3.3.1. ATmega328 Microcontroller\nAll of those sensors require the\
    \ involvement of a micro-controller system to perform:\nthis component must be\
    \ implemented to trade off the price, power consumption, and performance\nenergy\
    \ results. According to most elements of low power, modern micro-controllers use\
    \ for a several\nmA, the effects of this element for the typical power consumption\
    \ of the node can be negligible,\nthus providing a higher level of independence\
    \ [43].\nBased on the principle diagram of Gateway and Node 1, it seems that both\
    \ have many common\npoints, which can be seen in Figures 3 and 4. The best selection\
    \ in this study for the integrated design\nfor both Gateway and Node 1 is signiﬁcant.\
    \ Because they save on the costs of printed circuitry, achieve\nfaster circuit\
    \ machining, and quickly ﬁx hardware errors. Figure 6 shows the schematic of an\
    \ actuator\nGateway and Node 1, which contains: an AC–DC converter, ATmega2560,\
    \ LoRa transmission, RFID,\nLCD, and all the sensors. Note that, for the sake\
    \ of simplicity, we proposed all of the integrated circuits\ndepicted in the schematic.\
    \ After that, the printed circuit boards Gateway and Node 1 are designed\nwith\
    \ two layers of wires to make wiring more convenient and help optimize the circuit\
    \ as much as\npossible. The components are arranged in blocks with separate functions,\
    \ making it easier and more\nconvenient to check for errors.\nThe printed circuit\
    \ of Gateway and Node 1 is designed with:\n•\n62 components in which there are\
    \ 59 glued components and three pin components.\nJ. Sens. Actuator Netw. 2019,\
    \ 8, 45\n13 of 22\n•\nThe total number of different lines is 49 lines.\n•\nThere\
    \ are three different line sizes of 80 mils, 25, and 10 mils following different\
    \ wiring\nrequirements.\n•\nLine rules: do not cut wires, report faulty components\
    \ and the minimum distance between wires\nis 10 mm.\n•\nSize: 74.193 × 87.503\
    \ mm.\nFigure 7b shows the overall prototype of Node 1. Node 1 powers with a 5V\
    \ AC–DC converter that\nstores full current energy to control all the components\
    \ and the relay module. Furthermore, the LoRa\nmodule is not put close to the\
    \ converter because it generated the electrical noise and the interference of\n\
    communication links.\nWith the various parameters to be observed in our system,\
    \ in most cases, temperature,\ntemperature–humidity, soil moisture, rain, and\
    \ water level are measured.\n•\nTemperature sensor: DS18B20, [44], the popular\
    \ solution for temperature control in smart\nagriculture systems is the application\
    \ of standard digital sensors, for instance, DS18B20 integrated\ncircuits in this\
    \ research.\n•\nTemperature-humidity sensor: DHT22 [45] is a current sensor, which\
    \ combines the temperature\nand humidity sensor; it provides a wider temperature\
    \ range and better accuracy. In particular,\nit has low consumption and is better\
    \ for most smart farming systems.\n•\nSoil moisture sensor: SKU:SEN0193 [46],\
    \ this soil moisture sensor measures soil moisture levels\nby capacitive sensing\
    \ rather than resistive sensing like other sensors on the market. It is made of\n\
    corrosion-resistant material, which provides a good solution for the user. Moreover,\
    \ the sensor is\nsimple to use—an analog sensor that works at a low voltage.\n\
    •\nRain sensor: LM393, this is an analog sensor that operates at a low voltage,\
    \ and the current sensor\nis for easily detecting rain [47].\n•\nWater level and\
    \ temperature pump: LM393 [48]; this is an analog sensor when the water level\n\
    reaches below the threshold in the tunnel farm and checks the sensors. Our system\
    \ communicates\nto the user and establishes a water pump to its switch on the\
    \ state for sufﬁcient watering of plants\nthroughout a mobile application.\nFigure\
    \ 9 shows the sensor Node 1 electronic schematic, and how total hardware elements\
    \ are\nattached: microcontroller, power, and IC circuit. DS 1307 is used to read\
    \ the real-time with the high\naccuracy, LoRa module transfer data via a serial\
    \ connection, and the module connection is used to\nconnect RF HC12, RFID RC522,\
    \ LCD, sensors, pump, and ATmega2560. Figure 10a shows an actual\nmodel of sensor\
    \ Node 1.\nBesides the hardware, before being discussed, sensor Node 1 needs an\
    \ additional device to\noperate. The general important thing is the power subsystem.\
    \ In the case of the nodes, it was selected\nto power the nodes. Note that, in\
    \ this situation, we also can be used by the power supply unit, which\nis based\
    \ on a 12 W solar panel. The solar panel is linked to the solar charge controller,\
    \ where a solar\ncharge controller manages the power going into the battery.\n\

    \ Tests\nThe proposed smart agriculture system is evaluated using two different\
    \ scenarios in Vietnam:\ndemonstrating the effectiveness of the sensors for the\
    \ analysis of temperature, solid humidity in\na research lab; and conﬁrming data\
    \ transmission by using the LoRa channel over a large area\nand distance.\n4.1.\
    \ Tests on the Sensors of the IoT\nThe ﬁrst scenario was set up in the Department\
    \ of Electronics and Telecommunications\nEngineering of Ton Duc Thang University,\
    \ Vietnam, where the sensing infrastructure was evaluated.\nThe performance of\
    \ the system was tested using a subset of nodes with the Arduino. These sensors\n\
    were used because the presence of other components would not affect the accuracy\
    \ of the measurement.\nIn addition, since the circuit board was furnished with\
    \ the equivalent microcontroller used in the node,\nthis circuit board was chosen\
    \ for speciﬁc tests due to its ease of use, as fast prototyping is required\n\
    and because it can exploit the equivalent microprogramming of an IoT button. Experiments\
    \ were\nperformed using the gate, button 1, and sensor button 1 and button 2 with\
    \ LoRa integrated with\nembedded sensors. An easy-to-read LCD screen was added\
    \ to the mainboard, where it displayed\nthe temperature and humidity measured\
    \ by the sensor as shown in Figures 11 and 12. Furthermore,\nthe accuracy of sensor\
    \ measurements was displayed and conﬁrmed on the LCD screen. Finally,\nsensors\
    \ were calibrated before the test to guarantee the accuracy of data, and to help\
    \ users to eliminate\ndifﬁculties during the setup process the system.\nJ. Sens.\

    sensors on the right.\n4.2. Test on Data Transmission through the LoRa Channel\n\
    In the second scenario, the effectiveness of the LoRa technology for the placement\
    \ of a farm\nmonitoring infrastructure was investigated by examining data transmission\
    \ distances in two real\nfarms as shown in Figure 13. For this purpose, a model\
    \ system infrastructure was set up in the Cho\nLach district, Ben Tre province,\
    \ Vietnam, to demonstrate the usability of an individual star topology\nnetwork\
    \ covering an entirely rural area. The model infrastructure was composed using\
    \ a gateway node\nproduced by a LoRa E32-TTL-1W module connected to a mobile application,\
    \ and by two sensor nodes.\nThe transmission modules were set up with three critical\
    \ measures: the symbol rate of information,\nthe bandwidth of the channel, and\
    \ the information rate were set according to the datasheet provided\nby the manufacturer\
    \ in order to obtain the highest sensitivity.\nBased on the sensor network structure\
    \ presented in the previous sections, the transmission\nranges were checked by\
    \ placing the gateway in the farm. The nodes were located in various areas:\n\
    node 1 covered 2000 m2 at a distance of 700 m from the gateway, while node 2 covered\
    \ 1000 m2 at a\ndistance of 500 m from the gateway. These positions were ﬁxed\
    \ and it was veriﬁed that the actual\ndata was correctly received. Subsequently,\
    \ data were collected from nodes 1 and 2 and sent to the\ngateway during the following\
    \ seven days of the same month, during which 24-h measurements were\nmade. In\
    \ this way, the performance of the system was tested. Figures 14 and 15 show the\
    \ results\nof the two nodes, which present the soil moisture, humidity, and temperature.\
    \ It can be observed\nthat, based on the threshold of these values, the system\
    \ could automatically switch on the water for\nthe farm. The experimental results\
    \ indicate that the application of a quick procedure for effective\nJ. Sens. Actuator\
    \ Netw. 2019, 8, 45\n17 of 22\nresolution building certainly helps to enhance\
    \ the outcomes of a sensor-based system. Not only does a\nsmart strategy improve\
    \ the performance of IoT-based and sensor-based systems, but the efﬁciency of\n\
    these systems can be increased with the smarter and more accurate choices made\
    \ by such intelligent\nsystems. Our experimental results highlight the procedure\
    \ used by the smart irrigation system to\nsave water in tunnel farming, thus achieving\
    \ higher productivity and the ability to ﬂexibly manage\nthe farm.\nFigure 13.\
    \ Map of the area covered by the LoRa module.\nFigure 14. Collected soil moisture,\
    \ humidity, and temperature during the data acquisition campaign\ncarried out\
    \ on Node 1 of Cho Lach district, Ben Tre province, Vietnam.\nData transmission\
    \ is also a crucial issue in the IoT smart system in checking the effect of packet\
    \ loss.\nData transmission is tested by exploiting a model created by internal\
    \ sensors. Node 1, Node 2, and the\ngateway are connected through a LoRa module\
    \ in the prototype as described in Section 4.1. Packages\nare lost from all test\
    \ nodes during transmission. Although packet loss was observed whenever the\n\
    model moved between a test place, this is not a problem because the nodes are\
    \ expected to remain\nat the growing farms in the studied area. Therefore, LoRa\
    \ technology is proven to be effective when\ndeployed in rural areas, without\
    \ having to turn on acceleration mode on the transfer module shown\nin Figure\
    \ 13.\nJ. Sens. Actuator Netw. 2019, 8, 45\n18 of 22\nFigure 15. Collected soil\
    \ moisture, humidity, and temperature during the data acquisition campaign\ncarried\
    \ out on Node 2 of Cho Lach district, Ben Tre province, Vietnam.\n5. Discussion\n\
    The smart agriculture system based on an IoT application has the following advantages\
    \ compared\nto the previous approaches:\n•\nThe system can be used to manage two\
    \ or more independent farms on the same mobile application,\nwhich may have different\
    \ growth schedules. The aim of this research was to use devices of the\nIoT system\
    \ with lower prices that are easy to obtain.\n•\nRemoving the need for WiFi on\
    \ the farm with the application of LoRa technology helps to save\nenergy, lower\
    \ costs, improve efﬁciency, and facilitate excellent communication between the\
    \ farm\nand gateway.\n•\nControl data are saved to the system memory to prevent\
    \ power outages that result in data loss.\nFurthermore, the multitude of control\
    \ modes makes it easier for users to manipulate the farm.\n•\nReal-time updates\
    \ are available directly from the Internet in order to enable the system to run\n\
    more accurately.\n•\nA lost WiFi connection can be detected and communicated to\
    \ users for timely processing.\n•\nMany different sensors are integrated to collect\
    \ information related to tree care in order to improve\ncrop productivity. Our\
    \ strategy studies ﬁve parameters: temperature, temperature–humidity,\nsoil moisture,\
    \ rain, and water level.\n•\nNone of the previously mentioned approaches discuss\
    \ and investigate the effect of energy\nconsumption in smart irrigation systems.\
    \ Furthermore, other methods frequently rely on soil\nmoisture to determine the\

    \ smart watering system approach the standard\nwatering procedure as a product\
    \ of high-tech application. It has an economic efﬁciency that is at\nleast 30%\
    \ higher than the used technology.\nIn addition to the advantages presented above,\
    \ our research also has disadvantages, which need\nto be overcome before widespread\
    \ application. For instance, the ESP8266 module is a mid-range\nmodule without\
    \ a high stability, while the system can lose an Internet connection and depends\
    \ on the\nBlynk application.\n6. Conclusions\nThis paper presents a solution using\
    \ LoRa module transmission for a low-cost and effective smart\nagriculture system\
    \ for use in Vietnam, which is designed and implemented to control environmental\n\
    J. Sens. Actuator Netw. 2019, 8, 45\n19 of 22\nfactors in agriculture. It is less\
    \ expensive than other solutions with a similar accuracy. The system can\ncontinuously\
    \ observe the measured values and communicate them to users via a network and\
    \ mobile\napplication. Furthermore, the system can send alarms to users and activate\
    \ reduction devices. The IoT\nnode was tested in two separate cases in Cho Lach\
    \ district, Ben Tre province, Vietnam, and was used\nto measure distinct values\
    \ such as moisture, humidity, and temperature. Finally, experiments were\nperformed\
    \ to determine if the embedded electronics and the wireless communication module\
    \ might\ninﬂuence the collected values; there were no signs of interference. In\
    \ summary, the results conﬁrm\nthat the system provides the optimal solution to\
    \ users of smart agricultural control for farmers in\nVietnam. The availability\
    \ of real-time data enables quick use and management at all times from all\nplaces.\
    \ However, when IoT nodes are placed in various places, they generate huge quantities\
    \ of data.\nIn this case, our system requires time to store and analyze data before\
    \ ﬁnding the best solution.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, T.-Y.N.,\

    The growing demand of food resources, the rise of energy prices, and the climate
    changes have been recognized among the main causes of the food crisis that is
    recently affecting the whole planet [1]. In the framework of industrial agriculture,
    the dramatic increase of food prices brings back to mind the problem of the intensive
    exploitation of the natural resources. In order to define a suitable model of
    sustainable agriculture aimed at preserving the environment and the communities
    of the farmers as well as at enhancing the productivity, a modern approach consists
    into the exploitation of technologies and techniques for achieving, in production,
    economies of scale. Recently, an innovative strategy generally identified as “precision
    agriculture” has been proposed to cope with the problem of environmental sustainability
    [2] [3]. It is based on the observation, the impact assessment, and a timely strategic
    response to fine-scale variation of the parameters of agricultural production
    processes [4] in order to reduce the waste of natural resources and the use of
    fertilizing substances also holding or enhancing the yield of the tillage at the
    same time. In this area, a significant role is played by the Global Positioning
    System (GPS) [5] thanks to its features in terms of localization. Moreover, remote
    sensing techniques [6] have been employed to provide suitable and effective information
    to the farmers in order to evaluate soil and environmental conditions starting
    from images collected by satellites or by the plane. However, the need of real-time
    data and the arising cost strongly suggest the use/integration of/with alternative
    strategies based on sensors located inside or nearby the tillage. In this scenario
    Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) [7] can play a relevant role. More specifically,
    a WSN is a wireless network composed by a set of autonomous, low-power, and low-cost
    devices (called nodes) using sensors to cooperatively monitor physical quantities.
    WSN are a key technology for the monitoring both in military and civil frameworks.
    Such devices are employed in domotics and security applications, for instance
    to track people [8]. Thanks to the possibility to acquire the monitored parameters
    in a continuous and distributed fashion, the WSN are also employed in environmental
    applications, such as precision farming and forest-area monitoring [9]. In these
    frameworks, the low cost and the wireless architecture (fast deployment and high
    scalability) play a relevant role for the rapid diffusion of WSN. In the particular
    context of precision farming, the issues related to the energetic consumption
    and to the propagation of electromagnetic waves in a complex environment significantly
    impact on the physical layer, with nonnegligible setbacks at superior layers as
    well. WSNs have been already used for precision farm purposes especially for monitoring
    environmental parameters [10]. Such a paper describes an innovative solution based
    on a WSN for precision agriculture. With respect to state-of-the-art deployments,
    the proposed solution is based on totally autonomous sensor nodes characterized
    by multiple sensors to real-time collect in a distribute fashion data concerned
    with the temperature and the moisture of the subsoil, but also related to the
    tree, with the aim of defining a closed-loop control system for agriculture management.
    In this framework, the system is aimed at providing a substantial amount of information
    in order to assess the relationship between the irrigation and the quality of
    the tillage yield. SECTION 2. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE The proposed system is composed
    by 27 WSN nodes, each one equipped with 5 Decagon EC-5 [11] soil moisture sensors,
    a subsoil thermometer based on the Sensirion SHT75 sensor [12], and an Ecomatik
    DD dendrometer [13] in order to monitor the variation of the diameter of the trunk.
    Such sensors are connected through an input/output interface to a TinyNode 584
    WSN platform [14]. As detailed in Figure 1, the power supply subsystem consists
    of a lead acid battery (6 V 4.5 A/h), a solar panel able to provide 250 mA at
    7 V and a 3V DC/DC converter based on a dual frequency high efficient switching
    regulator. Fig. 1. Sensor node architecture. Show All For a more efficient power
    management and to provide a 2.5V regulated power supply to the sensors, a second
    DC/DC converter is used. This voltage regulator is turned on by a CMOS switch
    only when the acquisition procedure is started. Finally, in order to acquire the
    8 analog input channels an additional analog low resistance multiplexer controlled
    by the WSN node is employed. According to the on-board software routines, the
    acquisition procedure is started every 10 min (sampling time). During this time,
    the sensor node is in low power operation mode (called also “sleep mode”) and
    every unnecessary module (such as RF module and sensor) is switched off. The sampling
    time can be reduced by the user or can be changed automatically when a fast humidity
    variation is measured by the soil moisture sensors in order to monitor the current
    phenomena. In this way the power consumption is kept extremely low (about 80μA
    @ 6V). Moreover, the lead acid battery are recharged by means of a solar panel.
    When the “sleep mode” timer expire, the acquisition routine is started (as show
    in Fig. 2) and the 2.5V voltage regulator is switched on. After some warm-up time
    (5 ms), all the sensors are interrogated sequentially. During this procedure,
    the power consumption is about 120mA @ 6V. In order to perform a real-time monitoring
    of the state of the network, each node also collects data concerned with the voltage
    of the battery, the current provided by the solar panel, the internal voltage,
    as well as the temperature of the microcontroller. In addition to the voltage
    of the output signals of the sensors, the voltage of the soil moisture sensors
    and dendrometer power supply is gathered in order to real-time compensate the
    measured data. At the end of the measurement procedure, the sensor board is switched
    off and the RF interface sends the collected data over radio channel to a sink
    node. Finally, the sensor node return to the “sleep mode”. Fig. 2. On-board SW
    flow chart. Show All The network can be organized in star or multihop topology
    depending on the dimension of the required coverage area. In our implementation,
    we are using nodes working in the 868Mhz Industrial, Scientific and Medical (ISM)
    band with maximum output power of 12 dBm. Moreover, a robust and simple star topology
    has been considered in order to improve the reliability of the measurement system
    and reduce the power consumption with respect to the multihop network topology.
    The sink node receives the data coming from sensor nodes, measure the Received
    Signal Strength (RSS) value of every packet and sends the data packet to a Gateway
    (GW). Such a GW assign date and time to the packet and sends the raw data to a
    database for real time and historic data management. The data are finally converted
    and calibrated by specific equations and displayed on a web site. SECTION 3. DEPLOYMENT
    The sensor node is installed in a plastic package to protect the devices against
    adversary weather conditions and, at the same time, avoid perturbation on the
    antenna pattern. The solar panel is mounted on the top of the plastic case. To
    maximize the recharge efficiency, a specific mounting bracket with a tilt of 45°
    has been employed (see Fig. 3). Fig. 3. Sensor node deployment. Show All The sensor
    nodes have been deployed on a 5000 m2 large apple orchard and disposed in 3 different
    areas where different irrigation thesis are carried out. In each area, the WSN
    nodes have been equally-spaced on a grid of size 30 m×40 m. As reported in the
    Figure 4, the soil moisture sensors have been located underground at different
    depth levels (−0.1 m, −0.2 m, −0.3 m, −0.5 m and −0.8 m). Moreover, the thermometer
    has been located at −0.2 m in depth and the dendrometers has been applied to seven
    apple trees chosen among those. Data are continuously collected by the sensor
    nodes and are then transmitted to a gateway node located in the farm 300 m far
    from the orchard. Then, data gathered by the sensor nodes and from a permanent
    weather station are then organized in a database on a public web site (http://www.eledia.ing.unitn.it).
    More in detail, data can be downloaded in raw format, their behavior with respect
    to time can be visualized, or the parameters can be presented linked to the location
    as in a geographic information system (GIS) (see Fig. 5). Fig. 4. Sensors positioning.
    Show All Fig. 5. GIS-like visualization of collected data. Show All SECTION 4.
    CONCLUSION This paper describes a WSN-based system for precision agriculture.
    Such an installation is characterized by totally autonomous nodes equipped with
    a set of multiple sensors to collect data concerned with environmental parameters
    as well as with the status of the apple trees. The preliminary validation of the
    network confirmed the effectiveness of such a system and the feasibility of the
    precision farming by means of WSN. The long run use of the system will certainly
    provide useful data and suggestions to complete a closed-loop solution for production
    management. The natural evolution of the proposed system is the integration on
    the network of some actuator nodes that are able to control the irrigation system
    following an irrigation strategy based on the measured parameters. Authors Figures

  explanation: 'The paper mainly focuses on integrating low-cost flying IoT devices
    with existing irrigation infrastructure to achieve automated and real-time monitoring
    of environmental parameters in an agricultural environment. The aim is to apply
    smart actions for precision agriculture, leading to improved crop productivity
    and resource conservation.


    The paper begins by highlighting the importance of environmental monitoring and
    how traditional methods have limitations in terms of accuracy, timeliness, and
    cost-effectiveness. It then introduces the use of IoT sensors and drones as a
    solution to these limitations.


    The authors propose a low-cost platform that integrates IoT sensors with a drone
    for comprehensive environmental parameter monitoring. The platform consists of:


    1. IoT sensors deployed in the field to collect data on temperature, humidity,
    soil moisture, rain level, and solar radiation.

    2. A drone equipped with a LoRa module to collect data from the IoT sensors and
    transmit it to the cloud.

    3. A cloud-based platform for data storage, analysis, and visualization.


    The proposed platform offers several advantages over traditional monitoring methods,
    including:


    1. Automated and real-time data collection, reducing the need for manual labor
    and improving accuracy.

    2. Wider coverage area due to the use of a drone, allowing for monitoring of large
    agricultural fields.

    3. Cost-effectiveness, as the platform leverages low-cost IoT sensors and open-source
    software.


    The paper also provides experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness
    of the proposed platform. The results show that the platform can accurately monitor
    environmental parameters and provide valuable insights for farmers to make informed
    decisions. For example, farmers can use the data to:


    1. Optimize irrigation schedules based on soil moisture levels.

    2. Adjust fertilizer application based on soil nutrient levels.

    3. Monitor crop health and identify potential diseases or pests.


    Overall, the paper presents a promising approach for integrating IoT and drones
    for precision agriculture. The proposed platform has the potential to significantly
    improve crop productivity and resource conservation while reducing labor costs.'

    \ (IoT) with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)\noccurred, tens of applications including\
    \ smart agriculture have emerged to offer innovative solutions\nto modernize the\
    \ farming sector. This paper aims to present a low-cost platform for comprehensive\n\
    environmental parameter monitoring using ﬂying IoT. This platform is deployed\
    \ and tested in a real\nscenario on a farm in Medenine, Tunisia, in the period\
    \ of March 2020 to March 2021. The experi-\nmental work fulﬁlls the requirements\
    \ of automated and real-time monitoring of the environmental\nparameters using\
    \ both under- and aboveground sensors. These IoT sensors are on a farm collecting\n\
    vast amounts of environmental data, where it is sent to ground gateways every\
    \ 1 h, after which the\nobtained data is collected and transmitted by a drone\
    \ to the cloud for storage and analysis every 12 h.\nThis low-cost platform can\
    \ help farmers, governmental, or manufacturers to predict environmental\ndata\
    \ over the geographically large farm ﬁeld, which leads to enhancement in crop\
    \ productivity and\nfarm management in a cost-effective, and timely manner. Obtained\
    \ experimental results infer that\nautomated and human-made sets of actions can\
    \ be applied and/or suggested, due to the innovative\nintegration between IoT\
    \ sensors with the drone. These smart actions help in precision agriculture,\n\
    which, in turn, intensely boost crop productivity, saving natural resources.\n\

    \ (FAO) predicts that by 2050, the world popu-\nlation will hit 9.73 billion,\
    \ and by 2100, it will be 11.2 billion; with the current population of\napproximately\
    \ 7.84 billion, this shows an increase of approximately 25% [1]. To feed this\n\
    larger population, food production should double by 2050 [2]. For example, the\
    \ current\nﬁgure of 2.1 billion tons of annual cereal production should reach\
    \ approximately 3 billion\ntons [3]. This means there is a serious need to enhance\
    \ productivity and meet the demands\nof nations [4]. However, the current agricultural\
    \ land is restricted by various factors such as\nland and climate patterns, population\
    \ density, and rapid urbanization, which are constantly\nposing threats to the\
    \ availability of arable land [5]. To illustrate, in 1991, the total arable\n\
    area for food production was 19.5 million square miles (39.47% of the world’s\
    \ land area),\nwhich was reduced to approximately 18.6 million square miles (37.73%\
    \ of the world’s land\narea) in 2013 [6]. Thus, the gap between the demand and\
    \ supply of food is becoming\nmore signiﬁcant and alarming as time progresses.\
    \ Therefore, authors in the literature [7,8]\nemphasize the signiﬁcance of enhancing\
    \ farm management by using scientiﬁc strategies\nSustainability 2021, 13, 5908.\

    \ which, in turn, drastically boost crop productivity\nand help in saving natural\
    \ resources [9,10].\nIn recent years of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR),\
    \ researchers, engineers, and\nIT specialists are striving to participate in employing\
    \ advanced technology to achieve\na better life for our planet, as Figure 1 shows\
    \ [11,12]. One of those pillars of 4IR is IoT,\nwhich is considered as the fuel\
    \ of the 4IR since it contributes effectively by linking trillions\nof objects\
    \ and sensors, all of which generate real-time data. It is expected that around\n\
    100 billion devices have been connected to the internet by 2020 [13,14]. This\
    \ number will\nfurther increase since the IoT is progressively entering a wide\
    \ array of sectors and indus-\ntries, ranging from manufacturing, health, communications,\
    \ and energy to the agricultural\nindustry [15]. In an agricultural environment,\
    \ for instance, IoT technology has been uti-\nlized to deal with distributed data\
    \ collection from farming environments and, important\nfor directing farmers,\
    \ with real-time information of the farming ﬁeld [16]. On the other\nhand, integration\
    \ between IoT and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) attracts researchers’\nattention\

    \ (LoS)\nconnectivity, efﬁciency, applicability, rapid deployment, and low maintenance\
    \ cost are valid\nreasons for considering such a technology. UAVs cover a wide\
    \ range of platforms, from\ndrones to high altitude platforms (HAPs), low altitude\
    \ platforms (LAPs), or tethered plat-\nforms [17,18]. UAVs have drawn tremendous\
    \ attention, both in the industry and academia,\ndue to their advantages and wide\
    \ applications [19]. For example, telecommunications,\nmonitor disaster-relief\
    \ missions, empowering smart cities, atmospheric studies, service\ndelivery, surveillance,\

    \ requirements of such integration are covered in\nthis section. A related work\
    \ windup is presented in Table 1, before using this review to\nhighlight the research\
    \ gaps and report own research motivations.\nGeorgios et al. [26] proposed a low-cost\
    \ Long-Range Wide-Area Network (LoRa)-based\nIoT platform for Smart Farming Modular\
    \ IoT Architecture called LoRaFarM that aims to im-\nprove generic farms management\
    \ in a highly customizable way. The proposed LoRaFarM\nplatform has been evaluated\
    \ in a real farm in Italy, where it collected environmental data\n(air, soil,\
    \ temperature, and humidity) related to the growth of farm products (e.g., grapes\n\
    and greenhouse vegetables) over a period of three months. A web-based visualization\
    \ tool\nfor the collected data is also presented, to validate the LoRaFarM architecture.\n\
    Authors in [27] developed a hierarchical smart farming structure based on the\
    \ collabo-\nration between UAVs and federated Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs)\
    \ for crop monitoring.\nTwo important aspects of such collaboration have been\
    \ considered: designing the UAV tra-\njectories for efﬁcient data collection and\
    \ implementing effective data processing algorithms\n(consensus and symbolic aggregate\
    \ approximation) at the network level to assess relevant\ndata transmission. Experiments\
    \ were carried out at a Romanian research institute where\nSustainability 2021,\
    \ 13, 5908\n4 of 26\ndifferent crops and methods are developed. The results demonstrate\
    \ that the collaborative\nUAV–WSN–IoT approach increases the performances in both\
    \ smart farming and ecological\nagriculture.\nA smart agriculture management system\
    \ (SAMS) was introduced in [28], which\nproposed an automated system to help farmers\
    \ to increase crop production by crashing\ninto natural resources. The system\
    \ used different sensors to collect data required for the\ngrowth of the crop,\
    \ where these data were fed into the ThingSpeak IoT cloud platform for\ndata visualization.\
    \ The real-time data were stored on Firebase Database and then used for\ncrop\
    \ prediction using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classiﬁer.\nResearchers in [29]\
    \ presented an intelligent antifrost irrigation management system\nthat contains\
    \ a climatological station and ecological anti-disaster frost irrigation. The\n\
    solar-powered system interacts with the environmental system through a website,\
    \ allowing\nthe real-time interconnection, acquisition, and monitoring of information\
    \ through mobile\nphone systems (GSM/GPRS) and internet (TCP/IP) services. Additionally,\
    \ the proposed\nsystem uses an intelligent Fuzzy Expert System (FES) to predict\
    \ the greenhouse temperature\nand control activation of a water pump, considering\
    \ humidity, the temperature of inside\nand outside air, solar radiation, and wind\
    \ speed. The intelligent model gives a prediction\nby determining coefﬁcients\
    \ with the analysis of variance method.\nNestor et al. in [30] developed an application\
    \ for water irrigation called “Agrinex.”\nThis system is an alternative approach\
    \ in collecting and measuring physical parameters\nfrom the environment, particularly\
    \ in smart irrigation systems. Agrinex is connected to\nseveral in-ﬁeld sensors\
    \ such as a water level sensor, paddy temperature sensor, and a\nﬁeld weather\
    \ station. This work aimed to make this information accessible anywhere\nwherever\
    \ there is internet access using a mobile application, which makes Agrinex scalable\n\
    and adaptable to changes. The mesh-based network recorded a maximum transmission\n\
    distance of 11 m from sink to sensor node with a 90% success rate. Data from the\
    \ ﬁeld can\nbe accessed remotely close to real-time when short network delays\
    \ are accounted for. It\nalso gives the additional beneﬁt of equipping lands with\
    \ an automated irrigation system\nthat conserves up to 81% of water consumption.\n\
    Authors in [31] proposed a system that decides whether or not water is needed\n\
    for farms by predicting the rainfall using the Genetic Algorithm (GA) approach.\
    \ In the\nproposed system, voluminous weather and soil moisture data are stored\
    \ inside the cloud\nservers. Based on data collected by a UAV and then fed to\
    \ the GA, water spraying is\nperformed, which can be monitored using a mobile\
    \ application. Cloud servers are used for\nstoring and processing large volumes\
    \ of weather and soil moisture data. Results show that\nthe sensor-based system\
    \ is activated to check whether the GA-based system completes its\nprediction\
    \ correctly or not by sensing moisture levels from the soil. If the moisture level\n\
    of the soil crosses the predeﬁned threshold value, then plant watering is performed\
    \ by\nquadrotor UAV.\nResearchers in [32] developed a framework for monitoring\
    \ pests and diseases of crops\nbased on IoT and UAV that attempts to solve the\
    \ correlation between the occurrence of\npests/diseases and weather parameters.\
    \ The proposed framework is deployed in the\nYangtze River Zone of China, where\
    \ it uses rotary devices based on sun perception to\nobtain solar energy. Results\
    \ infer that low-altitude remote sensing and monitoring through\naerial imaging\
    \ of pests and diseases using UAV is reasonable, while more analyses of\nclimate\
    \ changes would provide some precautions in advance.\nA Narrow Band IoT (NB-IoT)\
    \ system is proposed in [33] to collect underground soil\nparameters in potato\
    \ crops using a UAV network. Around 2500 sensors deployed under\nand above ground\
    \ are connected to UAV using Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Network\n(LPWPAN).\
    \ Simulation results show that due to UAV altitude and path loss, the link quality\n\
    between the ground sensor and UAV is reduced. Another observation is that the\
    \ lifetime\nof sensor batteries was varied depending on the location of the sensor\
    \ under or above\nground. Using LoRa technology and proper path loss model are\
    \ recommended as future\nwork to enhance link accuracy and performance. Regarding\
    \ path loss, authors in [22–25]\nSustainability 2021, 13, 5908\n5 of 26\ndiscussed\
    \ different types of propagation path loss from an aerial platform perspective,\n\
    where Free-Space and Air-to-Ground are typical deterministic propagation models,\
    \ while\nHata and Okumura are typical empirical ones. Results show that an appropriate\
    \ model can\nbe selected based on coverage range, adaption across different terrains,\
    \ and better Quality\nof Service (QoS).\nAuthors in [34] suggested a heterogeneous\
    \ IoT sensor node system to sense acoustic,\nrain, wind, light, temperature, and\
    \ pH levels of the cornﬁelds for smart agriculture applica-\ntions. The system\
    \ aimed to achieve productive corn harvest in large-scale ﬁelds using a\ndrone\
    \ that gathers data and sends it to a gateway. The simulation results that monitored\n\
    at the gateway using the IoT application called Grafana show that it offers maximum\n\
    efﬁciency from the soil and follows the crop development according to the weather\
    \ and soil\nconditions, in addition to reducing the workload and the risk of disease\
    \ and pest, as well\nas optimizing irrigation and obtaining better quality products\
    \ at low cost. As future work,\ncollecting a wider range of climatic data and\
    \ geographical conditions would be useful in\ndesigning a model of smart farming.\n\

    \ 2021, 13, 5908\n7 of 26\nThis paper is motivated to present a low-cost platform\
    \ for comprehensive environ-\nmental parameter monitoring using ﬂying IoT. This\
    \ integration between IoT and drone\nis also coupled with cloud computing technology,\
    \ which, in turn, helps in building sus-\ntainable smart agriculture and enhancing\
    \ crop productivity and farm management in a\ncost-effective, and timely manner.\n\
    Thus, the paper aims to implement a system that periodically collects data using\n\
    both under- and aboveground sensors on farms and sends them to the gateway; then,\n\
    using a drone with a LoRa module onboard, the obtained data are transmitted to\
    \ the cloud\nfor storage, analysis, and monitor the status of crops and farms.\
    \ The proposed platform\nis based on experimental work to fulﬁll the requirements\
    \ of automated and real-time\nmonitoring of the environmental parameters for 12\
    \ months. Thus, a clear picture can be\nobtained to make wise decisions in managing\
    \ the crop and enhancing its productivity.\nThis integrated system of multiple\
    \ technologies used in the proposed platform develops\ncomprehensive under- and\
    \ aboveground sensors, along with considering an optimized\npropagation path loss,\
    \ which is a noteworthy shift from existing works. In this context and\nto achieve\
    \ the paper’s aim, the following research objectives need to be pursued:\nO1.\n\
    Identiﬁcation of environmental parameters affecting crop productivity;\nO2.\n\
    Selection of a propagation model that is suitable for smart farming;\nO3.\nHardware\
    \ calibration of related devices for experimental work;\nO4.\nImplementation of\
    \ the proposed platform and testing ti in a real scenario;\nO5.\nAnalyzing ﬁndings\
    \ and drawing smart action plans to help in precision agriculture.\n3. Materials\
    \ and Methods\nThis section presents the architecture of the platform, which aims\
    \ to monitor using\nboth under- and aboveground sensors and a drone for smart\
    \ farming. Figure 3 shows\nthe conceptual work in a bird’s-eye view of the proposed\
    \ architecture, which consists of\nspace segment and ground segment. The space\
    \ segment comprises the drone, with its\npayloads including the camera, and LoRa\
    \ module, which is responsible for collecting data\nfrom a wireless server gateway\
    \ and then transmitting them to the cloud for storage and\nfurther analysis. The\
    \ ground segment contains three parts: (1) ground control station that\nis controlled\
    \ by the end user; (2) underground sensors gateway node that collects data\nfrom\
    \ underground sensors (soil moisture); and (3) HOBO U30 Weather Station Starter\n\
    Kit, which is an aboveground sensor that measures temperature/humidity, rain,\
    \ and solar\nradiation. Clearly, in the proposed platform architecture, the drone\
    \ acts as a focal point\nbetween ground devices including sensors, relays, and\
    \ gateways, on the one hand, and\ncloud, on the other hand, which reﬂects the\
    \ reliability and robustness of such a technology.\nThe rest of this section discusses\
    \ the proposed architecture from functions and speci-\nﬁcations in ﬁve layers,\
    \ namely, sensor nodes layer, wireless server gateway, drone-LoRa\nlayer, cloud\

    \ as presented in related works of the\nprevious section.\nHata’s equations are\

    \ Implementation and Testbed\nThis section presents the proposed solution as deployed\

    \ practical\nresults indicate that automated and human-made sets of actions have\
    \ been applied and/or\nsuggested that are smart actions for precision agriculture,\
    \ which, in turn, dramatically\nboost crop productivity and help in saving natural\
    \ resources. Examples of these actions are\nthe following:\n•\nFarmers are advised\
    \ to consider various strategies such as spraying chemicals on\nplants during\
    \ some seasons;\n•\nVarious plantings and quarterly grains are suggested;\n•\n\
    Estimate the amount of water needed to bring the soil to ﬁeld capacity;\n•\nFarmers\
    \ are advised to consider greenhouses to protect plants from high light intensity\n\
    during summer;\n•\nAdjust water irrigation using automated dripping and sprinkling\
    \ based on environ-\nmental parameters;\n•\nUsing solar panels for powering the\
    \ weather station leads to energy efﬁciency.\nFrom a practical point of view,\
    \ the deployed nodes, which are fed by a solar panel-\nrecharged battery, have\
    \ correctly transmitted data for 12 months, with underground and\naboveground\
    \ sensors and despite bad weather conditions. Indeed, even though some\nsamples\
    \ were lost during several rainy days, once their batteries were recharged by\
    \ solar\nlight during the following sunny days, nodes restarted to transmit properly.\n\
    PL and RSS of the Hata propagation model of the distance between the ground station\n\
    and the drone at the cloud layer show reasonable results, in which the obtained\
    \ values\nsatisfy a high level of reception with the smallest attenuated signal,\
    \ besides achieving line\nof sight wireless connectivity in an efﬁcient and timely\
    \ manner. More elaboration can be\ntaken into consideration for future work, e.g.,\
    \ to develop a machine learning algorithm\nto predict environmental conditions\
    \ and then suggest solutions and/or precautions. A\ndecision support system framework\
    \ could be introduced as part of a future project to link\nthe farm’s smart devices\
    \ together to achieve an autonomous system. Moreover, the power\nconsumption of\
    \ the drone can be optimized to enhance ﬂight time, which leads to covering\n\
    wider farm zones.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, methodology, software,\

    Get rights and content Abstract The projected increases in World population and
    need for food have recently motivated adoption of information technology solutions
    in crop fields within precision agriculture approaches. Internet Of Underground
    Things (IOUT), which consists of sensors and communication devices, partly or
    completely buried underground for real-time soil sensing and monitoring, emerge
    from this need. This new paradigm facilitates seamless integration of underground
    sensors, machinery, and irrigation systems with the complex social network of
    growers, agronomists, crop consultants, and advisors. In this paper, state-of-the-art
    communication architectures are reviewed, and underlying sensing technology and
    communication mechanisms for IOUT are presented. Moreover, recent advances in
    the theory and applications of wireless underground communication are also reported.
    Finally, major challenges in IOUT design and implementation are identified. Previous

    population will increase by 33% in 2050, doubling the need for food [124]. Yet
    today, up to 70% of all water withdrawals are due to food production. This demands
    novel technologies to produce more crop for drop. USDA Agricultural Resource Management
    Survey (ARMS) is the primary source of information on the financial condition,
    production practices, and resource use of America’s farm businesses and the economic
    well-being of America’s farm households. ARMS data show that precision agriculture
    has recently become a widespread practice nationwide. In Fig. 1, adoption rates
    of major precision agriculture approaches (bars) along with the total precision
    agriculture adoption rate (line) are shown for maize for each year of USDA ARMS
    publication (USDA ARMS 2015 version was under development at the time of this
    writing). It can be observed that adoption rate of precision agriculture for maize
    increased from 17.29% in 1997 to 72.47% in 2010 with similar trends observed for
    other crops such as soybean and peanuts. Aside from presenting a growing trend
    in the usage of precision agriculture in maize production, it is evident that
    as new technologies emerge, they are widely adopted by farmers. Download : Download

    technology adoption in maize production (USDA ARMS Data). Among the various precision
    agriculture techniques, crop yield monitoring is the most widely adopted technique
    (61.4%). In addition, guidance and auto-steering system adoption jumped from 5.34%
    in 2001 to 45.16% in nine years. Use of equipment and crop location information
    enables precise control with auto-steering systems which reduce production and
    maintenance costs and reduces repetitive field work for farmers. Despite the drastic
    increase in adoption rates of other techniques, Variable Rate Technology (VRT)
    adoption has been relatively steady, where adoption rate increased from 8.04%
    in 1998 to only 11.54% in 2005. Adaptive application of resources like fertilizers,
    pesticide, and water promises significant gains in crop production but requires
    accurate and timely information from the field. It can be observed that only after
    the adoption of recent crop moisture sensing technology, VRT adoption doubled
    to 22.44% in 2010. During the same period, crop moisture sensing adoption increased
    from 36.21% in 2005 to 51.68% in 2010. It is clear that the success and adoption
    of VRT depends on advancing soil monitoring approaches. Despite being the most
    recent precision agriculture technology, crop moisture sensing has become one
    of the most adopted practices. Yet techniques are still limited to manual data
    collection or limited field coverage. 2. A new paradigm: IOUT Most recently, the
    need for real-time in-situ information from agricultural fields have given rise
    to a new type of IoT: Internet Of Underground Things (IOUT). IOUT represents autonomous
    devices that collect any relevant information about the Earth and are interconnected
    with communication and networking solutions that facilitate sending the information
    out of fields to the growers and decision mechanisms. IOUT is envisioned to not
    only provide in-situ monitoring capabilities (e.g., soil moisture, salinity, and
    temperature), but when interconnected with existing field machinery (irrigation
    systems, harvesters, and seeders) enable complete field autonomy and pave the
    way for more efficient food production solutions. In IOUT, Communications can
    be carried out through the soil and plants from underground devices, and information
    acquired from the field can be sent to the cloud for real-time decision making.
    IOUT applications have unique requirements; i.e., information from soil, operation
    in remote crop fields, wireless communication through plants and soil, and exposure
    to elements. Existing over-the-air (OTA) wireless communication solutions face
    significant challenges because they were not designed for these circumstances.
    As such, IOUT also gives rise to a new type of wireless communications: wireless
    underground (UG) communications [68], [152], where radios are buried in soil and
    wireless communication is conducted partly or completely through the soil. Integration
    of UG communications with IOUT will help conserve water resources and improve
    crop yields [143], [145]. Moreover, advances in IOUT will benefit other applications
    including landslide monitoring, pipeline assessment, underground mining, and border
    patrol [67], [69], [71], [84], [94], [102], [106], [115], [132], [138], [142],
    [146], [150], [152], [159]. This paper presents IOUT for the design of precision
    agriculture solutions. We first discuss functionalities, architecture, and components
    of IOUT. In Section 4 and 5, we present sensing and communication technologies
    of IOUT. In Section 6, we list IOUT testbeds and existing solutions. We conclude
    by discussing challenges of IOUT. 3. IOUT architecture IOUT will consist of interconnected
    heterogeneous devices tailored to the crop and field operations. Common desirable
    functionalities of IOUT are: • In-situ sensing: On board soil moisture, temperature,
    salinity sensors are required for accurate localized knowledge of the soil. These
    sensors can be either integrated on the chip along-with other components of the
    architecture, or they can be used as separate sensors that can be connected to
    the main components. • Wireless communication in challenging environments: Communication
    components of IOUT devices are either deployed on the field or within the soil.
    For OTA communication, solutions should be tailored to the changing environment
    due to irrigation and crop growth. Over the air communication is used to store
    the data on a more secure and accessible service/device. In addition, any system
    on the field is exposed to natural elements and should be designed to sustain
    challenging conditions. Underground communication solutions, while mostly shielded
    from the environment, require the ability to communicate through soil and adjust
    its parameters to adapt to dynamic changes in soil. • Inter-connection of field
    machinery, sensors, radios, and cloud: It is desirable that IOUT architecture
    links a diverse multitude of devices on a crop field to the cloud for seamless
    integration. Accordingly, IOUT architecture will not only provide collected information
    but will also automate operations on the field based on this information. • Real-time
    Decision Making: Information about soil and crop conditions should be available
    to the managers and decision support systems for real-time decision making at
    each level. • Mobility: IOUT will have seamless support for both fixed and mobile
    devices with backing of short-term and long-term communications. Based on these
    main required functionalities, a representative IOUT architecture is illustrated
    in Fig. 2, with the following components. • Underground things (UTs): An UT consist
    of an embedded system with communication and sensing components, where a part
    of or the entire system resides underground. UTs are protected by weatherproof
    enclosures and, in underground settings, watertight containers. Buried UTs are
    protected from the farm equipment, wild rodents, and extreme weather conditions.
    Sensors typically include soil temperature and moisture sensors, but a wide range
    of other soil- or weather-related phenomena can be monitored which will be discussed
    in detail on Section 4. Existing communication schemes include Bluetooth, ZigBee,
    NFC, Wi-Fi, Sigfox, LoRa, LoRaWAN, satellite, cellular, and underground. A UT
    using Bluetooth [105] or underground wireless [86] can communicate over 100 meters,
    commercial products at ISM-band can cover three times larger distances, whereas
    longer-distance connectivity is possible through cellular or satellite. Considering
    the relatively large field sizes, nodes can be configured to form networks capable
    of transferring all the sensed information to a collector sink and self-heal in
    the event that nodes become unreachable (e.g., Irromesh [24]). Nodes are generally
    powered by a combination of batteries and, if on field, solar panels. Cost of
    UTs is expected to be relatively inexpensive as they are deployed by the multitude
    [96]. • Base stations are used as gateways to transfer the collected data to the
    cloud. They are installed in permanent structures such as weather stations or
    buildings. Base stations are more expensive as they are better safe-guarded and
    have higher processing powers and communication capabilities [96]. • Mobile sinks
    are installed in equipment that move around the field periodically or as required,
    such as tractors and irrigation systems [86]. Since irrigation machinery advance
    at a slow pace, the soil data is received ahead of time allowing instant adjustment
    on the water application rate. On the other hand, when weather conditions are
    favorable, turning on the irrigation equipment only for data retrieval purpose
    is expensive. An alternative is to use unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) such as
    quadrotors or ground robots to retrieve the measurements. • Cloud services are

    of such a diverse range of communication architectures makes it challenging to
    form a unified IOUT architecture with the ability to fulfill agricultural requirements
    seamlessly. This is further complicated due to the lack of standard protocols
    for sensing and communication tailored to the IOUT. In the following, we explain
    in detail the sensing (Section 4) and communication (Section 5) mechanisms with
    a focus on desired characteristics of IOUT for real-time sensing and effective
    communications. 4. Sensing The main functionality of IOUT is real-time sensing.
    Sensing has led to adoption of technology in the precision agriculture and it
    also enables improved efficiency of agricultural production and practices [127].
    An overview of sensing technologies is presented next. Soil moisture: Soil moisture
    (SM) sensors have been used for decades in crop fields to measure water content.
    Automated technologies have largely replaced the use of hand-held/manual soil
    moisture technologies because of difficulties associated with taking manual soil
    moisture readings in production fields in remote locations. In the last decade,
    wireless data harvesting technologies have been developed that provide managers
    and users real-time access to soil moisture data which has resulted in more effective
    water management decision-making. Important SM measurement methods are described
    below: • Gravimetric sampling is a direct and standard method of measuring SM.
    It is used to determine the volumetric water content of the soil. This method
    determines SM by a ratio of soil’s dry mass to the wet soil mass including the
    pore spaces. It requires manual sampling and oven drying of soil samples taken
    from the field [91]. • Resistive sensors [50] such as granular matrix sensors
    work on the principal of electrical conductivity of water and measuring resistance
    changes based on soil water content. This method requires calibration of sensors
    for accurate SM reading. • Capacitive sensors measure SM based on changes in capacitance
    of soil due to water content variations. Capacitive sensors, which are generally
    of higher accuracy than resistive sensors but cost more, are being used by commercial
    UTs. • Ground Penetrating Radars (GPR) [66], [98] are based on the absorption
    and reflection of electromagnetic waves. Impulse, frequency sweep, and frequency
    modulated technologies are used in SM sensing. This method is used to measure
    near-surface soil moisture (up to 10 cm). • Neutron scattering probes [87], [92]
    and gauges use radiation scattering techniques to measure SM by estimating changes
    in neutron flux density due to the water content of the soil are the most accurate
    soil moisture probes used in fields. They require specific licenses to be used.
    • Gamma ray attenuation [90], time-domain reflectometry (TDR) [128], and frequency-domain
    reflectometry (FDR) [139] are other popular SM measurement approaches. Common
    SM sensors used in fields are shown in Fig. 3. SM sensors are buried at depths
    of 5  cm to 75  cm in soil depending on the crop type and root depth. SM data
    obtained from these sensors is used to create soil moisture maps which help real-time
    decision making. SM sensors have been deployed in fields with increasing frequency.
    For example, the Nebraska Agricultural Water Management Network [99], [101], was
    established with only 20 growers in 2005 and currently serves over 1400 growers
    to enable the adoption of water and energy conservation practices using SM sensors.
    In addition to in-situ soil moisture sensors, other soil moisture data sources
    are Soil Climate Analysis Network [49], US Climate Reference Network [60], TAMU
    North American Soil Moisture Database [53], Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity [48],
    NASA North American Land Data Assimilation System [27], and NASA Soil Moisture
    Active Passive [46]. These databases contain soil moisture and temperature informations
    of vast geographical areas and augment the Web Soil Survey (WSS) [63], which collects
    and classifies the US soil information by region. Download : Download high-res

    Top row: Gravimetric [91], resistive (Watermark) [50], capacitance [17], Bottom
    Row: GPR [98], TDR [128], neutron probe [92]. Other soil physical properties:
    In addition to soil moisture sensing, other soil properties can be measured to
    populate the soil map such as the organic mater present in the soil, acidity (pH)
    [135], percentage of sand, clay and silt particles [137], and nutrients such as
    Mg, P, OM, Ca, base saturation Mg, base saturation K, base saturation Ca, CEC,
    K/Mg, and Ca/Mg ratios [104], [110], [113]. In-situ, real-time measurement of
    these properties still face challenges due to size, cost, and technology limitations.
    Yield monitoring: Yield monitoring provides spatial distribution of crop yield
    at the end of a growing season and is used make long-term decisions about agriculture
    operations [108], [118]. Yield monitors are usually installed on farm equipment
    and automatically collects yield data during harvesting. More specifically, mass
    flow sensors are installed on grain containers to record grain inflow along with
    location (e.g., Force Sensor by Ag Leader). The collected data is analyzed using
    geographic information system (GIS) tools such as ArchInfo, Mapinfo, and Environment
    System Research International tools. Electrical conductivity and topography surveys:
    The ability of soil to conduct current is measured through soil electrical conductivity
    (EC) [116]. Coupled with field topography (elevation and slope), EC data provides
    an insight into the crop yield. EC (through contact and no-contact methods) is
    used to determine the amount of nitrogen usage, water holding and cation-exchange
    capacity, drainage, and rooting depth. EC maps are used to classify the field
    into zones. Then, precision agriculture practices such as variable rate irrigation,
    variable rate seeding, nitrogen, yield, and drainage management are applied based
    on zoning. EC mapping can be done using apparent electrical conductivity (ECa)
    [88], visible-near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (VNIR) [75], and electromagnetic
    Induction (EMI) [141] approaches. An array of commercial tools are available,
    e.g., Veris 3100 [61], EC400 sensors combined with GPS systems [107] are used
    for EC mapping. Weather and environmental sensing: Weather and environmental sensors
    are used to sense soil and air temperature, direction and speed of winds, and
    other environmental effects such as rainfall, solar emissions and humidity. For
    example, John Deere has introduced sensors to assess these phenomena in their
    commercial Field Connect solution [25]. Availability of this information is useful
    for real-time and fully informed precision agriculture decisions. A mesoscale
    network (MesoNet), consists of nodes for weather and environment sensing, spanning
    over a large geographic area. MesoNet [34] is used to observe major changes in
    weather patterns, and when combined with IOUT sensing can be used to provide real-time
    weather information at the farm level. Soil macro-nutrients sensing: Macro-Nutrients
    such as nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorous are vital for the crop growth. The
    assessment of these nutrients helps to determine the fertilizer impact and future
    applications. Optical sensing is based on reflectance spectroscopy to measure
    the reflection and absorption by these macrosimulation [104], [110], [113]. To
    detect nitrate and sulfate concentration in natural water resources, a sensing
    method using planar electromagnetic sensors has been developed in [121]. This
    method is used to sense nitrate and sulfate levels by correlating the impedance
    of the sensor array with the concentration of these pollutants. It has been shown
    that sensor impedance decreases with increase in concentration of these chemicals
    [121]. Electrochemical, VIS-NIRS spectroscopy, and ATR spectroscopy are the major
    soil macro-nutrients sensing approaches. These soil macro-nutrients sensing approaches
    are limited to sense one desired ion because membrane used in these methods only
    responds to one ion [113]. To achieve concurrent multi-ion sensing, a major challenge
    is to form a detector array for soil macro-nutrients sensing [104]. Remote sensing:
    Remote sensing based approaches uses electromagnetic waves which interact with
    soil and plants in precision agriculture. These approaches work on the measurement
    of intensity of reflected components of the electromagnetic waves as these interact
    with soil and plants [120]. Spatial resolution of remote sensing techniques is
    a major issue; however, when combined with in-situ IOUT sensing approaches, they
    may result in fine resolution, which can be used to produce field maps for analysis
    and decision making in precision agriculture. Examples of these include soil moisture,
    yield [72], texture [140], pesticides applications [95], and nutrient field maps
    [2], [112], [120]. Remote sensing has also applications in satellite data fusion,
    crop structure and condition monitoring. Other precision agriculture technologies:
    A myriad of other technologies is playing vital role in the precision agriculture
    practices. Here we briefly mention these technologies as useful IOUT tools. These
    include precision planting, geolocation, GIS systems, soil sampling and field
    analysis map generation, drones, auto-steering and VRT. In precision planting
    [38], the seeding is done using a very fine predetermined inter plant distance,
    and robots with lasers are used for automatic weed zapping. Farm devices in the
    field are aligned automatically with robovator technology. With GPS, it has become
    possible to divide a farm into different zones based on the field conditions [160].
    Variable rate fertilizer application [2], [78], [95] is also important for crop
    yield improvement. Wireless communications with drones also constitutes a major
    component of the IOUT connectivity. GreenStar Lightbar [15] is a tool from Deere
    & Co that is used to determine the location and width in the row crops. TK-GPS
    [57] is another device used to perform real time soil mapping. The sensing technologies
    discussed in this section present many opportunities for advancing the state of
    precision agriculture through the IOUT. Availability of inexpensive sensors and
    their ability to communicate wireless enables their integrations to control systems
    in IOUT. Therefore, wireless communications, between heterogeneous equipment used
    in these sensor technology, has an important role in realization of the real-time
    decision making in IOUT. Moreover, adoption of sensor technology could be raised
    by a well-connected, reliable, and secure IOUT, and it will also help in development
    of improved sensing technologies in precision agriculture. Because, currently,
    the lack of availability of robust connectivity in the field is hindering rapid
    advancements in sensing technologies. Different approaches for wireless communications
    in IOUT are discussed in the next section. 5. Wireless connectivity Connectivity
    solutions for IOUT can be classified as in-field communications and cloud connectivity
    as discussed next. 5.1. In-field communications In-field communication solutions
    integrate UTs and other communication entities on the field. Most commercial solutions
    utilize OTA communications, whereas IOUT are expected to feature wireless underground
    communications. For short-range communication and networking, license-free standards
    such as Bluetooth, ZigBee, and DASH7 are used in ISM bands. More recently, regulatory
    restrictions are relaxed by the FCC through new rules that allow the use of TV
    white space frequencies in farms [14] (Order No. DA 16-307 Dated: Mar 24, 2016),
    where interference with other licensed devices is not expected. The major challenge
    for OTA communications is the lack of studies about the impacts of crops and farm
    environment on wireless propagation and associated tailored solutions to farms.
    In the following, we discuss in-field communications in detail. UG communications:
    UG communication solutions enable complete concealment of UTs, which decrease
    operation costs and impacts from external elements [86]. For a buried UT radio,
    two types of communication scenarios arise. Aboveground communications involve
    communication between UTs and aboveground devices. Underground communication is
    carried out between UTs. Furthermore, due to the soil-air interface, aboveground
    communication links are not symmetric and need to be analyzed in terms of underground-to-aboveground
    and aboveground-to-underground communication. In Fig. 4, the path loss of these
    links are shown as a result of field experiments [86]. It can be observed that
    practical underground link distances are still limited to 12  m to allow for practical
    multi-hop connectivity. Yet, communication ranges of up to 200  m is possible
    for aboveground communications. Download : Download high-res image (185KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Communication from soil. For UG communications,
    the communication medium is soil, which impacts communication success in six main
    ways: (1) Soil texture and bulk density: EM waves exhibit attenuation when incident
    in soil medium. These variations vary with texture and bulk density of soil. Soil
    is composed of pore spaces, clay, sand, and silt particles. Relative concentration
    of these particles result in 12 soil textural classes [91]. Water holding capacity
    of each soil type is different because of its pore size. For example, lower water
    holding capacity of sandy soil leads to lower attenuation and high root mean square
    delay spread, whereas higher water holding capacities of silt loam and silty clay
    loam soils result in low root mean square delay spread and higher attenuation
    [133], [134]. (2) Soil moisture: The effective permittivity of soil is a complex
    number. Thus, besides diffusion attenuation, EM waves also suffer absorption by
    soil water content and its variations. Soil dielectric spectra and its conductivity
    depends on the soil moisture. The relative dielectric constant range of dry soil
    is between 2 and 6 and its conductivity ranges from to   Si/m, where soils at
    near-saturation level have a relative dielectric constant in the range of 5–15
    and conductivity between to   Si/m [147]. Coherence bandwidth of the underground
    channel is limited to a few hundred KHz range [129], [130], [131], which limits
    data rates. Coherence bandwidth also varies with soil moisture, making design
    of advanced techniques challenging. (3) Distance and depth variations: Sensors
    in IOUT applications are usually buried in the top sub-meter layer. Thus, in addition
    to distance, channel quality depends on deployment depth because of the impacts
    of the soil-air interface, which causes refraction of EM waves. Nodes at higher
    burial depths experience higher attenuation [129]. (4) Antennas in soil: When
    an antenna is buried, its return loss characteristics change due to the high permittivity
    of soil [85], [151]. Moreover, with the variation in soil moisture and hence soil
    permittivity, the return loss of the antenna varies with time too. Changes in
    return loss results in variations in resonant frequency, which is shifted to the
    lower spectrum, and system bandwidth, creating additional challenges for UG communication.
    (5) Frequency variations: The pathloss caused by attenuation is frequency dependent
    because of dipole relaxation associated with water. Generally, lower frequency
    spectrum has lower attenuation, because at higher frequencies, water absorption
    plays a dominant role. In addition, when EM waves propagate in soil, their wavelength
    shortens due to higher permittivity of soil than the air. Therefore, channel capacity
    in soil is also a function of operation frequency [85]. (6) Lateral waves: For
    two UTs, wireless underground communication is conducted through three major paths:
    lateral, direct, and reflected (LDR) waves [86], [130], [133]. Direct and reflected
    waves reside completely in soil and therefore, suffer from the challenges above.
    On the other hand, lateral waves travel partly on the soil-air interface in air,
    experiencing the lowest attenuation. Lateral waves plays an important role in
    extending underground communication ranges. (7) Recent advances in wireless underground
    communications: Recent developments in wireless underground communications include
    the characterization of wireless UG channel and development of environment-aware,
    cross-layer communication solutions to achieve high data rate, long range communications
    with applications to precision agriculture. The impulse response of the wireless
    UG channel is captured and analyzed through extensive experiments [133]. With
    more than 1500 measurement in an underground greenhouse testbed, the effects of
    soil moisture and soil texture on wireless underground communication channel are
    analyzed. Through this analysis, the vital statistics of wireless UG channel impulse
    response (e.g., coherence bandwidth, root mean square delay spread, and power
    associated with multipath) are developed. The three main components of the UG
    channel, direct wave, reflected wave, and the lateral wave are validated. The
    coherence bandwidth of the UG channel has been shown to be less than 1.15  MHz
    which further decreases to 418  kHz for the distances greater than 12  m in soil
    [133]. Change in soil moisture also impacts the root mean square delay spread
    which requires moisture-based dynamic adaptation techniques in UG communications.
    The statistical model [134] is vital for tailored solutions for underground multi-carrier
    communication and soil moisture adaptive beamforming. Based on impulse response
    analysis, the multi-carrier modulation and wireless underground channel diversity
    reception schemes have been developed for the realization of high data rate communications
    [129]. The effects of soil type and moisture on the underground antenna, channel
    and system capacity are highlighted. Based on this analysis, multi-carrier modulation
    and wireless underground channel diversity reception schemes [131] have been developed.
    The optimum maximum ratio combining (MRC-LDR) achieves the maximum gain. In this
    approach, three times SNR enhancement is achieved as compared to the SNR of a
    single antenna matched filter UG receiver. However, the interference from the
    reflected components is still present. Adaptive combining (AC-LDR) uses adaptive
    switching and selection process to suppresses undesired interference. Based on
    the proximity of the LDR receiver, either the D-wave or L-Wave component is dominant
    at the receiver. AC-LDR exploits this by adaptively switching and selecting the
    strongest lateral, or the direct wave. The R-Wave is not considered because it
    is the weakest component and results in performance degradation. In [131], the
    performance analysis of different modulation schemes through simulations and experiments
    has been carried out. The BER under equalization and diversity reception has been
    reported. A 3 times increase in SNR and improvement in BER from to are shown in
    wireless underground communication channel. Since use of sensing technologies
    in precision agriculture depend on reliable UG communications, these is a demand
    for high date rate, ubiquitous, reliable communications. These low error rate
    communication techniques help to achieve that goal in precision agriculture. Moreover,
    based on UG antenna analysis, soil moisture adaptive beamforming (SMABF) using
    underground antenna arrays is also developed [130]. SMABF employs underground
    antenna arrays at the transmitter and omni-directional antenna at the receiver.
    The lateral wave is maximized if the energy from the UG antenna is radiated in
    an optimum angle. In SMABF, beam steering is done to exploit the lateral wave
    in the underground communication by sending the energy in the optimum angle which
    maximizes lateral wave and leads to higher directivity. SMABF has complex array
    structures and needs phase shifters. With these advancements in UG communications,
    it has become possible to make progress from data collection to real-time processing
    and decision making in precision agriculture. Magnetic induction (MI) and acoustic
    UG communications: Magnetic Induction (MI) based communications is another approach
    for UG communications. In magnetic induction [114], [143], the rate of decay of
    received signal strength (RSS) is the inverse cube factor. Therefore, long range,
    high data rates signaling can not be done using MI, which is vital for IOUT paradigm.
    Moreover, the perpendicularity of transmitter and receiver coils (antennas) is
    a prohibiting factor to establish communications in MI. Wavelengths in MI communications
    tend to be large. Therefore, IOUT architecture can not scale with MI based UG
    communications in IOUT. Hence, because of these limiting factors, and due to in-feasibility
    of MI communications to establish communications with aboveground devices, MI
    based communications is not a reliable option for IOUT. EM-based UG communications
    are more suitable. There are also some common characteristics in underwater communication
    [74] and UG communications. However, underwater communications can not utilize
    electromagnetic (EM) waves because of higher degradation of signals and water
    absorption. Therefore, other approaches (e.g., acoustic [74]) are used in underwater
    communications. Moreover, the acoustic approach is infeasible in IOUT UG communications
    because of vibration limitations. Underground to UAV communications: The unmanned
    aerial vehicle (UAVs, also called drones) have recently emerged in the precision
    agriculture practices for sensing and communications of the filed conditions [123],
    [148], agricultural surveillance using imaging [97], [83], and decision support
    [144]. Before the use of UAVs in precision agriculture, the satellite imagery
    was obtained for the purpose of monitoring. Through the use of UAV imaging, a
    detailed soil moisture map of the field can be produced in timely and inexpensive
    manner. Moreover, the crop growth can also be monitored by using UAVs and accordingly
    vegetation index is generated. The seed planting and pesticide applications are
    other important applications of UAVs in precision agriculture. The UAVs, when
    integrated with the IOUT in the field, will require reliable communications with
    sensors and radio equipment for real-time decision making. There are many challenges
    from UG to UAV communications (e.g., restrictions on UAV communications payloads
    and antennas, limited flight times, low communication range from the UG to UAV
    link, and specific operator skills and licenses required for UAV operation). Technology
    and regulatory advances in these areas will lead to enhanced integration of UAVs
    in precision agriculture IOUT. Low power wide area networks (LPWAN): Since IOUT
    is designed for prolonged operation in the agricultural field, energy conservation
    plays important role in long term functionality and connectivity. Low Power Wide
    Area Networks (LPWAN) are designed not only to achieve energy conservation objective
    but also to attain long-range connectivity [122]. Due to this, LPWAN is suitable
    for IOUT communications where high data rate operations are not required and low
    latency of data transfer can be accepted for some applications. According to LPWAN
    Technical Workgroup, it has capacity to work over the time span of many years
    and is specifically designed for applications which need to transmit small packets
    intermittently. A brief overview of LPWAN technologies is given in the following:
    (1) LoRa: Approaches designed to conserve energy like Long Range Wide Area Network
    (LoRaWAN) favor one-hop star topology where end-devices transmit small packets
    of information (0.290–50  kbps) over long distances (up to 45  km in rural areas)
    [80]. This is more suitable for battery powered devices. Reliable communication
    over long distance is possible because of techniques like adaptive data rate,
    LoRa’s chord spread spectrum radio modulation scheme, and gateways that decode
    data received on multiple channels modulated with different spreading factors
    [111]. However, since LoRa uses unlicensed frequency, the channel utilization
    is limited to 30 seconds per day by regulations. For application that requires
    a QoS level, the download channel increase the probability of collisions [81].
    In precision agriculture, LoRa technology provides low-cost low-power communication
    solution for prolonged monitoring operations [29]. (2) Sigfox: Sigfox [44] is
    the first LPWAN technology and highly efficient in spectrum usage. It uses ultra
    narrow band (UNB) modulation. The communication range of Sigfox is up to 45  km
    and 12  km in rural and urban areas respectively. Sigfox supports data rates of
    up to 250  kbps, and also uses unlicensed spectrum (868  MHz and 902  MHz) for
    communications. Consequently, the amount of data that can be transferred daily
    is also limited by regulations [161]. Sigfox provides many opportunities in precision
    agriculture IOUT to support connectivity among field equipment and UT sensors
    [45]. (3) On-Ramp/Ingenu: On-Ramp developed the IEEE 802.15.4k [20] technical
    standard for LWPAN. It only specifies the physical and MAC layer, and upper layers
    are complimented by other standards which operates at the upper layers. It uses
    higher bandwidth (1 MHz) as compared to other LWPAN technologies. IEEE 802.15.4k
    uses 902–928  MHz unlicensed spectrum. Its communication range is up to 15  km.
    Hence, it more suitable for communications agricultural forms spanning over large
    geographical areas [35]. (4) NB-IoT: NB-IoT [154] is a new physical layer standard
    by 3GPP LTE (Release 13). It can coexist with LTE and GSM. NB-IoT also uses narrowband
    signal and is meant for low data rate applications. It only uses 180  KHz of its
    200  KHz bandwidth. NB-IoT operates in licensed spectrum and uses same band as
    of LTE. It supports standalone operation, broadband operation, and in-band operation.
    NB-IoT is also being used in many commercial agricultural solutions in Europe
    [32]. It also facilitates low-cost, long range, and prolonged battery life solutions
    in precision agriculture. (5) Extended coverage GSM IoT: EC-GSM-IoT [12] is another
    low power long range LWPAN standard based on software update to cellular eGPRS.
    It can also co-exist with other mobile networks and designed to support battery
    life of up to 10 years. It operates in 800  MHz to 900  MHz and 1800 to 1900  MHz
    GSM bands. Many features of EC-GSM-IoT (e.g., inexpensive equipment, long range
    and coverage) makes it suitable for IOUT communication in precision agriculture.
    NWave [33], Platanus [36], Weightless [64], and Ingenu [20] are other major notable
    LPWAN technologies, which can be used for IOUT communications depending on the
    deployment, application, energy requirement, and equipment. These are also being
    used in precision agriculture connected vineyards [11]. Wireless PAN/LAN: Wireless
    PAN/LAN is also important for communications between farm machinery and equipment,
    field workers and central base stations in the field. Use of Wireless LAN/PAN
    enables high data rate, low latency communication in IOUT, which are not supported
    by LPWAN. Wireless PAN/LAN include many technologies such as Bluetooth, ZigBee,
    Thread, and Wi-Fi. In the following we present brief overview of these technologies:
    (1) Bluetooth: Bluetooth [5] is standardized by Special Interest Group (SIG).
    Communication can be done up to 100  m distances and it uses frequency hopping
    spread spectrum technique. Bluetooth Smart is the low energy version and can operate
    in broadcast and connected mode. Bluetooth uses 2.4  GHz ISM band and has bandwidth
    up to 25  MHz. It is also being used in development of a low energy moisture-
    and temperature sensor intended for use in an agricultural wireless sensor network
    system [76]. (2) ZigBee: ZigBee [65] operates on the top of 802.15.4 MAC/PHY and
    it consists of application and network layer protocols. It can operate in a star
    and mesh topology with bandwidth up to 1  MHz and communication range of up to
    10 to 30 meters. A smart agriculture system by using ZigBee technology has been
    developed in [117]. (3) Thread: Thread [56], self-healing mesh network protocol,
    functions on IEEE 802.15.4 MAC/PHY and is simple and secure battery friendly LAN
    protocol. It can supports up to 250 devices and provides security at network and
    application layers. (4) Wi-Fi: IEEE 802.11 [19] is high data rate communication
    standard with support for data rates higher than 1  Gbps. It has physical layer
    standards for different ISM bands (2.4  GHz, 5  GHz and 60  GHz) and used different
    channel bandwidth up to 160  MHz. A remote monitoring system using WiFi, where
    the wireless sensor nodes are based on WSN802G modules, has been developed in
    [119]. Cellular technology in IOUT: As more and more IOUT applications are being
    developed, the demand for cellular and broadband connectivity IOUT solutions is
    reaching at critical levels. Lack of broadband cellular communication in rural
    areas is a major challenge as it hinders instant access to big data being generated
    from the field. Currently, data has to be collected and transmitted manually from
    the deployed IOUT systems which is major bottleneck in adoption of precision agriculture
    practices in remote rural areas. One main factor for non-existent or slow cellular
    data communication speeds is the huge expenditure on commissioning of required
    infrastructure rural communities. There are also many system and cost related
    challenges in Machine-to-Machine (M2M) cellular communications [70] as main purpose
    of cellular design was human communications. However, a recent release of LTE
    cellular standard has the support for M2M communications and can be used for communication
    in production fields being served with LTE networks. However, IOUT devices are
    required to be compatible with the cellular standard and energy consumption challenges
    restricts their use in battery powered devices for prolonged duration. To overcome
    these challenges, low power devices can be connected through in-field communications
    and subsequently data can be collected and transmitted to the cloud by using externally
    powered gateways with cellular capabilities. Energy consumption in IOUT: In IOUT,
    energy consumption is a vital issue because of the low power requirement for sensors
    in order to operate for prolonged periods without battery replacement. Moreover,
    the channel quality in UG communications is impacted by physical parameters of
    the soil (e.g., soil moisture). In [84], a connectivity model of IOUT for different
    soil physical parameters has been developed by designing the cluster size distribution
    under sub-critical constraints. A novel aboveground communication coverage model
    for underground clusters has been developed. To maintain connectivity while reducing
    energy consumption the transmit power control and environment aware routing are
    proposed. It is shown that these approaches can maintain network connectivity
    under all soil moisture conditions while reducing energy consumption. Moreover,
    it has also been shown that use of relaying nodes based on soil wetness conditions
    can further decrease the energy consumption. 5.2. Cloud and big data in precision
    agriculture Due to limited processing power and energy considerations, data processing
    and decision making are not generally conducted locally. Depending on privacy
    considerations, field information can be stored in a private database, provided
    to the public databases, or shared with other users [157]. There are online marketplaces
    where big data sets and agricultural apps are used to analyze a region and make
    decisions to maximize crop yield [136]. Additionally, in-situ SM sensors can be
    linked to national soil moisture databases for complete, accurate, and comprehensive
    information of soil moisture [27], [46], [48], [49], [53], [60], [63]. With the
    support of cloud services, real-time visualization and decision support can be
    provided. Therefore, Cloud can be used as a hub of data storage and processing
    applications in precision agricultural. Moreover, Cloud allows the scalability
    of IOUT paradigm from the field level to bigger geographic areas by forming network
    of farms. On the other hand, in the absence of storage or processing constraints,
    base stations on the fields can pull meteorological data from a weather service
    or soil information from a national service, fuse this information with in-situ
    data from UTs, and control the farming equipment. To have a fully automated system,
    farming equipment should include a controller that can be accessed remotely. The
    integration of IOUT with creates new avenues to form robust stakeholders in precision
    agriculture such as growers, industry, and trading companies and would results
    in increased efficiency and sustainability of whole precision agriculture ecosystem.
    In addition to integration of farm equipment data to soil and weather databases,
    other examples include linking UAVs and robotics to precision agriculture paradigm.
    Irrespective of in-situ or cloud processing, the main challenge is the integration
    of heterogeneous systems. Moreover, reliable data transfer from field to cloud,
    and cloud to farm, will constitute an important functionality of the IOUT cloud
    architecture. This functionality will not only help connect fields over vast geographical
    areas to the cloud, but will also facilitate local farms to use this data for
    assessment and improvement of crop yield. Moreover, there is a need of development
    of standardized interfaces for seamless connectivity and collaboration between
    different components of the precision agriculture ecosystem. The IOUT paradigm
    enables sensing and communications of even minor changes in the field including
    change in physical properties of the soil and growth of plants. Major sources
    of big data in precision agriculture are ESA satellite images, NDVI from drones,
    user maps (yield, electrical conductivity, and others), and soil data. This process
    generates big data and it becomes very important to extract meaningful information
    from this huge amount of data. This is also crucial for real-time end user decision
    making and in evaluation of return on investment. Therefore, it is necessary to
    develop big data analytics in precision agriculture [156]. It is also essential
    to analyze the reduction in input cost in water resources, energy consumption
    and labor cost by adopting precision agriculture practices [73]. Other examples
    of the big data analytics in precision agriculture are factors affecting crop
    yield; and demarcation of field zones based on particular application such as
    productivity, soil moisture, nutrients, harvesting. Farmers, as the biggest stakeholder
    in the precision agriculture, need to use the technology to see the potential
    benefits with out being overloaded with the data. Therefore, the big data analytics
    to show increase in crop yield and improvement in overall production efficiencies,
    which can deliver tangible benefits, are vital for success of the whole precision
    agriculture ecosystem. 6. An overview of IOUT enabling technologies and testbeds
    In this section, we present an overview of enabling technologies which facilitate
    IOUT developments for system-wide and communication-specific challenges. 6.1.
    Academic IOUT systems IOUTs can be used to ascertain the amount of water and fertilizer
    to be applied using an irrigation control system. An IOUT testbed has been deployed
    on the South Central Agricultural Lab (SCAL) in Clay Center, Nebraska [86]. The
    testbed covers a 41 acres of research field where an advanced center pivot irrigation
    system was installed in 2005 to research long-term dynamics of variable rate irrigation
    and fertigation, crop water and nutrient uptake, water stress and yield relationships,
    develop crop production functions, and associated numerous topics under full and
    limited irrigation and rainfed settings [100]. In this testbed, a mobile sink
    is installed on one of the controller towers of the center pivot irrigation system
    [86]. The current configuration includes two antennas facing opposite directions
    allowing the reception of data from nodes at a distance of 150  m–200  m. A solar
    panel provides sustainable energy in the field. 10–16 buried UTs are deployed
    in the field. Each UT is capable of measuring soil temperature and soil moisture
    from four external sensors buried at depths of 1, 2, 3, and 4  ft. UTs are powered
    by lithium-ion batteries and protected by a watertight enclosure. The spatio-temporal
    real-time information from UT is fused at the mobile sink and sent to the cloud
    using 4G communications. The cloud communicates with the center pivot controller
    for automated irrigation control. This field testbed is fully functional system
    developed to investigate IOUT sensing and communications capabilities in an agriculture
    field using center pivot irrigation, sensors, aboveground and underground communication
    devices. An indoor testbed has been designed and developed inside the greenhouse
    which supports dynamic soil moisture control for wireless underground communication
    experiments [133]. The testbed is made of 100  in. long, 36  in. wide and 48  in.
    high wooden box with drainage system to hold 90 cubic feet of packed soil (Fig.
    5). Antennas are buried at different depths and distances for controlled wireless
    communication experiments. Download : Download high-res image (203KB) Download

    based on magnetic induction (MI) underground communications has been developed
    in [143]. This testbed includes coils buried in the underground in lab settings.
    MI wave guide effects and 3-D coils are investigated using this testbed in different
    soil configurations. SoilBED [89], is another underground testbed developed for
    cross-well radar experiments in soil. It is used for investigation of EM wave
    propagation and for detection of presence of contaminated materials in soil. SoilBED
    can also be used for underground channel and antenna characterization, and empirical
    validations of underground communication channel models. Thoreau [161] is an IOUT
    testbed on an university campus that collects and curates time and geo-tagged
    data on an open platform on the cloud. It is based on Sigfox design and operates
    in the 900  MHz unlicensed bands with frequency hopped and narrow-band operation.
    It has very low data rates and soil properties including soil temperature, soil
    moisture, electric conductivity, and water potential are measured. Another precision
    agriculture testbed has been developed for real-time sensing in the field [79].
    It is used to sense related soil properties for real-time decision making. BioSense
    [4] Institute is an R&D institute for IT in biosystems. To achieve their vision
    on the future of agriculture and food production, BioSense works on the areas
    of machinery auto-steering and automation, EC probe & XRF scanner, electrical
    conductivity map, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) map, yield map,
    remote sensing, nano and micro-electronic sensors, big data, and Internet of things
    aimed to food production. BioSense Institute, supported by University of Novi
    Sad, Serbia, focuses on the design development of advanced ICT solutions in agriculture,
    food, ecology, environmental protection, and forestry. Research results of BioSense
    Institute are helping European countries and regions to improve agricultural and
    environmental standards. It is also working in nano and microelectronics, communications
    and signal processing, remote sensing and GIS, robotics and mechatronics, knowledge
    discovery, and BIO-related research fields such as agriculture, ecology, environmental
    sciences, and forestry. It consists of many researchers from various fields labs
    from Europe. Their solution for Big Data is AgroSense [3], an agricultural platform
    which store and present information to farmers, agri-companies, government, banks,
    and insurance companies aimed toward improving crop yield while reducing costs.
    Internet of Food and Farm (IoF2020) [22] is an European project that has 19 use
    cases in 5 agri-food production sectors: arables, fruits, vegetables, dairy, and
    meat. An example in arable is the combination of data from sensor networks for
    smart wheat management with crop models and other data sources (e.g., disease,
    crop stage detection, cultivar characterization from phenotyping, and others)
    to generate high spatial-temporal resolution and to develop new models. In fruits,
    a fresh table grapes chain project uses information from weather station and wired
    sensor (soil moisture, soil temperature, electrical conductivity, and leaf wetness)
    for disease forecasting and to control irrigation using flow meters and solenoid
    valves. Solar powered data loggers transmit the data using GPRS network. A case
    study in vegetable is the tracking of greenhouse tomato-crops chain by setting
    the optimum ambient conditions to reduce the usage of resources (e.g., pesticide
    application could be avoided completely) and increase energy efficiency. In dairy,
    15 grazing cows are tracked on the pasture and inside the dairy barn using three
    beacons. A case in meat is the tracking of pigs using RFID tags, which reduces
    boar taint, health problems, and improve productivity. Sensor are also used for
    climate monitoring, register weight gain, feeding and drinking patterns, and food
    and water consumption. A ZigBee based IOUT has been developed in [158] with application
    in precision agriculture. Related soil properties such as humidity and pH are
    sensed using this architecture. An IOUT for soil moisture sensing at multiple
    depths has been developed in [125]. It consists of wireless communications nodes,
    sensors, data transfer gateways, and web modules for real time sensing, communication,
    and visualization in the field. An IOUT testbed for snow and soil moisture monitoring
    has been developed in Sierra Nevada, California [103] . With 300 sensors spanning
    over an area of multiple kilometers, this IOUT sensing testbed is used to record
    measurements of soil water content, snow depth, matric potential, and other related
    parameters; and a detailed sensing, and communication performance analysis data
    is also reported. A summary of the existing academic architectures is provided

    products, OTA wireless communication is utilized, where the UT includes a variety
    of high-end sensors that measure properties like soil moisture, temperature, and
    electrical conductivity. Consequently, measurements generally represent a single
    point in the field. UT’s can interconnect to create a communication mesh, but
    in most cases, they are connected directly to a tower in the field with cellular
    or satellite communication capabilities. If the UT is not buried underground,
    redeployment of the equipment is needed after planting and before harvesting in
    each growing season to avoid damages to the equipment by the farming machinery.
    A classification of the commercial IOUT solutions, companies, and their products
    are presented in Fig. 6. Modularity in the design of IOUT devices is highly desirable
    as the requirements can change over time and are tailored for a specific application.
    For example, the transmission range influence the selection of a protocol and
    the transceiver that can meet the communication demands. Solutions could be customized
    for a specific application and ordered as a complete solution, so they will work
    out-of-the box. There are companies that specialize in agricultural solutions.
    In other cases, the architecture is required to be more specific and fast prototyping
    using OEM components is more appropriate. Once data is collected, end-users need
    networks to transmit the data, servers for storage and processing, and cloud-based
    applications to display the information. A summary of the commercial solutions
    is provided in Table 2. Major classes of the commercial solutions are highlighted
    in the following. • Agricultural solutions.John Deere’s Field Connect uses 3G
    connections to transmit information from eight sensor probes located a mile away
    (three if satellite communication is used) that measure soil moisture at various
    depth, temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, rain, and leaf wetness.
    MimosaTEK provides irrigation and fertigation solutions scaled to small, medium,
    and large farms [31]. TempuTech [55] provide wireless solutions to monitor temperature
    and humidity in grain elevators. Microsoft is developing FarmBeats which is an
    AI & IoT based platform for Agriculture [13]. These commercial agricultural solutions
    provide full support in precision agriculture including sensing, communications,
    and the cloud. • Out-of-the-box packages.Smartrek Technologies develops wireless
    nodes for different types of sensors and gateways that can be set up easily into
    a network mesh [47]. Nodes are protected by weatherproof enclosures which is a
    requirement for farm outdoor setting. Accessible ports allows the installation
    of third-party soil moisture sensors and weather detection. Libelium has developed
    a Plug & Sense Smart Agriculture solution [37] for temperature and humidity sensing,
    rainfall, wind speed and direction, atmospheric pressure, soil water content,
    and leaf wetness. Libelium provides platforms and end-user devices that encompass
    communications standards such as LoRaWAN, LoRa, Sigfox, sub GHz, ZigBee, DigiMesh,
    WiFi, RFID, NFC, Bluetooth/BLE, 3G, 4G, and GPRS. Sensor boards can be connected
    to their Waspmote platform to attach 120 different sensors. Libelium also hosts
    an IoT marketplace and provides cloud services to manage IoT devices and online
    programming. Cropx’s [8] IOUT consists of hardware and software components used
    to measure soil moisture, temperature, and EC for real time irrigation decision
    making. PrecisionHawk has developed an IOUT platform [39] using drones, which
    is used for sensing and field map generation. It supports visual imaging, thermal
    and multi-spectral imaging for field map generation in precision agriculture.
    These out-of-the-box packages are important component of the precision agriculture
    to support different types of applications. • OEM components.OEM components are
    commonly used in the manufacturing of nodes at a large scale. However, the prototyping
    or small scale production of very specific UT will also required the selection
    of OEM devices. ST [51] develops internal components for IoT devices like accelerometers,
    gyroscope, and MEMS microphones. Semtech Corporation is a supplier of high-performance
    semiconductors and advanced algorithms [41]. U-blox specialized in communication
    and positioning components for IoT devices [59]. Telit is an M2M solutions company
    with focus in IoT development [54]. Telit provides tailored hardware and software
    solutions in small size modules. Products can transmit data using cellular, Bluetooth/BLE,
    LoRa, Low Power Wide Area (LPWA), Positioning, SigFox, Sub GHz, Wi-Fi, and M-Bus
    wireless technology. Herelab provides proof of concept deployment and rapid prototyping
    service of IoT custom platforms [16]. For instance, in agriculture, sensor interfaces
    can be rapidly attached to a template, and the corresponding instructions can
    be adapted from the code library. Herelab also organizes labs and workshop to
    introduce new tools and promote the usage of IoT devices. These components serve
    as useful building blocks of IOUT sensing and communications paradigm. • Cloud-based
    services.Cloud service allows worldwide access to the information collected by
    IOUT devices without any previous web programming knowledge. Farmers and other
    professionals do not need to spend time to hire another party in order to configure
    a server to make use of the data collected; and can take decision right away.
    LORIoT provides cloud services on a geographical distributed low latency network
    of servers where users connect their LoRaWan gateways. Among the web services
    they offer are the management of devices, cloud storage of data, safeguard of
    encryption keys, and LoRaWan to IP/IPv6 translation [30]. MyDevices offers IoT
    developers services to promote their solutions. One attractive feature of MyDevices
    is that it offers Cayenne, a drag-and-drop IoT project builder. End-users can
    create an account and use Cayenne web and mobile applications to register their
    IoT devices and instantly display sensed data on a fully customizable dashboard
    [6]. Senet operates two public cloud-based networks, Managed Network Services
    for IoT (MNSi) and Low Power Wide Area Virtual Network (LVN), that provide secure,
    efficient, and scalable connectivity to low-powered devices [42]. A proprietary
    network operating system handles end-devices messages and LoRaWAN gateways, generation
    of keys for encryption, decryption of messages, and hosting the portal for device
    management, among other activities. Device Lynk offers an online dashboard for
    data visualization of data captured using IoT industrial devices [9]. IntelliFarms
    provides diverse agricultural solutions such as reporting weather conditions,
    providing market crop pricing, and monitoring storage conditions in silos and
    bins. It also host the IntelliFarms platform where customer can get access to
    all their solutions in a centralized fashion [21]. 365FarmNet platform [1] is
    an agricultural data management service that is currently offering free field
    mapping for precision agriculture. Research challenges in IOUT are presented in

    challenges Challenges in design and implementation of a precision agriculture
    based IOUT are highlighted in this section. 1. Due to large area of deployment
    in agricultural fields, low cost and low complexity IOUT devices are desirable
    with ability to sustain rough terrains in all type of soil moisture regimes. 2.
    Improving UTs with more complex functionalities will lead to higher energy consumption
    and faster battery depletion. Thus, improvements in energy efficient operation,
    sustainable energy sources, and energy harvesting are major challenges. 3. Due
    to availability of different types of SM sensors, their integration with communication
    equipment is a major challenge. A standard protocol is required for seamless integration
    of different types of sensors to the communication devices in IOUT. 4. Low-cost
    and multi-modal soil sensors that can sense soil physical properties in addition
    to moisture are required. While moisture provides valuable information for irrigation
    decisions, soil chemicals need to be sensed in-situ for variable rate fertigation
    applications. 5. Advanced security mechanisms are required to protect information
    transfer in the fields. Moreover, field-based privacy solutions are required such
    that information from multiple fields can be fused for more accurate decisions
    while preserving the privacy of growers. 6. Seasonal changes and crop growth cycles
    need to be considered as they temporarily alter the conditions in which the equipment
    typically works. Freezing temperature affects power consumption, but equipment
    can be set to deep sleep as monitoring might not be necessary. The beginning of
    the growing season or a crop rotation can introduce heavier equipment on the field
    and UTs need to be buried deep enough to avoid damages. 7. Due to dynamic changes
    in the communication medium in soil, UTs should be able to autonomously adjust
    their operation parameters such as operation frequency, modulation schemes, error
    coding schemes for adaptive operation. Due to the close interactions with soil,
    these solutions should be tailored to UG communications instead of adopting existing
    OTA solutions [86], [129], [130], [131], [133]. Impacts of soil physical properties,
    soil moisture on UG communication should be modeled. A detailed insight into these
    effects will help to realize a reliable, scalable IOUT architecture. 8. Impacts
    of soil physical properties, soil moisture on UG communication should be modeled.
    A detailed insight into these effects will help to realize a reliable, scalable
    IOUT architecture. 9. Specialized link-layer and network layers protocols are
    needed for UG communications for scalable, reliable, and robust data transfer
    in IOUT. 8. Conclusions We introduced the Internet of Underground Things (IOUT)
    for real-time decision making in agricultural fields. A complete architectures
    for precision agriculture based IOUT has been presented. It has been shown that
    the sensing and communications are the main component of the IOUT. A detailed
    overview of sensing and communication technologies including academic and commercial
    solutions is presented. In-field communications (UG, LPWAN, LAN, cellular) and
    cloud are discussed in detail. Challenges to the realization of IOUT are highlighted,
    and testbed designs for IOUT realization are presented. Recent advances in the
    theory and applications of wireless UG communication are also reported. Acknowledgments

    Abstract Advances in Internet of Things (IoT) based sensing systems have improved
    capabilities to precisely monitor environmental conditions. Plants are sessile
    organisms and are affected by biotic and abiotic stresses caused due to surrounding
    environmental conditions such as soil water content, pest/disease infestation,
    and soil health. High-resolution sensing (Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) Systems)
    of agro-meteorological parameters helps to solve critical issues about the crop-weather-soil
    continuum. Currently, many WSN systems are deployed all over the World for precision
    agriculture purposes. Although there have been many improvements in the communication
    aspects of the WSN''s, the data dissemination and near real-time analysis components
    for taking dynamic decision, particularly in agriculture domain has not matured.
    The current WSN systems do not have a standardized way of data discovery, access,
    and sharing, which impedes the integration of data across various distributed
    sensor networks. This study addresses above issues through the adaptation of a
    framework based on Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards for Sensor Web Enablement
    (SWE). For precision agriculture applications a cost-effective, standardized sensing
    system (hardware and software) has been developed, which includes functionalities
    such as sensors plug-n-play, remote monitoring, tools for crop water requirement
    estimation, pest, disease monitoring, and nutrient management. Also, the modeling
    techniques were integrated with the interoperable web-enabled sensing system for
    addressing water management problems of horticultural crops in semi-arid areas.

    Sensor Network 1. Introduction Agriculture is an important sector which drives
    the economy and food security of many nations. Various kinds of sensing systems
    are emerging in the area of precision agriculture in which the current trend is
    towards the design and development of cost-effective, energy efficient and fault
    tolerant Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) for various monitoring and management
    applications. The focus of recent research is on improving and sustaining the
    productivity of different crops. Current advances in Information Communication
    and Dissemination Technologies (ICDT''s) have well proven their ability in information
    and knowledge dissemination. Globally, the ICDT initiatives in the field of agriculture
    have shown that with accurate monitoring and analysis of crop/weather parameters,
    it is possible to judiciously allocate available resources in agriculture (Nash
    et al., 2009, Lee et al., 2010, Prabhakar et al., 2010, Li et al., 2011). Several
    WSNs are being deployed in many countries, and have a wide range of applications
    in agriculture, such as: • Crop/pest disease monitoring (Riquelme et al., 2009,
    Tripathy et al., 2011). • Crop water management (Panchard et al., 2006, Panchard
    et al., 2007, uAgri C-DAC, 2013, Sudharsan et al., 2012, Ojha et al., 2015). •
    Crop yield prediction (Honda et al., 2009, Sudharsan et al., 2011). • Weather
    based advisory services (IMD, 2016, ISRO, 2015, mKRISHI, 2016). In general, several
    dissemination systems are currently being deployed, which enables the discovery,
    access and retrieval of various meteorological, biophysical, ocean and coastal
    water quality parameters. This kind of systems can be divided into two types:
    (1) Stovepipe or standalone systems which provide sensor details (i.e. metadata,
    observations and measurements) in their own formats (Panchard et al., 2006, Panchard
    et al., 2007, Riquelme et al., 2009, Sudharsan et al., 2011, Sudharsan et al.,
    2012, Tripathy et al., 2011, Ojha et al., 2015). (2) Interoperable systems and
    platforms which implement commonly agreed standards for sensor metadata, observation
    and measurement representation (Korduan et al., 2004, Murakami et al., 2007, Mizoguchi
    et al., 2008, Nash et al., 2009, Durbha et al., 2010, Nikkilä et al., 2010, Bröring
    et al., 2011a, Bröring et al., 2011b, Patil et al., 2012, Sawant et al., 2012,
    Jazayeri et al., 2012, Liang and Huang, 2013, Chen et al., 2015, Du et al., 2016,
    Geipel et al., 2016). However, there is a paucity of standards driven, interoperable
    systems in the Agriculture domain that severely impedes the discovery and access
    of data across Agri-WSN''s. For example, to answer a question such as “What is
    the crop water requirement during a particular crop growth stage?, there is a
    need for weather parameters such as air temperature, relative humidity, solar
    radiation, wind speed, and rainfall. from weather station and crop growth stage
    information from field/cultivation practice. It''s hard for users from diverse
    areas of study to understand the exact lineage of the collected data i.e. how
    the measurement is transformed into an observation. It is possible that the measurement
    has gone through various transformations (e.g. application calibration curves),
    which can also give rise to heterogeneous data formats (Comma Separated Values
    (CSV), Tab Separated Values (TSV), EXtensible Markup Language (XML), etc.). With
    this ever increasing spread of WSNs, there is a need for standard sets of specifications
    (both syntactic and semantic) and encodings to bring multiple sensor networks
    on a common platform (Durbha et al., 2010, Bröring et al., 2011a, Patil et al.,
    2012, Liang and Huang, 2013). Which enables the development of geographically
    distributed systems that are standardized at the semantic (Folmer and Verhoosel,
    2011, Compton et al., 2012) and Syntactic (Bröring et al., 2011b) level for regional
    agricultural practices planning (i.e. irrigation, pest/disease management, etc.).
    The initiatives such as, FOODIE: Farm-Oriented Open Data in Europe (Esbri et al.,
    2014), GeoCENS: Geospatial Cyberinfrastructure for the World-Wide Sensor Web (Liang
    and Huang, 2013), Sensor Asia (Mizoguchi et al., 2008) and Service Oriented Architecture
    for sensor data discovery in agriculture (Patil et al., 2012, Sawant et al., 2012,
    Chen et al., 2015), are some of the attempts towards facilitating the interoperability
    and sensor data discovery. These studies have shown the utility of Open Geospatial
    Consortium (OGC) specified Sensor Observation Service (SOS) standards for sensor
    data access from geographically distributed sensing systems (OGC, 2016, Bröring
    et al., 2012, Bröring et al., 2011a). Keeping in view of the requirement of a
    sensing and analysis platform in the ever increasing precision agriculture area,
    the specific objectives of this paper are: • to design a sensor platform (hardware)
    with integrated SWE architecture for precision agro-meteorological monitoring
    • to integrate the OGC''s Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) standards to achieve interoperability
    and scalability of heterogeneous sensing systems • to demonstrate the utility
    of such interoperable sensing systems for agro-meteorological monitoring and potential
    evapotranspiration estimation. This paper is organized into various sections:
    Section 2 describes the design of sensor platform (hardware) and integration of
    sensor web architecture (software) for agriculture monitoring. A case study on
    the application of interoperable sensor system for crop water requirement analysis
    is described in Section 3. Section 4 presents results and discussions on the integrated
    sensor web system and its utility for crop water requirement analysis. Section
    5 concludes with a comparison between current SWE initiatives for precision agriculture
    and a description of the future work. 2. Materials and methods The sensor web
    enablement framework of the agro-meteorological observation and analysis platform
    consists of three layers: (1) Sensing systems, (2) Sensor Web Enablement (middleware)
    and (3) Web based visualization layer (Fig. 1). Below is a description of each

    The sensing systems layer comprise of the network of geographically distributed
    heterogeneous sensing systems (i.e. a set of standalone and interoperable sensing
    platforms). 2.1.1. Development of an interoperable sensing platform An interoperable
    wireless sensing system (henceforth called as SenseTube) has been designed using
    low powered System on Chip (SoC) single board computer (i.e. Raspberry Pi/R-Pi,
    Raspberry Pi (2016)) as a data collection and dissemination platform (Fig. 2a)
    (Sawant et al., 2015). Multiple sensor nodes (child nodes) can be interfaced with
    the SenseTube base station. Download : Download high-res image (226KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Interoperable sensing system, (a) system hardware
    block diagram and (b) interoperable sensor data communication architecture. Field
    level node to node communication has been established using Wi-Fi (i.e. IEEE 108.11)
    communication protocol (Fig. 2b) (Sawant et al., 2015). The General Purpose Input
    Output (GPIO) pins of SoC hardware are utilized to connect the Analog to Digital
    Converter (ADC), and through Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) the data is collected.
    The ADC has eight analog channels for connecting external sensors. The resolution
    of ADC is 10 bit thereby facilitating to interface analog sensors such as temperature,
    and humidity. The digital (raw) voltage observations collected from ADC are converted
    into physical measurements and stored onboard. The sensor sampling and polling
    frequency can be adjusted through the configuration interface. The default sampling
    interval has been set to fifteen minutes and polling frequency to one hour. The
    sensing system comprises of sensor node collecting observations at fixed interval.
    The sensing system can be configured as a base station and child node. When set
    as base station sensor node receive observations and measurements from distributed
    child nodes and transmit over remote address/service. The child node configuration
    provides a capability to receive and locally transfer sensor observations and
    measurements to the base station. Table 1 lists sensing system configurations
    for interoperable sensing system (SenseTube). Table 1. Sensing system configuration.

    Convertor (ADC) 10 bit 2. Number of analog channels 8 channels 3. Sampling frequency
    15 min 4. Polling frequency 1 h Existing infrastructure of Internet Service Providers
    (ISP''s) has been utilized in the present study for internet connectivity. Normally,
    the ISP''s dynamically assign Internet Protocol (IP) address to the field based
    sensing system, this configuration brings out two cost-effective approaches to
    communicate with the data processing layer: (1) through Virtual Private Network
    (VPN) server configured on fixed IP addressed remote/cloud service platform (Liu,
    2000), (2) using cost-effective cloud service (e.g. ownCloud, Dropbox, etc.) which
    is easily accessible to both the field based sensing system and remote/cloud based
    data processing server (ownCloud, 2016, Dropbox, 2016). Direct reliable and secure
    access to SWE sensing platform facilitate the on-board data processing (i.e. estimate
    reference evapotranspiration, daily minimum/maximum temperature, humidity, etc.).
    The remote/cloud based data processing server can access the field nodes using
    SWE requests such as GetCapabilities, DescribeSensor, and GetObservation detailed
    information about communication between field based interoperable sensing systems,
    and sensor data storage and data analysis layer (middleware) is described in the
    subsequent section. 2.1.2. Existing standalone sensing systems Various studies
    have provided methodologies for SWE of standalone (the sensing systems which provide
    sensor details in their formats) sensing systems (Patil et al., 2012, Sawant et
    al., 2012, Liang and Huang, 2013, Chen et al., 2015). A wrapper (a piece of software
    to transform sensor observations) is necessary to make standalone sensing system
    into OGC standardized, interoperable sensing system. The method for design of
    Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) proposed by Patil et al., 2012, Sawant et
    al., 2012 has been used for regional Automatic Weather Station (AWS). This methodology
    facilitates the integration of standalone AWS into interoperable sensor web layer.
    2.2. Sensor web enablement layer (Middleware) The SWE layer provides sensor data
    polling and processing facility. The OGC standards such as SOS, Observations and
    Measurements (O&M), Sensor Model Language (Sensor ML), and Web Processing Service
    (WPS) are used to establish communication between sensing systems and client interface.
    2.2.1. Background 2.2.1.1. Sensor model language The Sensor ML has the primary
    objective to provide a robust and semantically-tied means of defining processes
    and processing components associated with the measurement and post-measurement
    transformation of observations. This includes sensors and actuators as well as
    computational processes applied pre- and post-measurement (Botts and Robin, 2007).
    In sensor web enablement architecture shown in Fig. 1, SensorML encoding is used
    to define each sensor of the sensing system. The sensor details include observed
    property, transducer information, manufacturer, geographical location, etc. The
    detailed description about sensor Observations and Measurements is discussed in
    subsequent section. 2.2.1.2. Observations and measurements The OGC O&M standard
    specifies an XML implementation for the OGC and ISO Observations and Measurements
    (O&M) conceptual model, including a schema for sampling features. The O&M encoding
    is an essential dependency for the SOS interface standard as it defines XML schemas
    for observations and for features involved in sampling when making observations
    (Cox, 2011). The O&M specifications are used to formulate the response to the
    GetObservation request which is comprised of observed properties and constrained
    by observation schema definitions (Fig. 1). The GetObservation request states
    the feature of interest with begin and end timestamp and observed properties.
    The details of SOS component is described in subsequent section. 2.2.1.3. Sensor
    observation service The OGC SOS standard defines a web service interface which
    allows querying observations, sensor metadata, as well as representations of observed
    features. Further, this standard defines means to register new sensors and to
    remove existing ones. Also, it defines operations to insert new sensor observations
    (Bröring et al., 2011a, Bröring et al., 2012, Na and Priest, 2007). The SOS stores
    time series sensor observations in a relational database and facilitates the formulation
    of response for various requests (DescribeSensor, GetObservation, InsertObservation,
    etc.). Fig. 1 shows the integration of all sensor observations into SOS relational
    database. 2.2.1.4. Sensor event service (SES) The SES provides the user an interface
    to access sensor data and measurements (Chandy and Schulte, 2007, Echterhoff and
    Ingo, 2010). The SES facilitates user to subscribe for the particular sensor or
    set threshold value/s and enable notifications about selected phenomenon (e.g.
    event notifications are triggered on depletion of soil moisture to the set threshold
    i.e. allowable depletion). It also provides methods to dynamically add new sensors
    and send notifications to the service (Fig. 3). Download : Download high-res image

    notification service. 2.2.1.5. Web processing service The WPS interface standard
    provides rules for standardizing how inputs and outputs (requests and responses)
    for geospatial processing services, such as polygon overlay, the daily mean of
    sensor observation time series, etc. The standard also defines how a client can
    request the execution of a process, and how the output from the process is handled
    (Mueller and Pross, 2015). Fig. 1 shows the core WPS requests i.e. GetCapabilities,
    DescribeProcess, and ExecuteProcess. The GetCapabilities request provides information
    about available processes (e.g. a process to estimate root-zone soil moisture
    storage based on soil moisture sensor observations). The DescribeProcess provides
    details about selected process. For example, the process for estimation of root-zone
    soil moisture storage requires, input (i.e. time series observations from soil
    moisture in date and float data type) and output (i.e. estimated soil moisture
    storage time series of date and float data type) parameters. The ExecuteProcess
    handles actual computation defined by process and output results are provided
    in response. The detailed description of each component of SWE layer is described
    in subsequent section. 2.2.2. Architecture of SWE layer The Architecture of SWE
    layer comprises of, an SWE web services module (e.g. Sensor Observation Service
    version 1.0) for data query and access, Sensor Alerts and Notification (e.g. Sensor
    Event Notification Service) based on pre-defined parameter thresholds and rules
    and Sensor data archival module. These various components run in parallel with
    the supporting functionalities (Fig. 1) as discussed below: SWE Web services module
    maps the details about each sensing system using Sensor ML. The O&M standards
    are used for encoding the observations (e.g. observed values, observed property,
    references to feature and procedure, time stamps, etc.). For example in case of
    air temperature sensor, O&M standards are used to represent parameters such as
    observed values (i.e. actual sensor observations), observed property (i.e. identification
    of observed property air temperature), feature of interest and procedure (i.e.
    identification of associated feature with procedure), time stamp (i.e. time at
    which observation is collected), and offerings. The user interactions are handled
    through SOS requests such as GetCapabilities, DescribeSensor, and GetObservation
    (Fig. 4). Download : Download high-res image (530KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 4. Sequence diagram representing interactions among various components
    of sensor web enabled service platform. The SOS GetObservation request specifies
    the sensor offering (i.e. sensor system), O&M sampling time, observed property
    and response format (Fig. 5a). The GetObservation response returns the location
    of the feature of interest (i.e. sensor) and observation collection for specified
    time interval (Fig. 5b). Details about Sensor Alerts and Notification are discussed
    in subsequent section. Download : Download high-res image (171KB) Download : Download

    high-res image (383KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5b. Snippet of
    SOS GetObservation response. Sensor Alerts and Notification provides capabilities
    to report the sensor observations over email, social network site such as Twitter
    (2016). The main advantages of this functionality are (a) observations from sensing
    system are available on user''s social web page/account without maintaining a
    separate database on cloud service and (b) as observations are directly posted/updated
    on social media the latency in information dissemination are significantly reduced.
    The critical information about events such as sudden increase in temperature,
    and drop in relative humidity below a certain level can be effectively notified
    to the user''s/stakeholders thereby ensuring the initiation of quick response
    for mitigation of effects of these events. Social network tweet capability is
    configured to one hour in sensing system (Fig. 4). In future, the event notification
    service can be improved by incorporating the OGC publish/subscribe interface standard
    (Braeckel et al., 2016). The data from heterogeneous sensing systems is collected
    and organized in SOS complaint format by sensor data polling process. To continuously
    update the state of service the data polling process executes SOS request GetCapabilities
    and InsertObservation. As internet connectivity (GSM/GPRS network) at the test
    site (remote villages) widely varies, the process of sensor data polling is independently
    maintained, which ensures communication with all remote sensor systems. The data
    polling frequency can be configured to any duration, and it has been set to one
    hour in the present study. The size of text data transferred per sensing system
    during each polling event ranges between 1 and 1.5 kilobytes (Fig. 4). The request
    specific algorithms required for sensor data processing (e.g. daily minimum and
    maximum temperature calculation, reference evapotranspiration estimation, etc.)
    are maintained using WPS. In this study, existing implementations of the OGC SWE
    and WPS provided by OSGeo community are used (OSGeo, 2017). The OGC SOS standard
    version 1.0 implementation provided by istSOS is used, the architecture is also
    tested with OGC SOS standard version 2.0 (istSOS, 2017). Major differences identified
    between the SOS version 1.0 and 2.0 during preliminary tests of SenseTube interoperable
    sensing and analysis platform are: (a) each observation offering is limited to
    associated with only a single procedure (i.e. one to one constraint). In SenseTube
    platform, multiple procedures (e.g. for temperature sensor associated ADC values
    and observations) were stored as a single offering which caused issues while retrieving
    only the sensor observations. This improved specification for observation offerings
    in SOS 2.0 facilitated identification of correct procedure and removed ambiguity
    in obtaining the observations. (b) The improved specification for temporal and
    spatial filters added in the GetObservation request of SOS 2.0 has facilitated
    the effective retrieval of sensor observations. For example, to estimate reference
    ET for long duration (i.e. quarterly/monthly time interval) would require the
    retrieval of a large number of sensor observations. The updated temporal filters
    in SOS 2.0 enable to divide the request into smaller chunks thereby reducing memory
    overloads. The spatial filters are used to identify the nearest AWS and SenseTube
    observations to validate the observed and model estimated soil moisture and temperature.
    (c) In SOS 2.0, the response format conversion (serialization) is loosely coupled
    and can be moved from server side to client side; this helps in reducing processing
    overhead. In the long-term deployment with very high sensor sampling frequency
    this improved specification would help in reducing the energy footprint of SenseTube
    sensing and analysis platform. The OGC WPS version 2.0 implementation PyWPS 4.0
    is used (PyWPS, 2017). The SOS and WPS implementations are selected mainly because
    of lightweight Python based implementation on single board computer. The proposed
    methodology provides the on-board implementation of SWE and attempts towards independent
    hardware or software implementation. The web/mobile user interacts with SWE layer
    through SOS and WPS requests handled by the interoperable thin client. The detailed
    explanation about a web based client and SWE service platform is discussed in
    subsequent section. 2.3. Web based visualization layer A web based thin client
    has been designed to establish seamless communication between the SWE processes
    and user/stakeholder. In this study thin client has been designed for user e.g.
    farmer, researcher, etc. The OGC specified standards such as SOS, WPS and third
    party Web Map Service (WMS) are the primary access point of the web based thin
    client. The service architecture can also facilitate machine to machine interaction
    through process sharing and seamless data access (this study do not cover the
    details about machine to machine communication). Designed thin client acts as
    a gateway interface to the SWE architecture, and it hides the complexities of
    sensing systems from the end user (Fig. 6). Download : Download high-res image

    (a) Details about sensing system and SOS capabilities, (b) and (c) Sensor observations
    in chart and table format and (d) Sensor observations overlaid on third party
    WMS layer. Fig. 6 shows snapshots of modules of web based thin client, (1) details
    about sensing system and capabilities, (2) sensor observations in a chart and
    table format, and (3) sensor observations over third party WMS layer (e.g. Open
    Street Map, Google Map, Bing Map, etc.). The client is interoperable with any
    SOS, WPS based sensing system. The first module provides basic information about
    service platform facilitating the details about geographic location, manufacturer,
    the number of sensors on sensing system, etc. (Fig. 6a). This information leads
    to the further query about details of each procedure and identifies the exact
    feature of interest e.g. air temperature, relative humidity, etc. Also, it provides
    details about each observed property and its associated sensor lineage e.g. minimum/maximum
    range, observed property, time of first and recent observation insert into SOS,
    etc. The sensor data access and visualization are important for any sensing system,
    particularly to the novice farming community. Sensor data observation module of
    the interoperable client comprises filter (e.g. date, time, sensor id, etc.) based
    sensor data querying mechanism. The user can select any sensor from selected sensing
    system and visualize the observations in table and chart format, and also facilitate
    the sensor data download in comma separated variable (CSV) format (Fig. 6b and
    c). The sensor observations are overlaid on third party WMS layer to understand
    the geospatial location and details of observed phenomenon (Fig. 6d). We have
    designed a web based thin client (i.e. interoperable web client) in PHP and Python
    programming language and it''s available for download on GitHub URL''s https://github.com/suryakant54321/sos-client-in-php
    and https://github.com/suryakant54321/Python-SOS-Client. A case study on agro-meteorological
    monitoring and potential evapotranspiration estimation have been discussed below
    to understand the need and utility of interoperable sensing systems. 3. A case
    study on application of SOA for citrus crop water requirement estimation A major
    Citrus (Orange/Mandarin) growing region in the semi-arid tropical region was selected
    to demonstrate the need and utility of SWE in agriculture. The details about study
    area, deployment of interoperable sensing system and estimation of agro-meteorological
    parameters are described in subsequent section. 3.1. Study area and field deployment
    of sensing system Vidarbha region of Maharashtra, India experiences severe climatic
    uncertainties (uneven rainfall and severe heat) thereby giving rise to crop failure.
    The area receives rainfall during southwest monsoon. The average annual rainfall
    ranges between 700 and 800 mm. The maximum temperature during summer recorded
    up to 46 °C while the minimum temperature during winter drops to about 5 °C (GSDA,
    2016). Wheat and Gram are major irrigated crops; Cotton, Jowar (Sorghum) and Toor
    (Pigeon Pea) are major non-irrigated crops; Orange, Cotton, and Groundnut are
    major cash crops cultivated in the region. The harvesting of Orange takes place
    in two fruiting seasons Ambiya (November-December) and Mrig (February-March).
    As per ground water resource estimates, Warud is categorized as one of the three
    over-exploited groundwater resources regions (tahsils) of Amravati district (CGWB,
    2007). The main reasons for selection of this study area to study the prospects
    of Sensor Web Enablement for irrigation management in agriculture are (a) the
    problem of ground water table depletion is more prominent in this region (NRAA,
    2011). (b) the groundwater is a major source of irrigation for Orange cultivation
    of this region and it is adversely affected due to improper irrigation practices
    (NRAA, 2011), (c) Orange crop diseases have a very close relation with poor drainage
    and excess irrigation (Grimm and Timmer, 1981). The soil-borne crop disease infestation
    is caused due to unavailability of right information on stage-wise crop water
    requirement. For initial test deployment of sensing system Orange orchard from
    Nagziri village from Warud tahsil has been selected. The World Meteorological
    Organization (WMO) guidelines for automatic weather station deployment are considered
    for sensor placement in SenseTube sensing system (WMO, 2012). Two each temperature
    and relative humidity sensors are placed at 5 m (above at top of canopy) and 2.5
    m (within the canopy) from ground. Two soil temperature and one soil moisture
    sensors are placed at 15, 30 and 30 cm depth, respectively at a radial distance
    of 5 m from the Orange tree. Remaining ADC channel was closed using pull-down
    resistor (Fig. 7). Download : Download high-res image (212KB) Download : Download

    ease in wire connection and placement of entire module on the base structure.
    The sensor observations are continuously being polled using data polling process
    (Fig. 4) since the date of field deployment (16 Feb. 2014). To monitor the state
    of the sensing system, SES (sensor Twitter feed KrishiSense) has been configured
    to upload two sensor tweets per event. Considering the character restriction of
    a tweet, each event consists of timestamp and value of recorded phenomenon. The
    URL to access sensor system Twitter feed is “https://twitter.com/KrishiSense”.
    3.2. Reference evapotranspiration estimation Widely used reference evapotranspiration
    (ETo) estimation equations i.e. FAO Penman-Monteith (ETo PM) (Allen et al., 1998)
    and Hargreaves (ETo Harg) (Allen et al., 1998) were used in order to understand
    seasonal variation in crop water requirement of orange crop grown and to study
    the feasibility of SenseTube sensing system for field level agro-meteorological
    monitoring and analysis. ETo estimations were performed for both AWS and SenseTube
    weather observations. The equation for estimation of ETo by Penman-Monteith (Allen
    et al., 1998) method is given as, (1) where Δ is slope of saturation vapour pressure
    curve (kPa °C−1), Rn is net radiation at the crop surface (MJ m−2 day−1), G is
    soil heat flux density (MJ m−2 day−1), Ta is mean daily air temperature at 2 m
    height (°C), U2 is wind speed at 2 m height (m/s), es is the saturation vapour
    pressure (kPa), ea is the actual vapour pressure (kPa), (es − ea) is the saturation
    vapour pressure deficit (kPa) and γ is psychrometric constant (kPa °C−1). The
    equation for estimation of ETo by Hargreaves (Allen et al., 1998) method is given
    as, (2) where Tmean mean daily air temperature (°C), Tmax is maximum daily air
    temperature (°C), Tmin is minimum daily air temperature (°C) and Ra is extraterrestrial
    radiation (mm day−1). 4. Results and discussions The agro-meteorological observations
    recorded by SenseTube sensing system during one cropping season of Orange i.e.
    July 2014 to August 2015, locally known as Mrig (July-February) and Ambiya (March-October)
    flowering (locally called bahar), are used for the study. The sampling (for air
    temperature, relative humidity, soil temperature, soil moisture) and polling (data
    update to the remote server) frequency were set to fifteen minutes and one hour,
    respectively. In order to compare the performance of SenseTube sensing system,
    a commercially available Automatic Weather Station (AWS) was set in the study
    area. The AWS has been set up according to World Meteorological Organization (WMO)
    guidelines for automatic weather station installation (WMO, 2012). The spatial
    distance between both sensing systems is less than one kilometer. The daily variations
    in air temperature (°C) at test site are shown in Fig. 8. Ranges of daily minimum
    and maximum temperature at the test bed during the said period were observed to
    be 6.44–34.09 °C and 20.30–46.73 °C, respectively. Download : Download high-res

    by AWS. The composite plot in Fig. 10 shows daily soil temperature observed by
    SenseTube and rainfall events observed by AWS. The soil temperature at 30 cm depth
    varies between 23 °C and 32 °C. It can be observed that there is a steady change
    in soil temperature and rainfall events have very low impact on the change in
    soil temperature at depth of 30 cm. Observed soil temperature shows seasonality
    with the return period of the year which closely resembles with variations in
    surface air temperature. Fig. 11 shows daily volumetric soil moisture at 30 cm
    depth observed by soil moisture sensor mounted on SenseTube. The variations in
    soil moisture are observed to be corresponding rainfall events. The minor variations
    in soil moisture during the absence of rainfall event are caused by irrigation
    events. In selected citrus orchard drip irrigation systems are functional during
    the crop growth period. The volumetric minimum and maximum soil moisture content
    were 12.04% and 48.77%, respectively. Download : Download high-res image (445KB)

    are available, whereas ETo Harg was obtained with AWS and SenseTube system as

    comparison. The results show that for most of the period SenseTube based ETo Harg
    underestimates than ETo PM (Fig. 12). The close vicinity of crop canopy and variations
    in field level relative humidity may have caused overestimates of SenseTube based

    proposed SWE hardware and software architecture has unique features over existing
    implementations. The major advantages of proposed SWE architecture are, • Scalability:
    the proposed sensor web enablement architecture based on heterogeneous sensing
    systems provides the ability to seamlessly connect with multiple sensor nodes.
    • On the fly data processing: dense observations of agro-meteorological parameters
    with seamless data access facilitate important decisions regarding irrigation
    interval and depth. • Distributed computing: design of web enabled client has
    a unique advantage for distributed computing of domain specific environmental
    and crop parameters. With evolving OGC SWE specifications there are few limitations
    in the integrated architecture. Some of the major limitations of proposed SWE
    architecture are, • Scaling up estimates from point to region: the proposed SWE
    architecture needs to be configured with OGC Web Feature Service and Web Coverage
    Service to scale-up actual ET estimates at field level. • Need for sensor plug-n-play:
    significant improvements in analog multi-bus (Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C),
    Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI), RS485, RS232, etc.) sensor hardware connection
    needs to be integrated on sensing system hardware. • Public availability of sensor
    observations: very few public, private organizations are providing sensor observations
    in OGC O&M specifications which impose limitations on the utility of service oriented
    architectures. However, there is need to compare the studies based on SWE for
    precision agriculture. Comparison of available studies based on selected features
    is discussed in subsequent section. 4.2. Comparison between SWE studies Available
    published studies on SWE architectures for precision agriculture application are
    studied based on features proposed by Chen et al. (2015). The proposed features
    of SWE are architecture, sensors supported, data sharing, process sharing, services
    involved, data model, validation and complexity. In this study two additional
    features were identified for comparison of SWE implementation, (1) sensor plug-n-play
    and (2) SWE integration on hardware. The sensor plug-n-play feature describes
    implementation of OGC PUCK Protocol Standard ensuring seamless integration of
    sensors. Feature on SWE integration with hardware was identified to ensure the
    seamless communication between standardized web-enabled hardware platforms (Table
    2). Table 2. Comparison of SWE based architectures. Empty Cell Features Empty

    Murakami et al., 2007, Nash et al., 2009, Nikkilä et al., 2010, Patil et al.,
    2012, Sawant et al., 2012 primarily focus on SWE of existing sensing systems/platforms.
    Whereas, SOA proposed by Liang and Huang, 2013, Geipel et al., 2016, Chen et al.,
    2015, Du et al., 2016 integrate SWE on hardware layer of sensing system/platform.
    The OGC SWE standards are evaluated for their usability and applicability in precision
    agriculture application. The scalability of proposed architecture is facilitated
    by O&M, SensorML and SOS standards. On the fly data processing and distributed
    computing is facilitated by WPS standard. Integrated geospatial information with
    sensor observations facilitates spatio-temporal estimation of the critical agro-meteorological
    parameter. On-board implementation of the SWE framework facilitates ease in acquiring
    processed information at client interface which has potential to extend sensor
    as a service. The large deployment of such SWE based sensing system facilitates
    system identification and reliable access to sensor observations which facilitates
    the hardware maintenance and remote software (i.e. firmware) updates. 5. Conclusions
    With ever increasing capabilities of open source hardware and software tools,
    cost effective IoT based agro-meteorological observation systems can be designed
    for monitoring the weather conditions at very high precision and temporal scale.
    This will facilitate the open field based agricultural research and decision making
    abilities of resource poor farmers in developing countries. Through on-board implementation
    of OGC specified SOS standards the designed sensing system facilitates storage
    and dissemination of sensor observations thereby reducing syntactic heterogeneity
    among sensing systems. The multiple modes (VPN and cloud service) of sensor data
    transfer over the internet ensured the IoT capability of the sensing system. Sensor
    event notification service through social media (Twitter) has shown the effective
    mode of sensor information dissemination to the larger audience. The web based
    interoperable service oriented application client provides better sensor data
    dissemination capabilities thereby facilitating the stakeholders to easily access
    the required sensor observations. The operational field deployment of the sensing
    system in Orange orchard has proved the capabilities of designed SOA. When implemented
    on large scale these distributed interoperable sensing systems can have very wide
    range of applications in solving the regional issues pertaining to the crop-weather-soil
    continuum. The study has been initiated to collect soil moisture observations
    from multiple depths and locations for validation of proposed modeling approach
    for field scale irrigation scheduling of Orange crop. It has been envisaged to
    integrate OGC specified Sensor Planning Service on sensing platform for effective
    in-situ data processing for better decision making. Attempts are being made towards
    deployment of multiple sensing systems for agro-meteorological data collection
    for precision water management in the horticultural crop (Orange) of the semi-arid
    tropical region of Maharashtra India. Acknowledgements This is a part of research

    Get rights and content Abstract Science-based, holistic, site-specific water conservation
    practices can reduce water use on turfgrass sites without adversely affecting
    turfgrass performance. However, when water use is decreased below a certain threshold,
    performance declines. Water conservation measures that reduce turfgrass performance
    essentially decrease its economic, environmental, recreational, and aesthetic
    values, which can in turn adversely impact many ‘stakeholders’, including the
    local economy and those affected by increased wind erosion, water erosion, or
    fire hazard. On larger turfgrass sites, considerable costs are associated with
    some water conservation strategies, especially when the quality of an alternative
    irrigation water source is poor or redesign of the landscape and/or irrigation
    system is involved. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords TurfgrassDrought

    management 1. The question The question “Can we maintain turf to customers’ satisfaction
    with less water?” suggests several points: (a) That less water can be used on
    turf sites in many situations. (b) That turf performance or quality could potentially
    be affected in a manner that would reduce its value to the customer. (c) There
    are ‘customers’ who derive benefits from turfgrass. (d) The issue of water conservation
    as a ‘benefit’ should be addressed in the context of other changes (environmental,
    economic, recreational, etc.) that may be ‘costs’ to customers. In the midst of
    a water crisis, the general public, politicians, and water regulatory agencies
    may focus only on water savings that can be achieved by implementing immediate
    water saving measures without regard to potential short or long term consequences
    to all that may be affected. However, if water conservation measures are severe
    enough to compromise turf recreational use, economic impact, environmental/functional
    benefits, or aesthetics, then more than the perceived direct ‘customer’ may be
    adversely affected (Beard and Green, 1994, Gibeault, 2002, Cathy, 2003). The focus
    of this paper is to address the points posed by the question in the title. 2.
    Sound water conservation strategies can result in less water used on turf sites
    In recent papers (Balogh and Watson, 1992, Ervin and Koski, 1998, Richie et al.,
    2002, Bastug and Buyuktas, 2003), the relationships between turfgrass evapotranspiration
    (ETc) and turf quality were explored along with the discussion of past research
    as reviewed by Kneebone et al. (1992) and Kenna and Horst (1993). Several conclusions
    can be reached based on the various studies relating ETc versus turf performance:
    (1) In general, the landscape coefficients (KL), for cool-season grasses (0.70–0.95)
    are higher than for warm-season turfgrasses (0.65–0.85) when the irrigation regime
    is at 3–7+ days between events, which would allow moisture stress within the surface
    zone. At these KL values, the turf could maintain acceptable quality and growth,
    but as the KL value was decreased below these general ranges using a similar irrigation
    schedule, turf performance rapidly declined (Meyer and Gibeault, 1987, Carrow,
    1995). (2) Irrigation scheduling can influence the KL value versus turf performance.
    When a grass was irrigated more heavily (KL 0.75–1.00 for tall fescue, Festuca
    arundinacea Shreb., 7 day schedule), the irrigation frequency could be extended;
    but with a 2–3 day schedule, a KL of 0.50 maintained good quality (Richie et al.,
    2002). The concept of deep, infrequent irrigation scheduling is limited by the
    surface drying versus turf performance relationship, especially in arid regions.
    In arid regions, where most water addition is by irrigation, it is important to
    determine the deepest and least frequent irrigation schedule that will allow maximum
    water conservation without an unacceptable decline in turf quality resulting from
    too severe drying at the surface (Brede, 2000). Extending the irrigation interval
    too long will result in more water application to maintain the same turf quality
    level compared to a less frequent irrigation using less water. In a semi-arid
    or humid climate, deep rooting is important to take advantage of natural precipitation
    events. However, in an arid climate, rooting to a depth that allows a reasonable
    interval between irrigation events without excessive surface drying is all that
    is needed and not the deepest rooted grass. (3) Carrow (1995) reported turfgrass
    ETc was 40–60% less in a humid environment compared to the same cultivar grown
    in an arid environment, but similar KL values were reported for both. ETo under
    the humid climate was less, accounting for the differences in observed ETc. Additionally,
    irrigation intervals in arid or semi-arid climates were normally within the range
    of 3–7 days, but Carrow (1996) reported irrigation frequencies of 5–20 days due
    to lower ETc, allowing more opportunity to capture natural precipitation rather
    than to irrigate. (4) If a daily irrigation regime was followed, KL for cool-season
    grasses is reported to be 0.88–1.09 (Aronson et al., 1987, Bastug and Buyuktas,
    2003). Thus, allowing no drought stress on the turfgrass can result in high ETc.
    Dormant turf would be expected have only evaporation losses. (5) Within the broad
    categories of cool and warm-season grasses, species differences are apparent.
    (6) Within a species, there can be 20–60% range in ETc (Kjelgren et al., 2000).
    Thus, controlled research studies confirm that water conservation can be achieved
    to a point before turfgrass quality starts to decline; thereafter, decreasing
    water results in reduced turf quality. The resulting reduction in turf quality
    or cover implies a potential for reduction in recreational use, environmental/functional
    capabilities, and economic use/value of the site, which in turn may adversely
    affect the direct customer, owners, local economy, and local environment (Beard
    and Green, 1994, Cathy, 2003). The real issue then becomes how to maximize water
    conservation on turfgrass areas while maintaining economic viability. Be science-based:
    Water conservation measures are increasingly becoming incorporated into regulatory
    policy. However, it is essential that policy arising out of the political process
    be based on science and not political decision devoid of sound science. When incorporating
    science-based concepts into a water conservation program, it is important that
    it is true science and not pseudo-science where opinion is cloaked in scientific
    language. A science-based approach stimulates entrepreneurship to develop improved
    technology to enhance future water use-efficiency. Holistic in terms of water
    conservation options: There is no ‘silver-bullet’ or single factor to achieve
    water conservation, rather a combination of water conservation strategies is needed
    to achieve high water-use efficiency in the whole system. The system includes
    soil, plant/landscape, atmosphere, turf manager, irrigation system, irrigation
    source, cultural practices, and any other aspect that may influence water-use.
    Holistic in terms of consideration of the effects of water conservation measures
    on all stakeholders as a central component of all water conservation plans: Water
    conservation programs should include consideration of the effects on the economy,
    environment, jobs, and site use. The customer or user/manager/owner of a turf
    site is not the only stakeholder potentially affected by water conservation measures,
    but others include: the supply side (water authorities, suppliers); demand side
    (homeowner, turf manager, turf industry, etc.); and others affected by environmental
    and economic water conservation measures (society in general, local economy, health
    aspects, etc.). 3. Assessing the benefits and costs of water conservation programs
    Vickers (2001) noted key steps to a successful water conservation program on a
    regional or state-wide basis as: (a) identify conservation goals; (b) develop
    a water-use profile and forecast; (c) evaluate planned facilities; (d) identify
    and evaluate conservation measures; (e) identify and assess conservation incentives;
    (f) analyze benefits and costs; (g) select conservation measures and incentives;
    (h) prepare and implement the conservation plan; (i) integrate conservation and
    supply plans, modify forecasts; and (j) monitor, evaluate, and revise program
    as needed. Specific best management practices (BMPs), however, that can be applied
    on a site-specific basis on a turfgrass facility are essential. There are a number
    of components or strategies that should be integrated into an overall turfgrass
    BMPs water conservation plan, at the site-specific level (Gibeault and Cockerham,
    1985, Carrow and Duncan, 2000a, Carrow et al., 2002a, Carrow et al., 2002b). Within
    each broad strategy there are numerous options to consider when selecting the
    water conservation BMPs most appropriate for a particular site. However, except
    for the water audit approach, which deals only with the irrigation system, comprehensive,
    in-depth plans have not been available to turf managers (Irrigation Association,
    2003a). Recently, Carrow et al. (2005), in conjunction with the Golf Course Superintendents
    Association of America, developed a comprehensive, water conservation BMPs document
    (template) for individual golf courses dealing with: the planning process; detailed
    options for different water conservation strategies; and information on benefit/cost
    assessment. Components of a site-specific water conservation program for golf
    courses are denoted in Table 1. Their BMP template model is currently being considered
    by two states in the USA as a model for state water conservation plans related
    to the golf course industry in contrast to rigid regulations, such as a set quantity
    of water or specific days and times of irrigation. Table 1. Components of site-specific

    and costs of water conservation measures on all stakeholders  Benefits   Direct
    and indirect to the owner/manager and site customers   Direct and indirect to
    other stakeholders, including water savings but also other benefits—society, economic,

    water conservation strategies, irrigation system changes; water storage; pumping;
    new maintenance equipment; water/soil treatments; course design alterations; etc.   Labor
    needs/costs   Costs associated with changes in maintenance practices; different
    irrigation water sources (water treatment, soil treatment, storage, etc.)   Costs
    that may impact the community if water conservation strategies are implemented
    (especially mandated ones), such as revenue loss, job loss, etc. Assessment of
    benefits and costs of implementing water conservation measures on all stakeholders
    is essential to understand implications. The immediate owner or manager of a turf
    site will naturally assess the direct costs involved to implement water conservation
    measures. For the homeowner, rebate or water cost incentives may help offset the
    cost of landscape design and plant material changes, irrigation system alterations,
    and rain sensors (WRA, 2003). For large scale facilities, such as a golf course,
    the implementation costs may be considerable for changes in landscape design/plant
    material, irrigation system design and operation, using alternative irrigation
    water resources (i.e., wastewater piping costs, water/soil amendments), more frequent
    cultivation, training, and monitoring. Vickers (2001) and WRA (2003) provide much
    discussion on direct and indirect benefits of reducing water consumption, but
    limited discussion concerning potential for adverse effects to: (a) facility costs
    to implement changes required by a plan, and (b) some potential adverse environmental
    impacts if overuse of water on turf resulted in adverse in-stream flow, over-pumping
    of groundwater, reduced wetland effects, and one mention of fire hazard from native
    grasses. In contrast, Cathy (2003), Beard and Green (1994), and Gibeault (2002)
    note a broad array of benefits that turfgrass and the turf industry contribute
    to society (Table 2), and present a good discussion with case studies of adverse
    effects when water conservation measures are taken to the extreme, especially
    without consideration of other environmental impacts. Table 2. Benefits that turfgrass
    sites contribute (after Beard and Green, 1994, Cathy, 2003, Gibeault, 2002) Functional/environmental  Prevent
    soil loss from wind erosion—a primary reason turf is used as a groundcover.  Reduce
    air borne dust  Protect for soil loss by water erosion—a primary reason turf is

    reason turf is used as a groundcover.  Capture water from runoff for soil moisture

    on sports fields and turf areas used for enjoyment  Entrapment of organic chemical

    compliment to trees, shrubs, and flowers  Allows individuals to express themselves
    and influence their surroundings through individualized landscape Economic  Direct
    revenues, taxes, jobs from sports events and golfing in the local economy  Enhancement
    of tourism—in some cases tourism is build around golfing  Parks, sports venues,
    golf courses, and landscape industry contribute jobs, money and taxes  Suppliers
    of turfgrass equipment, supplies, and services contribute jobs, money, and taxes
    in the economy  Enhanced home and properties values and, therefore, greater tax
    revenues  Contributes to purchase of non-turf items goods and services in the
    community—restaurants, dry cleaners, service stations, etc. As noted earlier,
    careful application of water conservation strategies can reduce turfgrass water
    use, but after a point turfgrass performance and associated benefits will start
    to decline. Therefore, as a part of an overall water conservation plan, actual
    water conservation/savings must be balanced by potential effects that may arise
    (i.e., economic, functional/environmental, recreational use of the site, and aesthetics)
    not just on the specific site, but also on the local and broad economy and environment.
    Two examples illustrate the effect when removal of turf is carried too far: •
    When China removed all turf and many trees from Beijing public spaces during the
    Cultural Revolution in the 1960s, the result was major air pollution from dust
    storms, related health problems, and higher air temperatures within the city (Cathy,
    2003). Revegetation with trees alone did not resolve the problem but required
    turfgrass cover. Recently, the People''s Daily (2000) reported “Beijing will take
    drastic moves to eliminate the sources of dust so as to reduce the amount of dust
    people breathe in everyday … worksites that refuse to plant trees shall be taken
    back … and shall be turned into lawns put under the management of gardening departments”.
    • Mowed turfgrass can be an effective fire buffer and replacement near homes can
    result in fire hazard and higher homeowner insurance. ‘Firewise’ landscaping for
    the wildland-urban interface suggests that zone 1 (9 m ring around home); and
    zone 2 be well-irrigated, low growing, and low flammability species; zone 3 to
    low-growing plants and well-spaced trees in this area, with low volume of vegetation
    for fuel (Firewise, 2004). 4. Site-specific turfgrass water conservation strategies
    Several potential water conservation strategies with options can be used in BMPs
    for a turfgrass site (Table 1) (Carrow et al., 2005): 4.1. Use of non-potable
    water sources for irrigation-alternative water sources, water harvesting/reuse
    An important strategy for water conservation is to use alternative non-potable
    water sources, such as runoff collected in ponds, effluent (wastewater), poor
    quality ground water, seawater or seawater/blends (Carrow and Duncan, 2000b).
    As recreational areas shift to poorer water quality, more salt-induced problems
    are anticipated that will require extra alternative irrigation water beyond the
    normal irrigation rate for salt leaching. Monitoring of soil moisture and salt
    levels at multiple depths will become more commonplace by mobile and/or installed
    moisture and salt sensors. The necessity of using grasses with higher salt tolerance
    will alter management not only because the grass is new, but because salt-induced
    problems must be managed (Carrow and Duncan, 1998). The environmentally friendly
    term ‘water harvesting’ is not often used in relation to golf courses or other
    turf sites, yet it is a common practice (Florkowski and Landry, 2002). Many golf
    course irrigation lakes also serve as landscaping features and catch excess runoff,
    preventing the loss of substantial amounts of water from the site and preventing
    sediment into streams or rivers. Catchment features are usually part of an overall
    stormwater control and reuse plan mandated by governmental policies. A recent
    survey of Georgia golf courses indicated that as much as 67% of irrigation water
    came from such non-potable, runoff lakes (Florkowski and Landry, 2002). Water
    harvesting is usually thought of as treating watersheds to enhance runoff collected
    for future use (Thomas et al., 1997, Todd and Vittori, 1997, Waterfall, 1998).
    In the case of golf courses, the landscape is purposely contoured to collect the
    excess runoff from rainfall, while allowing good infiltration of water into the
    soil under normal conditions. Some golf courses with large adjacent housing developments
    are investigating the potential for collecting drainage and runoff from these
    areas, using their own facility to treat the non-potable water to standards acceptable
    for turf use, and irrigating the golf course with the water. This practice saves
    local government the expense of treating the water. 4.2. Selection of turfgrass
    species/cultivars and landscape plants for water conservation Development and
    use of turfgrasses with superior drought resistance/low water use is a primary
    means of decreasing water needs on turfgrass sites (Kenna and Horst, 1993). Cynodon
    spp. are widely used in warm-season zones and most cultivars exhibit superior
    drought resistance; but superior drought resistance in many other commonly used
    species, especially cool-season grasses, is less evident, and will remain so until
    breeders focus on this as a priority. Some turfgrass breeders are now placing
    more emphasis on drought resistance, particularly the most important component
    which is drought avoidance via a greater genetic-based root tolerance to soil
    stresses that limit root development/maintenance and by shoot characteristics
    that contribute to an inherent low water use (Duncan and Carrow, 1999). Under
    more limited irrigation regimes, other stresses besides drought are enhanced and
    will require attention by breeders and turf managers, namely; high temperature
    tolerance for cool-season grasses, wear tolerance, salinity tolerance in the case
    where poor water quality is used, and pests that are favored by reduced growth
    rates. In addition to assessing and developing drought resistant cultivars among
    traditional species, non-traditional species bred for superior drought resistance
    and/or other stress resistance traits will become more commonplace (Brede, 2000,
    Duncan and Carrow, 2001, Loch et al., 2003). 4.3. Landscape design for water conservation
    On homesites, ‘Xeriscape’ principles are often promoted as water conserving. Interestingly,
    Vickers (2001) noted that ‘beyond Xeriscape’ is a move to an all natural landscape.
    Behind this movement appears to be groups that promote only native plants as appropriate
    for the natural landscape and use water conservation as the environmental reason,
    but without a balance of what other adverse human and ecological environmental
    effects may result, fire hazard, dust hazard, etc., or what about the non-native
    garden and food crop plants? However, Welch (2003) states that as the original
    “Xeriscape concept matured and spread, the principle of limited turf use was increasingly
    scrutinized by horticulturists and turf experts. Today''s Xeriscape movement incorporates
    a more holistic approach to reducing turf irrigation … through the principles
    of Xeriscape, turf irrigation can be reduced while the many benefits of turfgrass
    can still be derived … many turfgrasses are drought-tolerant and can survive extreme
    drought conditions”. These contrasting views illustrate that all ‘Xeriscape landscape
    design’ concepts are not equal, which one is used for water conservation purposes
    has a dramatic effect on the potential for environmental and human hazards. Landscape
    design focus must not be one-dimensional by focusing on minimizing the turf area,
    but must apply all of the Xeriscape principles (Cathy, 2003) of planning and design,
    soil improvement, appropriate plant selection, practical turf areas, efficient
    irrigation design and scheduling (including the human factor), mulching, and appropriate
    maintenance. Additionally, any adverse environmental effects of proposed landscaping
    changes should be considered, namely, wind erosion/dust, water erosion/sedimentation
    of water features, fire hazard, etc. On larger, more complex sites, such as golf
    courses, prior to construction or renovation, many decisions can be made that
    will foster water conservation or greatly limit it, such as grass choices, irrigation
    system design/piping and zoning, contouring, and area of well-irrigated turf on
    the site. Numerous design looks can be achieved with mulch materials; use of alternative,
    drought-resistant grasses that are left unmowed in non-landing areas; incorporation
    of native low growing ground covers, shrubs, and trees that require minimal irrigation
    and possess unique looks; using higher mowing heights on parts of the fairway
    or adjacent roughs that may receive little or limited irrigation; utilization
    of features, such as rock, sand bunkers, and non-irrigated mounds. Golfers seem
    to accept brown turf when it is mowed high or left unmowed, but may not accept
    as much discoloration or lower plant density on the closely mowed high-use areas.
    Since golf courses must compete for local and, in some locations, national and
    international customers, the visual aspects on the close-mowed playing area influences
    play and the associated tourist industry, i.e., Asian golfers may not come to
    the Australian Gold Coast if it does not have competitive quality to alternative
    golf locations. In other instances with less play demand and competition for customers,
    dormant, semi-dormant, or lower quality turf may be very acceptable on large expanses
    of many golf courses. Irrigation level on the high use areas also influences the
    degree of traffic that a golf course or recreational field can tolerate. Contouring
    is another important design factor, especially avoiding excessive slopes, mounds,
    and berms that are difficult to irrigate even with an excellent irrigation system.
    Also, contouring should foster water harvesting. 4.4. Efficient irrigation system
    design Irrigation system design and irrigation scheduling (see Section 4.5) are
    essential for water conservation on irrigated sites. One critical design challenge
    is to deal with spatial variability, which can be very complex on turf sites with
    many microclimates resulting from the diverse terrain, soil, and plants (Table
    3). Spatial variability must be determined, and adjustments made through landscape
    design, irrigation system design, and site-specific irrigation scheduling. Even
    a home landscape can be much more variable than most agricultural fields and golf
    course sites are very complex in terms of variability. Specific types of variability
    (Table 3) must be individually identified and quantified. This is an area that
    the author believes will receive more attention in the future so that more precise
    design of irrigation systems and their operation can be achieved, while also maximizing
    sensor placement. Table 3. Spatial variability that influences irrigation scheduling
    and water-use efficiency Above-ground—variability across the landscape due to:  Climate
    variation   Solar radiation (N/S exposure, shade)   Wind speed   Humidity   Air
    temperatures  Grass/plant type and characteristics—canopy structure, mowing height,
    growth rate, etc. Soil variability—both horizontally and vertically due to:  Soil
    texture  OM content  Soil depth  Slope  Soil water holding capacity  Infiltration  Salinity  pH,
    fertility, etc.  Irrigation system—good design, zoning, and hardware reduces landscape
    and soil variability but when the system is not properly designed or operated
    it becomes another source of variability. In recent years, as water conservation
    has become a looming reality, there has been a marked increase in entrepreneurial
    activity to improve irrigation design and scheduling aspects through better hardware,
    develop software to communicate between controllers and sensors, and improved
    irrigation concepts. The author''s current research is focused on identification
    and characterization of variability of landscapes and soils; categorizing similar
    microclimates; and using sensor technology to integrate real-time information
    by microclimate type into irrigation scheduling by combinations of atmospheric
    and soil-based means. Within agriculture, the equivalent of incorporating these
    issues would be the precision agriculture or integrated approach to irrigation
    management described by Buss (1996). Irrigation system design is an important
    component of water conservation on turfgrass sites in order: (a) to apply water
    in an efficient manner so as to limit water losses by runoff, leaching past root
    systems, or unnecessary evaporation from water standing on the surface; (b) to
    allow adequate irrigation of areas as needed within the time constraints imposed
    by night time irrigation, salt leaching, water control authorities, etc.; and
    (c) to make site-specific or precision water applications accurately on individual,
    microclimate areas, according to their needs. In this latter aspect, control of
    water application on a site-specific basic will often include control of the water
    rate and depth of percolation for maintaining root viability; and on areas with
    poor water quality to insure salt movement downward, while preventing capillary
    rise back into the root zone. Many of the fundamentals of good irrigation design
    are known and have been applied to a certain extent, especially in more arid and
    semi-arid locations (Irrigation Association, 2003a, Irrigation Association, 2003b).
    However, for maximum water use-efficiency, full incorporation of these principles
    must be “the norm” for the next generation of irrigation systems and renovations
    of existing systems. Water must be applied on a precision basis in a BMPs water
    conservation plan—and this cannot be accomplished with a poorly designed irrigation
    system. Highly automated irrigation systems will initially cost more, but in the
    long term save water/money and allow true implementation of environmental stewardship
    principles by the turf facility. 4.5. Improved irrigation scheduling Irrigated
    sites can be over-watered because people do not irrigate according to plant needs,
    including Xeriscapes. In Phoenix, Xeriscapes actually used 30% more water than
    conventional landscapes. This illustrates the critical point that it is people
    who over-irrigate (Vickers, 2001). Means must be developed to couple irrigation
    applications to true plant water needs. The best designed irrigation system will
    not efficiently apply water unless it is properly programmed. Irrigation scheduling
    is normally by experience of the turf manager using indicator spots or problem
    areas where drought symptoms are first observed to aid in deciding when to irrigate.
    Many golf courses and some other turf sites have an on-site weather station where
    estimated ETo data is available; but ETo data must be adjusted for each microclimate
    site, since grass, soil type, radiation, wind, and other environmental or management
    conditions will differ from the weather station site. For example, each microclimate
    adjustment is made by multiplying a landscape coefficient (KL) by the ETo to obtain
    an estimated turf ET (ETc). Unfortunately, the KL factor differs with grass, season,
    weather front, and microclimate soil/atmospheric conditions, while the ETo does
    not take into account the soil (current soil moisture level by depth) nor plant
    (depth of viable root system, current level of stress) conditions. Irrigation
    scheduling of the future will involve real-time information from within an irrigation
    zone to provide more site-specific guidance (Sudduth et al., 1999). One approach
    will be soil sensors that are now capable of monitoring soil moisture in 50–100
    mm zones at multiple depths down to 1 m in a real-time mode with remote transfer
    of the data for ease of use (Charlesworth, 2000, Moller et al., 1996). Precision
    application of irrigation for prevention of moisture stress and for salt control,
    requires precise information on current conditions by soil depth. A common question
    that arises with soil moisture sensors is whether a soil measurement represents
    the area due to spatial variability across a landscape and within the soil. Comments
    related to this question are: • For any means of irrigation scheduling to be efficient,
    adjustments must be made for the microclimate site. Soil sensors offer the capability
    for being the most site-specific moisture monitoring approach within the vertical
    plane throughout the root zone. However, microclimate site assessment must be
    more stringent than is practiced in a current water audit (Irrigation Association,
    2003a) and must be quantified so that: (a) zoning can be more specific; (b) sensors
    can be accurately placed; (c) similar microclimates can be classed together so
    that one representative site can be used as an indicator for other similar sites;
    and (d) so KL values can be daily adjusted via soil sensor and atmospheric sensor
    (such as in shaded areas) data by adjustment of weather station ETo for actual
    microclimate water use. • New sensors and software have greater capabilities than
    many now visualize when they think of a soil sensor. They offer real-time data,
    multiple depth moisture readings, translation of the information into useful formats
    with appropriate software, and the ability to electronically transfer data to
    remote sites. These attributes can be useful for documenting the need to irrigate
    a site and maintaining a history of soil moisture statue. • Soil sensor placement
    must be done carefully to represent the diverse characteristics of the area. Their
    installation must follow the guidelines to make sure good soil-to-sensor contact
    exists and calibration must be accurate, but these issues can be addressed. •
    As noted, soil sensors are only effective when they are used within a carefully
    zoned irrigation system that has a high uniformity of water application or a system
    with the ability to control water delivery to specific parts of a zone (Buss,
    1996). Then, sufficient sensors must be placed to represent a microclimate zone,
    but one such zone may then represent several other similar ones. • It is the difference
    in water content between readings that is important and not absolute moisture
    content information, because the difference is an actual measure of water used
    and it indicates where the water was extracted within the root zone. There is
    less spatial variability in the difference data than within an absolute value
    when comparing across several sensors. Another emerging technology is the use
    of plant-based monitoring of plant stress in irrigation scheduling using precision
    agriculture concepts (Frazier et al., 1999). Currently, the most effort is in
    measuring light reflectance from the turf canopy within the 350–1100 nm wavelength
    region, which includes the visible/PAR (photosynthetically active radiation) region
    of 400–750 nm (Geuertal et al., 2000). Loss of color and/or leaf area can increase
    reflectance within certain wavelengths that may be used in models to estimate
    overall plant stress, irrigation need, or perhaps a nutrient stress. For example,
    Jiang and Carrow (2005) investigated turf quality and leaf firing responses versus
    narrow-band reflectance in the 400–1100 nm region under progressive drought stress
    for five turfgrass species and several cultivars within species. Models based
    on narrow-band reflectance data to predict drought stress differed with species
    and for cultivars within a species; and models exhibited coefficients of determination
    (R2) of only 0.40–0.60 (Jiang and Carrow, 2005). Other approaches may become possible,
    such as using a wider wavelength range of 350–2500 nm where several ‘water bands’
    occur, use of the infrared thermal region of 8000–14,000 nm, fluorescence reflectance,
    digital imaging data, and others. However, even with an accurate plant-based method,
    the question of how much water to apply is still a major problem. 4.6. Altering
    management practices to enhance water-use efficiency Various management practices
    can substantially affect water-use efficiency, especially practices that maximize
    water infiltration and turfgrass root development and maintenance (Carrow, 1994).
    Cultural operations may alter the soil conditions to reduce water loss from runoff,
    leaching or excess evaporation and to improve soil water retention. Although a
    particular turfgrass may have the genetic potential to be drought resistant, without
    proper management, it may exhibit low water-use efficiency. 4.7. Education Educational
    efforts will be needed for policy makers, water management authorities turfgrass
    managers, turf students, facility officials and members and crew members who are
    concerned with water conservation and management on turfgrass areas. The challenge
    for extension specialists and research scientists will be to produce in-depth
    information packages containing both scientific principles and specific practices
    for turf managers and consultants in the industry (Carrow et al., 2001). Turf
    mangers will be more likely to embrace new technology if they have ready access
    to good educational opportunities from well-trained consultants and specialists.
    4.8. Water conservation and contingency plans A water conservation plan conserves
    water on a continuous basis, whereas a contingency plan deals with water-conserving
    measures during severe water shortages. At the turfgrass facility level, it is
    essential that owners, members and officials assist in formulating these plans,
    understand their implications, and adopt the plans. Facility policies must include
    water conservation. 4.9. Other water conservation practices In addition to the
    practices already outlined, other practices include: (a) monitoring a water conservation
    program to assess success by documenting water use (for example, by water meters)
    and relating it to turfgrass performance, (b) periodic site water audits can identify
    leaks, irrigation head malfunctions, design limitations, irrigation scheduling
    problems or other wasteful water use, and (c) indoor water conservation plans
    for any buildings on a facility (Vickers, 2001). 5. Challenges to water conservation
    Considerable information exists about many aspects of turfgrass water conservation
    practices, which could be implemented rapidly to achieve water savings on most
    sites. Incorporating new developments in grasses, technology, concepts, and scientific
    knowledge would produce additional water savings over time. Many turfgrass managers
    already follow some water conservation practices at their sites, but full implementation
    is often hindered by certain challenges: • Agronomic—the current turfgrass on
    a site may not be very well adapted or drought resistant. • Educational—managing
    for water conservation requires a whole systems approach by the turf manager and
    it is a complex issue. Facility owners may not understand the complexities. •
    Financial—high costs can be associated with implementing some water conservation
    measures. • Institutional—government regulations can foster (water price structure)
    or hinder (regulations requiring irrigation to be done on a calendar schedule
    rather than plant need basis) adoption of conservation practices. • Management—the
    facility owner/management must place priority on water conservation on an on-going
    basis in order for the turf manager to fully implement a conservation program.
    6. Conclusions In summary, water conservation will become increasingly necessary
    on many turf sites, regardless of the climatic zone. Considerable knowledge already
    exists about many practices within this complex soil-plant–water source–climate–man
    system that can be implemented rapidly to achieve a certain degree of water conservation
    or water-use efficiency without sacrifice of turf performance. In addition to
    the current state of science, turf managers will be presented with a host of new
    tools for better water management and ongoing changes in equipment, chemicals
    and practices. In depth, continuing education will become necessary as new technology
    and new grasses must be integrated into ‘BMPs for water conservation’ to be truly
    efficient, properly implemented, and carefully monitored; but this paradigm will
    require whole-hearted involvement by all owners/facility officials and the turf
    manager associated with a turfgrass facility. References Aronson et al., 1987

    southwestern US, irrigation of turfgrasses can account for as much as half of
    the total outdoor water use (Devitt et al., 2008). This has led to the development
    of conservation strategies for turfgrass systems that minimize water use while
    maintaining turfgrass quality (Carrow, 2006; Beard and Kenna, 2008; Devitt et
    al., 2008; DaCosta and Huang, 2006). One of the main challenges for water management
    with all plant systems is to accurately estimate evapotranspiration (ET) and,
    for prediction purposes, to understand the underlying factors that control it.

    For example, McCready et al. (2009) reported on the potential of smart irrigation

  explanation: The study implemented here utilizes a variety of IoT technologies,
    including soil moisture sensors, weather stations, wireless communication devices,
    and cloud platforms, to collect and analyze data on soil conditions, weather parameters,
    and crop health. The collected data is then processed using machine learning algorithms
    to develop predictive models that can optimize irrigation scheduling, forecast
    crop yields, and detect early signs of plant diseases. The system also incorporates
    advanced sensing technologies, such as hyperspectral imaging and lidar sensors,
    to provide real-time insights into crop health and environmental conditions.

    \ such as the Internet of Things, raising the productivity of\nagricultural and\
    \ farming activities is critical to improving yields and cost-effectiveness. IoT,\
    \ in particular,\ncan improve the efficiency of agriculture and farming processes\
    \ by eliminating human intervention\nthrough automation. The fast rise of Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT)-based tools has changed nearly all life\nsectors, including\
    \ business, agriculture, surveillance, etc. These radical developments are upending\n\
    traditional agricultural practices and presenting new options in the face of various\
    \ obstacles. IoT aids in\ncollecting data that is useful in the farming sector,\
    \ such as changes in climatic conditions, soil fertility,\namount of water required\
    \ for crops, irrigation, insect and pest detection, bug location disruption of\n\
    creatures to the sphere, and horticulture. IoT enables farmers to effectively\
    \ use technology to monitor\ntheir forms remotely round the clock. Several sensors,\
    \ including distributed WSNs (wireless sensor\nnetworks), are utilized for agricultural\
    \ inspection and control, which is very important due to their exact\noutput and\
    \ utilization. In addition, cameras are utilized to keep an eye on the field from\
    \ afar. The goal\nof this research is to evaluate smart agriculture using IoT\
    \ approaches in depth. The paper demonstrates\nIoT applications, benefits, current\
    \ obstacles, and potential solutions in smart agriculture. This smart\nagricultural\
    \ system aims to find existing techniques that may be used to boost crop yield\
    \ and save time,\nsuch as water, pesticides, irrigation, crop, and fertilizer\
    \ management.\nKeywords: agriculture; land monitoring; control strategies; IoT;\
    \ sensors; economic growth; water\nmanagement and water resources\n1. Introduction\n\
    The Internet of Things (IoT) is an interconnected network of computing devices,\n\
    people with unique IDs, and the capacity to communicate via a network without\
    \ human\ninteraction. The Internet of Things (IoT) intends to connect the physical\
    \ and virtual worlds\nby interacting and exchanging data via the internet. Linked\
    \ industries, smart cities, smart\nhomes, smart energy, connected vehicles, smart\
    \ agriculture, connected buildings and\ncampuses, health care, and logistics are\
    \ all examples of IoT applications [1]. The increasing\nneed for food, both in\
    \ terms of quantity and quality, has required the development and\nmodernization\
    \ of the agricultural sector. The “Internet of Things” (IoT) is a promising set\
    \ of\ntechnologies that may be used to provide a variety of agricultural modernization\
    \ solutions.\nScientiﬁc institutions, research institutes, and the agricultural\
    \ sector are racing to provide\nmore and more IoT solutions to agricultural business\
    \ stakeholders, laying the foundation\nfor a clear role when IoT becomes a mainstream\
    \ technology [2]. The world’s biodiversity\nis anticipated to support between\
    \ 9.4 and 10.1 billion people by 2050, increasing the need\nfor specialized food\
    \ production zones, especially for harvesting and livestock. This means\nAgronomy\

    Agronomy 2022, 12, 127\n2 of 21\nthat by 2050, global food production will have\
    \ to grow by 70% [3]. Crop production is\nincreasingly crucial in agriculture,\
    \ with commodities, such as cotton, wheat, gum, and\nothers, playing signiﬁcant\
    \ roles in many nations’ economies.\nIn 2019, the IoT market was 690 billion dollars\
    \ and was projected to be 1256.1 billion\ndollars by 2025 with a 10.53% CAGR globally\
    \ from 2020 to 2025. Solutions are needed to\nassure timely and regular agricultural\
    \ growth and yield due to the combined effects of a\ngrowing population, natural\
    \ weather unpredictability, soil degradation, and climate change.\nFarm management,\
    \ animal monitoring, irrigation control, greenhouse environmental con-\ntrol,\
    \ autonomous agricultural machinery, and drones are examples of IoT applications\
    \ in\nagriculture, all of which contribute to agrarian automation. It also demands\
    \ contributing to\nagricultural food production’s long-term viability. Land appraisal,\
    \ crop protection, and\ncrop yield projection, according to these needs, are essential\
    \ to world food production [4].\nFarmers, for example, can manage ﬁeld environments\
    \ in real-time and more effortlessly\nregulate ﬁelds using wireless sensors and\
    \ mobile networks. Farmers may also utilize IoT\ntechnology to capture essential\
    \ data, subsequently creating yield maps that enable precision\nagriculture to\
    \ produce low-cost high-quality crops [5]. Figure 1 depicts the smart precision\n\
    agriculture cycle.\nFigure 1. Smart precision agriculture cycle.\nSmart agriculture\
    \ is becoming increasingly important to farmers in the modern day,\nand it will\
    \ become even more critical in the future to ensure proper ﬁeld expansion and\n\
    crop output. Unfortunately, traditional farming methods are not up to the task\
    \ of meeting\nrising demand. As a result, the ground stays barren and devoid of\
    \ fertility due to poor\nutilization of nutrients, water management, light, fertilizers,\
    \ and pesticides. Crop diseases,\nwater shortage, irrigation, and pesticide control\
    \ monitoring are only some of the challenges\nthat different IoT automation and\
    \ control systems can efﬁciently address [6]. This is why\ncontemporary agriculture\
    \ employs smart equipment and tools from sowing through crop\nharvesting, storage,\
    \ and transportation. The operation is smart and cost-effective due to its\naccurate\
    \ monitoring capabilities and fast reporting using a range of sensors. Autonomous\n\
    drones, harvesters, tractors, satellites, and robots are now complementing agricultural\n\
    equipment. Sensors may be instantly placed and begin collecting data, which is\
    \ then\nimmediately available for further analysis over the internet. By enabling\
    \ reliable data\ngathering at each place, sensor technology allows crop and site-speciﬁc\
    \ agriculture [7].\nUsing advanced control methods to automate agricultural activities\
    \ has increased crop\nproduction while also improving soil fertility.\nThe following\

    \ applications based on IoT technologies. Section 3 discusses the\nmany types\
    \ of equipment and technology available. Section 4 identiﬁes unsolved problems\n\
    and potential remedies. Finally, Section 5 concludes the research.\n2. Major Applications\
    \ of Smart Agriculture\nPrecision farming, animal monitoring, and greenhouse monitoring\
    \ are a few agri-\ncultural businesses utilizing the Internet of Things. Every\
    \ element of traditional farming\noperation may be substantially improved by combining\
    \ cutting-edge sensors and Internet\nof Things technology. At the moment, the\
    \ Internet of Things’ (IoT’s) and wireless sensors’\nharmonious incorporation\
    \ into smart agriculture can catapult agriculture to formerly in-\nconceivable\
    \ heights. Appropriateness of land, pest monitoring and control, irrigation, and\n\
    yield optimization are just a few of the conventional agricultural issues that\
    \ IoT may assist\nin resolving through the implementation of smart agriculture\
    \ approaches [7]. Figure 2\nillustrates the comprehensive paradigm of smart agricultural\
    \ monitoring system applica-\ntions, facilities, and sensors. Agriculture applications\
    \ are classiﬁed as IoT agricultural apps,\nsmartphone-based agricultural apps,\
    \ and sensor-based agricultural apps. Wireless sensor\nnetworks (WSNs) have recently\
    \ been used to enable IoT applications for smart agriculture,\nincluding irrigation\
    \ sensor networks, frost event prediction, precision agriculture and soil\nfarming,\
    \ smart farming, and unsighted object recognition, among others [8]. Signiﬁcant\n\
    instances of how new technology assists in the general improvement of efﬁciency\
    \ at various\nstages are included here.\nFigure 2. General paradigm of smart agriculture.\n\
    Agronomy 2022, 12, 127\n4 of 21\n2.1. Monitoring of Soil Moisture and Water Levels\n\
    Soil monitoring has developed into one of the most challenging agricultural areas,\n\
    both for manufacturers and farmers. Numerous environmental issues associated with\
    \ soil\nmonitoring affect agricultural yield. When these sorts of obstacles are\
    \ correctly identiﬁed,\nfarming patterns and methods become readily understandable.\
    \ The soil’s moisture content,\nwetness, fertilizer application, and temperature\
    \ trends are all being monitored. Soil’s\nmoisture environment management system\
    \ uses soil humidity and moisture sensors. By\nproposing an appropriate fertilizer\
    \ approach, the results of a soil monitoring test report\nassist farmers in increasing\
    \ crop yield [9]. The sensor can read both analog and digital\noutputs. The judgment\
    \ is made based on data collected from sensors and compared to\npredeﬁned threshold\
    \ levels. The soil moisture sensor is used to regulate the irrigation\nsystem’s\
    \ automatic operation. When the moisture level goes below the threshold value,\
    \ the\nwater pump is triggered [10].\nSoil mapping enables you to sow many crop\
    \ types in the same ﬁeld, allowing you\nto match better soil characteristics,\
    \ such as seed compatibility, sowing timing, and even\nplanting depth, as certain\
    \ crops are deeply rooted while others are not. Additionally,\ngrowing many crops\
    \ concurrently may result in more prudent agricultural practices, such\nas resource\
    \ conservation. The system is composed of a distributed network of soil moisture\n\
    and temperature sensors located in the root zone of the plant, as well as rain\
    \ sensors\nlocated in various zones. The microcontroller collects and transmits\
    \ all sensor data and\ninformation. In addition, a temperature and soil moisture\
    \ threshold algorithm will be\ndevised and implemented in a microcontroller-based\
    \ gateway to regulate the amount of\nwater given to the ﬁelds. Finally, the user\
    \ is provided with control via an IoT module based\non rain sensor data to interrupt\
    \ or restart water ﬂow as needed [11].\nIf the ﬁeld contains an adequate amount\
    \ of water, no water will be pumped into\nit. However, when the soil’s water moisture\
    \ content falls below a predetermined level,\nwater is pumped into the ﬁeld until\
    \ the desired moisture content is attained. The DHT11\nsensor monitors the ﬁeld’s\
    \ temperature and humidity. In addition, a PIR motion sensor\ndetects when an\
    \ intruder (human or animal) enters the area. Consequently, sensor values\nare\
    \ continually monitored and displayed on the farmer’s mobile device through a\
    \ GSM\nsim900A module, which includes a sim card with a 3G data pack and adds\
    \ IoT capabilities\nto the system [12].\n2.2. System of Irrigation Monitoring\n\
    Numerous studies have been conducted on a smart irrigation system. Food production\n\
    technology must signiﬁcantly improve to keep up with the growing demand for food.\n\
    Numerous experts have worked diligently to create an alternative to irrigated\
    \ farming.\nThese efforts, however, have not yet resulted in a feasible solution\
    \ to the irrigation system’s\npresent problems. At the moment, crop irrigation\
    \ is carried out manually and by established\ncustomary practices. When crops\
    \ are given less water, they grow slower and absorb less\ncalcium. Frequent irrigation\
    \ kills roots and wastes water. As a result, accurate irrigation\nof crops becomes\
    \ a considerable difﬁculty [13]. A smart irrigation management and\nmonitoring\
    \ approach is developed to enable autonomous delivery of sufﬁcient water from\n\
    a tank to ﬁeld crops. Automatic sensor systems are cost-effective, offered for\
    \ determining\nwhether plants require watering based on information gathered from\
    \ monitoring and\nregulating the soil water levels to minimize dryness or overﬂow\
    \ [14].\nKamaruddin et al., 2019 [15] developed an Internet of Things (IoT)-based\
    \ wireless sen-\nsor network (WSN) architecture that manually or automatically\
    \ administers and monitors\nthe irrigation system. The proposed method used NRF24L01\
    \ and Arduino tools as the\ncommunication network transceiver and CPU. The soil\
    \ moisture sensor data will be sent to\nthe base station via NRF24L01. Then, the\
    \ sensor node’s data will be sent to the cloud server\nthrough the base station.\
    \ This project utilized Thingspeak as a cloud server to store all data\nin a database\
    \ and connect it to an Android application.\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 127\n5 of 21\n\
    2.3. Fertilizer Administration\nAkshaya et al., 2020 [16] proposed an IOT-based\
    \ technique and upgraded the previous\nsystem, which predicted agricultural yields\
    \ using backpropagation and a random forest\nalgorithm. It recommends fertilizer\
    \ application rates and exclusively monitors atmospheric\ndata via a mobile network\
    \ and pump on/off action. The suggested technique utilizes\na segmented tank to\
    \ collect NPK fertilizer and water. The user can select one of three\nmodes (manual,\
    \ auto, or smart). In manual mode, the user is provided with the fertil-\nizer\
    \ and water ratios for well-known plants and fertilizers. In auto mode, all required\n\
    is to know the plant’s name to select the appropriate fertilizer and water ratio.\
    \ Finally,\nin smart mode, if the user cannot recognize the plant’s name, fertilizer\
    \ ratio, or water,\nthe plant’s name, fertilizer ratio, and water will be recommended\
    \ automatically. The IoT\nmodule will continuously collect information on the\
    \ temperature and soil moisture. The in-\nformation collected will be stored in\
    \ the IoT cloud. The mobile phone will inform you\nwhenever the given data changes\
    \ and the needed fertilizer ratio will be shown on the liquid\ncrystal display.\n\
    2.4. Crop Diseases and Pest Control\nHuman operators frequently monitor insect\
    \ pests via time-consuming and costly on-\nsite inspections, which results in\
    \ low spatial and temporal resolution. Remote monitoring\nhas been possible due\
    \ to advancements in remote sensing, electronics, and informatics.\nMonitoring\
    \ costs and effectiveness can be optimized through the deployment of camera-\n\
    equipped traps. With minimum human intervention, image analysis algorithms can\
    \ locate\nand count insect pests captured in traps automatically.\nReddy et al.,\
    \ 2019 [17] created an IoT-based system for disease and insect pest man-\nagement\
    \ in agriculture and the prediction of plant climatic factors. The integrated\
    \ sensors\nhelp in the measurement of soil and atmospheric moisture and humidity.\
    \ These features\nhelp determine the environmental conditions in which the plant\
    \ ﬂourishes and the plants’\nillnesses. It detects disease on the ﬁeld and sprays\
    \ prescribed insecticides. Web cameras\ntake images that are then preprocessed\
    \ to include RGB to grayscale conversion, defect\ndetection, image scaling, image\
    \ enhancement, and edge detection. SVM is utilized to\ncategorize characteristics\
    \ generated from Citrus Canker diseases, such as energy, kurtosis,\nskewness,\
    \ and entropy (damaged Lemon crop). The Arm7 microcontroller is used for\nhardware,\
    \ power, sensors, and motor driver control. Once the illness is identiﬁed, the\n\
    program will propose fertilizers and transmit the results to an LCD and the recommended\n\
    fertilizers. By pump, the fertilizers will be sprayed on the diseased leaves.\
    \ This study was\nconﬁned to the lemon plant to demonstrate that the same method\
    \ may be used for various\ncrops with favorable outcomes in the future.\nA solution\
    \ is presented for forecasting and detecting grape disease using the CNN\napproach\
    \ and real-time gathered data on environmental factors. First, the CNN technique\n\
    is utilized to analyze the leaf images. Then, different layers of the CNN method\
    \ are used\nto create the image. Finally, it is scaled to a speciﬁc resolution\
    \ before data is sent into\nthe CNN layers for training and testing. The suggested\
    \ algorithm was evaluated on four\ndiseases known to have a higher effect on grape\
    \ production. The diseases include esca\nblack measles, anthracnose, leaf blight,\
    \ and black rot. This gadget not only detects but also\nforecasts illnesses based\
    \ on historical weather data. On the other side, the readings from\nthe humidity,\
    \ temperature, and soil moisture sensors are transferred through Raspberry\nPi\
    \ to Microsoft’s Azure Cloud. Following this, the sensor readings are used to\
    \ anticipate\nthe illness using a trained linear regression model. Based on the\
    \ ﬁndings of the preceding\ndetection and prediction stages, suggestions for appropriate\
    \ fertilizers in the right quantities\nwill be provided to minimize fertilizer\
    \ misuse and cost savings [18].\nTo detect pests in rice during ﬁeld production\
    \ and avoid rice loss, the Internet of Things\nsupported a model-based UAV with\
    \ the Imagga cloud offered. The Internet of Things-based\nUAV was developed on\
    \ AI mechanisms and the Python programming prototype to transmit\nrice disease\
    \ images to the Imagga cloud and supply insect data. The Approach identiﬁes the\n\
    Agronomy 2022, 12, 127\n6 of 21\ndisease and insects by integrating the conﬁdence\
    \ ratings of the labels. The label identiﬁes\nthe objects in the images. To determine\
    \ the pest, the tag with the greatest conﬁdence\nresults and more than or equal\
    \ to the threshold is chosen equal to the target label. If pests\nare discovered\
    \ in the rice, statistics will be transferred to the ﬁeld owner directly to take\n\
    preventative actions. The suggested method is capable of detecting all pests that\
    \ inﬂuence\nrice production. On the other hand, this research attempted to minimize\
    \ rice waste during\nproduction by conducting insect monitoring at regular intervals\
    \ [19]. Table 1 summarizes\nmany current smart agricultural applications.\nTable\

    \ harvesting, warehouses, gas station), and\ntrack the location of objects in\

    \ on current market pricing.\n2.5. Yield Monitoring, Forecasting and Harvesting\n\
    The AWS IoT platform has been proposed for crop prediction using temperature and\n\
    rainfall monitoring. The Raspberry Pi is utilized as a gateway for remote monitoring\
    \ in this\nstudy. Raspberry Pi can connect with sensors to operate applications,\
    \ such as the DHT11\nTemperature Sensor and Soil Moisture Sensor, which forecasts\
    \ temperature and rainfall\nranges. The gateway is integrated with Amazon Web\
    \ Services’ (AWS) IoT platform. MQTT\nis a messaging protocol that allows for\
    \ various messages across distant connections [20].\nThe study reported establishing\
    \ an autonomous greenhouse smart aquaponics man-\nagement organized on temperature\
    \ via the use of an Android-based monitoring and\nautomatic correction system\
    \ and a Raspberry Pi-based plant growth monitoring system.\nReal-time data is\
    \ collected using the light intensity sensor and the ambient temperature\nand\
    \ humidity sensors. Additionally, the pH and temperature of the recirculating\
    \ water\nare monitored. Suppose the data acquired is beyond the threshold range.\
    \ In this case, the\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 127\n7 of 21\nsystem quickly engages the\
    \ correction devices, which comprise a peristaltic buffer device,\nan aerator,\
    \ an evaporative cooler, inlet and exhaust fans, and grow lights. The internet\n\
    remote access function enables real-time data transmission and receipt through\
    \ the android\napp amongst the smartphone and computer system. This study compared\
    \ plant devel-\nopment in smart aquaponics to traditional agriculture based on\
    \ soil systems employing\nimage processing in two investigational operations.\
    \ Following record collection, it was\ndetermined that the smart aquaponics system\
    \ achieved greater output than conventional\nagriculture monitoring. As lettuce,\
    \ mustard greens, and pak choi are produced in a smart\naquaponics system vs.\
    \ traditional soil-based farming, this study focused exclusively on\nlettuce,\
    \ mustard greens, and pak choi [21].\nA tree topology was used for the WSN-enabled\
    \ agricultural monitoring system to\nimprove performance. A cheap sensor node\
    \ like a commercial sensor or a NodeMCU\nmodule transmits data to the control\
    \ unit over Wi-Fi. Fertilizer, fertigation improvement,\nand agricultural operations\
    \ are monitored by data processing and thresholding. The in-\ncorporation of cost-effective\
    \ ICT technology with traditional crop management or weather\nmonitoring and sensor\
    \ data created the agronomic model. Minimal environmental impact\nfrom crop growing\
    \ was achieved as a consequence of large fertilizer and water savings [22].\n\
    2.6. Climate Conditions Monitoring\nIn farming, the weather is extremely important.\
    \ Incorrect climate knowledge can\nhave an impact on crop quality and quantity.\
    \ On the other hand, farmers may use IoT\nsolutions to put sensors in the ﬁeld,\
    \ including humidity sensors, temperature sensors,\nrainfall sensors, and water\
    \ level sensors, to collect real-time data from the environment.\nThese sensors\
    \ monitor the state of crops and the environment in which they grow. If a\nworrying\
    \ environmental situation is discovered, it is either automatically corrected\
    \ or a\nwarning is sent to the farmer.\nGreenhouses created an Internet of Things-based\
    \ weather station to address the cost\nand accuracy issues. The TI CC2650 Sensor\
    \ Tag and IBM Cloud Platform continuously\nmonitor weather and abiotic factors,\
    \ transfer the detected values to the cloud, and send\ne-mail notiﬁcations when\
    \ values deviate. As a result, this study may be expanded to\ninclude the use\
    \ of ML model-based classiﬁcation training to categorize a plant’s health as\n\
    excellent, moderate, or terrible based on the average temperature, humidity, light\
    \ intensity,\nand air pressure. This would help to clarify abstracts about a plant’s\
    \ health to a larger level\nand might aid in keeping the plants’ health in good\
    \ shape [23].\nArifﬁn et al. [24] used an autonomous temperature control system\
    \ to address the\ndrawbacks of traditional growing methods, which are expensive,\
    \ have low yields, and\nneed a lot of care. The suggested IoT-based architecture\
    \ was evaluated in a real-world\nsetting at the Bandar Puteri Centre of NASOM\
    \ (National Autism Society of Malaysia).\nThe ideal temperature for oyster mushrooms\
    \ is between 20 and 30 ◦C, with a humidity\nlevel of 70 to 80%. Two sensors were\
    \ installed in the mushroom house’s center and corner\nto detect temperature and\
    \ moisture, then communicated to a remote monitoring station\nthrough a microcontroller\
    \ unit for further action. The results of the six-day experiment\nrevealed that\
    \ an effective automatic monitoring system, which can regulate the farm’s\nhome\
    \ while reducing resources and human labor, was developed. The mushroom home,\n\
    IoT control box, and Web Client interface were all designed within the system.\
    \ As a result,\nthe mushroom house provided a regulated environment for mushroom\
    \ growing as well as\nprotection from pests and insects. The climate control system,\
    \ which automates controlling\nthe ideal environment for oyster mushroom production,\
    \ was housed in the IoT control box.\n3. Major Equipment and Technologies\nMajor\
    \ equipment and IoT technologies are fully demonstrated in the next subsections,\n\
    such as various sensors, agricultural drones, and harvesting robots.\nAgronomy\
    \ 2022, 12, 127\n8 of 21\n3.1. Sensors\nThe visual sensor, multispectral sensor,\
    \ thermal sensor, lidar sensor, and hyperspectral\nsensor are only a few of the\
    \ sensors utilized in IoT-based smart agriculture and drone\ntechnologies. Current\
    \ IoT-based sensor applications in smart agriculture are presented in\nTable 2.\n\
    Table 2. IoT-based sensors in smart agriculture used to increase production.\n\
    Sensors\nOperations of Different Sensors\nDHT11 Sensor:\nDHT11 sensor measures\
    \ temperature and humidity\n[12].\nSEN0193: Soil Moisture Sensor\nSEN0193 is a\
    \ Soil Moisture Sensor. The dielectric\npermittivity of soil is a consequence\
    \ of its moisture\ncontent. The sensor generates a voltage proportional\nto the\
    \ dielectric permittivity of the soil and hence to\nits water content. The sensor\
    \ takes an average of the\nwater content over its whole length. The Soil\nMoisture\
    \ Sensor is used to quantify moisture loss\nover time due to plant absorption\
    \ and evaporation,\ndetermine optimal soil moisture information for\ndifferent\
    \ plant species, monitor soil moisture\ninformation in greenhouses to regulate\
    \ irrigation,\nand optimize bottle biology research. [20].\nTurbidity Sensor SKU\
    \ SEN0189:\nThe turbidity sensor determines the quality of water\nby detecting\
    \ its turbidity level. It detects suspended\nparticles in water using light by\
    \ measuring the light\ntransmittance and scattering rate, which vary the\nquantity\
    \ of total suspended solids (TSS) in the water\n[25].\nMH-Z14A:\nThis is used\
    \ to monitor the CO2 level at high\nprecision.\nBH1750:\nThis is used to monitor\
    \ the light intensity level (as\nphotosynthesis is related to light intensity)\
    \ and to\nconduct experiments on the inﬂuence of light\nintensity on the greenhouse\
    \ environment’s\ntemperature [26].\nRain sensor:\nA rain sensor is a simple instrument\
    \ for detecting\nrain pressure. It may be used as a switch to\ndetermine the strength\
    \ of rainfall when a raindrop\nfalls through the rainy board [27,28].\nLidar sensor:\n\
    The top camera sensor is an imaging range camera\nthat estimates the distance\
    \ between the camera and\nthe subject at each point in the collected images [29].\n\
    3.2. Agricultural Drones\nUAVs can monitor the health of crops, apply pesticides,\
    \ and take hyperspectral images\nin precision agriculture. Drones can scan a crop\
    \ for issues in plants using visible and\nnear-infrared light, and they can determine\
    \ which plants reﬂect what quantities of green\nand NIR light. Photosynthetic\
    \ activity diminishes when a plant is stressed. This data may\nbe used to create\
    \ numerous images that track plant changes and indicate their health. As a\nresult,\
    \ farmers can more accurately administer treatments after a disease has been identiﬁed.\n\
    Drones are also utilized for surveillance, trafﬁc monitoring, and weather monitoring\
    \ in\nagriculture. Drone technology employs various sensors, including optical,\
    \ multispectral,\nthermal, lidar, and hyperspectral sensors, which are brieﬂy\
    \ detailed in Section 3.1.\nCrop management has beneﬁted from the Internet of\
    \ Things, remote sensing, and\nanalytic data approaches. Pests may be identiﬁed,\
    \ targeted, and managed to utilize remote\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 127\n9 of 21\nsensing\
    \ using UAVs. UAVs can ﬂy in tough and harsh terrains to take high-resolution\n\
    images that allow pests to be identiﬁed and controlled. Many crop security concerns\
    \ may\nbe solved using UAVs equipped with cameras, which are not possible with\
    \ traditional pest\nmanagement methods. UAVs have been used to automate insect\
    \ damage in agricultural\nareas [30,31].\nAn automated rotating device based on\
    \ sun illumination angle perception keeps the\nsolar panel perpendicular to the\
    \ sun and increases solar energy harvesting rates. Based on\nspectrum analysis\
    \ technology, Internet of Things approaches, including several wireless\ntechnologies,\
    \ such as TVWS, ZigBee, and LoRa, are suggested to collect data and send it\n\
    to a base station/gateway to assess the degree of damage caused by pests and diseases.\n\
    In addition, a technique for maximizing wind force usage and to extend the time\
    \ of ﬂight for\ndrones has been established to support drones in downwind by designing\
    \ the ﬂying path\nimplementation. The study’s scope is limited, with the goal\
    \ of developing a long-standing\ninsect and disease detection technique through\
    \ extensive data gathering and analysis.\nThe suggested model will be tested in\
    \ real-world scenarios. For example, crop diseases\nand insects might be tracked\
    \ in real-time and climatic changes could be analyzed [32].\nThe Internet of Things-based\
    \ approach is illustrated for smart agriculture monitoring in\nFigure 3.\nFigure\
    \ 3. IOT-based smart agriculture monitoring system.\n3.3. Harvesting Robots\n\
    Under speciﬁc climatic circumstances, a harvesting robot is intended to gather\
    \ fruits\nautonomously. The advancement of vision-based harvesting robots’ mechanism\
    \ is yet in its\nearly stages. Agricultural robotic systems, on the other hand,\
    \ have comparable architecture.\nThe system is comprised of an autonomous mobile\
    \ platform, a lightweight mechanical\narm with multiple degrees of freedom, an\
    \ adaptable end effector for a power response\nsystem, a multi-sensor machine\
    \ vision system, a smart decision and drive management\nsystem, and supplementary\
    \ hardware and software [33]. Kang et al., 2020 [34] developed\nan intense neural\
    \ network to assist robotic apple harvesting, which detects and grasps\nfruit\
    \ in a real-time environment using a computer vision system. The proposed robotic\n\
    harvesting system was implemented using a customized soft end-effector comprised\
    \ of\nIntel i7-6700 CPU and NVIDIA GTX-1070 GPU and DELL-INSPIRATION main computer\n\
    unit, Intel D-435 RGBD visualization camera, and UR5 Universal Robot (modern robotic\n\
    manipulator). The proposed approach uses Mobile-DasNet, a computationally efﬁcient\n\
    lightweight one-stage instance segmentation network to conduct fruit recognition\
    \ and\ninstance segmentation on sensory input. An improved PointNet model was\
    \ also developed\nto conduct fruit modeling and grip estimates from an RGB-D camera\
    \ through the point\nclouds technique. The two qualities described above were\
    \ utilized and integrated to\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 127\n10 of 21\ndevelop and build\
    \ a precise robotic system for autonomous fruit picking. The goal of the\nstudy\
    \ was to improve the vision algorithm’s performance, boost, and improvements.\n\
    Furthermore, the proposed soft end-effector robotic device may improve its grasping\n\
    recognition proportion and effectiveness under various situations. Ogorodnikova\
    \ and\nAli [35] devised a technique for recognizing ripe tomatoes in a greenhouse\
    \ setting using a\nmachine vision system of a harvesting robot. To effectively\
    \ execute the suggested image\nprocessing method for this purpose, RGB color images\
    \ from a typical digital camera are\nrequired. In the second stage, RGB color\
    \ images are converted to HSV, which is easier\nfor extracting red tomato from\
    \ the green backdrop in the image. Image segmentation,\nthresholding, and morphological\
    \ operations separate a red tomato from a green background\ncolor photograph.\
    \ The algorithm is built using Matlab methods and then evaluated to see\nif it\
    \ produces favorable results. The process can be converted into fast-acting codes\
    \ for the\nharvesting robot’s controller since it is basic and short. The research\
    \ is limited to moving\nthe gripper to the proper place in tomato detection and\
    \ developing efﬁcient algorithms\nusing 3D gripper models to transform the existing\
    \ research system into industrial robots.\nOnly a few robotic devices that can\
    \ successfully perform watering, planting, and\nweeding activities now exist.\
    \ FaRo (Cultivating RObot), a new smart robot based on a CNC\nmachine, has been\
    \ presented for automatic crop farming deprived of human involvement in\nagriculture.\
    \ What sets FaRo apart from other farming platforms is its capability to complete\n\
    the entire farming cycle, from sowing to harvesting. In addition, the FaRo harvesting\n\
    tool will be discussed and shown. FarmBot can only be used for a limited time,\
    \ from\nsowing to harvesting, after which the robot’s tool mount system will be\
    \ exchanged for crop\nharvest. In this example, the robot assumes the role of\
    \ a tomato collector. Both the FaRo\nharvesting robot and the unique kinematics\
    \ of the continuum manipulator design were\nthoroughly discussed. Due to implementation\
    \ problems, the robot’s design is currently in\nthe development stage. The objective\
    \ of the proposed system is to build a model with an\nintelligent agricultural\
    \ monitoring technique linked to the main database, and the robot\nwill have sufﬁcient\
    \ information to plant and cultivate crops without the need for human\nintervention\
    \ [36].\nA depth vision-based approach for detecting and placing truck containers\
    \ is proposed\nfor the joint harvesting system, along with three coordinate systems.\
    \ This method included\ndata preprocessing, point cloud poses transformation using\
    \ the SVD (singular value decom-\nposition) algorithm, upper edge segmentation\
    \ and projection, RANSAC (Random Sample\nConsensus) algorithm edge line extraction\
    \ and corner point positioning, and fusion and\nvisualization of results on the\
    \ depth image. Field trials show that the suggested approach\nis effective in\
    \ identifying and positioning vehicles. However, the study is restricted due\n\
    to its sensitivity to the appearance of truck containers and the presence of loud\
    \ sites in\nthe agricultural area. Autonomous driving and path planning in the\
    \ forage harvester’s\nunloading system is still challenging [37].\nIntelligent\
    \ robots have become extensively employed in various sectors as the in-\ntelligent\
    \ computer industry with automation expands. Currently, manual labor is still\n\
    used to harvest the majority of domestic crops. However, owing to constant worker\
    \ pay\nhikes, the manual picking technique increases the fruit farmer’s ﬁnancial\
    \ expenditures,\nand the appliances of robots in the farming business are challenging.\
    \ As a result, the\nsmart moveable robot picker has been introduced based on computer\
    \ vision machinery by\nincorporating the robot arm, selector, ﬂexible carrier,\
    \ track procedure, and the intelligence\nunit, which accomplishes the robot picker’s\
    \ travel channel coding, auto-judging the ripe\nfruit, and in addition a vision-based\
    \ binocular stereoscopic methodology employed for the\nfunctions of recognition\
    \ and placement. To begin with, precise segmentation recognition\nand maturity\
    \ evaluation of the target fruit is required for proper picking. Thus, the robot\n\
    picker may potentially replace human labor in manual picking. The most important\
    \ part\nof the recognition process is gathering fruit image samples, which is\
    \ performed using a\nCCD camera that shoots following the preprocessed fruit features\
    \ using image content.\nThe color model is then built up, and it separates the\
    \ fruit and surrounding surroundings\nusing segmentation technology before recognizing\
    \ the fruit. Additionally, it precisely traces\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 127\n11 of\
    \ 21\nand goes for the fruit location in relation to the three-dimensional coordinate\
    \ information\nprovided by the infrared source and the fruit contour and image\
    \ differences taken by\nthe two cameras simultaneously. To ﬁnish the picking operation,\
    \ it must program the\npath recognition to avoid the obstacle [38]. The overall\
    \ architecture of IoT-based fruit\nidentiﬁcation for harvesting is shown in Figure\
    \ 4.\nFigure 4. General architecture of IoT-based fruit detection for harvesting.\n\
    4. Open Issues and Key Challenges in Smart Agriculture\nThe problems of deploying\
    \ IoT-based agricultural systems are discussed in this section.\nThe sensors’\
    \ durability and cost are described. The IoT-based system requires a constant\n\
    source of electricity. Depending on the size, a lot of electricity may be required.\
    \ However,\nin rural and village communities, obtaining such electricity is challenging.\
    \ To meet the\nenergy requirement, alternative energy sources, such as solar and\
    \ wind, must be employed.\nThis will also raise the price signiﬁcantly. It is\
    \ necessary to have a dependable internet\nconnection in rural and village regions.\
    \ It is the most crucial aspect of establishing an\nIoT-based system. The connection\
    \ must have a sufﬁcient bandwidth to transport data in\naccordance with the application’s\
    \ requirements. Farmers need basic computer/tablet (HID\ndevice) training and\
    \ an understanding of how the IoT system operates. It is also necessary\nto provide\
    \ proper education on the unique IoT deployment in their farm [39].\nThere are\
    \ six major obstacles to developing a green IoT-based agriculture system,\ninvolving\
    \ infrastructure, mobility, maintenance, hardware, data privacy, data analytics,\
    \ and\ndata security. The selection of meters and sensors used for Internet of\
    \ Things tools is one\nof the hardware issues. As a result, many different sensors\
    \ may be utilized in Internet of\nThings applications, such as the water quality\
    \ sensor, humidity sensor, chemical sensor,\npressure sensor, temperature sensor,\
    \ and more. The data analytics problem is machine\nlearning, deep learning methods,\
    \ and prediction algorithm applications in smart agricul-\nture to produce a nutritional\
    \ suspension using IoT records. Routine sensor inspections\nof all Internet of\
    \ Things appliances are a maintenance issue while it may be certainly\nharmed\
    \ in the farm area. The mobility problem is related to 4G, 5G, WiFi, 6LowPan,\
    \ LoRa\nnetwork connection, which link sensors spread across a broad region in\
    \ the farm areas.\nSome infrastructural trials are developing and implementing\
    \ Internet of Things-connected\narchitectures that incorporate innovative technologies,\
    \ such as cloud and fog computing\nand network virtualization. Finally, the primary\
    \ issue in advancing smart agriculture based\non IoT is not physical maintenance\
    \ but rather ensuring security and privacy [8].\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 127\n12 of\
    \ 21\nThe UAVs that are linked wirelessly are subject to cyber-physical or harmful\
    \ assaults\nto fool the control signals due to open communication lines. Such\
    \ attempts represent a\nsigniﬁcant risk to the unmanned aerial vehicle system\
    \ in terms of private information\ncrash or theft, as well as mission failure.\
    \ Moreover, the faking of control signals may harm\nthe UAV mission and make it\
    \ harder to restore it. As a result, improving UAV wireless\ncommunication’s safety\
    \ and conﬁdentiality element, which necessitates in-depth research\nof security\
    \ concerns covering the entire network protocol layers [40], is an important\n\
    open subject.\nVisual harvesting of robots’ dynamic tracking of objects with great\
    \ precision remains\nan unresolved challenge. Further study should also aim to\
    \ enhance the precision placement\nand operation by merging smart behavior judgment,\
    \ adequate fault tolerance, robot vision\nwith artiﬁcial intelligence technology\
    \ for accurate placement, and function enhancement.\nThe recognition and location\
    \ accuracy are impacted when the crop situation is varied due\nto the lighting\
    \ and unconstrained circumstances of the ﬁeld ecosystem. A robot vision\napproach\
    \ would be efﬁcient in harvesting crops correctly to increase the success rate\
    \ of\nrobotic harvesting in such settings. The researchers used geometric features,\
    \ novel image\nalgorithms, and intelligent decision theory to address the challenges.\
    \ However, because\nmassive datasets are necessary to train efﬁcient deep learning\
    \ algorithms, further study\nis needed [33]. Table 3 presents a comparison of\
    \ the current state of the art on smart\nagriculture obstacles and beneﬁts.\n\

    One of the most challenging aspects of robotic grasping is estimation. Traditional\n\
    techniques have limitations since noise or partial loss of the point cloud might\
    \ impact the\nestimation’s accuracy and resilience. Estimation is more difﬁcult\
    \ in orchard situations than\nit was in interior environments.\nData Handling\
    \ and Processing\nTraditional vision algorithms’ performance is constantly restricted\
    \ in complicated\nand volatile settings [34]. World food consumption is predicted\
    \ to treble by 2050 due to\npopulation expansion and societal progress, yet increasing\
    \ food production is now difﬁcult\ndue to declining water, climate alterations,\
    \ less proper soil, and insects and illnesses. Pests\nand diseases have always\
    \ been signiﬁcant stumbling blocks to increased grain output.\nSatellite technology\
    \ is climate sensitive and has a limited illumination variation, making it\nchallenging\
    \ to satisfy the requirement for insects and infection management in farming\n\
    areas. Currently, low-altitude autonomous drones (offering excellent ﬂexibility\
    \ and image\nresolution) can satisfy the needs of agricultural insect and infection\
    \ management. In some\ncircumstances, such as when there is a high wind, drone\
    \ stability might be difﬁcult. As a\nresult, the drone’s ﬂight route must be designed\
    \ in conjunction with the actual conditions.\nLong ﬂights are necessary for ﬁeld\
    \ pest and disease data collection; thus, choosing a sunny\nday with a moderate\
    \ breeze might be a viable alternative [32]. Identifying malicious and\ncompromised\
    \ nodes among soil sensors interacting with the base station is a signiﬁcant\n\
    problem in the base station to cloud communications. The trust management method\
    \ is\npresented as one of the options for identifying these nodes in a lightweight\
    \ manner.\nFinally, the study highlighted the existing problems and possibilities\
    \ and future re-\nsearch in vegetable and fruit identiﬁcation and placement. The\
    \ majority of previous research\nshowed that illumination variations, grouping,\
    \ and unconstrained situations have been the\nmain obstacles to effective recognition\
    \ and localization of vegetables and fruits in the ﬁeld.\nFurther research will\
    \ be required to overcome the existing state-of-the-art challenges and\nenhance\
    \ the performance, accuracy, efﬁciency, effectiveness, recognition, and success\
    \ rate\nof controlling and image processing techniques. However, fruit recognition,\
    \ detection, posi-\ntioning, harvesting robots, and application robustness enhancement\
    \ need to minimize the\ninclusive computational cost and time. Future research\
    \ might include algorithms and cam-\nera operation advancements, sensor platforms\
    \ that can enhance illumination consistently,\nhorticultural changes, and human–machine\
    \ collaboration [29]. Furthermore, sophisticated\nmethodologies, algorithms, and\
    \ computational approaches are necessary to address the\nlack of precision in\
    \ harvesting operations.\n5. Discussion and Analysis\nIt is estimated that plant\
    \ diseases are a signiﬁcant contributor to global ﬁnancial\ndeﬁcits. Numerous\
    \ abiotic and biotic stresses and continual tension monitoring concerns\nthe impacts\
    \ of the loss of fruit-producing plants. Consequently, the $15 billion U.S. apple\n\
    Agronomy 2022, 12, 127\n14 of 21\nindustry loses millions of dollars every year.\
    \ Fruits are one of the most signiﬁcant sources\nof nutrients in plants; yet,\
    \ illnesses, pests, fungous, infectious, and microbial diseases all\naffect the\
    \ quality and quantity of fruits. Using computer vision-based methods, the issue\n\
    may now be alleviated. Diseases/infections may be detected early and effectively\
    \ using\nthese methods.\nThe sickness classiﬁcation of various fruit leaves was\
    \ achieved using a deep convolu-\ntional neural network DCNN approach. The deep\
    \ features are retrieved by ﬁrst utilizing\ndeep learning networks, such as AlexNet\
    \ and VGG-s, and then tweaked using a transfer\nlearning approach. Before the\
    \ selection step, a multi-level fusion strategy is offered, and\nthe chosen features\
    \ analyzed to produce the entropy basis features. To categorize the\nobtained\
    \ feature map, we employed a multi-SVM classiﬁer. The diseases investigated in\n\
    the experiments include apple rust, scab, black rot, peach bacterial spots, and\
    \ cherry pow-\ndery mildew, and they were all gathered from a plant village dataset.\
    \ The recommended\nmethod’s better performance in terms of a 97.8% accuracy, 97.6%\
    \ sensitivity, 97.6% precision,\nand G-measure was observed in the classiﬁcation\
    \ results (97.6%) [44]. Some research has\ninvestigated whether computer vision\
    \ approaches may be employed for scalable and early\nplant sickness detection.\
    \ There is still a critical lack of non-lab data sets that can be utilized\nto\
    \ allow vision-based plant disease detection. For visual plant disease identiﬁcation,\
    \ the\nPlantDoc dataset was supplied. The collection has 2598 data points in total,\
    \ encompassing\n13 plant species and up to 17 disease categories, and was developed\
    \ by annotating internet-\nscraped photos for 300 human hours. Three models for\
    \ plant disease classiﬁcation were\ntrained to illustrate the dataset’s effectiveness.\
    \ The ﬁndings demonstrate that employing\nour dataset models may enhance the recognition\
    \ rate by up to 31%. The recommended\ndataset, we feel, will contribute to decreasing\
    \ the entry barrier for computer vision algo-\nrithms in plant disease detection.\
    \ For photos featuring leaves from various classes in a\ndataset with contextual\
    \ noise, and low-resolution leaf images, the model fails to give proper\nconclusions.\
    \ Using image segmentation methods to extract leaves from the photos can\nboost\
    \ the dataset’s utility. Although the dataset has been rigorously veriﬁed, particular\n\
    photographs in the collection may be wrongly labeled owing to a lack of sufﬁcient\
    \ topic\nknowledge [45].\nIt is necessary to construct an improved VGG16-based\
    \ DCNN model to detect apple\nleaf diseases (scab, frogeye spots, and cedar rust).\
    \ The global average pooling layer re-\nplaces the fully connected layer to lessen\
    \ restrictions and a batch normalization layer is\nattached to boost the model’s\
    \ computational performance. Furthermore, to avoid a long\ntraining time, a transfer\
    \ learning approach is applied. To detect apple leaf diseases, the\nsuggested\
    \ model makes use of 2446 apple leaves, 2141 photos in the training phase and\
    \ 305\nimages in the testing phase. The experimental data reveal that utilizing\
    \ the recommended\napproach, the total accuracy of apple leaf classiﬁcation may\
    \ reach 99.01%. Furthermore,\nthe ﬁndings demonstrate that cedar rust is accurately\
    \ diagnosed, but one healthy person is\nmisclassiﬁed as scab and the other as\
    \ frogeye spots.\nFurthermore, the model parameters are cut by 89% compared to\
    \ the standard VGG16.\nAs a result, the classiﬁcation performance is raised by\
    \ 6.3%, and the computational com-\nplexity is cut to 0.56% of the innovative\
    \ model. Consequently, the DCNN model developed\nin this study provides a more\
    \ accurate and speedier way for recognizing apple leaf infec-\ntions [46]. Table\
    \ 4 compares the efﬁciency of several smart agricultural techniques.\nAgronomy\

    \ AlexNet was\nsuggested. Several innovations separate the proposed model from\
    \ others. It uses effective\nintelligent data preprocessing with a stable image\
    \ in each class, a transfer learning approach,\nand an extended and upgraded PlantVillage\
    \ dataset to work in more complicated situations.\nThe total accuracy of the suggested\

    \ precision, recall, and F1 measures of 99.49%, 99.11%, and 99.29%,\nrespectively.\
    \ Despite the fact that model training takes a long time, classiﬁcation during\n\
    testing takes only a few seconds on a CPU [47]. Citrus fruits, leaves, and stems\
    \ are included\nin the image dataset. The collection contains images of normal\
    \ and diseased citrus leaves\nand fruits, including greening, scab, blackspot,\
    \ canker, and melanosis. There are 759 images\nof normal and abnormal citrus leaves\
    \ and fruits in the data collection. The images had\na resolution of 5202 × 3465\
    \ (Mpix), and when scaled at 72 dpi, the width and height\nwere 256 × 256 pixels,\
    \ correspondingly. The contaminated images were divided into four\nvarious citrus\
    \ illnesses and left on their own. The entire process consists of four major\n\
    steps: (a) enhancing the dataset using Top-hat and then Gaussian functions; (b)\
    \ weighted\nsegmentation and segmentation of lesion through a saliency map, which\
    \ highlights the\ninfested area; (c) color, texture, and geometric feature extraction\
    \ from the diseased area;\nand (d) PCA, skewness, and entropy-based feature selection\
    \ and implementation.\nAgriculture management, water contamination, and air quality\
    \ analysis monitoring\nsystems were all investigated as part of the smart environment\
    \ monitoring (SEM) system.\nFigure 5 demonstrates that substantial investigation\
    \ of smart environment monitoring\nhas increased over the period in both cases,\

    \ [41,51].\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 127\n16 of 21\nFigure 5. Research contribution\
    \ using IoT, WSN, and machine learning.\nImperfect network access, lack of a (or\
    \ no) power supply, and high framework costs\ncompared to an ordinary farmer’s\
    \ income were presented in a low-cost, energy-proﬁcient,\nprotected, dependable,\
    \ and heterogeneous three-layer approach for Internet of Things-\nbased smart\
    \ agriculture. IoT devices make up the ﬁrst layer, including IoT-based smart\n\
    agriculture monitoring like insect detection, theft detection, crop monitoring,\
    \ smart ir-\nrigation, smart poultry, food supply chain, and food preservation\
    \ monitoring systems.\nThe low-power LoRaWAN network connects the IoT devices\
    \ to the gateways. The next\nlayer is made up of local processing servers and\
    \ gateways that are connected with the\ngateways. The cloud layer, which uses\
    \ the publicly available FIWARE framework to offer a\nset of open-source API standards,\
    \ is the third layer. This study aimed to create diagnostic\ntechniques for packet\
    \ combination procedures at the fog node before they were sent over\nthe network\
    \ facility to cloud servers. This aims to decrease short IoT packet processing\n\
    overheads and optimize energy usage at the backbone, as billions of IoT devices\
    \ linked to\nfog nodes are projected to generate massive volumes of short IoT\
    \ packets [52].\nA Cuckoo Search Algorithm has been created, allowing water allocated\
    \ for farming\nunder all situations. Temperature, turbidity, pH, and moisture\
    \ were collected utilizing the\nInternet of Things (IoT) infrastructure outﬁtted\
    \ with wireless communication devices and\nsensors. ThingSpeak presented the sensor\
    \ data in the cloud system in this IoT platform.\nThe ThingSpeak data was utilized\
    \ in the suggested Cuckoo Search Algorithm, which\nidentiﬁed suitable yields for\
    \ a given soil [53]. Incorrect or late identiﬁcation can result in\noveruse or\
    \ underuse of chemicals, resulting in higher production costs and environmental\n\
    and health consequences. With varied lighting, angles, surfaces, noise, and high\
    \ resolutions,\n3651 real-time indication images of various apple infections were\
    \ manually collected.\nA subset of this dataset was labeled by experts, such as\
    \ cedar apple rust, scab, and normal\nleaves, and open-sourced for the Plant Pathology\
    \ Challenge to Kaggle community. We also\nused this data to train a standard CNN\
    \ (convolutional neural network), which obtained\n97% recognition on a held-out\
    \ test set and a maximum AUC value of 0.986. The project’s\ngoal was to keep adding\
    \ additional images to the pilot dataset from various perspectives,\nlighting,\
    \ and distances to create a bigger more complete labeled database by experts.\n\
    The dataset will contain pests and diseases, such as apple mites and aphids and\
    \ apple\nleaves comprising apple marssonina and alternaria leaf blotch, leaf spot,\
    \ frogeye, rot, cedar,\nand powdery mildew, ﬁre blight, and scab-labeled images.\n\
    Additionally, it will be photographed and remarked on fruit infected with apple\
    \ brown\nrot, bitter rot, or scab [54]. An Internet of Things-based cost-effective\
    \ monitoring system\nwas developed to address particular crop irrigation, soil\
    \ erosion, and irregular irrigation.\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 127\n17 of 21\nThe suggested\
    \ method entails building a distributed WSN (wireless sensor network), with\n\
    multiple sensor modules covering each part of the farm and transferring data to\
    \ a central\nserver. ML techniques will aid irrigation pattern forecasts based\
    \ on yields and climate\nenvironments. According to a comparison of several algorithms,\

    \ weather conditions, the system\nis constrained in many ways: the forecast accuracy\
    \ is dependent on the setup’s correct\ninstallation, and the threat of wild animals\
    \ can harm the hardware setup [48]. Because\nhuman abilities and agricultural\
    \ gear are severely restricted compared to robot knowledge,\nrobotic systems in\
    \ agriculture can be highly beneﬁcial in achieving both high quality\nand quantity\
    \ goods. To integrate IoT systems with agricultural machinery, a new way\nof managing\
    \ control signals from the control system to the actuators is required. These\n\
    methods should increase economic viability while also lowering environmental impact\
    \ and\nenhancing food sustainability. It handles various agricultural tasks, including\
    \ moisture\nsensing, irrigation, crop monitoring, and insect and animal defense\
    \ [55]. Accordingly, a\nstate-of-the-art technologies-based accuracy comparison\
    \ is presented in Figure 6.\nFigure 6. Accuracy-based analysis of the different\
    \ state of the art techniques.\nWater monitoring is the most highly measured IoT\
    \ sub-vertical, followed by crop,\nsmart agriculture, animal, and irrigation monitoring.\
    \ All of these have the same proportion\nof peer-reviewed articles exploring the\
    \ possible uses of the Internet of Things. According\nto the ﬁndings, the most\
    \ important sensor data for measurement is 15.73% soil moisture,\n19.79% humidity,\
    \ and 24.87% ambient temperature. However, further sensor information,\nsuch as\
    \ soil pH and moisture, are also collected for IoT applications. Wi-Fi has the\
    \ highest\nclaimed use in farming and agriculture, with 30.27% and 21.10% use\
    \ of mobile tools, as\nshown in Figure 7. Other technologies like Bluetooth, WSN,\
    \ RFID, Raspberry Pi, ZigBee,\nLoRa, and GPRS are less popular in the agriculture\
    \ and farming industries. In the agri-\ncultural and farming business comparison,\
    \ the farming sector uses IoT for automation\nslower [42]. The Plant Server and\
    \ User View were created with phpMyAdmin to manage\nMySQL server management. The\
    \ F-RCNN-qualiﬁed model for anomaly detection had\n80% conﬁdence, while the technique\
    \ for the transfer of learning illness had 95.75% accu-\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 127\n\

    \ the RCNN model\nsuccessfully recognized 91.67% of tomato plant illnesses [56].\n\

    \ IoT.\n6. Conclusions and Future Directions\nThe implementation of sustainable\
    \ communication technologies and sensors based on\nIoT is necessary to increase\
    \ agricultural productivity. Wireless sensors, unmanned aerial\nvehicles, and\
    \ cloud computing have been shown to be practical tools for guaranteeing\nlong-term\
    \ agricultural productivity. Many processes throughout the production cycle,\n\
    including irrigation, soil sample and mapping, fertilizer or pest control, yield\
    \ monitoring,\nforecasting, and harvesting, may be automated using smart devices,\
    \ allowing for improved\ncrop quality and growth capacity. The key effective features,\
    \ important applications, IoT-\nbased smart agriculture technology and equipment,\
    \ and open barriers and possibilities\nwere all examined in this study. This research\
    \ will be expanded in the future to include\nsecurity and privacy issues in smart\
    \ agriculture using IoT methods.\nAuthor Contributions: All authors contributed\

    \ for precision agriculture.\n\nI hope this information is helpful. Let me know\
    \ if you have any other questions."
  extract_1: Precision agriculture is a crop management concept which allows farmers
    for managing spatial and temporal variability with in the agricultural field such
    as reduction of natural resources, irrigation management, production management,
    fertilizer management, intrusion attacks, and real time data monitoring [3].
  extract_2: The aim behind the adoption of sensors in precision agriculture is to
    enhance the overall production of crops. Sensors can help for measuring various
    parameters of agriculture land like humidity, soil moisture, climatic condition,
    intrusion detection, water level which facilitate that can lead to better production
    [4]. Further, sensor can collect the information regarding various parameters
    and process the collected information for better farming.

    all metrics Abstract Presently, wireless sensor network (WSN) plays important
    role in engineering, science, agriculture and many other field like surveillance,
    military applications, smart cars etc. Precision agriculture (PA) is one of the
    field in which WSN is widely adopted. The aim of the adoption of WSNs in PA is
    to measure the different environmental parameters such as humidity, temperature,
    soil moisture, PH value of soil etc., for enhancing the quantity and quality of
    crops. Further, the WSNs are also helped to reduce the consumptions of the natural
    resources used in farming. Hence, the aim of this review is to identify the various
    WSNs technologies adopted for precision agriculture and impact of these technologies
    to achieve smart agriculture. This review also focuses on the different environmental
    parameters like irrigation, monitoring, soil properties, temperature for achieving
    precision agriculture. Further, a detailed study is also carried out on different
    crops which are covered using WSNs technologies. This review also highlights on
    the different communication technologies and sensors available for PA. To analyze
    the impact of the WSNs in agriculture field, several research questions are designed
    and through this review, we are tried to find the solutions of these research
    questions. Similar content being viewed by others Wireless Sensor Network in Agriculture:

    Chapter © 2022 1 Introduction Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are the networks
    which are composed of sensor nodes. These sensor nodes help in sensing, gathering
    and measuring the information from the surroundings where they are deployed and
    transmit the data to the users. A WSN has small or we can say no infrastructure
    and having number of sensor nodes in it from ten to thousands which works together
    to monitor a area where they are deployed.WSN are classified into two categories
    structured and unstructured. Structured WSN are those which are deploy in proper
    manner into a specific area and can be easily configured if there is any problem
    in a senor nodes whereas unstructured WSN are those in which sensors nodes are
    deploy in bulk without any proper architecture these type of WSN are mainly found
    in those area where it is difficult for humans to reach easily and obtain data
    from that area. In unstructured WSN, it is difficult to take care of sensor nodes
    if they stop working or issue of node failure occurs. Wireless sensor network
    are classified into five types to monitor the parameters of surface of earth,
    underground conditions, underwater conditions, multimedia and to monitor the area
    by the help of movement of sensors. These five types of sensors are defined as
    Terrestrial WSN-In this type of WSNs, huge number of nodes are deploy into a surface
    of land that can help to examine the conditions of land. Underground WSN- As the
    name depict underground WSN are networks of sensor nodes which are deployed in
    caves, mines or underground surface for monitoring the condition of soil, moisture
    and military boarder monitoring. Underwater WSN- In this WSNs, sensors are deployed
    in the region of oceans, rivers for underwater surveillance. Multi-media WSN-It
    is a network consists of sensors nodes that have ability to store, process and
    access multi-media data such as video data, audio files and pictures. Mobile WSN-
    In this network, sensor nodes have the ability to move from one place to other.
    The application of such networks is military surveillance, monitoring of area,
    tracking of target, monitoring under water [1]. In WSNs, sensors are integrated
    with a radio transceiver and a set of electronics components which helps in transmission
    of data from source to destination. Sensor nodes have capability to organize themselves
    to create ad hoc, multi-hop network which helps in creating communication link
    between nodes. User can give commands to sensors; as a response of these commands
    sensors can transmit data to the user for example a particular limit of temperature
    is assign to the sensor with the help of embedded language if temperature exceeds
    from that assigned value than sensor provides information to the user [2]. 1.1
    Wireless Sensor Network in Precision Agriculture Precision agriculture is a crop
    management concept which allows farmers for managing spatial and temporal variability
    with in the agricultural field such as reduction of natural resources, irrigation
    management, production management, fertilizer management, intrusion attacks, and
    real time data monitoring [3]. The aim behind the adoption of sensors in precision
    agriculture is to enhance the overall production of crops. Sensors can help for
    measuring various parameters of agriculture land like humidity, soil moisture,
    climatic condition, intrusion detection, water level which facilitate that can
    lead to better production [4]. Further, sensor can collect the information regarding
    various parameters and process the collected information for better farming. The
    significant role of sensors in agricultural field is listed below (Fig. 1). Fig.

    Full size image 1.2.4 Citation Criteria For this review, the articles published
    in SCI listed journals are considered. To collect the good literature review,
    several search strings are designed which are mentioned in Sect. 2.3. But these
    search strings are not capable to distinguish articles published in SCI listed
    journals and non SCI listed journals. So, the separation between SCI and non SCI
    listed journals are done manually and all the articles published in non SCI listed
    journals and conferences are not included. The search strings also find number
    of articles based on wireless sensor networks, but these articles are not related

    articles taken from the individual journal. Table 1 Illustartes the categorization
    of articles with journals Full size table 2 Literature Survey This section of
    paper describes the literature survey of various research articles related to
    precision agriculture using wireless sensor network. This section includes various
    techniques, sensors, algorithms and sensor motes used for collecting information
    from agricultural fields. The literature survey on the usability of sensor nodes
    in PA is divided into three categories. These categories are (1) Monitoring of
    Crops (2) Irrigation Management of Crops (3) Environmental parameters for Crops
    2.1 Monitoring This subsection describes the works reported on monitoring of the
    crops. Sanchez et al. [6] proposed an integrated wireless sensor network as a
    solution for precision agriculture. This model can help to assimilate crop data
    acquisition, transmission of data from the end user and video-supervision task.
    The main objective this model is to secure the crops from intruders and identification
    of same in the agriculture field. The detection and identification of intruders
    are done with help of video surveillance. High consumption of energy and end to
    end delay problems are remain unsolved. The different hardware prototypes have
    been implemented for crop monitoring devices. The detection intruder is measured
    using infrared motion sensors and identification is consummated with the help
    of camera sensors. Zhang et al. [7] proposed a method to monitor vigor of the
    plant with the help of WSNs. In this work, the vigor of the plant is non-violently
    monitored through embedded and image processing technology. If unusual behaviour
    of a plant is identified during monitoring process, then warning message is sent
    to end users. With the help of wireless sensor nodes deployed in the field’s wastage
    of resources which are needed for cultivation of plant are minimised. Proposed
    method based on data fusion of fuzzy comprehensive evaluation helps in providing
    the well-organized way for monitoring the strength of plant in many phases of
    agriculture. Zou et al. [8] proposed an algorithm named as OASNDFA for achieving
    intelligent agricultural monitoring with minimum sensor nodes deploy in the field.
    The selection of location of nodes is difficult in hilly areas due graphical and
    weather conditions. This algorithm helps to find the suitable location of nodes.
    This algorithm works in three phases. The first phase considers the different
    relevant factor. In second phase, a mathematical model is designed with the help
    of relevant factors. The third phase consists of key points with maximum features.
    These features are computed through mathematical model. To address the vulnerable
    dynamic topology problem for monitoring the crops, Jiang et al. [9] proposed an
    algorithm based on tree topology, called dynamic converge cast tree algorithm
    (DCTA). This algorithm is employed within the monitoring system of WSN. The aim
    of the proposed algorithm is to obtain better data attainment for monitoring of
    growth of plant. The DCTA algorithm having three stages i.e. (a) routing which
    is based on dynamic routing (b) adaptable time slot scheduling (c) compilation
    and examination of data. This algorithm provides high data transmission between
    nodes. For real time monitoring of the agriculture filed, Kim et al. [10] proposed
    an WSNs architecture based on beacon mode with autonomous. This architecture provides
    the solutions for the problems like fire, intrusion attack, and lack of availability
    of resources. The proposed architecture is worked on the TinyOS platform and further,
    multiple beacon scheduling in the MAC layer with bop slots is considered. The
    dynamic address allocations and path recovery process for unexpected link is addressed
    on the network layer. The results staed that the proposed architecture having
    reliable transmission ratio for a real-time processing service like fire and emergency
    agriculture monitoring systems under heavy traffic environments. Intrusion attacks
    are one of the major issues faced by farmers. Because, intruders destroy the agriculture
    fields and leads to decrease in productivity. To address the same, Bapat et al.
    [11] proposed a wireless sensor network to protect farms from animal attacks.
    Sensor nodes equipped with PIR sensors, sound sensors, light flashers and RF module
    are deployed in agriculture field. Sensor nodes that are located near to boundaries
    of field detect animal entry and send information to the central base station.
    From the central base station, the information is sent to end users. To monitor
    the variability of nitrogen gas and biomass foe sugarcane crop, Portz et al. [12]
    proposed active crop sensor model based on WSNs. The results revealed that the
    proposed model is capable to indicate demand of nitrogen and biomass in sugarcane
    fields. The nitrogen sensor helps to detect the variability of biomass and nitrogen
    and preventing action can be taken for supplying the biomass and nitrogen into
    sugarcane crop. Reiser et al. [13] proposed WSNs based system for autonomous navigation
    of agriculture field. The proposed system comprises of location of nodes deployed
    in agriculture field and data attainment. The proposed system has advantages over
    the narrow transmission range of nodes. This system is effectively detected the
    faulty nodes. Smiljkovikj et al. [14] proposed an intelligent cloud based system
    named as Smartwine which monitors the wine production process using grapes. It
    works on sensor network platform having centralized server system which allows
    more than one users to use system simultaneously. The Smartwine system helps in
    decrease the cost of energy, water, resources and pesticides use for wine production.
    To monitor the agricultural production process, Diaz et al. [15] proposed a methodology
    which have seven phases that are (1) Study the condition of environment. (2) Design
    of sensor network architecture. (3) Role and Importance. (4) Implementation. (5)
    Simulation (6) Deployment. (7) Maintenance. The designed methodology represents
    the importance of wireless sensor in agricultural field and provides strong foundation
    for building applications with high productivity gain. To monitor the crops in
    green house and orchard, Zhu et al. [16] developed a monitoring system based on
    WSNs. The capabilities of the proposed system are evaluated using three different
    scenarios such as greenhouse, open farmland and orchard. The proposed system gives
    better reliable communication between sensors nodes deployed in agriculture fields.
    Further, it is also seen that rate of packet loss is significantly decreased.
    To attaining less management cost and high productivity in cultivation of crops,
    Srbinovska et al. [17] proposed WSNs based architecture for vegetable greenhouse.
    The developed system analyzes the various environmental parameters like temperature,
    humidity and light, for optimal conditions of crops. It is revealed that the proposed
    system would be able to improve the productivity and quality of crop. A review
    on infrastructure of WSNs for precision agriculture is presented in [18]. Further,
    in this work, a hybrid WSN model based on terrestrial WSNs and underground sensor
    network for precision agriculture is proposed. The objective of the proposed model
    is to reduce the human efforts for collecting agricultural information. It is
    seen that the proposed model provides information regarding agriculture fields
    more efficiently and accurately than existing sensor networks. To address approximate
    inference problem in agriculture field, Abouzar et al. proposed RSSI (received
    signal strength indicator) based-distributed Bayesian localization algorithm for
    message passing [19]. The proposed algorithm avoids communication overhead and
    minimizes computational complexity. El-kader et al. [20] proposed a precision
    farming solution model for potato crop [20]. In the proposed model, soil testing
    of land is done through sensor nodes whether the land is suitable for cultivation
    or not. This model also provides the facilities of better irrigation and fertilization
    scheduling to reduce natural resources. Further, it is noticed that APTEEN protocol
    is adopted for better routing paths. To monitor the parameters of soil, Georgieva
    et al. [21] designed a WSNs based monitoring model. The proposed monitoring model
    computes the different parameters of soil like temperature, humidity, conductivity
    and amount of acid. The arduino platform is used to integrate the different components
    of the proposed monitoring model. For providing better and qualitative connectivity
    and coverage of sensors in agriculture field, Kaiwartya et al. [22] designed a
    system for multi-metric quality measurement for deployed sensor nodes. In this
    work, seven metrics are designed for the sensor deployment and the optimal connectivity
    between the sensor nodes is measured. Lam et al. [23] developed a wireless sensor
    module for rural monitoring and precision agriculture applications. In their work,
    specification like received signal strength indicator (RSSI), packet reception
    ratio (PRR) of wireless sensor module was tested as compared with commercial products.
    The designed modules have capability to give optimal solution for real-world applications.
    Further, it can provide better applications for precision agriculture like reduce
    energy consumption of nodes, prediction of pest or disease and improved quality
    of crops. For better coverage of agriculture field, An et al. [24] proposed an
    effective technique for sensor deployment based on field information coverage.
    In this work, two polynomial-time algorithms are presented. The work of the first
    algorithm is to find the location of deployed sensors. Whereas, second is to identify
    the locations of relay nodes with minimum number of relay nodes in between source
    to destination. It is seen that the good trade-off between sensor nodes is obtained.
    To fruit recognition and disease detection, Lee et al. [25] designed a sensing
    system integrated with yield mapping system, sensors for detecting disease, devris
    detectors, an N detector for precision agriculture using ground and aerial based
    platforms. The proposed sensing system can measure the soil phosphorus detection,
    detection of nutrient in soil and grain insect detection with the help of NIR
    and RAMAN spectroscopy. To monitor the frost in vineyard, Valente et al. [26]
    proposed a collaborative system based on WSNs and robot. The aerial robot can
    be worked as dynamic node and it can be responsible for communication between
    agriculture field and base station. Further, in this work, UAV and WSN are combined
    for surveying fragmented crop fields. Zhang et al. [27] designed a remote monitoring
    system based on WSNs for collecting agricultural information. This monitoring
    system is based on ZigBee and GPRS wireless communication technologies. The agriculture
    data is collected through CC2430. The ARM9 processors are adopted to design base
    station. The proposed system is more feasible than other existing systems in terms
    of feasibility and it also conserve water content in agriculture field efficiently.
    Li et al. [28] proposed a monitoring system based on WSNs for greenhouse. The
    proposed system includes cluster of sensor nodes, base station and data centre.
    The JN5139 micro-processor is used for designing wireless nodes and further, ZigBee
    protocol is used for communication purpose. The proposed monitoring system is
    a low-cost, expandable and reliable model with better processing capability. Park
    el al. [29] designed an environmental monitoring system to prevent dew condensation
    in greenhouse. The proposed environmental system integrates the Bahrenburg formula
    to compute the dew point of leaves. Further, the dew condensation is prevented
    on the surface of crops which to prevent diseases infection. To monitors the environmental
    parameters, Carrascosa et al. [30] proposed an open source based hardware model
    for precision agriculture. The proposed model contains two main components i.e.
    hardware and software. The hardware component of the model is responsible to record
    environmental parameters, whereas, software component connect the device with
    data server. The characteristics of open source hardware model are low acquisition
    cost and less complexity for customization. Table 2 summarizes the work reported
    on monitoring of different crops. Table 2 Depicts the work reported on crop monitoring
    Full size table 2.2 Irrigation Management This subsection presents the literature
    works on irrigation management for the crops. To optimize the water content in
    agriculture field, Gutierrez et al. [31] proposed an automated irrigation system
    based on WSNs. The proposed irrigation system comprises of distributed wireless
    network of soil-moisture and temperature sensors. It is seen that the proposed
    system is feasible, cost effective and also reduce the amount of water content
    needed to the crops. To address the drought and tolerance issues of crops, Levy
    et al. [32] developed a method for irrigation management and enhancement of tolerance
    for the crops. It is observed that lack of water, drought, heat and salinity can
    affect the production of the crop. With the help of proposed method, all these
    factors are analyzed and it is concluded that required amount of the water is
    supplied through the proposed system to the crops. Further, it is noticed that
    micro-irrigation and drip irrigation systems helps farmer to conserve water. To
    measure the soil variability, Hedle et al. [33] adopted spatio-temporal modelling
    with high spatial resolution electromagnetic and digital elevation method data
    layers for quantify the variability of soil. Wireless sensor network with high
    temporal resolution dataset is used to mould the vibrant nature of soil moisture.
    The proposed approach is more accurate than a multiple linear regression modelling
    because it helps in providing best implementation of a variable rate irrigation
    system. For efficient use of irrigation system, Hellin et al. [34] developed an
    irrigation architecture based on WSNs for agriculture field. The proposed architecture
    helps in describing the design, optimization and development of an application
    to reduce the wastage of water. Sensor nodes which were deploy in fields are of
    good use they helps in reaching the required moisture condition to maintain water
    electrical conductivity level of the irrigation system at desired value through
    which there is a efficient management of water resources in agriculture field.
    To optimize agricultural irrigation, Nolz et al. [35] developed an irrigation
    model for monitoring the status of water in soil. In this work, two types of sensors
    are applied for measuring the potential of water in soil. These sensors are deployed
    under thin layer of soil to evaluate the status of water. It is noticed that the
    proposed irrigation model reduce the necessity of water to the crops effectively.
    A decision support system is developed for effective irrigation management in
    [36]. The proposed system comprises of sensor nodes, actuation network and fuzzy
    logic. The proposed method can reduce the wastage of water using fuzzy logic and
    actuation network. Further, it is observed that productivity of crop can be increased
    using this decision support system. Kim et al. [37] proposed an efficient water
    management system based on WSNs. In this work, the conventional irrigation system
    is replaced through an electronically controllable system for better irrigation
    management in agricultural fields. The proposed water management system is continuously
    monitored using GPS. Zhao et al. [38] designed an irrigation system based on soil
    water content and temporal stability. Further, in this work, water content and
    temporal stability is compared using VRI and URI to identify the location for
    deploying soil water sensors. In this work, temporal stability of soil moisture
    is evaluated regularly. It is seen that proposed irrigation system changes the
    overall similarity of soil moisture spatial patterns. It is also noticed that
    consumption of water is significantly reduced. To investigate the efficiency of
    linear move installed irrigation system, Chavez et al. [39] proposed a method
    for remote irrigation monitoring and control system (RIMCS). The proposed RIMCS
    system contains the pulsing nozzles and solenoids. The proposed system is also
    capable to vary the water rate. It is claimed that the proposed systems can monitor
    the flow of water, pressure of water, location and agriculture field. To control
    the irrigation in agriculture field, Maurya et al. [40] proposed a novel approach
    based on sensor technology. The sensor nodes are continuously sense soil temperature,
    moisture and humidity in agricultural field and transmits this information to
    base station. Further, in this work, region-based static clustering approach is
    used to provide efficient coverage over entire agricultural field. The proposed
    clustering approach uses the fuzzy logic technique to select best cluster head.
    This energy-efficient protocol is also compared with existing protocol like EEHC,
    DEEC, DDEEC and RBHR. To precisely monitor environmental conditions Sawant et
    al. [41] proposed a system. The proposed system helps in addresses the issues
    like standardized way of data discovery, access and sharing of data across various
    distributed sensor networks through the adaptation of a framework based on OGC
    standards for sensor SWE. The proposed system is a cost-effective, standardized
    sensing system which includes functionalities like sensor plug-n-play, remote
    monitoring, tools for crop water req. Estimation and nutrient management. A WSNs
    based irrigation software system is presented in [42]. The proposed system is
    named as WISC. The designed system provides real time monitoring of fields and
    remotes access to in-field information through WSN for irrigation purpose. For
    the proper irrigation in agriculture field, Coates et al. [43] proposed an irrigation
    model based on WSNs with valve control. The proposed model can sense the agriculture
    field for irrigation as well as also control the flow of water. Hence, in this
    work, manual control of irrigation valves is replaced through automatic control.
    To automate the irrigation process, Nikolidakis et al. [44] proposed an algorithm
    with collaboration of integrated system. This algorithm consists of advanced routing
    scheme i.e., ECHERP and provides efficient utilization of energy required for
    sensor motes. Nagarajan et al. [45] designed a sensor mote for sprinkler irrigation
    automation system. In the proposed work, humidity, temperature and PH sensors
    are used to control the water content of the agriculture field. The ZigBee communication
    technology is used for data transformation. Further, the GPRS system is adopted
    for data analyses and storing purpose. The proposed system is capable to perform
    real time monitoring and control water supply. An adaptable decision support system
    is proposed by Goumopoulos et al. [46]. The proposed system integrates sensors
    for monitoring soil, crop and climate in agriculture field. Further, this system
    is implemented in autonomous closed loop zone specific irrigation. This system
    is more effective in terms of agronomic performance as compared to traditional
    agricultural practices. Kim et al. [47] proposed a novel water monitoring system
    for reducing depletion of water resources. It is reported that fine-grained consumption
    of water resources can help farmers to pinpoint waste, and improve efficiency.
    The proposed water monitoring system can conserve the natural resources and also
    to reduce the amount of water needed by a crop. Masseroni et al. [48] designed
    a system for soil water monitoring and irrigation management. The proposed system
    is implemented using Arduino based open-hardware device. This system continuously
    measures the water level in the soil, especially in the root area. Further, this
    information is used to decide the irrigation timings. The proposed system reduces
    the water consumption significantly. An IOT based smart irrigation idea is presented
    in [49]. This irrigation system comprises of environmental sensors, web services
    and IOT devices. The proposal has deployed sampling algorithm successfully which
    will provide constraints for the sensor network. A model driven control strategy
    for irrigation in agriculture field is presented [50]. The aim of the proposed
    strategy is to provide right amount of water at right place in an agriculture
    field. Further, a predictive algorithm is incorporated in the proposed strategy
    for measuring the moisture content in soil. Table 3 presents the work reported
    in literature on different irrigation management system for precision agriculture.
    Table 3 Illustrates the work reported on irrigation system for achieving precision
    agriculture Full size table 2.3 Environmental Parameters This subsection describes
    the recent study reported on various environmental parameters like humidity, temperature,
    soil condition etc., to achieve precision agriculture. Rossel et al. [51] developed
    a soil sensing technique based on characterization of soil and environmental conditions.
    The objective of this technique is to improve the production of the crop and further,
    to reduce the environmental effects on crop. This technique measures and monitors
    the soil physical and biochemical attributes for better productivity. To compute
    and plot the spatial variability of soil, Bernardi et al. [52] developed a decision
    tool based on soil properties, yield and liming. The aim of this tool is to compute
    the fertilizer need and economic return of an alfalfa pasture. The vesper software
    is adopted to measure the spatial variability of soil and site-specific liming
    and fertilizer needed. Further, the information of fertility of soil is computed
    using spring software. It is revealed that it is an effective tool for mapping
    and evaluating the spatial variability of soil. Kuang et al. [53] developed a
    NIR spectroscopy based calibration model to acquire soil spectra in diffuse reflectance
    mode. This model is adopted to examine the different spiking strategies and spiking
    ratios. The effectiveness of the proposed model is evaluated using 425 sample
    of soil. The results stated that the proposed model provides more correct and
    accurate information regarding soil OC, TN and MC. To measure the electrical conductivity
    of soil, Parrilla et al. [54] designed a system using electromagnetic induction
    (EMI) based apparent electrical conductivity technique for olive orchards. In
    this work, both wet and dry soil conditions are taken into consideration. Further,
    it is seen that to check the efficiency of proposed model, forty-eight soil samples
    are tested for soil texture and soil water content. It is stated that in both
    situation (wet and dry soil), proposed model gives the same information. The spatial
    variation of soil phosphorus(p), magnesium(mg), potassium(k) have been investigated
    using geostatistics, conventional statistics and a geographical information system
    in [55]. In this study, total five hundred thirty-seven soil samples are collected
    for this experiment. It is observed that this model provides useful information
    for agronomic and environmental management for crops. To design a low water cost
    WSNs, Bogena et al. [56] have tested the applicability of different water sensors
    like EC-5, EC-20 and TDR for measuring soil water content. The experiment is performed
    both in laboratory and field. It is seen that in laboratory, the performance of
    the water sensors are almost same. But, in field, there is significant difference
    between the performances of the different water sensors. Authors claimed that
    EC-5 water sensor gives better accurate results among all other sensors and it
    is best suitable sensor to design low water cost WSNs. To measure the climate
    change mitigation strategies for ecosystem and agriculture, Knadel et al. [57]
    presented a study on the self organic carbon parameter. In this study, two different
    agriculture fields are taken into consideration and mapped using Veris mobile
    sensor platform. Further, fuzzy clustering is applied to obtain different field
    of spectra. The objective of this study is to identify either a single sensor
    or fusion of sensors can provide best predictive accuracy for SOC parameters.
    It is seen that the fusion of sensors is obtained best predictive accuracy for
    SOC parameter. Further, it is observed that low cost robust calibration model
    can be developed on the basis of Vires mobile platform. A soil property monitoring
    system based on WSNs is presented in [58]. The proposed system is deployed in
    the wheat field to measure the soil properties. It is seen that proposed system
    provides more than 95% real time information of soil parameters. Ritsema et al.
    [59] developed a stand-alone wireless embed network system for continuous monitoring
    of water contents at different depths. Further, this system is associated with
    web application to display the real time results for end users. To monitor the
    soil moisture dynamics from top depth, Majone et al. [60] presented a multi hop
    WSNs based monitoring system for orchards. In this work, sensors are deployed
    on different depth level i.e. 10, 20, 30, 50 and 80 cm. The proposed system is
    based on independent sensors that can provide both real time and historic data.
    It is revealed that distribution of soil moisture can affect the production of
    orchards. To find the low cost sensor and better frequency range for measuring
    moisture content, electrical conductivity and temperature of soil, Kizito et al.
    [61] evaluated ECH2O sensors family in the range of 5–150 MHz frequencies. The
    results concluded that ECH2O-TE sensor gives the better results at 70 MHz. The
    relationship and precision between volumetric soil water content and volumetric
    soil water content sensed are determined through four commercial soil moisture
    sensor systems in [62]. It is revealed that only the IM and RB systems are identified
    the high corelation between volumetric soil water content and volumetric soil
    water content sensed. Brocca et al. [63] assessed the reliability of soil moisture
    estimations through ASCAT and AMSR-E sensors. In their work, fourteen different
    sites of four different countries is taken into consideration. It is stated that
    AMSR-E sensor provides the high correlation between the observed and modelled
    data using LPRM algorithm. A review on the soil properties using remote sensing
    technique is presented in [64]. To characterize the underground wireless network
    and the basic problems for better communication in agricultural field, Vuran et
    al. [65] derived advance channel models. The proposed model helps in analyzing
    bit error rate for two different networks. The results obtain from field measurements
    used in evaluating parameters of soil and the effects of variation in moisture
    of soil. To measure the temperature of agriculture field, Badia-melis et al. [66]
    evaluate the behaviour of various sensors under the three temperature ranges that
    are 5 °C, 23 °C and 35 °C. Three wireless sensor network devices with different
    sensors are compared with four RIFD tags to get the information of behaviour of
    various sensors. Two alternative methods were used to adjust experimental data.
    For monitoring and modelling temperature variations inside silage stacks, Green
    et al. [67] designed a wireless mote which is deployed at different location.
    The proposed system helps in detection of temperature variation during decomposition
    of silage. To obtain real time information about environmental parameters of greenhouse,
    Jahnavi et al. [68] developed a smart wireless system. The designed system helps
    in giving optimal use of resources and water required for cultivation of crops.
    Microcontroller in designed system helps in transmitting and receiving data from
    sensor nodes to gateway node. Users can get real time information of greenhouse
    through web application where data is transmitted through gateway node. To control
    the eexchange of water and energy of heat between the agricultural field and atmosphere,
    Jackson et al. [69] designed a temperature and moisture sensor. The developed
    sensors are composed of micro machined MEMS cantilever beams which are equipped
    with water sensitive sensors. The variation in resistance of the sensor due to
    moisture depends on the cantilever beam thickness. For measuring temperature of
    agricultural field, Martinez et al. [70] proposed a cost-effective system named
    as LITAS. The designed system evaluates infrared thermometry and thermal imaging
    which supervised water stress level of the plant. The LITAS system tested in the
    field of sugar beet and the measurements of LITAS were compared to canopy temperature(TC)
    which is obtain from thermal images. Pierce et al. [71] deployed a two WSNs for
    agricultural process, one wireless sensor network is designed for regional-scale
    applications, such as weather stations and the second network is designed for
    on-farm applications such as monitoring of temperature for protecting agricultural
    field from frost. To monitor physiological condition of plants, Mahan et al. [72]
    proposed a smart cop IRT. The designed system is cost effective which can be easily
    deployed in large areas and helps in providing wireless operations that are more
    appropriate in various research and applications. To monitor climatic conditions
    such as temperature, humidity and amount of soil moisture. In agricultural field
    Mendez et al. [73] designed a Wi-Fi based network which is capable to intelligently
    monitor the condition of agricultural field in a designed manner. Table 4 summarizes
    the work reported on enviromental parameters to achieve precision agricluture.

    agriculture Full size table 3 WSNs Technologies in Precision Agriculture 3.1 Communication
    Technologies In wireless sensor communication various technologies are used to
    transmit the data from agriculture field to central point. The specification of
    these technologies is described in Table 5. Whereas, the WSNs communication technologies
    used in PA is given in Table 6. Table 5 Available communication technologies with
    specification for precision agriculture Full size table Table 6 Communication

    ZigBee—ZigBee is low-cost, low-rate, and less-power consumer device as compared
    with other wireless technologies that helps in secure and efficient transmission
    of data from source to destination. By applying a wireless sensor network based
    on ZigBee to an agriculture field data regarding to the conditions of field is
    properly transmitted to the user at high data transmission rate [74]. 2. Bluetooth—Bluetooth
    is a small range, low-power consuming device for wireless sensor network which
    helps in transmit data from one user to other in a range of 100 meters. It operates
    on the frequency band of 2.4 GHz [75]. 3. Wi-Fi—wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi) is IEEE
    standard 802.11b for wireless local area network which is operated in frequency
    band of 2.4 GHz deploy in a distributed way to cover the range of hundred meters.
    Wi-Fi is the most successful technology of wireless sensor networks few years
    ago Wi-Fi was only available on laptops but now a day’s Wi-Fi is easily available
    in cell phones, cameras, TV etc. [76]. 4. GPRS—general packet radio service (GPRS)
    provides fast speed of data transmission to the users. It uses the frequency range
    of 2.4 GHz. GPRS provides faster and long distance connection for data transmission.
    Range of GPRS is spread up to kilometres according to the coverage area of GPRS
    [77]. 5. WiMAX—worldwide inter-operability for microwave access (WiMAX) is an
    IEEE 802.16e standard used for a long distance communication technology. With
    the integration of WiMAX technology, the capacity of network can be raised up
    to 70 mbps [78]. 3.2 Sensors Used in PA Sensors provide huge contribution in various
    applications. In agriculture, sensors plays vital role for measuring various parameters
    of agricultural field. Tables 7, 8 show the different sensors that are used for
    precision agriculture. These tables also provide the details of temperature range
    and other capabilities of the sensors. Further, Table 9 illustrates the different
    sensor reported in the literature to monitor and measure the different parameters
    for achieving precision agriculture. Table 10 shows the list of different crops
    which are tested for precision agriculture using WSNs technology. Table 7 Sensor

    agriculture in literature work Full size table Table 10 List of crops reported
    for precision agriculture in literature work Full size table 4 Conclusion In this
    study, the adaptability of the WSN is explored in the field of precision agriculture.
    It is observed that there is the incremental growth to adopt the WSN in PA and
    having wide range of the applicability. It is reported that WSNs are widely used
    to monitor agricultural fields, optimize irrigation for the crops, measure temperature
    and soil properties. In this paper, seventy-eight articles are studied and arranged
    these articles into three different categories i.e. monitoring of the crops, irrigation
    management and environmental parameters management. Further, this review also
    discusses the different communication technologies of WSNs available for precision
    agriculture in literature. A list of different sensor used in PA is also given.
    The major contribution of this literature to scientific community is given below.
    RQ1) From literature, it is seen that number of techniques/tools are designed
    by various researchers for PA using WSNs. These tools are IMOTE2, Arduino, EZ430-RF2500,
    MDA300 sensor board, EZ43-RF2500, MDA300, Indriya, MICAZ, ZKOS, MSP430, PIC16F877,
    CVX toolbox, MOSEK, Veris mobile sensor platform, MDA320, MTS400. These tools
    integrate the different sensors on it and collect the information regarding various
    parameters of PA and this information is used for decision making. It is observed
    that Arduino platform is widely adopted as a platform to integrate different sensors
    due to low cost and ease to embed. It is also seen that some algorithms are also
    developed for effective monitoring and smart irrigation of crops. These algorithms
    include OASNDFA, DCTA, BOP, LAA, distributed localization algorithm, range based
    localization algorithms, polynomial-time algorithms for deployment of nodes, electromagnetic
    induction algorithm, MLR, PCR and PLSR methods. Some of new communication protocols
    are also reported in few research articles like APTEEN protocol, Fuzzy based energy
    efficient protocol, ECHERP. It is also revealed that the Tiny OS and Tiny OS 2.0
    are taken as operating system for sensors. RQ2) In precision agriculture, large
    numbers of sensors are adopted for collecting the real time information about
    the growth of crops as well as different environmental parameters like humidity,
    temperature, soil moisture etc. All these information is collected through randomly
    deployed sensor nodes. Further, this information is collected on a central point
    for processing purpose. The processed information is used in decision making and
    action is taken according the processed information. Table 9 shows the list of
    different sensors reported in literature. This table also illustrates the significance
    of each sensor and citation details of these sensors are also given. The working
    of few sensors is discussed as Sensor s8000 measures the PH parameter, HYDRA-PROBE
    II sensor measure conductivity, salinity, soil moisture, and temperature values.
    EC-10HS measure the moisture of soil, EC-5 sensor for measuring soil moisture,
    SHT-11 sensor for measuring temperature and humidity, N-sensor for measuring the
    requirement of nitrogen to the crop, VH400 is a soil-moisture sensor which measure
    the amount of moisture present in soil, DS1822 sensor is used to measure the temperature,
    SEN-13322 sensors measure the volumetric content of water in the soil. It is found
    that PA cannot achieve without the help of these sensors. Table 8 illustrates
    the list of sensors used for measuring weather conditions. It is seen that in
    PA, most of works is reported on measuring the soil parameters. RQ3) Large numbers
    of crops are taken into consideration in literature to validate the applicability
    of the WSNs in agriculture. The aim to adopt the WSNs in agriculture is to monitor
    the crops, irrigation management and measure the different environmental parameters
    which are responsible for the growth and improved quality of the crops. Table
    10 demonstrates the list of crops which are considered for experimentation. It
    is found that eighteen different crops are taken by researchers to investigate
    the role of WSNs in agriculture. These crops include broccoli crop, cotton plant,
    orange orchards, orchid greenhouses, vinyl greenhouse, sugarcane field, grape
    farms, pepper vegetable greenhouse, potato crop, citrus and blueberry crop, maize
    field, wheat, peach orchards and many more. Further, it is observed that WSNs
    is widely used to monitor the growth of crops in green houses. RQ4) From literature,
    it is seen that five communication technologies are adopted in WSNs for PA. These
    communication technologies are described in Table 5. These are Bluetooth, ZigBee,
    Wi-Fi, GPRS/GSM and WiMAX. Out of these five techniques, only four techniques
    are used. Presently, WiMAX communication technology is not adopted in PA till
    date due to high cost and large size. Table 6 shows the various communication
    technologies cited in different research articles. It is concluded that most of
    researchers works with the ZigBee communication technology due to high transmission
    range and low cost and cited in twenty-seven research articles. The second most
    valuable communication technology is GSM/GPRS and it is cited in sixteen research
    articles. Apart from these, several points can be highlighted from this study.
    Seventy-eight SCI listed research articles are included in this study from thirty-five
    different journals. In PA, lot of works are reported on measuring soil parameters
    including soil moisture, PH value, soil temperature etc., for improving quality
    of crops. For effective monitoring and irrigation management, some algorithms
    are also presented by various researchers in the field of PA. Tiny OS and Tiny
    OS 2.0 are adopted as operating system for sensor nodes due to low complexity.
    It is noted that Arduino platform is widely adopted to integrate the different
    component of WSNs in PA. In PA, some work is also reported on communication protocols.
    Some of new communication protocols are developed for effective communication
    between different components of WSNs. This review also lightens on the communication
    technologies adopted in WSNs for PA. It is found that till date only four communication
    technologies is used. It is seen that widely adopted communication technology
    is ZigBee. A lot of crops have been investigated by using WSNs for precision agriculture.
    It is observed that vineyard crop is examined multiple times. EC-5 senor is widely
    used for measuring the soil moisture. Some works are also presented on the deployment
    of sensor nodes in agriculture filed. In few research articles, automatic irrigation
    model is also proposed and these models also reduce the human effort. Few of articles
    are reported on intrusion detection in the agriculture field. Hence, there is
    a scope of work in this direction. Lack of work is reported on the usability of
    fertilizers in the agriculture field. Abbreviations APTEEN: Adaptive periodic

    to the Internet is experiencing an explosive growth. The interconnection of smart
    objects embedded with sensors enables them to interact with the environment and
    among themselves, forming a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). These network nodes
    perform acquisition, collection and analysis of data, such as temperature and
    soil moisture. Such data can be employed to automate the irrigation process in
    agriculture while decreasing water consumption, resulting in monetary and environmental
    benefits. The high storage and processing capabilities, the rapid elasticity and
    payper-use characteristics makes Cloud Computing an attractive solution to the
    large amount of data generated by the WSN. This paper proposes and evaluates on
    a real deployment a cloud-based Wireless Sensor and Actuator Network (WSAN) communication
    system. This solution monitors and controls a set of sensors and actuators, respectively,
    to assess plants water needs. Published in: 2015 IEEE 2nd World Forum on Internet

    IEEE Conference Location: Milan, Italy SECTION I. Introduction Recent developments
    are enabling the deployment of miniaturized and low-cost electronics in a variety
    of sectors, such as Agriculture. Playing an important role in the economy of most
    nations, agricultural production has been experiencing the continuous improvement
    of its processes and techniques. The objective of Precision Agriculture (PA) is
    to improve products quality, as well as maintaining a sustainable agriculture,
    by collecting real-time data from the environment. So, there is the need for optimizing
    the resources employed in the agricultural processes, mainly in the irrigation
    system. Water plays a crucial role in plants lifecycle, including germination,
    photosynthesis and nutrition processes [1]. Most often, the water provided by
    natural precipitation is not enough to provide the amount of water needed by the
    plants for a healthy growth. Currently, agriculture consumes about 70% of the
    fresh water [2]. This percentage can be decreased performing efficient water management
    when it comes to irrigation. Precision Irrigation applies the water efficiently,
    in the right place, at the right time and in the right amount. It brings wide
    benefits, such as water savings, money savings as well as the improvement of crop
    quality. Precision agriculture involves collecting and interpreting huge amounts
    of data from the field so as to understand the causes of variability, and propose
    strategies for field management. The most important agricultural process, which
    can be controlled and adapted to better suit the plants growth, is related to
    irrigation. First and foremost there is the need to acquire data in order to be
    further analyzed and compared. This amount of data is enormous. If this data is
    not organized and processed, it will become meaningless. Difficulties in the adoption
    of precision agriculture are thus related to data handling and data processing
    [3]. Other adoption issue concerns significant investment costs in hardware solutions
    to store and process this huge amount of data [4]. Hence, it becomes very important
    to provide a system that is economically viable for a single farmer as well as
    to a big farming company. This paper proposes a cloud-based solution for a smart
    irrigation system organized as a Wireless Sensor and Actuator Network (WSAN).
    A remote web service is employed to optimize the system with weather knowledge.
    SECTION II. Related Work This section reviews relevant previous work in smart
    irrigation systems using Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). A. SensorScope SensorScope
    [5] consists of a WSN-based system for environmental monitoring to substitute
    traditional, expensive sensing stations by a low-cost system. Stations transmit
    regularly the gathered data to a sink node. This node forwards the data received
    to SensorScope Database, which in turn makes it available to other servers. Each
    sensor node (Shockfish TinyNodes) is placed in a sensor box, which also contains
    primary and secondary batteries. A sensing station includes a sensor node, a solar
    panel and environmental sensors. Each station contains up to seven sensors, capable
    of measuring up to nine environmental quantities: air humidity, air temperature,
    precipitation, soil moisture, solar radiation, surface temperature, water content,
    wind direction and speed. Indoor and outdoor experimental tests were conducted
    to test SensorScope viability. The most relevant test was on a rock glacier located
    at 2500m of altitude on the Génépi Switzerland, being the source of dangerous
    mud streams during rainfall, which caused accidents by flooding the adjacent road.
    A total of 16 stations were deployed. The collected data comprises rain, wind
    and temperature measurements. The acquired information allowed the identification
    of the region microclimate, which helped predicting the evolution of the frozen
    soils. B. Water Sustainability in Municipal Green Spaces Fazackerley et al. [6]
    describe an irrigation control system deployed in a municipal green space in the
    city of Kelowna, Canada. This space consists on a turf landscape, which is divided
    into zones. A zone is a turf grass area that is watered simultaneously, controlled
    by valves. This system aims to determine the best time to supply water at each
    zone, and the ideal amount. To minimize water waste, the system uses an improved
    adaptive irrigation algorithm. It calculates the amount of water to apply in a
    certain zone, depending on the maximum water volume that the soil can store. A
    wireless sensor node was deployed in each zone. Each node includes two Decagon
    EC-5 dielectric soil moisture sensors, as well as a wireless radio. One of the
    soil moisture sensors was placed in the rooting zone. The other one was placed
    below the rooting zone, and its readings were not used in the adaptive algorithm.
    The readings acquired by the soil moisture sensors are transmitted to the adaptive
    irrigation controller. The latter is coupled with a commercial controller, which
    receives remote updates. These are used to estimate irrigation scheduling based
    on EvapoTranspiration (ET). The adaptive irrigation controller sends the messages
    over a 3G network to a central server using TCP/IP. These messages contain soil
    moisture readings from each zone as well as information regarding irrigation events.
    For evaluating water savings, the system stores both the actual watering events
    as well as the irrigation events as determined by the commercial controller. The
    total amount of water delivered based on soil moisture sensors offered 47% of
    water savings compared to the amount of water only based on the commercial controller.
    C. Vineyard Computing Another work [7] studied the needs and priorities of vineyard
    workers, to provide a Wireless Sensor Network for helping workers. The authors
    studied workers and their practices through interviews, site tours and observational
    work. They concluded that the greatest variability of the vineyard parameters
    occurred during daytime. So, there should be a highest number of readings during
    the day, and less frequently during the night. They also report that during the
    winter the vineyard could be at risk, because there is the possibility of frost
    formation. Due to this problem, there should be frequent readings during cold
    nights, and an alert system to notify the manager whenever the temperatures go
    below a certain threshold. They observed workers often required actionable data,
    i.e., data that helps the workers to suggest the next step. For instance, a map
    evidencing the vineyard areas at risk of powdery mildew (a fungal disease), calculated
    from temperature data readings of the vineyard over a period of time. This way,
    the vineyard manager could apply spray pesticides on the affected area. Data is
    acquired by the sensor nodes in the vineyard every 60 secs. Data mules collect
    and transport this data from the sensor nodes to the central database. Workers
    move up and down the rows of the vineyard several times, so they could serve as
    “mules” by transporting a small device, which would wirelessly collect the data
    from the distributed nodes. Whenever the gathering device was physically close
    to a node, data would be transmitted, whenever new data were available. Data mules
    give networks the capability to emulate distributed nodes through the vineyard,
    since they do not need to communicate with their neighbors. The disadvantage of
    data mules is the energy consumption, since the nodes must be always awake to
    detect and communicate with the data mule. Furthermore, this approach cannot be
    used in applications with real-time requirements (which was not the case, since
    vineyard managers do not need to calculate heat units immediately). The use of
    data mules allows the reduction of equipment costs. D. Discussion All the above
    mentioned systems are very similar regarding the WSN they comprise, except for
    the Vineyard Computing project, which uses the data mules concept. Communication
    between nodes is mainly performed using 802.15.4 or similar, whereas the communication
    between the sink nodes and servers are usually performed through cellular networks.
    These systems use one or more servers to store the data they collect from the
    sensor nodes, implying an initial capital cost investment and the servers maintenance.
    Moreover, as more sensor nodes are added to the network, more data they generate.
    This may cause the servers to have no space for information storage. The SensorScope
    project highlighted the importance of saving all the raw data collected from sensor
    nodes. This information can be further employed to help investigations into a
    variety of topics. For instance, the continuous study for an optimized irrigation
    system, or the improvement of the discovery process of plants diseases. SECTION
    III. System Architecture This work aims to address a variety of distinct scenarios,
    such as agriculture, greenhouses, golf courses and landscapes. The proposed architecture
    (see Figure 1) must be modular to be adapted to each scenario requirements. It
    can be divided in three main components: a WSAN component, a cloud platform component,
    and a user application component. The WSAN contains three different types of nodes:
    a sink node, a sensor node, and an actuator node. Fig. 1. Proposed architecture.
    Show All The communication between the wireless nodes has to be performed by a
    low range communication protocol, such as ZigBee and 802.15.4. The choice of network
    protocol for the WSAN fell on the proprietary SimpliciTI, developed by Texas Instruments,
    due to its simplicity, low power and cost. SimplitiTI provides a simple protocol
    for WSAN implementation in a cluster tree topology. It supplies APIs to easily
    manage messaging between devices. This protocol does not have a formal routing
    mechanism. However, it supports the creation by software of three logical objects
    corresponding to the sensor nodes: End Device (ED), Access Point (AP) and Range
    Extender (RE), corresponding to the End Node, Sink Node and Router Node previously
    described, respectively. A. Sensor Nodes The hardware used for implementing the
    End Device and Range Extender device is the AA battery powered node of the eZ430-RF2500
    Kit. This includes the MSP430F2274 microcontroller and the 2.4GHz CC2500 RF Transceiver,
    shown in Figure 2a. Each ED/RE device has a soil moisture sensor connected to
    it. Fig. 2. a) final ED/RE device and case; b) final access point device. Show
    All Both ED and RE implement the same logical procedure, with the exception that
    the RE device also forwards the packets from other nodes to the Access Point.
    The procedure starts with the initialization of the hardware interfaces and the
    network protocol. The devices then perform soil moisture and battery readings
    with a pre-defined sampling frequency. Each time a measurement is available, the
    device sends it to the Access Point. Devices also receive control messages from
    the AP, for changing the measurements sampling frequency. The initial AP hardware
    implementation makes use of the same board of the ED/RE devices, which provided
    the RF radio capabilities to exchange messages within the WSAN network. This hardware
    was connected with another board (through an UART interface) with GPRS (General
    Packet Radio Service) capabilities, designed by Sensefinity. This board includes
    the MSP430F5419A microcontroller and the SIM908 module. The AP device, depicted
    in Figure 2b, also has the capability to control up to two distinct actuators
    (for performing the actuator turn ON / OFF) through the use of one of the available
    GPIO pins of the microcontroller. The eZ430-RF2500 board starts its logical procedure
    by initializing the hardware interfaces and the network protocol. Afterwards it
    is responsible for receiving the measurement messages from other network devices,
    and forward them to the other board. The board with GPRS capabilities manages
    the measurement messages, storing them in a queue, waiting to be sent to the cloud.
    Whenever the queue reaches a certain threshold, the messages are formatted to
    the Columbus message format (used by the Machinates cloud platform), encoded to
    base64, and finally sent to the cloud platform through HTTP. Whenever the GPRS-enabled
    board receives a measurement message, it stamps it with the current timestamp,
    provided by the on-board RTC (Real Time Clock). Once the board is initialized,
    it gets the timestamp information from the GPS module (included in the SIM908)
    to properly initialize the RTC with the current time. Besides sending measurement
    messages to the cloud platform, this board is also responsible for receiving the
    irrigation instructions from the cloud, activating or deactivating the actuator.
    Whenever the actuator is activated (consequently starting irrigation), a control
    message is sent to the other network nodes to increase the soil moisture sampling
    frequency. The actuator deactivation also results in the modification of the sampling
    frequency to the previous frequency. This adaptive sampling frequency allows to
    better control the irrigation system to optimize it, since more information becomes
    available during irrigation. B. WSAN Infrastructure Every distinct network node
    may, or not, have actuation capabilities. The proportion of actuators comprised
    in the network depends on the application scenario and the type of actuator mechanism
    employed for irrigation. In certain scenarios there is the need to have one actuator
    in each network node, whereas in other scenarios a single actuator can be responsible
    for a zone that may comprise several nodes. Network nodes are organized on a cluster-tree
    topology, due to its high scalability, good energy efficiency, as well as reliability.
    Compared to the cluster-tree topology, the star topology does not provide good
    scalability, and the mesh topology is poor in reliability and energy efficiency.
    Notice however that if the application scenario requires a small-scale network,
    the star topology can be employed instead. Since the network nodes are static,
    adaptive routing is not needed. Hence, it should be used a tree-based routing.
    Whenever joining the network, the nodes establish a parent-child link. Routing
    between the nodes is relatively simple using these parent-child relationships.
    On a cluster-tree topology, the sink node will act as the network coordinator,
    whereas the sensor and actuator nodes can act either as a router node and/or an
    end node. Some nodes may work only as repeaters to extend network outreach, without
    sensing or actuation capabilities. The sink node has two communication interfaces:
    one for interaction with the wireless nodes, and another for communication with
    the cloud platform. Depending on the deployment scenario, the data transmission
    between the sink node and the cloud platform can be performed through a variety
    of technologies (wired or wireless). For instance, if the WSAN deployment occurs
    in an agricultural field, the use of wired links may not be appropriate because
    it can interfere with the workers activities. Regarding wireless links, the more
    appropriate technologies are either Wi-Fi 802.11 or GPRS. The decreasing costs
    of the GPRS communications, along with the deployment of the WSAN in remote zones,
    led to the use of GPRS in this work. In situations where GPRS connectivity is
    poor, 802.11 could be employed for sending the data through a gateway. C. Cloud
    Platform Sensefinity Machinates cloud platform, besides storing all the measurements
    received from the WSAN, is also responsible for: data sources identification,
    performing data validation, partitioning, and processing. The later includes running
    the irrigation algorithm for detecting whenever the plants need irrigation. Other
    functionalities comprise sending messages back to the WSAN nodes to activate or
    deactivate the irrigation system, and interfacing to 3rd party services. D. 3rd
    Party Services-Weather Station In a regular basis, the cloud platform gets weather
    information from a Weather Station regarding the region in which the WSAN is deployed.
    The Wunderground online weather service is used for providing this data in real-time.
    It allows the selection of the closest available weather station to the location
    where the WSAN is deployed. The data is fetched by a HTTP Request and is returned
    in JSON format. The data feature consists of the hourly forecast, which returns
    data such as high and low temperature, wind direction, humidity, PoP (Probability
    of Precipitation), among others, for the next 36 hours. The PoP parameter gives
    the chance or likelihood of precipitation to occur in a certain area. This parameter
    is essential to estimate the best irrigation periods. E. Irrigation Algorithm
    The irrigation algorithm (see Figure 3) uses two distinct pieces of information:
    the soil moisture measurements received from the WSAN nodes, and weather station
    forecasts. Fig. 3. Irrigation algorithm. Show All All the sensing nodes comprised
    in the WSAN send soil moisture measurements frequently. The algorithm uses them
    for taking decisions concerning the need for irrigation. The actuator nodes must
    receive a control message for start performing the irrigation. The sink node of
    the wireless sensor network continuously sends new measurements acquired by the
    sensor nodes. After processing, the received value is compared to a threshold
    value, to decide if the plant in which the sensor node is located needs water.
    If the plant does not need water (soil moisture measurement above a threshold),
    the platform waits for the next measurement in order to double-check if there
    is a need for irrigation. Otherwise, whenever a soil moisture message of any node
    has a value below the defined threshold, the service will check for the weather
    forecast for the next 6 hours to decide whether to irrigate. During imminent raining
    periods, the irrigation should not be performed. Hence, if in the next 6 hours
    the probability of precipitation is higher than 50%, the system will not irrigate.
    Otherwise, the cloud sends a control message to the WSAN to activate irrigation
    in the targeted area. The end of irrigation is triggered whenever network soil
    moisture sensors assume a soil moisture value higher than the defined field capacity
    point. If this condition is satisfied, the cloud sends a message to the WSAN with
    an instruction to stop irrigation. F. Web Application The web application provides
    a User Interface (UI) based on Model-View-Controller software architecture. The
    communication between the UI and the Machinates platform is performed under JSON
    over REST. The UI (see Figure 4) allows the user to visualize the location of
    the network nodes, to access historical data related both to soil moisture and
    battery measurements for each sensor, as well as PoP predictions. For the AP device
    there is a battery indicator in the main page. which shows the battery level of
    that device. Fig. 4. UI dashboard (partial view). Show All SECTION IV. Experimental
    Evaluation The system was deployed in a real case scenario, a local farm located
    near Sortelha (Guarda, Portugal). For these evaluation tests a row of 9 peach
    trees were available for testing the system, in which the devices were distributed.
    The irrigation system initially comprised a manually scheduled drip irrigation
    system. The farm owner proceeded with the manual irrigation based on observation
    of the soil, the cultures itself, as well as the observed meteorological conditions.
    The farms fields contain a large number of different trees cultures and all these
    cultures were irrigated through the same irrigation system. On the drip irrigation
    tubing, the distance between each emitter is one meter. As the spacing between
    the trees was approximately 3 meters, it was possible to place the emitters right
    near the trees stalk and above the roots. A set of drip emitter tubing connected
    with each other was used in the property. The tubing beginning was connected to
    the public water supply. The irrigation would take place once the water tap was
    manually opened. The area comprising the row of the peach trees was isolated from
    the other irrigation systems. It was deployed an individual independent irrigation
    system for evaluating the proposed system, applied to the aforementioned 9 peach
    trees. Fig. 5. Distances between each network device. Show All The field tests
    involved the use of four devices: one Access Point, and 3 soil moisture sensors,
    connected to two End Devices and one Range Extender, following a cluster-tree
    topology. One drip irrigation tube covers the entire row of peach trees. One Electrovalve
    is used as actuator, controlled by the AP device. One entry of the Electrovalve
    is connected to the public water supply, and the other one is connected to the
    abovementioned drip irrigation tubing. The approximate distance between each peach
    tree is 3 meters. The distance between each device is depicted accordingly in
    Figure 5. A. Experimental Methodology The soil moisture sensors were placed within
    the tree roots about 15 to 20 cm in depth as pictured in Figure 6a. It is fundamental
    that the readings are taken at the roots zone. In this zone the plants absorb
    the needed water and nutrients for their healthy growth. Furthermore, this location
    enables more accurate readings, because the soil moisture sensor is less affected
    by external conditions such as the sunlight. Each soil sensor is connected to
    an ED/RE device node, fixed to the tree trunk about 1 meter above the soil (as
    shown in Figure 7). This location is due to soil attenuation, diffraction and
    reflection conditions, which may affect the signals transmission. Fig. 6. a) soil
    moisture sensor placement. b) electrovalve placement. Show All Fig. 7. ED/RE device
    with an attached soil moisture sensor. Show All The electrovalve (Figure 6b) is
    either opened or closed according to AP commands, and controls the water passage
    to the drip irrigation tubing covering the entire row of trees. The devices containing
    soil moisture sensors were configured to perform soil moisture readings every
    30 minutes during non-irrigation periods and every 5 minutes in irrigation periods.
    The battery sampling frequency of each device was configured to 60mins. The AP
    device sends measurement data to the cloud platform every time the packets buffer
    reaches 4 or more packets, or whenever the time spent since the last data transmission
    exceeds 60mins. It was defined a threshold with the value of 400 and a field capacity
    point with a value of 700. The nearest weather station from the experiments location
    was located in Belmonte, within a distance of nearly 10km. B. Results Analysis
    Evaluation tests were realized for three consecutive days, in Summer time. Figure
    8 reports the registered soil moisture variations during experimental tests for
    all the sensors. Fig. 8. Soil moisture rmeasurements by the three devices. Show
    All As the system started operation, the sensors initiated the soil moisture readings
    with values comprised between 500 and 600. From here on the soil moisture readings
    were slowly decreasing to a point whereas there was the need of irrigation (approximately
    15 hours after the system started operating). As the soil moisture sensors were
    placed about 15 to 20 cm below ground, and also due to the utilized irrigation
    system, the variations of the soil moisture sensors were relatively slow, due
    to the time the water needed to penetrate into the soil and reach the soil moisture
    sensors. The irrigation system was enabled during approximately 50mins, the time
    instant all the soil moisture sensors acquired soil moisture readings above the
    defined field capacity point. Even though the field capacity point had the value
    of 700, this value was highly exceeded by all soil moisture sensors. This may
    be due to the fact that even after the irrigation system was stopped, the water
    took more time to infiltrate into the soil, which made the soil moisture readings
    rise up almost until the value of 800, value exceeded by End Device 1. This shows
    that the system should be configured with a lower field capacity point, taking
    into account the time the water takes to infiltrate in the soil. A future study
    of the soil type would be important to adapt the field capacity point to the soil
    type. Once soil moisture readings of the RE device reached values below the defined
    threshold, the probability of precipitation acquired from the weather station
    was below 50% for the next 6 hours (no probability of precipitation for the next
    6 hours) and so the irrigation system had to be activated in order to apply the
    needed irrigation. During these experimental tests, the farms owner manually irrigated
    the other remaining fields once a day, with a duration of approximately one hour.
    If our system were not deployed, the peach trees used in our tests would be irrigated
    following the same scheme as the other remaining fields, i.e., these fields would
    be irrigated 3 times in a period of 3 days with a total of 3 hours of irrigation.
    Using our system the field was only irrigated once during a period of approximately
    50 minutes, evidencing that the other fields were suffering from over irrigation
    and smart irrigation allowed water savings. Indeed, each dripper comprised in
    the drip irrigation tubing issues approximately 2,3 liters per hour. The total
    amount of water issued by the 9 drippers on the 9 trees during the irrigation
    of 50mins is approximately 17,25 liters. Without the use of our system, with a
    total of 3 hours, the water used would be approximately 62,1 liters. Our system
    used about 72% less water than the typical manual irrigation process. C. Communication
    and Processing Latency The time between the measurements acquisition and the time
    the measurements arrives at the cloud platform is variable. After sending a set
    of messages to the cloud, the next measurement stored in buffer will remain there
    until 3 more messages arrive. This way, this first message will have a greater
    delay time relatively to the next 3 messages. The last message received at the
    AP device (before the sending process is started) has the lowest delay time since
    acquisition. The processing times for all messages at the cloud platform are all
    similar. These statistics (Figure 9) take into consideration the measurements
    received in each hour in a 12 hour time interval. Fig. 9. Mean values and standard
    deviation of the communication and processing latencies for each hour of operation.
    Show All The mean value of the Communication Time for all the operational hours
    was 443 seconds (7,38mins). In both periods of analysis, concerning hour 12th
    and 13th, the mean value of the communication time is lower than for the remaining
    periods, because during this time period the irrigation system was turned on and
    so the soil moisture measurements were taken each 5 minutes. Hence, the AP device
    sends more often messages in these two periods given that the buffer reaches faster
    the predefined value. Standard deviation values are high; some close to the correspondent
    mean value. This is expected since the time between acquisition and the instant
    the message is received by the cloud platform is not the same for every message.
    The message with the largest/lowest communication delay took about 31,3mins /
    1,25mins, respectively. Hence, the communication delay is dependent on the measurements
    sampling frequency; a higher frequency implies the buffer gets full more rapidly,
    and hence a smaller transmission delay. The processing time at the cloud was low,
    never exceeding 6secs. There is no statistically significant difference between
    the periods when the cloud platform received more messages (in irrigation periods)
    and the remaining periods of analysis. Fig. 10. Arriving times between periods
    of irrigation and non irrigation. Show All To further investigate the impact of
    sampling rate on communication delays, lets compare 20 continuous samplings for
    each case (irrigation and non irrigation) of soil moisture measurements (results
    shown in Figure 10). As expected, message communication delay during irrigation
    periods is smaller. The mean value for irrigation periods was 3,08 mins, whereas
    it was ∼7,61 mins for non-irrigation. SECTION V. Conclusions The development of
    a system for smart irrigation can greatly benefit from the knowledge of the soil
    and water dynamics. A comprehensive study of such topics was performed which allowed
    the authors to have a clearer vision of the plants water needs. This information
    was then employed for the development of the proposed solution. Besides the soil
    moisture monitoring, to assess the plants water needs for its proper and healthy
    development, it was also important to assess the possibility of natural resources''
    usage optimization. In this context it was introduced the integration of weather
    forecast parameters to optimize the usage of natural resources. Experimental tests
    on a real case scenario at a farm allowed the identification of some limitations,
    mainly related to energy consumption. The current scheme, although significantly
    better than the initial prototypes based on Arduino hardware, is not able to last
    as long as it was desirable. In addition, there is the need to have a better comprehension
    of the distinct soil types, the distinct cultures and irrigation methods applied.
    These factors influence the optimization of the water savings. The collaboration
    with a soil and cultures expert would be important to better assess the soil water
    needs and improve the smart irrigation algorithm. In addition, the inclusion of
    other parameters coming from the weather forecast reports would potentially benefit
    the irrigation performance in water savings. Ongoing developments address the
    storage of historical information on the cloud concerning an agriculture field.
    The availability of a large amount of valuable data on the cloud enables the creation
    of intelligent services with very high potential, such as data correlation between
    different cultures and/or fields, plant disease estimation through the application
    of machine learning techniques, or determination of the most appropriate land
    cultivation according to soil conditions. Authors Figures References Citations

    Abstract: Agriculture 5.0 refers to the next phase of agricultural development,
    building upon the

    previous digital revolution in the agrarian sector and aiming to transform the
    agricultural industry

    to be smarter, more effective, and ecologically conscious. Farming processes have
    already started

    becoming more efﬁcient due to the development of digital technologies, including
    big data, artiﬁcial

    intelligence (AI), robotics, the Internet of Things (IoT), and virtual and augmented
    reality. Farmers

    can make the most of the resources at their disposal thanks to this data-driven
    approach, allowing

    them to effectively cultivate and sustain crops on arable land. The European Union
    (EU) aims to

    make food systems fair, healthy, and environmentally sustainable through the Green
    Deal and its

    farm-to-fork, soil, and biodiversity strategies, zero pollution action plan, and
    upcoming sustainable

    use of pesticides regulation. Many of the historical synthetic pesticides are
    not currently registered

    in the EU market. In addition, the continuous use of a limited number of active
    ingredients with

    the same mode of action scales up pests/pathogens/weed resistance potential. Increasing
    plant

    protection challenges as well as having fewer chemical pesticides to apply require
    innovation and

    smart solutions for crop production. Biopesticides tend to pose fewer risks to
    human health and the

    environment, their efﬁcacy depends on various factors that cannot be controlled
    through traditional

    application strategies. This paper aims to disclose the contribution of robotic
    systems in Agriculture

    5.0 ecosystems, highlighting both the challenges and limitations of this technology.
    Speciﬁcally, this

    work documents current threats to agriculture (climate change, invasive pests,
    diseases, and costs)

    and how robotics and AI can act as countermeasures to deal with such threats.
    Finally, speciﬁc case

    studies and the application of intelligent robotic systems to them are analyzed,
    and the architecture

    for our intelligent decision system is proposed.

    1. Introduction

    Agriculture 5.0 constitutes an entire ecosystem; it aims to integrate emerging
    technolo-

    gies, such as AI, IoT, and ML in agriculture, to improve productivity while promoting
    sus-

    tainability and decision-making processes. Enhancing traditional farming practices
    through

    automation and scalable technology solutions is meant to reduce risks, enhance
    sustain-

    ability, and provide predictive decision-making for growers [1,2]. Moreover, data-driven

    agriculture and advanced farm management systems are becoming increasingly important

    in the contemporary agrarian sector. Smart agriculture relies on objective information

    acquired through sensors to make optimal decisions and maximize productivity while

    ensuring resource efﬁciency and environmental sustainability. By incorporating
    robotic

    solutions and AI techniques, data-driven agriculture lays the groundwork for sustainable

    agriculture in the future. In relation to Industry 5.0 (which emphasizes collaboration
    be-

    tween humans and intelligent machines, with a focus on resilience and sustainability),

    Agriculture 5.0 seeks to reconcile the need for sufﬁcient and affordable food
    production

    with the preservation of ecosystems. While Industry and Agriculture 4.0 focus
    mainly on

    technologies, like IoT and Big Data, Industry and Agriculture 5.0 add human, environmen-

    tal, and social aspects to the equation. The transition from the digital farming
    revolution to

    Agriculture 5.0 is considered critical for the future well-being of farmers and
    the gradual

    shift to efﬁcient, intelligent, and autonomous farms in terms of energy consumption.
    In-

    tegrating emerging technologies and alternative energy sources into Agriculture
    5.0 can

    provide cost-effective access to ﬁnance, weather updates, remote monitoring, and
    future

    energy solutions for smart farm installations.

    According to the European Agricultural Industry (EU-27), the growing demands on

    agricultural products as well as the growing world population have raised the
    demand

    for an increased production yield. Note that agriculture possesses strong links
    with food

    processing and farm machinery sectors. The latter is directly affected by the
    performance

    of the agrarian sector; thus, the total economic impact of agriculture is multiplied
    [3].

    More speciﬁcally, the global population increase and the consecutive exponential
    one in

    food demand have led to a search for more efﬁcient ways of production, both in
    terms

    of production size and quality of products. Speciﬁcally, the above reasons caused
    the

    Third Agricultural Revolution to ﬂourish by introducing vital technological pillars
    in the

    agricultural ﬁeld. The mentioned stations are: (i) the selective breeding to improve
    the

    quality of food in products for humans and animals as well as (ii) the use of
    chemical fertil-

    izers and synthetic pesticides for increased quality production with a low environmental

    footprint. Chemical pesticides used to protect crops from pests, pathogens, and
    weeds pose

    acute and long-term risks to humans and other non-target organisms [4]. Moreover,
    many

    pesticides and their degradation products persist in the environment for many
    years [5].

    The farm-to-fork, soil, and biodiversity strategies, as well as the zero pollution
    action

    plan, include ambitious and speciﬁc targets on pesticides, fertilizers, biological
    agriculture,

    and resistance development against pesticides (https://ec.europa.eu/info/food-farming-

    ﬁsheries/sustainability/environmental-sustainability/cap-andenvironment_en (accessed

    on 1 April 2023)) [6]. Some clear targets to be achieved by 2030 are to reduce
    chemicals

    and more hazardous pesticides by 50%, reduce fertilizer use by 20%, and enhance
    the

    organic farming sector by 25% of total farmland (https://ec.europa.eu/info/food-farming-

    ﬁsheries/farming/organic-farming/organic-production-and-products_en (accessed
    on

    1 April 2023)). New technological advances must be introduced in traditional agricultural

    systems to support those EU targets. Hence, process automation can be a modern
    way

    of handling this situation. The high-tech precision agriculture systems result
    from the

    research and development of interdisciplinary teams in mechatronics and agronomy
    [7].

    In this context, various vehicles have been developed, which are capable of moving
    in

    difﬁcult rural terrains, while the development of drones has given new impetus
    to several

    applications, such as crop health assessment, plant monitoring, etc. These developments

    allow modern mechatronic systems to collect data, communicate wirelessly, and
    share

    large sizes of data between them [8,9]. The above data constitute a cornerstone
    of precision

    farming since they can be used for timely and accurate spraying of fungicides,
    insecticides

    and herbicides, fruit harvesting when appropriate for ripening, etc. This enables
    intelligent

    cultivation, production automation, and production automation, saving farmers’
    time in

    various stages of production, such as sowing, spraying, harvesting, etc. At the
    same time,

    farmers have the ability to control their processes and results through communication

    technology [10]. The evolution of modern robots has an impact on improving the
    quality of

    crops by increasing both the proﬁtability of producers as well as the choice-consumption

    of quality food [11]. Therefore, the implementation of new technologies helps
    to restrict

    dosing and dispersal, thereby reducing the environmental consequences. However,
    inde-

    pendent of their targeted operational environment, contemporary robots should
    be smart

    and, thus, retain advanced perception abilities [12,13]. These capabilities are
    highly related

    to how the robots understand, interpret, and represent their environment and its
    elements

    (such as crops, leaves, etc.), and each individual productive entity (e.g., plants,
    trees, pests,

    Machines 2023, 11, 774

    3 of 15

    pathogens, etc.). Semantic mapping is salutary and can provide viable solutions
    to related

    problems [14]. Also, the heterogeneous data extracted from an integrated system
    are neces-

    sary to be understandable and useful for the direct actions of the producers/farmers
    or for

    the direct supply to another robot system that implements the next action (for
    example,

    spraying, collecting fruit, etc.). The above challenges involve system advancements
    in

    terms of dependability and semantic perception abilities with the ultimate requirement
    of

    being operable in different environments.

    Crop protection constitutes a major food production component. Using cutting-edge

    technologies such as the introduction of low-risk pesticides, precision farming,
    and genome

    editing will help to keep modern agriculture sustainable. Timely monitoring of
    crop

    protection problems and targeted application of the ﬁt-for-purpose pesticide would
    reduce

    the overall risk and increase the efﬁcacy of each application. Speciﬁcally, our
    proposed

    system will contribute to improving crop protection by making it more efﬁcient
    and robust.

    The main contributions of our work are summarized as follows:

    •

    To summarize the most recent and relevant literature in the domain of smart farming

    through robots.

    •

    To highlight and stress the beneﬁts of introducing an autonomous robotic ecosystem
    in

    the agricultural ﬁeld.

    •

    To reveal the technological challenges and barriers to introducing such solutions
    in

    this domain.

    •

    To propose a conceptual framework for the realization of robotized systems in
    agricul-

    tural environments to help with their protection.

    •

    To explore potential improvements in pesticide efﬁcacy by providing timely pesticide

    delivery to targets.

    •

    To investigate strategies for reducing the risk posed by pesticide applications
    to non-

    target organisms.

    •

    To discuss the development of a decision support system for selecting low-risk
    pesticides

    among the available options.

    The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Firstly, the crop justiﬁcation
    is analyzed

    in Section 2. In Section 3, we discuss related works in the ﬁeld of precision
    agriculture.

    In the same section, the problem formulation is also presented. Section 4 describes
    the

    agriculture ﬁeld requirements, and the next section highlights the beneﬁts of
    utilizing AI

    methods. In Section 5, we analyze the proposed system and its architecture. In
    Section 6, a

    discussion of our ﬁndings is provided, while in Section 7, our conclusions are
    drawn and

    plans for future work are presented.

    2. Crop Justiﬁcation

    Two important crops for the EU economy were selected as case studies. A ﬁeld crop

    (wheat) and a perennial crop (olive) constitute our models, covering different
    (i) crop-

    ping systems, (ii) pest/weed/pathogen severity, and (iii) registered pesticides.
    The olive

    tree (Olea europea L.) is a universal tree that has accompanied Mediterranean
    agriculture

    for thousands of years. Nowadays, over 750 million olive trees are cultivated
    world-

    wide, 95% of which are in the Mediterranean region. The fruit, oil, and branches
    of

    olive trees have been culturally and economically tightly linked with Mediterranean
    his-

    tory (https://agriculture.ec.europa.eu/news/producing-69-worlds-production-eu-largest-

    producer-olive-oil-2020-02-04_en (accessed on 20 April 2023)). About 98% of olive
    oil

    and 80% of table olive production are from Mediterranean countries. Approximately

    70% of the world’s olive oil production is concentrated in Europe. In the EU,
    olive tree

    plantations are found in nine EU Member States: Spain, Italy, Greece, Portugal,
    Cyprus,

    France, Croatia, Slovenia, and Malta. EU olive production reached 10,908,000 tonnes

    and EUR 2255 million in 2016 [15]. The average annual olive yield and product
    qual-

    ity varied between years, reﬂecting the effect of plant protection problems. The
    olive

    tree is a long-living drought-tolerant species that is limited by many biotic
    stressors (e.g.,

    pests, diseases, and weeds). Bactrocera oleae, Prays oleae, Euphyllura spp., Saissetia
    oleae,

    Machines 2023, 11, 774

    4 of 15

    Parlatoria oleae, and Eriophyidae mites are the most important pests and Cycloconium
    oleag-

    inum, Glomerella cingulata, Pseudomonas syringae pv. savastanoi are among the
    diseases receiv-

    ing chemical control by various pesticides. In the EU, olive cultivation tends
    to move from

    traditional low-density systems to new, high-density, super-intensive cropping
    systems.

    All of these changes have affected the incidence and severity of pests and diseases.
    In olive

    trees, at least ten of the currently registered pesticides, one insecticide (lambda-Cyhalothrin),

    seven fungicides (Bordeaux mixture, copper hydroxide, copper oxide, copper oxychloride,

    Difenoconazole, Tebuconazole, Tribasic copper sulfate), and two herbicides (Diﬂufenican,

    Metribuzin) are listed as candidates for substitution. Copper products are used
    in high

    quantities and most alternatives lack copper efﬁcacy. Moreover, the limited number
    of

    pesticides registered for use in olives has resulted in resistance development
    to most pests,

    diseases, and weeds against insecticides, fungicides, and herbicides, respectively.
    Table 1

    summarizes the currently registered pesticides in olive trees. Cereal grains have
    numerous

    uses, such as bread, semolina, and pasta; they are also important components of
    animal

    feed and serve as raw material in the production of products such as alcohol,
    beer, starch,

    and dextrin, and are used in the glucose industry. In the EU, the cereal sector
    accounted

    for approximately 11% of the total output value of agricultural production in
    2016 and it

    is an important sector in the northern member states (https://www.europarl.europa.eu/

    RegData/etudes/BRIE/2019/640143/EPRS_BRI(2019)640143_EN.pdf (accessed on 1 April

    2023)). The EU cereal sector is facing structural, ﬁnancial, and climatic challenges.
    Russia’s

    war against Ukraine has put global food security at risk and has contributed signiﬁcantly

    to the growing wheat and wheat ﬂour prices. Around one-third of the EU’s cereal
    imports

    in 2021 came from Ukraine and Russia; following the war, the EU had to undertake
    all

    measures to certify EU cereal production. Wheat, the most important cereal crop
    cultivated

    worldwide, is used to prepare bread for approximately 40% of the global population
    [16].

    Wheat is an important commodity in Europe, with a production of 133 million tonnes
    per

    year. Wheat production depends on numerous production factors, and the use of
    pesti-

    cides is important for increasing the quantity and quality of wheat production.
    Pesticides

    help to control pests and diseases or their vectors, as well as reduce spoilage
    during stor-

    age. Broadleaf and grassy weeds, diseases (Puccinia striiformis/graminis/recondita,
    Erysiphe

    graminis, Septoria tritici/nodorum, Fusarium spp. Tilletia caries, Ustilago nuda,
    Ustilago spp.,

    Rhizoctonia spp.), insects (Agrotis spp., Rhopalosiphum padi, Sitobion avenae,
    Limothrips cere-

    alium), and other pests can reduce wheat crop yields, and the use of pesticides
    helps to

    minimize these losses. In the early stages of crop development, using herbicides
    to con-

    trol weed infestations is essential for achieving optimal grain yield and desired
    economic

    beneﬁts. With wheat, at least two insecticides (Cypermethrin, lambda-Cyhalothrin),
    one

    fungicide (Tebuconazole), and two herbicides (Pendimethalin, Metsulfuron-methyl)
    from

    the current authorized products are listed as candidates for substitution. Wheat
    production

    is also threatened by the development of weed resistance against most registered
    herbicides,

    and there are numerous instances of insects and fungi developing resistance against
    insecti-

    cides and fungicides, respectively. While the investigation into less harmful
    compounds

    to substitute undesirable pesticides is an important strategy, other promising
    smart farm-

    ing technologies (innovative formulations), tools (innovative spraying equipment),
    and

    methodologies (lower dosages) can contribute to increased pesticide efﬁcacy and
    reduced

    impact on the environment and human health. Table 2 summarizes the currently registered

    pesticides in wheat. AI can help in the selection of the most appropriate pesticides
    in order

    to achieve the highest efﬁciency against targeted crop protection problems and
    the lowest

    risks for resistance development and hazards related to non-target organisms.
    The mode of

    action of pesticides, the life cycle and susceptibility of pests/pathogens/weeds,
    stability,

    leaching and runoff potential, environmental conditions, and availability of application

    technologies are among the major factors that an AI system can be trained to handle.

    3. Related Works

    This section presents the existing knowledge related to the research topic and
    provides

    an overview of the relevant literature. The purpose of this section is to contextualize
    the

    Machines 2023, 11, 774

    6 of 15

    research of the ﬁeld’s current state. Through a comprehensive review of related
    works,

    gaps in the research can be identiﬁed, providing a rationale for our study. This
    section also

    allows readers to situate the research within a broader scholarly conversation
    and provides

    a foundation for the argument presented in the paper.

    The importance of crop area (CA) protection can be attributed to the growing pop-

    ulation. Automatic mapping using information extracted from high-spatial resolution

    remote sensing (RS) images is powerful for acquiring accurate and up-to-date CA
    maps.

    RS image information extraction includes feature classiﬁcation, which is a long-standing

    research issue in the RS community [13]. Emerging deep learning techniques, such
    as the

    deep semantic segmentation network technique, are effective methods to automatically

    discover relevant contextual features and obtain better image classiﬁcation results
    [17].

    More speciﬁcally, several studies have dealt with agricultural precision sectors,
    contributing

    to increased agricultural yields. Note that the authors of [18] applied transfer
    learning

    to domain adaptation—from the source domain to the plant domain—by using a major

    category in the plant domain. Category adaptation was performed from the major
    to minor

    categories within the plant domain. UAVs are immediately accessible tools for
    remote sens-

    ing scientists and farmers. In recent years, small commercial UAVs (<50 kg) [19]
    have been

    available for environmental and agricultural applications. Much of the research
    on preci-

    sion agriculture for conservation has focused on strategically placing conservation
    areas to

    minimize runoff contaminants (e.g., sediment, nutrients, and pesticides) and,
    subsequently,

    increasing water quality [20]. The approach in [21] stated that spatial variability
    in soil,

    crops, and topographic characteristics, combined with temporal variability between
    sea-

    sons, could lead to variable annual yield patterns. The complexity of interactions
    between

    yield-limiting factors, such as soil nutrients and soil water, requires specialized
    statistical

    processing to quantify convenience and, thus, inform crop management practices.
    This

    study used multiple linear regression models, cubic regression, and neural propagation

    networks to predict performance.

    Generally, the advent of AI and robotized solutions have revolutionized crop protection

    by offering advanced capabilities and precision in addressing agricultural challenges.
    These

    technologies enable automated monitoring, early detection of pests and diseases,
    targeted

    application of treatments, and efficient resource management, leading to increased
    crop

    yields and sustainable farming practices. Semantic recognition plays a crucial
    role in crop

    protection by enabling the identification and classification of pests, diseases,
    and other threats

    to agricultural crops [13,14]. Through advanced algorithms and machine learning
    techniques,

    semantic recognition systems can accurately analyze images, sensor data, and other
    inputs to

    provide timely and targeted interventions, leading to improved crop health and
    yield [22,23].

    In recent years, different machine learning techniques have been implemented to
    achieve

    accurate yield prediction for different crops. The most successful techniques
    used support

    vector regression [24], M5-Prime regression trees [25], and k-nearest neighbor
    [26]. The authors

    created the spiking neural network (SNN) model for timely crop yield prediction.
    The above

    approach [27] introduces SNN as a promising technique for spatiotemporal data
    modeling

    and crop analysis prediction. Because deep learning techniques have the capability
    to extract

    feature maps from data for estimation, they can be expected to have less dependency
    on

    the input data. Even in rural areas where data acquisition is limited, deep learning
    can be

    expected to provide good crop yield estimation [28].

    In [29], the obstacles faced in implementing smart agri-robotic solutions for
    global

    broadacre crop production were analyzed. The authors argued that the current strategies

    and technologies used in agri-robotics are insufﬁcient to address the unique complexities

    associated with large-scale crop farming. They identify several key challenges,
    including

    the unpredictable nature of diverse broadacre crops, the necessity for adaptable
    robotic

    systems, and the intricate decision-making processes involved in crop management.
    To

    overcome these challenges effectively, the authors proposed fundamentally rethinking

    existing approaches and technologies, like machine learning, computer vision,
    and sensor

    networks, as essential components of smart agri-robotic solutions. Furthermore,
    the authors

    Machines 2023, 11, 774

    7 of 15

    of [30] presented an in-depth analysis of the use of intelligent robot systems
    in the ﬁeld

    of ecological agriculture. The paper emphasized the signiﬁcance of adopting advanced

    technologies to address challenges related to pest control and promote sustainable
    farming

    practices. By integrating robotic platforms, sensors, imaging techniques, and
    artiﬁcial

    intelligence algorithms, the paper discussed how these technologies enable precise
    and

    targeted pest management strategies, reduce reliance on chemical pesticides, and
    minimize

    environmental impacts. The beneﬁts of intelligent robot plant protection systems,
    such

    as improved efﬁciency, reduced labor requirements, and enhanced crop yield, are
    high-

    lighted. The authors also acknowledge potential challenges in implementing these
    systems,

    including cost, scalability, and compatibility with existing agricultural practices.

    Subsequently, the approach in [31] provides a comprehensive summary of the role
    and

    impact of robotics, IoT, and AI in automating the agricultural sector. The review
    explores

    various applications of these advanced technologies, including automated harvesting,

    precision agriculture, crop monitoring, livestock management, and smart irrigation
    systems.

    It highlights how the integration of robotics, IoT, and AI can enhance efﬁciency,
    productivity,

    and sustainability in farming practices. The paper also emphasizes the importance
    of

    incorporating data analytics and machine learning algorithms for intelligent decision-

    making in agriculture. Finally, it addresses the challenges associated with implementing

    these technologies, such as cost, scalability, interoperability, and data privacy.

    Moreover, in [32], the authors presented a comprehensive overview of the integration
    of

    machine learning and emerging technologies in precision crop protection, specifically
    focusing

    on the transition towards Agriculture 5.0. Specifically, the paper explored the
    immense

    potential of these technologies to revolutionize farming practices, improve sustainability,

    and optimize crop protection strategies. By delving into various areas, such as
    machine

    learning algorithms, sensor technologies, remote sensing, IoT, and data analytics,
    the review

    examined how these technologies could be utilized to enhance crucial aspects of
    agriculture,

    including crop monitoring, pest detection, disease diagnosis, and targeted application
    of

    agrochemicals. The authors emphasized the significance of context-aware and data-driven

    decision-making to achieve precision crop protection in the evolving agricultural
    landscape.

    Then, it addressed pertinent issues, such as data quality, scalability, privacy
    concerns, and the

    need for interdisciplinary collaboration among researchers, farmers, and policymakers.
    By

    highlighting these challenges, this approach provides a holistic view of the potential
    barriers

    and considerations that need to be addressed for successful implementation.

    4. Analysis of Agriculture Field Requirements

    As the global population is projected to surpass 9 billion by 2050, the agricultural

    industry will have to satisfy the increasing demand for food. Pesticides will
    play a cru-

    cial role in ensuring high crop yields. Pesticides, according to the Food and
    Agriculture

    Organization (FAO), include substances of natural or synthetic chemicals or biological

    ingredients used to repel, destroy, or regulate pests and regulate plant growth.
    They help

    to protect seeds and crops from unwanted plants, insects, bacteria, fungi, and
    rodents, and

    come in various types, such as herbicides, insecticides, fungicides, rodenticides,
    and ne-

    maticides [33]. However, pesticides, herbicides, and chemicals have increased
    signiﬁcantly

    in recent years to manage plant diseases and increase crop productivity. This
    increases

    crop quantity, but it often lowers the quality, pollutes the land and groundwater,
    and

    poses several health risks, causing nearly 300,000 deaths worldwide each year.
    Early-stage

    disease detection using IoT-based solutions that deploy various sensors can help
    reduce

    the use of harmful chemicals. AI techniques, such as vision-based techniques using
    image

    processing, machine learning, and deep learning algorithms, have also been proposed
    for

    disease detection automation [34].

    In recent years, signiﬁcant advances have been made in the use of deep learning

    (DL) approaches to build high-performance AI models for plant disease detection.
    Some

    lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods show promise for
    use

    in IoT applications. Despite advancements in these vision-based methods, real-world

    Machines 2023, 11, 774

    8 of 15

    detection of plant diseases remains challenging due to complex backgrounds and
    varying

    environmental conditions. Crop monitoring through aerial/drone-based surveillance
    can

    be an alternative solution, but robust and reliable vision-based techniques are
    required to

    work for various crops. Expert knowledge and thorough training are required to
    recognize

    early symptoms of plant diseases and take timely action to prevent further spread
    [35].

    Plant diseases are classiﬁed into different categories, and visible symptoms are
    important

    in identifying diseases. Smart agriculture systems using AI methods for plant
    disease

    detection can be effective solutions to combat the problem of crop loss. There
    have been

    successful case studies in developing countries, but ﬁeld disease diagnosis in
    real time is

    still difﬁcult. Several models have been proposed to detect healthy and diseased
    leaves

    from various crops using CNN classiﬁcation techniques, achieving high accuracy
    [36].

    AI techniques for crop protection in agriculture have become increasingly prevalent

    in recent years, allowing for more efﬁcient and accurate identiﬁcation of pests,
    diseases,

    and soil deﬁciencies. AI sensors are now being utilized to identify and target
    weeds, with

    the appropriate herbicides then being applied to the speciﬁc area. In addition,
    integrating

    IoT sensors and supporting technologies, such as drones, geographic information
    systems

    (GISs), and other tools allow for real-time data monitoring, measurement, and
    storage.

    The aforementioned data can empower farmers by providing valuable insights into
    areas

    needing irrigation, fertilization, or pesticide treatment. This enables them to
    make well-

    informed decisions, effectively allocating resources and minimizing unnecessary
    expenses.

    Overall, incorporating AI techniques into agriculture use cases can lead to improved

    harvest quality, reduced herbicide usage, increased proﬁts, and signiﬁcant cost
    savings [35].

    Precision weed management is an efﬁcient tool to meet the EU targets for pesticide
    use

    reduction. In ﬁeld crops, like wheat, weed control is crucial to any plant protection

    scheme. Most of the proposed commercial technologies and prototypes for precision
    weed

    control consist of three essential elements (i) sensors for weed/crop detection,
    (ii) decision

    algorithms regarding the type of herbicides that would be the most efﬁcient, and
    (iii) a

    precise sprayer to deliver the appropriate dose of each herbicide to the targeted
    weed. Of

    the above-mentioned parts, inputs and validation of the decision algorithm are
    the most

    crucial for increasing the efﬁciency and reducing the risk of the applied herbicide
    [37].

    Saving herbicides by applying AI techniques in wheat depends on the location,
    stage, and

    distribution of the weeds [38]. The accuracy of the detected weeds could reach
    up to about

    99% [39]. Apart from weed management, scientiﬁc modeling has also been employed
    for

    forecasting in an IoT context involving fungal diseases in winter wheat [40].
    The recent

    progress in AI and automation have been applied to a machine-learning-based classiﬁcation

    approach to distinguish pests of tree crops, including the olive fruit ﬂy (Bactrocera
    oleae [41].

    In addition, online analytical processing models have been used to combine inputs
    in an

    integrated pest management scheme of olive tree crop protection [42].

    5. Beneﬁts of Utilizing AI Methods in Crop Protection

    The integration of robotics and artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) into agriculture has
    rev-

    olutionized the way crops are grown and protected. While the title “Sustainable
    Crop

    Protection via Robotics and Artiﬁcial Intelligence Solutions” suggests a focus
    on pest

    control, it is crucial to recognize that AI and robotics can contribute to comprehensive

    crop protection strategies. By leveraging these technologies, we can enhance agricultural

    practices and ensure a sustainable future for food production. While our primary
    focus

    lies in crop protection, speciﬁcally in the realms of weed and disease management,
    it is

    essential to acknowledge the broader scope of whole crop protection and monitoring.
    In

    this section, we aim to provide a concise overview of these additional components
    and

    highlight the invaluable contribution of AI solutions to these areas.

    Crop protection encompasses various factors beyond weeds and diseases that sig-

    niﬁcantly impact crop health and yield. Elements such as climate conditions, nutrition

    optimization, cultural activities, and plant physiology play crucial roles in
    ensuring com-

    Machines 2023, 11, 774

    9 of 15

    prehensive crop protection strategies. By leveraging AI solutions, we can unlock
    new

    possibilities and advancements in each of these areas.

    Climate adaptation and resilience: Climate change poses signiﬁcant challenges
    to

    agricultural productivity. AI and robotics can play pivotal roles in adapting
    and mitigating

    climate-related risks. Advanced algorithms can process vast amounts of climatic
    data,

    helping farmers make informed decisions about planting times, water usage, and
    crop

    selection. Robotics equipped with environmental sensors can monitor weather conditions,

    soil moisture levels, and pest outbreaks, providing real-time data to optimize
    crop manage-

    ment. With AI-driven climate modeling, farmers can anticipate weather patterns,
    allowing

    for timely adjustments and minimizing crop losses [32].

    Nutrition optimization: Achieving optimal crop nutrition is crucial for both yield
    and

    quality. AI and robotics can optimize nutrient management by analyzing soil composition,

    plant nutrient requirements, and growth patterns. Intelligent systems can monitor
    nutrient

    deﬁciencies or excesses, enabling precise application of fertilizers or other
    supplements.

    Additionally, robotics can automate tasks such as precision seeding, weeding,
    and nutrient

    delivery, minimizing waste and maximizing resource efﬁciency. By tailoring nutrition

    strategies to speciﬁc crop needs, AI and robotics contribute to sustainable agriculture
    while

    reducing environmental impacts [43].

    Cultural Activities and Labor Optimization: Agriculture encompasses a range of

    cultural activities that are essential for successful crop production. AI and
    robotics can

    automate and streamline various tasks, reducing labor-intensive efforts and optimizing

    resource allocation. For example, robotic systems can perform time-consuming activities

    such as harvesting, pruning, and sorting with greater accuracy and efﬁciency.
    By automat-

    ing repetitive tasks, farmers can focus on higher-value activities, such as crop
    planning,

    disease management, and market analysis. The integration of AI and robotics not
    only

    enhances productivity but also improves the quality of life for farmers, making
    agriculture

    a more attractive profession [44].

    Enhancing plant physiology and health: Understanding plant physiology is vital

    for effective crop protection. AI can analyze large datasets on plant physiology,
    growth

    patterns, and disease symptoms, enabling early detection and intervention. By
    analyzing

    the relationships between plant traits and environmental conditions, AI can develop
    models

    to predict plant stress and disease susceptibility. Robots equipped with cameras
    and sensors

    can precisely monitor plant health, detecting signs of nutrient deﬁciencies, water
    stress,

    or pest damage. This data-driven approach allows for proactive management strategies,

    reducing the reliance on reactive measures and promoting sustainable plant health
    [32].

    Furthermore, we outline some additional advantages of utilizing artiﬁcial intelligence

    (AI) methods in crop protection and agriculture as a whole. By enhancing precision
    agricul-

    ture, AI systems are improving the overall accuracy and quality of crop yields.
    Primarily,

    AI technology plays a role in detecting plant diseases, pests, and poor soil nutrition.
    Using

    AI-based sensors, weeds can be identiﬁed and targeted, and the appropriate herbicide

    can be applied in the area. Additionally, AI techniques allow for the collection
    of soil

    health data, fertilizer recommendations, weather monitoring, and tracking of the
    product’s

    readiness [45]. Hence, farmers are empowered to make informed decisions throughout
    the

    crop-growing process. Precision agriculture is a technique that incorporates the
    most efﬁ-

    cient soil management practices, variable rate technology, and optimal data management

    methods to help farmers enhance crop yields and minimize expenses. AI can offer
    real-time

    insights to farmers, allowing them to identify which areas require irrigation,
    fertilization,

    or pesticide treatment [46]. Additionally, innovative farming methods such as
    vertical

    agriculture can boost food production while minimizing resource usage. This approach

    reduces herbicide use, improves harvest quality, increases proﬁts, and has signiﬁcant
    cost

    savings. By employing IoT sensors and other supporting technologies, farmers can
    monitor,

    measure, and store ﬁeld data on various metrics in real time. Combining AI-based
    farming

    tools with IoT devices and software quickly provides farmers with more accurate
    informa-

    Machines 2023, 11, 774

    10 of 15

    tion. Having better data enables farmers to make more informed decisions, reducing
    the

    time and money spent on trial and error [47].

    6. Proposed Framework

    6.1. Background and Use Case Scenario

    Crop protection is an essential aspect of modern agriculture, and the use of fungicides,

    insecticides, and herbicides is common. However, the indiscriminate use of chemicals
    can

    lead to environmental damage and harmful effects on human health. An AI- and robotics-

    based crop protection system can provide a sustainable and efﬁcient solution to
    this prob-

    lem. The objective of this conceptual scenario is to develop an AI- and robotics-based
    crop

    protection system that minimizes the use of chemicals, chooses the most appropriate
    pesti-

    cide, and improves crop yield. The proposed methodology—as an example case—is
    applied

    to the agricultural crops colorof wheat and olive trees based on the following
    assumptions:

    (i) Major plant protection problems (pests/weeds/pathogens) of the selected crops
    (wheat

    and olive tree) have been identiﬁed (Tables 1 and 2). (ii) Registered insecticides,
    fungicides,

    and herbicides have been categorized as conventional, low-risk, and candidates
    for sub-

    stitution. It is also necessary to integrate the following: (iii) A decision support
    system

    regarding the selection of the most appropriate pesticide on an integrated pest
    management

    (IPM) system. (iv) Environmental factors affecting efﬁcacy and the environmental
    fate of

    pesticides. (v) Legislation and other policy information. The proposed crop protection

    scheme can be applied to environmentally sensitive cases (e.g., near protected
    surface- and

    ground-water bodies, sensitive non-target organisms, like bees, earthworms, and
    beneﬁcial

    microbes) or in cases of resistance to pesticides pests/pathogens/weeds.

    6.2. Concept

    The proposed concept incorporates a comprehensive and research-driven approach

    to revolutionize crop protection and enhance agricultural practices. A preliminary
    phase

    involves the creation of an extensive database that encompasses detailed information
    about

    various plant diseases, their corresponding pesticides, and the overall health
    status of plants.

    This database forms the foundation for accurately identifying the specific disease
    based

    on the symptoms exhibited by candidate plants. To ensure practical implementation,
    the

    system utilizes portable devices, such as smartphones or tablets, to provide farmers
    with

    images of diseased plants for disease recognition. In larger crop areas, a UAV
    equipped

    with visual sensors, capable of high or low-resolution imaging, can perform the
    disease- and

    pest-recognition process. Additionally, the system obtains georeferenced data
    on the examined

    plants, enabling the determination of potential disease spread to nearby crops
    within the area.

    Moreover, the system goes beyond disease identiﬁcation and extends its capabilities

    to identify weed species and distribute grassy and broadleaf weeds automatically.
    This

    information empowers the system to automatically employ AI to select the most
    appro-

    priate herbicide. In the future, selective spraying techniques utilizing UAVs
    could be

    implemented, provided that technological feasibility is achieved. This exciting
    prospect

    has the potential to revolutionize crop protection practices. The system also
    incorporates

    information on insect populations obtained from digital traps or other monitoring
    sys-

    tems. In the pesticide prioritization process, considerations regarding the pesticide
    risk to

    non-target organisms in wheat and olive agroecosystems can be considered. The
    system

    adapts to speciﬁc crop/pesticide combinations by incorporating pesticide cutoff
    criteria or

    dedicated authorization schemes aligned with national or regional legislation.

    Furthermore, the proposed system is designed to seamlessly communicate with other

    components of Agriculture 5.0. These include automatic watering functions, autonomous

    spraying robots, weather sensors, and software for optimizing spraying schedules,
    har-

    vesting, and other farming operations. By leveraging these interconnected components,

    the system aims to optimize farm protection, create a sustainable ecosystem, and
    foster a

    holistic approach to agriculture. The proposed framework is depicted in Figure
    1, highlight-

    ing the systematic ﬂowchart of the entire process. Its primary focus revolves
    around crop

    Machines 2023, 11, 774

    11 of 15

    protection, which is continuously threatened by weeds, pests, and diseases. Building
    upon

    this pipeline, the aim is to establish a digital ecosystem, termed the industrial
    metaverse

    (IM) digital world, which is capable of recording the complete life cycles of
    agricultural

    crops. This digital ecosystem will gather extensive information about the rural
    environment

    by leveraging IoT, virtual reality (including augmented reality capabilities),
    cloud and edge

    computing, and other features of Industry 5.0 (Agriculture 5.0), as depicted in
    Figure 2.

    Figure 1. A ﬂowchart of the crop protection system with AI and robotics techniques.

    Figure 2. High-level architecture of a crop protection system with AI and robotics
    techniques.

    Ultimately, the industrial metaverse comprises an explainable AI system that derives

    actionable results to improve production, environmental sustainability, and economic

    status. This comprehensive approach fosters communication across the supply-value
    chain,

    enhances responsiveness to potential issues, and improves safety, production efﬁciency,

    and environmental monitoring in real time. By leveraging the power of technology
    and

    research-driven methodologies, the proposed system aims to revolutionize agriculture
    and

    pave the way for a more sustainable and efﬁcient future.

    6.3. Architecture

    The methodology of the above-described system for improving crop protection is

    based on extensive research and aims to provide a convincing and actionable solution.

    The proposed architecture encompasses various data collection techniques and advanced

    Machines 2023, 11, 774

    12 of 15

    technologies, as illustrated in Figure 2. The agriculture ﬁeld’s digital transformation
    begins

    with IoT sensors for irrigation and weather monitoring. These sensors gather real-time
    data

    on soil moisture levels, temperature, humidity, and other relevant factors. Additionally,

    AI techniques are employed to recognize plant diseases based on visual cues and
    patterns,

    allowing for early detection and timely intervention. The production evolution
    aspect

    involves monitoring and analyzing crop growth and development over time.

    The AI- and robotics-based crop protection system comprises several modules that

    work in tandem to enhance agricultural practices:

    Data collection module: To generate valuable insights, the system collects data
    from

    diverse sources, including weather reports, soil sensors, satellite imagery, and
    digital insect

    traps. This comprehensive dataset enables accurate predictions of pest infestations,
    disease

    outbreaks, weed growth, and weather conditions.

    Machine learning model development and interpretation module: This module

    involves the creation of automated systems that process data and derive meaningful

    conclusions. The system provides clear and actionable insights to guide decision-making

    by interpreting results from machine learning models.

    Decision-making module: AI algorithms analyze the collected data and determine

    appropriate crop protection strategies. Factors considered include crop type,
    growth stage,

    severity of pests, weeds, or diseases, as well as environmental and risk assessment
    aspects

    related to pesticide use. Legislative limitations and the potential development
    of pesticide

    resistance are also taken into account.

    Robot module: The system can be integrated into autonomous robots equipped

    with sensors, cameras, and spraying equipment. Through the use of machine learning

    algorithms, these robots are trained to accurately identify and target pests,
    weeds, and

    diseases, optimizing the effectiveness of crop protection strategies.

    Monitoring module: AI is leveraged to monitor the effectiveness of crop protection

    strategies and make necessary adjustments in real time. This continuous monitoring

    ensures optimal performance and enables timely intervention when needed.

    User interface module: To facilitate communication between farmers, agricultural

    scientists, and other stakeholders, a user interface is provided. This interface
    presents the

    system’s ﬁndings and suggestions, allowing users to provide input and customize
    results

    according to their speciﬁc needs.

    The above system will have the modularity and agility to integrate other modules,
    for

    example, blockchain and NFT development platforms, with the aim of achieving the
    traceability

    of foods. The AI- and robotics-based crop protection systems hold immense potential
    to

    revolutionize crop protection practices while minimizing the detrimental impact
    of chemical

    use on the environment and human health. The system maximizes crop yields and
    promotes

    sustainable agricultural practices by enabling farmers to make informed decisions
    about

    their crop protection strategies. However, implementing this system requires extensive

    research and development to continually improve its efﬁciency and effectiveness.

    7. Discussion

    Crop protection is a critical aspect of agriculture that involves safeguarding
    crops

    against various threats, including pests, diseases, and weeds. Traditional crop
    protection

    methods involve using fungicides, insecticides, and herbicides, which can adversely
    affect

    the environment and human health. However, with the advent of robotics and artiﬁcial

    intelligence (AI), farmers now have new tools at their disposal to improve crop
    protection

    and increase yields. Robotic- and AI-based crop protection solutions involve using
    sensors,

    cameras, and machine learning algorithms to monitor crops and detect potential
    threats.

    These solutions offer several advantages over traditional methods, such as increased

    accuracy, efﬁciency, and cost-effectiveness. For example, robots equipped with
    sensors

    can detect pest infestations and apply targeted treatments only where necessary,
    reducing

    the number of chemicals used and minimizing the environmental impact. Furthermore,

    AI algorithms can analyze vast amounts of data on weather patterns, soil conditions,

    Machines 2023, 11, 774

    13 of 15

    and crop growth to predict potential threats and recommend preventive measures.
    This

    comprehensive approach enables farmers to make well-informed decisions regarding

    crop protection. It empowers them to effectively identify issues, choose the most
    suitable

    pesticide and application technology, and implement a reduced-risk crop protection
    scheme.

    Robotic- and AI-based solutions for crop protection also offer the potential for
    in-

    creased precision and automation, reducing the labor costs and time required for
    manual

    inspection and treatment. For example, drones equipped with cameras and sensors
    can

    survey large areas of crops quickly and efﬁciently, providing real-time data on
    crop health

    and potential threats. In addition, robotic- and AI-based solutions can provide
    farmers

    with real-time insights into the health and growth of their crops, enabling them
    to make

    more informed decisions and optimize crop management practices. For example, machine

    learning algorithms can analyze data on crop growth and identify patterns and
    trends

    that may not be immediately apparent to human observers. Despite the many advantages

    of robotic- and AI-based solutions for crop protection, some challenges still
    need to be

    addressed. For example, these solutions may require signiﬁcant investments in
    terms of

    hardware, software, and training. Additionally, there may be concerns about data
    privacy

    and security, particularly regarding sensitive information about crop yield and
    growth.

    In conclusion, robotic- and AI-based solutions have the potential to revolutionize
    crop

    protection and management, offering increased precision, efﬁciency, and cost-effectiveness.

    However, it will be essential to continue to develop these technologies and address
    any

    challenges to ensure that they are widely accessible to farmers and that they
    contribute to

    sustainable and ethical agriculture practices.

    8. Conclusions

    In conclusion, integrating robotic and artiﬁcial intelligence solutions into crop
    protec-

    tion is a promising avenue for addressing modern agriculture’s challenges. The
    potential ad-

    vantages of these technologies include increased precision, efﬁciency, and cost-effectiveness,

    as well as better monitoring and management of crop health. Looking to the future,
    several

    research areas could further enhance the effectiveness of these solutions. For
    example, the

    development of more advanced sensors and cameras, as well as improvements in machine

    learning algorithms, could enable more precise and accurate monitoring of crop
    health

    and growth. Additionally, advances in robotics could allow for more sophisticated
    and

    automated treatment of crops, reducing the need for manual labor. Another important
    area

    of future work is the integration of these technologies with existing agricultural
    practices

    and infrastructure, including relevant legislation, risk assessment, and environmental
    as-

    pects of AI modules. The availability of pesticide databases and alternative crop
    protection

    measures will help establish a robust machine learning model. This will require
    collabora-

    tion between farmers, agronomists, technology developers, and policymakers to
    ensure

    that the beneﬁts of these solutions are accessible to all and contribute to sustainable
    and

    ethical agriculture practices. Finally, addressing data privacy and security concerns
    will

    be essential, particularly regarding sensitive crop yield and growth information.
    This will

    require the development of robust data protection and governance frameworks and
    greater

    awareness among farmers and other stakeholders about the risks and beneﬁts of
    these

    technologies. Hence, the use of robotic and artiﬁcial intelligence solutions in
    crop protection

    has the potential to transform modern agriculture and ensure food security in
    the face of

    global challenges, such as climate change and population growth. Continued research

    and development in this area and integrating these technologies into existing
    agricultural

    practices will be crucial to realizing this potential and creating a more sustainable
    and

    resilient agricultural system for the future.

    \ (AI)\n1. Introduction\nPrecision agriculture (PA) is a management strategy for\
    \ addressing geographical\nand temporal variabilities in agricultural ﬁelds [1–3]\
    \ that involves data and contempo-\nrary technologies. With a forecasted human\
    \ population of between 9 and 10 billion by\n2050 [3–5], precision agriculture\
    \ is becoming more and more important to contemporary\nagricultural research.\
    \ By 2050, the amount of food produced worldwide must grow by at\nleast 70% [1,5–7].\
    \ This is a difﬁcult endeavor [4] because it puts further strain on already-\n\
    scarce resources and the environment [1–3]. Therefore, precision agriculture is\
    \ essential\nto maximize output while using fewer inputs of all sorts in more\
    \ effective ways, reducing\nadverse impacts on the environment, and assuring sustainability\
    \ [2,3]. Precision farming\nwas born with the introduction of GPSs (global positioning\
    \ systems), GISs (geographic in-\nformation systems), yield monitors, and other\
    \ data generators in all three crucial phases of\nagricultural operations in the\
    \ 1990s [2,8,9]. In precision agriculture, motorized equipment\nwas only used\
    \ for performing agricultural processes [2,10], and the problem-recognizing\n\
    and decision-making steps were authorized by humans. The technological advancement\n\
    during the Third Industrial Revolution, known as Industry 3.0 [8], led precision\
    \ agriculture\nto digitalization by integrating information technologies and improved\
    \ automation capa-\nbilities in precision farming. As a result of this digitalization,\
    \ “farm practices” with manual\ntools moved to “agriculture” from animal traction,\
    \ then to motorized mechanization, and\nnow to digital equipment [2].\nPrecision\
    \ agriculture so far mainly consists of variable rate technologies (VRTs), elec-\n\
    tronic maps, yield monitors, and guidance farming systems [2,8]. Variable rate\
    \ applications\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593. https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture13081593\n\

    were ﬁrstly demonstrated in northern Germany and Denmark in 1988 after global\
    \ posi-\ntioning systems (GPSs) were available for civil services [11]. GPS services\
    \ were opened\nfor general use in U.S. farms in 1983 [2]. In the next decade,\
    \ GPS technology facilitated\nfarmers to precisely locate and map their ﬁelds\
    \ [10,12], empowering them to manage their\nfarmlands according to site-speciﬁc\
    \ conditions and ﬁeld variabilities. At the beginning\nof the second millennium,\
    \ yield monitors were developed, enabling farmers to monitor\ncrop yield in real-time\
    \ via best matching [13]. Advancement of remote-sensing technology,\nsuch as satellites,\
    \ drones, ground-based sensors, and crews, authorized farmers to collect\nhigh-resolution\
    \ data on their ﬁelds, allowing them to make informed decisions about\ncrop management\
    \ [3]. Precision agriculture is not only focused on crop farming but also\non\
    \ other agricultural production systems: agronomics, livestock farming, aquaculture,\n\
    and agroforestry [2,3,9,14].\nIn the current status of precision agriculture,\
    \ there are several issues, such as un-\nsustainable resource utilization, long-term\
    \ monoculture, intensive animal farming [8],\nenvironmental compromises, uneven\
    \ distribution of digitization [15], food safety issues,\ninefﬁcient agri-food\
    \ supply chain [13,16], and lack of awareness of and inertia toward novel\nchanges.\
    \ These issues prevent achieving efﬁciency, productivity, and sustainability from\n\
    agricultural production and escalate unintended impacts on ecosystems [17]. The\
    \ fourth\nindustrial revolution, which is known as Industry 4.0, occurred in 2011\
    \ with the Internet of\nThings (IoT), big data, artiﬁcial intelligence (AI), robotics,\
    \ and blockchain technology [8,18].\nIn 2017, these advanced technologies were\
    \ integrated into agriculture in order to over-\ncome the above-mentioned issues,\
    \ transforming precision agriculture to Agriculture 4.0,\nor smart farming [8,16].\
    \ With this transition, there is a growing focus on sustainability\nin agriculture,\
    \ with many farmers adopting precision agricultural technologies to reduce\nthe\
    \ environmental impacts of farming and promote long-term sustainability. As a\
    \ result,\nagricultural-manufacturing processes and supply chains have become\
    \ more autonomous\nand intelligent [18], including the automation of various tasks\
    \ such as planting, seeding,\nharvesting, and soil sampling. This is making farming\
    \ more efﬁcient while reducing\nlabor costs.\nSmart agriculture is an evolving\
    \ ﬁeld that leverages technological innovations to\ntransform traditional farming\
    \ practices. The integration of digital technologies into agricul-\nture has opened\
    \ up new opportunities and possibilities, revolutionizing the way farmers\nmanage\
    \ their crops, resources, and operations. It is a rapidly evolving ﬁeld that encom-\n\
    passes a wide array of approaches, applications, and impacts. The broader objective\
    \ of\nthis review is to delve into the essential aspects of precision agriculture,\
    \ exploring its key\ncomponents and highlighting its potential for sustainable\
    \ farming practices. One of the\ncritical aspects of precision agriculture is\
    \ data collection and acquisition planning, which\nplays a fundamental role in\
    \ optimizing farm management decisions. Through efﬁcient data\ngathering, farmers\
    \ can make informed choices regarding crop health, resource allocation,\nand yield\
    \ optimization. Decision making and execution are also vital components of preci-\n\
    sion agriculture, where the integration of cutting-edge technologies is pivotal.\
    \ Leveraging\nmachine vision technology, the Internet of Things (IoT), and artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence (AI) can\nlead to enhanced precision and efﬁciency in agricultural\
    \ processes, beneﬁting both farmers\nand the environment. Throughout this review,\
    \ successful precision agriculture proposals\nand real-world implementations are\
    \ analyzed to gain insights into their achievements and\nchallenges. By identifying\
    \ future developments required in precision agriculture, we aim\nto provide a\
    \ comprehensive understanding of how this ﬁeld can continually evolve to\nsupport\
    \ sustainable farming practices and address global food security challenges. The\n\
    amalgamation of scientiﬁc research and technological innovations holds great promise\
    \ for\nthe future of precision agriculture and its positive impact on agriculture\
    \ and society as\na whole.\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n3 of 26\n2. Precision\
    \ Agriculture Approaches, Applications, and Impacts\nPrecision agriculture involves\
    \ data-driven management decisions that improve re-\nsource use efﬁciency, resulting\
    \ in reduced agricultural costs while lowering the environ-\nmental impacts from\
    \ agriculture [19]. Hence, data and data collection systems, decision\nsupport\
    \ tools, and data-driven equipment and input adjustments are major components\n\
    of precision agriculture [2], engaging in three key agricultural steps: diagnosis,\
    \ decision\nmaking, and performing [20], respectively. Before the integration\
    \ of smart technologies,\nICT (information and communication technology) was incorporated\
    \ into agricultural de-\nvices and machinery to capture real data. Here, remote\
    \ sensing, automated hardware and\nsoftware, telematics, drones, autonomous vehicles,\
    \ GPSs, and robotic technologies were\nincorporated into agricultural practices.\
    \ As an example, the agro-tech company John Deere\nintroduced GPSs for tractors,\
    \ expecting increased yield and decreased input wastage [19].\nThe previous status\
    \ of precision agriculture before smart farming can be summarized\nas follows.\n\
    2.1. Data Collection and Acquisition\nData, data collection, and decision support\
    \ tools are important for the identiﬁcation\nand diagnosis of various aspects\
    \ in agriculture. In precision agriculture, data on individual\nﬁelds and crops\
    \ are gathered by observing, measuring, and sensing with different kinds of\n\
    sensors, yield and soil monitors, and remote-sensing tools, such as imaging from\
    \ drones,\ncrews, aircraft, or satellites [1–3,13]. Thus, “sensing” is a fundamental\
    \ management tool\nof precision agriculture [3,13], which is observing detailed\
    \ information and providing\ndata on climate conditions, soil conditions, fertilizer\
    \ requirements, water availability, pest\nand disease stresses, and other ﬁeld\
    \ parameters [3]. A range of sensors are used in preci-\nsion agriculture. Biomass\
    \ parameters are important in making decisions to monitor the\nfertilization and\
    \ caring for crops. Sensors for mass ﬂow and moisture content are com-\nponents\
    \ of yield monitors, together with a differential global positioning system (DGPS)\n\
    receiver. Properly calibrated yield monitors can generate accurate real-time information\
    \ for\ndecision making, such as underperforming areas leading to site-speciﬁc\
    \ crop fertilization\ndesigns [13]. Precision livestock farming uses sensors and\
    \ monitoring technology to collect\ndata on animal health and welfare, enabling\
    \ farmers to make informed decisions about\nfeed, waste, and other inputs with\
    \ improved efﬁciency and productivity. Colter position\nsensors combined with\
    \ ultrasonic soil surface sensors are employed in dynamic Colter\ndepth control\
    \ systems [3].\nRemote-sensing technologies, such as drones, crews, aircraft,\
    \ satellites, and other\nground-based sensors, are used to collect data on crops\
    \ and soil conditions [2,3]. Remote\nsensing supports the identiﬁcation of spatial\
    \ patterns of signatures of plants that are co-\nincidental with soil characteristics,\
    \ as well as pest or disease stresses [11]. Imagery is one\nkind of remote-sensing\
    \ data that can reveal ground truthing [2,3,11]. Previously, aircraft\nhave been\
    \ used not only for many farming imagery operations that generate data, but also\n\
    chemical- or fertilizer-spraying activities. Moreover, satellite images have been\
    \ available for\nfarm management for many years. As an example, the US-LANDSAT\
    \ satellites were avail-\nable for this purpose in 1970 [2]. Unmanned aerial vehicles\
    \ (UAVs) equipped with global\nnavigation satellite system (GNSS) technology have\
    \ been recently employed for mapping,\ngathering imagery data, land surveying,\
    \ crop spraying, and livestock monitoring [2,3].\nGeocoded sampling is a requisite\
    \ component of precision agriculture and ground truthing\nwhen spatial images\
    \ are used for decision making [11]. Real-time and cost-effective remote\nsensing,\
    \ such as LASSIE (low-altitude stationary surveillance instrumental equipment),\n\
    are crucial in precision agriculture, as it enables continuous and automatic recoding\
    \ of\nreal-time images of crops and soil with GIS reference [11]. This information\
    \ can be used to\nmake informed decisions about crop management resource allocation\
    \ [3].\nSensor data and other data associated with geospatial coordinates from\
    \ a global\nnavigation satellite system (GNSS) provide information to create maps,\
    \ especially yield\nmaps and soil maps for site-speciﬁc management decisions [2,3].\
    \ Yield maps are used\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n4 of 26\nto characterize ﬁeld\
    \ production quantitatively and qualitatively [21], which is crucial\nto make\
    \ management decisions. Analyzing variabilities depicted on maps enables the\n\
    identiﬁcation of factors that inﬂuence productivity, facilitating the implementation\
    \ of site-\nspeciﬁc ﬁeld management strategies [3]. Soil maps offer valuable insights\
    \ into the spatial\ndistribution of the physical and chemical properties within\
    \ a given ﬁeld [21], serving as\nindispensable decision-making tools in precision\
    \ agriculture [13]. This signiﬁcance stems\nfrom the fact that soil’s physical\
    \ and chemical characteristics, such as water availability,\nnutrient-holding\
    \ capacity, bulk density, porosity, nutrient availability, and topography,\ntypically\
    \ exert an inﬂuence on crop yield [21]. Weather and climate trends can also be\n\
    predicted using sensor data, which are important in all farming practices. Harvesting\
    \ time\nis an affecting factor of grain loss in paddy rice farming, which is also\
    \ able to be monitored\nwith data observation [1].\n2.2. Planning, Decision Making,\
    \ and Execution\nAfter creating decisions by analyzing gathered information, actions\
    \ are performed\naccording to the decisions created using data-driven equipment.\
    \ Most ﬁelds are not\nhomogenous in terms of soil and climate properties, as well\
    \ as diseases [22]. Conventional\nagriculture did not take this into account;\
    \ therefore, rigorous use of limited resources and\nexcess use of chemicals and\
    \ synthetic fertilizers resulted in unsustainable conventional\nagricultural practices.\
    \ This also drove lots of wastage, even in the amounts of resource\ninputs and\
    \ yield. Nonetheless, precision agriculture itself has proved that the application\n\
    of technologies to manage the spatial and temporal variabilities in agricultural\
    \ ﬁelds is\npossible to improve performance and environmental quality [9]. Variable\
    \ rate technologies\nin precision agriculture involve applying inputs such as\
    \ fertilizers, water and seeds, and\ncrop protection chemicals (pesticides and\
    \ weedicides) at varying rates, depending on the\nspeciﬁc needs of each area of\
    \ a ﬁeld [23]. In this approach, residual issues of chemicals, as\nwell as wastage\
    \ of input resources, can be reduced. Also, net proﬁt can be improved with\nincreased\
    \ crop yield and reduced input costs, as farmers can use resources according to\
    \ the\nﬁeld requirements rather than full-coverage application in ﬁelds at uniform\
    \ rates [2,24,25].\nAccording to the identiﬁed heterogeneity of a ﬁeld, amounts\
    \ of water, fertilizer, her-\nbicides, pesticides, and liming can be determined\
    \ and applied. When considering the\nirrigation practices in precision agriculture,\
    \ technology-driven, more sustainable smart\nirrigation systems are there to apply\
    \ precise amounts of water at precise times. When\nsoil moisture sensor data give\
    \ an estimation of a required amount of water, irrigation\nsystems can be diverted\
    \ into variable rate irrigation to apply irrigation water until mois-\nture content\
    \ returns to the ideal level [26]. Most of the time, these effective and efﬁcient\n\
    water management systems are automatically controlled, increasing irrigation water\
    \ use\nefﬁciency (IWUE). Monteiro et al. in 2021 described the use of satellite\
    \ LANDSAT data and\nremote-sensing data to develop a feasible operational irrigation\
    \ water model [3]. Likewise,\ntillage depth can be determined via matching with\
    \ variabilities of soil physical proper-\nties [27]. Chemical spraying and seeding\
    \ are also performed according to variable rate\napproaches. Previously, agricultural\
    \ aircraft were used for chemical spraying, where a\npilot controlled the spray\
    \ [23]. In the present, aircraft are employed with an auto-adjusting\nability\
    \ for the application rate of chemicals based on a prescription map, whilst UAVs\
    \ are\nalso used as fertilizer spreaders [3]. Precision seeding can control sowing\
    \ depth, densities,\nand distances effectively while saving seeds, time, and labor\
    \ costs. Studies estimated that\nprecision seeding based on variable rate technologies\
    \ was 10% to 30% more efﬁcient than\nconventional practices [3].\nThis site-speciﬁc\
    \ management increases the number of correct decisions per unit area\nper unit\
    \ time related to net beneﬁts [9] while supporting the conservation of agricultural\n\
    inputs and reducing costs together with environmental impacts [2,13,24]. Another\
    \ man-\nagement tool, grid sampling, also involves the division of ﬁelds into\
    \ a grid and collecting\ndata at each intersection of the grid. This approach\
    \ provides representative information\nof the entire variation within a ﬁeld [11],\

    3.1. Big Data\nPrecision agriculture systems are highly related to data and information\
    \ [5]. Gen-\nerally, unstructured and vast amounts of data are used by big business\
    \ industries, like\nsocial-networking sites, to learn or predict customer behaviors\
    \ accurately [4]. Similarly,\nin precision agriculture, big data analytics are\
    \ applied to understand data-intensive agri-\ncultural processes for decision\
    \ making [6], where analytic tools operate enormous data\nsets [4]. These analytic\
    \ tools consist of data mining, statistics, AI, predictive analytics,\nneural\
    \ language processing, etc. [4]. Big data science usually functions either with\
    \ ML,\ncloud computing, image processing, modeling and simulation, statistical\
    \ analysis, NDVI\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n7 of 26\nvegetation indices, or\
    \ GIS. These conjugations can discover correlations, patterns, and\ntrends from\
    \ large quantities of data via capturing, storing, exchanging, analyzing, and\n\
    marketing features of this high-performance informatics technology [6]. These\
    \ predictions\nand recommendations assist farmers with handling the upcoming outcomes,\
    \ risks, and\nchallenges in the agricultural industry [4]. Combining the data\
    \ in agricultural production\nprocesses creates traceability of product while\
    \ increasing product quality, including safety\nand taste. As customers are now\
    \ aware of the ecological footprint of agri-products, the\nabove combination supports\
    \ the increase in the demand for agricultural commodities [29],\nadding high market\
    \ value. Recent advancements of high-resolution remote sensing and\nintelligent\
    \ information and communication technologies, including social media (Facebook,\n\
    Twitter, Amazon, Instagram, etc.), have contributed to big data analytics in many\
    \ sectors,\nas well as in many stages in farming, including decision making, weather\
    \ forecasting,\nweather management, disaster management, smart management of resources,\
    \ disease and\npest interruption, and harvesting time predictions [4,6,30]. Moreover,\
    \ big data analytics\naid in implementing real-time forecasting in precision agriculture\
    \ [4]. However, data\nupdating, device security, correctness of data, accuracy\
    \ of data, availability of data, and\nsecurity elements, such as encryption, are\
    \ still barriers when combining big data with\nsmart farming [31]. Invalid data\
    \ can lead farmers to make costly, disruptive decisions\nand actions [5].\n3.2.\
    \ Machine Vision Technology\nPrecise and accurate data and information are the\
    \ driving components of precision\nagriculture. Recently, image analysis has become\
    \ a more reliable data source than man-\nual, labor-intensive, costly data-collecting\
    \ methods [22,32]. Here, machines can read and\nunderstand the real world through\
    \ pixel images and produce accurate site-speciﬁc informa-\ntion [31]. Machines\
    \ with ‘eyes’ in agricultural activities are called machine vision (MV). This,\n\
    also known as agro-vision or the ‘eyes’ of robots, provides non-destructive, robust,\
    \ rapid,\nand steady methods to monitor cultivation processes. MV systems give\
    \ machines their\nvision and judgement capabilities in image processing and data\
    \ extraction [10]. Although\nMV technologies have already been applied successfully\
    \ for crop species identiﬁcation,\ncrop stress detection, crop seed quality assessment,\
    \ weed detection, disease detection, etc.,\nthey are still at the prototype stage.\
    \ Currently, emerging deep-learning (DL) techniques in\ngrowing machine-learning\
    \ (ML) technologies are integrated with MV applications in order\nto develop intelligent\
    \ robots for multispectral imagery analysis and real-time analysis in\nﬁeld variable\
    \ rate applications [10,25]. Commercial smartphones, which are ubiquitous\namong\
    \ the human population, are able to be used in monitoring crop health and stress\n\
    based on MV systems [33].\n3.3. Internet of Things (IoT)\nThe IoT refers to a\
    \ network of interconnected items and technologies [16]. The IoT\nis one of the\
    \ most important technological advancements in precision agriculture and\nsmart\
    \ farming [5]. IoT architecture for agriculture, such as agricultural sensors\
    \ with\nICT and UAV, collects data for precision agriculture [31]. Also, the burgeoning\
    \ IoT and\nmobile data are the core of the fourth industrial revolution [10].\
    \ Meanwhile, advancements\nin communication technologies and wireless networks\
    \ (5G, LoRaWAN, NB-IoT, Sigfox,\nZigBee, and Wi-Fi) have broadened the application\
    \ of the IoT in diverse ﬁelds, such as\nreal-time remote control and high-throughput\
    \ phenotyping, while giving better coverage,\nbandwidth, connection density, and\
    \ end-to-end latency (Table 1) [8]. When it consolidates\nin agriculture together\
    \ with cloud computing, it results in smart farming [6] for various\nscopes of\
    \ livestock monitoring, smart greenhouses, ﬁshery management, and weather\ntracking\
    \ [8]. The IoT can be widely used in all areas of precision agriculture with the\n\
    development of sensors with independent intellectual property rights and the development\n\
    of smart devices, such as intelligent tractors, UAVs, and robots that can replace\

    \ data, which are then uploaded to cloud information support systems to man-\n\
    Agriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n9 of 26\nage [4,13,16,28]. Those sensors can directly\
    \ combine with agricultural robots, autonomous\nplatforms, machines, and weather\
    \ stations for real-time monitoring [4]. With the IoT, UAVs\ncan respond promptly,\
    \ leading to high-quality, high-resolution, and exceptionally reliable\nobservations\
    \ through high-throughput 3D monitoring at different geographical areas. At\n\
    the same time, various kinds of agricultural sensor nodes, autonomous farm vehicles,\
    \ and\nmobile crowd sensing have been put forward based on the IoT for ground\
    \ and undersurface\ncognition [8]. Most IoT sensors in precision agriculture are\
    \ in wireless frameworks [13] or\nlow-power wide-area networks [8] and, hence,\
    \ can be used for on-site analysis [3], as well\nas mass data transfer, without\
    \ any interruptions [29,31]. Still, there are cost, operational,\ntechnical, and\
    \ data management difﬁculties in implementing the IoT in agricultural opera-\n\
    tions [13]. Designing low-cost, energy-efﬁcient, wireless IoT technologies in\
    \ autonomous\napplications is affected by the following dependencies: data latency\
    \ on power consump-\ntion, data scalability on storage and processing cost, and\
    \ data interoperability on cloud\ncompatibility to store and process various kinds\
    \ of data [13].\nDifferent IoT devices are coalesced as networks to achieve high-speed\
    \ data exchang-\ning [4,30]. Therefore, the development of an IoT framework can\
    \ also solve problems with\nbig data [31]. With more advancements, agricultural\
    \ operations like protecting, controlling,\nmonitoring, and detecting can be extended\
    \ using smart phones with the IoT [25]. As an\nexample, time-consuming cattle\
    \ status monitoring has also beneﬁted from the IoT, allowing\nfarmers to monitor\
    \ the health and welfare of animals. Also, weed detection through MV\nprimarily\
    \ consists of deep learning (DL) and image processing [16].\nEdge computing enables\
    \ affordable real-time data transmission in IoT precision agri-\nculture, reducing\
    \ data package size and alleviating strain on centralized cloud resources.\nInternet\
    \ and communication companies leverage their expertise to extend cloud service\n\
    capabilities to edge networks, shaping the edge computing landscape. Pioneers\
    \ like Cisco\nand Huawei have developed comprehensive frameworks and lightweight\
    \ computing sys-\ntems. The IoT connects objects through smart technologies, while\
    \ research explores aerial\nedge–IoT systems for improved convergence speed and\
    \ task completion rates [39–42].\n3.4. Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning\
    \ (ML), and Deep Learning (DL)\nAI has a key role in robotics and autonomous systems\
    \ (RASs). The development of\nAI in the IoT has contributed continuous data streams\
    \ [31]. To make agricultural data into\nmeaningful information in decision-making\
    \ data, mining techniques are required. Various\nenvironmental data and farming\
    \ historical records in big data are analyzed using AI, which\nﬁnds patterns that\
    \ are hidden in big data [29]. These discoveries are important in the pest\nidentiﬁcation,\
    \ disease detection, yield prediction, and fertilizing plans [25,31] included\
    \ in\nagricultural decision support systems. AI has noteworthy potential to accommodate\
    \ the\nreduction of food wastage, the improvement of production hygiene, and the\
    \ monitoring\nof machines in many stages of agriculture, such as supply chain,\
    \ agricultural production\npattern, and agricultural production process including\
    \ soil, crop, and water management,\nas well as disease and pest control [4,8].\
    \ Then, AI has the potential to overcome problems\nin conventional farming [31].\n\
    Both ML and DL are subconcepts of AI (Figure 3) [10]. With ML, a computer learns\n\
    independently to improve the performance of AI, which goes through explicit feature\n\
    extraction [6]. ML focuses on the theory, performance, and properties of learning\
    \ systems\nand algorithms, as it is a high-performance informatics technology\
    \ for quantifying and\nunderstanding data-intensive farming processes [6]. On\
    \ the other hand, DL can solve\nproblems with combinations of layers and nonlinear\
    \ functions [10]. To address limitations\nin the practical implementation of robots,\

    \ automation, augmenting\nthe intelligence of other technologies, such as smartphones,\
    \ unmanned aerial vehicles,\nunmanned ground vehicles, satellite systems, automated\
    \ machines, agricultural robots,\nand big data analytics [1,28,31].\nMobile applications\
    \ have signiﬁcantly diverted from these AI, ML, DL, and MV\ntechnologies [10].\
    \ ML algorithms in big data are also critically essential because this\nintegration\
    \ can learn from data to create decisions, data-based prospects, and predictions.\n\
    Due to the intricate input data requirements of machine learning (ML) and deep\
    \ learning\n(DL), the initial stage of adopting ML models in precision agriculture\
    \ may encounter\nsigniﬁcant obstacles in terms of the time and cost involved in\
    \ gathering the necessary data\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n11 of 26\nfrom commercial\
    \ farms [1,6,30]. However, with the continuous advancement of IoT sensors,\nAI-based\
    \ autonomous machines or robots together with cloud computing, edge computing,\n\
    and blockchain can support overcoming this difﬁculty during the transforming,\
    \ storing,\nand processing of data in the creation of ML models [27,36,41]. Accordingly,\
    \ ML is able to be\nused to solve diverse issues in agriculture related to yield\
    \ prediction, crop quality, disease\ndetection, weed detection, species identiﬁcation,\
    \ animal welfare, livestock production,\nwater management, and soil management\
    \ [6,45]. Common principles of ML techniques\nare clustering, decision trees,\
    \ instance-based models, regression, artiﬁcial and deep neural\nnetworks, ensemble\
    \ learning, support vector machines, and Bayesian models [6]. A study\nproved\
    \ that ML was a powerful tool for analyzing data to monitor inputs and outputs\n\
    aiming to optimize plant tissue culture protocols [44].\nSmart farming is technology\
    \ that relies on its implementation with the use of AI and\nthe IoT in cyber-physical\
    \ farm management [28]. According to current applications, AI has\nbeen involved\
    \ in soil management, crop management, disease management, weed control,\netc.\
    \ Examples are the fuzzy-logic-based soil risk characterization decision support\
    \ system\n(SRCDSS), management-oriented modeling (MOM), artiﬁcial neural networks\
    \ (ANNs),\nCALEX, PROLOG, computer vision systems, ANN-GIS, invasive weed optimization\
    \ (IWO),\nand support vector machines [4]. One key application of AI is a mobile\
    \ expert system\nwhere farmers can use their smartphones for disease diagnosis,\
    \ species identiﬁcation, and\nsoil health analysis with the help of mobile apps.\
    \ In addition, AI is a real-time analyzer of\nsatellite images when the progress\
    \ of farming is tracked with satellite imagery [24]. With AI\napplications, precision\
    \ agriculture now has a scientiﬁc background, which helps to make\nprecision agriculture\
    \ more formalized to perform optimal agriculture outputs [29]. In the\nfuture,\
    \ AI may be improved to deal with the dynamic nature of agricultural microclimates,\n\
    as it is now facing difﬁculties ﬁnding a single standard solution for that heterogeneity.\n\
    The existing experience gap between AI researchers and farmers hinders the complete\n\
    understanding of agricultural problems and solutions. To eliminate this obstacle,\
    \ the\nknowledge of farmers, agricultural professionals, and AI researchers should\
    \ be linked.\nIn spite of this, accessibility and privacy protection problems\
    \ when working with huge\namounts of data should be addressed to deliver more\
    \ skillful AI [8,16].\n3.5. Guidance Systems\nGuidance systems use GPS (global\
    \ positioning system) technology to provide farmers\nwith real-time information\
    \ about their equipment locations and herd-grazing locations,\nenabling them to\
    \ optimize ﬁeld operations such as planting, harvesting, and herding [1,12].\n\
    The limited number of satellites, poor signal strengths, and lack of reliable\
    \ connectivity\nwere overcome by introducing a GNSS (global navigation satellite\
    \ system), which then re-\nplaced labor-intensive, time-consuming farm operations\
    \ with more effective methods, such\nas VRA [11,31]. Previously, agricultural\
    \ inputs were performed manually, and during Agri-\nculture 3.0, they were performed\
    \ mechanically using digitalized machines [2]. With rapid\ncommercialization,\
    \ agricultural machinery services have emerged that require efﬁcient\nmanagement\
    \ to prevent overuse or underuse issues. For the understanding of agricultural\n\
    machinery, GNSS plays a crucial role in optimizing effectivity and efﬁciency [46].\
    \ The\nnew trend of GNSS-enabled devices in the fully automated steering of tractions\
    \ is saving\ntime, labor costs, and money [2]. Precision agricultural robots require\
    \ high-resolution\nnavigation solutions [47]. Similarly, agricultural rovers and\
    \ robots are effective only when\nprecisely guided in their actions [45]. Some\
    \ studies introduced DL propagation models in\nGNSS fused with inertial navigation\
    \ data sets for precision agriculture [47]. One example\nis electric seeders with\
    \ optical ﬁber detection technology that were developed and tested\nsuccessfully\
    \ [3]. The new development of software-based farm management solutions\nfor GIS\
    \ encourage the automation of data collection and analysis of supervising, storing,\n\
    decision making, and farm management.\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n12 of 26\n\
    3.6. Blockchain Technology\nBlockchain is deﬁned as a decentralized, distributed\
    \ database that maintains a con-\ntinuously growing list of ordered records or\
    \ blocks, which was ﬁrst used in cryptocur-\nrency [15,48]. Blockchain offers\
    \ data transparency, immutability, and reliability, which\nimprove the mutual\
    \ trust between various parties in the supply chain [15]. As this technol-\nogy\
    \ eliminates the obstacles of corporations, this was introduced to precision agriculture,\n\
    increasing the easiness of the integration of digital technologies into agriculture.\
    \ This step\nprovides solutions to some technical challenges in smart farming,\
    \ furnishing the remote\nmonitoring and controlling of farm equipment through\
    \ the “IoT applied Greenhouse Moni-\ntoring System” [15,48]. One such challenge\
    \ is an insufﬁcient and insecure infrastructure for\ndata sharing. Another challenge\
    \ is the delay of remote-sensing satellites in detecting the\nvariability of croplands.\
    \ Therefore, as a solution for the above decentralization, anonymity,\nand security\
    \ problems in the IoT in smart farming, blockchain has been proposed, expect-\n\
    ing lightweight, distributed, decentralized, and transparent security and privacy\
    \ [5,48].\nBlockchain can assist with having a reliable, faster, and secure platform\
    \ to monitor farm\noperations, although it is still in its early stages of maturity\
    \ [15,48]. As information can be\ncommunicated securely in a distributed network\
    \ [48], with the help of blockchain this can\nimprove the planning of schedules\
    \ for various agricultural processes, such as irrigation\nwater sharing, energy\
    \ consumption, the incorporation of machines and labors, and tasks\nfor robot\
    \ coalitions and autonomous UAVs [15,28]. Especially in the food supply chain,\n\
    this is a crucial point because of food safety issues, as well as asymmetric and\
    \ fragmented\ninformation occurring related to the insufﬁcient supply chain [1,8,10].\n\
    3.7. Robotics and Autonomous Systems\nMost recently, autonomous farming has involved\
    \ a high degree of the use of robotics,\nsensors, drones, and remote sensing to\
    \ perform various agricultural tasks, such as planting,\nspraying, harvesting,\
    \ and weeding, while reducing labor costs and improving efﬁcient\ndecision making\
    \ [3,45]. RASs are a combination of emerging modern technologies that have\nkey\
    \ applications in both agricultural production processes and production patterns.\
    \ Mobile\nrobots equipped with various sensors, actuators, and ML algorithms are\
    \ key enablers to\nautomatically handle variability and uncertainty in farming\
    \ practices [47]. Key applications\nof RAS in agricultural patterns are in plant\
    \ factories, 3D food printing, and biodiverse\nfarming, whereas autonomous farming,\
    \ aerial monitoring, and automated husbandry\nhave become new applications in\
    \ agricultural production processes [8]. However, agricul-\ntural RASs are required\
    \ to be improved to fulﬁll efﬁcient work with accurate guidance,\nautonomous navigation,\
    \ and accurate detection of dynamic agricultural environments\n(changing appearances,\
    \ growth stages, weather conditions, object overlapping, etc.). Intelli-\ngent\
    \ actions, such as robot-assisted plant phenotyping, fruit counting, fruit harvesting,\
    \ fruit\ncounting, leaf peeling, selective spraying, and 3D mapping, are demonstrated\
    \ and currently\nemployed applications of RASs [8]. Auto-steered agricultural\
    \ vehicles are also used in\nmany ﬁeld operations [3], such as tilling, planting,\
    \ chemical applications, and harvesting.\nThese machines, like harvesters, sprayers,\
    \ tractors, planters, and mechanical weed controls,\nuse guidance systems either\
    \ with light bars [13] or a GNSS [2,20]. These guidance systems\nvisualize the\
    \ positions of equipment to prevent skips and overlaps, which is important in\n\
    variable rate applications.\n3.8. Artiﬁcial Satellites, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles\
    \ (UAVs), and Unmanned Ground\nVehicles (UGVs)\nArtiﬁcial satellites, such as\
    \ American Landsat satellites, the European Sentinel-2 Sys-\ntem, the RapidEye\
    \ constellation satellite system, the GeoEye-1 system, and WorldView-3,\nfor remote\
    \ sensing help to generate remotely accessible data in multispectral forms [8].\n\
    The establishment of these intelligent remote-sensing satellites has provided\
    \ full coverage\nfor collecting agricultural information [8,31,49]. More recently,\
    \ ubiquitous and affordable\ntechnologies such as drones, crews, and aircraft\
    \ have allowed images to be captured closer\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n13 of\
    \ 26\nto the ground and at a higher frequency, increasing detail and functionality\
    \ [45]. UGVs ac-\nquire high-resolution data for weed identiﬁcation and control,\
    \ selective pesticide spraying,\nsoil analysis, and crop scouting, while scouting\
    \ robots accomplish speciﬁc targets [49] such\nas mechanical weeding (Oz robot),\
    \ spraying (GUSS autonomous sprayer), fertilizing, map-\nping, and seeding (RowBot\
    \ system), as well as vineyard management (VineRobots) [4,50].\nInformation, including\
    \ imagery data generated by satellites, UAVs, and UGVs, is the\nparamount thing\
    \ in precision agriculture, as it supports vegetation patch identiﬁcation,\nweed\
    \ recognition, pest attack detection, observation of environmental stresses, and\
    \ accurate\nclassiﬁcation in VRT [18,45]. Not only that, in other agricultural\
    \ disciplines, such as aqua-\nculture, agroforestry, and forestry, imagery data\
    \ play a considerable role because they can\ncover large areas when gathering\
    \ information, and these data are reproducible [20]. Data\nfrom satellites, UAVs,\
    \ and UGVs are supported by detailed ground survey data processed\nwith ML and\
    \ DL algorithms in order to make them usable and meaningful information [18].\n\
    For example, in forestry, determining forest densities is labor-intensive and\
    \ time-\nconsuming, although it is an important parameter when combatting climate\
    \ change. Re-\ncently, data of tree type distribution could be achieved over a\
    \ wide area of forest with the\nhelp of hyperspectral images and NDVI and RGB\
    \ images from UAVs such as Sentinel-\n2 [13,16]. Likewise, in remote sensing satellites\
    \ and drones play a big role in monitoring\ndeforestation and obtaining accurate\
    \ coverage of vegetative types and classiﬁcation of\ntree species and are more\
    \ effective than other UAV or LiDAR data [14,34]. Although there\nare limitations,\
    \ drone and remotely piloted aircraft usage is dramatically increasing while\n\
    providing precise information for precision agriculture through hyperspectral\
    \ sensors,\nmultispectral cameras, and other novel technologies [14]. This is\
    \ a cost-effective, promising\nmethod for monitoring large-scale farms or crop\
    \ lands [4], as well as forest areas [14].\n3.9. High-throughput Phenotyping\n\
    High-throughput phenotyping has emerged as a promising approach to enhance\nprecision\
    \ agriculture by allowing the rapid and accurate measurement of plant traits [51]\n\
    quantitatively and qualitatively [22,52]. Accurate and high-throughput plant phenotyping\n\
    is important for accelerating crop breeding [52]. This technique uses advanced\
    \ technologies\nsuch as remote sensing [40,42], spectral imaging [41], and robotics\
    \ [53] to collect large\namounts of data on plant characteristics, such as growth\
    \ rate, yield, disease resistance, and\nmorphology [51,54,55]. By collecting and\
    \ analyzing these data, farmers can gain insights\ninto how their crops are performing\
    \ and make more informed decisions about things like\nfertilization, irrigation,\
    \ harvesting, and pest management [22,54]. High-throughput pheno-\ntyping can\
    \ also help breeders to develop new crop varieties that are better adapted to\
    \ local\ngrowing conditions and can produce higher yields (Figure 4) [51]. A full\
    \ range of visible\nand near-infrared hyperspectral data enables ML techniques\
    \ such as LSR (least squares\nregression) to predict speciﬁc biochemical and physicochemical\
    \ traits beyond simple vege-\ntative indices [56]. ML-based precision agriculture\
    \ systems have AI background [52,54],\nand therefore, when detecting diseases,\
    \ pests, nutrient deﬁciency, and weeds, stressed\nresponses are detected using\
    \ high-quality images generated with UGV or UAV remote\nsensing, hyperspectral\
    \ imaging, and satellite imaging to support high-throughput pheno-\ntyping [57].\
    \ Ultimately, high-throughput phenotyping has the potential to revolutionize\n\
    agriculture by enabling more the precise, real-time, and efﬁcient monitoring of\
    \ farming\npractices that can improve crop productivity, reduce environmental\
    \ impacts, and increase\nfood security [54].\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n14 of\

    \ images generated with \nUGV or UAV remote sensing, hyperspectral imaging, and\
    \ satellite imaging to support \nhigh-throughput phenotyping [57]. Ultimately,\
    \ high-throughput phenotyping has the po-\ntential to revolutionize agriculture\
    \ by enabling more the precise, real-time, and eﬃcient \nmonitoring of farming\
    \ practices that can improve crop productivity, reduce environmen-\ntal impacts,\
    \ and increase food security [54]. \n \nFigure 4. Importance of high-throughput\
    \ phenotyping in agriculture. \nThe traditional methods of plant breeding have\
    \ limitations in terms of time, cost, and \naccuracy. HTP, on the other hand,\
    \ uses nondestructive and rapid methods to gather data \non a large number of\
    \ plants, allowing breeders to identify traits of interest more eﬃciently \n[58].\
    \ A study by Yang et al. (2017) [59] described using high-throughput phenotyping\
    \ \n(HTP) and quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping to investigate the genetic\
    \ architecture \nof maize plant growth. The authors collected data on various\
    \ traits related to plant growth, \nsuch as plant height, leaf area, and biomass,\
    \ using HTP techniques, such as imaging and \nspectroscopy [59]. Unmanned aerial\
    \ systems (UASs) have brought about a revolutionary \nchange in ﬁeld high-throughput\
    \ phenotyping by providing a platform for diﬀerent sen-\nsors to collect remote-sensing\
    \ data in ﬁeld-scale trials. These sensors include regular RGB \ncameras, multispectral-imaging\
    \ cameras, hyperspectral-imaging cameras, thermal-imag-\ning sensors, and light\
    \ detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors that enable the nondestruc-\ntive estimation\
    \ of plant traits, such as yield, biomass, height, and leaf area index. This is\
    \ a \nsigniﬁcant advancement in agriculture, allowing for the high-throughput\
    \ phenotyping of \ncrops. In comparison to ground-based sensors, UASs increase\
    \ the frequency and through-\nput for phenotyping, while being cost-eﬀective and\
    \ providing high-resolution images as \ncompared to satellite-based techniques.\
    \ The phenotypic traits can be used to select crops \nwith high yield and strong\
    \ stress resistance, such as disease and salt resistance, ultimately \nleading\
    \ to improved production [60]. \nAs technology advances, the future of high-throughput\
    \ phenotyping (HTP) appears \npromising. Multiple HTP technologies, such as drones,\
    \ sensors, and artiﬁcial intelligence, \ncan be integrated to facilitate more\
    \ eﬃcient and accurate phenotyping, which can aid \nbreeders in identifying desirable\
    \ traits and making better selections. HTP can also be used \nfor precision agriculture,\

    \ concerns and climate change, the role of\nmobile networks in fostering sustainability\
    \ and innovation is questioned. Sectors like smart\nagriculture, forestry, biodiversity\

    \ Evaluating the capabilities of 5G and 6G networks, including\ncurrent and future\
    \ support, is essential for identifying use cases and the requirements in\nthese\
    \ domains [34]. As an example, a study in Thailand designed telematics-equipped\n\
    tractors to assist farmers in efﬁciently managing their machinery, optimizing\
    \ performance\nand enhancing overall productivity. In addition to improved management\
    \ capabilities,\nthese tractors offered features such as theft prevention, effective\
    \ maintenance monitoring,\nand machine operation tracking [62].\n4. Studies of\
    \ Successful Precision Agriculture Proposals and Implementations\nThe article\
    \ [63] reviewed advancements in automated fruit-harvesting robots for\nsweet peppers\
    \ and apples, highlighting the successful implementation of a sweet-pepper-\n\
    harvesting robot called ‘Harvey’, which effectively addressed detection, grasp\
    \ selection,\nand manipulation challenges. Similarly, the apple-harvesting robot\
    \ utilized a picking\nmanipulator and a catching manipulator, along with machine\
    \ vision and prioritization algo-\nrithms, for efﬁcient harvesting. The article\
    \ emphasized interdisciplinary collaboration for\nfurther advancements in automated\
    \ harvesting systems and the importance of intelligent\nsystems like deep learning\
    \ and crop management software for enhancing productivity and\nsustainability\
    \ in modern agriculture. Field trials were conducted with Harvey for sweet\npeppers\
    \ in Australia, while robotic picking systems for apples were tested in a Washing-\n\
    ton orchard in the U.S. [64,65]. Israel has successfully implemented autonomous\
    \ robotic\ntechnology in their crop ﬁelds, paving the way for the commercial use\
    \ of AI harvesters.\nTevel Aerobotics Technologies developed an autonomous fruit-picking\
    \ system that utilized\nﬂying robots tethered to an autonomous vehicle, enabling\
    \ accurate fruit picking, extended\nwork hours, and additional tasks like tree\
    \ thinning and pruning. This system addressed\nlabor shortages, reduced fruit\
    \ production costs by approximately 30%, provided real-time\nupdates to farmers\
    \ via a mobile app, and aimed to tackle challenges faced by the agriculture\n\
    industry. Tevel plans to introduce its innovative solution to the global market,\
    \ catering to\nfruit farmers worldwide and contributing to the growing agricultural\
    \ robotics sector [66].\nSenapathy et al. introduced the IoTSNA-CR model from\
    \ their study, which leveraged\nIoT technology to classify soil nutrients and\
    \ provide crop recommendations, aiming to\noptimize fertilizer usage and maximize\
    \ productivity for farmers. The implementation of\nAI harvesters in Israel showcases\
    \ the potential of artiﬁcial intelligence, machine learning,\ncloud services,\
    \ sensors, and automation for delivering real-time information and support\nto\
    \ farmers. The proposed IoTSNA-CR model incorporated IoT sensors, cloud storage,\n\
    machine-learning techniques, and an optimized algorithm (MSVM-DAG-FFO) to achieve\n\
    high accuracy in soil analysis. The model allowed farmers to maintain soil information\
    \ in\nthe cloud, reducing costs and improving productivity. Experimental validation\
    \ conﬁrmed\nthe effectiveness of the model for crop prediction and soil health\
    \ maintenance, emphasizing\nthe importance of real-time data collection and expanding\
    \ data sets and regular application\nuse for informed decision making and soil\
    \ quality enhancement [49]. The use of unmanned\naerial systems (UASs) and unmanned\

    \ in olive groves was proposed by [49], with a cooperative robot archi-\ntecture\
    \ using UAS and UGV systems evaluating vision-based navigation algorithms and\n\
    augmented reality tags for return and landing. The results demonstrated the feasibility\
    \ of\nthe architecture for automating inspections and improving pest control policies.\
    \ Challenges\nremain in addressing real-world conditions and optimizing image\
    \ capture. Future work\nincludes real-world scenarios and long-term mission capabilities\
    \ of UAS vehicles [49].\nTwo studies from University Tenaga National, Malaysia,\
    \ present autonomous and\nrobotic machineries to deal with fertilizer and pesticide\

    \ a low-cost agricultural robot for fertilizer and pesticide spraying, crop monitoring,\n\
    and pest detection. The prototype system operated autonomously, reducing labor\
    \ costs,\nalthough productivity slightly lagged behind human workers. An autonomous\
    \ organic\nfertilizer mixer was developed in [68] based on IoT technology to reduce\
    \ labor costs and\nenhance efﬁciency. The improved mixer allowed remote monitoring,\
    \ updates, and alerts,\naiming to further streamline the organic fertilizer-mixing\
    \ process. A harvesting robot\nsystem for cherry tomatoes in greenhouses was developed\
    \ by the Beijing Research Center\nof Intelligent Equipment for Agriculture. This\
    \ new harvesting robot system for cherry\ntomatoes was designed featuring a railed-type\
    \ vehicle, a visual servo unit, a manipulator,\nand picking end-effectors. Field\
    \ tests demonstrated an average picking time of 12 s per\nbunch of tomatoes with\
    \ a success rate of 83% [69]. Also, X. Jin et al. [70] designed a small-\nsized\
    \ vegetable seed electric seeder with power drive and optical ﬁber detection technology,\n\
    providing high efﬁciency and precision by monitoring sowing conditions in real-time\
    \ for\ndifferent seed sizes (Table 2).\nThe Cooperative Heterogeneous Robots for\

    \ cooperative UAS and UGV system for olive\ngrove inspection that veriﬁed the\
    \ feasibility and robustness of the multiple-cooperative\nrobot architecture in\
    \ an olive inspection scenario [49]. Russian researchers Filipe et al. [7]\nproposed\
    \ an approach for dynamic robot coalition that combined fuzzy coalition games\n\
    and smart contracts to form a dynamic and trusted coalition. It enabled the collection\n\
    and dissemination of information from robot sensors in a shared space. Integration\
    \ of the\nIoT with blockchain allows the continuous tracking of food in precision\

    \ plant nutrients, which could contribute to future\ndevelopments in digital agriculture.\
    \ Insufﬁcient power infrastructure is one obstacle in\nadapting novel technologies\
    \ in agricultural ﬁelds. Researchers successfully developed an\nIoT-based solar-energy-powered\
    \ smart farm irrigation system in the United Arab Emirates\nthat harvested renewable\
    \ energy for smart farm irrigation [72]. This study outcome paved\nthe way to\
    \ developing three operation modes that are available for farmers’ use.\nVRT is\
    \ a major constituent in precision agriculture that deploys ﬁeld maps, GPSs, and\n\
    GNSSs to establish the precision of input applications. A study of a data fusion\
    \ method\nfor yield and soil sensor maps [21] evaluated fusion results on ﬁelds,\
    \ highlighting their\nusefulness in decision support for drainage, irrigation,\
    \ and variable yield goals. It un-\ncovered hidden areas of lost yield potential\
    \ using soil sensing, EC, pH, organic matter,\nand topography data fusion. Researchers\
    \ in Beijing, China, developed a new method\nusing image segmentation and pixel-level\
    \ visual features to accurately classify ﬁeld and\nroad areas in GNSS recordings\
    \ of agricultural machinery, surpassing existing methods\nand demonstrating a\
    \ superior performance for high-frequency GNSS trajectories [46]. A\nmultisensor\
    \ data fusion approach was used by Whattoff et al. for creating variable depth\n\
    tillage zones [27]. Variable depth tillage (VDT) reduced costs, labor, and fuel\
    \ consumption.\nA multisensor data fusion approach was developed to map soil properties\
    \ for VDT imple-\nmentation, showing the depth of tillage needed in different\
    \ areas. This approach proved\nuseful in guiding VDT operations for efﬁcient soil\
    \ management.\nOne study in Germany integrated computer-aided farming, an IoT-based\
    \ pH sensor,\nand VRT for effective VR liming, and the lime requirement was successfully\
    \ determined\nin situ by establishing a buffer curve [11]. A ﬁeld evaluation of\
    \ a VR aerial application\nwas conducted in the study of Martin and Yang [23]\
    \ utilizing prescription maps for aerial\nglyphosate applications with variable\
    \ rate nozzles. Accurate spray deposition within 20 feet\nAgriculture 2023, 13,\
    \ 1593\n17 of 26\nof the target was conﬁrmed using multispectral imagery, boosting\
    \ conﬁdence in variable\nrate application and encouraging adoption. Italian authors\
    \ Corbari et al. [73] explored the\nintegration of a satellite-driven soil–water\
    \ balance model and meteorological forecasts to\nenable precision smart irrigation.\
    \ It discussed model performance and emphasized the\nimportance of using consistent\
    \ data for the calibration and validation of soil hydrological\nparameters [73].\
    \ The short communication of Jang et al. [22], “Spatial Dependence Analysis\n\
    as a Tool to Detect the Hidden Heterogeneity in a Kenaf Field”, presented high-throughput\n\
    phenotyping as having potential in precision agriculture. This study demonstrated\
    \ its\napplication for revealing ﬁeld heterogeneity and suggested its use for\
    \ better analysis and\nmanagement in plant breeding and precision agriculture.\
    \ In [57], Kim et al. emphasized\nthe importance of evaluating drought effects\
    \ during the vegetative stages of soybean,\nindicating the potential of using\
    \ phenotypic traits as selection indicators for breeding\ndrought-resistant soybean\
    \ cultivars, especially considering the escalating crop damage\ncaused by drought\
    \ and global warming.\nAnother study asserted precision agricultural applications\
    \ in agroforestry. Tree species\nidentiﬁcation and classiﬁcation is important\
    \ when combatting climate change, as well as\nmonitoring ecosystem health 17.\
    \ Researchers used images from SENTINEL-2 to propose\nmethods to determine tree\
    \ type distribution in a wide forest area using UAV images [14,17].\nThey effectively\
    \ distinguished evergreen, deciduous trees, and grassland areas, aiding in\nforest\
    \ planning and preparing for climate change impacts. Ma et al. [14] used a random\n\
    forest classiﬁer with satellite images to improve texture feature separation among\
    \ tree\nspecies. The overall classiﬁcation achieved 86.49% accuracy and a 0.83\
    \ Kappa coefﬁcient,\nalthough altitude, slope, and aspect inﬂuenced tree distribution.\
    \ These outcomes were\nimportant in species classiﬁcation and biodiversity monitoring,\
    \ as well as in informing\ninventory estimation [14].\nAn evaluation of soybean\
    \ wildﬁre prediction via hyperspectral transmission imag-\ning was performed with\
    \ Python, which detected bacterial wildﬁre in soybean leaves\nwhere different\
    \ varieties exhibited distinct spectral signatures. This allowed the precise\n\
    detection and differentiation of healthy and diseased plants effectively with\
    \ high accu-\nracy (97.19% and 95.69%) in early disease detection, conﬁrming its\
    \ usefulness in soybean\nplant monitoring [32].\nAasim et al. [44] focused on\
    \ establishing the efﬁcient and reproducible in vitro re-\ngeneration of common\
    \ beans through a combined approach of in vitro regeneration and\nmachine-learning\
    \ algorithms. ML models, particularly ANN algorithms, were used for\nprediction\
    \ and optimization. The ML and ANN models demonstrated superior perfor-\nmances,\
    \ proving their efﬁcacy in analyzing and optimizing complex conditions in plant\n\
    tissue culture protocols for breeding purposes.\nA computer vision and deep-learning-enabled\
    \ weed detection model for precision\nagriculture was proposed in [25] integrating\
    \ computer vision, DL, the IoT and a smartphone.\nThe proposed CVDL-WDC technique\
    \ combined multiscale object detection and ELM-based\nweed classiﬁcation. The\
    \ results showed improved outcomes over recent approaches, and\nfuture extensions\
    \ included integration with IoT and smartphones.\nAt the same time, a novel procedure\
    \ involving machine learning and UAV-based\nimagery was developed to accurately\
    \ identify crops and weeds, offering potential integra-\ntion into autonomous\
    \ weed management systems and contributing to improved precision\nagriculture\
    \ practices with reduced resource consumption [45].\nAt Sairam Institute of Technology\
    \ in India, a ﬂood detection system based on the\nIoT, big data, and a convolutional\
    \ deep neural network (CDNN) was developed [30].\nThe CDNN algorithm demonstrated\
    \ superior accuracy, achieving an impressive accu-\nracy of 93.23%, a sensitivity\
    \ of 91.43%, a speciﬁcity of 91.56%, a precision of 92.23%,\na recall of 90.36%,\
    \ and an F-score of 91.28% with a data set of 500. The ﬂood detec-\ntion system\
    \ outperformed existing methods and holds potential for further enhancement\n\
    through the integration of IoT devices and advanced algorithms, ensuring improved\
    \ ﬂood\ndetection capabilities.\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n18 of 26\nIn order\
    \ to alleviate the strain on agri-food production, the introduction of alternative\n\
    nutrient sources can be explored, particularly through the utilization of cultured\
    \ meat and\n3D-printed meat as substitutes for traditional animal meats, thus\
    \ reducing the demand on\nanimal husbandry. In China, the production of lab-grown\
    \ meat using muscle stem cells\nnecessitated edible 3D scaffolds created through\
    \ electrohydrodynamic (EHD) printing,\nshowcasing the signiﬁcant potential of\
    \ prolamin scaffolds for cultivating cultured meat [74].\nSimilarly, the construction\
    \ of 3D-printed meat analogs from plant-based proteins has been\nconducted, improving\
    \ the printing performance of soy protein- and gluten-based pastes\nfacilitated\
    \ by rice protein. This study examined the rheological properties and printing\n\
    performances of edible inks made from soy protein isolate (SPI), wheat gluten\
    \ (WG),\nand rice protein (RP). Increasing the proportion of rice protein improved\
    \ the 3D-printing\nperformance, holding potential for the 3D printing of plant-based\
    \ foods and constructing\nmeat analogs simulating real meat properties [75].\n\
    Several studies have shown why the adaption rate of these studies is slow, and\n\
    one case study conducted in Chumphon Province, Thailand, by Kasetsart University\n\
    examined the adoption of smart farming technology among durian farmers, highlighting\n\
    that factors such as age, occupation, access to extension services, and farm size\
    \ inﬂuenced\ntechnology adoption, with younger farmers having larger farms being\
    \ more inclined to\nadopt technology, resulting in decreased labor and fertilizer\
    \ expenses, which emphasized\nthe importance of providing continuous training\
    \ and promoting extension services for\nsustainable adoption [76].\nTable 2. Studies\

    \ Agriculture\nHigh-tech technologies from the fourth industrial revolution have\
    \ the potential to\nrevolutionize the agriculture industry, enabling more efﬁcient\
    \ and sustainable practices\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n20 of 26\nwhile improving\
    \ productivity and reducing resource wastage. The adaptation of these\nintelligent,\
    \ advanced technologies in precision agriculture is still in its early stages,\
    \ and\nas such, there exist several barriers (Table 3) that must be addressed\
    \ to facilitate the\ntransformation of precision agriculture. However, it is essential\
    \ to carefully consider the\nspeciﬁc requirements, challenges, and implementation\
    \ considerations for each technology\nin the context of the agricultural operation\
    \ at hand.\nA lack of interdisciplinary skills is one of the major roadblocks,\
    \ as big data engineers,\ndata analysts, and data scientists do not have an agricultural\
    \ background. On the other\nhand, farmers with long experience and practical knowledge\
    \ are not educated enough to\nhandle high technology like artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ [8]. The production and development\ncosts of high-tech applications and the\
    \ capital for establishing them in real-world agriculture\nare also high [78].\
    \ This high cost of the production and implementation of advanced\ntechnologies\
    \ may render them inaccessible to small-scale farmers, who may lack the\nﬁnancial\
    \ resources to invest in such technologies [79].\nFurthermore, the unavailability\
    \ of affordable technologies for small-scale farmers may\ncreate a digital divide,\
    \ where only large-scale, educated farmers may be able to beneﬁt from\nsuch technologies\
    \ [20,80]. In the unequal distribution of resources in the world, it is difﬁcult\n\
    for certain groups to reach for such new technological inventions. The implementation\n\
    of precision agriculture trends in many developing agricultural countries has\
    \ become a\ndifﬁcult task due to lack of necessary funds, lack of conﬁdence in\
    \ the technologies, lack of\nproper infrastructure, lack of necessary resources,\
    \ etc. [8,76,78,81]. Additionally, the lack of\nsufﬁcient energy in rural areas\
    \ hinders the use of new technologies, even as science strives\nto develop wireless\
    \ power transfer methods and ambient or on-site energy-generating\nmethods [8].\
    \ Furthermore, low digital literacy and unequal accessibility to digital tech-\n\
    nologies in rural areas, coupled with connectivity issues, pose signiﬁcant challenges\
    \ in\nestablishing sustainable intelligent technologies in agricultural processes\
    \ [20,79,82].\nLimited computer power, storage capacity, and processing speed\
    \ and high energy\nconsumption by batteries are some technical obstacles in precision\
    \ agricultural adapta-\ntions [43], especially when dealing with big data. In\
    \ addition, collecting and analyzing\ndata from agricultural operations may raise\
    \ concerns about data privacy and security [4].\nThese data are heterogenous and,\
    \ when transferring and storing vast amounts, software\nplatforms from private\
    \ companies are needed. This reveals some ownership controversies\nof data [78].\
    \ Blockchain interoperability, privacy problems, data leakage, cyber terrorism,\n\
    and some nonrepudiation issues associated with big data are still difﬁculties\
    \ in precision\nagriculture [5,8,78,83], thereby causing farmers to be reluctant\
    \ to share their data with\nthird-party service providers [4,16]. In many areas\
    \ where agriculture is practiced, reli-\nable internet connectivity, which is\
    \ essential for collecting, transmitting, and analyzing\ndata, may not be readily\
    \ available [7] and, thus, may affect the absorption capacities of\nnovel technologies\
    \ [80].\nThe implementation of trending technologies requires technical expertise\
    \ that may\nbe unavailable in some regions, leading to job displacement and unemployment\
    \ as new\ntechnologies increase the demand for highly skilled laborers while decreasing\
    \ opportunities\nfor nonskilled workers. This has implications for both small-scale\
    \ and family commercial\nfarmers [8,9,20,79]. To effectively use these technologies,\
    \ farmers and service providers\nmay need training. However, different technologies\
    \ may not be compatible with each other\nor with existing agricultural machinery\
    \ and equipment, which could limit the adoption\nof advanced technologies in precision\
    \ agriculture [2,8,84]. Furthermore, the presence of\nbias and discrimination\
    \ intertwined with information technology, education, risk-taking\nattitudes,\
    \ and western power structures constitute formidable obstacles, hindering the\n\
    equitable dissemination and advancement of smart-farming technologies, particularly\n\
    within developing nations [80,85]. This highlights the need for policies on data\
    \ sharing that\ncater to both the public and farming industries and are sufﬁcient\
    \ to ensure data security [20].\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n21 of 26\nTable 3.\

    \ years, the agricultural sector has recognized the potential beneﬁts of adopting\n\
    new digital technologies. However, the slow rate of adaptation can be attributed\
    \ to several\nroadblocks and uncertainties associated with these advancements.\
    \ Despite the challenges,\nthere is a growing demand for organic foods [78], leading\
    \ to a shift from sustainable\nagriculture to smart organic farming. To capitalize\
    \ on this emerging opportunity, certain\nsteps need to be taken.\nOne crucial\
    \ aspect is bridging the gap between expertise personnel and farmers. Pro-\nviding\
    \ better education, along with vocational training on novel technological applications,\n\
    can empower farmers to make effective use of new technologies [20,78]. Governments\
    \ can\nplay a signiﬁcant role by creating physical, economic, legal, and social\
    \ infrastructure that\nsupports the establishment of precision agriculture. Investments\
    \ in energy infrastructure\nand communication infrastructure, internet connectivity,\
    \ service markets, consultancy\nservices, and credit markets can instill trust\
    \ and willingness among farmers to embrace\nthese technologies [2,20,81].\nTo\
    \ further enhance precision agriculture, addressing the lack of professional agri-\n\
    cultural sensors is paramount. The design of high-quality, high-resolution, and\
    \ reliable\nsensors powered by the IoT that are speciﬁcally tailored for the agricultural\
    \ production\nenvironment and the monitoring of plant and animal physiological\
    \ signs is essential [8].\nMoreover, integrating wireless power transfer options\
    \ can eliminate the need for frequent\nbattery replacements. However, special\
    \ attention should be given to enabling underground\nor underwater transmission\
    \ capabilities [8]. At the same time, on-site energy generation\nwith renewable\
    \ solar power or biogas energy can be considered comparatively to long\ndistance\
    \ energy transfer [77]. Although capital investment is high for establishment,\
    \ it is\nmore proﬁtable than grid power.\nCross-technology communication is another\
    \ crucial aspect that needs to be addressed.\nMachine vision for animal monitoring,\
    \ the development of smart phone applications for the\nreal-time tracking of spatial\
    \ and temporal variations, and the utilization of 6G mobile net-\nworks are promising\
    \ avenues for generating valuable data and informed decisions [34,83].\nAdditionally,\
    \ the emergence of new agricultural systems such as smart hydroponics with\nthe\
    \ IoT and advancements in breeding technologies with DL and ML technologies con-\n\
    tribute to the overall progress of precision agriculture.\nFuture advancements\
    \ in precision agricultural technologies hold great promise for\nthe agricultural\
    \ sector. Overcoming the existing roadblocks and uncertainties is essential\n\
    to unlocking the full potential of these technologies. By focusing on education,\
    \ infras-\ntructure development, sensor technology, communication systems, and\

    \ now part of Agriculture 4.0, harnesses the power of digitalization\nfor improved\
    \ farming management. The integration of Industry 4.0 technologies has led to\n\
    notable trends, such as drones, GPS technology, data analytics, and artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence,\nenabling informed decision making in farming practices. Despite\
    \ these advancements,\nachieving a fully integrated agricultural management system\
    \ that comprehensively ad-\ndresses the complexities of the ﬁeld requires further\
    \ studies and innovations. Crucially,\nthe development of adaptive and predictive\
    \ information systems that effectively integrate\ndiverse data sources is essential\
    \ for ensuring sustainable and intelligent precision agri-\nculture. While precision\
    \ agriculture offers numerous beneﬁts, it also poses challenges for\nits widespread\
    \ adoption. The initial investment in technology, concerns related to data\nprivacy,\
    \ and compatibility issues with existing farming systems can be signiﬁcant barriers\n\
    for small-scale farmers. Moreover, the scalability and adaptability of these technologies\
    \ to\ndifferent farming conditions may limit their applicability in certain regions.\
    \ Overcoming\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n23 of 26\nthese challenges necessitates\
    \ the implementation of education and training programs to\nequip farmers with\
    \ the necessary skills to leverage these technologies effectively.\nThis review\
    \ paper serves as a valuable resource for farmers and companies seeking\nto adopt\
    \ Industry 4.0 technologies in agriculture. By providing insights into IoT devices,\n\
    automation systems, data analytics, and precision-farming techniques, this paper\
    \ fos-\nters awareness and understanding of the opportunities and challenges in\
    \ smart farming.\nArmed with this knowledge, companies can make informed decisions\
    \ regarding technology\ninvestments and strategic planning while promoting sustainable\
    \ farming practices and\ncollaboration within the industry. By embracing Industry\
    \ 4.0 technologies, farmers and\ncompanies can enhance their agricultural operations,\
    \ optimize resource utilization, and\ncontribute to the collective progress toward\
    \ smart farming’s promising future.\nAuthor Contributions: E.M.B.M.K., A.T.L.,\

    \ on the use of modern technologies in the\ncyber-physical ﬁeld management cycle.\
    \ Technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and Cloud\nComputing have\
    \ accelerated the digital transformation of the conventional agricultural practices\n\
    promising increased production rate and product quality. The adoption of smart\
    \ farming though is\nhampered because of the lack of models providing guidance\
    \ to practitioners regarding the necessary\ncomponents that constitute IoT-based\
    \ monitoring systems. To guide the process of designing\nand implementing Smart\
    \ farming monitoring systems, in this paper we propose a generic reference\narchitecture\
    \ model, taking also into consideration a very important non-functional requirement,\n\
    the energy consumption restriction. Moreover, we present and discuss the technologies\
    \ that incorporate\nthe seven layers of the architecture model that are the Sensor\
    \ Layer, the Link Layer, the Encapsulation\nLayer, the Middleware Layer, the Conﬁguration\
    \ Layer, the Management Layer and the Application\nLayer. Furthermore, the proposed\
    \ Reference Architecture model is exempliﬁed in a real-world\napplication for\
    \ surveying Saffron agriculture in Kozani, Greece.\nKeywords: Wireless Sensor\
    \ Networks; Internet of Things; precision agriculture; smart farming;\ncommunication\
    \ technologies; Cloud Computing\n1. Introduction\nPresently, the digital transformation\
    \ of the agricultural sector is considered a priority to face the\nnumerous challenges\
    \ presented in the ﬁelds. Environmental monitoring and remote controlling in\n\
    agriculture is rapidly growing towards developing more productive and competitive\
    \ agricultural\nsystems and tools. Precision Agriculture and Smart Farming can\
    \ lead to this direction. These two terms\nrefer to the integration of advanced\
    \ technologies into existing agricultural practices to achieve ﬁne-grid\ncrops\
    \ management. Smart farming systems can provide to farmers meaningful environmental\
    \ data\nfrom the cultivation ﬁelds aiming to boost competitiveness and proﬁt.\
    \ Almost every aspect of the\nagricultural ﬁeld can beneﬁt from these kinds of\
    \ technological advances ranging from planting and\nirrigation processes to plant\
    \ protection and harvesting methods.\nThe future of precision agriculture lies\
    \ upon modern technological advancements and remote\nsensing techniques using\
    \ Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) and different kind of smart sensors. Sensors\n\
    are measuring devices that convert an external stimulus or else input signal,\
    \ into an appropriately\nmeasurable output signal. Sensor devices can transform\
    \ a macroscopic size (light, power, pressure,\netc.) to an electrically measurable\
    \ size. Once the electrical signal is processed, it is converted into a\nstandardized\
    \ signal with certain characteristics. The sensor’s properties can be altered\
    \ in a measurable\nmanner, either directly or indirectly by the exposure to a\
    \ particular analyzer or change in environmental\nconditions. UAVs are ﬂying vehicles\
    \ that do not have a pilot on their spindle. Instead they ﬂy either\nInformation\

    \ Unmanned aircraft used for remote monitoring are part\nof Unmanned Aerial Systems\
    \ (UASs). UASs involve all necessary devices and procedures for UAV\noperation,\
    \ while managing data collection. UAVs enable Earth Observation (EO) towards improving\n\
    accuracy, executing more frequent and better monitoring of the ﬁelds and cover\
    \ large (not easily\naccessible) areas. Sensors and UAVs are a part of the Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT) paradigm. The IoT is a\nmodern communication network involving\
    \ the employment of a vast number of distributed smart\ndevices around a uniﬁed\
    \ wide area network. Its basic characteristic stands upon the ability to recognize\n\
    and notify users instantly about real-time events by the use of smart objects.\
    \ Smart objects-devices\nhave basic computational skills, constrained resources\
    \ and unique identiﬁers for communication.\nThe adoption of smart farming though\
    \ is hampered because of the lack of models providing\nguidance to practitioners\
    \ regarding the necessary components that constitute IoT-based monitoring\nsystems.\
    \ The typically dense and heterogeneous nature of IoT deployments poses immense\
    \ challenges\non interoperability among the desired components. However, an efﬁciently\
    \ designed architecture based\non modern enhanced IoT technologies can pave the\
    \ way into easily adopting and deploying smart\nsystems into our everyday life\
    \ activities. The latest years a signiﬁcant number of efforts were presented\n\
    regarding the most suitable network structure and technologies for smart farming\
    \ applications [1–9].\nHowever, the architectural models presented in [1,7–9]\
    \ were based only on static sensor nodes, ignoring\nthe advantage of UAVs in monitoring\
    \ and failing to provide efﬁcient mapping of the ﬁeld to the\nfarmer. Furthermore,\
    \ no prediction mechanisms were employed in [2] towards improving production.\n\
    Moreover, limited contribution was provided in [3–5] regarding energy saving and\
    \ link layer IoT\ntechnologies in farm management information systems, while the\
    \ data-driven agricultural model\nproposed in [6] did not discuss data security\
    \ issues. In contrast to previous studies, the contribution\nof this paper lies\
    \ upon the presentation of a detailed architectural model for an advanced smart\n\
    farming monitoring system by using UAVs and taking into consideration energy-saving\
    \ and security\nrequirements. This architectural model engages novel IoT technologies\
    \ [10] and Wireless Sensor\nNetworks (WSNs) capabilities to provide a sufﬁcient\
    \ view of precision agriculture. Furthermore,\nthe proposed architecture enables\
    \ a combination of modern remote sensing techniques such as UAV\ntracking, Global\
    \ Positioning System (GPS) for location detection, Geographic Information Systems\n\
    (GIS), real-time monitoring with different types of sensors and intelligent input\
    \ control systems. These\ntechnologies have already been tested in various agricultural\
    \ ﬁelds in different countries for the\ncultivation of rice, wheat, tomatoes,\
    \ vegetables, potatoes, ornamental ﬂowers, chilly, cacao, pepper,\ncorn, olives,\
    \ apples, lemons, grape and others. By incorporating new technologies into agricultural\n\
    production and by using modern EO techniques growers will be able to manage their\
    \ crops at a\ndifferent and more advanced kind of level in detail that was not\
    \ possible a few years ago. This\npaper is an extension of our work in [11]. Towards\
    \ enhancing contribution a use case study is also\npresented regarding an ongoing\
    \ research project known as Drone Innovation in saffron Agriculture\nSurveillance(DIAS).\
    \ The DIAS architectural model is based on the proposed paradigm.\nThis paper\
    \ is organized as follows. Section 2 presents an overview of the proposed smart\
    \ farming\nmonitoring system architecture. In Section 3, the sensor layer is introduced,\
    \ followed by the network\nlayer and its suitable protocols and technologies regarding\
    \ communication, routing, encapsulation\ntechniques and interoperability mechanisms\
    \ in Section 4. Section 5 is focused on the management\nlayer and the provided\
    \ services of the proposed monitoring system, while Section 6 focuses on IoT\n\
    agricultural applications. Section 7 deals with energy-saving technologies and\
    \ security mechanisms\nthat can be implemented in cooperation with networking\
    \ technologies of the system. The use case\nstudy of the DIAS architecture is\
    \ presented in Section 8. Existing challenges are mentioned and\ndiscussed in\
    \ Section 9. Finally, Section 10 concludes this study.\n2. The Architecture of\
    \ a Smart Farming Monitoring System\nA precision agriculture monitoring system\
    \ consists mainly of the sensing agricultural parameters,\nthe identiﬁcation of\
    \ sensing location and data gathering, the routing of data from crop ﬁeld to\n\
    Information 2019, 10, 348\n3 of 25\ncontrol station for decision making, the actuation\
    \ and control decision based on sensed data and the\nvisualization of results\
    \ to the grower through an application. The architectural design of our model\n\
    follows the ISO/IEC 7498-1 standard or else known as the OSI Model [12], proposing\
    \ a communication\nsystem into seven abstraction layers. However, due the employment\
    \ of IoT technologies and artiﬁcial\nintelligence capabilities the basic agricultural\
    \ layers are deﬁned as presented in Figure 1:\nFigure 1. Remote Sensing System\
    \ Architecture.\n•\nThe Sensor Layer, referring to the Physical Layer of the OSI\
    \ Model, includes all kinds of\ncrops sensors and smart objects for data collection\
    \ and monitoring. Sensors can be placed\nunder ground(in the soil), on the crops\
    \ or on UAVs [6]. Underground sensors are especially\nmanufactured to be water\
    \ resistant and usually refer to measurements of moisture, pH and soil\nchemical\
    \ properties such as sulfur. UAV sensors measure environmental parameters such\
    \ as\nhumidity, temperature, wind speed, luminosity or solar radiation. However,\
    \ the most popular\nkind of sensors to be placed on UAVs are thermal cameras.\
    \ Thermal drones which use vision\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n4 of 25\nimaging\
    \ cameras have so many positive uses by detecting heat coming from almost all\
    \ objects\nand materials turning them into images and video.\n•\nThe Link Layer,\
    \ referring to the Data Link Layer of the OSI Model, constitutes of all available\n\
    networking and routing technologies between sensors for information exchange.\
    \ To deploy\nefﬁcient crop and ﬁeld management the IoT platform uses Wireless\
    \ Sensor Networks (WSNs).\nThe use of WSN in smart farming systems provides immediate\
    \ monitoring and optimization of\ncrop quality, while offering a potential for\
    \ large area surveillance with high sampling densities.\nThe constant monitoring\
    \ of a great number of environmental parameters by distributed sensor\nnodes along\
    \ the ﬁeld help the grower supervise and maintain optimal conditions to achieve\n\
    maximum productivity with remarkable energy savings.\n•\nThe Encapsulation Layer,\
    \ referring to the Network Layer of the OSI Model, focuses on the\nestablishment\
    \ of smart sensor connection to the IPv6-based internet. This layer consists of\n\
    IoT networking encapsulation techniques and routing protocols to transform the\
    \ regular WSN\nnetwork trafﬁc into smart information. In other words, the technologies\
    \ of this layer enable the\ncultivated ﬁeld sensory data to be encapsulated in\
    \ IPv6 routing packets and be forwarded to the\naccording network server.\n•\n\
    The Middleware Layer, referring to the Transport Layer of the OSI Model, uses\
    \ different application\nlevel transport protocols in order to forward the data\
    \ generated from IoT sensor devices based on\ndifferent paradigms. It also provides\
    \ interfaces that enable device communication for management\nor actuation purposes.\
    \ This layer facilitates the desired interoperability due to the existence of\n\
    diverse standards, which are endorsed by different entities.\n•\nThe Conﬁguration\
    \ Layer, referring to the Session and Presentation Layers of the OSI Model,\n\
    is situated between the Middleware Layer and the Management Layer. This layer\
    \ is responsible\nfor gathering the raw data coming from the devices or other\
    \ external services, curate, harmonize\nand possibly aggregate them, so that they\
    \ can be published as context information, or supplied\nto upstream data processing\
    \ algorithms or analytics. In addition, this layer is also capable of\nsending\
    \ actuation commands to the Middleware Layer. Finally, the Conﬁguration Layer\
    \ may\nalso be capable of gathering data from other data sources, such as agricultural\
    \ machinery or\npublic geo-services.\n•\nThe Management Layer involves the processing\
    \ and analysis of the collected data. In this layer\nthe most efﬁcient data management\
    \ and data mining techniques are adopted to obtain accurate\npredictions and support\
    \ regarding ﬁeld operations such as optimized pesticide application,\ndisease\
    \ detection, efﬁcient irrigation management. Data processing is supported by Decision\n\
    Support Systems (DSS) that take care of the overall management of available collected\
    \ information\nfrom the ﬁelds towards increasing productivity, optimizing crop\
    \ yield, maintaining quality\nand saving resources.\nIt is well known that farmers\
    \ suffer great economic losses due to\nincorrect weather forecasting or incorrect\
    \ irrigation methods. Data analysis is the most important\ncomponent of IoT agricultural\
    \ systems resulting in efﬁcient pesticide use and protection against\ndiseases.\
    \ This layer can be considered to be an additional layer regarding the OSI Model\
    \ enabling\nartiﬁcial intelligence advancements to the overall system.\n•\nThe\
    \ Application Layer, referring to the Application Layer of the OSI Model, includes\
    \ all\nsuitable application module interfaces for implementing fertilizer and\
    \ irrigation control, disease\nand animal detection, alerts regarding the cultivation\
    \ process and visualization of statistical\ndata. This layer enables the farmer\
    \ to monitor and manage his ﬁelds in a user-friendly way.\nData visualization\
    \ techniques such as graphs, heatmaps, orthomosaics, and three-dimensional\nmodels\
    \ are employed, among others, to allow easy and intuitive representation of the\
    \ knowledge\nacquired from the ﬁeld monitoring. The farmer can inspect the results\
    \ produced by the services\nof the system and take action accordingly.\nInformation\
    \ 2019, 10, 348\n5 of 25\nEnergy-saving mechanisms and data privacy and security\
    \ techniques are also considered to be\nvery important in the context of Smart\
    \ farming and should be applied vertically in all the layers of\nthe architecture.\
    \ To support the efﬁciency and effectiveness of a smart farming monitoring system\n\
    energy consumption should be kept under control. Due to the limited battery life\
    \ and constrained\nresources of sensor nodes, energy-saving techniques must be\
    \ applied across the sensor and network\nlayer accordingly. Energy-saving techniques\
    \ deal with the active and inactive operational time\nin each sensor node, the\
    \ scheduling of information transmission and the routing process of data\npackets.\
    \ Moreover, security mechanisms are vital for maintaining the privacy of the collected\
    \ data and\nsafeguarding farmers’ personal information exchange.\n3. The Sensor\
    \ Layer\nThe Sensor Layer is in charge of acquiring the data of the different\
    \ climatic and soil variables\ninvolved in the growth and production of the crops.\
    \ Data can be acquired either by ground sensors,\nlocated above or inside the\
    \ soil, or by UAV sensors involving embedded cameras, location and other\nsensors.\
    \ The Sensor Layer constitutes the cradle of modern EO approaches towards optimizing\n\
    decision support in remote sensing monitoring systems. EO monitoring of cultivation\
    \ areas is\nhighly enhanced using autonomous UAVs. Popular EO techniques include\
    \ satellite and radar-based\ntechnologies [13] towards estimating basic biophysical\
    \ parameters in the ﬁelds, such as Leaf Area\nIndex (LAI), crop height and water\
    \ requirements [14,15]. According to [16] radar-based technologies\nare used to\
    \ enable the estimation of soil moisture spatial variability and can efﬁciently\
    \ estimate LAI.\nHowever, EO can achieve sturdy higher spatial resolutions only\
    \ with calibration against accurate\nground truth instruments that measure at\
    \ within ﬁeld scale resolutions. UAVs deploy EO via using\nphotogrammetry techniques\
    \ enabling the generation of three-dimensional digital surface models of the\n\
    ﬁelds. In particular, autonomous, manual or GPS-based image acquisition, ortho-image\
    \ generation and\nimage triangulation and geo-referencing based on navigation\
    \ sensors are employed. More information\nregarding these methods is provided\
    \ in Sections 5 and 8.2. In the Sensor Layer each sensor sends the\nacquired data\
    \ in the cloud through a WSN. The WSN is made up of sensor nodes that operate\
    \ under a\nmesh or point-to-point topology, a coordinator node and a gateway.\
    \ Each node in such a network is\nconnected to one or more sensors [17]. In precision\
    \ agriculture the most important types of sensors for\nmeasuring the different\
    \ types of corps attributes are:\n•\nOptical Sensors/UAV Sensors: Optical sensors\
    \ are usually embedded in UAVs and use light\nreﬂection information to measure\
    \ the varying properties of soil and vegetation. In that case,\nthe sensors acquire\
    \ image data, which are further analyzed with photogrammetry techniques.\nObject\
    \ detectors and pattern recognition form the basic building block for extracting\
    \ information\nfrom the images. Such information may involve the vegetation and\
    \ soil color, the moisture\ncontent and temperature of soil and vegetation, the\
    \ position, height, size and shape of vegetation\nalong with the level of chlorophyll.\
    \ In this category we ﬁnd visible light sensors, multispectral\nsensors, hyperspectral\
    \ sensors and thermal sensors.\n•\nElectrochemical Sensors/Ground Sensors: These\
    \ types of sensors acquire data regarding the\nnutrient contents of soil and its\
    \ associated pH. Electrodes in these sensors work by detecting\nspeciﬁc ions in\
    \ the soil. Different families of electrochemical sensors can be recognized depending\n\
    on the electrical magnitude used for transduction of the recognition event: potentiometric,\
    \ which\nindicates change of membrane potential; conductometric, which indicates\
    \ change of conductance;\nimpedimetric, which indicates change of impedance; and\
    \ voltammetric or amperometric, which\nindicates change of current for an electrochemical\
    \ reaction with the applied voltage in the ﬁrst\ncase, or with time at a ﬁxed\
    \ applied potential in the latter.\n•\nLocation Sensors/UAV Sensors: Location\
    \ sensors are usually embedded in UAVs and provide\nspatial information regarding\
    \ the positioning of an element. These types of sensors use signals\nfrom GPS\
    \ satellites to determine latitude, longitude, and altitude to within feet. Three\
    \ satellites\nminimum are required to triangulate a position. Precise positioning\
    \ is the cornerstone of precision\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n6 of 25\nagriculture.\
    \ GPS integrated circuits such as the NJR NJG1157PCD-TE1 are a good example of\n\
    location sensors.\n•\nWeather Stations/Ground Sensors: Weather stations are free-standing\
    \ units situated at different\nlocations throughout the cultivating ﬁelds. These\
    \ stations measure various data for precision\nagriculture such as airﬂow, seasonal\
    \ rainfall, speed of wind, humidity level, direction of wind,\natmospheric pressure\
    \ and solar radiation, etc. Weather stations are an important component\nof EO\
    \ technologies since they can provide daily agro-meteorological information regarding\
    \ the\ncultivating ﬁelds.\nSummarizing the above, Table 1 presents the most frequently\
    \ acquired data by sensors in the\nagricultural domain. A sensor node consists\
    \ of a radio transceiver with an internal antenna or a\nconnection to an external\
    \ antenna, a micro-controller, an electronic circuit for interfacing with the\n\
    sensors and an energy source, usually a battery or a built-in energy harvested\
    \ form. There are numerous\ncommercial models of micro-controllers to be used\
    \ in precision agriculture applications. The most\npopular ones are the Arduino,\
    \ the Raspberry Pi, the Atmega328 and the LPC2148 boards. Accordingly,\ncommonly\
    \ used wireless communication modules used are the XBee module, the WSN802G module\n\
    and the NRF24L01 module. A sensor node can vary in size and cost, depending on\
    \ the complexity\nof its capabilities. Size and cost constraints result in corresponding\
    \ limitations on resources such as\nenergy, memory, computing speed, and bandwidth\
    \ of communications. The types of sensors that are\nmostly used in Smart farming\

    In precision agriculture WSN communication protocols and technologies are used\
    \ to support\nthe connection between sensor nodes in the network and to provide\
    \ a channel for communication\nbetween the coordinator node and the gateway. According\
    \ to the type of application, such as precision\nfarming, ﬁeld irrigation management\
    \ or greenhouse crop management, the sensor network topology\nand communication\
    \ demands may differ. Hardware and software characteristics may also affect\n\
    the choice of communication technology to be used between the nodes. Each node\
    \ uses a routing\nprotocol [18] in the view of transferring the data collected\
    \ to the coordinator node.\nBased on many experimental studies on agricultural\
    \ ﬁelds, there is not an ideal combination of a\nspeciﬁc communication technology\
    \ and a routing protocol. Discovering and keeping up with routes in\nWSNs is a\
    \ quite demanding task since energy restrictions and alterations in node status,\
    \ such as failure\nmay cause sudden changes in the network topology. It is a fact\
    \ that the wireless routing solution for\nagriculture applications should be highly\
    \ energy-efﬁcient, scalable, and autonomous. Up until now\nrouting tactics proposed\
    \ in the literature for WSNs employ speciﬁc methods such as data aggregation,\n\
    clustering, different node role assignment and data-centric methods.\nThe basic\
    \ goal is to build each smart monitoring system upon application appropriate networking\n\
    technologies to operate efﬁciently with minimum energy consumption. Once the coordinator\
    \ node\nobtains the data it forwards the ﬂow of information to the gateway to\
    \ reach the main server, where\nthe database is located. However, in some cases\
    \ the coordinator node can be substituted by a base\nstation to obtain the collected\
    \ data using a Wi-Fi connection as presented in [2], or another cellular\ncommunication\
    \ technology.\n4.1.1. Precision Agriculture Communication Protocols\nThere is\
    \ a wide variety of networking technologies suitable for the deployment of smart\
    \ farming\napplications. The most popular are the following:\n•\nThe IEEE 802.15.4\
    \ standard is a widely used networking technology in precision agriculture and\n\
    deﬁnes the physical layer and the Media Access Control (MAC) technique in Low-Rate\
    \ Wireless\nPersonal Area Networks (LR-WPANs).\n•\nZigBee is another suitable\
    \ technology for short range radio communication in the ﬁelds using\nlow-power\
    \ devices capable of transmitting data over long distances using intermediate\
    \ stations.\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n8 of 25\n•\nLoRa is a type of wireless\
    \ conﬁguration that has been created to achieve long-range connections\nfor Low-power\
    \ Wide Area Networks (LPWANs).\nLoRAWAN is a protocol for managing\ncommunication\
    \ between LPWAN gateways and nodes.\n•\nBluetooth Low Energy is a global personal\
    \ area network protocol built for transmitting small\ndata pieces infrequently\
    \ at low rates with signiﬁcantly low power consumption per bit.\n•\nRFID (Radio\
    \ Frequency Identiﬁcation) is a different technology that uses radio signals to\
    \ monitor\nand identify in real time objects without requiring line-of-sight communication.\
    \ An RFID\nsystem includes a reader, a tag, and a host and is presented as ideal\
    \ for ﬁeld monitoring in\nmultiple studies.\nMoreover, the communication between\
    \ sensor nodes and a base station can be supported by:\n•\nthe Wi-Fi protocol,\
    \ based on the IEEE 802.11 standard. This standard speciﬁes the set of media\n\
    access control (MAC) and physical layer (PHY) protocols for implementing wireless\
    \ local area\nnetwork (WLAN) Wi-Fi computer communication in various frequencies.\n\
    •\nthe GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications), a standard developed by\
    \ the European\nTelecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) to describe the\
    \ protocols for second-generation\n(2G) digital cellular networks used by mobile\
    \ devices such as mobile phones and tablets.\n•\nthe GPRS (General Packet Radio\
    \ Service) technology standard that provides rapid sending and\nreceiving of data\
    \ over the GSM mobile networks based on packet switching, a well-known\nnetwork\
    \ transmission process.\n•\nthe 2G, 3G and 4G (LTE) are respectively the 2nd,\
    \ 3rd and 4th generation of GSM technology\naiming at higher speeds.\nTable 3\

    \ Agriculture Routing Protocols\nData routing algorithms play an important role\
    \ in WSNs by establishing the path of\ncommunication for data exchange between\
    \ sensor nodes and base stations on a network. A variety\nof routing techniques\
    \ have been proposed until now, aiming to achieve higher performance with\nminimal\
    \ power consumption. IoT and WSN routing protocols can be categorized according\
    \ to network\nstructure and the way information will be disseminated through the\
    \ network. A routing protocol can\nbelong to more than one category, aiming to\
    \ satisfy as many performance metrics as possible.\nAccording to the way by which\
    \ routing decisions are made proactive and reactive routing\ntechniques can be\
    \ used. Proactive routing (or table-driven) supports the periodic renewal and\n\
    updating of the routes and destinations that are formed between the nodes throughout\
    \ the network.\nOn the other hand, reactive routing (or on demand) includes discovering\
    \ routes on demand based\non the transmission of route request packets. The downside\
    \ to reactive protocols is their latency,\nsince transmissions over unknown or\
    \ expired routes face delays, for which either the application or\nthe routing\
    \ protocol must account by buffering or dropping data.\nInformation 2019, 10,\
    \ 348\n9 of 25\nFurthermore, according to WSN structure, routing algorithms can\
    \ depend on neighbor nodes to\nbroadcast the collected information. Another popular\
    \ technique is based on dividing the network into\nclusters. Each cluster depends\
    \ on a cluster head node to manage the routing of information between\nother clusters\
    \ or base stations. Hierarchical routing is the most popular routing method in\
    \ smart\nfarming monitoring systems and soil parameter monitoring [23,24]. Multi-path\
    \ routing protocols\ncan also be used to implement a smart farm monitoring system\
    \ to balance the data transfer load and\nconserved energy. Table 4 presents characteristic\
    \ examples of routing protocols adopted in smart\nfarming systems according to\
    \ literature.\nTable 4. Smart farming routing protocols.\nRouting Protocols\n\

    \ monitoring applications are based on machine to\nmachine (M2M) communication\
    \ support regarding real-time data transmission. There is a variety\nof communication\
    \ patterns to be used so that the terminal can receive the information necessary\
    \ to\nmonitor the production. WSN technologies, enhanced by the IoT paradigm,\
    \ enable smart sensor\ncommunication and connection to the IPv6-based internet,\
    \ by addressing the agricultural sensors\nwith IPv6 long addresses that can ﬁt\
    \ in lightweight IoT data link frames. IoT can immensely improve\nthe autonomous\
    \ capabilities of resourced-constrained nodes in a Low-power and Lossy Network\n\
    (LLN). An agricultural WSN is a LLN. In such a network, some of the nodes may\
    \ have a direct\nInternet connection to send and receive messages from the Internet.\
    \ However, other nodes from the\nsame network, may lack that kind of ability due\
    \ to hardware limitations, and require the use of the\nInternet-connected nodes\
    \ to access external services. Data exchange in a local context is also possible\n\
    without the necessity of transmitting data to the Internet. The task of discovering\
    \ the routes and\nallowing data messages to be transmitted among agricultural\
    \ sensor nodes is performed by the routing\nprotocol. Due to this fact, in such\
    \ networks, network performance is strongly related to how the\nrouting protocols\
    \ use the limited hardware resources of the network device.\n•\nThe 6LoWPAN [7,26]\
    \ is the most popular network encapsulation protocol for precision agriculture\n\
    applications. It refers to the transmission of IPv6 protocol packets over Low-Power\
    \ Wireless\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n10 of 25\nPersonal Area Networks. In a\
    \ smart farming monitoring system, it is used by sensor devices that\nare compatible\
    \ with the IEEE802.15.4 standard for WSNs. 6LoWPAN efﬁciently encapsulates\nIPv6\
    \ long headers in IEEE 802.15.4 small data frames for information exchange between\
    \ sensor\nnodes. The advantages of this protocol are that it uses a special header\
    \ compression method and\na fragmentation process to reduce the transmission overhead\
    \ [10].\n•\nThe IPv6 over LoRa [27] implementation enables the transmission of\
    \ IPv6 protocol packets over\nLoRa links. If LoRaWAN is chosen for sensor node\
    \ communication in a smart farming monitoring\nsystem, LoRa is the MAC protocol\
    \ responsible for establishing communication between the\nLoRa gateway and the\
    \ LoRa sensor end devices. In an agriculture monitoring system, the IPv6\nadaptation\
    \ enables the deployment of the IoT paradigm as a separate architectural layer.\
    \ The basic\naim of this layer is to manage header compression and packet fragmentation\
    \ to deal with the\nrequirements of LoRa modulation in the physical layer.\n•\n\
    The IPv6 over 802.11ah [10] or Wi-Fi-ah (HaLow) is a low-power/low-rate protocol\
    \ able to support\nnumerous sensor node devices on a single base station. This\
    \ technology can be used for precision\nagriculture by enabling wireless base\
    \ stations in the ﬁeld to transmit data while also being energy\nconservative.\
    \ Wi-Fi-ah (HaLow) uses special characteristics of the 6LoWPAN technology for\n\
    effective transmission of IPv6 protocol packets over IEEE 802.11ah wireless networks.\n\
    •\nRPL (IPv6 Routing over Low Power and Lossy Networks) [26] is the most popular\
    \ IoT routing\nprotocol based on the distance vector routing technique. It is\
    \ a proactive protocol that constructs\na speciﬁc graph able to direct all trafﬁc\
    \ towards the sink node. RPL is the ideal routing protocol\nfor agricultural LLNs,\
    \ since it can quickly create network routes between sensor nodes in the\nﬁeld,\
    \ share routing knowledge and adapt the topology in an efﬁcient way. It is also\
    \ efﬁcient for\nmulti-hop, many-to-one and one-to-one communication.\n•\nLOADng-IoT\
    \ is another IoT routing protocol, proposed in [28] as an enhancement for reactive\n\
    protocol LOADng, which is considered to be the best current solution for LLNs.\
    \ LOADng-IoT is\nable to boost the process of route discovery, reduce the overhead\
    \ of control messages, and improve\nthe network′s quality-of-service(QoS). In\
    \ a smart farm monitoring system, this protocol will allow\nsensor nodes without\
    \ an Internet connection to forward their data packets to external Internet\n\
    services with much greater reliability and lower latency.\n4.3. The Middleware\
    \ Layer\nThe Middleware Layer is responsible for establishing and controlling\
    \ the association between\nIoT sensor devices. More speciﬁcally, the services\
    \ of this layer include smart device management by\nthe use of different transport\
    \ protocols to forward the generated data from the involved IoT devices.\nMost\
    \ of these transport standards use the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or\
    \ the User Datagram\nProtocol (UDP) for forwarding information. There is a wide\
    \ variety of data protocols [29] that belong\nto this layer towards developing\
    \ an efﬁcient managing platform for smart ﬁeld devices. However,\nchoosing the\
    \ most appropriate device management technology depends on software and hardware\n\
    speciﬁcations, network and technology architecture and communication standards\
    \ being used in the\naccording system to achieve maximum and efﬁcient performance.\
    \ In the view of using different kind of\nsmart entities in an agriculture monitoring\
    \ system, the services of this architectural layer facilitate the\ndesired interoperability\
    \ of the technologies introduced. All collected data will be stored on a remote\n\
    server and transmitted to the client machine through Application Programming Interfaces\
    \ (APIs) that\nprovide web services for third-party users. APIs enable device\
    \ communication in an application level\nfor different kinds of purposes and are\
    \ based on different architectures to transfer data from the server\nto the client.\n\
    •\nThe MQTT-SN (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport For Sensor Networks) is a\
    \ messaging\nprotocol that facilitates device data collection and communication\
    \ with servers using brokers.\nA broker is a network entity which arranges transactions\
    \ between other network entities. By using\nthe MQTT protocol, a precision agriculture\
    \ monitoring system can enable smart sensor devices to\nInformation 2019, 10,\
    \ 348\n11 of 25\npublish messages to a broker and/or subscribe to a broker in\
    \ order to receive certain messages.\nThe exchanged messages will be organized\
    \ by topics that act as a system for dispatching messages\nto subscribers.\n•\n\
    The CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol) is another popular protocol for IoT\
    \ device\ndata management. CoAP is based on a request/response pattern of communication\
    \ allowing\nconstrained devices to have web service functionalities. It is an\
    \ HTTP-like web transfer protocol\nwith the ability to extend the Representational\
    \ State Transfer (REST) architecture to Low-Power\nWireless Personal Area Networks\
    \ (LoWPANs). REST is an architectural style for providing\nstandards between computer\
    \ systems on the web, while distinguishing the concerns of client\nand server.\n\
    •\nThe XMPP-IoT (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol) is an open technology\
    \ for real-time\ncommunication based on XML messages between connected devices\
    \ and the available server.\nXMPP can efﬁciently power instant messaging, collaboration\
    \ and content syndication in a smart\nfarm monitoring system between all network\
    \ entities.\n•\nDevice and asset management in a precision agriculture monitoring\
    \ system can also be\nimplemented using the Mihini [30] software.\nMihini is an\
    \ open-source project by Eclipse\nTechnology that enables communication between\
    \ an M2M server and the applications running\non an embedded gateway. M3DA is\
    \ the protocol used for the transport of M2M data. M3DA can\nallow user applications\
    \ to exchange typed data/commands back and forth with an M2M server,\nin a way\
    \ that optimizes the use of bandwidth.\n•\nThe OMA SpecWorks’s Lightweight M2M\
    \ [31] is another device management protocol for M2M\nor IoT devices. It can be\
    \ used in a smart farming information system to efﬁciently transfer\nservice data\
    \ from the network to resource-constrained devices. In contrast to traditional\
    \ M2M\nstandards in which a device usually needs to keep up multiple stacks of\
    \ technologies, protocols\nand security services, the LwM2M scheme allows the\
    \ existence of one stack of technology for\ndevice management, not only on the\
    \ level of the device itself, but also on the application level.\nIn addition,\
    \ LwM2M is based on protocol and security standards from the Internet Engineering\n\
    Task Force (IETF).\n•\nThe ONEM2M [32] technical speciﬁcation standards are an\
    \ upcoming solution for device and\nasset management in precision agriculture.\
    \ ONEM2M is a middleware IoT platform that provides\nfunctions and APIs for different\
    \ service domains dealing with interoperability challenges. There\nare commercial\
    \ and open-source implementations of this technology.\n•\nA popular queuing protocol\
    \ for enabling server connection in IoT is the AMQP (Advanced\nMessage Queuing\
    \ Protocol). This open standard protocol can facilitate message orientation,\n\
    queuing, routing, reliability and security in precision agriculture applications.\n\
    •\nLast but not least, the DDS (Data-Distribution Service) [33] is the ﬁrst open\
    \ international M2M\nstandard directly addressing publish-subscribe communications\
    \ for real-time and embedded\nsystems. This protocol has the advantage of providing\
    \ fast data, event, and command exchange\namong the IoT sensor nodes in a precision\
    \ agriculture monitoring system.\n4.4. The Conﬁguration Layer\nThe Conﬁguration\
    \ Layer deals with protocols running on top of the IoT monitoring platform\nallowing\
    \ the exchange of data speciﬁed by its context regarding what is described, what\
    \ was measured,\nwhen, where, by what, the time of validity, ownership, and others.\
    \ The main objective of this layer\nis to curate, harmonize and aggregate the\
    \ collected raw data, so that it can be published as context\ninformation, or\
    \ supplied to upstream data processing algorithms or analytics. It is also capable\
    \ of\nsending operational commands to the Middleware Layer. Context information\
    \ is a term widely used\nin IoT research and characterizes data that may come\
    \ from existing systems, users, through mobile\napplications, IoT smart devices,\
    \ agricultural machinery or public geo-services. The Conﬁguration layer\nuses\
    \ an IoT broker to guarantee a common interpretation of information produced by\
    \ heterogeneous\ndata sources that typically employ different data formats and\
    \ ontologies, and therefore are unable to\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n12 of 25\n\
    directly share information among them. An IoT broker enables the forwarding of\
    \ lower-level device\ninformation to higher-level Thing Information.\n•\nRegarding\
    \ precision agriculture applications, a popular context broker is implemented\
    \ by the\nFIWARE NGSI technology, named Orion Context Broker. FIWARE is a framework\
    \ of open-source\nplatform components towards the deployment of the IoT paradigm.\
    \ FIWARE NGSI is the FIWARE\nversion of the OMA NGSI, an API based on HTTP that\
    \ enables the integration of components\nand provides the basis for the interoperability\
    \ and portability of IoT-enabled Smart Agriculture\napplications [34]. NGSI is\
    \ an information model developed by OMA SpecWorks to manage\ncontext information\
    \ with a meta-model based on entities, attributes and metadata. This protocol\n\
    manages data concerning context entities, such as the lifetime and quality of\
    \ information.\n•\nThe implementation of a smart farming monitoring system is\
    \ greatly depended upon geo-services,\nlocation detection tools and mapping technologies.\
    \ In such systems, the exchange of geographical\ninformation should be effortlessly\
    \ accomplished between the involved network entities across\nthe web. The Open\
    \ Geospatial Consortium-Web Feature Service (OGC-WFS) [35] constitutes a\ndesirable\
    \ asset in formulating geographic information and offering direct ﬁne-grained\
    \ access\nat feature property level of the data to IoT sensor nodes in precision\
    \ agriculture applications.\nOGC offers various standards that can ease the way\
    \ location data is exchanged and stored in\na smart farming system that is based\
    \ on drone monitoring. Furthermore, the OpenGIS Web\nMap Service Interface Standard\
    \ (WMS) [35] can be efﬁciently used by UAVs, since it provides a\nsimple HTTP\
    \ interface for requesting geo-registered map images from one or more distributed\n\
    geospatial databases.\n5. The Management Layer\nIn a smart farming monitoring\
    \ system, the basic component of intelligence is considered to be the\nstudy and\
    \ ﬁltering of the collected data. The use of EO techniques enable the advance\
    \ of cultivation\nprocedures and increase productivity by providing the base layer\
    \ for spatial information analysis and\nmonitoring of agricultural activities.\
    \ A large percentage of smart agriculture applications are based\non simulators,\
    \ commercial programs and speciﬁc programming languages for implementing and\n\
    controlling the data system. The Management layer uses modern software tools to\
    \ efﬁciently satisfy\nmultiple tasks, presented in Table 5.\nInformation management\
    \ is deployed so the farmer can consult, record and modify the\ninformation collected\
    \ by the sensors in tables, statistical graphs and interactive maps. In addition,\n\
    it can download daily, monthly and annual reports of historical data. However,\
    \ the farmer can\nmainly see the current data of the monitored variables of one\
    \ or all the WSN nodes and consult the\nhistory. The interaction with the network\
    \ and services layer is achieved using an intermediate layer of\nmanagement logic\
    \ [36]. WSN data will be stored in an online database [37].\nThe system also enables\
    \ Big Data analytics in agriculture monitoring by using tools such as\nthe Apache\
    \ Hadoop software and various Big Data hardware platforms [38] as possible resources.\n\
    Big Data refers to information assets characterized by such a high volume, velocity\
    \ and variety\nable to require speciﬁc technology and analytical methods for its\
    \ transformation into value [39].\nIn precision agriculture smart applications,\
    \ the collected data are recorded in a speciﬁc format,\nto discover patterns,\
    \ correct errors, eliminate duplicate and inconsistencies and to solve noise problems.\n\
    Big Data technologies are playing an essential role in modern farming systems,\
    \ since predictive insights\nare provided regarding optimizing the quality of\
    \ the crop, minimizing environmental impact, reducing\ncosts, increasing proﬁt\
    \ and generally optimizing production efﬁciency. In addition, Big Data enable\
    \ the\nmanagement of real-time operational decisions and the redesign of business\
    \ processes for advancing\nthe food supply chain.\nFurthermore, the proposed architectural\
    \ scheme promotes various data processing techniques that\nupgrade the impact\
    \ of EO technologies in agriculture. EO by satellite leads to the acquisition\
    \ of regular\nor spatially continuous data regarding large areas. It provides\
    \ essential information on the functioning\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n13 of 25\n\
    of ﬁelds and on the causes of environmental change. UAVs enable EO by using photogrammetry\n\
    techniques to extract three-dimensional digital surface models of the ﬁeld, as\
    \ well as orthophotographs.\nOne popular algorithm for this purpose is Structure\
    \ from Motion (SfM) [40]. An orthophotograph\ncan be used to create a realistic\
    \ map of the ﬁelds by measuring true distances and providing to the\nfarmer a\
    \ clearer helpful view from the sky. Based on photographs, digital image processing\
    \ tools,\nsuch as Pix4Dmapper can calculate various vegetation indices that can\
    \ lead to conclusions, either\non each photograph individually or after the production\
    \ of orthophotos regarding the crops’ state.\nVegetation indices are mathematical\
    \ quantitative combinations of the absorption and scattering of\nplant in different\
    \ bands of the electromagnetic spectrum [41]. Calculating vegetation indices will\
    \ help\nto identify useful crop characteristics concerning important biological\
    \ and physical parameters of the\nvegetation. The best-known vegetation index\
    \ is the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI),\nwhich is the evolution\
    \ of the vegetation index ratio and is calculated by the visible and near infrared\n\
    light reﬂected from the vegetation.\nLast but not least, the smart agriculture\
    \ monitoring system also performs data mining processes\nbased on tools such as\
    \ the Apache Mahout Framework so as to identify and discover hidden patterns\n\
    in the collected data, once they are processed, in the form of reviews. In addition,\
    \ Machine Learning\ntechniques will be used in the smart monitoring platform in\
    \ order to estimate the extracted parameters\nof the crops’ growth rate and also\
    \ help to identify objects or animals trough the collected images by\nusing Object-Based\
    \ Image Analysis (OBIA) [42]. Moreover, new machine learning models—algorithms\n\
    focused on data classiﬁcation [43,44]—can be used to minimize the size of redundant\
    \ data and fasten\nthe analysis.\nTable 5. Smart farming monitoring system services.\n\

    \ monitoring system architecture, the farmer can\ninteract with the IoT applications\
    \ of the system to remotely manage the cultivation process.\nSuch applications\
    \ may concern any aspect of the agricultural ﬁeld ranging from planting and irrigation\n\
    processes to plant protection and harvesting methods [45]. The applications that\
    \ can be adopted may\ninvolve the fertilizer application, the weed mapping, the\
    \ spraying process, the irrigation of the ﬁeld\nand the alert system.\nThe Variable\
    \ Rate Fertilizer (VRF) application has as a target to optimize the usage of nutrients\
    \ by\ndeﬁning the amount of fertilizer applied based on the health of the plant.\
    \ Variable rate fertilizer in\nprecision agriculture is an area of technology\
    \ that focuses on the automated application of fertilizer to\na given landscape.\
    \ The way in which the materials are applied is based on data that is collected\
    \ by\nsensors, maps, and GPS. VRF applications bring several beneﬁts related to\
    \ savings on fertilizers and\nchemicals, potential yield increase and environmental\
    \ protection. In the same context is the Variable\nSpraying application. These\
    \ types of applications implement controllers that turn the herbicide\nsprayers\
    \ on and off. Usually variable spraying applications take into consideration information\n\
    coming from the weed mapping tools such as the weed locations. In that case the\
    \ appropriate volume\nof herbicide is estimated and applied in the ﬁeld based\
    \ on the weed intensity.\nThe Weed Mapping application focuses on the visualization\
    \ of the weed occurrences within\na certain crop ﬁeld with the help of mappings.\
    \ The GPS receiver with an aerial vehicle generates\nmaps which show the weed\
    \ occurrences. These weed maps can be combined with fertilizer maps\nand yield\
    \ maps. The IoT-based irrigation system use a micro-controller that serves as\
    \ information\ngateway receiving real-time information from soil moisture and\
    \ temperature sensors placed on the\nﬁelds. Generally, a moisture/temperature\
    \ threshold is speciﬁed based on which the micro-controller\nautomatically switches\
    \ on the water pump. The micro-controller also has servo motors to ensure that\n\
    the area is uniformly irrigated. The entire system can be managed remotely by\
    \ the end-user through\nthe dedicated application.\nAlert/ notiﬁcation applications\
    \ are also very popular in IoT-based precision agriculture. Producers\nand agriculture\
    \ companies implement IoT solutions for instantly tracking their crop ﬁelds. In\
    \ this case,\nthe data coming from IoT devices is processed and transformed into\
    \ knowledge properly visualized\nfor offering information regarding the health\
    \ of the vegetation and the soil, the behavior patterns of\nthe plants, detect\
    \ signs of disease on time, identify insects and harmful animals and instantly\
    \ alert\nproducers about potential difﬁculties. This type of applications serves\
    \ for storing and analyzing data,\nproviding producers with relevant recommendations.\n\
    The aforementioned applications aim at the efﬁcient ﬁeld and crop management to:\n\
    •\nincrease production efﬁciency\n•\nimprove product quality\n•\nprovide more\
    \ efﬁcient use of chemicals in cultivation\n•\nmanage pesticide amounts\n•\nreduce\
    \ energy consumption\n•\nprotect the soil\n•\ncontrol water consumption and underground\
    \ water amounts\nThe IoT-based agriculture applications can be implemented for\
    \ an Android or Windows\nsmart-phone, a tablet or as a web application. The applications\
    \ of IoT-based smart farming apart from\nconventional, large farming operations,\
    \ targets also other growing or common trends in agricultural\nsuch as organic\
    \ farming, family farming (complex or small spaces, particular cattle and/or cultures,\n\
    preservation of particular or high quality varieties etc.), and enhance highly\
    \ transparent farming. Our\nprecision agriculture monitoring system can also beneﬁt\
    \ the dry farming technique that encompass\nspeciﬁc agricultural techniques for\
    \ the non-irrigated cultivation of crops. Furthermore, greenhouses\ncan use our\
    \ architectural model to intelligently monitor as well as control the climate,\
    \ eliminating the\nneed for manual intervention.\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n\
    15 of 25\n7. Energy-Saving Techniques and Security Mechanisms\n7.1. Energy-Saving\
    \ Technologies\nIn precision farming applications sensor nodes are usually powered\
    \ by low-energy batteries that\nare difﬁcult or impossible to recharge or replace.\
    \ This is considered to be a major disadvantage to\nmaintain a real-time monitoring\
    \ system. Energy-saving techniques is vital to maintain the system’s\nefﬁciency\
    \ in smart farming. This kind of techniques can provide battery life extension\
    \ by reducing the\namount of communication between the nodes and the base station,\
    \ while minimizing the redundant\ndata in the network. Energy preservation techniques\
    \ for precision agriculture systems are presented as\na separate architectural\
    \ level covering the sensing and networking procedures of smart farming.\nIn the\
    \ Sensor layer, the proposed energy-saving approach is an on/off process which\
    \ is based on\nthe selection of a subset of nodes that will remain active for\
    \ a certain period of time, while others remain\ninactive. Following this assumption,\
    \ SWORD (sleep/wake on redundant data) is an energy preserving\nscheme that can\
    \ be used to collect data on soil moisture [19]. The SWORD algorithm performs\
    \ data\ncontrol by removing redundant data so as to minimize energy consumption\
    \ and increase the life of\nsensor nodes in the network.\nIn the Network layer,\
    \ data transmissions and receptions can also be scheduled based on the\nsleep/awake\
    \ periods of sensor nodes at predetermined intervals. For this purpose, A2S, an\
    \ automated\nagricultural precision tracking system can be used [46]. Based on\
    \ this energy-saving technology,\nwhenever the sensing period is set by the application\
    \ server, the sink node keeps the schedule and\nit spreads the sleep order message\
    \ over its network every sensing period. Each time a node receives\nthe sleep\
    \ message, it sets the sleep timer’s end time to the value of the duration ﬁeld\
    \ included in the\nmessage. When the meter time ends, the node detects the environment\
    \ and battery voltage level and\nsends the data to the source. Then, he expects\
    \ the next sleep request message.\nMoreover, another energy-saving scheduling\
    \ technique that can be deployed in the Network layer\ninvolves the use of unmanned\
    \ ﬂying vehicles in an agricultural crop monitoring system. Based on this\nscheme,\
    \ the node on the unmanned ﬂying vehicle wakes the ground nodes to retrieve the\
    \ measured\ndata. To perform this function, a coded radio signal is sent via a\
    \ transmitter to the ground nodes.\nThe nodes are in an inactive state, except\
    \ for a small receiver waiting to receive the trigger signal.\nFurthermore, taking\
    \ advantage of APTEEN hierarchical routing protocol, a time division multiple\n\
    access technique can be implemented as a scheduling method. Based on this technique,\
    \ messages are\nsent to put some nodes in sleep mode so as to avoid packet collisions\
    \ between sensor nodes belonging\nto different clusters. In addition, carrier\
    \ sense multiple access technique is another alternative method,\nwhich is equally\
    \ effective for avoiding collisions.\n7.2. Security Mechanisms\nPrecision agriculture\
    \ monitoring systems involve the exchange of sensitive information regarding\n\
    the cultivation process, the state of crops and personal data of authorized staff.\
    \ It is of great importance\nfor such systems to be protected against cyber-attacks.\
    \ An unauthorized entry of a malicious individual\nin the system may cause great\
    \ damage to the cultivation process or even acquire the farmers personal\ninformation\
    \ [47]. In the pursuit of safeguarding a smart farm monitoring system the conﬁdentiality\n\
    of data should be met. In addition, it is vital to ensure the reliability of the\
    \ data and the ability to\nconﬁrm that a message has not been tampered with, altered\
    \ or changed while on the network. Also,\nthe services of resources offered by\
    \ the network, or by a single sensor node must be available whenever\nrequired\
    \ and ﬁnally to be able to identify the origin of a message received. Basic security\
    \ mechanisms\nare already deployed by the combined IoT technologies in every architectural\
    \ level of the proposed\nsmart monitoring system. However, there are more ways\
    \ to increase the level of security in each\nlayer separately.\nOne popular way\
    \ of providing physical layer security in WSN and IoT systems is cryptography.\n\
    Physical layer security refers to the inner security capabilities of the Sensor\
    \ layer regarding the\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n16 of 25\nrandomness of wireless\
    \ channels, the signal-to-noise ratio gaps or intended jamming. There are\nthree\
    \ kinds of cryptographic methods used in WSNs, the symmetric and asymmetric ones\
    \ and hash\nfunctions. Hash functions are special mathematical functions which\
    \ map a given input to a certain\noutput with a ﬁxed size. Well-known cryptographically\
    \ secure hashes are the Secure Hash Algorithm-2\n(SHA-2) and Advanced Encryption\
    \ Standard (AES) algorithm. In symmetric cryptographic techniques,\na single shared\
    \ key is used between the two communicating nodes both for encryption and decryption.\n\
    This key stays known only to the nodes of the network. On the other hand, in asymmetric\
    \ cryptography,\na private key can be used to decrypt and sign data. A public\
    \ key is also used to encrypt and verify data.\nThe private key needs to be kept\
    \ conﬁdential while the public key can be published freely. Asymmetric\ncryptographic\
    \ techniques may use the RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) algorithm, the ECC (Elliptical\n\
    Curve Cryptography) algorithm or the pairing technique. Popular frameworks of\
    \ symmetric and\nasymmetric technique can be found in [48].\nRegarding the Link\
    \ layer of our proposed architecture security mechanisms focus against the\ninterception,\
    \ modiﬁcation and fabrication of the exchanged data. Attack detection mechanisms\
    \ can\nbe applied, such as the misbehavior-aware threshold detection scheme for\
    \ LLNs proposed in [49].\nIn addition, secure routing protocols may be used such\
    \ as SAR(Secure aware routing protocol), which is\nbased on on-demand protocol\
    \ such as AODV or DSR and DPRAODV (Detection, Prevention and\nReactiveAODV) [50].\n\
    Middleware security mechanisms deal with unauthorized modiﬁcations that occur\
    \ due to\ntransmission errors (accidental) and require the use of digital signatures.\
    \ Digital signature schemes\nare cryptographic schemes that include key generation\
    \ algorithms, signing algorithms and signature\nverifying algorithms. A digital\
    \ signature is an authentication mechanism that enables the creator of the\nmessage\
    \ to attach a code that acts as a signature. The Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA),\
    \ developed by\nthe National Institute of Standards and Technology, is one of\
    \ many examples of a signing algorithm.\nAccess control is an important building\
    \ block for the overall security of a precision agriculture\nmonitoring system.\
    \ The IoT requires access control models that apply authorization policies across\n\
    a multitude of smart sensors. In a smart farm monitoring platform, authentication\
    \ is required\nto prevent authorized users from accessing resources in an unauthorized\
    \ manner. For instance,\na worker in the ﬁelds is a legitimate user but does not\
    \ have the access rights as the main administrator\nfarmer. Most importantly,\
    \ access control prevents illegitimate users from gaining access to resources.\n\
    The Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) model is a technique that assigns attributes\
    \ to each entity\nin the system. The attributes may refer to either a user or\
    \ a resource and are deﬁned as properties\nof every entity to enable authentication.\
    \ Another paradigm able to provide solid communication in\nthe application layer\
    \ is the Role-Based Access Control model (RBAC) where a user is assigned as\n\
    administrator or ordinary user that predetermines access rights policies. In the\
    \ Application layer,\neach user can be authenticated by the use of passwords or\
    \ a smart key card [51].\n8. Use Case Study: The DIAS Architecture\nThe DIAS research\
    \ project stands for Drone Innovation in saffron Agriculture Surveillance.\nIt\
    \ is co-funded by the European Union and Greek national funds through the Operational\
    \ Program\nCompetitiveness, Entrepreneurship, and Innovation. University of Western\
    \ Macedonia (UOWM) in\ncooperation with Kozani Saffron Producers Cooperative (KSPC)\
    \ aims at developing an integrated\nautomated surveillance system for saffron\
    \ cultivation.\nThis 24 h real-time saffron cultivation\nsurveillance system is\
    \ relied on signal and image collecting and processing, which is derived from\n\
    advanced surveillance, risk identiﬁcation and early warning systems, based on\
    \ integrated sensor\nnetworks, and aerial unmanned vehicles.\n8.1. Saffron Cultivation\n\
    The saffron cultivation is considered to be of extreme importance for the Western\
    \ Macedonia\ncitizens, due to the activity over saffron cultivation by a large\
    \ number of citizens, the limited farming\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n17 of 25\n\
    geography, the unique production process to plant the saffron seeds, and the unique\
    \ production risk\nthat this operation faces. The only kind of saffron that is\
    \ systematically cultivated around the world,\nfor at least ten centuries, is\
    \ the edible saffron or as it known in scientiﬁc (botanical) terminology Crocus\n\
    Sativus Linneaus.\nThe cultivation process includes harvesting the ﬂowers, as\
    \ presented in Figure 2, splitting the\nstigmas and stamens from the petals, drying\
    \ and sorting of saffron. The picking of 1000 ﬂowers is\nprocess of a duration\
    \ around 45–55 min, while additional 100 to 130 min are required for removing\n\
    the stigmas for drying. In total, 370 to 470 h are required to produce 1 kg of\
    \ dried saffron [52].\nThe ﬂowers are picked exactly when they are fully bloomed,\
    \ and the saffron strand or stigma is at its\nreddest. The harvesting process\
    \ begins shortly after dawn to minimize the further sunlight exposure\nto the\
    \ crops, since they may lose their color and even ﬂavor. Saffron cultivation requires\
    \ dry soil\nwith speciﬁc levels of moisture, controlled irrigation and right amounts\
    \ of nitrogen, phosphorus\nand potassium. Cultivation is commonly disturbed by\
    \ mice, moles and rats wrecking the stems.\nFurthermore, fungi may cause speciﬁc\
    \ diseases at the early stages of saffron growth.\nFigure 2. Saffron harvesting.\n\
    The DIAS platform aims to improve the production process, by offering the ability\
    \ of immediate\ninterference in case of animal, disease or wild weeds detection.\
    \ The farmer will be able to monitor the\nﬁelds in real time and getting alerts\
    \ in case of unwanted incidents regarding the state of the plants\nduring all\
    \ cultivation period, while raising proﬁts. To satisfy these goals, the monitoring\
    \ process will\nbe aligned speciﬁcally with the farmers concerns and actions during\
    \ each month of cultivation as\npresented in Figure 3.\nFigure 3. Saffron cultivation\
    \ yearly stages.\n8.2. DIAS Architecture\nThe DIAS platform follows the architectural\
    \ design of the proposed remote sensing monitoring\nsystem. As presented in Figure\
    \ 4 the DIAS system is consisted of seven architectural layers. In each\nlayer\
    \ the most suitable aforementioned technologies are used towards achieving the\
    \ overall system’s\nefﬁcient performance and reliable operations. The saffron\
    \ cultivation is a quite demanding and delicate\nprocess requiring the deployment\
    \ of tailor-based technologies and continuous crop monitoring to\navoid animal\
    \ and disease interventions.\nIn the Sensor layer, quadcopter UAVs with thermal,\
    \ hyperspectral and RGB cameras are being\nused in cooperation with multiple wireless\
    \ nodes equipped with various sensors for data collection\nregarding the crops.\
    \ Saffron cultivation monitoring requires the study of small sized crops and\n\
    the notice of minimal crop state variations during each month. To select the desired\
    \ information\nUAVs must ﬂy in a certain distance and place for a speciﬁc period\
    \ of time and by using different\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n18 of 25\nposition\
    \ angles. Quadcopter UAVs is considered to be the best choice for saffron monitoring\
    \ since\nthey have rotary wings, which provide them with the ability of maneuverability,\
    \ while also ﬂying\nin low speed. Regarding RGB cameras, they are ideal since\
    \ saffron cultivation requires the capture\nof data-images in different weather\
    \ conditions avoiding inadequate or excessive exposure of the\nimage. Using multispectral\
    \ or hyperspectral sensors, UAVs can also obtain information related to\nspectral\
    \ absorption and reﬂection of the crops in several bands. This quite useful since\
    \ the provided\ninformation can then be used to calculate vegetation indices and\
    \ monitor the state of saffron crops\nbased on them. On the other hand, thermal\
    \ imaging detects speciﬁc levels of radiation and translates\nit into a grayscale\
    \ image, using brighter and darker shades of heat representation. This ability\
    \ is also\nessential in saffron cultivation since the ﬁelds are regularly trampled\
    \ by animals that are not being\ndetected on time in before they cause any damage.\
    \ The DIAS monitoring system uses different ground\nand on-leaf sensors to collect\
    \ useful data for improving the cultivation process. More speciﬁcally,\nenvironmental\
    \ humidity and temperature is evaluated since saffron requires speciﬁc conditions\
    \ to\nprosper. Additionally, the levels of luminosity, leaf-wetness, soil moisture,\
    \ pH and wind speed are also\nof great importance. Furthermore, the amounts of\
    \ nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium in the soil can\nhave a severe impact on\
    \ the plant’s growth, as well as the moisture levels in the soil. The farmer will\n\
    be able to predict production loss efﬁciently due to a round knowledge of the\
    \ saffron ﬁelds condition\nand even intervene with possible treatments to change\
    \ its course for the better.\nRegarding the Link and Encapsulation layer, sensor\
    \ data exchange in the DIAS platform is enabled\nby the LoRaWAN technology and\
    \ the IPv6 protocol. LoRa technology offers several advantages.\nThe LoRa physical\
    \ layer uses ISM bands 868 and 915 MHz—frequencies that are free to use anywhere\n\
    in the world. In addition, LoRa devices consume very little power making it ideal\
    \ for battery-powered\ndevices and it can also transmit and receive data for up\
    \ to 15 km in suburban areas and 5 km in\nurban areas. Another advantage of LoRa\
    \ is its high network capacity. In LoRaWAN, a single gateway\ncan accommodate\
    \ 1000 end-node devices. On the other hand, IPv6 offers large addressing space\n\
    and has built-in support for network auto-conﬁguration. In the DIAS platform,\
    \ each sensor node\nis characterized by its own IP address and uses a power saving\
    \ scheduling and routing protocol to\ntransmit the collected data to the nearest\
    \ LoRa Gateway. The information to be exchanged is encrypted\nbefore transmission.\
    \ Each LoRa gateway forwards the information to the according network router for\n\
    Internet access and data storage to the system’ database. UAVs’ data transmission\
    \ and communication\nis enabled by the IEEE 802.11ah networking standard in cooperation\
    \ with the IPv6 protocol, to forward\nthe collected images to the network server\
    \ as well.\nIn the Middleware layer, the DIAS platform will employ the MQTT-SN\
    \ protocol. MQTT-SN\nenables the management of all DIAS networking devices through\
    \ message exchanges coordinated by\nthe FIWARE’s context broker. It is essential\
    \ to maintain the monitoring’s system reliability towards\nachieving meaningful\
    \ data collection. Based on this protocol, the exchanged messages can be organized\n\
    by topics and importance regarding device management commands, transmission requests\
    \ initiated by\na higher layer and data acquisition. Sixteen number of message\
    \ types are supported and transmitted\nin an asynchronous way of communication\
    \ by the publish-subscribe model. TCP and UDP will also be\nused as transport\
    \ protocols. MQTT is ideal for the DIAS system since it excels in smart sensor\
    \ device\ncommunication on a wide area network, due to the publish/subscribe architecture\
    \ with the broker\nin the middle. MQTT is also very useful if the bandwidth is\
    \ limited to enhance network reliability\nand availability.\nIn the according\
    \ Conﬁguration layer, all saffron ﬁeld collected data will be grouped and\nformulated\
    \ to reach the information management unit. This layer facilitates the FIWARE\
    \ NGSI\nAPI so to produce the desired information model of the acquired ﬁeld data\
    \ based on efﬁcient\ncontext management.\nThe FIWARE’s Orion Context Broker has\
    \ powerful features enhancing\nthe capabilities and performance of the DIAS monitoring\
    \ system such as enabling asynchronous\napplication notiﬁcations. The basic operations\
    \ of the current layer include enabling the publication,\nInformation 2019, 10,\
    \ 348\n19 of 25\nconsumption, subscription and processing of all the information\
    \ relevant to the crops and the\ncultivation process in the DIAS platform.\nFigure\
    \ 4. The DIAS architecture.\nThe Management layer constitutes the basic operation\
    \ center of the DIAs platform. It stores,\nmaintains, analyzes the collected data\
    \ and produces predictions for the progress of the crops growth\nrate and statistics\
    \ regarding they current state. According to the commands acquired from the user\
    \ of\nthe platform in the highest architectural layer, the information management\
    \ logic initiates the according\nprocesses. Data processing includes the use of\
    \ the Random Forest machine learning classiﬁcation\nalgorithm for direct extraction\
    \ of conclusions regarding the growth and health of vegetation. This\nalgorithm\
    \ is directly applied on the data of the images acquired by the UAVs, evaluating\
    \ the RGB\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n20 of 25\ncolors and the intensity of each\
    \ pixel. The Random Forest scheme performs very well with high\ndimensionality\
    \ and can handle binary features, categorical features, and numerical features.\
    \ This\nmethod is chosen since very little pre-processing is required and the\
    \ data does not need to be rescaled\nor transformed. Digital image processing\
    \ of geospatially corrected aerial images (orthophotographs)\nfocuses on producing\
    \ the according vegetation indexes for evaluating the state of saffron plants.\
    \ Two\nkind of vegetation indexes will be calculated by the PiX4D image processing\
    \ tool. Vegetation indexes\nderived from multispectral information, such as NDVI\
    \ will enable the detection of unhealthy or sparse\nvegetation that reﬂects more\
    \ visible light and less near infrared light, making it easy to monitor the\n\
    growth and health of saffron crops. On the other hand, regarding the use of RGB-based\
    \ Vegetation\nIndices, Excess Greenness Index (ExG) is based on the assumption\
    \ that saffron plants will display a\nclear high degree of greenness, while soil\
    \ being the only background element. Finally, the Normalized\nDifference Index\
    \ (NDI) will be also used since it can enable the separation of saffron plants\
    \ from\nsoil and residue background images, using only green and red channels.\
    \ Spectral information can\nhelp signiﬁcantly in assessing a lot biological and\
    \ physical characteristics of the saffron crops. Any\nkind of wild weeds or animal\
    \ detection based on thermal imaging in the ﬁelds initiates alerts for\nimmediate\
    \ intervention and is taken into consideration as a note in the cultivation calendar\
    \ created by\nthe platform for the farmer. For this purpose, the OBIA algorithm\
    \ is also used to recognize weeds or\ndiscriminate species. Object-based image\
    \ analysis is based on the comparison between sets of similar\npixels called image\
    \ objects in measures of spectral properties (i.e., color), size, shape, and texture,\n\
    as well as context. The OBIA algorithm is chosen since it is more suited to landscape-scale\
    \ analyses\nand can ﬁlter out meaningless information and assimilate other pieces\
    \ of information into a single\nobject. After processing, all the collected sensor\
    \ data are categorized and evaluated in accordance with\nthe desired vegetation\
    \ index values, moisture levels and general plant state for each month during\n\
    the cultivation process. For these tasks, the DIAS platform employs powerful and\
    \ well-known tools,\nthe Apache Spark Framework focusing on Big Data analytics\
    \ and the WEKA (Waikato Environment)\nFramework specializing in data mining tasks.\
    \ The evaluation results will point out the vulnerable\nspots in the ﬁeld with\
    \ helpful statistical graphs and suggest possible solutions to the farmer, such\
    \ as\nthe use of fertilizer.\nIn the Application Layer, each user can access the\
    \ DIAS platform by using his/her own unique\npassword. According to their authority\
    \ and activities in the saffron ﬁeld the users have different access\nrights in\
    \ the DIAS platform. A user may be the administrator of the platform, a representative\
    \ of the\nKSPC board, a farmer or a worker in the ﬁelds. For instance, a worker\
    \ can only observe the evaluation\nresults in order to aid the farmer in treating\
    \ the plant growth, while the KSPC representative can\nadd observation notes,\
    \ can schedule and initiate sensor data collection in a speciﬁc ﬁeld and also\n\
    manage the ﬂight plan of UAVs. On the other hand, the platform administrator is\
    \ only one who can\nadd new users and new saffron ﬁelds for cultivation to be\
    \ observed in the system. Access in the\nDIAS platform is forbidden for non-authorized\
    \ users. In the Application layer, the management of\nthe four basic operational\
    \ units of the DIAS system can be initiated. These are the Visualization Unit,\n\
    the Data Management Unit, the Prediction Unit and the Data collection Unit. By\
    \ entering the Data\ncollection Unit, a user can initiate sensor data collection\
    \ in a selected ﬁeld or modify existing data\nin the platform. By entering the\
    \ Data Management Unit, the user can evaluate orthophotographs\nand calculate\
    \ vegetation indexes according to speciﬁc data in a speciﬁc saffron ﬁeld with\
    \ the help of\nPix4DMapper tool. The Visualization Unit is related to the presentation\
    \ of statistical results and graphs\nregarding each saffron ﬁeld, while the Prediction\
    \ Unit employs the aforementioned data mining tools\nto produce a sufﬁcient evaluation\
    \ of the collected data. All system information is stored in the central\nserver\
    \ database.\nBased on the acquired and processed data, farmers can produce statistics\
    \ regarding the progress in\nsaffron production and avoid ﬁnancial loss, while\
    \ improving the quality of the crops and accomplishing\na considerable rise in\
    \ production.\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n21 of 25\n8.3. Beneﬁts and Costs\nGreece\
    \ is the second largest saffron producing country, with an average output of 4\
    \ tons of p.a.\nduring the last four decades, most of which is directed in export\
    \ markets. The establishment of the\n‘Kozani Saffron Producers Cooperative’ marked\
    \ the beginning of a good decade for this product\nwith production reaching its\
    \ height record of more than 12 tons in 1982 [53]. Nevertheless, in the\nperiod\
    \ following Greece’s accession to the European Community, farmers began abandoning\
    \ saffron\ncultivation. This fact resulted in a signiﬁcant decrease in yield with\
    \ an average yield of 800 g per\nstremma (1 ha = 10 stremmas = 1000 m2 ). However,\
    \ this trend seems to be reversed since 2010 and\ncurrently yields vary around\
    \ 1 ton per stremma. Currently, Greek saffron price is about 1200 euros per\n\
    Kg. Nearly 5000 spots are needed to produce 100 g of red saffron. The average\
    \ produce per acre is 6 kg\nof dried stigmas (red product). The lower production\
    \ of the plant is on the ﬁrst year of the plantation,\nwhile the highest on the\
    \ third and the fourth.\nIn the year of 2015, a study in Greek saffron cultivation\
    \ resulted that farm managers need\nto address the efﬁciency of input use and\
    \ raise capital and labor productivities to maintain\ncompetitiveness [53]. The\
    \ saffron quality is determined by the color, ﬂavor and size of the stigmas.\n\
    The DIAS platform aims to upgrade proﬁt earnings by the adoption of new technologies,\
    \ ensuring\nﬂower picking at appropriate time in a proper collection material\
    \ at an appropriate age. Animal\nintrusions in the ﬁelds, causing a huge loss\
    \ in production, will be prevented and crops diseases will\nbe detected in time.\
    \ The overall equipment cost is considered to be a safe investment for farmers\n\
    since most of the technologies involved are open source and the initial cost of\
    \ the related hardware\nand software can be shared across producers. Currently,\
    \ the DIAS initiative is under construction\nand no experimental results are available\
    \ to conﬁrm the proposed objectives. However, in Table 6\nwe present the production\
    \ rate of Greek Saffron as recorded in [53], while in Table 7 an average\nestimation\
    \ is provided regarding the increase in cultivation operations by adopting the\
    \ DIAS platform.\nThese percentages are the estimations provided by two of the\
    \ producers whose ﬁelds participate in\nthe pilot study. The estimations show\
    \ that on average the farmers calculate an increase of around\n20% in production,\
    \ this percentage is in accordance to other types of cultivations such as olives\
    \ and\npotatoes [54].\nThe use of the DIAS project can offer a signiﬁcant increase\
    \ in saffron production. Nevertheless,\nsince no pilots have been implemented\
    \ yet in the project, the Return on Investment (ROI) is difﬁcult to be\nestimated.\
    \ An investment of time and money from the DIAS consortium is required to investigate\
    \ how\nthe data gathered from UAVs can connect to and affect other things that\
    \ are happening on the ﬁelds.\nSaffron growers need that information to provide\
    \ context and create a correlation regarding causes\nand effects. At that point\
    \ ROI becomes signiﬁcant promoting UAVs as a part of the desired solution\nand\
    \ not as the solution itself. Furthermore, due to shared costs between project\
    \ partners, ROI becomes\na collective performance measure that can be estimated\
    \ only when each member has acquired the\naccording technological beneﬁts. A complex\
    \ proﬁtability study is required to specify the precision\nservice offerings,\
    \ as presented in [55,56]. Each partner in the DIAS project owns and offers different\n\
    assets in this endeavor, thus calculating the overall ROI of UAV usage from the\
    \ side of farmers is not\nyet possible.\nTable 6. Greek saffron cultivation economic\

    \ system in precision agriculture faces\nseveral challenges. The greatest challenge\
    \ in the sensor layer is for sensor nodes to achieve efﬁcient and\ncontinuous\
    \ operation for a long time in a natural environment, while taking into account\
    \ the climate\nchange and wildlife interventions. The battery life of sensor nodes\
    \ is not considered satisfactory,\nand it is necessary to design and implement\
    \ energy-saving protocols with the highest possible\nsystem performance among\
    \ other precautions. In addition, depending on the type of application,\nthe supported\
    \ agricultural work and the implementation technologies, the problems that arise\
    \ can be\ndifferentiated. For instance, the use of sensors and controllers from\
    \ different manufacturers prevents\ncommunication between them and makes it more\
    \ difﬁcult to interconnect with other agricultural\ncomponents. Also, the sensor\
    \ inertia phenomenon was observed in a high-speed WSN due to non-steep\nchanges\
    \ in humidity and soil temperature.\nIn the network layer, the basic challenges\
    \ regarding the operation of a crop monitoring system\nwith WSN and IoT technologies\
    \ include the limited computational capabilities of sensor nodes.\nThe restricted\
    \ memory of the nodes disables them to handle large amounts of communication data\n\
    and cluster-based interconnection procedures. Due to this fact, long data queues\
    \ are created in each\nnode, leading to greater delay in transmissions. The same\
    \ outcome can be triggered by the long\ncommunication distance of sensor nodes.\
    \ One major issue that routing algorithms must deal with in\nsuch cases is the\
    \ high level of energy consumption, which leads to a reduction in the overall\
    \ viability\nof the network. In precision agriculture monitoring systems routing\
    \ protocols should offer minimum\ndelay, be able to provide efﬁcient services\
    \ in many sensor nodes, while taking into account the limited\nresources. They\
    \ should also be capable of accepting all sorts of environments including severe\
    \ and loss\nenvironments, while providing information security and privacy. Most\
    \ routing protocols use some\nlocalization technique to obtain knowledge concerning\
    \ their locations. The performance of the routing\nprotocol is a function of network\
    \ size and transmission media. Therefore, transmission media of good\nquality\
    \ enhances the network performance directly.\nHowever, in many cases the failure\
    \ of such advanced monitoring system may be due to the\ngeographic, cultural or\
    \ socio-economic distance between system designers and the intended user\ncommunity.\
    \ Cost is an important limiting factor in the implementation of such systems.\
    \ The cost\ndepends to a great extent on the quality of the materials and the\
    \ topology of the network.\n10. Conclusions\nThis paper proposes the architectural\
    \ components of a smart farming monitoring system, based on\nmodern IoT communication\
    \ technologies and WSN capabilities, in cooperation with energy-saving\nprotocol\
    \ schemes. A use case study based on the DIAS project is also presented, enhancing\
    \ the reliability\nand contribution of our model. The IoT agricultural applications\
    \ enable farmers to collect and analyze\nmeaningful data. Large landowners and\
    \ small farmers should welcome the potential of IoT market\nfor agriculture by\
    \ installing smart technologies to increase competitiveness and sustainability\
    \ in their\nproductions. The rapid growth of population forces farmers to meet\
    \ the demand by implementing\nagricultural IoT solutions in a prosperous manner.\
    \ In the future, an in-depth study will be carried out\nregarding the real-time\
    \ performance of the proposed model in the DIAS project.\nInformation 2019, 10,\

  explanation: Soil moisture sensors and weather stations collect essential time and
    location-based variables to make decisions for agricultural farm management (Coates
    et al. 2013; Díaz et al. 2011; Dong et al. 2013; Yu et al. 2013; Zhang et al.
    2011). WSNs have been deployed in the PA field to collect microclimatological
    data such as temperature, humidity, soil moisture content and wind speed. For
    example, in the Luster project (Selavo et al. 2007), a WSN is used in an environmental
    science system to measure the effect of sunlight on plant growth. Furthermore,
    WSNs have been used to measure crop growth, irrigation and several other applications
    (Baggio 2005; Garcia-Sanchez et al. 2011; Shaikh et al. 2010; Vellidis et al.
    2008). The lifetime of a WSN depends on the power source required by the nodes.
    So selecting the right power source is essential for any PA application.

    Explore all metrics Abstract Precision agriculture (PA) is the use of information
    and communication technology together with best agricultural practices for farm
    management. PA requires the acquisition, transmission and processing of large
    amounts of data from farm fields. A wireless sensor network (WSN) is a system
    for monitoring agriculture fields. Several researchers have used WSNs to collect
    the required data from the regions of interest for their intended usages in various
    applications. In a WSN, the energy consumption of the sensor nodes is the main
    issue, due to its direct impact on the lifetime of the network. Many approaches
    have been proposed to address this issue using different power sources and types
    of nodes. Specifically, in PA, because of the extended time period that is required
    to monitor fields, using an appropriate WSN approach is important. There is a
    need for a comprehensive review of WSN approaches for PA. The aim of this paper
    is to classify and describe the state-of-the-art of WSNs and analyze their energy
    consumption based on their power sources. WSN approaches in PA are categorized
    and discussed according to their features. Similar content being viewed by others

    agriculture (PA) is a concept that combines information technology with agricultural
    principles to manage spatial and temporal variability in the agricultural production
    process. This arrangement may boost agricultural yields whilst reducing harmful
    impact to the environment. One of the efficient technologies that is used to monitor
    and collect data in PA is a wireless sensor network (WSN). WSNs collect data of
    essential spatial and temporal variables that are necessary for decision making
    in agricultural farm management (Coates et al. 2013; Díaz et al. 2011; Dong et
    al. 2013; Yu et al. 2013; Zhang et al. 2011). WSN is a recent novel technology
    that has prospects for improving many applications as well as creating novel systems
    in PA and several other applications, such as global-scale environmental monitoring,
    pest and disease control and animal tracing (Stankovic 2008; Vellidis et al. 2008;
    Vicaire et al. 2009; Wood et al. 2006). In PA, WSNs have been deployed to acquire
    micro-climatological data in farm fields, including temperature, humidity, soil
    moisture content and wind speed. For example, in the Luster project (Selavo et
    al. 2007), a WSN was used in an environmental science system for measuring the
    effect of sunlight on plant growth. Furthermore, WSNs have been used to measure
    crop growth, irrigation and several other applications (Baggio 2005; Garcia-Sanchez
    et al. 2011; Shaikh et al. 2010; Vellidis et al. 2008). In a WSN, the lifetime
    of the network is dependent on the power source requirement of the nodes. Thus,
    selecting a suitable power source for a PA application is essential. The main
    types of power sources are battery or solar power; however, each has its own issues.
    To the best of our knowledge, there are not yet surveys that categorize WSNs for
    PA based on the power source. Ruiz-Garcia et al. (2009) discussed the general
    application area of WSNs in agriculture. They explained different systems that
    are available based on radio frequency identification (RFID) and WSNs. Similarly,
    Wang et al. (2006) explained the available WSN technologies that are applicable
    to agriculture and the food industry. In this paper, first, WSNs and the available
    network topologies are described. Second, the sensor node power sources are categorized
    and discussed in terms of homogeneous and heterogeneous nodes, and their advantages
    and disadvantages are noted. Current approaches and their energy consumption are
    reviewed and described based on these classifications. Third, the approaches are
    summarized and discussed according to their features, applications and technical
    contributions. Wireless sensor networks A WSN is a distributed network of relatively
    small, lightweight wireless nodes that are equipped with sensors (Can and Demirbas
    2013; Owojaiye and Sun 2012; Rathnayaka and Potdar 2013; Van Hoesel et al. 2013).
    Sensor nodes are the basic building blocks of a WSN. A typical node is composed
    of a transceiver, sensor(s), external memory and power source. Figure 1 shows
    the basic architecture of the nodes. The node has the ability to sense, process
    and communicate spatial and temporal variables of interest. Such nodes are deployed
    in areas of interest to work together for environmental or system monitoring (Peng
    and Liu 2012; Stankovic 2008; Vicaire et al. 2009; Wood et al. 2006). Fig. 1 Basic
    architecture of a sensor node Full size image WSN topologies Notable topologies
    mentioned in the literature include the single-star topology (Srbinovska et al.
    2014), mesh topology (Watras et al. 2014), and cluster tree-based topology (Senturk
    and Akkaya 2014). Star single-hop topology In star single-hop topologies, each
    node (or ‘client’) must communicate to other nodes (‘clients’) through a central
    hub (or a ‘server’) or cluster head. The clients do not relay packets through
    other nodes. Instead, each node directly transmits its packet to the cluster head.
    Tongtong et al. (2011) proposed a method of sensing and monitoring the temperature
    and humidity in a greenhouse environment for various distances. It consists of
    one more sensor nodes, some repeat nodes, one main node, PC Terminal, MYSQL (an
    open source relational database management system), web service and one real time
    alarm system. Based on this system, the temperature and humidity parameters can
    be sensed and monitored. They then used the database and web service to record
    the parameters at specific times. Finally, a curve showing the measurement differences
    from the sensing module is drawn by the web server. If the curve depicts abnormal
    changes in the temperature and humidity measurements, an alarm system is triggered,
    which informs the monitor to take required action. In this system, although the
    wireless transceiver distance was limited by the battery power to just 1.26 m,
    the distance could be increased in steps of 1.26 m for each node. Thus, the total
    distance could be calculated as 1.26 m × [1 + N(repeat nodes)]. Shaikh et al.
    (2010) designed WSN nodes with a protocol that ensured low power consumption in
    their development of a cost-efficient crop irrigation control system. The nodes
    are categorized into sensor, actuator and sink nodes, to create a functional architecture.
    The system collects sensor data packets wirelessly via a ZigBee wireless technology
    (Baronti et al. 2007) configuration and transfers them to a connected PC through
    a serial interface. It then sends the request and actuator packet that was generated
    by the acquisition and control/decision support system through the WSN network.
    The network protocol described makes the protocol in this experiment a star single-hop
    topology. With the use of these components and topology, a broadcast based protocol
    called “ProtoSense” was then developed. In this protocol, data request is made
    one level at a time. If the target node is not at one level, it would be forwarded
    to the next level. Hence, this protocol can efficiently optimize power by reducing
    extra communication. It also introduces a request acknowledgement pattern to ensure
    reliability. Cluster tree-based multiple-hop topology In this type of topology,
    two or more star networks communicate through a central hub called a ‘root node’.
    Each sensor node transmits data within a limited radius to reach a nearby cluster
    head. The lower cluster heads then refine the data packets and act as relays to
    further transmit the refined data to a super cluster head or a root node. There
    can be communication among the lower cluster heads via peer-to-peer topologies.
    This type of network structure is implemented in a data aggregation method to
    reduce the energy consumption in the WSN deployment. For example, Nesa Sudha et
    al. (2011) organized sensor nodes into clusters, with one node acting as a cluster
    head and a base station (BS) acting as a super cluster head. This experiment combined
    six sensors per cluster, and there were three clusters in all. The data transmission
    between the BS and cluster heads and also communication between the clusters was
    by time division multiple access (TDMA). The data transmission was based on a
    single-hop from one node to a nearby node. Overall, the network structure of this
    deployment is a cluster tree-based multiple hop topology. Each node is assigned
    a unique identification address and is known to the BS. At any point in time,
    TDMA scheduled any one of the nodes as the cluster head and communicated this
    information to all of the nodes in the cluster. All of the nodes transmit their
    power source information to the BS, and the node with the highest energy level
    in the cluster is assigned to be head of that cluster. Peng and Liu (2012) described
    the implementation of an auto system scheme in which the sensor network nodes
    are combined with fuzzy controller nodes to schedule irrigation. In the design
    structure of the system, the WSN is composed of a sensor node cluster, a co-ordinator
    node and a controller node. Irrigation pipelines are laid across the irrigated
    areas, and electric control valves are installed on the pipelines. The sensor
    nodes collect humidity and temperature data and form sensor clusters based on
    the plant-water status. In the network structure, each sensor node gathers the
    real-time data of its surrounding areas and sends it to the cluster heads. The
    information is further sent to the co-ordinator nodes within a set time period.
    In the co-ordinator node is an embedded fuzzy controller. This controller controls
    the pump valves and decides when to activate the irrigation and for how long.
    The WSN deployment from the data collection to the decision-making point makes
    the network structure a cluster tree-based multiple hop topology. Mesh topology
    In mesh topology, each sensor node communicates to every other sensor node and
    acts as a relay to transmit data from the other nodes in the network. Gao et al.
    (2013) proposed an intelligent irrigation system based on a WSN and fuzzy control.
    The objective was to solve issues of soil fertility loss and water wastage in
    irrigation. The system was composed of sensor nodes and the controller node; additionally,
    soil moisture sensors, irrigation pipes, spray irrigation and irrigation control
    valves were deployed. The ZigBee network was adopted in the mesh network topology.
    While the sensor nodes acted as terminal nodes in the field, some sensors nodes
    were selected as routers. These router nodes collected data from the terminal
    nodes and transmitted them to a head node, called sink node, which gathers and
    controls data collected by other nodes. A control panel was introduced as the
    control node. Data were acquired at periodic intervals; the control valve opened
    and closed the irrigation process depending on the command received. Vellidis
    et al. (2013) reported on use of a mesh network-based soil moisture sensing WSN
    in combination with variable rate irrigation (VRI) at the 2013 European conference
    on precision agriculture. Majone et al. (2013) monitored soil moisture dynamics
    in the top soil to analyze the interplay between soil moisture dynamics and plant
    physiology. Their experiment used a multi-hop WSN that was connected across several
    soil and temperature nodes that were deployed across 27 locations. The sensor
    nodes were connected to an input/output interface through a node called TinyNode
    584 (Dubois-Ferrière et al. 2006) WSN platform, which was developed by SHOCKFISH
    company, Lausanne, Switzerland. Power sources WSNs have been proposed to detect
    and monitor spatial and temporal parameters (Garcia-Sanchez et al. 2011; Peres
    et al. 2011; Zhang et al. 2012). The results are then used to control the levels
    of parameters to suit specific plant soil requirements and to provide event services.
    An example is the use of a WSN for intelligent diagnosis services and to schedule
    irrigation management. Power is required for WSN devices throughout their period
    of operation (Anastasi et al. 2009; Anisi et al. 2013b). There are two main types
    of power source: battery and solar. Battery sources Although batteries are relatively
    low cost and small size, continuous exposure to high temperature levels in fields
    have other undesirable effects, such as a shortened cycle life and an increased
    rate of self-discharge (Park et al. 2005). Short time battery life is a limitation
    on long-term monitoring. Rechargeable batteries can be used as a source of power
    to make up for the energy depletion in the sensor nodes. Homogeneous battery-based
    power approaches In homogenous WSNs, all of the sensor nodes possess the same
    network attributes in terms of their computational capability, battery power and
    transmission radius (Hou et al. 2005). All of the sensor nodes are identical,
    and all of the nodes might have the same lifetime. The advantage of using homogeneous
    nodes is that they are less complicated and uniform in their maintenance requirements.
    All of the sensor nodes could also be low-cost. In terms of cluster formation,
    any one of them can be selected as a cluster head. However, due to the continuous
    processing of data in terms of aggregation and protocol co-ordination and the
    long-range communication that are maintained with the remote BS, the co-ordinator
    nodes could become overloaded. As they have the same power resource as the other
    sensor nodes, their energy depletes faster resulting in premature failure (Mhatre
    and Rosenberg 2004). Vellidis et al. (2008) proposed a system in which multiple
    homogenous sensor nodes were used for monitoring soil moisture and temperature
    to schedule irrigation in a cotton farm. There was single-hop data transmission
    of data via RFID to a fixed central receiving unit. A laptop connected to the
    receiver was placed at one end of the field. The sensor nodes were composed of
    sensors, a sensor circuit board, and an RFID tag. At periodic intervals, the smart
    sensor board acquired sensor values and transmitted those values wirelessly to
    the receiver. The presence of plant biomass, terrain and objects imposed transmission
    difficulties during field testing of the prototype. This difficulty was solved
    when tags were removed from the electronic boards and mounted on hollow flexible
    fiberglass rods at approximately 1.2 m above ground level. A large number of sensor
    nodes were deployed to cover a large area. However, such a large number of nodes
    can cause interference problems which may result in more packet loss. A sensor
    circuit board which was called “smart sensor board” was supported by battery power.
    The micro-controller switched to sleep mode between sensor readings and data transmission.
    Sub-circuits also went ON and OFF as required. The microcontroller transmitted
    an alarm code when the voltage dropped below an acceptable threshold. This was
    meant to send an alarm and thereby avoid regular inspections. This method of power
    management increased the battery life through the growing season. Although some
    energy consumption reduction methods were implemented to conserve power, the approach
    was still not energy efficient. This is because the approach gathered data by
    using single-hop transmission of data from the multiple nodes in the field to
    the centrally fixed receiving unit. This method does not balance the energy expenditure
    to the multiple sensor nodes in the field. The energy levels of the nodes located
    farther away from the sink would deplete faster due to more transmission power
    required for long transmission ranges. Most of those sensor nodes would fail before
    their counterparts closer to the sink. Therefore, the energy of the network is
    unbalanced and thus, the network lifetime may be short. Baggio (2005) instrumented
    a potato field to monitor micro-climate: humidity, temperature and weather. This
    action was intended to reveal when the crop was at risk of developing a phytophtora
    disease. The experiment was also to collect statistics on the behavior of the
    WSN in a real-world experiment. Furthermore, the robustness of the energy-efficient
    T-MAC (Van Dam and Langendoen 2003) protocol was also tested. The sensor nodes
    used in the experiment were called TNOdes. These nodes were deployed across the
    field with some of them acting as relays. These relays were without sensors. These
    homogeneous sensor nodes measured the climatological conditions. A weather station
    was also installed on the field to register luminosity, precipitation, wind strength
    and direction. Soil moisture, which is a critical factor for micro-climate and
    development of diseases, was measured by a number of sensors. A sensor to measure
    the height of the groundwater table was installed. The nodes collected and transmitted
    infield data to a so-called field gateway, which also forwarded the data to a
    low frequency array (LOFAR) gateway by Wi-Fi. LOFAR is the low-frequency array
    for radio astronomy built by ASTRON organization in the Netherlands. The LOFAR
    gateway was connected to the internet through cable, and data were uploaded to
    a LOFAR server and further distributed to a couple of other servers using the
    extensible mark-up language (XML) format. The data on the behavior of the WSN,
    which was gathered during the experiment, served as a foundation for WSN algorithm
    simulations to check failed connections and dead nodes. A number of methods were
    adopted to ensure optimal utilization of the power source and to extend the lifetime
    of the sensor nodes. For example, the nodes reported data only every 10 min. The
    data sent over the wireless link was minimized by the delta encoding technique
    (Mogul et al. 1997) which is a data compression technique for efficient data storage.
    Data compression over radio communication lines was also considered. An energy-efficiency
    protocol called T-MAC was introduced, and it was implemented on the radio with
    a duty cycle of 7 %. Furthermore, some methods also ensured reliable data delivery
    to the LOFAR gateway, in such a way as to avert data loss. A multi-hop routing
    protocol (MintRoute) was proposed and used to maintain reliability of the WSN.
    This method reveals when the crop is at risk of developing disease and informs
    the farmer to appropriately treat the field or parts of it with fungicide. Their
    approach, with nodes reporting data every 10 min, was designed to save power.
    Furthermore, to balance energy, the multi-hop routing protocol of TinyOS (Levis
    et al. 2005), an application-specific operation system for WSN, was used to send
    data. Their approach was energy-efficient as it combined both energy balancing
    and energy consumption methods. Nesa Sudha et al. (2011) proposed an energy-efficient
    TDMA-based algorithm for wireless sensor communications in an automatic irrigation
    system. Their experiment involved a header node that collected data directly from
    all of the nodes in the field and passed them to the BS. Such a network arrangement
    made it a star single-hop topology. Direct communication is maintained between
    the sensor nodes and the BS in the data accumulation process, whereby the header
    node does not work on the collected data except to directly transmit it to the
    BS. The process starts by the BS assigning unique identification addresses to
    each of the nodes. The nodes went into a sleep state (or into a receiving mode)
    after acquiring the address. To obtain data at a specific location, the BS sent
    a broadcast request to all of the nodes, but only the addressed node responded
    with its present temperature and moisture values. The BS received values from
    all of the areas by repeating this process for all of the nodes in its address
    table. In this approach, the medium access control (MAC) (I.C.S.L.M.S. Committee
    1997) protocol was used to control energy consumption. Sensor nodes turned ON/OFF
    their radio according to a schedule to save energy. The approach verifies that
    data fusion (aggregation) in which nodes were grouped into clusters was more energy
    efficient than direct communication in which each node transmitted data directly
    to the sink. In energy conservation, a distributed TDMA-based scheme which leads
    to collision free transmission over the data channel was used. This reduced the
    energy consumption by each node thereby reducing the overall energy consumption.
    This approach could therefore extend the network lifetime. Heterogeneous battery-based
    power approaches In a heterogeneous WSN, nodes in the network have different network
    attributes (Hou et al. 2005). This type of network is usually associated with
    a hierarchical sensor network in which relatively low resource sensor nodes are
    deployed at the lower level. Additionally, higher resource sensor nodes are made
    into co-ordinator and sink nodes. In fact, in heterogeneous networks, only the
    co-ordinators and cluster heads might require higher resources. This arrangement
    is to enable the cluster head to receive data from sensor nodes and process it
    for the BS, to support data aggregation and protocol co-ordination. Providing
    more power source for cluster heads extends their lifetime under high loads. In
    addition, this arrangement could increase the cost and complexity. Zhang et al.
    (2012) proposed a WSN-based system to monitor the soil moisture and analyzed the
    temporal and spatial variability of soil moisture for variable irrigation. According
    to Fig. 2, the system architecture included heterogeneous sensor nodes and sink
    nodes and a remote management platform. The sensor nodes in the field collected
    and sent soil moisture data periodically to the sink nodes. Sink nodes that acted
    as gateways to the general packet radio service (GPRS) sent the data to the remote
    management platform via the TCP-IP standard protocol. The platform that was based
    on the BS mode could collect, store and analyze data and output the report forms.
    The sensor node positions were measured with a global positioning system (GPS).
    Additionally, the distance between the nodes was established according to the
    real field situation, the signal transmission distance and the spatial variability
    in the soil moisture. The core module of the sensor node was a wireless microprocessor
    from Crossbow Company, California, USA. The frequency domain measurement method
    to determine the dielectric constant of soil was used to calculate soil moisture.
    Both the sensor nodes and the soil moisture sensors were waterproofed to withstand
    harsh conditions. The power source to sustain the network operation was from a
    battery. Additionally, the soil moisture sensors were always in sleep mode and
    were activated only when data were to be collected. Multi-hop and self-organizing
    nodes were also used to guarantee network connectivity. The authors designed and
    developed a multi-channel interface, peripheral bus and solar power system. Fig.
    2 Architecture of the soil moisture real-time monitoring system (Zhang et al.
    2012) Full size image The data collected was processed and analyzed by classical
    statistical methods. With a combination of soil moisture monitoring sensors, WSN
    and spatial analysis software, their method gathers and transmits soil moisture
    data to remote management systems automatically. The method used in the research
    to develop the soil distribution system was simple, and the system offers valuable
    information as the basis to make irrigation decisions. Soil moisture sensor nodes
    sent data to the sink node every 30 min. This would reduce the energy consumption
    of the sensor nodes. Soil moisture sensors were activated to collect data only
    when the data was needed which would also reduce the energy consumption. The multi-hop
    method of transferring data enables the nodes to transmit data to neighbor nodes
    for onward forwarding to the sink, instead of the case in single-hop data transmission
    in which the power source of remotely located nodes would be exhausted quickly.
    Yu et al. (2013) proposed a hybrid architecture involving WSN and wireless underground
    sensor networks (WUSN). An implementation framework was then developed for real-time
    soil property monitoring. The impact of soil parameters, node depth, signal frequency
    and attenuation on transmission were studied. Reflection, scattering and diffraction
    may occur in the soil and at the soil–air interface during data transmission.
    The experiment revealed that the frequency of the electromagnetic signals and
    the water content of soil affect the path loss. As depicted in the Peplinski principle
    (Peplinski et al., 1995), γ = α + jβ, with $$ \alpha \, = \omega \sqrt {\frac{{\mu
    \varepsilon^{''} }}{2}\left[ {\sqrt {1 + \left( {\frac{{\varepsilon^{''''} }}{{\varepsilon^{''}
    }}} \right)^{2} } - 1} \right]} $$ (1) $$ \beta \, = \omega \sqrt {\frac{{\mu
    \varepsilon^{''} }}{2}\left[ {\sqrt {1 + \left( {\frac{{\varepsilon^{''''} }}{{\varepsilon^{''}
    }}} \right)^{2} } + 1} \right]} $$ (2) where ω = 2πf is the angular frequency,
    μ is the magnetic permeability, and ε′ and ε″ are the real and imaginary parts
    of the dielectric constant, respectively. The system architecture used CC2430,
    a wireless transceiver chip based on ZigBee by Texas Instruments, USA, which was
    developed to gather soil terrestrial information. The WUSN used NRF905 wireless
    chip manufactured by Nordic Semi-Conductor Company, Oslo, Norway, to collect and
    transmit information underground (UG). The hybrid system topology is a combination
    of terrestrial and WUSN structures and is illustrated in Fig. 3. The WSN was installed
    above 0.4 m depth while the WUSN was below 0.4 m. The sink node of the WUSN is
    placed on the ground. All WUSN nodes transmit data to the terrestrial sink node
    with their location based on the applications. The sink node is also said to be
    static or mobile provided it is within the communication range. WUSN is set up
    by placing underground sensors in the field, while deploying data sinks above
    the ground located around the field. Mobile data sinks are carried by people or
    machines in the field. The results of the experiment reveal that at low frequency
    signals and low volumetric water content, signal attenuation and bit error rate
    are minimal. The path loss is also influenced by depth of the WUSN. Fig. 3 Topology
    structure of WUSN Full size image In the authors’ test model, sensors are buried
    at depths of 0.8, 1, 1.6 and 2 m, which implies a large power source requirement.
    The UG nodes would have to expend a lot of energy in a single-hop to transmit
    data to the sink node located aboveground. Thus the nodes power sources could
    deplete quickly thereby shortening the network lifetime. Kim et al. (2011) designed
    and developed a sensor network architecture using autonomous robots with beacons
    to monitor and detect fires and air pollution in fields. The authors built a conceptual
    linear topology and implemented it in a tree-based network topology. Sensor modules
    were developed using a RF transceiver with model number CC2420, a single-chip
    2.4 GHz IEEE 802.15.4 designed for low power and low voltage wireless applications
    by Texas Instruments, USA. Also, a micro controller with model number ATMega128L
    by Atmel corporation, California, USA was used. The application was to monitor
    the temperature, gas, smoke, humidity and illumination. The data collected was
    forwarded to a co-ordinator node every few seconds. Then, the co-ordinator sends
    the data to a specific processor called a knowledge information processor for
    agriculture-sensor data and fire-sensor data (KIP-AF) which shows the measured
    values in real time. For any data that arrives at the KIP-AF, the server transmits
    an alert message to the end user while using the ZigBee enabled SIM (ZSIM). Three
    types of nodes used in the scheme were the wireless co-ordinator (WC), the wireless
    router (WR), and the wireless end device (WED). The WC was the sink node and gateway,
    and it transmitted periodic beacon frames as well as collected data from the WRs
    and WEDs. The study used heterogeneous sensor nodes made up of one co-ordinator
    node, eight routers or parent nodes and 50 sensor nodes (WED) and a tree-based
    network topology with a maximum of three hops. A conceptual network topology that
    models the implementation architecture of the system is shown in Fig. 4. All of
    the sensor nodes transmitted packets in every transmission interval to process
    emergency data. At every interval, all of the sensor nodes transmit their sensing
    data to the WC, which then forwards it to the KIP-AF. This processor maintained
    the agricultural database for intelligent decisions and further analysis. When
    KIP-AF detects emergency conditions such as fire and dangerous air pollution,
    it immediately informs the remote user via a ZSIM terminal. To gather wide-area
    data from the farm, the study introduced mobile robots to cover areas that were
    inaccessible to the fixed nodes. Therefore, the sensor nodes in the field were
    heterogeneous, comprising mobile and static nodes. However, mobility leads to
    link failures due to network handover or loss of line of sight (LOS). The solution
    to this problem was for the mobile robots to scan for an alternative path to move
    to the WC. This action was performed by using the best link quality indicator
    (LQI) among the scanned WR candidates. Figure 5 shows the handover scenario of
    the mobile nodes. The second approach was to increase the RF power of the robot
    by adopting power amplifier and low noise amplifier (LNA) functions in such a
    way as to double the transmission range. Batteries were used as the power source.
    Fig. 4 System implementation architecture Full size image Fig. 5 Mobile handover
    scenario for router recovery (Kim et al. 2011) Full size image The packet loss
    rate from the WED to the WC was measured to be less than 4 %, and the numerical
    expression to calculate it is given as: $$ \frac{{{\text{N}}_{\text{Fail}} }}{{{\text{N}}_{{{\text{Fail}}}}+
    {\text{N}}_{{\text{Re} {\text{c}}}} }} \times 100 $$ (3) where \( {\text{N}}_{\text{Fail}}
    \) and \( {\text{N}}_{\text{Rec}} \) are the number of failed packets to transmit
    to the co-ordinator and the number of successfully received packets in the co-ordinator,
    respectively. Additionally, at any time that the mobile node executes a handover
    procedure, the average handover latency \( {\text{T}}_{\text{HO}} \) is calculated
    by using the expression: $$ {\text{T}}_{\text{HO }} = {\text{T}}_{{{\text{beacon}}\_{\text{loss}}}}
    + {\text{T}}_{{{\text{asc}}\_{\text{req}}}} + {\text{T}}_{\text{ack}} + {\text{T}}_{{{\text{data}}\_{\text{req}}}}
    + {\text{T}}_{\text{ack}} + {\text{T}}_{{{\text{asc}}\_{\text{res }}}} \, + \,{\text{T}}_{\text{ack}}
    $$ (4) where \( {\text{T}}_{{{\text{beacon}}\_{\text{loss}}}} \) is the interval
    of the beacon loss due to the handover, \( {\text{T}}_{{{\text{asc}}\_{\text{req}}}}
    \) is the transmission time of the association request frame, \( {\text{T}}_{{{\text{asc}}\_{\text{res
    }}}} \)is the transmission time of the association response frame, \( {\text{T}}_{{{\text{data}}\_{\text{req}}}}
    \) is the transmission time of the data request frame and \( {\text{T}}_{\text{ack}}
    \)is the transmission time of the acknowledgement frame. The most important concern
    is for reliable data transmission of real-time conditions without energy losses
    at the sensor nodes which could affect the network lifetime. Duty cycle is fixed
    at 100 %; this suggests that all sensor nodes transmit data to the WC at every
    transmission window in order to process data for onward forwarding to the sink.
    This may increase network traffic thereby causing packet collisions; retransmissions
    could lead to faster power source depletion. Solar power Batteries can limit the
    functionality of WSNs due to their low capacities but a solar energy harvesting
    module could fully meet the needs of practical applications in PA. Sensor network
    survival no longer depends on battery life. However, a solar harvesting system
    is more expensive to run than battery-based approaches and energy from the sun
    is not always available. Moreover, it has the disadvantage of being obtrusive.
    The solar panel must be mounted above the canopy and generally is an impediment
    to field operations. Homogeneous solar-based power approaches Hedley et al. (2012)
    developed a WSN soil moisture mapping and monitoring method to provide information
    for irrigation scheduling. Data were presented in digital format for incorporating
    into the VRI controlling software. The research was conducted in a 75 ha wheat
    field. The irrigation was by a center pivot (CP) irrigator with VRI modification.
    Each sprinkler was controlled individually by digital maps uploaded to a central
    controller. Sensors were combined with a real-time kinematic differential global
    positioning system (RTK-DGPS) to measure soil and land parameters. Data loggers
    were mounted on a vehicle to acquire high resolution vertical mode datasets in
    two separate surveys. The field was segmented into three classes, and homogeneous
    sensor nodes were deployed in each class. The nodes were organized in a mesh-structured
    topology and had a range of up to 1 km in LOS. For energy efficiency, the nodes
    switched into a sleep mode when they were in an idle state. Each node was attached
    with: (1) two Delta-T SM300 moisture sensors installed at 0.2 and 0.5 m depth
    to monitor the volumetric soil moisture content (v/v), (2) a Spectrum Technologies
    Watermark soil matric potential sensor that was installed at 0.2 m depth to monitor
    the soil moisture tension, and (3) a tensiometer equipped with an absolute pressure
    transducer, to assess the depth of the water table, was installed at 1 m depth.
    A rain gauge was also attached to one node, to monitor the irrigation and rainfall
    events. Data were relayed to a BS every 15 min; it was processed in real-time
    and converted to the necessary format and immediately made available through a
    3G cellular modem via the internet to a webpage. End users could access the web
    site. This WSN method provided a direct measure of the soil moisture status and
    the need for irrigation. It has the advantages of using site-specific real-time
    soil moisture data and site-specific climatic conditions to schedule the irrigation.
    Therefore, (1) there is no need to know the plant type, (2) there is no need to
    know the plant growth stage, (3) uncertainties (errors) when estimating the evaporation–transpiration
    (ET) are avoided, (4) there is no need to know any of the variables needed to
    estimate the ET, such as the air temperature, relative humidity (RH), radiation,
    soil temperature and wind conditions. In order to conserve power, the sensor nodes
    relayed data to the BS every 15 min. Mafuta et al. (2013) designed a WSN for PA
    in Malawi and called it the WiPAM. This system was intended to automate the irrigation
    process and implement an irrigation management system (IMS). The authors investigated
    variability in soil moisture. Information on the variability was then used by
    the irrigation controller to initiate irrigation events. For precise irrigation,
    an irrigation event was triggered occasionally. The sensor nodes were homogeneous,
    and each was composed of a ZigBee end device (ZED) and a ZigBee co-ordinator (ZC).
    In the star topology, three sensors nodes were configured as ZED (in field-nodes)
    and one as a gateway node. One other node was also configured as ZC with the function
    to aggregate data and actuate the irrigation valves. The network topology is shown
    in Fig. 6. Fig. 6 The architecture of the irrigation system Full size image To
    operate the network, ZED collected soil moisture and temperature data at predefined
    time intervals. Sampled data were sent and stored in a co-ordinator node. The
    co-ordinator node then sent the data to a gateway node, which also transmitted
    the data to a remote monitoring station (RMS) through a cellular network. The
    power source to sustain the operation of the network was solar power. This approach
    was complemented by an energy-efficient management approach. In other words, sensor
    nodes went to sleep when idle and woke up to repeat the previous steps when required.
    The irrigation valves opened or closed depending on the values that were stored
    in the co-ordinator node. The WiPAM was composed of two sections: the irrigation
    station (IS) and the RMS. The sections were linked through a cellular network,
    as shown in Fig. 7. The RMS captured the performance parameters of the IS at the
    remote site. The parameters were the soil moisture level, the soil temperature,
    the battery voltage levels of the sensor nodes, the quality of the wireless links,
    and the valve status. The main contribution of this paper is the design, implementation
    and performance enhancement of a low-cost and efficient IMS that combines sensors
    and actuators in a wireless sensor/actuator network. Fig. 7 Irrigation management
    system architecture Full size image To attain low power consumption, the protocol,
    operating at low data rate (250 kbps at 2.4 GHz), was used to gather data. Other
    technologies such as Bluetooth (802.15.1) and Wi-Fi (802.11) consume more battery
    power although they offer higher data rates. Moreover, in PA, some sensor data
    do not require wide bandwidth since it is not necessary to continuously monitor
    soil moisture and temperature. Using ZC to aggregate data before actuating an
    irrigation valve could reduce energy consumption. The approach further conserved
    power by putting the ZEDs to sleep and only waking them up to make measurements.
    The sensor data were collected at intervals of 30 min when the system was idle
    and 2 min when irrigation was taking place. This arrangement could further reduce
    energy consumption. In general, this approach could be said to be energy sufficient
    as it incorporated a number of energy reduction methods. Majone et al. (2013)
    described the deployment of a WSN in an apple orchard. The goal was to monitor
    soil moisture dynamics in the top soil to analyze interaction with plant physiology.
    In the experiment, several homogeneous sensor nodes were deployed in a multi-hop
    wireless mesh topology. The sensor nodes were connected across several soil and
    temperature nodes and were deployed across 27 locations. The sensor nodes were
    connected through an input/output interface to a TinyNode 584 WSN platform. A
    solar power source supplied energy to the network. Some energy-efficient management
    approaches were adopted to minimize energy consumption. Real-time monitoring of
    the system began with measurement at each node of the battery and solar panel
    voltages and the internal voltage as well as the temperature of the micro-controller.
    On-board software routines were based on the TinyOS-2.x operating system. The
    process to acquire data started every 10 min, and between every two consecutive
    measurements, the sensor nodes went into sleep mode. Unnecessary modules [such
    as radio frequency (RF), module and sensor] were switched off. This action decreased
    the power consumption to a minimum of approximately 80 µA at 6 V. The energy consumption
    fluctuated from the start to end of data collection. Sensor nodes sent data to
    the sink node. The sink nodes then measured the received signal strength indicator
    (RSSI) value of every packet and forwarded the data packets to a PC gateway (GW)
    over the serial port. The packets were assigned a date and time, and the raw data
    were forwarded to a MySQL database for real time and historic management. These
    data were eventually converted and calibrated by specific equations and were displayed
    by dynamic PHP web pages. The experiment showed that sensors at shallow depths
    responded more quickly than those at larger depths. The nodes which were placed
    at lower depth measured high values of volumetric water content compared to the
    nodes at higher depths. Moreover, the nodes at higher depth had lower response
    time due to higher attenuation. It appears that this approach employed two contrasting
    methods in terms of energy efficiency. On the one hand, the approach may have
    conserved energy by putting the sensor nodes into low power mode (also called
    sleep mode) and switching off every unnecessary module (such as RF, module and
    sensor). However, a mesh network topology to enable multi-hop data transmissions
    was used and all the data were sent over a radio channel to a sink node. This
    means that all the nodes were awake and actively sending or providing pathways
    for one another to the sink node, thereby wasting power source in the process.
    The inference made is that the data were sent in raw form without any form of
    data compression or aggregation and this could have generated packet losses and
    retransmissions. Again since all nodes sent data to only one sink, the sink could
    over work thus depleting power source faster. This approach may not be energy
    efficient and, therefore, could have short network lifetime. Heterogeneous solar-based
    power approaches Peres et al. (2011) designed an intelligent autonomous gateway,
    which was called intelligent precision agriculture gateway (iPAGAT). The goal
    of iPAGAT was to function as an interface device that processes in-field data
    by performing data aggregation and integration. The processed information would
    then be transmitted to high-level decision support systems for farm managers to
    make decisions. iPAGAT used Bluetooth, IEEE 802.11 and GPRS to communicate with
    local and remote users. The power source for the system was solar power with a
    rechargeable battery, to increase the network lifetime. In the experiment, the
    communication was based on five layers. The layers were labeled as L1–5. L1 involves
    the function of using WSN to gather environmental data from the vineyard management
    zones. L2 devices function to co-ordinate the WSN and process the L1 data by means
    of data aggregation techniques. The L2 layer also acts as an access point to a
    site-specific management application and serves as a gateway to L3, which is the
    layer that has the function to manage the entire farm. Layers L4 and L5 are farmer
    associations and country policies, which are outside the scope of this paper.
    There are three methods of communication in the system set up: (1) the link between
    the WSN and gateway (i.e., the L1–L2 connections), (2) the link between the gateway
    and local user (with a smartphone), through Bluetooth and/or IEEE 802.11, and
    (3) the link between the gateway and farm management office through GSM/GPRS and/or
    IEEE 802.11. In the experiment, small stationary and heterogeneous data acquisition
    nodes were deployed across the field in a mesh network topology according to the
    ZigBee standard. The co-ordinator of this network is situated at the gateway of
    the infrastructure; it manages the WSN and also acts as a sink node for the collected
    data. It fed data into the gateway database which aggregated the collected data
    and made the compressed data available to local and remote users through web services.
    The solar panel uses Bluetooth and IEEE 802.11 technologies to communicate with
    the system devices. The iPAGAT served multiple functions: an environmental repository
    for the collected data, a sink node for the WSN, an aggregation engine and a Real-time
    alert system (RTAS). The management levels of the system are shown in Fig. 8.
    Fig. 8 Management level scenario (Peres et al. 2011) Full size image The RTAS
    embedded in the IPAGAT for disease prediction was a large advantage of the system.
    However, iPAGAT was rather complex and not easy to understand. Data were collected
    through multi-hop mesh network with clusters. In this way, the load was distributed
    among the cluster heads without overloading some specific nodes. Moreover, the
    collected data was summarized by a data aggregation method before transmission
    to the next layer. In this way, only compressed data was transmitted and the system
    avoided frame collisions and packet losses. In the light of the above, this approach
    could be described as being energy efficient since it combined both energy balancing
    and energy reduction methods in the data collection process. Garcia-Sanchez et
    al. (2011) proposed a system to monitor crop fields. The system could detect and
    identify procedures of a WSN video surveillance system. It also monitored, detected,
    identified and transmitted data over long distances in distributed crops. The
    authors designed an integrated wireless sensor networks solution for PA (ISSPA)
    and added it to the basic PA mechanisms. The system integrated video transmission
    to networks which hitherto only monitored crops. The system was, therefore, able
    to reduce the cost, increase the cycle lifetime of the devices and networks, and
    avoid duplicate infrastructure. The ISSPA synchronized the duty and sleep phases
    for the heterogeneous sensor nodes in the system. This goal was accomplished by
    the use of message forwarding techniques and multi-interface routing devices.
    All of the communications issues conformed to IEEE802.15.4 technology and allowed
    co-operation between several communication nodes. Another contribution of the
    system was the design and implementation of IEEE 802.15.4 real-devices that avoided
    frame collisions in the message transmissions and performance of their specific
    functions (i.e., crop monitoring, video surveillance) within the agronomic cycle
    for the crop of interest. This system provided the necessary hardware and software
    for monitoring farm field parameters such as temperature, humidity and soil nutrient
    level. It also detected and identified the procedures of a WSN video-surveillance
    system. Devices used in the study were categorized into five groups based on their
    functionality. The categories were the monitoring group, detection group, identification
    group, crop-gateway and farmer Co-op-gateway. All of the components of these nodes
    and gateways were encased for protection against dust and rain. For each type
    of device, appropriate commercialized hardware was selected, and appropriate software
    was developed to achieve functionality. These assorted nodes incorporated appropriate
    sensors together with wireless communication modules. The resulting devices were
    able to acquire data from different sensors, such as salinity, PH, temperature
    and soil moisture. Furthermore, motion detectors and identification sensors existed
    for video surveillance and crop security and control. Sensors collected appropriate
    data and transmitted it to the Gateway through a communication module, which then
    delivered the information to the Farmers’ Co-operative. The Co-operative then
    provided each farmer with information on his crops in real time. The farmer received
    the information at home via the internet on a PDA or Mobile handset. The system
    architecture is shown in Fig. 9. Solar power supplied the required power for the
    devices. Fig. 9 System architecture (Garcia-Sanchez et al. 2011) Full size image
    The approach used cluster-tree network topology to collect the required data from
    the sensor nodes. Then the ISSPA co-ordinated the information transmission from
    the cluster nodes and so reduced power consumption and frame collision probability.
    To further conserve power, IEEE 802.15.4 real devices were implemented. This suggests
    there were no retransmissions, thereby conserving power. Video-surveillance, which
    was used over the crop areas to capture, process and send pictures to the BS,
    may imply high energy consumption. The video messages, along with the monitoring
    data transmission coming from many sensors placed in separated crops could also
    provoke frame collisions and, consequently, losses. The issue could be more critical
    when several cameras are considered. The retransmission of monitoring messages
    may also cause more energy consumption. To mitigate the shortcomings, an ISSPA
    mechanism was again used. The mechanism provides an appropriate synchronization
    of duty and sleep phases for all nodes in the system using message forwarding
    techniques and multi-interface routing devices. Even though the approach used
    power-hungry devices such as video cameras in its implementation, it co-ordinated
    the data transmission from the nodes of the cluster network. Additionally, it
    reduced frame collision probability which prevented packet retransmission; thereby,
    mitigating the power consumption. Dong et al. (2013) provide a proof-of-concept
    towards an autonomous PA system by integrating a CP irrigation system with a WUSN.
    The system provides autonomous irrigation management capabilities by monitoring
    the soil conditions in real time using WUSN. The results are used to evaluate
    empirical channel models for soil–air communications. Their experiment proved
    that the concept of WUSN-CP was feasible. They designed an UG antenna to improve
    the communication range. In the experiment, above-ground nodes (AG nodes) were
    installed on the arm of a CP irrigation system, while UG nodes were buried at
    depth of 0.35 m in the field in a circle. The CP rotated in both clockwise and
    anti-clockwise directions. At suitable range, the AG nodes established communication
    with the UG nodes. Two antenna schemes were used: firstly, a full-wave (FW) dipole
    antenna for the AG node and secondly, a single ended elliptical antenna (SEA)
    for the UG. While the former has a gain of 3 dB, the latter used a directional
    Yagi antenna (Pozar 2000) for the AG node and a circular planar antenna for the
    UG nodes. The Yagi antenna has a higher directivity with a maximum gain of 10
    dB. Both the SEA antenna and the circular planar antenna are customized according
    to the operation range. A TinyOS application was developed to analyze the experiment
    without the need to reprogram the sensors. An AG node located on the CP maintains
    unicast communication with a UG node buried UG within their communication window.
    This suggests that the power source was only spent in transmitting data directly
    from one node to the other. Since data was not broadcast, it implies that other
    sensor nodes would not participate in data transmissions thereby conserving power.
    Moreover, no intermediate nodes were required in the data transfer; the source
    and sink nodes were therefore peer-to-peer. From the system structure, there could
    be delays in the spinning of the CP to reach a particular node. However, this
    delay may be acceptable in the application area of PA, since such delay is insufficient
    to cause significant difference in the measured parameters. This approach could
    therefore, be said to be energy efficient in the light of the foregoing observations.
    Discussion Table 1 compares WSN approaches based on their applications, features
    and contributions as used in PA. The table shows that the proposed WSN applications
    solutions are in irrigation scheduling, although other areas such as pollution
    and fire detection are also exploited. The major contributions of the discussed
    approaches could be categorized into data transmission reliability, energy efficiency
    and efficient scheduling of the nodes specifically for irrigation control. Several
    approaches (Fernandes et al. 2013; Peres et al. 2011) have adopted data aggregation
    techniques to collect the required data which is a technique known for the reduction
    of communication overhead and energy expenditure of nodes in WSN (Anisi et al.
    2013a; Nesa Sudha et al. 2011; Theodoridis et al. 2012). Moreover, WSN approaches
    must consider the type of topology to use and whether the sensor nodes are homogeneous
    or heterogeneous. Finally, a critical consideration identified was the use of
    appropriate power source to extend the network lifetime. Table 1 Features of WSN
    approaches in PA Full size table In general, energy-efficient routing for extending
    the network lifetime is provided by two methods: (1) energy balancing, in which
    overloading and multi-functioning of certain specific nodes is prevented, and
    the residual energy of the sensor nodes is monitored; and (2) energy consumption
    reduction to mitigate the average energy consumption of the network using methods
    such as clustering, reducing the number of messages, reducing overhead and establishing
    co-operative communications. In Table 2, the approaches have been classified according
    to the energy efficient methods used. Table 2 Energy efficient methods Full size
    table Conclusions A WSN is an efficient monitoring technique for use in PA. In
    this paper, the state-of-the-art of WSNs has been discussed and reviewed. To achieve
    this goal, first, the various topologies of WSN approaches, including star single-hop,
    cluster tree-based multi-hop and mesh networks, were described. Due to the vital
    role of energy in a WSN, the sources of power in WSN approaches, including battery
    and solar power, were described. Second, the current WSN approaches that are used
    in PA based on the power source and the type of the node were categorized and
    reviewed. Third, the approaches based on the applications, features and technical
    contributions of the WSN were outlined. Abbreviations AG: Above ground BS: Base

  extract_1: Smart Agriculture presently lacks an Internet of Things (IoT) platform
    for the gathering, preprocessing, and storage of data used in irrigation management,
    which also allows for the reuse of code to different sets of crops, soil, irrigation
    system, and weather data sources. In this paper, we have proposed the Smart&Green
    IoT framework which executes an irrigation management plan using the water balance
    and potential matric approaches according to the crop, as well as irrigation system
    information provided by users and the weather and soil moisture data available
    close to the monitored fields. Smart&Green can be used to preprocess soil moisture
    data with outlier removal criteria and techniques of Zscore, MZscore, GESD, and
    Chauvenet to provide a more precise irrigation water need (IWN) in irrigation
    management.
  extract_2: 'Furthermore, we have designed a module to support irrigation management
    with our prediction models, based on GBRT. We evaluated irrigation management
    using the water balance and matric potential approaches with real and predicted

    \ agricultural activities in the world, which has\nbeen increasing over time.\
    \ Choosing an optimal irrigation management plan depends on having\navailable\
    \ data in the monitoring ﬁeld. A smart agriculture system gathers data from several\
    \ sources;\nhowever, the data are not guaranteed to be free of discrepant values\
    \ (i.e., outliers), which can\ndamage the precision of irrigation management.\
    \ Furthermore, data from different sources must ﬁt\ninto the same temporal window\
    \ required for irrigation management and the data preprocessing\nmust be dynamic\
    \ and automatic to beneﬁt users of the irrigation management plan.\nIn this\n\
    paper, we propose the Smart&Green framework to offer services for smart irrigation,\
    \ such as data\nmonitoring, preprocessing, fusion, synchronization, storage, and\
    \ irrigation management enriched\nby the prediction of soil moisture. Outlier\
    \ removal techniques allow for more precise irrigation\nmanagement. For ﬁelds\
    \ without soil moisture sensors, the prediction model estimates the matric\npotential\
    \ using weather, crop, and irrigation information. We apply the predicted matric\
    \ potential\napproach to the Van Genutchen model to determine the moisture used\
    \ in an irrigation management\nscheme. We can save, on average, between 56.4%\
    \ and 90% of the irrigation water needed by applying\nthe Zscore, MZscore and\
    \ Chauvenet outlier removal techniques to the predicted data.\nKeywords: IoT;\
    \ smart agriculture; soil moisture prediction\n1. Introduction\nAgricultural activities\
    \ presently use 70% of the withdrawn freshwater in the world [1]. Therefore,\n\
    it is of fundamental importance that we apply irrigation management, especially\
    \ in semiarid regions\nwith a scarcity of rainfall. Irrigation management is a\
    \ part of precision agriculture, in which the correct\namount of water artiﬁcially\
    \ delivered to a ﬁeld to satisfy the crop needs and the real production of the\n\
    users is analyzed [2].\nThe irrigation must supply the crop water needs at different\
    \ developmental stages in a given\nlocal. Irrigation management is used to detect\
    \ when to irrigate, the amount of water needed, and the\nirrigation frequency,\
    \ based on the monitoring of crop evapotranspiration and soil moisture conditions.\n\
    Crop evapotranspiration measures the water consumption by crops, according to\
    \ the developmental\nSensors 2020, 20, 190; doi:10.3390/s20010190\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\n\
    Sensors 2020, 20, 190\n2 of 25\nstage of the crop and the weather conditions [3].\
    \ The soil moisture impacts the amount of irrigation\nwater given to the crop,\
    \ as irrigation management takes into account the level of water retention in\
    \ the\nsoil. Therefore, precision agriculture can reduce water consumption in\
    \ irrigation by considering the\ngroundwater available to the crop [2].\nThe choice\
    \ of the best irrigation management plan depends on the data available from the\n\
    monitoring ﬁeld. A smart agriculture system gathers and processes data for irrigation\
    \ management\nfrom several sources using computer science and information technology\
    \ [4]. Users can provide\nthe features of different types of crop, soil, and irrigation\
    \ system, as well as the readings of analog\ntensiometers. Tensiometers are soil\
    \ sensors that detect the matric potential, which are used to estimate\nthe moisture\
    \ at different depths and monitoring points in a ﬁeld. Automatic weather stations\
    \ [5] can\nprovide public data through the Internet. Moreover, the ﬁeld may have\
    \ sensors and actuators which\ncan interact with each other as objects of the\
    \ Internet of Things (IoT) in order to provide services\ntransparently to the\
    \ users [6]. Such services are related to irrigation management for monitoring\n\
    (i.e., water, soil, and air) and prediction (weather and soil conditions).\nHowever,\
    \ data are not free of discrepant values (i.e., outliers), which can negatively\
    \ affect the\nprecision of irrigation management. Furthermore, data from different\
    \ sources must ﬁt into the\nsame temporal window required for the irrigation management\
    \ and the data preprocessing must be\ndynamic and automatic for researchers, engineers,\
    \ and owners or farmers to beneﬁt from the irrigation\nmanagement plan. Data fusion\
    \ is required to improve the quality of soil data in the case where several\n\
    sources provide the same type of data (e.g., moisture) from the ﬁeld [7]. Data\
    \ fusion also informs the\ndecision whether to start irrigation or not in irrigation\
    \ management that makes use of other types of\ndata (such as weather or crop data).\n\
    In this paper, we propose the Smart&Green framework to offer services for smart\
    \ irrigation,\nsuch as data monitoring and control, preprocessing, fusion, synchronization,\
    \ storage, and irrigation\nmanagement enriched by the prediction of soil moisture.\
    \ The Smart&Green services are modular\ncomponents which facilitate the reuse\
    \ and customization of code, which are challenges/limitations to\napplying IoT\
    \ in the smart agriculture context [8]. Our framework allows users to set the\
    \ data sources:\nThe nearest weather station, the moisture sensors (analog or\
    \ digital), the type of crop, and the features\nof the irrigation system in the\
    \ monitored ﬁeld. Therefore, Smart&Green also contributes to the solution\nof\
    \ another challenge in applying IoT for the purpose of smart agriculture: The\
    \ integration of the actual\ninfrastructure of the users (i.e., devices, machines,\
    \ and software) [9].\nSmart&Green recommends the best irrigation management plan,\
    \ according to the conﬁguration\nof the monitored ﬁeld. The framework also synchronizes\
    \ weather and soil data, as well as the crop\nstage for the chosen irrigation\
    \ management plan. The Fusion service allows for the deﬁnition of outlier\nremoval\
    \ criteria for the weather and soil data. The fusion service also applies the\
    \ outlier removal\ntechniques Chauvenet, Z-Score, Modiﬁed Z-Score, and Generalized\
    \ ESD before data aggregation,\nin order to obtain general information about the\
    \ soil conditions of a ﬁeld. Our results show that it\nmakes irrigation management\
    \ more precise, therefore saving water.\nFor ﬁelds without soil moisture sensors,\
    \ the prediction module estimates the soil moisture to\nmake the amount of water\
    \ irrigated more precise. In this work, we propose a computational model to\n\
    predict the matric potential based on weather data available at public stations\
    \ [5], crop information,\nand the amount of irrigation water used. As another\
    \ contribution, we provide to the scientiﬁc\ncommunity a public data set containing\
    \ the matric potential and irrigation data for cashew cultivation\nin an experimental\
    \ ﬁeld. The matric potential is the critical variable in measuring the soil moisture.\n\
    The computational model reduces the cost of equipment and energy, as the model\
    \ allows farms\nto estimate the moisture without soil sensors for the same soil\
    \ type. We evaluate the performance\nof a set of popular machine learning techniques\
    \ which have been widely applied to solve regression\nproblems. We measure the\
    \ quality of the models without feature selection using the RMSE (Root Mean\n\
    Squared Error) and the MAE (Mean Absolute Error) as metrics. Our results show\
    \ that the combination\nSensors 2020, 20, 190\n3 of 25\nof predicted data and\
    \ the outlier removal techniques can save an average between 56.4% and 90% of\n\
    irrigation water, estimated by water balance management.\nThe rest of the paper\
    \ is structured as follows: In Section 2, a literary review of IoT platforms for\n\
    Smart Agriculture is presented. Section 3 describes the structure and services\
    \ of the Smart&Green\nframework. Section 4 relates the materials and method of\
    \ the implementation of Smart&Green,\nespecially for the soil moisture prediction\
    \ evaluation. The results are given in Section 5, and we\ndiscuss our contributions\
    \ in Section 6. Appendix A gives details about irrigation management using\nSmart&Green,\
    \ and we formalize the problem of soil moisture prediction in Appendix B.\n2.\
    \ Related Work\nWe carried out a systematic literature review to ﬁnd the works\
    \ which have answered the following\nresearch questions:\n1.\nWhat software exists\
    \ for agricultural management that automates the process of gathering,\npreprocessing,\
    \ fusing, and synchronizing the data used in irrigation management?\n2.\nDoes\
    \ the software implement the well-known irrigation management approaches of matric\n\
    potential (Equation (A2)) and water balance (Equation (A3))?\n3.\nDoes the software\
    \ forecast the soil moisture?\n4.\nCan users conﬁgure the software using information\
    \ about their crops, irrigation system, soil\nsensors, and weather stations close\
    \ to the monitored ﬁeld?\nMost of the discovered papers have partially answered\
    \ the research questions above. To our best\nknowledge, there have been almost\
    \ no Internet of Things (IoT) platforms introduced that provide the\nservices\
    \ required for smart irrigation, such as the gathering, preprocessing, synchronization,\
    \ and fusion\nof data; the planning and execution of irrigation management; or\
    \ soil moisture prediction.\nSeveral studies have only addressed the gathering\
    \ and visualization of weather and soil data\n(Section 2.1). Some works focused\
    \ on data preprocessing by applying outlier detection algorithms\n(Section 2.2).\
    \ Some approaches used speciﬁc methods to decide when to irrigate, whereas others\
    \ have\nimplemented water balance and matric potential (Section 2.3). Soil moisture\
    \ prediction using machine\nlearning techniques applied to crop data, satellite\
    \ images, and irrigation management information\nhas been investigated (Section\
    \ 2.4). In addition, IoT platforms have been studied, which should be\nﬂexible\
    \ enough to allow users to conﬁgure them for different monitoring cases in smart\
    \ agriculture\n(Section 2.5).\n2.1. Data Gathering\nIn general, most of the sensor\
    \ nodes used to monitor soil data (such as temperature, humidity,\nand matric\
    \ potential) and weather data (such as temperature and relative humidity) are\
    \ operated\nusing open, low-cost hardware platforms such as the Arduino [10–14]\
    \ or Raspberry Pi [15–17].\nZigbee [11,17–19], LoRa [16], Wiﬁ [20], Bluetooth\
    \ [14], GSM [12], and GPRS [21] are the predominant\nwireless technologies used.\n\
    Our proposal allows users choose between the CoAP [22] and MQTT [23] protocols\
    \ for sending\ndata to Smart&Green framework storage and later irrigation management.\
    \ For devices that we can not\nturn into a sensor node, such as analog tensiometers,\
    \ our framework has a mobile application with\nwhich users can gather data manually.\
    \ The framework also allows users to choose, as a weather data\nsource, the Brazilian\
    \ automatic weather station nearest to the monitored ﬁeld, from which data can\
    \ be\ngathered via HTTP.\n2.2. Data Preprocessing\nOther approaches have processed\
    \ soil data to detect outliers [24,25] and treat data using noise\nﬁltering techniques\
    \ [26]. One system applied an EKF (Extended Kalman Filter) to the soil moisture\n\
    Sensors 2020, 20, 190\n4 of 25\ndata before the execution of irrigation management,\
    \ in order to avoid the actuators inappropriately\nstarting the irrigation [27].\n\
    The pattern recognition of water consumption by a crop radicular system, presented\
    \ in [28],\nis an outlier detection technique based on a time-series analysis\
    \ of soil moisture gathered at several\ndepths before, during, and after irrigation.\
    \ This technique allows for the identiﬁcation of sensors with\npoor operation,\
    \ which indicates the need for calibration or change.\nOur proposed framework\
    \ allows users to deﬁne criteria for outlier removal for each type of\nweather\
    \ and soil data used in irrigation management. Our framework also gives the option\
    \ to execute\nsuch algorithms as Chauvenet, Z-Score, Modiﬁed Z-Score, and Generalized\
    \ ESD (Extreme Studentized\nDeviation) to remove outliers and fuse soil moisture\
    \ data, in the case when a ﬁeld has several soil\nsensors monitoring at different\
    \ depths.\n2.3. Irrigation Management\nOther works have automatically started\
    \ irrigation by implementing algorithms for analyzing the\ndata gathered by a\
    \ wireless sensor node. In one study, an algorithm based on decision trees used\
    \ the\nsoil temperature and moisture to determine the irrigation time and the\
    \ needed amount of water [29].\nCrisp rules (IF-THEN) were used to compare threshold\
    \ values with the soil moisture gathered by\nsensors, in order to decide whether\
    \ to turn on the sprinklers of an irrigation system, in [30,31].\nDecision support\
    \ platforms for the execution of traditional irrigation management, such as\n\
    the matric potential (Equation (A2)) and water balance (Equation (A3)), have been\
    \ introduced.\nThese systems allow agronomists and farm owners to manage Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT) components\nfor ﬁeld monitoring. The matric potential management\
    \ uses soil data gathered by sensor nodes and\nimages captured by unmanned aerial\
    \ vehicles to correctly estimate the irrigation water need [32].\nWeb systems\
    \ have been used for the planning and execution of irrigation management. Beyond\
    \ the\nvisualization of soil moisture and weather data gathered by wireless sensor\
    \ nodes, these systems\nuse crisp rules for data analysis and, when it is necessary,\
    \ the systems send messages to their users\nin order to notify about irrigation\
    \ times [33] or activate the irrigation system automatically [34,35].\nIn other\
    \ approaches, the system takes the rainfall forecast (available on the Internet)\
    \ into account when\ndeciding whether to activate the irrigation system [36].\
    \ A wireless sensor network can also plan and\nexecute irrigation management [37].\
    \ In this case, the sensor nodes gather and analyze soil moisture\ndata and turn\
    \ the irrigation system on until the moisture achieves the ﬁeld capacity.\nA SCADA\
    \ (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) system can automatically carry out\
    \ the data\ngathering, planning, and execution of the water balance management\
    \ (see Equations (A3) and (A4)).\nThe soil sensor nodes are also actuators, which\
    \ control the irrigation and send data continually to\na management system. The\
    \ system receives data from a weather station on the farm to estimate the\nreference\
    \ evapotranspiration ETo. The system also utilizes the curve of the crop coefﬁcient\
    \ kc, choosing\nits value according to the current developmental stage of the\
    \ crop [38].\nThe water balance and matric potential approaches often must take\
    \ data synchronization into\naccount. Therefore, some applications have synchronized\
    \ the data of previously registered crops,\nas well as soil and weather data,\
    \ to precisely determine the irrigation water need for the current\ndevelopmental\
    \ stage of the crop [39–42].\nThe existing systems described in this section are\
    \ not ﬂexible enough to allow users to set the\nfeatures of a monitored ﬁeld,\
    \ such as the type of crop, the type and number of soil sensors, and irrigation\n\
    system parameters used. The systems usually work with a predeﬁned conﬁguration\
    \ and infrastructure.\nTherefore, code reuse is impracticable for the irrigation\
    \ management of agricultural ﬁelds which do not\nﬁt to the existing system conﬁguration.\
    \ Our proposal allows users to register relevant information for\nirrigation management:\
    \ Different types of crops, soil features, irrigation systems, data sources (weather\n\
    or soil), and outlier removal criteria. In this work, the framework plans the\
    \ irrigation management\nusing the matric potential (Equation (A2)) and water\
    \ balance (Equation (A3)) approaches.\nSensors 2020, 20, 190\n5 of 25\nFurthermore,\
    \ none of the systems could forecast the moisture levels in ﬁelds without soil\
    \ sensors.\nOur proposal implements computational models to predict soil moisture\
    \ based on weather data, crop\ninformation, and irrigation water need (IWN) (see\
    \ Appendix B). In this work, we include the predicted\ndata in the water balance\
    \ management, obtaining between 56.4% and 90% of IWN savings over six\nmonths\
    \ (Section 5.3).\n2.4. Soil Moisture Prediction\nIn [43], the Linear Regression,\
    \ Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting with\nRegression Tree (GBRT)\
    \ machine learning (ML) techniques were applied to weather and soil sensor\ndata\
    \ (moisture and drought stress) to predict the best irrigation plan for a jojoba\
    \ crop. The GBRT\nmodel outperformed the others and, so, the decision support\
    \ service incorporated it as a module of\nthe system. A model based on support\
    \ vector regression (SVR) and k-means ML techniques which\nused weather data and\
    \ forecasts, as well the soil data (temperature and moisture), to forecast the\
    \ soil\nmoisture has also been investigated [44].\nIn [45], an integrated system\
    \ to monitor drought in northern China using satellite images (NOAA,\nMODIS, and\
    \ FY3A), weather stations, and soil data has been discussed. The drought forecasting\n\
    used the matric potential at the depth of the crop root, the water balance model,\
    \ depletion indices,\nand measurements of crop stress to estimate the soil moisture\
    \ and the water quantity needed for\nan extended period.\nIn this work, we apply\
    \ weather data, crop information, and the amount of irrigation water used\nin\
    \ a computational model, in order to estimate the daily matric potential of the\
    \ most superﬁcial soil\nlayer (Appendix B), which signals when the crop needs\
    \ irrigation [2]. We apply the predicted value in\nthe Van Genutchen model (Equation\
    \ (A1)) to obtain the soil moisture used in irrigation management\n(Equations\
    \ (A2) and (A3)) for ﬁelds without soil moisture sensors (i.e., Field 1 of Figure\
    \ A1).\nWe present two different approaches: Local and global prediction models.\
    \ In the local method,\nwe create a prediction model for each monitoring point\
    \ in an experimental ﬁeld (Section 4.2). In the\nglobal approach, we create a\
    \ single model which can be generalized to any monitoring point. We have\nevaluated\
    \ the performance of a set of popular ML techniques which have been widely applied\n\
    to solve regression problems: Linear Regression [46], Decision Stump [47], M5\
    \ Model Trees and\nRules [48,49], Random Tree, Random Forest [50], RepTree, and\
    \ GBRT [51,52]. Our results show that\nGBRT outperforms the other evaluated techniques\
    \ in both approaches.\n2.5. IoT Platforms for Smart Agriculture\nSWAMP (Smart\
    \ Water Management Platform), introduced in [53], is one of the related methods\n\
    which is most similar to our proposal. SWAMP has components to allow for the implementation\
    \ of\ndifferent IoT applications for irrigation management, based on the crop\
    \ and soil moisture approaches.\nUsers can customize the services for the gathering\
    \ (MQTT or LoRa), processing, and synchronization\nof data with different types\
    \ of crops, weather, and country. Therefore, different ﬁeld conﬁgurations\ncan\
    \ reuse these services for data analysis and storage, highlighting the excellent\
    \ ﬂexibility of SWAMP.\nHowever, their techniques for the processing and the fusion\
    \ of data have not been detailed, and no\napplication or service for the prediction\
    \ of soil moisture has been provided.\nThe Agro-IoT framework, introduced in [54],\
    \ is also related to our proposal, which provides\nusers real-time data gathering,\
    \ aggregation (fusion), and analysis in the context of smart farming.\nAgro-IoT\
    \ reuses several components to implement IoT applications, according to the needs\
    \ of the\nmonitored ﬁeld. Agro-IoT provides similar services to our proposed method;\
    \ that is, it also provides\nthe management of devices (i.e., registration of\
    \ sensors and actuators) and event detection through\ndata analysis. However,\
    \ it does not contain modules for data synchronization and outlier removal or\n\
    soil moisture prediction.\nSensors 2020, 20, 190\n6 of 25\n3. Proposal\nIn this\
    \ paper, we propose Smart&Green: An Internet of Things (IoT) framework for the\
    \ smart\nagriculture domain. A framework consists of “a speciﬁc implementation\
    \ of a skeleton of infrastructure used\nfor the conception of a work” [55]. Work\
    \ is any activity performed by users or software. In this proposal,\nthe work\
    \ consists of the planning of irrigation management (Appendix A). In ﬁelds where\
    \ there are\nno soil moisture sensors, a computational model can estimate the\
    \ soil moisture for the same soil type\nusing weather, crop, and irrigation data.\
    \ Agronomists, researchers, and farmers conduct irrigation\nmanagement through\
    \ software which uses Smart&Green. Figure 1 presents the conceptual architecture\n\
    of Smart&Green, divided into four layers: Application, Services, Communication,\
    \ and Physical.\nFigure 1. Conceptual architecture of the Smart&Green IoT Framework\
    \ for Smart Agriculture.\nIn software engineering, a framework can also be “a\
    \ mini architecture that can be reused and that\nprovides behavior and a generic\
    \ structure for a family of software abstractions in a context that speciﬁes the\n\
    collaboration and use of them into a given domain” [56]. Therefore, given the\
    \ smart agriculture domain and\nthe context of smart irrigation, the Smart&Green\
    \ framework speciﬁes the structure of a set of concrete\nand abstract classes\
    \ to implement modules for the gathering, storage, synchronization, and fusion\
    \ of\ndata, as well as mathematical models (Appendix A) which describe irrigation\
    \ management. Irrigation\nmanagement determines the behaviors of the classes and\
    \ modules. As a mini architecture, the proposed\nframework can be reused with\
    \ different smart agriculture software with the generic functionalities of\nirrigation\
    \ management.\n3.1. Application Layer\nThe application layer provides facilities\
    \ for the automatization of irrigation management\n(Appendix A) and soil moisture\
    \ prediction. Through this layer, users of an agriculture management\nsystem can\
    \ insert information about the farm infrastructure: The types of crops and irrigation\
    \ system\nto each monitored ﬁeld, the monitored soil layers, and the weather stations\
    \ closest to the farm.\nSensors 2020, 20, 190\n7 of 25\n3.1.1. Irrigation Management\
    \ Automatization\nThe Matric Potential and Water Balance modules implement well-known\
    \ irrigation management\nmethods (Appendix A). These modules use information registered\
    \ by users as well as that from\nweather and soil data sources. Smart&Green selects\
    \ the best irrigation management based on the data\navailable. The principal functions\
    \ of the Register Module are as follows:\n1.\nUser register: Smart&Green framework\
    \ allows two types of users: Specialist and regular. Specialist\nusers can provide\
    \ agronomic information, such as different types of crops, soil, and irrigation\n\
    system features. They can also register outlier removal criteria for weather and\
    \ soil data and\nchoose algorithms for the fusion service. Regular users can register\
    \ farms and ﬁelds.\n2.\nFarm Register: Users provide information about the farm,\
    \ such as address and geographical\nco-ordinates (i.e., latitude and altitude)\
    \ for the Smart&Green framework, and select the weather\nstation closest to the\
    \ farm.\n3.\nCrop register: A specialist user can create types of crops using\
    \ information such as a description,\nthe curve of the crop coefﬁcient, and the\
    \ critical moisture condition.\n4.\nSystem Irrigation Register: A specialist user\
    \ inserts the type of irrigation systems, such as\n“micro-sprinkler”.\n5.\nWeather\
    \ Station Register: Smart&Green automatically selects the weather station closest\
    \ to the farm\nusing the geographical co-ordinates. Users can conﬁrm this or choose\
    \ another one.\n6.\nSoil Sensor Register: The user can insert the types of soil\
    \ sensors used. Smart&Green already has\nanalog and digital tensiometers.\n7.\n\
    Field Register: Users set the ﬁeld conﬁguration features (Figure A1), such as\
    \ the type of crop,\nirrigation system, soil, and if there are soil monitoring\
    \ points. The developmental stage of the crop\nrepresents the number of days since\
    \ the initial cultivation. Effective precipitation (mm/h) and\nefﬁciency of the\
    \ irrigation system are necessary for irrigation management, in order to compute\n\
    the irrigation time. In the case of monitoring points, users can register the\
    \ type of soil moisture\nsensor (analog or digital) and the depth z monitored\
    \ for each monitoring point in the ﬁeld.\n8.\nField Communication register: In\
    \ the case where the monitored ﬁelds have sensor nodes that\nautomatically gather\
    \ soil data, users can deﬁne the type of communication to send the data to the\n\
    framework. Users set the IP address and speciﬁc conﬁguration (CoAP or MQTT).\n\
    9.\nOutlier Removal Criteria Register: Specialist users can create a threshold\
    \ for minimum and\nmaximum values of each type of weather and soil moisture data\
    \ used in irrigation management.\nThe Smart&Green framework suggests an irrigation\
    \ management plan, according to the data of\na registered ﬁeld. For ﬁelds without\
    \ soil moisture sensors (Field 1 of Figure A1), Smart&Green indicates\nthe water\
    \ balance without soil moisture data (i.e., without the term ∆A in Equation (A3))\
    \ or the water\nbalance with the soil moisture data created by the soil moisture\
    \ prediction module (Section 3.1.2).\nFor ﬁelds with soil moisture sensors (see\
    \ Fields 2 and 3 of Figure A1), the framework calculates the\nmatric potential\
    \ (Equation (A2)) or water balance using the soil moisture data.\n3.1.2. Soil\
    \ Moisture Prediction\nIn this work, we address a large ﬁeld (over 7500 m2) to\
    \ produce one type of crop on a large scale,\nin which the soil is monitored by\
    \ a hundred tensiometers (i.e., soil moisture sensors) at three different\ndepths.\
    \ To investigate this scenario, we present the local and global approaches, which\
    \ can be used to\nlearn a prediction function ˆf (Appendix B).\nThe local approach\
    \ creates a different prediction function ˆfi for each tensiometer at the superﬁcial\n\
    soil layer of the ﬁeld. For this, it uses the observations recorded by a tensiometer\
    \ bi and a weather\nstation ms, as well the water amount wi given to the crop\
    \ and the crop coefﬁcient kc related to the\ncurrent life stage of the crop. The\
    \ local approach deﬁnes the prediction ˆf in terms of n different\nSensors 2020,\
    \ 20, 190\n8 of 25\nfunctions ˆfi for local predictions. However, if a ﬁeld has\
    \ a large number of tensiometers, a large\nnumber of distinctive prediction models\
    \ must be trained.\nThe global approach creates only one prediction function ˆfi\
    \ using the information from all\ntensiometers. Therefore, the global prediction\
    \ model might not ﬁt some individual tensiometers.\nThe Smart&Green framework\
    \ implements the prediction model as a modular service (Figure 2)\nto complement\
    \ the irrigation management of ﬁelds without soil moisture sensors (e.g., ﬁeld\
    \ 1 in\nFigure A1). The framework automatically retrieves and stores the meteorological\
    \ data set Mms\npublished on the Internet by weather stations. We deﬁned Mms in\
    \ Appendix B.\nFigure 2. Smart&Green Module for soil moisture prediction.\nThe\
    \ framework daily preprocesses the Mms data to remove possible outliers. The module\
    \ of soil\nmoisture prediction estimates the matric potential ψp of a ﬁeld, based\
    \ on (M′\nms, W, kc) (Appendix B).\nThe irrigation management module computes\
    \ the current soil moisture θc by applying ψp on the Van\nGenutchen [57] model,\
    \ following Equation (A1). Then, the obtained θc is applied to Equation (A2)\n\
    or (A3) to calculate the irrigation water need (IWN).\nIn the Internet of Things\
    \ (IoT) context, the framework sends the IWN value to an actuator to\nstart the\
    \ irrigation system. The irrigation system stops when the ﬁeld receives the amount\
    \ of water\nspeciﬁed by the IWN. Although this present work does not handle an\
    \ automatic irrigation system,\nthis issue is a concern for the full implementation\
    \ of an IoT system for smart farms.\n3.2. Service Layer\nThe Service layer supports\
    \ the Application layer by storing data provided by Smart&Green users\nand synchronizing\
    \ crop, weather station, and soil data when required by any irrigation management\n\
    module. The Service layer also carries out fusion tasks for data of soil moisture\
    \ sensors (e.g., ﬁelds 2\nand 3 of Figure A1) or the soil moisture prediction.\n\
    The Storage service provides centralized data persistence for the monitoring of\
    \ weather, crop,\nand soil data in the ﬁelds. The Synchronization service selects\
    \ the crop coefﬁcient kc which is\nappropriate to the current development stage\
    \ of the crop and retrieves the weather data Mms for\nthe period needed for irrigation\
    \ management. The service also requests the Communication layer for\nnew data\
    \ from the Internet, if needed.\nIn the case of soil data, the Synchronization\
    \ service selects data from all monitoring points\nBTc in the ﬁeld, taking into\
    \ account the period of irrigation management. If there are no data\navailable,\
    \ the service requests new data from the user (ﬁeld 2 of Figure A1) or the Communication\n\
    Sensors 2020, 20, 190\n9 of 25\nlayer (Field 3 of Figure A1). Finally, the Synchronization\
    \ service makes the data set composed of\n{kc,current, Mms,period, BTc,period}\
    \ available.\nThe Irrigation Management Modules use the Fusion service if there\
    \ is a ﬁeld with monitoring\npoints, each with one or more soil moisture sensors\
    \ (e.g., tensiometers) at different depths z (e.g.,\nﬁelds 2 and 3 of Figure A1).\
    \ The Fusion service can also treat data created in soil moisture prediction\n\
    when irrigation management is required for ﬁelds without soil moisture sensors.\
    \ Data fusion consists\nof processing the data to detect and remove outliers (DRO)\
    \ and submitting data to a co-operative\nfunction (CF), according to a multilevel\
    \ data fusion architecture [58].\nDRO tasks apply criteria and algorithms deﬁned\
    \ by specialist users to immediately detect and\nremove outliers. The Register\
    \ module of the Application layer allows for the creation of threshold\nvalues\
    \ for soil data. DRO algorithms are speciﬁc to the soil layer monitored. According\
    \ to [58],\nthe Z-score is more efﬁcient for data series at the most superﬁcial\
    \ soil layer (e.g., z = 15 cm). In contrast,\nthe Generalized ESD (Extreme Studentized\
    \ Deviate) algorithm works well with data at depth of\nz = 45 cm. The Smart&Green\
    \ framework has implementations of the Chauvenet, Z-Score, Modiﬁed\nZ-Score, and\
    \ Generalized ESD algorithms.\nA co-operative function (CF) [59] aggregates one\
    \ type of data gathered at different monitoring\npoints of a ﬁeld. Smart&Green\
    \ uses the mean function as the CF to aggregate soil moisture data at the\nsame\
    \ depth. For example, Field 2 of Figure A1 has six monitoring points at two depths.\
    \ Therefore,\nthe framework calculates the mean of each set of six samples gathered\
    \ at a given depth z. After fusion,\nthe data are ready for irrigation management\
    \ at the Application layer, which decides whether irrigation\nshould be started.\n\
    3.3. Communication Layer\nThe Communication Layer has a set of software to gather\
    \ weather and soil data through network\nprotocols. This includes a weather client,\
    \ four soil clients, three soil servers, and a gateway (see\nFigure 3). The weather\
    \ client consists of an HTTP client which downloads weather station data from\n\
    the Internet and stores them. Smart&Green offers an API to gather data from Brazilian\
    \ automatic\nweather stations [5].\nFigure 3. Interaction between the Communication\
    \ Layer and the Physical and Services Layers.\nSensors 2020, 20, 190\n10 of 25\n\
    The soil client gathers the matric potential data ψm if the ﬁeld has tensiometers\
    \ installed. If the\ntensiometers are analog, users have to manually collect the\
    \ ψm data, using a mobile application that\nsends it to the framework via HTTP.\
    \ If the tensiometers are digital, they are integrated into sensor\nnodes that\
    \ send the data to a gateway near the ﬁeld. The gateway hosts CoAP and MQTT clients,\n\
    which forward the ψm data to the servers of the framework.\n4. Materials and Method\n\
    In this section, we list the principal software components used in the implementation\
    \ of our\nproposed framework (Section 4.1). We describe what we use for soil moisture\
    \ prediction, in terms of\n(1) the weather, crop, and soil moisture information;\
    \ (2) the criteria for outlier detection and removal;\nand (3) the tested machine\
    \ learning techniques (see Section 4.2).\n4.1. Smart & Green Framework Implementation\n\
    We implemented the Smart&Green framework using the Python 3 Language. In the Application\n\
    layer (Section 3.1), irrigation management by the water balance module uses PyETo\
    \ [60] to calculate the\nreference evapotranspiration for a crop, with reference\
    \ to the Penman-Monteith Model [61]. The crop\nevapotranspiration measures the\
    \ water consumption by crops, according to the developmental stage\nof the crop\
    \ and weather conditions [3]. The Service Layer uses the MySQL database [62] to\
    \ support the\nStorage service. The PyAstronomy library [63] provides the implementation\
    \ of the Generalized ESD\n(Extreme Studentized Deviate) algorithm for the Fusion\
    \ Service.\nThe aiocoap package [64] supports the implementation of the CoAP client\
    \ and server of the\nCommunication layer (Section 3.3). The MQTT client uses the\
    \ Eclipse Paho MQTT client library [65],\nand we used Mosquito as the MQTT server\
    \ [66]. Our API for the acquisition of weather data operates\nby scraping the\
    \ web page of the automatic Brazilian weather stations [5] using the libraries\
    \ requests [67]\nand beautifulsoup4 [68], as well the frameworks Django [69] and\
    \ Django rest [70]. We implemented\nthe mobile application for soil moisture gathering\
    \ from ﬁelds with analog tensiometers (e.g., ﬁeld 2 of\nFigure A1) in the Javascript\
    \ language through the Firebase platform [71], React Native framework [72],\n\
    Realm [73], and React Native Firebase [74] libraries.\nWe also provide a web interface\
    \ for the\nSmart&Green Framework developed using Django [69]. Smart&Green was\
    \ run on a machine with\n2 GB of RAM, 20 GB of hard disk storage, and the Ubuntu\
    \ 18.04LTS OS.\nFor farm ﬁelds with sensor nodes, such as ﬁeld 3 of Figure A1,\
    \ we used an Arduino Pro Mini and\nthree Irrometer Watermark 200SS [75] digital\
    \ tensiometers to implement a sensor node which gathers\nsoil moisture data at\
    \ 15, 45, and 75 cm. The watermark measures the soil water tension (i.e., matric\n\
    potential), which ranges from 0 to 200 CBar/KPa. The sensor nodes use four AA\
    \ alkaline batteries of\n1.5 v as the power source. We modify the Arduino removing\
    \ the voltage controller and LEDs to the\nnode has a longer operating life. Sensor\
    \ nodes send soil data through an nRF24L01 with an external\nanthem and power\
    \ ampliﬁer. The nRF24L01 is a single-chip radio transceiver for the 2.4–2.5 GHz\
    \ ISM\nband. After data transmission, the sensor node hibernates for an hour to\
    \ save power [58]. We used\na Raspberry Pi 3 with the Raspbian OS as the gateway\
    \ to receive soil moisture data and send them by\nthe CoAP or MQTT client to storage.\n\
    4.2. Soil Moisture Prediction\n4.2.1. Raw Data Set\nWe obtained a data set of\
    \ soil moisture from an experimental cashew ﬁeld with other tropical\nraw materials\
    \ in the city of Paraibapa, Brazil [76]. The ﬁeld had approximately 250 cashew\
    \ trees with\nnine monitoring spots. Each spot had three tensiometers that allowed\
    \ manual reading of the matric\npotential at depths of 15, 45, and 75 cm. Figure\
    \ 4 shows the details of the analog tensiometers (soil\nmoisture sensors), which\
    \ provided the data set from 2016, 2017, and 2018, with 234, 245, and 138 daily\n\
    samples, respectively. It is worth mentioning that, in 2016, the ﬁeld had salvation\
    \ irrigation in which\nSensors 2020, 20, 190\n11 of 25\nwe gave 5 liters of water\
    \ for each bud whenever the installed tensiometer at a depth of 15 cm read\na\
    \ matric potential of 60 kPa. Salvation irrigation prevents plants from dying.\n\
    (a) Tensiometers at 15, 45, and 75 cm depths near a\ncashew bud.\n(b) Cashew buds.\n\
    Figure 4. Details of the Experimental Field.\nThe meteorological data set was\
    \ obtained from a Brazilian national weather station at Itapipoca\ncity, Ceara\
    \ (altitude 102 m; latitude 03◦29′ S; longitude 39◦35′ W). However, we decide\
    \ to use the\npluviometer sensor data of the ﬁeld, as the rainfall sensor of the\
    \ weather station had missing values\nover an extended period. Table 1 presents\
    \ the acronyms, the description of the variables, and the\nmeasurement data units\
    \ used in our prediction problem. We release the aggregated data set to the\n\
    scientiﬁc community to ensure the reproducibility of our results and promote research\
    \ developments\nin this ﬁeld (see Supplementary Materials).\nTable 1. Raw dataset\

    We also analyzed the soil particle composition of the experimental ﬁeld. The soil\
    \ has a medium\nsandy texture in the layer from 0 to 30 cm (805 g kg−1 of sand,\
    \ 76 g kg−1 of clay and 119 g kg−1 of silt)\nand the medium texture in the other\
    \ layers, presenting the characteristics of a red-yellow Argisol [77].\nThe maximum\
    \ organic matter content was 6.4 g dm−3; the pH varied from 5.6 to 6.3 between\
    \ the\nlayers; the capacity of cations exchange, from 31.3 to 64.8, and the sum\
    \ of maximum bases was 62% in\nthe most superﬁcial layer.\n4.2.2. Outlier Detection\
    \ and Removal\nFirst, the instances that presented Tmax, Tmin < 20, Tmax, Tmin\
    \ > 39, RHmax, RHmin < 20, and Ri >\n250 were removed, as these feature ranges\
    \ are uncommon in the city of Paraibapa. After that, the mean\nµ and the standard\
    \ deviation σ were computed for the variables P, Rn, and U2 for each month.\n\
    Afterward, we ﬁltered out data instances with anomalies; that is, the instances\
    \ with distance to µ\ngreater or equal than 3 × σ were removed, as performed in\
    \ [78].\n4.2.3. Machine Learning Methods\nWe decided to build the prediction model\
    \ using algorithms which have been widely applied to\nsolve regression problems:\
    \ Linear Regression [46], Decision Stump [47], M5 Model Trees and Rules\n(M5P)\
    \ [48,49], Random Tree, Random Forest [50], and RepTree. Weka [79] provided all\
    \ of these.\nAnother widely used algorithm is the Gradient Boosting Regression\
    \ Tree (GBRT) [51,52] method and\nits implementation XGBoost [80].\nLinear regression\
    \ is a linear model of the relationship between a scalar response (in this work,\n\
    the matric potential ψm) and one or more explanatory variables (see Table 1).\
    \ The linear model consists\nof linear predictor functions which use the data\
    \ to estimate the unknown parameters [46]. Decision\nstump models a one-level\
    \ decision tree. The tree has one root (an internal node) which connects the\n\
    leaves (terminal nodes). The model uses the value of one single feature to make\
    \ predictions [47].\nM5P produces a tree with a multilinear regression model for\
    \ each node. A greedy algorithm\nremoves the insigniﬁcant features in the model\
    \ ﬁtted to each node. Then, the terminal node computes\nnew predicted values,\
    \ considering the predicted values of other intermediate nodes between the\nterminal\
    \ node and the root node [48,49].\nRandom Tree (RT) uses if-then conditions for\
    \ answering questions in a sequential order to achieve\na speciﬁc result. The\
    \ depth of the tree consists of the number of questions needed to reach a prediction\n\
    value. Random Forest (RF) is a collection of decision trees that can use a random\
    \ subset of the features.\nTherefore, the number of trees impacts the number of\
    \ features used and limits the number of errors\ndue to bias or variance [50].\n\
    RepTree is a fast decision tree algorithm in Weka which uses information gain/variance\
    \ to build\na regression tree. Reduced-error pruning takes into account the method\
    \ backﬁtting [79]. GBRT is a\npredictive model based on a weak learner, a loss\
    \ function, and an additive model. The weak learner is\na decision tree that can\
    \ be modiﬁed to achieve better results. The additive model adds weak learners\n\
    to correct for the residual errors of all previous trees. The loss function consists\
    \ of the mean squared\nerror for regression problems [51,52].\nWe set some hyperparameters\
    \ required by RT, RF, RepTree, and GBRT with the default values\nof Weka [79]\
    \ and XGboost [80]. We set the maximum tree depth (max_depth) to 3 for GBRT and\
    \ to\nwithout restriction for the RT, RF, and RepTree methods. The number of trees\
    \ (n_estimators) was\n100 for all methods. Finally, GBRT required a third hyperparameter,\
    \ the learning rate (learning_rate),\nwhich we set to 0.1.\nSensors 2020, 20,\
    \ 190\n13 of 25\nThe training and test sets included, respectively, 80% and 20%\
    \ of the data from each soil moisture\nsensor at a depth of 15 cm. Overall, for\
    \ each possible combination, we generated a model and\npicked the model which\
    \ gave the lowest MAE (Mean Absolute Error) and RMSE (Root Mean Square\nError)—metrics\
    \ which have been widely used to measure the quality of a prediction model (see\n\
    Equations (A6) and (A7) in Appendix B).\n5. Results\nFirst, we employed the outlier\
    \ removal techniques of Fusion Service (Section 3.2) on the real\nsoil moisture\
    \ data in order to analyze the inﬂuence of these techniques on irrigation management\n\
    (Section 3.1.1) in the Smart&Green framework (Section 5.1). Then, we analyzed\
    \ the MAE and RMSE of\nthe machine learning techniques tested with the local and\
    \ global approaches (Section 3.1.2) proposed\nfor the Smart&Green soil moisture\
    \ prediction module (Section 5.2). Finally, we applied the soil moisture\ndata\
    \ created by the best prediction models for irrigation management to analyze the\
    \ water savings\n(Section 5.3).\n5.1. Impact of Outlier Removal Techniques on\
    \ Real Moisture Data by Irrigation Management\nFrom the raw data set (Section\
    \ 4.2), we selected data from from April to October/2017, since\nthere was no\
    \ salvation irrigation in the experimental ﬁeld, which could affect the irrigation\
    \ water need\n(IWN) estimated by water balance and matric potential management.\
    \ Then, we set Fusion Service\n(Section 3.2) to use an outlier removal technique\
    \ to process the matric potential ψc provided by the nine\ntensiometers (soil\
    \ moisture sensors) at 15 cm of depth in the experimental ﬁeld (Section 4.2).\
    \ Second,\nthe Fusion Service aggregated ψc data using the co-operative function\
    \ mean. After this, the modules\nof water balance and potential matric (Section\
    \ 3.1) applied the aggregated ψc to Van Genutchen\nModel (Equation (A1)) to estimate\
    \ the current soil moisture θc at the crop root zone (z = 30 cm) and\ncompute\
    \ IWN.\nWater balance management (Equation (A3)) can depend only on the crop evapotranspiration\
    \ ETc\n(Equation (A4)) and rainfall R to estimate the IWN of a crop. Therefore,\
    \ we can only use weather data\nand the crop coefﬁcient (Table 1) to plan water\
    \ balance for n days. However, the IWN estimation is\nmore precise when we can\
    \ incorporate the current soil moisture data θcz since the water storage in\n\
    the crop root zone can contribute to the crop water supply. We set water balance\
    \ to estimates IWN\nevery three days (n = 3) over six months (26 samples of n\
    \ intervals), and the results in Table 3 indicate\nthat the use of θcz saved an\
    \ average of 90.4% of the IWN estimated, as compared to that using only\nweather\
    \ and crop data.\nTable 3.\nPercentage of water saved over six months by irrigation\

    \ crop development, since these outlier removal techniques decreased\nthis result\
    \ to 89.3%. Zscore and MZscore data treatment led to an increment of the moisture\
    \ θc values\n(Figure 5a), and, consequently, a reduction of the term ∆A of water\
    \ balance (Equation (A3)). GESD and\nChauvenet did not affect the moisture θc\
    \ data enough (Figure 5b), as well as IWN saving (Table 3).\nSensors 2020, 20,\

    \ Moisture Data used in Water Balance—the points outside of the dashed lines are\
    \ the\ncurrent moisture data θcz modiﬁed by an outlier removal technique.\nThe\
    \ matric potential approach depends exclusively on the soil moisture data (Equation\
    \ (A2)),\nand we planned this irrigation management to estimate the daily IWN\
    \ over six months (121 samples of\ndays) using the current moisture θc data at\
    \ the shallowest crop root zone (e.g., z = 30 cm). In the matric\npotential approach,\
    \ irrigation occurs only when θc is minor or equal to the critical moisture condition\n\
    θcr, which is the ideal moisture for irrigation and signals when the crop productivity\
    \ is starting to\ndecline. Table 3 presents the IWN saving of matric potential\
    \ management that used an outlier removal\ntechnique when compared to the one\
    \ that did not use them. Figure 6 shows that there were several\ndays where θc\
    \ was equal to θcr (day 1 to 13). However, all outlier remotion techniques treated\
    \ various\noutliers that reduced the current moisture (e.g., 14th and 15th; 18th\
    \ and 19th; 26th days), improving\nthe water savings, on average, by 4.3% to 20.7%\
    \ (Table 3). Zscore and MZscore (Figure 6a) contributed\nmore to the tradeoff\
    \ between IWN saving and healthy crop development because they increased the\n\
    current moisture θc above the critical condition θcr in more days(e.g., the 40th\
    \ to 43th; 64th; 104th days)\nthan GESD and Chauvenet (Figure 6b).\n(a) Zscore\

    \ Models for Soil Moisture Prediction\nThe main goal of this analysis is to evaluate\
    \ and establish the best machine learning (ML)\ntechnique among those tested for\
    \ each approach (local and global prediction models). In this context,\nwe considered\
    \ analog soil sensors (tensiometers) distributed throughout a large ﬁeld (Figure\
    \ 4).\nWe compared the following ML techniques: Linear Regression, Decision Stump,\
    \ M5P, Random Tree,\nRandom Forest, RepTree, and Gradient Boosting. Through the\
    \ metrics MAE (Mean Absolute Error)\nand RMSE (Root Mean Square Error), we evaluated\
    \ the local and global approaches for the estimation\nof the matric potential\
    \ ψm—the primary variable for soil moisture prediction (Appendix B). Finally,\n\
    we used the 99% conﬁdence intervals to determine the best-performing model.\n\
    Table 4 presents the MAE and RMSE retrieved by the local approach for each prediction\
    \ algorithm.\nThe results of the local approach are the mean of the MAE and RMSE\
    \ achieved by the nine models\nbuilt for each monitoring point of the experimental\
    \ ﬁeld. Considering all the analyzed errors, Gradient\nBoosting outperformed all\
    \ the other techniques, followed by Random Forest. Both approaches\npresented\
    \ acceptable errors, according to a specialist agronomic engineer.\nTable 4. Evaluation\

    (b) Global Approach\nFigure 7. Analysis of the relevance of features by gradient\
    \ boosting prediction approach.\n5.3. Analysis of Water Savings through the Use\
    \ of Predicted Data of Soil Moisture\nWe used the local and global models based\
    \ on Gradient Boosting to predict the matric potential\nψm for a ﬁeld without\
    \ soil moisture sensors over six months. The local approach estimated daily ψp\n\
    at a depth of 15 cm, as the ﬁeld had nine monitoring points. Therefore, we could\
    \ apply the outlier\nremoval techniques to treat this data set of nine daily values.\
    \ The global approach estimated one daily\nvalue for the ψp at a depth of 15 cm\
    \ in the ﬁeld. In this case, there was no need for preprocessing the\ndata using\
    \ the outlier removal techniques. We use ψp to compute predicted soil moisture\
    \ data for the\ncrop root zone (z = 30 cm) through the Van Genutchen Model (Equation\
    \ (A1)).\nFor water balance (Equation (A3)), executed every three days (n = 3)\
    \ for six months (26 samples\nof n), we compared the beneﬁts of our computational\
    \ models by analyzing how much they saved,\nin terms of the irrigation water need\
    \ (IWN) estimated using only weather and crop data. Table 6 shows\nthat the use\
    \ of global approach data saved an average of 56.4% and that the local approach\
    \ without\ndata preprocessing saved 100% of the IWN on average.\nThe Zscore and\
    \ MZscore methods tended to treat outliers by removing values that decreased the\n\
    current moisture θc (Figure 8a). Therefore, they reduced the result of the local\
    \ predicted data by 90%\nand 75.6%, respectively, for water balance. The employment\
    \ of Chauvenet for the local approach data\nalso saved 90% of IWN on average since\
    \ it almost achieved the performance of Zscore (Figure 8b).\nThe use of GESD did\
    \ not affect the local approach predicted data (Figure 8b), such that it had almost\n\
    the same water savings as when no outlier removal technique was employed (Table\
    \ 6). We consider\nthe global approach and local approach using Zscore, MZscore\
    \ and Chauvenet techniques optimized\nthe tradeoff between IWN saving and healthy\
    \ crop development, and they did not outweigh the IWN\nsavings of water balance\
    \ that used real soil moisture θc (Table 3).\nTable 6. Percentage of water saved\

    Smart Agriculture presently lacks an Internet of Things (IoT) platform for the\
    \ gathering,\npreprocessing, and storage of data used in irrigation management,\
    \ which also allows for the reuse of\ncode to different sets of crops, soil, irrigation\
    \ system, and weather data sources. In this paper, we have\nproposed the Smart&Green\
    \ IoT framework which executes an irrigation management plan using the\nwater\
    \ balance and potential matric approaches according to the crop, as well as irrigation\
    \ system\ninformation provided by users and the weather and soil moisture data\
    \ available close to the monitored\nﬁelds. Smart&Green can be used to preprocess\
    \ soil moisture data with outlier removal criteria and\ntechniques of Zscore,\
    \ MZscore, GESD, and Chauvenet to provide a more precise irrigation water need\n\
    (IWN) in irrigation management.\nFor large ﬁelds without soil moisture sensors,\
    \ we have considered the problem of predicting the\nsoil moisture by analyzing\
    \ the weather data, crop coefﬁcients, and amount of irrigation water. We have\n\
    formally introduced the problem of soil prediction and designed a methodology\
    \ which uses training\nmodels according to two different approaches: Local and\
    \ global. These approaches determine the\nimplementation of prediction models\
    \ based on supervised machine learning techniques.\nThe local approach trains\
    \ a model for each soil sensor in the ﬁeld, achieving high performance.\nHowever,\
    \ this approach can lead to a high cost of data management if there are a large\
    \ number of\nsensors, as it requires the training and maintainence of a large\
    \ number of distinctive prediction models.\nOn the other hand, the global approach\
    \ trains a single prediction model over the observations of all\nthe sensors.\
    \ Our results show that gradient boosting with regression trees (GBRT) outperformed\
    \ the\nother evaluated techniques in both approaches. The local approach had the\
    \ best results with gradient\nboost, although the results using the global prediction\
    \ model were also acceptable.\nFurthermore, we have designed a module to support\
    \ irrigation management with our prediction\nmodels, based on GBRT. We evaluated\
    \ irrigation management using the water balance and matric\npotential approaches\
    \ with real and predicted data of soil moisture, as well as the impact of preprocessing\n\
    data with outlier removal techniques. The real data was part of a data set collected\
    \ from an experimental\nfield for research in the city of Paraipaba, Brazil, in\
    \ which cashews and other raw materials were grown.\nWe also report that the dataset\
    \ will be made publicly available to ensure the reproducibility of our results\n\
    and promote research developments in this field (see Supplementary Materials).\n\
    The use of real soil moisture data from the data set in the water balance approach\
    \ saved as\nmuch as 90.4% of the IWN obtained for the water balance when using\
    \ only weather and crop data.\nZscore and MZscore applied to the real moisture\
    \ data saved 89.3% of IWN, optimizing the tradeoff\nbetween IWN saving and healthy\
    \ crop development. For the matric potential approach, Zscore and\nMZscore obtained\
    \ (on average) 20.7% and 14.1% of the IWN savings obtained by matric potential\n\
    without the use of any outlier removal technique. Considerating a ﬁeld without\
    \ soil moisture sensors,\nwe obtained a reduction between 56.4% and 90% of the\
    \ water balance IWN based on only weather\nand crop data, when we use our global\
    \ and local approaches to predict the soil moisture data. Zscore,\nMZscore, and\
    \ Chauvenet preprocess the predicted data to optimize the tradeoff without outweighing\n\
    the performance of water balance using real moisture data. We do not recommend\
    \ the use of predicted\ndata in the matric potential approach, as the computational\
    \ models (with errors) outperform mostly\nthe same approach using real data in\
    \ terms of water savings, according to our results.\nSupplementary Materials:\

    \ some examples of conﬁgurations composed of a crop, soil, weather,\nand an irrigation\
    \ system. The house is next to the entrance of the farm and has a connection to\n\
    the Internet. The house also hosts devices that connect sensor nodes in the ﬁeld\
    \ to the Internet.\nAutomatic weather stations make weather data available on\
    \ the Internet.\nIn this work, we address ﬁelds with one type of crop whose soil\
    \ has analog (Field 2) or digital\ntensiometers (Field 3) monitoring the moisture\
    \ at more than one depth z. Tensiometers installed\nat different points b of the\
    \ ﬁeld gather readings of the matric potential ψm. Mathematical models\nuse ψm\
    \ to measure the soil moisture θ as the level of water retention in the type of\
    \ soil. We use the\nVan Genuchten Model [57] to express θ as the volume of water\
    \ by the volume of soil (cm3/cm3),\nas Equation (A1) shows:\nθ(ψm) = θr +\nθs\
    \ − θr\n[1 + (α × |ψm|)n]1− 1\nn\n,\n(A1)\nwhere θr is the residual water content,\
    \ θs is the saturated water content, α is related to the inverse of\nthe air entry\
    \ suction, and n is a measure of the pore-size distribution in the soil (e.g.,\
    \ Table 2 has these\nVan Genutchen constants for the experimental ﬁeld soil).\n\
    The management of matric potential estimates the irrigation water need (IWN) for\
    \ a ﬁeld with\nsoil sensors (e.g., Field 3 of Figure A1) taking into account the\
    \ soil moisture at the monitored depths zi,\nas Equation (A2) shows:\nIWN = (θ\
    \ f c,z1 − θcr,z1) × z1 + (θ f c,z2 − θc,z2) × z2 + (θ f c,z3 − θc,z3) × z3\n\
    E f\n,\n(A2)\nwhere:\n•\nzi represent the thickness of soil along the proﬁle (monitored\
    \ depth);\n•\nθ f c represents the ﬁeld capacity at a depth z after the drainage\
    \ of water excess, which is a constant\nobtained by a laboratory soil analysis;\n\
    •\nθcr is the ideal moisture for irrigation, signaling when the crop productivity\
    \ starts to decline;\n•\nθc is the current soil moisture. In matric potential\
    \ management, we initialize the irrigation by\nθc,z1 ≤ θcr; and\n•\nE f is the\
    \ efﬁciency of the irrigation system used in the ﬁeld.\nWater balance management\
    \ computes the IWN for an interval of n days, comparing the inputs and\noutputs\
    \ of water in the soil by using the daily crop evapotranspiration ETc, the rainfall\
    \ R, and ∆A =\n(θ f c − θc)z which represents the soil moisture at the crop root\
    \ zone z through Equation (A3).\nIWN = ∑n\ni=1(ETc,i − Ri) − ∆A\nE f\n.\n(A3)\n\
    The value Ef is the efficiency of the irrigation system placed in the field. The\
    \ crop evapotranspiration\nETc represents the water consumption by a type of crop\
    \ at its current life development stage, which is\ngiven by:\nETc = ETo × kc.\n\
    (A4)\nThe Penman-Monteith model [61] estimates the reference evapotranspiration\
    \ ETo using weather\ndata. Each type of crop, without hydrological restriction,\
    \ has a speciﬁc coefﬁcient curve in which the\ncrop coefﬁcient kc varies from\
    \ 0 to 1.5 with the number days since the planting of the crop.\nSensors 2020,\

    \ Problem of Soil Moisture Prediction\nLet B = {b1, . . . , bn} be the set of\
    \ tensiometers monitoring the soil moisture of a ﬁeld at n different\npoints.\
    \ A tensiometer bj gathers the sample (ψj,15, ψj,45, ψj,75), which consists of\
    \ the matric potential\nψ readings at 15, 45, and 75 cm depths, respectively,\
    \ at a point j. Let W = {w1, . . . , wn} be the set of\nwater amount given to\
    \ the crop at n different points by an irrigation system. Irrigation management\n\
    calculates W using the Equations (A2) and (A3), for example.\nThe weather data\
    \ are required, as the climatic conditions affect a crop’s need for soil water\
    \ and\nrainfall can increase the soil moisture. Therefore, we assume that there\
    \ is a weather station ms close to the\nfield which provides the meteorological\
    \ data set Mms = {Tmin, Tmax, RHmin, RHmax, Rn,U2, P, Ri}, where:\n•\nTmin and\
    \ Tmax are the minimum and maximum air temperature, respectively;\n•\nRHmin and\
    \ RHmax are the minimum and maximum relative humidity, respectively;\n•\nRn is\
    \ the net radiation;\n•\nU2 is the wind speed;\n•\nP is the atmospheric pressure;\
    \ and\n•\nRi is the rainfall.\nWithin a daily time interval, there are several\
    \ observations about the weather and ﬁeld. We denote\nby O the collection of observations,\
    \ which consists of (t, B, Mms, W, kc), recorded within a time t over\na day.\
    \ The irrigation scheduling methods presented in Appendix A decide to start precise\
    \ irrigation\nwhen the current moisture θc,z1 is low at the superﬁcial layer of\
    \ soil (z1 = 15 cm). Therefore, the matric\npotential ψi,15 is analyzed daily\
    \ to achieve θc,z1 using the Van Genutchen model (Equation (A1)). In this\nwork,\
    \ we wish to monitor the level of soil moisture without soil sensors (i.e., tensiometers).\n\
    Let y(i, Mms, wi, kc) be a function that, given the monitoring point i, the meteorological\
    \ variables\nMms, the irrigation water amount wi at the point i, and the crop\
    \ coefﬁcient kc returns ψi,15 (the matric\npotential at a depth of 15 cm). Then,\
    \ y(i, Mms, wi, kc) = ψi,15. We deﬁne the problem of soil moisture\nprediction\
    \ as the problem of ﬁnding an accurate function f for predicting y(i, Mms, wi,\
    \ kc), given all\nthe observations recorded in O.\nSensors 2020, 20, 190\n21 of\

    \ predictive function ˆf over the class\nof all possible predictive functions\
    \ H, such that\nˆf = argmin∆( f ),\n(A5)\nwhere f ∈ H and ∆ is a loss function\
    \ assessing the quality of a candidate predictive function f over the\nobservations\
    \ in O. In this work, we use the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and the Mean Absolute\
    \ Error\n(MAE) loss functions, deﬁned as:\n∆RMSE( f ) =\nv\nu\nu\nt 1\n|O′|\n\
    ∑\n(i,Mms,wi,kc)∈O′\n( f (i, Mms, wi, kc) − y(i, Mms, wi, kc))2, and\n(A6)\n∆MAE(\

    (A7)\nwhere O’ is the set of observations used to assess the quality of the prediction\
    \ and f (i, Mms, wi, kc) is the estimate\nreturned by function f for y(i, Mms,\
    \ wi, kc). The smaller the value yielded by the above loss functions, the better\n\
    the predictive performance of f.\nWe employ Machine Learning (ML) techniques to\
    \ address the problem of soil moisture prediction.\nMore speciﬁcally, we aim at\
    \ learning, from the observations in O, some function ˆf that minimizes the\n\

  limitations: 'Some limitations of the proposed framework:

    -The proposed framework may not be suitable for large-scale irrigation systems
    where the number of sensors and data volume is very large.

    - The framework assumes that the data collected from the sensors is accurate and
    reliable.

    - The framework may not be able to handle real-time data effectively, which may
    lead to delays in irrigation decisions.'
  main_objective: The main objective of the study is to develop a framework for automated
    irrigation management that integrates IoT and machine learning technologies. The
    framework is designed to collect, preprocess, and store data from various sources,
    and to use this data to make informed decisions about irrigation scheduling.

  explanation: 'The paper focuses on the monitoring and management systems for irrigation
    management with the key goal of optimizing water resources and crop yield. This
    response will provide you with the two most relevant verbatim quotes from the
    paper, both of which deal specifically with areas related to your focus point.


    **Assistant**


    **Focus:** Soil moisture sensors and weather stations for real-time, localized
    data collection


    **Quote 1:** “A precision irrigation system is designed to apply water at a differential
    rate in response to the temporal and spatial variation in crop water need across
    a field. This process is supported by a number of sensors providing data to a
    real-time decision support system. These sensors include weather stations, soil
    moisture sensors, environmental sensors, plant sensors and thermal sensors which
    may be integrated into a wireless sensor network.”


    **Quote 2:** “A combination of multiple sensor inputs deployed at a density that
    captures spatial variability is therefore likely to yield the most robust and
    accurate solution for precision irrigation.”'

    \ is the largest consumptive user of fresh water. Water scarcity\nis increasing\
    \ worldwide, resulting in tighter regulation of its use for agriculture. This\
    \ necessitates the\ndevelopment of irrigation practices that are more efﬁcient\
    \ in the use of water but do not compromise\ncrop quality and yield. Precision\
    \ irrigation already achieves this goal, in part. The goal of precision\nirrigation\
    \ is to accurately supply the crop water need in a timely manner and as spatially\
    \ uniformly\nas possible. However, to maximize the beneﬁts of precision irrigation,\
    \ additional technologies need\nto be enabled and incorporated into agriculture.\
    \ This paper discusses how incorporating adaptive\ndecision support systems into\
    \ precision irrigation management will enable signiﬁcant advances in\nincreasing\
    \ the efﬁciency of current irrigation approaches. From the literature review,\
    \ it is found that\nprecision irrigation can be applied in achieving the environmental\
    \ goals related to sustainability.\nThe demonstrated economic beneﬁts of precision\
    \ irrigation in ﬁeld-scale crop production is however\nminimal. It is argued that\
    \ a proper combination of soil, plant and weather sensors providing\nreal-time\
    \ data to an adaptive decision support system provides an innovative platform\
    \ for improving\nsustainability in irrigated agriculture. The review also shows\
    \ that adaptive decision support systems\nbased on model predictive control are\
    \ able to adequately account for the time-varying nature of the\nsoil–plant–atmosphere\
    \ system while considering operational limitations and agronomic objectives\n\
    in arriving at optimal irrigation decisions. It is concluded that signiﬁcant improvements\
    \ in crop\nyield and water savings can be achieved by incorporating model predictive\
    \ control into precision\nirrigation decision support tools. Further improvements\
    \ in water savings can also be realized by\nincluding deﬁcit irrigation as part\
    \ of the overall irrigation management strategy. Nevertheless, future\nresearch\
    \ is needed for identifying crop response to regulated water deﬁcits, developing\
    \ improved\nsoil moisture and plant sensors, and developing self-learning crop\
    \ simulation frameworks that can\nbe applied to evaluate adaptive decision support\
    \ strategies related to irrigation.\nKeywords: precision irrigation; adaptive\

    \ of crops, making irrigation the largest\nconsumptive user of fresh water [1].\
    \ Over 80% of freshwater withdrawals in developing countries is\napplied in irrigation\
    \ [2]. Irrigated agriculture provides 40% of the world’s food from less than 20%\
    \ of\nthe cultivated area highlighting the importance of irrigation in global\
    \ food security [3].\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353; doi:10.3390/su9030353\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability\n\
    Sustainability 2017, 9, 353\n2 of 29\nIrrigated crop production globally extends\
    \ over 275 million hectares, with an estimated annual\nincrease of 1.3% [2]. Global\
    \ climate change may further increase irrigation water demand due to a\ngreater\
    \ variation in annual precipitation amounts [4]. Postel [5] suggested that irrigation\
    \ will provide\n46% of the global crop water requirement by 2025, which was computed\
    \ as 28% in 1995, resulting in a\ndecline of rain-fed agriculture. Food production\
    \ in the developing world, notably in South, Southeast\nand East Asia, is at present\
    \ heavily reliant on irrigation. The total irrigated area in Asia is 230 million\
    \ ha,\nwhich represents over 70% of the global irrigated area. Of the 230 million\
    \ ha of irrigated land area, 60%\nis located in China and India [3]. It is estimated\
    \ that 75% of the grain production in China is dependent\non irrigation [2]. Sarma\
    \ [6] noted that India uses as much as four times more water to produce one\n\
    unit of a major food crop as compared to the USA and Europe. This implies that\
    \ an improvement\nin water use efﬁciency in the developing world would conserve\
    \ at least half of the water presently\napplied in irrigation.\nIt is estimated\
    \ that a water volume of 2630 km3 is abstracted yearly from surface and ground\n\
    water sources for irrigated crop production. The absence of surface water sources\
    \ in a number of\ncommunities has further increased the pressure on groundwater\
    \ resources. This has resulted in the\nover-abstraction of global groundwater\
    \ sources which is calculated to be as much as 163 km3 per\nannum [2]. A global\
    \ shortage in freshwater sources is predicted unless action is taken to improve\
    \ water\nmanagement and increase water use efﬁciency. This has necessitated greater\
    \ regulatory demands for\nenvironmental protection of freshwater [7]. It is reported\
    \ that only half of the total freshwater volume\nabstracted for irrigation globally\
    \ reaches the targeted crops [2]. These have brought about the need to\ndevise\
    \ procedures to use the limited water more efﬁciently while maximizing crop yield\
    \ and quality.\nConventional irrigation practice involves applying water uniformly\
    \ over every part of the ﬁeld\nwithout taking into account the spatial variability\
    \ in soil and crop water needs; this consequently leads\nto overirrigation in\
    \ some parts of the ﬁeld while other parts of the ﬁeld are underirrigated [8].\
    \ The risks\nassociated with overirrigation include surface runoff, deep percolation\
    \ and leaching of nitrates and\nnutrients. Those associated with underirrigation\
    \ are more subjective and include reduction in crop\nyields and quality, as well\
    \ as inefﬁcient use of fertilizer and other supplemental inputs for crop\nproduction\
    \ [9].\nThe irrigation process requires a high level of ‘precision’ in order to\
    \ optimize the water input\nand crop response, while minimizing adverse environmental\
    \ impacts. Precision irrigation is an\nevolving ﬁeld with active interest by both\
    \ industry and academic researchers. It is conceptualized by\nsome researchers\
    \ as the use of efﬁcient irrigation application systems, whereas others view it\
    \ as the\nvariable application of irrigation based on predeﬁned maps or sensor\
    \ feedback [10]. Smith et al. [11]\nsuggested that ‘precision’ involves the accurate\
    \ determination, quantiﬁcation of crop water needs and\nthe precise application\
    \ of the optimal water volume at the required time. This implies that varying\n\
    water application spatially is not the sole requirement for the achievement of\
    \ ‘precision’ in the irrigation\nprocess. Hence, precision irrigation can be deﬁned\
    \ as the process of accounting for the ﬁeld-scale\nspatial variability in crop\
    \ water need and applying the right amount of water to match the spatial crop\n\
    water need at the right time [9]. The advantages associated with precision irrigation\
    \ include increased\ncrop yields, improved crop quality, improved water use efﬁciency/savings,\
    \ reduction of energy costs\nand reduction of adverse environmental impacts [12].\
    \ Pierce [13] viewed precision irrigation as a\ntool for improving sustainability\
    \ in irrigated agriculture in terms of improved irrigation water use\nefﬁciency\
    \ and improved environmental quality of irrigated ﬁelds.\nThe balance of several\
    \ core aspects is however important for the successful implementation of\na robust\
    \ precision irrigation system. Implementing a precision irrigation system involves\
    \ efforts on\nreal-time monitoring of crop and soil conditions, scheduling irrigation\
    \ and control of the irrigation\napplication equipment. Research has been mainly\
    \ focused on the sensing and control aspects of\nprecision irrigation with much\
    \ advancements in the last decade [12]. Research is limited, however,\nin the\
    \ development of appropriate irrigation scheduling tools for the precision irrigation\
    \ process [14].\nIrrigation scheduling is the process by which a producer determines\
    \ when to apply irrigation and\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n3 of 29\nthe amount\
    \ of irrigation water to apply [15]. Hornbuckle et al. [16] suggested that the\
    \ irrigation\nscheduling endeavour should be treated as an all-encompassing decision\
    \ support system for irrigation\nmanagement. A robust decision support system\
    \ is important in the successful implementation of\nprecision irrigation. The\
    \ need for a decision support system capable of real-time management decisions\n\
    of when, where and how much to irrigate while also considering uncertainty in\
    \ climatic inputs,\nthe time-varying nature of cropping systems, as well as equipment\
    \ and operational limitations cannot\nbe overemphasized. Rhodig and Hillyer [17]\
    \ noted that the development of an optimal decision support\ntool for precision\
    \ irrigation will involve the combination of appropriate modeling and management\n\
    tools. The decision support tools available for precision irrigation management\
    \ are presently inﬂexible\nand difﬁcult to adapt to varying cropping scenarios\
    \ [18].\nIn recent years, there has been a number of in-depth reviews on precision\
    \ irrigation (e.g., [9,16]),\nand our intention is not to repeat the areas they\
    \ addressed. Rather, our aim is to provide an in-depth\ntechnical analysis of\
    \ the considerations necessary for the development of a practical and robust decision\n\
    support system for precision irrigation in order to improve sustainable irrigated\
    \ agriculture. To that\nend, the review will focus on the following critical aspects\
    \ of precision irrigation: (1) monitoring\nconsiderations; (2) present limitations\
    \ and state of the art in decision support; and (3) opportunities for\nimproving\
    \ sustainability. We will however include brief sections on the concept of spatial\
    \ variability\nand the control of water application in precision irrigation.\n\
    2. Spatial Variability: The Long-Term Challenge of Irrigated Agriculture\nThe\
    \ underlying argument for precision irrigation is the presence of within-ﬁeld\
    \ spatial variability\nthat inﬂuences crop water demand. The spatial variability\
    \ in crop water demand may have a direct\ninﬂuence on the crop yield, quality\
    \ and the environmental quality of irrigated ﬁelds [19]. The soil water\npresents\
    \ the sole source of water available for direct plant uptake and therefore its\
    \ spatial variability\nwill have a direct inﬂuence on crop water demand. Soil\
    \ and landscape characteristics like soil texture,\ntopography, abiotic and management\
    \ factors (e.g., compaction, tillage) and hydraulic properties vary\nspatially\
    \ across a ﬁeld [11]. These have a direct inﬂuence on the water-holding capacity\
    \ of the soil.\nHedley and Yule [20] reported that the spatial variation in the\
    \ soil water retention characteristics was\nstrongly correlated with the spatial\
    \ variation in soil texture across a ﬁeld, noting that areas with heavier\nsoils\
    \ within a ﬁeld had a larger water-holding capacity in comparison to those with\
    \ light textured\nsoils. The advent of rapid non-invasive technologies for mapping\
    \ soil properties, speciﬁcally electrical\nconductivity mapping, can reveal within-ﬁeld\
    \ variability that can guide in variable rate irrigation\nmanagement. These have\
    \ been successfully applied by Hedley and Yule [21] and Daccache et al. [8].\n\
    Readers are directed to [22,23] for a comprehensive overview of electrical conductivity\
    \ mapping.\nThe variability in yield across a ﬁeld has also been found to be strongly\
    \ correlated with the spatial\nvariability in water available for crop use. The\
    \ spatial variability in crop yield is a function of the\ninterplay between water\
    \ stress, nutrients, in addition to soil’s physical and chemical properties [24].\n\
    The yield map can be correlated with the soil electrical conductivity (EC) map.\
    \ These similarities can be\nexplained through the spatial variability of soil\
    \ properties that exists across a ﬁeld. The water-holding\ncapacity of the soil\
    \ is a major factor affecting yield, and the yield map will likely show a strong\n\
    correlation to soil EC [25]. Irmak et al. [26] noted that the spatial variability\
    \ in soil water retention\ncharacteristics played a dominant role in explaining\
    \ the spatial yield variability observed in soybean.\nMartinez-Casasnovas et al.\
    \ [27] suggested yield mapping as an important tool in variable rate\nirrigation\
    \ management.\nA robust precision irrigation system will be able to meet the spatially\
    \ varying crop water demand\nacross a ﬁeld at the right time. This requires accurate\
    \ knowledge of the within-ﬁeld variability. This\nis addressed by applying the\
    \ concept of irrigation management zones/units in precision irrigation.\nThe irrigation\
    \ management zones are a group of homogeneous units with similar soil water retention\n\
    characteristics [21]. It is however important that these management zones are\
    \ large enough to be\nmanaged individually while remaining relatively homogeneous\
    \ in order to reﬂect the spatial soil\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n4 of 29\n\
    variation across the units. The delineation of irrigation management zones based\
    \ on real-time sensor\ndata has also been demonstrated. This is achieved by applying\
    \ infrared thermometry/thermography\nto assess the spatial variation in crop canopy\
    \ temperature across a ﬁeld [28]. The crop canopy\ntemperature of a healthy transpiring\
    \ crop will often be less than that of the ambient air. When crop\ntranspiration\
    \ is reduced as a result of water deﬁcits, the crop canopy temperature is expected\
    \ to increase.\nThe characterization of crop water status as a function of the\
    \ canopy and ambient temperature is the\nbasis for using infrared thermometry/thermography\
    \ as a mapping tool for precision irrigation [29].\nShaughnessy et al. [30] and\
    \ Evett et al. [31] have successfully applied this procedure in generating\ndynamic\
    \ maps to guide variable rate water application for ﬁeld crops grown under a center\
    \ pivot\nsystem. It should, however, be noted that infrared temperature measurements\
    \ are usually taken over\na short period, mostly at midday when the crop is expected\
    \ to experience the highest evaporative\ndemand. Hence, this method is well suited\
    \ for crop production systems in which the soil moisture\ndynamics has relatively\
    \ long time constants.\n3. Spatial Scales of Irrigation Management\nCentre pivot,\
    \ lateral move and low energy precision application (LEPA) moving machines can\
    \ be\nmodiﬁed to apply spatially variable irrigation [32]. These systems are particularly\
    \ suited to variable\nrate water application because of their current level of\
    \ automation and large coverage area with\na single lateral pipe. Fixed irrigation\
    \ systems also have potential to be deployed for variable rate\nwater application\
    \ as they can be very accurate and can be automated based on sensor feedback [2].\n\
    Implementing a spatially varied irrigation system requires an understanding of\
    \ the characteristics of\nthe irrigation application system deployed including\
    \ the spatial scales covered by the water application\nequipment. The spatial\
    \ scale associated with the variability in crop water requirements and its impact\n\
    on yield should also be identiﬁed [32].\nO’Shaughnessy et al. [33] suggested that\
    \ the size and numbers of irrigation management zones\nthat can be controlled\
    \ in a precision irrigation strategy will determine the overall ﬂexibility of\
    \ the\nsystem. For moving application systems, the width of the management zone\
    \ is dependent on the\nnumber of drops or nozzles within an individually controlled\
    \ set (i.e., sprinklers controlled by a single\nsolenoid valve) and the length\
    \ will be dependent on the pattern of variability in the direction of the\ntraveling\
    \ sprinkler. The wind speed and the overlap from the wetted sprinkler patterns\
    \ between\nmanagement zones will also affect the accuracy of the water volume\
    \ applied. Raine and McCarthy [32]\nnoted that the spray diameter and overlap\
    \ achieved by moving application systems make it impossible\nto target water applications\
    \ on a single crop basis using these systems. Hedley et al. [2] suggested that\n\
    the economic beneﬁts of spatially varied irrigation should be an important consideration\
    \ even when\nthe system is considered achievable from a technical standpoint.\
    \ The spatial scales associated with\nmoving and ﬁxed irrigation systems is presented\
    \ in Table 1. Smith et al. [11] concluded that the spatial\nresolution of a precision\
    \ irrigation system will be inﬂuenced by the spatial scales associated with the\n\
    application system, spatial resolution of the inﬁeld sensors and the spatial scales\
    \ associated with the\nvariability in crop water requirements.\nTable 1. Spatial\

    \ in Precision Irrigation\nThe water application system used in the precision\
    \ irrigation process must be able to control the\nwater application volume applied\
    \ per unit time to each deﬁned irrigation management unit within a\nﬁeld [13].\
    \ The development of variable rate water application systems has been mostly focused\
    \ on\ncontinuous move systems [11].\nThe control of water application on continuous\
    \ move systems (centre pivot, linear move, boom\nand reel) is based on databases\
    \ of spatially referenced data deﬁning irrigation management units [20].\nThe\
    \ volume of water applied to each management unit can be achieved by varying the\
    \ application rate\nof sprinklers or controlling the ground speed of continuous\
    \ move systems [13].\nThe application rate of sprinklers is mostly varied through\
    \ the pulse modulation of the sprinkler\nnozzles. This involves the application\
    \ of normally opened solenoid valves to control ﬂow through\nan individual or\
    \ group of sprinkler heads. The solenoid turns the ﬂow of water either on or off\
    \ at\na sprinkler location in order to achieve a desired application depth within\
    \ a speciﬁed cycle time.\nThe cycle time is the total number of switching (either\
    \ to on or off phase) required by the solenoid\nvalves during a pulse cycle [34].\
    \ Evans et al. [34] applied the pulse modulated sprinkler control\non a linear\
    \ move sprinkler system. Daccache et al. [8] also applied a pulsed modulated sprinkler\n\
    control on a boom and reel irrigation system. Field evaluation of both systems\
    \ indicated a satisfactory\nperformance over a range of water application rates.\
    \ They however noted a problem with sprinkler\noverlap at the edge of the irrigation\
    \ management units.\nThe variation in irrigation volume applied by a continuous\
    \ move system can also be achieved by\nvarying its travel speed. The sprinklers\
    \ on the manifold of the irrigation system are usually operated\nat a speciﬁed\
    \ ﬂow rate and pressure. An increase in travel speed of the system reduces the\
    \ application\ndepth and a decrease in the travel speed increases the application\
    \ depth [35]. This type of system\ncannot be applied in situations where variable\
    \ application depths are needed along the length of the\nirrigation system [34].\
    \ Al-Karadsheh [9] evaluated the performance of speed control in achieving\nvariable\
    \ water application rate on a linear move system. The wetted diameter of the sprinklers\
    \ was\nreported to be between 15.2 and 21.3 m. He reported that the system needed\
    \ to travel a minimum\ndistance of 16 m before a desired change in application\
    \ volume can be reached. This suggests that this\nsystem is not suitable for use\
    \ in applications where the management units are small in scale.\nThe adaptation\
    \ of ﬁxed irrigation systems for variable rate water application has been achieved\n\
    (e.g., [36]). Variable water rate application in these systems is usually achieved\
    \ either by individual\nnozzle or emitter control, or zone management [13]. Readers\
    \ are referred to [13] for a comprehensive\nreview of such systems. Miranda et\
    \ al. [37] described a distributed control system implemented to\nachieve variable\
    \ rate water application in a ﬁxed irrigation system operating in predeﬁned management\n\
    zones. Their results indicated that the system was able to apply the irrigation\
    \ volume required in\neach zone. Goumopoulos et al. [38] also implemented a variable\
    \ rate water application setup for a\nﬁxed irrigation system capable of zone-speciﬁc\
    \ irrigation of strawberries. Individual nozzle control\nin a micro-sprinkler\
    \ system has been demonstrated by Coates et al. [39]. They reported individual\n\
    control of 54 nodes in a vineyard with the system. The nozzle connected to each\
    \ node was capable of\nachieving a unique water application volume. They concluded\
    \ that the water requirements of each\ndeﬁned zone in the vineyard can be individually\
    \ met by the irrigation system. The authors reported a\npayback period of between\
    \ 3.5 and 4.5 years for the system.\n5. Monitoring\nThe routine or continuous\
    \ monitoring of moisture ﬂuxes in the soil–plant–atmosphere system is a\nfundamental\
    \ aspect of managing crop production in irrigated agriculture. Monitoring can\
    \ essentially\nbe viewed as the application of various sensing technologies in\
    \ determining and characterizing\nthe spatiotemporal ﬁeld-scale moisture dynamics\
    \ and plant water use. These sensing methods can\nbe classiﬁed under three broad\
    \ headings: soil-based, weather-based and plant-based sensing [40].\nSoil-based\
    \ sensing typically involves the use of sensors to determine the soil moisture\
    \ content or\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n6 of 29\npotential. This information\
    \ is then used to infer the amount of water available for plant use and\nits temporal\
    \ dynamics. The weather-based sensing involves the use of the crop evapotranspiration\n\
    to determine the temporal crop water use. The evapotranspiration is determined\
    \ using climatic\nvariables such as radiation, rainfall and wind speed [41,42].\
    \ The plant-based sensing involves the\ndetermination of plant water status which\
    \ is usually related to plant physiology. Measurements\nof canopy temperature,\
    \ stomatal resistance, sap ﬂow, leaf turgor pressure, stem diameter and leaf\n\
    thickness are used to infer plant water status [43].\nRecent advances in remote\
    \ sensing has enhanced the possibility of monitoring the spatial nature of\nboth\
    \ soil and crop water status. Remote sensing encompasses non-contact technologies\
    \ that are capable\nof sensing radiation reﬂected or emitted from agricultural\
    \ ﬁelds. They are deployed using satellites,\naerial platforms and tractors [44].\
    \ These technologies have a high spatial resolution and are well suited\nfor regional\
    \ soil and crop water evaluation [45]. This review focuses on sensing technologies\
    \ that can\nbe applied in monitoring ﬁeld-scale soil and crop water dynamics.\
    \ Readers are referred to [44,46] for a\ncomprehensive review of remote sensing\
    \ technologies applicable in precision agriculture.\n5.1. Soil-Based Sensing\n\
    The knowledge of soil moisture ﬂuxes comprising of the depletion and reﬁll of\
    \ soil water can be\nused to monitor crop water use hence making it a useful tool\
    \ in irrigation scheduling and management\ndecisions [47]. Several methods have\
    \ been developed for measuring soil moisture content; they are\nindirect methods\
    \ which rely on the strong relationship between a particular property of the soil\n\
    and the soil moisture content. Moreover, they are able to provide continuous monitoring\
    \ and are\nnon-destructive [48]. In precision irrigation, the commonly applied\
    \ method for monitoring the\ntemporal dynamics of ﬁeld-scale soil moisture is\
    \ the dielectric-based method [20]. This is because\nof the ease of their deployment\
    \ in large-scale soil moisture sensor networks [49]. Thus, the proper\ndeployment\
    \ and management of this technology can optimize the sustainability of irrigated\
    \ agriculture.\nConsequently, this section will outline a brief description of\
    \ this method including a consideration of\nthe factors affecting sensor performance.\
    \ For a more detailed description of other state-of-the-art soil\nmoisture sensing\
    \ technologies, readers are referred to [50,51].\n5.1.1. Dielectric Soil Moisture\
    \ Sensors\nDielectric soil moisture sensors operate by exploiting the dielectric\
    \ properties of soil and its\nconstituents [52]. The relative dielectric permittivity\
    \ of a substance is used to describe the effect of\nan electromagnetic ﬁeld on\
    \ its molecular structure. It is a dimensionless constant greater than one,\n\
    made up of a real and imaginary part [53]. The apparent relative dielectric permittivity\
    \ of soil, ε′soil\nis a function of its constituents majorly being water, air\
    \ and solid particles. The relative dielectric\npermittivity of the other constituents\
    \ except water has a negligible effect as they have small values in\nthe range\
    \ of 1–7. The one of water, ε′water having a value of approximately 80 has the\
    \ most remarkable\neffect. It is therefore possible to correlate the volumetric\
    \ moisture content (VMC) to ε′soil using\nempirical equations at a frequency range\
    \ of between 50 MHz and 17 GHz. At this high frequency\nrange, ε′soil is highly\
    \ stable and it usually referred to as the apparent dielectric permittivity of\
    \ soil [54].\nA range of electromagnetic sensors exploits this property to provide\
    \ a non-destructive in situ\nmeasurement of soil moisture contents. They include\
    \ time domain reﬂectometry (TDR) sensors, time\ndomain transmission (TDT) sensors\
    \ and capacitance sensors.\n5.1.2. Factors Affecting the Performance of Dielectric\
    \ Soil Moisture Sensors\nThe accuracy of data from soil moisture sensors is important\
    \ in the precision irrigation process.\nOver estimation of soil moisture status\
    \ may lead to a delay in irrigation scheduling decisions and\nconsequently affect\
    \ crop yield and quality. Underestimation of soil moisture status on the other\
    \ hand\nmay lead to application of irrigation too often or when not required by\
    \ the crops. This will result in\nwater/energy wastage and adverse environmental\
    \ effects.\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n7 of 29\nDielectric soil moisture sensors\
    \ measure the soil moisture content for the soil volume\ncorresponding to their\
    \ sphere of inﬂuence. The various factors affecting the performance of dielectric\n\
    soil moisture sensors include bulk electrical conductivity (salinity), soil texture,\
    \ bulk density and\ntemperature. A variation in any of these factors around the\
    \ sphere of inﬂuence of the dielectric sensor\nwill have an effect on its performance.\
    \ These properties vary with location and depth in a soil proﬁle\nand it is important\
    \ to take them into account when calibrating dielectric soil moisture sensors\
    \ [55].\nThese sensors often rely on site-speciﬁc calibration, but they often\
    \ come with ‘universal’ calibrations\nwhich can be used where absolute accuracy\
    \ is not required. The accuracy of calibration equations\nsupplied by manufacturers\
    \ of these sensors are usually between a range of ±4 - 2% VMC when applied\nin\
    \ non-saline soils [56]. Site-speciﬁc calibration equations which are developed\
    \ by comparing the\nsensor output to gravimetrically derived soil moisture content\
    \ can be applied when a higher level of\naccuracy is required [57]. In addition,\
    \ for capacitance type probes, it is essential that the probe access\ntubes are\
    \ ﬁtted correctly without air gaps to ensure robust soil water measurements. For\
    \ a detailed\ntechnical description of factors affecting the performance of dielectric\
    \ sensors, readers are referred\nto [58,59].\n5.2. Proximal Sensing and Mapping\
    \ of Soil Moisture\nThe recent advances in rapid mapping and positioning technologies\
    \ enables the spatial\ncharacterization of soil moisture retention properties\
    \ to inform precision irrigation decisions.\nThe electromagnetic induction (EM)\
    \ technique is used in combination with accurate positioning\nsystems to quantify\
    \ soil moisture variability at resolutions less than 10 m. It also provides a\
    \ highly\naccurate digital elevation map (DEM) [2].\nThe EM sensor maps the soil’s\
    \ apparent EC which is inﬂuenced by soil texture and moisture in\nnon-saline soils\
    \ [48]. Those same factors correlate highly to the soil’s water-holding capacity.\
    \ Based on\nthe EC maps, a targeted soil sampling can be conducted at different\
    \ parts of the ﬁeld. Topographic\nfeatures that are likely to inﬂuence ﬁeld-scale\
    \ soil moisture dynamics are derived using the DEM [60].\nThe EC maps enable the\
    \ grouping of discrete units known as management units with similar\navailable\
    \ water-holding capacity (AWC) characteristics which can then be used in selecting\
    \ soil\nmoisture monitoring sites. This has been demonstrated by [34,61]. The\
    \ data from soil moisture sensors\nlocated in the management units can also be\
    \ used in generating dynamic application maps based\non a relationship between\
    \ the soil moisture depletion and the mapped EC values. These application\nmaps\
    \ serve as an input into the precision irrigation control system. Hedley and Yule\
    \ [21] applied soil\nmoisture sensors and an EC map in generating dynamic water\
    \ status maps for a 35.2 ha irrigated\nmaize ﬁeld. Daccache et al. [8] applied\
    \ a similar method in producing dynamic soil moisture maps for\nvarious ﬁelds.\n\
    The electric resistivity tomography technique can also be applied in deriving\
    \ the EC map of a ﬁeld.\nHedley et al. [2] reported that the method has a good\
    \ vertical resolution but it cannot be deployed on a\nmoving platform for rapid\
    \ non-invasive mapping. It has been applied by Kelly et al. [62] in positioning\n\
    soil moisture sensors to support irrigation decisions.\nThe ground-penetrating\
    \ radar (GPR) can also be applied in monitoring the ﬁeld-scale soil moisture\n\
    status [50]. It can be mounted on a vehicle or moving irrigation system for mapping\
    \ soil moisture in a\nﬁeld. The GPR is however affected by high clay content,\
    \ is not amenable to automation and requires\nfurther development to improve its\
    \ viability in precision irrigation applications [63].\nThe deployment of soil\
    \ moisture sensors in management units defined by these mapping techniques\nenables\
    \ the dynamic updates of soil moisture maps which can aid variable rate water\
    \ application.\n5.3. Weather-Based Sensing\nWeather-based sensing involves the\
    \ use of climatic variables in determining ET which is indicative\nof the crops’\
    \ daily water use. Evaporation accounts for the direct evaporation of water to\
    \ the air from\nthe soil surface or canopy interception of either precipitation\
    \ or applied irrigation. Transpiration\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n8 of 29\n\
    accounts for the uptake of water by a plant and the subsequent loss of water as\
    \ vapor through stomata\nin its leaves, required for metabolic cooling of the\
    \ leaf to maintain photosynthesis without the leaf\noverheating [41]. Evapotranspiration\
    \ is generally viewed as a combination of the evaporation of water\nfrom the soil,\
    \ evaporation from the canopy surface and plant transpiration [64].\nThe evaporation\
    \ and transpiration process occur simultaneously and are often difﬁcult to\ndistinguish.\
    \ The predominance of each of these processes however varies at different crop\
    \ growth\nstages. At the initial crop growth stage, water is lost mainly in form\
    \ of evaporation from the soil\nsurface. As the development of the crop progresses,\
    \ transpiration becomes the major medium of water\nloss to the atmosphere [45].\n\
    The ET process is largely dependent on solar radiation, vapor pressure deﬁcit\
    \ of the atmosphere\nat any given time and wind speed. It is also inﬂuenced by\
    \ soil water content, the rate at which water\ncan be taken up from the soil by\
    \ the plant roots and crop characteristics (type, variety and growth\nstage) [64].\
    \ Readers are directed to [41,65] for a further discussion on the ET process.\n\
    The temporal dynamics of evapotranspiration on hourly or daily timescales is appropriate\n\
    for quantifying crop water use in the precision irrigation process. The United\
    \ Nations Food and\nAgriculture Organization Penman–Monteith (FAO-PM) equation\
    \ presents a procedure for computing\nhourly or daily ET values using standard\
    \ climatological measurements of solar radiation, air\ntemperature, humidity and\
    \ wind speed made at a height of 2 m above a fully transpiring grass\nsurface\
    \ [41]. These data can be obtained from automatic weather stations installed on\
    \ a speciﬁc ﬁeld or\nfrom a metrological network. The equation provides a basis\
    \ from which reference ET (ET from the\nwell-watered grass surface) for different\
    \ time periods can be calculated and to which ET from other\ncrops can be computed\
    \ using crop coefﬁcients, Kc [66]. The crop coefﬁcients are speciﬁc to each crop\n\
    and crop canopy cover, which is dependent on the crop growth stage. The Kc curve\
    \ deﬁned for a crop\nover its growth stage is generalized for regions with similar\
    \ climates. The Kc is however dependent on\nthe canopy dynamics including cover\
    \ fraction, leaf area index and greenness which may vary across\nregions with\
    \ similar climates [67]. This introduces errors into ET estimates derived using\
    \ the standard\nFAO-PM crop coefﬁcient approach. The FAO-PM method presents a\
    \ relatively easy procedure for\ndetermining the temporal dynamics of crop water\
    \ use. The crop coefﬁcient used in determining the\nactual ET of a particular\
    \ crop however needs to be estimated at each growth stage. It is noted in\nAllen\
    \ et al. [41] that reference ET can be overestimated by as much as 20% during\
    \ conditions of low\nevaporative demand.\nRemote sensing provides a means of overcoming\
    \ the shortcomings of the FAO-PM crop coefﬁcient\napproach of estimating crop\
    \ ET by providing real-time feedback on daily crop water use as inﬂuenced\nby\
    \ actual crop canopy dynamics, local climatic conditions and ﬁeld spatial variability\
    \ [68]. The remotely\nsensed normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) computed\
    \ from crop canopy reﬂectance\nmeasurements in the red and near-infrared (NIR)\
    \ wavelengths has been found to be a useful tool in\ncomputing accurate crop coefﬁcients\
    \ for a broad range of crops [69]. Singh et al. [70] has demonstrated\nthe use\
    \ of the calculated reference ET and the remotely sensed NDVI in estimating the\
    \ water use of\ncotton. A similar procedure has also been demonstrated by Farg\
    \ et al. [67] for estimating the daily\nwater use of wheat.\nThe surface renewal\
    \ analysis method presents an opportunity for assessing the real-time temporal\n\
    dynamics of crop water use. The surface renewal (SR) method is used to determine\
    \ the sensible heat\nwhich can then be applied to the energy balance equation\
    \ to determine the latent heat (i.e., ET) [71]. It is\nbased on analyzing the\
    \ temperature time series generated from monitoring the change in heat content\n\
    of air parcels that interact with the crop canopy. When an air parcel comes in\
    \ contact with the crop\ncanopy, the air temperature remains constant for a brief\
    \ time period known as the quiescent period.\nThe temperature of the air parcel\
    \ however increases after this time period as energy is transferred\nto it from\
    \ the crop canopy. The increase in temperature continues until the air parcel\
    \ is replaced by\ncooler air from the atmosphere. At this time, the temperature\
    \ of the air shows a sharp drop [72].\nA high frequency trace of this temperature\
    \ renewal event exhibits a ramp-like function. Applying\nSustainability 2017,\
    \ 9, 353\n9 of 29\nstructure function theory to the ramp function enables the\
    \ determination of the sensible heat ﬂux.\nThe instrumentation requirement for\
    \ an SR system is minimal, consisting of small diameter ﬁne wire\nthermocouples\
    \ or a two-dimensional sonic anemometer and a high frequency data acquisition\
    \ system\n(2 Hz to 10 Hz) [71]. Standard climatological measurements are also\
    \ required to obtain the other\nparameters in the energy balance equation.\nThe\
    \ SR technique requires that measurements are taken at a minimum height above\
    \ the crop\ncanopy. It is assumed that the canopy is homogeneous and able to absorb\
    \ all the momentum transferred\nto it by the ambient airﬂow [73]. This assumption\
    \ introduces errors in ET estimates over ﬁelds\nwith variable canopy structures.\
    \ Castellvi and Snyder [74] concluded that the technique can be\napplied for estimating\
    \ ET from short and dense canopy crops as they are mostly decoupled from\nthe\
    \ environment. The technique also requires calibration using an eddy covariance\
    \ system or a\nlysimeter. This may limit its practicality for farm-scale deployment.\
    \ The SR methodology proposed by\nCastellvi [75], however, does not require calibration.\
    \ Rosa and Tanny [76], Shapland and Snyder [72],\nand Rosa et al. [77] have reported\
    \ highly accurate hourly ET estimates from various crops using a\nsurface renewal\
    \ analysis system.\n5.4. Plant-Based Sensing\nThe importance of plant-based monitoring\
    \ becomes emphasized when studying the effect of\nwater deﬁcit on plants and its\
    \ relation to plant water status. The temporal dynamics of crop water use\ncan\
    \ be monitored using a number of plant-based methods. They include methods that\
    \ require direct\ncontact with the plant and those that require only proximal\
    \ contact with the plants [78]. The contact\nsensors are useful in monitoring\
    \ the temporal dynamics of the plant water status while the proximal\nsensors\
    \ are capable of assessing the spatial nature of crop water status across a ﬁeld\
    \ and hence\nwell suited for the precision irrigation process [11]. A good understanding\
    \ of the various aspects of\nplant water status and plant drought physiology is\
    \ important in the successful application of these\nsystems. Readers are directed\
    \ to [79,80] for a comprehensive overview of plant-based sensing methods\napplicable\
    \ in irrigation management. Plant-based sensing systems measure either the plant\
    \ water\ncontent, plant water potential or the plant physiological response to\
    \ moisture deﬁcits. A summary of\nvarious plant-based sensing systems is given\
    \ in Table 2. It should be noted that many of these require\nskilled manpower\
    \ and considerable management time for their operation.\nTable 2. Summary of plant-based\
    \ monitoring methods.\nPlant-Based Measurement\nAdvantage\nDisadvantage\nPlant\

    \ and difﬁcult to implement in\nhumid climates\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n\
    10 of 29\n5.5. Thermal Sensing\nPlant canopy temperature is a widely accepted\
    \ variable indicative of plant water status.\nThe stomata controls evaporative\
    \ cooling of the leaves based on soil water status and prevailing\nenvironmental\
    \ conditions.\nIt closes due to increased water deﬁcits and a reduction in plant\n\
    transpiration causing an increase in plant canopy temperature [91]. The measurement\
    \ of the crop\ncanopy temperature by infrared thermometry which is then normalized\
    \ using an index such as the\ncrop water stress index (CWSI) can be used in determining\
    \ the plant water status and its response to\nwater deﬁcits [79].\nThe CWSI is\
    \ a well-established method of accounting for the variation in canopy temperature\
    \ as\na function of prevailing microclimatological conditions and water deﬁcits\
    \ [92]. It relates the difference\nin the crop canopy temperature measured using\
    \ infrared thermometry to the air temperature as a\nfunction of atmospheric vapor\
    \ deﬁcit [93]. This temperature difference is then related to an upper\nand lower\
    \ temperature baseline to determine a water stress index. The upper baseline represents\n\
    a non-transpiring crop and the lower baseline represents a fully transpiring crop\
    \ under the same\nprevailing environmental condition [30]. The CWSI is a dimensionless\
    \ value of between 0 and 1, with a\nvalue of 0 indicating a well-watered crop\
    \ and a value of 1 indicating a severely water-stressed crop [93].\nBiotic factors\
    \ can also induce stress in a plant thus affecting transpiration rate, crop water\
    \ use and\ncanopy temperature. These biotic factors also affect leaf colour and\
    \ morphology which in turn affects\nthe optical properties of the crop canopy\
    \ [94]. In order to successfully apply infrared thermometry as a\ntool for assessing\
    \ plant water status, it is important to differentiate between abiotic (such as\
    \ water stress)\nand biotic stresses (such as plant diseases and pest infestation).\
    \ Multiband optical sensors could be\napplied in detecting various crop diseases\
    \ and crop infestation within a ﬁeld by computing vegetation\nindices based on\
    \ canopy reﬂectance measurements [33]. This has been applied by Garcia-Ruiz et\
    \ al. [95]\nfor detecting citrus greening and by Yang et al. [96] for detecting\
    \ infestation of green bugs and aphids\nin wheat. It may be useful to outﬁt precision\
    \ irrigation systems with these sensors.\nThe main advantage of thermal sensing\
    \ for precision irrigation application is related to the\nnon-contact and real-time\
    \ capability of the system. Infrared thermometry and thermography provide\nthe\
    \ opportunity to map the spatial variation in crop water status which can guide\
    \ in variable rate\nirrigation management. The use of thermal sensing for guiding\
    \ zone-speciﬁc water application has\nbeen demonstrated as noted in Section 2.\n\
    A major problem faced in applying the thermal sensing approach is the establishment\
    \ of the\nbaseline temperatures. In climates in which the air humidity is often\
    \ high, variations in wind speed and\nnet radiation introduce signiﬁcant errors\
    \ in the estimation of the lower limit baseline temperature [97].\nA number of\
    \ studies have been conducted to develop procedures for enhancing the possibility\
    \ of\napplying measurements of crop canopy temperature in inferring plant water\
    \ status in humid regions.\nJones [98] provides an excellent summary of these\
    \ research efforts. They include the use of well-watered\nplots to substitute\
    \ for empirical non-water stressed baselines, although these well-watered plots\
    \ are\nrarely available in practice. The use of artiﬁcial reference surfaces for\
    \ measuring baseline temperatures\nhas been proposed but it is reported that these\
    \ artiﬁcial reference surfaces differ signiﬁcantly in thermal\nand radiative properties\
    \ in comparison to real leaves. A modeling approach to simulating the canopy\n\
    resistance of well-watered plants has also been investigated but this is limited\
    \ by the difﬁculties\nencountered in correctly modeling stomata behavior and hence\
    \ canopy resistance. The possibility\nof including a wide range of metrological\
    \ data including net radiation and vapor pressure deﬁcit in\nderiving CWSI models\
    \ for humid climates has also been investigated. The mathematical complexity\n\
    typical of the models however limit their practical application.\nAnother problem\
    \ commonly encountered in applying infrared measurements of canopy\ntemperature\
    \ in inferring plant water status is the inclusion of soil temperature and other\
    \ background\ntemperature including the sky and stems in the measured canopy temperature.\
    \ This usually leads to\nerrors in estimation of the canopy temperature as the\
    \ soil and background temperature are usually\nmany degrees different from the\
    \ canopy temperature [90]. Jones [99] proposed the use of narrow\nSustainability\
    \ 2017, 9, 353\n11 of 29\nacceptance angle infrared sensors that can be positioned\
    \ to view only single leaves as a solution to this\nproblem. It has however been\
    \ found that the temperature estimates of single leaves determined\nby this method\
    \ is mostly not representative of the temperature of the plant canopy.\nA dense\n\
    deployment of infrared sensors may seem an alternative but this may be prohibitive\
    \ in terms of\ncost for practical applications.\nThe advancements in the ﬁeld\
    \ of thermal imagery and the recent availability of low-cost thermal\ncameras\
    \ has presented the possibility of overcoming the problems associated with the\
    \ inclusion of\nsoil and background temperatures in the measured canopy temperature.\
    \ Thermal imagery allows\nfor the average temperature of a deﬁned area to be obtained\
    \ and also the separation of background\ntemperature from the area of interest.\
    \ The temperature of a large number of individual leaves\nmaking up a canopy can\
    \ be included in an image while the soil and background temperature can be\ndiscarded\
    \ by applying automated image processing techniques [92]. Gonzalez-Dugo et al.\
    \ [100] has\ndemonstrated the use of thermal imagery in mapping the crop water\
    \ status in a commercial orchard\nin Spain. They also demonstrated the rapid mapping\
    \ of ﬁeld-scale crop water status by deploying\nthermal imaging equipment on an\
    \ unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV).\nPlant-based sensing methods including thermal\
    \ sensing only provide information on the need for\nirrigation and provide no\
    \ information on the volume of irrigation application needed. They are used\n\
    in combination with soil-based sensing for this reason [19].\n6. Decision Support\n\
    A decision support system for irrigation management and scheduling provides a\
    \ framework\nfor incorporating various tools and techniques for site-speciﬁc irrigation\
    \ decisions. The widespread\ncommercial adoption of precision irrigation will\
    \ be predicated on the development of robust and\noptimal decision support systems\
    \ [19].\nA number of decision support systems schedule irrigation at predeﬁned\
    \ intervals and apply\npredeﬁned irrigation volumes. They do not incorporate any\
    \ form of sensor feedback on plant water\nstatus, soil water status and climatic\
    \ variables [101]. This ‘open-loop’ strategy is largely designed based\non heuristics\
    \ and historical data. Mareels et al. [102] suggested that this is an inefﬁcient\
    \ approach often\nleading to overwatering and waste of fertilizer and other supplemental\
    \ crop inputs.\nClosed-loop irrigation strategies aim to irrigate: when the soil\
    \ moisture content reaches a certain\nthreshold [103–105]; when plant sensors\
    \ indicate a certain stress threshold [93,106,107] or with feedback\nfrom crop\
    \ simulation models with the aim of attaining a certain yield, crop physiological\
    \ response or\neconomic objective [108]. These closed-loop irrigation strategies\
    \ have been shown to improve water\nuse efﬁciency in the production of horticultural\
    \ crops under protected environments. Environmental\nconditions in such production\
    \ systems can be controlled based on plant feedback which eliminates the\nstochastic\
    \ plant response often encountered in ﬁeld-scale crop production [109]. Belayneh\
    \ et al. [110]\nimplemented a wireless sensor network of soil moisture sensors\
    \ for closed-loop irrigation control in\na pot-in-pot nursery. A signiﬁcant reduction\
    \ in water use was achieved by the system. The authors\nalso reported a 2.7-year\
    \ payback period for the system. Chappell et al. [111] reported water savings\
    \ of\n83% for a closed-loop irrigation control system implemented in a protected\
    \ crop production system.\nThey noted that there was less occurrence of plant\
    \ diseases in the nursery due to the elimination of\nover-watering. Saavoss et\
    \ al. [112] reported a 65% increase in proﬁt due to the implementation of a\n\
    wireless sensor network-based closed-loop control system in a nursery. The authors\
    \ noted that the\nincrease in proﬁt was due to improvement in crop quality and\
    \ yield resulting from the precise control\nof irrigation applications.\nIn ﬁeld-scale\
    \ crop production, the crop needs vary over time and space due to both biotic\
    \ and\nabiotic factors [9]. McCarthy et al. [113] noted that in these crop production\
    \ systems, closed-loop\nstrategies are unable to account for unknown crop dynamics,\
    \ the stochastic nature of climatic variables\nand crop response, and the time-varying\
    \ nature of the soil-plant-atmosphere system. This last\npoint is especially due\
    \ to crop growth, crop management and infestation of pests and diseases.\nSustainability\
    \ 2017, 9, 353\n12 of 29\nThe closed-loop systems are also unable to consider\
    \ equipment and other operational limitations.\nMcCarthy et al. [114] concluded\
    \ that an optimal decision support system must be ‘adaptive’ with\nthe ability\
    \ of accommodating the temporal and spatial variability within the ﬁeld. The decision\n\
    support system must also have the capability of modifying irrigation decisions\
    \ in response to crop\nphysiology, uncertainties in climatic inputs, soil, irrigation\
    \ systems and water supply limitations,\neconomic considerations and the quality\
    \ of sensor feedback.\n6.1. Adaptive Decision Support\nThe characteristics of\
    \ a cropping system varies over time. Within a cropped system, the properties\n\
    that will typically vary within and between seasons include crop growth, soil\
    \ properties (due to\naddition of nutrients and other management processes) and\
    \ climate. This will have a direct inﬂuence\non the irrigation timing and volume\
    \ required for optimal crop growth [11].\nAn adaptive decision support system\
    \ is able to continuously re-adjust the irrigation scheduling\nalgorithm in order\
    \ to retain the desired performance of the irrigation system [114]. The adaptive\n\
    decision support system is able to utilize historical or real-time sensor data\
    \ to arrive at irrigation\ntiming and volume that adequately accounts for the\
    \ temporal and spatial variability in the ﬁeld [114].\nIn control theory an adaptive\
    \ control system is generally accepted as a control system able to adjust\nits\
    \ controller parameters based on sensor feedback from a process, such that the\
    \ controlled process\nbehaves in a desirable way [11]. McCarthy et al. [108] noted\
    \ that an adaptive decision support system\nfor irrigation may either be sensor-based\
    \ if they use direct sensor measurements for the irrigation\nstrategy or model-based\
    \ if they use a calibrated simulation model to aid irrigation decisions.\nThe\
    \ development of adaptive decision support systems presents an opportunity to\
    \ improve\nsustainability in precision irrigation through improved water use and\
    \ crop productivity. They will\nalso enhance synergistic applications of data\
    \ available from soil, plant and weather sensors to arrive at\noptimal irrigation\
    \ scheduling decisions [108].\nIn this section we will present a brief discussion\
    \ on state-of-the-art of adaptive decision support\nsystems. We will thereafter\
    \ discuss the opportunities these systems present in improving sustainability\n\
    in irrigated agriculture. Readers are referred to [113] for a comprehensive overview\
    \ on the application\nof advanced process control to irrigation, details on methods\
    \ of operation and a consideration of\nfundamental control concepts as they apply\
    \ to irrigation scheduling.\n6.1.1. Mechanistic Models\nA number of irrigation\
    \ decision support systems are based on complex physical models which\nclosely\
    \ resemble the actual physical system [115]. They are able to incorporate the\
    \ physiological and\nmorphological representation of the plant into the decision\
    \ support tool. Barnard and Bauerle [116]\ndescribed an irrigation scheduling\
    \ system based on the spatially explicit biophysical model, MAESTRA\n(Multi-Array\
    \ Evaporation Stand Tree Radiation A), which couples the within-canopy photosynthesis\n\
    and stomatal conductance. Data on leaf temperature, canopy aerodynamics and environmental\n\
    variables are used as inputs into the model to predict the plant transpiration.\
    \ They reported that\nthe model-based tool applied between 18% and 56% more water\
    \ than a sensing-based method for\nscheduling irrigation in four species. They,\
    \ however, noted that the model-based approach produced\ngreater tree growth.\
    \ Asher et al. [117] described a mechanistic model capable of inferring crop water\n\
    requirements. The model employs leaf temperature data as input for determining\
    \ the crop aerodynamic\ncharacteristics which is then used in the Penman–Monteith\
    \ equation for calculating the actual crop\nET. A major drawback of these mechanistic\
    \ models is that they include static parameters which, once\nidentiﬁed, are assumed\
    \ to remain constant over the cropping season. This is rarely so in practice as\
    \ the\ncropping system varies over time due to both biotic and abiotic factors.\n\
    Sustainability 2017, 9, 353\n13 of 29\n6.1.2. Simulations\nCrop simulation models\
    \ based on ﬁrst principle physical models of crop phenology, soil physics\nand\
    \ hydrology can be applied in simulating the crop response to irrigation and cropping\
    \ system\nmanagement [115]. These simulation models provide the opportunity to\
    \ evaluate the beneﬁt of several\nprecision irrigation strategies as they eliminate\
    \ the need for time-consuming ﬁeld experiments [118].\nThey can be interfaced\
    \ with real-time sensor feedback from soil or plant sensors and weather data to\n\
    determine daily irrigation requirements of crops. They can also be used in predicting\
    \ the yield impact\nof an irrigation strategy. This is achieved by employing weather\
    \ forecast data in computing a daily soil\nmoisture balance and assessing the\
    \ impact of soil moisture deﬁcits on crop growth [118].\nDeJonge et al. [14] investigated\
    \ the effect of variable rate irrigation management on corn\nproduction in Iowa\
    \ using the CERES-maize model. Corn yield was compared for a period of 28 years\n\
    under simulated scenarios of no irrigation, scheduled uniform irrigation and precision\
    \ irrigation. They\nreported no signiﬁcant difference in corn yield and water\
    \ use between the uniform irrigation and\nprecision irrigation scenarios. Thorp\
    \ et al. [24] described a methodology for applying the Decision\nSupport System\
    \ for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) crop growth model in analyzing variable\
    \ rate\nmanagement practices including irrigation on crop growth and yield. The\
    \ platform enabled the\nevaluation of precision irrigation strategies on crop\
    \ performance in predeﬁned management zones.\nThese systems are however incapable\
    \ of real-time decision support and can only be applied using\nhistorical data.\n\
    McCarthy et al. [114] proposed a simulation framework, VARIwise, capable of real-time\
    \ decision\nsupport in precision irrigation. The simulation framework is capable\
    \ of incorporating real-time data\ninput from ﬁeld sensors in arriving at irrigation\
    \ decisions. The combination of different sensor inputs\ninto the simulation framework\
    \ enables adaptive decision support with the system being able to\nre-adjust irrigation\
    \ decisions based on plant feedback and also explore optimal control strategies.\n\
    Simulation models for use in irrigation decision support require extensive calibration\
    \ and\nvalidation to establish model accuracy. The limitation in data available\
    \ for this endeavour often\nlimit the use of the platforms to speciﬁc crops.\n\
    6.1.3. Artiﬁcial Intelligence\nArtiﬁcial intelligence presents the potential of\
    \ solving problems in precision irrigation which\nare complex, non-linear and\
    \ ill-deﬁned [119]. Artiﬁcial intelligence algorithms are able to emulate\nthe\
    \ human decision-making process when applied to a particular problem domain. They\
    \ have been\ndeployed for implementing adaptive decision support in irrigation\
    \ in form of artiﬁcial neural networks,\nfuzzy logic and expert systems with mixed\
    \ success to date [118–120].\nArtiﬁcial Neural Networks\nArtiﬁcial neural networks\
    \ (ANN) are non-linear mapping structures employed in modeling when\nthe underlying\
    \ data relationship is not well deﬁned. ANN are able to identify and learn correlations\n\
    between input data and corresponding target output values. They are able to predict\
    \ the outcome of\nnew independent data sets making them a useful tool in predictive\
    \ modeling [121]. ANN are well\nsuited for the irrigation decision support problem\
    \ that can often be complex and stochastic in nature.\nThese networks are also\
    \ adaptive in nature and are able to continuously learn in order to provide\n\
    optimal solutions to target problems in dynamic systems.\nKarasekreter et al.\
    \ [122] implemented an ANN for scheduling irrigation in a strawberry orchard\n\
    using soil moisture and its physical properties as model inputs. The system was\
    \ able to achieve water\nsavings of 20.5% and an energy saving of 23.9%. ANN however\
    \ require large datasets for training and\nare unable to describe the physical\
    \ dynamics of a system. This makes their use limited in real-time\ndecision support\
    \ tools.\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n14 of 29\nFuzzy Logic\nFuzzy logic is an\
    \ artificial intelligence algorithm that can be used to model a process and relate\
    \ it\nto human experience in arriving at decisions. A fuzzy logic system is made\
    \ up of a set used to classify\ninput data into membership classes, a decision\
    \ rule that is applied to each set which culminates in a\nhuman-like decision\
    \ output from the system [123]. A detailed description of the process is given\
    \ in [124].\nMousa and Abdullah [123] successfully applied a fuzzy logic model\
    \ in scheduling irrigation in\ndrip and sprinkler irrigation systems using ET,\
    \ soil moisture data and crop growth stage as model\ninputs. Prakashgoud and Desai\
    \ [124] employed a fuzzy logic system using soil moisture data, leaf\nwetness\
    \ and climatological data as model inputs in order to implement irrigation scheduling\
    \ decisions.\nThe system was capable of maintaining soil moisture thresholds in\
    \ the speciﬁed range. Giusti and\nMarsili-Libelli [125] described an adaptive\
    \ irrigation decision support system implemented with fuzzy\nlogic. The system\
    \ incorporates a predictive model of the soil moisture and an inference system\
    \ for\nmaintaining the soil moisture within an acceptable threshold. The system\
    \ was reported to adapt\nirrigation decisions to rainfall uncertainty and produced\
    \ water savings of 13.55% over a simulation\nperiod of 168 days.\nThe accuracy\
    \ of fuzzy logic systems is largely tied to an in-depth knowledge of the system.\
    \ They\nalso lack an inner mechanistic structure with the domain of applicability\
    \ limited to the range of training\ndata used in setting them up. Delgoda et al.\
    \ [115] suggested that the points mentioned makes decision\nmaking with a fuzzy\
    \ system an ad hoc process limiting its application in adaptive decision support.\n\
    Expert Systems\nAn expert system is a tool able to emulate the reasoning process\
    \ a human expert would employ\nin a decision-making process in his/her ﬁeld of\
    \ expertise. It captures the human decision-making\nexpertise and heuristics representing\
    \ it in a series of rules and facts [126]. An expert system typically\nconsists\
    \ of a knowledge base component and an inference engine that acts as a reasoning\
    \ tool [127].\nExpert systems are especially suited to dynamic problems that are\
    \ of a complex nature. They are also\nwell suited to dealing with incomplete and\
    \ uncertain data [128]. This makes them well suited for\nirrigation decision support\
    \ which often requires the input of experts to arrive at optimal decisions.\n\
    Expert systems applied in irrigation decision support can be classiﬁed as either\
    \ ‘expert systems\nproper’ or hybrid expert systems. A detailed review on the\
    \ application of expert systems in irrigation\ndecision support is given in [128,129].\
    \ The ‘expert systems proper’ class of irrigation decision support\ntools schedule\
    \ irrigation based on soil moisture and climatic data. They are unable to consider\
    \ the\ntime-varying nature of the cropping system (crop growth, disease and pest\
    \ infestation) to arrive at\noptimal irrigation decisions. They are also unable\
    \ to account for the stochastic nature of climatic\nvariables and are not well\
    \ suited for real-time applications [129].\nHybrid expert systems which are also\
    \ referred to as model-based expert systems combine\nalgorithmic techniques and\
    \ a knowledge-based component in solving problems relevant to its\napplication\
    \ domain. Its advantage in irrigation is that optimal irrigation decision can\
    \ be made\nby combining expert knowledge with data feedback from inﬁeld sensors,\
    \ data-driven models and crop\nsimulation models [130]. Thomson and Ross [131]\
    \ described a model-based expert system designed\nfor decision support in irrigation\
    \ management. The system employs feedback from soil moisture\nsensors to adjust\
    \ the input of a crop simulation model, PNUTGRO (peanut crop growth simulation\n\
    model), and also incorporates the capability of sensor feedback validation. The\
    \ system was reported\nto maintain soil moisture at the deﬁned thresholds. Goumopoulos\
    \ et al. [38] developed an expert\nsystem-based adaptive decision support platform\
    \ for zone-speciﬁc irrigation of strawberry plants.\nThe system includes a wireless\
    \ sensor network of soil, climate and plant sensors providing feedback\nfor the\
    \ decision support system. It also includes a machine learning process capable\
    \ of inferring new\nrules and extending the knowledge base from logged data sets.\
    \ The system was reported to reduce\nirrigation water consumption by around 20%.\
    \ A hybrid expert system based on real-time soil moisture\ndata with the capability\
    \ of incorporating plant models is described in Kohanbash et al. [132].\nSustainability\
    \ 2017, 9, 353\n15 of 29\nThe performance of an expert system is largely dependent\
    \ on the effectiveness of the knowledge\nacquisition process. An error in this\
    \ process will drastically affect the system reliability and its performance.\n\
    6.1.4. Learning Control\nLearning control decision support strategies perform\
    \ systems identiﬁcation using sensor feedback\nwithout deﬁning a mathematical\
    \ model [113]. Systems identiﬁcation models a dynamic system based\non a time\
    \ series of measured input/output data [133]. A comprehensive overview on the\
    \ theory of\nsystems identiﬁcation is presented in [134].\nIterative learning\
    \ control can be applied in systems with ill-deﬁned models that operate\nrepetitively\
    \ and assume the same initial condition after each iteration.\nIt is well suited\
    \ to the\nirrigation problem as irrigation scheduling and application is a repetitive\
    \ problem over the crop\nseason. The time-varying nature of the soil–plant–atmosphere\
    \ system can also be viewed as an\nill-deﬁned problem. The strategy is also able\
    \ to improve system performance by eliminating the effects\nof a repeating disturbance\
    \ with undeﬁned dynamics. Applied to irrigation, this may be a measured\ncrop\
    \ response that reoccurs as a consequence of irrigation. The temporal changes\
    \ in crop water use\nand weather conditions are not considered [113].\nMcCarthy\
    \ et al. [114] noted that a drawback of the iterative learning approach may be\
    \ the\ninefﬁcient systems identiﬁcation resulting from the slow system dynamics\
    \ of the crop system in\nresponse to irrigation events. This results from the\
    \ evaluation of the effect of only one irrigation\nvolume on plant response at\
    \ any water application event. They suggested that this drawback may be\neliminated\
    \ by applying the process of iterative hill climbing control. This learning control\
    \ strategy\nemploys an adaptive varied identiﬁcation process. A range of irrigation\
    \ volumes are applied at each\nirrigation event to a number of test cells on the\
    \ ﬁeld. The response in the test cell that best matches\nthe desired system performance\
    \ is identiﬁed as the optimal irrigation process. They reported that\nthe iterative\
    \ hill climbing control procedure was capable of maximizing cotton yield when\
    \ used\nwith a combination of plant and soil sensors to provide feedback for the\
    \ identiﬁcation procedure.\nTheir conclusions were however based on results from\
    \ a simulation study and a ﬁeld-based validation\nof the procedure was not reported.\n\
    The results of the learning control procedure are based solely on sensor measurements\
    \ and may be\nlargely affected by sensor drift as a model of the crop response\
    \ is not developed from the identiﬁcation\nprocedure. This method can be considered\
    \ more of a “brute force” approach than a scientiﬁcally based\napproach to scheduling\
    \ irrigation.\n6.1.5. Model Predictive Control\nModel predictive control (MPC)\
    \ is an industrial control approach employed in decision support\nfor large-scale\
    \ multivariable problems with multiple constraints. It has been successfully implemented\n\
    in the food industry, petrochemical industry and power generation among others\
    \ [135]. Model\npredictive control employs a plant model and optimization algorithm\
    \ to calculate plant inputs in order\nto achieve a future value of a performance\
    \ criterion. The system performance is predicted over a ﬁnite\nhorizon subject\
    \ to constraints on both the inputs and outputs of the plant [101]. Readers are\
    \ directed\nto [135–137] for an in-depth review of the theory of model predictive\
    \ control and its application in\nvarious industries.\nIn the case of irrigation,\
    \ applying a soil moisture balance model, the plant input will be the\nirrigation\
    \ amount, the plant output will be the soil moisture deﬁcit, and both crop ET\
    \ and precipitation\nvalues will be considered as disturbances as they cannot\
    \ be controlled. A prediction of future input\nvalues and disturbances is required\
    \ in an MPC system in order to determine the optimal system\noutput [138]. This\
    \ highlights the need for the incorporation of weather forecast data into the\
    \ MPC\nframework for irrigation decision support.\nModel predictive control appears\
    \ to be well suited to the domain of irrigation decision support.\nThe irrigation\
    \ problem has input constraints in terms of optimal irrigation volume and output\n\
    Sustainability 2017, 9, 353\n16 of 29\nconstraints in terms of soil moisture thresholds\
    \ and the desired plant response to water deﬁcits [135].\nOoi et al. [139], Lozoya\
    \ et al. [101] and Saleem et al. [135] described a model predictive control\n\
    framework for irrigation scheduling based on a soil moisture balance model. They\
    \ employed a\nsystem identiﬁcation procedure to generate a grey box model of the\
    \ soil–plant–atmosphere system\nwith a network of soil moisture sensors providing\
    \ real-time feedback to the control algorithm. They\nall reported the ability\
    \ of the MPC platform to sufﬁciently predict crop irrigation needs and also\n\
    observations of signiﬁcant water savings. The authors of the discussed systems\
    \ however fail to account\nfor the stochastic nature of rainfall and crop water\
    \ use in the system dynamics. Delgoda et al. [138]\nnoted that an adequate consideration\
    \ of the uncertainty in rainfall and ET inputs into the water balance\nmodel employed\
    \ in the MPC framework will improve the capability of the MPC system.\nDelgoda\
    \ et al. [115] addressed the drawbacks noted in the above MPC frameworks by employing\n\
    disturbance afﬁne feedback control, an uncertainty modelling technique widely\
    \ applied in MPC\nto account for the stochastic nature of rainfall and crop water\
    \ use. A simple order model of soil\nmoisture dynamics is included in the system\
    \ to enable online calculation of model parameters, hence\naccounting for the\
    \ time-varying nature of soil-plant-atmosphere system. The authors reported an\n\
    optimal performance of the system in humid regions where considerable uncertainties\
    \ in climatic\nvariables exist.\n6.2. Commercial Sensor Applications in Adaptive\
    \ Decision Support\nManufacturers of sensors and a number of system integrators\
    \ are showing considerable interest\nin developing innovative tools that will\
    \ further optimize irrigation water use.\nA sensor integration project is described\
    \ by AgSmarts (Memphis, TN, USA). Moving irrigation\nsystems are equipped with\
    \ sensors which provide data on crop growth stage and soil proﬁle. Aquaspy\nsoil\
    \ moisture sensors (San Diego, CA, USA) positioned in various parts of the ﬁeld\
    \ also provide data\non soil moisture status which is applied in irrigation timing\
    \ and calculation of irrigation volumes.\nThese irrigation decisions are automatically\
    \ adjusted based on the varying water requirements at each\ncrop growth stage\
    \ [140].\nOmica, Italy has deployed a wireless sensor network of Libelium environmental\
    \ and soil moisture\nsensors (Zaragoza, Spain) on a maize farm in Italy to support\
    \ irrigation decisions. The sensors\nare interfaced to a geo-referenced decision\
    \ support system which enables zone-speciﬁc irrigation\nmanagement. The system\
    \ is able to predict crop yield based on irrigation timing and application\nvolumes\
    \ combined with historical yield data. This can then be applied in optimizing\
    \ the decision\nsupport system towards achieving a desired crop yield goal.\n\
    Most decision support systems presently produced for commercial use provide on/off\
    \ irrigation\ncontrol based on speciﬁed thresholds and plant/crop sensor feedback.\
    \ The incorporation of predictive\nmodels into these systems will enhance the\
    \ possibility of improving irrigation water use and crop\nyield [141].\n7. Opportunities\
    \ for Improving Sustainability\nSustainability is premised on the principle of\
    \ meeting the needs of the present generation without\ncompromising the ability\
    \ of future generations to meet their own needs. Sustainable agriculture is\n\
    focused on developing farming practices that are safe and do not have an adverse\
    \ impact on the\nenvironment [142].\nPretty [143] suggested that sustainable agriculture\
    \ integrates the main goals of environmental\nhealth and economic proﬁtability.\
    \ The efﬁcient and effective use of water is considered the main driver\nfor improving\
    \ sustainability in irrigated agriculture. This will involve the use of less water\
    \ for irrigating\ncrops and also preserving the quality of water sources. Conventional\
    \ irrigation practices apply water\nuniformly over a ﬁeld resulting in a high\
    \ volume of water use. Overirrigation may also result from\nthis practice which\
    \ causes leaching of nitrates and nutrients into ground water sources. An important\n\
    consideration would also be the use of less energy for operating water pumps and\
    \ irrigation application\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n17 of 29\nequipment. Soil\
    \ erosion continues to be a serious threat to sustainability in irrigated agriculture.\
    \ This\ncan be eliminated by applying precise irrigation volumes to reduce surface\
    \ runoff.\nPrecision irrigation presents a promising platform for improving sustainability\
    \ in irrigated\nagriculture. This is especially hinged on the possibility of eliminating\
    \ the adverse environmental\nimpacts related to conventional irrigation practices\
    \ with the adoption of precision irrigation.\nThe economic proﬁtability of the\
    \ adoption of precision irrigation is however a very important point\nto consider.\
    \ This will be manifested in terms of improved crop yields and increased water\
    \ savings\nincluding the associated reduction in energy consumption resulting\
    \ from the optimal matching of\nirrigation inputs to the spatial water demands\
    \ of the ﬁeld, thus reducing costs [11].\nPrecision irrigation is predicated on\
    \ the hypothesis that the crop water requirements vary spatially\nacross a ﬁeld.\
    \ In heterogeneous crops such as fruit orchards, this variability is also due\
    \ to physiological\nfactors such as leaf area and fruit load [144]. It is assumed\
    \ that varying water application across the ﬁeld\nto meet this spatial crop water\
    \ need will improve crop yield and reduce the costs of associated inputs.\nSmith\
    \ et al. [11] noted that the evidence to support this hypothesis in commercial\
    \ crop production is\nnot readily found in literature.\nEvans and King [18] reviewed\
    \ much of the work prior to that date focused on analysing the\nimprovements in\
    \ crop yield and water savings achievable with precision irrigation and suggested\
    \ that\nthe greatest savings are likely to occur in humid climates by the increased\
    \ utilization of stored moisture\nand in-season precipitation. Results from simulation-\
    \ and ﬁeld-based case studies they reviewed\nshowed water savings of 0% to 26%\
    \ for well-watered crop production employing precision irrigation\nstrategies.\
    \ No signiﬁcant improvements in crop yields resulting from the adoption of precision\n\
    irrigation were reported. They concluded that in arid and semi-arid regions, precision\
    \ irrigation is\nmore suited to maximize net return rather than yield and it may\
    \ have greater potential in reducing\nirrigation water use in humid climates when\
    \ irrigating to maximally utilize in-season precipitation.\nThey further noted\
    \ that the economic beneﬁt of adopting precision irrigation for ﬁeld-scale crop\n\
    production is limited. This is because the cost of equipment, maintenance and\
    \ management is much\ngreater than the revenue improvements achieved as a result\
    \ of improved yield and water savings.\nThe payback period of implementing the\
    \ technology may also exceed the useful life of the water\napplication equipment,\
    \ typically placed at 15 years. A payback period ranging from 5 to 20 years is\n\
    noted in Smith et al. [11] for the adoption of precision irrigation for crop production\
    \ in New Zealand.\nEvans et al. [145] reviewed the adoption trends of spatially\
    \ varied irrigation in the USA covering\na period of 20 years. They noted that\
    \ about only 200 of the 175,000 moving irrigation systems in the\nUSA were ﬁtted\
    \ with variable rate water application technology. They suggested higher net returns\
    \ on\ninvestment as a stimuli for adoption of precision irrigation by growers.\
    \ Growers that had adopted the\ntechnology reported no signiﬁcant savings in water\
    \ and energy use in non-limiting water situations.\nThey noted that in more than\
    \ 20 years of research pertaining to variable rate irrigation management,\nthe\
    \ economic beneﬁt was yet to be demonstrated. This was attributed to the marginal\
    \ water savings\n(5%–15%) which is insufﬁcient to realize a payback for the initial\
    \ investment in the water application\ntechnology. They concluded that an economic\
    \ strategy that optimizes net return rather than total\nreturns for the technology\
    \ should be adopted as a long-term investment goal.\nHeeren et al. [146] conducted\
    \ a simulation study to assess the reductions in pumping costs\nthrough the adoption\
    \ of precision irrigation in 49,224 centre-pivot irrigated ﬁelds in Nebraska,\
    \ USA.\nThe study focused on applying variable rate water applications in mining\
    \ undepleted available water.\nThey noted that the reduction in pumping costs\
    \ achieved from the adoption of precision irrigation\nin all ﬁelds may be negligible\
    \ in comparison to the cost of variable rate water application equipment.\nThey\
    \ concluded that the adoption of this technology will be economically justiﬁable\
    \ only with an\nincrease in energy costs.\nAn economic evaluation of spatially\
    \ varied irrigation applications is presented in Lee [147].\nThe study assessed\
    \ energy savings resulting from pumping lesser volumes of water for irrigation\
    \ on\na 67-acre ﬁeld in Wyoming. The cost of installing the variable rate water\
    \ application equipment on\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n18 of 29\nthe ﬁeld was\
    \ reported as $29,513 with a useful equipment life of 15 years. The yearly return\
    \ for the\nequipment based on energy savings achieved was computed as $1816.71,\
    \ which equates to a payback\nperiod of 16.25 years. This suggests that a payback\
    \ will only be realized for the technology outside the\nuseful life of the equipment.\n\
    Precision irrigation offers the beneﬁt of providing water conservation beneﬁts\
    \ by avoiding\noverirrigation and the associated adverse environmental impacts\
    \ [18]. Sadler et al. [148] discussed\nwater conservation strategies where precision\
    \ irrigation can potentially reduce the total water applied\nand improve the environmental\
    \ quality of irrigated ﬁelds. They suggested that programing zero\nirrigation\
    \ amounts to non-cropped areas will improve water conservation using precision\
    \ irrigation.\nThey also noted that adjusting spatial water application based\
    \ on the inﬁltration rate of the soil and\nsoil water storage capacity will reduce\
    \ the occurrence of surface runoff and soil erosion. Surface runoff\nand leaching\
    \ were identiﬁed as the major avenues for loss of nutrients from the soil. They\
    \ suggested\nthe occurrence of this can be eliminated by spatial application of\
    \ precise irrigation volumes based on\nthe soil water-holding characteristics.\
    \ They presented several case studies in which the adoption of\nprecision irrigation\
    \ has been demonstrated to enhance the environmental quality of irrigated ﬁelds.\n\
    They concluded that precision irrigation has the capability of improving water\
    \ use efﬁciencies while\nreducing the adverse environmental impacts associated\
    \ with conventional irrigation practices.\nThe results from the above studies\
    \ show that precision irrigation is a proven tool for improving\nsustainability\
    \ in irrigated agriculture in terms of enhancing environmental health. Its economic\n\
    justiﬁcation in terms of signiﬁcant yield improvements and water savings is however\
    \ limited.\nEvans and King [18] suggested that the lack of signiﬁcant improvements\
    \ in yield response when\nemploying precision irrigation may result from the fact\
    \ that the yield response to the water curve\nnear maximum yield (100% ET) is\
    \ almost ﬂat, with small changes in water applied using precision\nirrigation\
    \ having little effect on yield. The majority of these precision irrigation studies\
    \ have used only\nsoil data for irrigation management. The local microclimate\
    \ and crop genetics may however have a\ndirect inﬂuence on the yield response\
    \ of the crops.\nSoil moisture status may also not provide a complete indication\
    \ of crop water status, rather the\nplant may be the best indicator of water availability.\
    \ The decision support systems employed by\ncurrent precision irrigation systems\
    \ assume that the soil–plant–atmosphere system never varies with\ntime. The characteristics\
    \ of the crop, soil and climate vary within the season altering the timing and\n\
    optimal amount of irrigation volume required at any irrigation application event.\n\
    We argue that the incorporation of multiple sensed variables (plant, soil and\
    \ weather data) will\nenhance the possibility of arriving at optimal irrigation\
    \ decisions and hence an improvement in\neconomic outcomes. This should be integrated\
    \ with a decision support system that has the capability\nto adapt to the time-varying\
    \ nature of the cropping system. The decision support system should also\nhave\
    \ the capacity to ‘learn’ in order to improve its performance based on experience\
    \ and a target crop\nproduction function. We discuss how this can be achieved\
    \ by exploiting improvements in monitoring\nand management considerations.\n7.1.\
    \ Monitoring Considerations\nA precision irrigation system is designed to apply\
    \ water at a differential rate in response to the\ntemporal and spatial variation\
    \ in crop water need across a ﬁeld. This process is supported by a number\nof\
    \ sensors providing data to a real-time decision support system. These sensors\
    \ include weather\nstations, soil moisture sensors, environmental sensors, plant\
    \ sensors and thermal sensors which may\nbe integrated into a wireless sensor\
    \ network. A careful design of these sensing systems including a\nconsideration\
    \ of factors affecting their performance is crucial in realizing the goal of improved\
    \ water\nuse through precision irrigation.\nDielectric soil moisture sensors sense\
    \ the water content of the immediate soil in their zone\nof inﬂuence. The zone\
    \ of inﬂuence reported for most commercial dielectric soil moisture sensors\n\
    corresponds to a cylindrical measurement volume of 1.5 L [149]. It is therefore\
    \ important to install\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n19 of 29\nthe sensors in\
    \ areas representative of the soil moisture available for plant use. The normal\
    \ practice\nemployed by most users is to place the sensors in the driest regions\
    \ of the ﬁeld or in the regions\ncomprising of a soil proﬁle with the lowest available\
    \ water-holding capacity [150]. Adopting this\napproach will most likely lead\
    \ to wetter regions in the ﬁeld receiving more frequent irrigation which\nwill\
    \ consequently result in overirrigation. A more efﬁcient approach is to deﬁne\
    \ irrigation management\nzones and place a number of sensors in each management\
    \ zone to give the average soil moisture\nestimate. This may however be limited\
    \ by cost.\nA structured installation proﬁle is also necessary in order to capture\
    \ soil water movement and\navailability. It is recommended that sensors should\
    \ be installed at each soil horizon along the plant\nrooting zone [151]. An accepted\
    \ convention is the installation of sensors at three to four depths along\nthe\
    \ rooting zone (1 per 25% of total rooting depth). The sensor located on the uppermost\
    \ soil proﬁle\nis able to detect precipitation events, the sensor in the deepest\
    \ part of the proﬁle is able to detect\ndrainage and the other sensors located\
    \ midway in the soil proﬁle are able to capture soil moisture\ndynamics useful\
    \ in supporting irrigation scheduling decisions [152]. The variation in soil properties\n\
    at the different rooting depths should also be taken into account. With an increasing\
    \ knowledge of\nthe site, it is usually possible to install the sensors at two\
    \ depths and still adequately capture the soil\nmoisture dynamics. The soil moisture\
    \ sensors should also be deployed using soil-speciﬁc calibration\nequations to\
    \ enable accurate estimates of soil moisture content.\nThe actual crop evapotranspiration\
    \ can vary spatially and temporally under conditions of\nunrestricted water supply.\
    \ These variations can be the result of several factors including differences\n\
    in crop genetics, plant density, weed competition, pest intensity, nutrient availability\
    \ and stage of\ngrowth [18]. Addressing the variation in ET across a ﬁeld may\
    \ result in signiﬁcant water savings.\nThe accurate measurement of evapotranspiration\
    \ is crucial in arriving at optimal irrigation\ndecisions [71]. The FAO-PM procedure\
    \ for calculating ET which is applied in many precision irrigation\nsystems relies\
    \ on information from weather stations applied in calculating a reference ET which\
    \ is\nadjusted for speciﬁc crops using crop coefﬁcients. This calculated ET is\
    \ assumed to be uniform for every\npart of the ﬁeld. This will however result\
    \ in the application of inaccurate irrigation volumes to replace\ncrop water use,\
    \ owing to the spatial nature of the actual ET. The application of the NDVI technique\n\
    in determining site-speciﬁc crop coefﬁcients provides a platform for overcoming\
    \ this challenge.\nThe surface renewal analysis procedure also presents a promising\
    \ tool for quantifying the actual\ncrop ET. It is however best suited to homogeneous,\
    \ short and dense canopies.\nPlant-based measurements provide the best indication\
    \ of plant water status as they provide a direct\nmeasure of the plants’ response\
    \ to soil moisture availability and climatic demand. An efficient plant-based\n\
    monitoring system should however respond sensitively to the slightest change in\
    \ water deficits.\nMeasurements of leaf water potential and sap ﬂow are contact\
    \ methods which give direct\ninformation on plant water status but their spatial\
    \ resolution is limited as many samples are required\nto effectively monitor the\
    \ dynamics of ﬁeld-scale plant water status [153]. Infrared thermometry has\n\
    provided a robust platform for assessing plant water status. The (CWSI calculated\
    \ from the infrared\nmeasurements of crop canopy temperature can adequately quantify\
    \ ﬁeld-scale crop water status with\nhigh spatial and temporal resolution. This\
    \ presents a robust and cost-effective tool for use in precision\nirrigation.\
    \ Its application in humid regions is however marred with difﬁculties.\nA systems\
    \ engineering approach can be applied in overcoming the difficulties encountered\
    \ with\napplying the CWSI in humid climates. A mathematical model derived using\
    \ this approach may adequately\nsimulate the real-time dynamics of the baseline\
    \ temperatures required for computing the index.\nA summary of the technology\
    \ gaps and reﬁnements necessary in monitoring tools in order to\nachieve robust\
    \ precision irrigation management is presented in [11]. They include the limited\
    \ volume\nof inﬂuence, high cost and the need to improve the measurement accuracy\
    \ of soil moisture sensors.\nThe reﬁnements recommended include the development\
    \ of low cost soil measurement sensors with\na wider volume of inﬂuence, low cost\
    \ and resilient wireless communication networks able to link\nspatially deployed\
    \ soil moisture sensors and the development of smart calibration software in order\n\
    Sustainability 2017, 9, 353\n20 of 29\nto improve the accuracy of soil moisture\
    \ sensors. The technology gaps identiﬁed in plant sensing\ntechnology include\
    \ the limited knowledge of irrigation thresholds and quantity, and low spatial\n\
    resolution. The reﬁnements recommended include the integration of plant-based\
    \ sensing with soil\nmoisture sensing tools in order to determine irrigation volumes,\
    \ calibration of infra-red thermography\nagainst physiologically explicit plant\
    \ measurements in order to determine critical thresholds and the\ndeployment of\
    \ IR thermography tools on low altitude UAVs to further enhance spatial coverage.\n\
    A combination of multiple sensor inputs deployed at a density that captures spatial\
    \ variability\nis therefore likely to yield the most robust and accurate solution\
    \ for precision irrigation. This will\nensure that the decision support system\
    \ is robust to data availability, gaps and deﬁciencies. This will\ninclude data\
    \ from soil, weather and plant sensors [11]. An important consideration will also\
    \ include\ndeveloping cost-effective and user-friendly tools which will enhance\
    \ the adoption of these adaptive\nsystems by farmers.\n7.2. Management Considerations\n\
    Management can perhaps be viewed as the most vital aspect of a precision irrigation\
    \ system.\nManagement acts as an interface between monitoring and decision support,\
    \ culminating into irrigation\ndecisions. This enables the implementation of vital\
    \ management decisions of when and where to\napply irrigation and also the irrigation\
    \ volumes to be applied. The decision support system is perhaps\nthe management\
    \ backbone of a precision irrigation system and its proper implementation is vital\
    \ for\nimproving sustainability in irrigated agriculture.\nThe adaptive decision\
    \ support tools discussed have the capability of improving crop yield and\nwater\
    \ savings when deployed as part of a precision irrigation system. Smith et al.\
    \ [11] noted that\nthe simulation of adaptive decision support strategies can\
    \ be used in identifying optimal irrigation\nscheduling decisions. A simulation\
    \ tool capable of representing a range of ﬁeld conditions at different\nspatial\
    \ and temporal scales is considered ideal. Such a simulation framework is presented\
    \ in [114].\nModel-based decision support systems using feedback from multiple\
    \ sensors may present a\nplatform for arriving at optimal water applications.\
    \ MPC appears to be ideally suited for achieving the\naim of improving sustainability\
    \ in irrigated agriculture. A decision support system based on MPC\nemploys an\
    \ optimization algorithm to implement an input strategy with the best performance.\n\
    McCarthy et al. [113] noted that MPC implemented for a precision irrigation system\
    \ could involve\nthe use of real-time data from ﬁeld sensors to calibrate a crop\
    \ or soil model and then optimizing this\ncalibrated model to arrive at optimal\
    \ irrigation scheduling decisions. A combination of data from soil\nmoisture sensors,\
    \ thermal sensors and weather sensors would be appropriate for MPC. The data from\n\
    the sensors would most likely be required daily, as measurements are not required\
    \ at a high temporal\nresolution to calibrate the model. A dense deployment of\
    \ these sensors is however required to account\nfor the spatial nature of ﬁeld-scale\
    \ crop water use. The thermal sensors may be mounted on a moving\nplatform for\
    \ spatial data collection across the ﬁeld.\nEquipment availability, irrigation\
    \ system capacity and other operational considerations can be\nincorporated as\
    \ system-level constraints in an MPC-based decision support system. These constraints\n\
    can be considered to arrive at future irrigation scheduling decisions [113].\n\
    MPC uses a model’s simulation to determine the optimum irrigation application\
    \ timing and\nvolume. When combined with a soft sensing system, variables that\
    \ are not directly measured can be\ncontrolled and optimized. This presents a\
    \ possibility of applying decision support systems based on\nMPC in realising\
    \ a desired crop yield and also a water-saving goal [136].\nThere has been considerable\
    \ research into water use procedures that can achieve improved water\nsavings\
    \ in irrigated agriculture, particularly deﬁcit irrigation. Deﬁcit irrigation\
    \ (DI) is an irrigation\nstrategy in which a crop is exposed to a level of water\
    \ stress at certain growth stages in its development\n(regulated deﬁcit irrigation)\
    \ or throughout its growth season. The growth stage in which the plant is\nsubjected\
    \ to water stress is predetermined as a drought tolerant stage. The goal of deﬁcit\
    \ irrigation is\nthat there will be little adverse effect on yield and irrigation\
    \ water can be conserved [154]. Evans and\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n21 of\
    \ 29\nKing [18] suggested deﬁcit irrigation as a tool for improving water use\
    \ in precision irrigation. They\nnoted that it can be applied in maximizing net\
    \ returns and conserve large amounts of water in arid\nand semi-arid regions.\n\
    It is however important to investigate the response of different crops to water\
    \ deﬁcits including\ntiming tolerances in order to develop optimal deﬁcit irrigation\
    \ strategies that can be integrated into\nthe precision irrigation decision support\
    \ framework. It is also important to investigate the economics\nof yield reduction\
    \ associated with deﬁcit irrigation strategies. O’Shaughnessy et al. [33] suggested\
    \ that\nimplementing deﬁcit irrigation as part of precision irrigation management\
    \ will involve the continuous\nassessment of crop stress and growth stage throughout\
    \ the growing season. This will be instrumental in\navoiding temporary severe\
    \ stress which could result in uneconomic reduction in crop yield or quality.\n\
    The high cost of the component technologies of precision irrigation including\
    \ soil, plant and\nweather sensors, decision support systems and variable rate\
    \ water application systems is presently\na constraint to the wide-scale adoption\
    \ of this technology by farmers [148]. The minimal yield\nimprovements and water\
    \ savings currently achieved through ﬁeld-scale precision irrigation may\nnot\
    \ justify the initial capital investment required for its adoption. As fresh water\
    \ resources become\nscarcer, it is expected that more premium will be placed on\
    \ water abstracted for irrigated agriculture.\nRegulatory agencies may also require\
    \ farmers to continuously demonstrate the efﬁcient use of water.\nThese factors\
    \ may promote the adoption of precision irrigation by farmers [155].\nA conceptual\
    \ model-based decision support system that uses the full range of plant, weather\
    \ and\nsoil data for irrigation management is illustrated in Figure 1. This is\
    \ currently being developed by the\nauthors. It involves the integration of various\
    \ sensing systems, dynamic modeling, machine learning\nand model predictive control\
    \ into an adaptive decision support system for precision irrigation.\nSustainability\

    \ including soil, plant and \nweather sensors, decision support systems and variable\

    Technological innovations that can improve sustainability in irrigated agriculture\
    \ form an\nimportant vehicle for actualizing the optimal use of limited water\
    \ resources. Precision irrigation\nhas been demonstrated as such an innovation,\
    \ though presently the economic beneﬁt related to\nthe adoption of this technology\
    \ at ﬁeld-scale crop production is minimal.\nThis is because the\npotential for\
    \ yield improvements and water savings may not cover the cost of technology required\
    \ for\nits implementation.\nThe application of adaptive control techniques to\
    \ irrigation decision support and improvements\nin monitoring tools has the capability\
    \ of dealing with the time-varying and stochastic nature of the\nsoil–plant–atmosphere\
    \ system while also considering operational limitations in arriving at optimal\n\
    irrigation decisions. This ultimately presents a platform for actualizing the\
    \ environmental and\neconomic goals of sustainability in irrigated agriculture.\n\
    A robust design of monitoring tools including a proper combination of soil, weather\
    \ and plant\nsensors is however vital for the proper operation of an adaptive\
    \ decision support system. The decision\nsupport system should be able to account\
    \ for the varying crop water requirements within season as a\nresult of both biotic\
    \ and abiotic factors. The decision support system should also consider agronomic\n\
    objectives to ensure the optimal irrigation strategy is delivered by the precision\
    \ irrigation system.\nThe high cost of sensors and the requirement for dense deployment\
    \ in order to obtain data at\nhigh spatial resolutions is presently a constraint.\
    \ The large dataset required for the calibration of crop\nsimulation models is\
    \ also another signiﬁcant problem. Future research needs include the development\n\
    of cost-effective soil moisture sensors with wider spheres of inﬂuence, identiﬁcation\
    \ of irrigation\nthresholds for plant-based sensors and the development of self-learning\
    \ crop simulation models that\nare able to infer relationships from a limited\
    \ data set. The ﬁeld evaluation of adaptive decision support\nsystems would also\
    \ be beneﬁcial in quantifying their sustainability improvement potential.\nAcknowledgments:\

  relevance_evaluation:
    extract_1: A precision irrigation system is designed to apply water at a differential
      rate in response to the temporal and spatial variation in crop water need across
      a ﬁeld. This process is supported by a number of sensors providing data to a
      real-time decision support system. These sensors include weather stations, soil
      moisture sensors, environmental sensors, plant sensors and thermal sensors which
      may be integrated into a wireless sensor network.
    extract_2: A combination of multiple sensor inputs deployed at a density that
      captures spatial variability is therefore likely to yield the most robust and
      accurate solution for precision irrigation.

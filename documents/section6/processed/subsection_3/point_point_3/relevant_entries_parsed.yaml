    agriculture technologies, such as yield monitors, variable-rate application equipment,
    and automated irrigation systems. These devices collect data on soil moisture
    levels, temperature, and other environmental factors that can be used to make
    informed decisions about irrigation scheduling and other crop management practices.
    Soil moisture sensors can also be used to monitor water usage and identify areas
    of the field that are not getting enough water.


    Soil moisture sensors are typically installed underground, and they measure the
    soil moisture content using a variety of methods, such as capacitance, resistance,
    or tensiometry. Weather stations measure temperature, humidity, wind speed, and
    other environmental factors that can impact crop growth and development.


    The data collected from soil moisture sensors and weather stations can be used
    to create irrigation schedules that are tailored to the specific needs of the
    crop and the field conditions. This can help to reduce water usage and improve
    crop yields.


    In addition to soil moisture sensors and weather stations, other precision agriculture
    technologies that can be integrated with other precision agriculture technologies
    include:


    * **Yield monitors:** Collect data on crop yield during harvest, which can be
    used to create yield maps that identify areas of the field that are more or less

    * **Variable-rate application equipment:** Can apply inputs, such as fertilizer
    or pesticides, at different rates across the field based on the data collected
    from soil moisture sensors, yield monitors, and other precision agriculture technologies.

    * **Automated irrigation systems:** Can be used to control irrigation based on
    the data collected from soil moisture sensors and weather stations.


    By integrating these different precision agriculture technologies, farmers can
    create a complete system that can help them to improve crop yields, reduce water
    usage, and optimize their overall farming operation.'

    with existing irrigation infrastructure to achieve automated and real-time monitoring
    of environmental parameters in an agricultural environment. The aim is to apply
    smart actions for precision agriculture, leading to improved crop productivity
    and resource conservation.


    The paper begins by highlighting the importance of environmental monitoring and
    how traditional methods have limitations in terms of accuracy, timeliness, and
    cost-effectiveness. It then introduces the use of IoT sensors and drones as a
    solution to these limitations.


    The authors propose a low-cost platform that integrates IoT sensors with a drone
    for comprehensive environmental parameter monitoring. The platform consists of:


    1. IoT sensors deployed in the field to collect data on temperature, humidity,
    soil moisture, rain level, and solar radiation.

    2. A drone equipped with a LoRa module to collect data from the IoT sensors and
    transmit it to the cloud.

    3. A cloud-based platform for data storage, analysis, and visualization.


    The proposed platform offers several advantages over traditional monitoring methods,
    including:


    1. Automated and real-time data collection, reducing the need for manual labor
    and improving accuracy.

    2. Wider coverage area due to the use of a drone, allowing for monitoring of large
    agricultural fields.

    3. Cost-effectiveness, as the platform leverages low-cost IoT sensors and open-source
    software.


    The paper also provides experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness
    of the proposed platform. The results show that the platform can accurately monitor
    environmental parameters and provide valuable insights for farmers to make informed
    decisions. For example, farmers can use the data to:


    1. Optimize irrigation schedules based on soil moisture levels.

    2. Adjust fertilizer application based on soil nutrient levels.

    (Baggio 2005; Garcia-Sanchez et al. 2011; Shaikh et al. 2010; Vellidis et al.
    2008). The lifetime of a WSN depends on the power source required by the nodes.

  extract_1: Smart Agriculture presently lacks an Internet of Things (IoT) platform
    for the gathering, preprocessing, and storage of data used in irrigation management,
    which also allows for the reuse of code to different sets of crops, soil, irrigation
    system, and weather data sources. In this paper, we have proposed the Smart&Green
    IoT framework which executes an irrigation management plan using the water balance
    and potential matric approaches according to the crop, as well as irrigation system
    information provided by users and the weather and soil moisture data available
    close to the monitored fields. Smart&Green can be used to preprocess soil moisture
    data with outlier removal criteria and techniques of Zscore, MZscore, GESD, and
    Chauvenet to provide a more precise irrigation water need (IWN) in irrigation
    management.
  extract_2: 'Furthermore, we have designed a module to support irrigation management
    with our prediction models, based on GBRT. We evaluated irrigation management
    using the water balance and matric potential approaches with real and predicted
    data of soil moisture, as well as the impact of preprocessing data with outlier
    removal techniques. The real data was part of a data set collected from an experimental
    field for research in the city of Paraipaba, Brazil, in which cashews and other
    raw materials were grown.


    We also report that the dataset will be made publicly available to ensure the
    reproducibility of our results and promote research developments in this field
    (see Supplementary Materials).'

    moisture, matric potential, plant water status, air temperature, relative humidity,
    and vapor pressure deficit. The network was designed to provide reliable and real-time

    The ultimate irrigation potential of India has been estimated to be 139.5 million
    ha, comprising 58.5 million ha from major and medium schemes, 15 million ha from
    minor irrigation schemes, 66 million ha from groundwater exploitation, and an
    estimated 77 million ha beyond 2025 from freshwater use for irrigation [6]. It
    is approximated that after gaining the full potential of the irrigation, nearly
    50% of the total cultivated area will hold out rain-fed. Irrigation is the most
    important factor for escalating the agricultural production of plants. It is essential
    to determine the quantity of water to get the optimal benefits from the irrigation,
    which depends on some factors such as the environment, type of crop, subsurface
    geo-hydrological condition, and the stage of its growth. The questions arise in
    the irrigation scheduling are as follows: (i) How to apply irrigation water?,
    (ii) How much to irrigate? Currently, irrigation decision-making systems are enforced
    to the agricultural field aiming for specific crop at a given area [7]. It is
    difficult to be practiced to different crops and areas. Under the growing environment,
    the amount of irrigation is defined as the depth of water required to meet the
    crop water loss through evapotranspiration. It can be obtained via prediction
    using indirect channels, or field measurement techniques. However, the amount
    and timing of water have major impact on quality of crop and its yield. Several
    methods are applied for the irrigation scheduling such as pan evaporation, soil
    moisture basis, leaf water potential, and based on growth-stages.'

    has reached maximum; Plants cover the ground optimally; probably they began to
    flowering or developing to set grain; The water demand is greatest when the crop
    is fully cultivated.

    Their water needs are called the “peak period”. The type of crop that has also
    affected the total growing duration of crop development is known by seasonal crop
    water need and can be obtained. The best possible local data can be obtained on

    systems. The paper also highlights the limitations and challenges of IoT-based
    smart farming and proposes solutions and best practices to overcome them.


    The specific point you have highlighted, which is the concern that smart farming
    systems becoming increasingly more complex and expensive, is addressed in the
    "Barriers to Implementing Smart Farming Technologies" section of the paper. The
    authors acknowledge that the cost of technology, lack of financial resources,
    literacy status of farmers, lack of integration between systems, and telecommunications
    infrastructure are all barriers to the widespread adoption of smart farming technologies.
    They propose solutions such as developing low-cost IoT devices, providing financial
    support to farmers, increasing farmer literacy through education and training,
    improving system integration, and expanding telecommunications infrastructure
    to rural areas.


    Additionally, the paper emphasizes the importance of interoperability and standardization
    in smart farming systems to ensure that different components can communicate and

  extract_1: Smart farming is a development that has emphasized information and communication
    technology used in machinery, equipment, and sensors in network-based hi-tech
    farm supervision cycles. Innovative technologies, the Internet of Things (IoT),
    and cloud computing are anticipated to inspire growth and initiate the use of
    robots and artiﬁcial intelligence in farming. Such ground-breaking deviations
    are unsettling current agriculture approaches, while also presenting a range of
    challenges. This paper investigates the tools and equipment used in applications
    of wireless sensors in IoT agriculture, and the anticipated challenges faced when
    merging technology with conventional farming activities. Furthermore, this technical
    knowledge is helpful to growers during crop periods from sowing to harvest; and
    applications in both packing and transport are also investigated.
  extract_2: The timely use of sensors has made the entire farming operation smart
    and cost-effective, due to precise monitoring. The various autonomous harvesters,
    robotic weeders, and drones have sensors attached to collect data over short intervals.
    However, the vastness of agriculture puts extreme demands on technological solutions
    for sustainability with minimum ecological impact. Sensor technology through wireless
    communication helps farmers to know the various needs and requirements of crops
    without being in the ﬁelds, and they are then able to take remote action [11].

    Soil water balance models for determining crop water and irrigation requirements

  explanation: The researcher and their team conducted an extensive literature review
    in order to evaluate the current state of automated, real-time irrigation management
    systems, particularly those that incorporate the FAO56 method. They identify the
    strengths and weaknesses of this approach, particularly with respect to the partitioning
    of reference evapotranspiration into crop transpiration and soil evaporation components,
    and discuss how this affects developing irrigation schedules. They propose solutions
    and best practices based on the analysis of case studies and real-world implementations.
  extract_1: '"The advantage of transient state models is that soil water processes
    can be accurately described mechanistically, e.g. infiltration and water redistribution,
    root water uptake, deep percolation and capillary rise. However, the inputs of
    soil hydraulic properties, such as the soil water retention and permeability curves
    (respectively θ(h) and K(h) curves), are much more exigent than for simpler SWB
    models in terms of data acquisition and θ(h) and K(h) calibration. Often, the
    inverse model simulation needs to be adopted for their calibration before application.
    In addition, the vegetation parameters needed are much more complex than for FAO56-based
    SWB models. Therefore, these models are hard to parameterize and calibrate resulting
    more suitable for agronomic and irrigation research, and when assessing nitrates,
    chemicals and salinity dynamics in relation to crop growth and yield."'
  extract_2: Combined with predicted or assessed crop and irrigation management practices,
    the DSSAT-CSM models recently adopted the FAO56 Kcb-ETo approach (DeJonge and
    Thorp, 2017), namely the grass reference ETo and the FAO56 dual Kc approach. By
    recently adopting the FAO56 Kcb-ETo approach (Thorp et al., 2017), their use for
    assessing irrigation management options resulted easier to interpret.

    \ environments by utilizing various technologies such as multispectral imaging,\
    \ thermal imaging, Lidar, GPS, and machine learning and artificial intelligence\
    \ algorithms. These technologies allow UAVs to collect data on crop health, growth,\
    \ and yield potential, which can be used to make informed decisions on crop management\
    \ practices and optimize inputs like fertilizers and pesticides, reducing costs\
    \ and environmental impact.\n\n4. **What types of data can be obtained through\
    \ the use of UAVs?**\nUAVs can capture various types of data, including visual\
    \ imagery using cameras, LiDAR data, GPS data, and environmental data such as\
    \ temperature, humidity, and air quality. This data can be used for various applications\

    \ endangering other aircraft or public safety. Furthermore, the automation and\
    \ autonomy of drones raise questions about accountability and liability in case\
    \ of accidents or damage caused by these devices. To address these issues, several\
    \ measures can be implemented. Firstly, clear regulations and guidelines should\
    \ be established regarding the operation of drones in agricultural settings. These\
    \ regulations should address aspects such as flight restrictions, licensing requirements,\
    \ and privacy protection. Adequate enforcement mechanisms should be in place to\
    \ ensure compliance.\nSecondly, public awareness campaigns and education initiatives\
    \ can inform both farmers and the general public about the responsible and legal\
    \ use of drones in agriculture. This can help foster understanding and mitigate\
    \ privacy concerns. Additionally, technological solutions can be developed to\
    \ enhance privacy protection, such as implementing geofencing mechanisms that\
    \ restrict drone access to certain areas or utilizing data anonymization techniques.\
    \ Collaboration between stakeholders, including farmers, drone operators, regulatory\
    \ bodies, and legal experts, is crucial for developing comprehensive guidelines\
    \ and frameworks that address the ethical and legal implications of drone use\
    \ in agriculture. Regular review and updates of regulations can also ensure they\

  explanation: The paper discusses the importance of using automated systems for real-time
    monitoring in food processing. Such systems can help with ensuring food quality
    and safety and also reducing food waste, which became an even more prevalent issue
    during the COVID-19 pandemic. Examples of these automated systems are IoT (Internet
    of Things) sensors and blockchain technology.
  extract_1: The COVID-19 pandemic and its socio-economic consequences have had direct
    implications for food sectors, primarily aﬀecting food safety, food security,
    and food sustainability (Knorr and Augustin, 2021; Rahaman et al., 2021). The
    rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic has pushed many governments to impose lockdowns
    and severe restrictions of human movements that have led to labor shortages, including
    the food supply chain, disrupting the relatively seamless ﬂow of raw materials
    in agriculture, food, and beverage industries.
  extract_2: The pandemic has accentuated the pressing need for technological innovations
    and highlighted the importance of implementing new solutions to reduce human-to-human
    and human-to-food contact (Chitrakar et al., 2021). Many innovative strategies,
    such as smart monitoring technologies and smart detection systems have been developed
    and suggested as possible solutions to mitigate the negative consequences of the
    pandemic and to enhance food quality and safety (Chitrakar et al., 2021; Alabi
    and Ngwenyama, 2022). The role of packaging has been a focus, particularly with
    the recent development of nanocarriers that can be used as part of active packaging
    to increase shelf life and maintain food quality during food transportation (Pascuta
    and Vodnar, 2022).

      resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that
      can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service
      provider interaction, according to the National Institute of Standards and Technologies
      (NIST) [28]. The datacenter (hardware), infrastructure, platform, and application
      layers make up the primary architecture of CC [29]. Each of these layers corresponds
      to one of three cloud service models: SaaS (software as a service), PaaS (platform
      as a service), and IaaS (infrastructure as a service) (IaaS). In the agriculture
      sector, cloud computing has gotten a lot of attention in the last decade because
      it provides: 1) low-cost storage for data collected from various domains via
      WSNs and other preconfigured IoT devices, 2) large-scale computer systems to
      make intelligent decisions by converting raw data into usable knowledge, and
      3) a secure platform for developing agricultural based IoT applications [30].'
    extract_2: Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a network of interconnected computing
      devices, sensors, appliances, and machines that are all connected to the internet
      and have their own unique identities and capacities for remote sensing and monitoring
      [21]. Network layer (communication), perception layer (hardware devices), ,
      middleware layer (device management and interoperability), service layer (cloud
      computing), application layer (data integration and analytics), and end-user
      layer are the six layers of the IoT reference architecture (user-inter-face).
      IoT devices on the physical layer in the agricultural domain collect data on
      environmental and crop characteristics such as temperature, humidity, pH value,
      water level, leaf colour, fresh leaf weight, and so on. The network layer is
      responsible for transmitting this information, and its architecture is determined
      by the field size, farm location, and type of farming method. ZigBee, LoRa,
      and Sigfox, for example, are widely utilized and employed in outdoor fields
      because they are less expensive, have low energy consumption, and have a long
      trans-mission range [22, 23]. Bluetooth, despite being a secure technology,
      is only employed in indoor farms due to its limited transmission range [22].
      Due to its high costs and high energy consumption, Wi-Fi is not a promising
      technology for agricultural applications [22]. On the other hand, RFID (radio
      frequency identification) and NFC (near field communication) technologies are

  explanation: 'The paper titled “From Smart Farming towards Unmanned Farms: A New
    Mode of Agricultural Production” suggests a new agricultural production mode called
    unmanned farms. Unlike smart farming systems, which still require human intervention,
    unmanned farms fully automate the entire agricultural process using advanced technologies
    such as the Internet of Things (IoT), big data, artificial intelligence (AI),
    fifth-generation (5G) communication technology, and robots, eliminating the need
    for manual labor.


    In this context, cloud-based platforms for intelligent decision-making play a
    critical role in unmanned farms. By integrating sensor data, these platforms leverage
    big data and AI technologies to analyze and process vast amounts of information.
    Based on these analyses, they make critical production and operation decisions,
    such as crop management, livestock monitoring, and equipment control.


    One specific example of how AI is used in unmanned farms is in the analysis of
    physiological characteristics of animals and plants, which enables more accurate
    data-driven decision-making. For instance, AI algorithms can be employed to determine
    optimal environmental conditions and nutritional requirements based on data collected
    from sensors monitoring animal health, growth rate, and feed intake. This information
    helps farmers optimize production processes and ensure animal welfare.


    Furthermore, AI-powered computer vision technologies are used for species classification,
    crop disease recognition, and behavior analysis. These capabilities allow unmanned
    farms to monitor crop health, detect pests and diseases, and optimize irrigation
    schedules, leading to increased yields and reduced environmental impact.


    In summary, cloud-based platforms for intelligent decision-making are essential
    for realizing the full potential of unmanned farms. By leveraging big data and
    AI technologies, these platforms empower farmers with data-driven insights and
    automated decision-making capabilities, ultimately contributing to more efficient

    and derive a predictor for the a posteriori probability of the crop coefficient
    over time. The model is implemented in the cloud server of an IoT network, which

    Sensors, 22(15), 5646.
  explanation: This paper introduces an IoT-based monitoring system designed for aeroponic
    greenhouse environments. An aeroponic system is a vertical cultivation method
    where the roots of plants are suspended in a nutrient-rich mist. One of the key
    challenges in aeroponics is determining the optimal atomization time and timing
    interval for irrigation based on the specific needs of each plant. The proposed
    system collects data from various sensors, including temperature and humidity,
    both in the greenhouse and on the plants themselves. It also incorporates image
    processing techniques to analyze the appearance of roots and leaves. All the collected
    data is processed and analyzed using edge computing, fog computing, and cloud
    computing, providing real-time insights into the growth conditions of the plants
    and the overall efficiency of the aeroponic system. By integrating various sensing
    and computing technologies, this system aims to improve crop yield and reduce
    water usage.

  explanation: 'Blockchain technology is a distributed ledger system that allows for
    secure and tamper-proof recording of transactions across multiple parties. It
    has been gaining prominence in supply chain management due to its potential to
    enhance transparency, efficiency, and traceability. A recent study conducted by
    researchers at Maher A. N. Agi and Ashish Kumar Jha sought to identify and evaluate
    the enablers of blockchain technology adoption in supply chains. Drawing upon
    an extensive literature review and theoretical lenses from the Diffusion of Innovation
    and Business Technology Adoption Model developed by Iacovou, Benbasat, and Dexter
    (1995), the study identified 20 enablers of blockchain adoption in supply chains,
    which were then assessed using the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory
    (DEMATEL) method to determine their relative importance and interrelationships.


    The study''s findings revealed that both external pressure and relative advantage
    are the two most prominent categories of enablers that impact blockchain adoption
    in supply chains. Within these categories, specific enablers such as customer
    interest in the traceability and other product-related data on blockchain (E17),
    establishing regulatory frameworks for using blockchain technology (E19), and
    lowering transaction costs (E7) emerged as the most influential factors driving
    blockchain adoption.


    Furthermore, the study also highlighted the importance of cooperation and collaboration
    among supply chain partners to foster blockchain adoption. Enablers related to
    cooperation, such as establishing appropriate and clear governance rules for blockchain
    platforms (E15), cooperating for process standardization (E12), and developing
    common supply chain objectives from using the technology (E13), were found to
    be significant enablers of blockchain adoption.


    Overall, this study provides insights into the key factors and drivers that influence
    the adoption of blockchain technology in supply chains. Understanding these enablers
    is crucial for companies and supply chain managers seeking to leverage the benefits
    of blockchain technology to enhance their supply chain operations and gain a competitive
    advantage.'
  extract_1: Lower transaction cost (E7), customer interest in the traceability information
    and other product-related data on blockchain (E17), management commitment (E4),
    establishing regulatory framework for using blockchain technology (E19) and cooperation
    between supply chain members for process standardization and agreement on the
    type and level of details of the data to be shared on the blockchain (E12), respectively.
  extract_2: Our results also show that establishing regulatory framework for using
    blockchain technology (E19) is an important cause enabler ranked fourth in prominence.

    automation across the entire pipeline. The study''s findings provide valuable
    insights into the key factors that influence the adoption of blockchain technology
    in supply chains, which is essential for understanding how automation can be effectively
    integrated into supply chain management using blockchain technology.'

    integrityFood safetySmart farming 1. Introduction The world''s population is expected
    to reach 8.5 billion by 2030 and 9.7 billion by 2050 [1]. Providing food at an
    appropriate time, in the right quantity and quality to an ever-increasing population
    places a significant strain on the global food supply chain (FSC), exacerbated
    by challenges pertaining to food quality, food safety, food wastage, food price
    volatility, deforestation, and carbon emissions. In addition, product origin traceability,
    FSC transparency, and smart farming safety are also key challenges that affect
    an FSC [2]. An FSC comprises five key players: producer, processor, distributor,
    retailer, and consumer (Fig. 1). It is responsible for the transmission of food
    from producers to consumers. A traditional FSC is a system with a centralized,
    monopolistic, and asymmetric structure. As a result, food products cannot be traced
    within an FSC, leading to food fraud, data tampering, and counterfeit information.

    Fig. 1. Food supply chain. Haber and Storneta introduced blockchain in 1991 [3].
    In a white paper published a decade ago, a mysterious individual, or possibly
    a group, known as Satoshi Nakamoto, defined Bitcoin as a blockchain-based solution
    to the double-spending problem [4]. Bitcoin utilizes blockchain to enable secure
    financial transactions without the need for a trusted central authority, like
    banks and financial institutions. Blockchain ensures that the history of a digital
    asset is immutable and transparent through the use of decentralization and cryptographic
    hashing. Data integrity, decentralization, and high reliability are all features
    of blockchain. In recent years, smart technologies, such as blockchain, have emerged
    as a basic approach adopted in many sectors, including agri-food 4.0 [5], healthcare
    [6,7], energy [8], environment [9], aquaculture [10], and banking [11]. Blockchain-based
    traceability systems use a consensus process within FSC entities to store transaction
    data on blockchains throughout transportation so that customers can examine all
    information and verify products'' authenticity. Further, blockchain provides an
    immutable record of transactions with smart contracts, which may help in improving
    food safety and quality [[12], [13], [14]]. Additionally, blockchain''s integration
    with other smart technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Radio Frequency
    Identification (RFID), and Near Field Communication (NFC) sensors, supports transparency,
    traceability, and data privacy and reduces the number of incorrect data entries
    [[15], [16], [17]]. Researchers have reviewed the implementation of blockchain
    in FSCs through different perspectives. • The author in Ref. [18] compared traditional
    traceability systems in the food industry to blockchain-based traceability systems.
    • In Refs. [19,20], and [21], the authors conducted a literature review on blockchain
    applications for traceability in the Agri Food Supply Chain (AFSC) area and explored
    the challenges and benefits. • The authors in Ref. [22] analyzed the literature
    to determine what level of analytics were used (descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive),
    what sustainable agriculture supply chain (ASC) goals were met (social, environmental,
    and economic), and what supply chain data collection processes and resources were
    used. • The authors in Ref. [23] conducted a word map analysis of scholarly papers
    linked to food traceability. According to this survey, the majority of work is
    focused on food quality and safety technology. Moreover [24], provided a bibliometric
    analysis of documents related to blockchain in the food and agriculture industry.
    • A systematic literature review of research articles related to drivers and barriers
    for blockchain adoption was conducted in Ref. [25]. Additionally, a novel framework
    was proposed, and future research scope was discussed. • The systematic literature
    review in Ref. [26] addressed the application of blockchain in the sector of plant
    food safety, animal food safety, and processed food safety. • The authors in Ref.
    [27] conducted a literature assessment on blockchain''s uses in AFSCs to achieve
    sustainability and provide future directions for addressing the field''s current
    issues. • The researchers in Ref. [28] discussed food sector issues, such as food
    safety and security, bioactive food compounds, and sustainability during the COVID-19
    pandemic, and discussed innovative ideas to make a radical change in this sector
    during the lockdown period and post COVID-19 era. • The researchers in Ref. [29]
    examined the usage of blockchain in agriculture and addressed current strategies
    to promote its adoption in this area. An illustration, namely the blockchain application
    and future development plans for COVID-19 global food crises, was used to validate
    the effective use of blockchain in this industry. • The authors in Ref. [30] discussed
    the importance of integrating IoT and blockchain. They also presented a novel
    blockchain-based methodology to address the major difficulties in precision agriculture
    using IoT. To the best of the authors’ understanding, previous literature has
    not explored much the effects of blockchain in FSCs around the world. The authors
    could find only a limited number of articles on the implementation of blockchain
    in FSCs in the Scopus database. It was observed that in the published literature,
    no study has covered or listed the various applications of blockchain in FSCs,
    addressed current hurdles, or discussed potential solutions in a single article.
    To fill this gap, this review article intends to provide a comprehensive literature
    review and a bibliometric analysis of blockchain in FSCs. The present study focuses
    on the following aspects: • Applications of blockchain in FSCs. • Challenges associated
    with the application of blockchain in FSCs. • Potential solutions and methodologies
    that may be adopted for the successful implementation of blockchain in FSCs. •
    Future research directions. • Bibliometric analysis to analyze the current research
    trends. Based on the abovementioned aspects, the authors have tried to identify
    the answers to the three primary research questions (RQs) given below: RQ1. How
    can blockchain address the present scenario where an ever-increasing global population
    is placing an immense burden on FSCs? RQ2. What are the major challenges for the
    implementation of blockchain in FSCs and what can be the potential solutions?
    RQ3. What are the recent study trends in the field of blockchain in FSCs? This
    paper is organized as follows. The basic concept of blockchain is presented in
    Section 2. The review''s research approach is discussed in Section 3. A complete
    literature review is presented in Section 4. Section 5 discusses the bibliometric
    analysis. The discussion related to the present article is given in Section 6.
    Section 7 provides concluding remarks, limitations, and future scope. 2. Blockchain
    technology Blockchain is a shared, immutable, and a distributed ledger of information
    that keeps a record of transactions. It is a peer-to-peer network in which nodes
    from different networks are connected but do not trust each other. The ledger
    of each node keeps a track of transactions and ensures that they are always synchronized.
    Data integrity, decentralization, and high reliability are the prime features
    of blockchain. An added advantage is that it does not rely on a third party for
    communication and transaction between nodes. The general structure of blockchain
    is depicted through Fig. 2. The verified data are kept in a chain of hash-linked
    blocks in a sequential order. Download : Download high-res image (400KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 2. General structure of blockchain. The blocks
    are updated into a chain-like system after verification by a certain node chosen
    through an agreed-upon consensus procedure. The database of a blockchain is not
    just an array; it is a ledger that contains all prior transactions for all the
    entities in a blockchain network and has distinguished features, like decentralized
    control, low latency, high throughput, tamper-proof data storage, and built-in
    security. 2.1. Types of blockchains As illustrated in Fig. 3, a blockchain''s
    structure may be permissionless or permissioned. While permissionless blockchain
    has only one subtype—public blockchain—permissioned blockchain has two subtypes—private
    blockchain and federated blockchain. These are explained in the next three subsections.

    Fig. 3. Types of blockchain. 2.1.1. Public blockchain It is a permissionless blockchain.
    Anyone can join the blockchain network, send a new transaction, and participate
    in the consensus method to add a new block to the ledger. An anonymous person
    can check old records after joining the blockchain network because it is open
    to the public. A secure public blockchain is created by the combination of cryptographic
    verification and economic inducement using Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake
    (PoS). 2.1.2. Private blockchain It is a permissioned blockchain where only a
    particular organization has the authority to join the blockchain, send a new transaction,
    and take part in the consensus mechanism for adding a new block. It follows centralized
    implementation, wherein anyone wanting to join the network must get permission
    from the approved organization. Then, the organization allows a person to read,
    write, or contribute. In the case of a private blockchain, verifying a new block
    takes less time and power because the participant entities are small in number.
    The central authority is forced to use the consensus procedure. 2.1.3. Federated
    blockchain It is also a permissioned blockchain. It is a private blockchain for
    a specific group of businesses. The approval of a specific group of organizations
    is required in order to join this blockchain network. Blockchains of such type
    are useful in financial organizations. 2.2. Hash function A hash function is a
    multipurpose function that can be used for generating an address or a digital
    signature and a consensus mechanism. It converts data of any size into fixed-size
    values. It is, however, extremely difficult to retrieve the original data using
    a hash value. Furthermore, hash values of two different pieces of data could never
    be identical. As a result, a hash function is a useful data integrity function.
    According to the complexity of data, SHA 256 and message digest 5 (MD5) are the
    two most commonly utilized hash algorithms in blockchain [31]. 2.3. Merkle Tree
    A Merkle tree is a binary tree-like data structure, as seen in Fig. 4. At a leaf
    node, it stores a hash of transaction data, while at a non-leaf node, it holds
    a hash of transaction data''s descendants. A Merkle root is a tree''s root [32].
    A Merkle tree supports data verification which becomes a challenging task as the
    number of transactions in a distributed peer-to-peer system grows, making the
    process computationally expensive, resource-intensive, and time-consuming. Data
    verification ensures that data are consistent across all nodes. Download : Download
    high-res image (274KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Merkle tree.
    A Merkle tree efficiently carries out the task of data verification. For example,
    to check whether Transaction A has been amended or not, the server provides an
    audit trail of Hash Value CD and Hash Value B information. The node, then, computes
    Hash Value AB using Hash Value A (which it already has) and Hash Value B (which
    the trusted server has provided). After that, a trusted server computes Hash Value
    ABCD from Hash Value AB and Hash Value CD. If calculated Hash Value ABCD is the
    same as the Merkle root of Transaction A, B, C, and D, it validates transaction
    A. 2.4. Smart contract On a blockchain network, a smart contract is a set of lines
    of executable programming codes. It is self-executing and self-verifying and may
    perform a transaction amongst mutually untrustworthy entities. Each contract statement''s
    execution is recorded in a blockchain as an immutable transaction. When any specified
    terms and conditions are met, smart contracts ensure adequate access control and
    control enforcement, and a smart contract is promptly implemented. 2.5. Consensus
    mechanism A fundamental challenge in a blockchain network is obtaining a consensus
    among the mutually untrustworthy individuals. This can be done through the consensus
    method that is used to approve the contents of a ledger. A new block is added
    to a blockchain once it is verified by all other nodes in the network. There are
    several types of consensus mechanisms, out of which we will discuss the five most
    commonly used mechanisms in the following subsections. 2.5.1. Proof of Work Proof
    of Work (PoW) is one of the most commonly used methods to achieve consensus among
    the nodes in a network. It was introduced and employed by Nakamoto for Bitcoin
    [4]. In this approach called “mining” in the cryptocurrency-based blockchain,
    all nodes compete to solve a mathematical challenge. PoW''s primary advantages
    are its decentralized structure, high levels of security, and acceptable levels
    of scalability, whereas its main downsides are low throughput, energy inefficiency,
    high computational cost, and hardware dependency [33]. 2.5.2. Proof of Stake Next
    to PoW, Proof of Stake (PoS) is the most popular consensus mechanism. Here, validators
    are used instead of miners. As a consensus mechanism, Nxt and Blackcoin use PoS.
    Nodes must deposit a particular quantity of coins in the system to prove stakes,
    which decreases the need for processing power [34]. However, nodes with a large
    number of stakes are more likely to become block validators. The benefits of PoS
    include quick block formation, high throughput, low energy consumption, and no
    need for additional hardware. The disadvantage of PoS is that it creates some
    centralization [33]. 2.5.3. Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance To address the
    Byzantine general problem [35], Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) was
    developed [36]. In this technique, first, a block “proposed” based on the round-robin
    procedure is chosen; then, this block advertises to the network and collects 3f+1
    nodes, where f is a failure node. A block proposal becomes valid to add to a blockchain
    network if two-thirds of the validators agree on it. 2.5.4. Proof of Activity
    The authors in Ref. [37] proposed Proof of Activity (PoA) as a hybrid of the finest
    features of PoW and PoS. PoA is the consensus technique used by Decred (DCR) and
    Espers. Mining in PoA begins with PoW and subsequently shifts to PoS. A attack
    in PoA would necessitate mining power and of all coins at the same moment; therefore,
    it is impossible. As a result of this, PoA is more secure than PoW and PoS. 2.5.5.
    Proof of Elapsed Time On top of the SGX technology, Intel has added the Proof
    of Elapsed Time (PoET). The PoET consensus technique is frequently used in permissioned
    blockchains. Each node in blockchain networks produces a random wait time and
    goes to sleep for the set duration after signing the proclamation. The first node
    to wake up adds a new block to the blockchain. PoET is a semi-centralized consensus
    process due to its reliance on Intel. The application context, robustness, kind
    of blockchain platform, and the type of blockchain are all factors to consider
    when choosing a consensus mechanism. As blockchain grows in popularity, the number
    of consensus techniques is growing as well. As a result, designing a consensus
    mechanism in the field of blockchain remains an open challenge. 3. Data collection
    and methodology On June 15th, 2021, the necessary data for conducting a full literature
    review and bibliometric analysis were gathered from the SCOPUS platform. (“Food
    Supply Chain” AND “Blockchain”) OR (“Agri-Food Supply Chain” AND “Blockchain”)
    OR (“Agri Product Supply Chain” AND “Blockchain”) OR (“Agri-Based Food Product
    Supply Chain” AND “Blockchain”) or (“Agricultural Supply Chain” AND “Blockchain”)
    were the phrases used to select the articles. A language filter was used to select
    only the documents written in English. The collected articles were analyzed according
    to the different types of food. Articles dealing with “meat,” “pork,” “halal meat,”
    and “beef” were omitted, as these form a separate area of study. Finally, the
    articles were assessed using the journal index. This analysis excluded articles
    that were not included in these two indexes: Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE)
    or Social Science Citation Index (SSCI). A total of 150 publications were chosen
    as a result of this approach, and their literature review and bibliometric analysis
    are described in sections 4 Literature review, 5 Bibliometric analysis, respectively.

    publications on blockchain in FSCs with two subsections: (i) Application, which
    covers the various applications of blockchain in FSCs, and (ii) Potential solutions
    given by the researchers for blockchain adoption in FSCs and the existing barriers
    for the same. 4.1. Application Blockchain is a decentralized distributed ledger
    system that is one of the disruptive technologies reforming FSCs by improving
    traceability and transparency while removing intermediary reliance. Furthermore,
    by reducing information asymmetry, it improves data management [[38], [39], [40],
    [41]]. Currently, blockchain is being implemented by start-ups as well as existing
    enterprises to reformulate their business models [42] and to provide a secure
    and transparent FSC beneficial in earning consumers'' and stakeholders’ confidence
    [2]. It has been shown that the blockchain technology platform has a substantial
    impact on the digital agri-food business model [43]. RFID, IoT, NFC, big data,
    robotics, and hyperspectral imaging are some emerging technologies aiding the
    development of a traceable FSC. A traceability system for an FSC gives consumers
    an access to check product adulteration and reduces information asymmetry [41,44].
    Blockchain''s advanced information and communication technology in conjugation
    with sensors, such as the IoT and RFID, can make an FSC more efficient. Researchers
    have agreed that in coming years blockchain will be a superior technology for
    ensuring information security, traceability, and autonomy, as well as in providing
    a minimum viable solution for FSCs [30,[45], [46], [47]]. Batch mixing with AI,
    quality forecasting with big data, and a blockchain-based traceability system
    are some other unique technologies that improve the traceability of processed
    foods [48]. In FSCs, blockchain is mainly applied in the field of product authentication,
    finance, and logistics as more transparency and traceability are required in these
    sectors. Therefore, we have divided this literature study into four categories
    (shown in Fig. 6) (i) Product Authentication, (ii) Finance, (iii) Logistics, and
    (iv) Miscellaneous. Miscellaneous category includes the papers which do not come
    under the other three categories, such as reducing labor costs in restaurants,
    smartly scheduling the watering system, and grading the food quality for human
    consumption. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 6. Application of blockchain in FSCs. 4.1.1. Product authentication
    In [49], the authors presented a blockchain-based provenance system for the provenance
    of agricultural products to establish a trust between the stakeholders within
    the agricultural product supply chain. They devised two data-recording structures:
    (1) Basic Planting Information: to keep track of production, storage, and other
    procedures and (2) Provenance Record: to keep track of certain agricultural operations.
    In Ref. [50], the authors used the Proof of Authority consensus mechanism. The
    suggested system is implemented on the Ethereum platform and is tested on Walmart''s
    supply chain. The experimental results showed that the suggested system is capable
    of tracking product provenance while also ensuring data immutability and security.
    The researchers in Ref. [51] proposed a blockchain-based traceability system with
    a smart contract to address classic FSC issues, like security, information asymmetry,
    and system integration challenges. Visibility, security, and operations automation
    were all improved as well. However, the suggested system''s scalability and transaction
    speed had severe flaws. Meanwhile, in Ref. [52], the authors combined a blockchain-based
    Hyperledger fabric technology with the existing traditional FSC to improve transparency
    by tracing food products from farm to fork. They assigned a unique code to each
    type of food and primarily focused on developing a basic blockchain-based FSC
    and reducing the central authority''s oversight. Hyperledger-based food trading
    and traceability system “Hyper-FTT” was introduced by researchers in Ref. [53]
    for government, enterprises, and consumers. Aggregation of food warehouse companies,
    food processing enterprises, and food retailers was required to reach an agreement
    and complete a commercial transaction throughout the chain, which could help develop
    trust in food tracking. The experiments’ results revealed that the order service
    has a significant impact on the system throughput in various setups. The authors
    in Ref. [54] introduced ProductChain to find the provenance of a product that
    was under the jurisdiction of an FSC organization. ProductChain is a three-tier
    permissioned blockchain-based structure that ensures that data are available to
    consumers. The testing results showed that the suggested framework only takes
    a few milliseconds to query the order''s product ledger. Furthermore, security
    research revealed that the proposed system is adaptable to a large number of customers
    as well as network-based threats. In [55], the authors proposed a blockchain-based
    FSC traceability architecture. It manages supply chain stakeholders and product
    creation processes with the help of a smart contract. The proposed system, applied
    to the dairy industry, provides a complete traceability flow. To limit the degree
    of centralization, the researchers proposed a blockchain-based traceability system
    built on the Hyperledger Fabric platform in Ref. [56]. Milk was chosen as the
    subject of food traceability. They worked on the overall design as well as the
    network architecture. The authors in Ref. [57] proposed a unique information system
    architecture based on blockchain for a grain supply chain. The proposed system
    is a unique platform that improves blockchain storage efficiency by adopting a
    multimode storage technique. Furthermore, a customized smart contract was proposed
    to achieve corporate data interaction and supply chain hazard information supervision.
    The Hyperledger Fabric was used to create the prototype system. The proposed system
    was tested using a specific test case. The findings showed that the suggested
    method assures food safety and information storage dependability. However, the
    question regarding the data''s reliability still remains. The usage of sensors,
    such as the IoT, to collect data could help solve this problem. The authors in
    Ref. [58] presented a private blockchain-based traceability system made up of
    five Ethereum-based organizations that employed a smart contract to audit all
    transactions inside the supply chain entities. The InterPlanetary File System
    (IPFS) stores all the validated transaction data. The findings of the experiments
    were also promising. AgroVita, based on blockchain, was proposed in Ref. [59]
    as a way to empower customers, farmers, and retailers. At each stage of the proposed
    system, the transaction data were stored in blockchain, and each entity had access
    to track the products from farm to retailer. It established a traceability system
    that can be trusted. Consumers have adequate knowledge about food products to
    decide whether or not they want to buy, thanks to the unique methodology described
    in Ref. [60] to integrate blockchain in FSCs. In addition, a case study on the
    use of blockchain in the Colombian organic coffee sector was completed. Its methodology''s
    versatility and adaptability make it suited for any product and supply chain.
    The authors in Ref. [61] proposed a blockchain-based FoodTrail system, which improves
    FSC traceability. The suggested system has a four-layer design and is built on
    the Hyperledger Sawtooth framework. The depth-first technique was used to examine
    the blockchain''s stored data. The results of the experiments demonstrated that
    it underperforms when conducting a transaction. However, it does not rely on intermediaries,
    which reduces its dependency on a third party and lowers implementation costs.
    In [62], the authors presented a traceability system for e-commerce agricultural
    products based on blockchain to ensure these items’ food safety and quality. The
    authors in Ref. [63] utilized blockchain for seed supply chain traceability. The
    authors in Ref. [64] presented a blockchain application for the information security
    of an FSC and compared it to the classical supply chain in the context of China.
    According to the findings, the introduced application can assist manufacturers
    and consumers in tracking, auditing, and verifying an FSC. In [65], the author
    proposed a complete solution for a blockchain-based FSC that gives a solution
    from start to finish for each operation. It is built on the Ethereum platform,
    and interaction between actors within supply chain smart contracts is used. IPFS
    was utilized to get the hash value of the transaction data stored on the blockchain
    instead of transaction data. According to simulation results, the suggested system
    requires a particular amount of gas for smart contract deployment and execution.
    The researchers in Ref. [66] also employed IPFS for a blockchain-based traceability
    system for a soybean supply chain built on the Ethereum platform and smart contracts
    to regulate all transactions among all organizations inside the supply chain.
    A public blockchain traceability system using a smart contract was proposed to
    ensure transparency in the organic FSC in Ref. [67]. Farmers’ reputation was determined
    together with their products using a token-based approach; farmers could acquire
    a reputation by placing certification. The ASC uses a unique QR code to validate
    the food quality and origin. The researchers in Ref. [68] also employed a QR code
    to verify goods. The newly introduced blockchain-based traceability solution based
    on the Hyperledger Sawtooth platform can be used for the European Union and linked
    with existing traceability standards and processes. In [69], the authors introduced
    an information system that effectively tracks and monitors the entire food process
    from farm to fork, as well as critical stages of production, logistics, and land
    auditing. They presented consumers with an application that allowed them to obtain
    information about the production process they had purchased. The authors in Ref.
    [70] proposed a “blockchain + agriculture” traceability system for food safety.
    The proposed model is divided into four layers: data, technology, management,
    and application. It lowers the cost of data storage while increasing operational
    efficiency. In [71], the authors proposed a one-code-one-item system to improve
    food traceability on the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain technology. It assigns
    a unique QR code to each food item and encrypts it using AES encryption technology.
    The authors in Ref. [72] presented a blockchain-based solution for the Italian
    Carasau bread supply chain that includes smart contracts, IPFS, and IoT to enable
    transparent, secure, and auditable traceability. All actors in the supply chain
    may verify the product''s quality. In [73], the authors presented a blockchain-based
    tracking system for fruit and vegetable agricultural products to address the issue
    of centralized administration. It improves the traceability of information''s
    transparency and believability. A dual storage structure of on-chain and off-chain
    was introduced to alleviate the load pressure on the chain. Furthermore, the performance
    analysis results revealed that the suggested system fits the criteria of the actual
    application. In [74], the authors introduced a blockchain-based tracing system
    for cocoa production. Watermarking technique was used for authentication and detection
    of manipulation of data. The proposed solution is more robust due to the usage
    of a two-factor blockchain for data documentation and validation. The authors
    in Ref. [75] proposed a blockchain-based FSC provenance system that was coupled
    with IoT and advanced deep learning. Using this system, before consuming, consumers
    can track the food''s provenance. Stakeholders can use advanced deep learning
    technology to optimize their inventory by collecting future projections and temporal
    trends of food consumption. The suggested system''s examined result is encouraging.
    In [76], the authors proposed the BRUSCHETTA traceability system built on blockchain
    and coupled with IoT that certified the extra virgin olive oil. Data were recorded
    using the suggested system built on the Hyperledger Fabric platform. In Ref. [77],
    the authors proposed the two-stage containerized supply chain using the Hyperledger
    Fabric platform and Proof of Concept as a consensus mechanism. The authors in
    Ref. [78] designed double chain, a public blockchain that provides transparency,
    security, and privacy for an ASC. Furthermore, the authors in Ref. [79] introduced
    a theoretical food traceability system based on blockchain, coupled with IoT,
    and constructed on the Ethereum platform. They utilized a smart contract with
    GS1 message standards to promote transparency in the ASC. The researchers suggested
    a SafeFood solution based on blockchain, integrated with IoT, and developed on
    the Hyperledger platform in Ref. [] [80] to track food products from farm to store.
    Furthermore, in Ref. [81], the authors presented a blockchain-based smart model
    to improve food safety and traceability, increasing consumer trust. The introduced
    model also utilizes a smart contract. In [] [82], the authors proposed a generic
    architecture to explain the granularity levels in the supply chain traceability
    system based on blockchain and IoT. The smart contract minimizes the traceability
    limitations in terms of security, information sharing, and competing interests.
    In [83], the authors proposed AgriBlockIoT as a traceability solution based on
    blockchain and IoT. Data were collected via an IoT sensor. They examined the amount
    of time it took to set a value in the blockchain (latency), the processing power
    of each node (CPU load), and the network consumption in each test. They discovered
    that Hyperledger Sawtooth outperforms Ethereum in terms of performance. Similarly
    [84,85], proposed a traceability system that combines IoT with blockchain. Furthermore,
    in Ref. [85], the authors presented a traceability system based on Ethereum, which
    was useful for constructing DApps. In [86], a blockchain-based traceability system
    with RFID was introduced for the AFSC''s industry. The suggested system gathers
    data and organizes information at each link to improve food safety and quality
    while also increasing transparency within the supply chain network. Furthermore,
    it aids in the reduction of losses throughout the logistics process. The authors
    in Ref. [87] proposed a blockchain-based traceability system that integrates IoT
    with Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP). The proposed system
    is beneficial in increasing customer openness and confidence. BigchainDB, a new
    database with high throughput, low latency, high capacity, decentralized control,
    immutability, and the creation and movement of digital assets, was introduced
    to address the scalability issue. The authors in Ref. [88] developed a total of
    five models. Regression analysis was used to test three hypotheses about the “Internet+”
    based traceability system. The report claimed that “Internet+” big data, big technologies,
    and big platforms can significantly impact product traceability in an ASC and
    that blockchain can help determine the origin of agricultural products to improve
    quality and safety. In [89], the authors proposed a traceability system based
    on blockchain and IoT to track eggs from Bytable Inc. in the Midwest of the United
    States using Proof of Concept as a consensus method. The suggested method delivers
    critical product information to consumers while also increasing transparency inside
    the supply chain. The researchers developed a blockchain-enabled rice supply chain
    management (RSCM) architecture for the Food Corporation of India (FCI) in Ref.
    [90]. Under this architecture, if necessary, rice stock from a batch can be easily
    recalled. It uses an immutable digital platform to store data, making RSCM more
    transparent and efficient. In [91,92], the researchers presented a decentralized
    food traceability system based on blockchain and the Electronic Product Code (EPC)
    Information System. To avoid the data explosion problem, this system uses blockchain
    to keep traceability information on-chain. At the same time, other food-related
    data are saved off-chain using EPC, and an enterprise-level smart contract is
    employed to secure critical business information. In Refs. [93,94] agri-food was
    tracked and traced using BT, RFID, and IoT. In [94], the authors used Proof of
    Object as a consensus technique in the proposed system. According to security
    analysis, the number of bogus blocks validated reduces as the number of participants’
    nodes increases within the network. The author of [95] suggested a blockchain-based
    traceability system with IoT integration for the seafood supply chain. The authors
    in Ref. [96] presented a blockchain-based traceability system that is connected
    to IoT and includes an RFID sensor. At every stage of the supply chain, food packages
    are scanned. The data are stored in the blockchain under this system after network
    participants reach a consensus. Food Safety Quick Response Block (FoodSQRBlock),
    a blockchain-based system suggested in Ref. [97], digitizes food production information
    in QR codes and makes verification easy for customers and producers. They used
    Google Cloud Platform to construct FoodSQRBlock to replicate a food production
    scenario using milk and pumpkins as examples from genuine farms in the UK. The
    results of the experiment suggested that the proposed framework is practical and
    scalable. The key challenges in the e-commerce market include monopoly, duplicate
    products, and uncertainty. PRODCHAIN, a blockchain-based solution, was discussed
    by the authors in Ref. [98]. They established “Proof of Accomplishment,” a consensus
    process based on ratings. PRODCHAIN allows data to be traced from the development
    of a product through its use. The experiment and analysis were carried out on
    the Ethereum network. In [99], the authors introduced a revolutionary information
    storage architecture based on the Hyperledger blockchain which included visualization
    technology. The food safety hazards of unqualified detection data can be statistically
    examined on this platform, and a food safety risk assessment model based on failure
    rate and qualification deviation can be constructed. Visual tools such as heat
    maps were used in risk analysis to highlight where unqualified products appeared,
    and a migration map and a force-directed graph were utilized to track these items.
    Furthermore, the food sample data for the year of 2016 were used as the experimental
    data for testing the method''s validity. As an example, a case study involving
    aquatic items was investigated, with the results demonstrating the risks intuitively.
    The authors in Ref. [100] addressed an ancient problem of agricultural product
    quality and delivery from farmers to consumers. They proposed that small farmers
    can use blockchain to promote transparency, security, and confidence in agricultural
    product transactions. The authors in Ref. [101] proposed a smart contract based
    blockchain to enable transparent and auditable traceability for the Italian Carasau
    bread supply chain. They concluded that each supply chain actor can demonstrate
    the superiority of products along the chain and reassure customers about the products’
    appropriateness for consumption. The study in Ref. [102] provided a conceptual
    framework for increasing food safety trust during food transactions. They looked
    at China''s food trade with the European Union as an item. The conceptual framework
    was created to make use of an existing traceability system already in place at
    both locations. The approaches of on-chain and off-chain data storage were both
    recommended. A blockchain network was also used to deploy the smart contract.

    Method – – – 4.1.2. Finance According to the study [103], research papers related
    to blockchain integrated with IoT focused primarily on food quality, safety, transparency,
    and data privacy. The development of a well-organized agricultural marketing system
    has the potential to improve farmers’ economic conditions. In Ref. [104], the
    authors introduced a conceptual framework based on blockchain that uses the Ethereum
    platform and smart contracts to address the issue of low returns for Indian farmers.
    The authors in Ref. [105] argued that blockchain-based systems stimulate fair
    trade and reduce management expenses in the context of small and medium firms
    in Denmark. However, due to complexity and lack of understanding of blockchain,
    its adoption on a large scale is still in its infancy. In [106], the authors presented
    a mechanism for integrating blockchain into the existing AFSC to improve environmental
    and social sustainability without limiting economic sustainability. In [107],
    the authors explored investment decisions and coordination in a green agri-food
    supply chain with information services based on blockchain and big data, as well
    as an appropriate supply chain architecture in the fusion application environment.
    The results of the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) analysis showed that blockchain
    is a key technology for creating an efficient supply chain. Fair trading and a
    circular economy are achieved by the proposed theoretical model of public blockchain
    produced on the Ethereum platform [108]. In [109], the authors presented a case
    study of Devoleum, a start-up in the agri-food sector that has yet to be institutionalized.
    The CAOS (Characteristic, Ambience, Organization, Start-up) model was used to
    conduct the research. The findings showed that blockchain ensures transparency,
    traceability, security, and unchangeable data throughout the network. The researchers
    in Ref. [110] concluded that blockchain adoption in grains industry could boost
    production. They arrived at this conclusion by using computable general equilibrium
    (CGE) simulation modeling, which showed that introducing blockchain in grains
    and finance sectors might boost Australian gross domestic product (GDP) by . The
    author proposed “KHET,” a decentralized platform built on blockchain, to promote
    traditional farming in Ref. [111]. Ethereum blockchain network was employed in
    the proposed platform. As the proposed approach eliminates the need for a third
    party between farmers and the market, producers can now sell their crops at the
    price they want. Moreover, the authors in Ref. [112] proposed a blockchain-based
    model built on the Hyperledger framework to limit the participation of the middle
    man. As a result, farmers’ income is maximized. Three aspects were considered
    in this model: cost, quality, and source. The authors in Ref. [113] proposed a
    blockchain-based traceability system for an ASC built on the Ethereum platform.
    Smart contracts were utilized at various levels in this system to verify that
    all pre-determined requirements were met before progressing to transactions. This
    technology provides security, dependability, trust, and transparency. It makes
    transactions and administrative procedures easier. Farmers are given a fair chance
    to quote a price utilizing smart contracts. According to a study published in
    Ref. [114], blockchain can greatly improve the international trade supply chain.
    Blockchain''s data integrity and traceability properties aid customs authorities
    in ensuring the safety of local society and the economy. In the context of India,
    the researchers in Ref. [115] proposed a blockchain, information and communication
    technologies (ICT), and big data analytics architecture for the next generation
    agriculture marketing system. The authors in Ref. [116] proposed a blockchain-based
    FSC architecture to eliminate the need for a middleman in FSCs. Data were collected
    at each level of the proposed design using an IoT sensor. The study showed that
    consumers can examine the acquired data to determine whether or not they wish
    to buy, and warehouses can better manage their inventory. In [117], the authors
    presented “Provider-Consumer Network,” a generic end-to-end theoretical food traceability
    application, to simply boost transparency by efficiently delivering distributed
    ledger to every consumer within the network. The presented application was created
    using a smart contract on the Ethereum platform. Further, it was shown to have
    the potential of reducing corruption and boosting the country''s economy. The
    researchers offered various theories to change the AFSC management using modern
    institutional economics, behavioral economics, and management in their work [118].
    They presented two case studies from China that demonstrated how their suggested
    blockchain-based system can disrupt agri-food supply chain management. The authors
    in Ref. [119] conducted a thorough investigation into the influence of blockchain
    on the performance of lemon and orange supply chains. According to the findings,
    blockchain has a favorable impact on investment return, food quality, and communication
    between stages of a supply chain. The summary of the above-discussed papers is
    given in Table 2. Table 2. Summary of articles related to finance. References

    of food businesses. However, to ensure the widespread use of blockchain in food
    logistics, it is critical to standardize data collection, representation, and
    storage mechanisms to ensure that any negative effects on consumers are minimized
    [120]. In [121], the authors proposed a solution based on blockchain and smart
    contracts to provide security, integrity, and reliability for the logistics industry.
    They put the model to the test for two real-world scenarios: (1) to identify food
    product ingredients and (2) to track them from the manufacturer to the client.
    Further, the solution demonstrated the transport''s transparency and authentication.
    In [122], the authors presented a broad technique for developing blockchain use
    cases. They analyzed the results of a fresh food delivery use case and concluded
    that blockchain can play a key role in lowering logistic costs. Based on ten logistics
    sector applications, the authors in Ref. [123] proposed an explanatory model for
    coordinating with actors in a blockchain-enabled operation supply chain. Their
    investigation was based on a compilation of use cases that represent a small part
    of a larger logistics business with many diverse participants all over the world.
    According to this study, blockchain is extremely effective, and it has the potential
    to help firms make permanent changes to their business models. The Carbon Footprint
    Chain (CFC), first introduced in Ref. [124], is a cluster-based architecture.
    It is a lightweight distributed system that tracks the carbon footprint of food
    as it moves from one step to the next. It consists of six clusters, each representing
    a stage in the food life-cycle, and uses a Raft-like consensus method. The block
    keeps track of transactions as the food moves from one stage to the other. Each
    block comprises information on products moved, carbon footprint, mileage, and
    preceding cluster information, among other things. The summary of the above-discussed
    papers is given in Table 3. Table 3. Summary of articles related to logistics.

    a sustainable and digital marketing based e-agricultural supply chain model based
    on web-design features employing blockchain to create a solid and sustainable
    platform for attracting buyers to agricultural products. It also ensures that
    such products are traceable, secure, and delivered on time. The proposed model
    was tested in a real-time industrial setting, with five different scenarios based
    on mutual share, demand curve, and e-advertisement budget. The scenario in which
    the partners split the appropriate e-advertisement cost for digital marketing
    yielded the greatest profit for the supply chain management (SCM). A reduction
    in transportation and third-party logistics participation lowers the selling price
    of agricultural products compared to traditional SCM. The study in Ref. [126]
    identified and established linkages between blockchain and an Indian AFSC. Anonymity
    and privacy, auditability, decentralized database, immutability, enhanced risk
    management, provenance, decreased transaction costs, reduced settlement lead times,
    secured database, smart contracts, traceability, and transparency were among the
    thirteen enablers identified in the this literature. They used a combination of
    Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) and Decision-making Trial and Evaluation
    Laboratory (DEMATEL) approach to assess these enablers. The following are the
    most important enablers out of the total: traceability, auditability, immutability,
    and provenance. The authors in Ref. [127] used a technology assessment framework
    to look at six cases of companies: FairChain, IBM Food Trust, OpenSC, Provenance,
    TE-FOOD, and WWF pilot blockchain-based technologies for the FSC using four criteria:
    technique, knowledge, organization, and product. This research provided a thorough
    understanding of the role of blockchains in the field of FSC. The authors in Ref.
    [128] proposed a blockchain-based framework for securing food data storage origin
    provenance. The suggested platform is based on the Ethereum platform. The proposed
    platform ensures openness, encourages the use of native Sardinia products, and
    promotes their smart tourism as well. The authors investigated the integration
    of blockchain with the precision irrigation (PI) environment in Ref. [129]. PI
    is the use of sensors and network units to make the best use of irrigation resources.
    It is a good way to manage the scarcity of critical resources, including food,
    water, land, and crop yields. Meanwhile, the internet is an open channel for receiving
    precise readings from sensor units. As a result, malevolent intruders have the
    potential to assault PI-sensors. According to the research, combining PI with
    blockchain improves efficiency, robustness, trust, and security. In [130], the
    authors proposed a water control system to monitor and coordinate water consumption
    among villages being irrigated. Blockchain was used to help members of a community
    build trust. The proposed system''s implementation and evaluation were also discussed.
    The authors in Ref. [131] proposed an intelligent smart watering system based
    on IoT, blockchain, and fuzzy logic. This system is made up of various sensors
    that record plant and environmental data in real-time. Blockchain provides security,
    scalability, privacy, and dependability, while fuzzy logic aids in decision-making
    regarding watering requirements. The researchers in Ref. [132], a secondary source
    of data and questionnaires, conducted interviews with diverse cocoa producers
    to explore the role of blockchain in addressing issues, such as child labor and
    deforestation. In [133], the authors proposed a blockchain-based reputation system
    for an AFSC to maintain the integrity of trading entities and product quality
    ratings. According to simulation results, the suggested system requires a specific
    amount of time to mine the transaction. To improve the ledger efficiency of a
    vegetable supply chain, the authors in Ref. [134] constructed a blockchain framework
    on Hyperledger Fabric with nine channels and crash fault-tolerant by using Apache
    Kafka. The Repelling and Notifying System, a blockchain-based architecture combined
    with an IoT preventive system, was proposed in Ref. [135] to safeguard crops against
    animal assault at all stages of harvest. The efficiency of the sensors can be
    seen by adjusting them using tree-topology, experimental, and simulation findings.
    Up-to-date data delivery, adequate multi-hop connectivity, data transfer security,
    and low cost are the primary aspects of the proposed system that make it useful
    in developing nations. In agriculture, IoT-based greenhouse technology is currently
    employed for remote control. As it is a new technology, security and privacy are
    major concerns. In Ref. [136], the authors proposed a blockchain-based, lightweight
    framework for smart greenhouse farms to overcome the aforementioned concerns.
    It creates a standard platform for securely transmitting data across a distributed
    network. The authors in Ref. [137] depicted the basic design of the functional
    and non-functional architecture of a decentralized app for various food courts,
    together with a specific user interface design (UI). Restaurant personnel can
    organize their online menu and keep track of their customers’ orders, while customers
    can order food from anywhere. The authors in Ref. [138] proposed the restaurant
    model, which utilizes product identifiers to improve food traceability. The suggested
    model gathers data and uses the Food Quality Index (FQI) algorithm to provide
    an FQI value that can be used to judge whether or not the food is edible. As consumers
    prefer an online inquiry over an offline order, this is a growing trend. Customers
    can browse a food menu from anywhere utilizing food court web design and cellular-based
    apps, and shops can deliver food orders on time. In [139], the authors proposed
    an intelligent fruit juice monitoring system with high automation and reliability.
    This monitoring system was built on a smart contract and evaluation model. A smart
    contract was used to record production data on a blockchain, and the evaluation
    model was utilized as input. The traceability of blockchain transactions and the
    automatic execution of smart contracts aid in the achievement of dependable and
    efficient quality control. The authors in Ref. [140] proposed a credit evaluation
    system. A smart contract collected credit ratings from traders, and the text was
    analyzed using a deep learning approach called Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM).
    The experimental results showed that using LSTM for credit evaluation is superior
    to using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Nave Bayes (NB) for credit evaluation.
    To defend the rights of temporary workers, researchers proposed a blockchain-based
    D-ES (Decentralized Employment System) in Ref. [141]. In addition, a case study
    on temporary work in the agriculture industry was conducted. The researchers presented
    a detailed summary of blockchain technology legislation and regulations in Ref.
    [142]. The authors in Ref. [143] used a rating-based conjoint analysis to identify
    some potential drivers of blockchain adoption using a grape wine supply chain
    as an object. The study revealed that disintermediation, traceability, trust,
    price, compliance, and coordination are all factors that influence blockchain
    adoption. Researchers working collaboratively on vegetable-based product face
    the difficulties related to information traceability and transparency in results.
    The authors in Ref. [144] proposed blockchain-based architecture that provides
    a decentralized storage location for all information and uses smart contracts
    to address these issues. The traceability system''s architecture varies depending
    on geography, culture, and product. To standardize the traditional traceability
    method, blockchain and AI are now available. The EU and China have established
    significant commercial ties that will definitely benefit both economies in the
    coming years. Adopting a uniform traceability system is a necessary foundation
    for the long-term viability of these trade ties [145]. A typical blockchain contains
    all data in one file, which leads to delayed transmission and parsing of the blockchain
    data file as the file size grows. To address this issue, the authors presented
    in Ref. [146] an efficient and secure storage framework based on an enhanced blockchain,
    which is a secure storage architecture for high-throughput crop breeding data
    based on the blockchain technology (SACBDIBT). In [147], the author used a methodology
    based on interpretative structural modeling (ISM) coupled with fuzzy-decision-making
    trial and evaluation laboratory (F-DEMATEL) to build a sustainable AFSC managed
    with technologies, such as IoT blockchain, robotics, and big data. Information
    processing theory (IPT) and dynamical capabilities theory (DPT) were used to identify
    14 enablers of an IoT-based multi-tier sustainable food security system. ISM and
    F-DEMATEL were, then, used to evaluate these enablers. The results showed that
    the 13th enabler (cold chain for perishable items) was the first, and the 14th
    enabler (sustainable-based competitive ASC) was the last. Route optimization and
    replicating the consumption pattern were also the most sensitive facilitators,
    according to the findings. The summary of the above-discussed papers is given
    in Table 4. Table 4. Summary of articles related to Miscellaneous. References

    Factor Description References Transaction Throughput Refers to the maximum number
    of transactions a protocol can handle in a single second. [152,153] Computational
    Energy Indicates whether the algorithm or the employing system uses a lot of energy
    to mine blocks. The special high-end hardware consumes more energy, resulting
    in higher consumption costs. [17,20] Cost Refers to the entire cost of confirming
    a transaction in a blockchain. [20,143,152] 4.2. Challenges and suggestions for
    improving the performance of blockchain technology In this section, the current
    challenges in this field are discussed, along with the potential solutions provided
    by researchers for blockchain adoption in FSCs. 4.2.1. Challenges The applicability
    and significance of blockchain in FSCs is quite clear in increasing traceability,
    maintaining transparency, and in generating confidence amongst providers, farmers,
    suppliers, retailers, and consumers. However, blockchain is currently in a nascent
    stage of development and has to face certain barriers that hinder its adoption
    in FSCs, as pointed out by several researchers [12,[148], [154], [155], [156],
    [157]]. Most researchers have discussed four main challenges pertaining to blockchain
    adoption, which are scalability, interoperability, security and privacy, and data
    authentication. These are discussed in the subsequent subsections. • Scalability:
    Issues related to scalability occur in blockchains as block sizes grow larger
    leading to adverse effects on factors, like transaction throughput, computational
    energy, and cost. This has been considered as a major challenge by the blockchain
    research community [13,39,47,55,[148], [149], [150]]. Factors related to scalability,
    their description, and the corresponding references are given in Table 5. • Interoperability:
    Interoperability refers to the capacity of blockchains to share and communicate
    with one another. Currently, many blockchain projects, written in different programming
    languages on different platforms, are active. Due to lack of interoperability,
    different blockchain networks are unable to connect with one another, resulting
    in network isolation and information asymmetry. Therefore a novel interoperable
    communication protocol should be proposed [17,20]. • Security and privacy: Blockchain
    technology provides immutable data storage, decentralized network, and peer-to-peer
    communication which enhances security and privacy. However, currently blockchain
    technology is becoming a target for hackers, who can launch cyber-attacks from
    the protocol side, implementation side, and there could be logical defects as
    well [17,148]. • Data Authentication: Sensors are still heavily used in blockchain
    technology to capture raw data. Blockchains do not have a verification mechanism
    to establish whether the raw data are legitimate or not, despite the fact that
    the data remain immutable [151]. Besides the above-mentioned limitations of blockchain,
    some other problems pointed out by researchers are as follows: • The researchers
    in Ref. [158] identified a potential assault known as the “Hilt Shao Attack,”
    which might occur at the early stages of product registration and demonstrated
    it as a sort of attack employing unique identification (UID) and unique changeable
    identification (CUID) tags. • In the Indian context, researchers in Ref. [159]
    pointed out ten major hurdles in blockchain adoption in AFSCs. These barriers
    were modeled using an integrated ISM-DEMATEL technique, in which ISM assessed
    the interrelationships between the identified constructs and DEMATEL looked at
    the severity of the link. The findings revealed that the most significant challenges
    to blockchain adoption in AFSCs are “lack of government regulation” and “lack
    of confidence among agro stakeholders.” In addition, security, privacy concerns,
    and a lack of blockchain awareness are other major hurdles. 4.2.2. Potential solutions
    • As the majority of people are unaware of blockchain technology, its global implementation
    is infeasible. Therefore, many trials should be conducted to remove demerits before
    blockchain is implemented in FSCs [150]. • The author of [160] proposed LC4IoT
    with lightweight consensus to address sufficient processing power and significant
    delay issues. Extensive simulations were used to test this newly incorporated
    consensus. • In Ref. [161], the authors suggested a prominent architecture based
    on the Ethereum platform. The proposed architecture is useful for auditing and
    tracking the food processing industry because it aggregates data time-to-time.
    After incorporating blockchain into AFSCs, the trial findings suggested its little
    impact on consumer prices. However, as we proceeded further, down the supply chain
    ecosystem, operating costs increased. • The researchers in Ref. [144] devised
    a traceability system based on blockchain to tackle the issues related to scalability,
    throughput, access control, and data retrieval. • To overhaul the current logistics
    system, the researchers in Ref. [162] proposed a system based on blockchain. The
    suggested approach eliminates intermediaries, improves security, reduces distribution
    delays, and provides efficient AFSCs by utilizing a smart contract and multi-agent
    system (MAS). • A framework proposed in Ref. [163] addresses two issues: business
    privacy and determining whether or not data need to be stored on a blockchain.
    As a result, it is useful to associate the dimensions of data attributes (static
    or dynamic) and data requirements with blockchain dataflow items (mandatory or
    optional). It also included a dataflow reference model for stakeholders along
    AFSCs and a dataflow matrix for analyzing stakeholders'' access rights to traceable
    food data. • To address the “last mile” problem, the authors in Ref. [164] used
    videogrammetry to capture product lifecycle data on a digital blockchain. According
    to this study, data verification in a blockchain can be done by using videogrammetry,
    RFID sensors, and fingerprint sensors. • Physical food products are represented
    digitally in the universal blockchain-based system proposed in Ref. [165]. The
    authors utilized ordinary and thermal pictures for training machine-learning models
    on visual aspects of food products. The study also proposed a way to reward supply
    chain ecosystem actors who encourage honesty and data sharing. • The study in
    Ref. [166] specified 18 boundary constraints for exchanging assertion information
    to improve AFSC traceability. Regulation, traceability, quality, and business
    were the four types of boundary conditions. The findings demonstrated that altering
    the supply chain system and institutional measures can increase traceability if
    the boundary requirements are met. • There are several types of blockchains and
    consensus mechanisms to choose from. It is not easy to determine which blockchain
    and consensus mechanism are best for a given application. The authors in Ref.
    [156] proposed a blockchain applicability framework (BAF) to address these concerns.
    5. Bibliometric analysis Bibliometric analysis is a statistical evaluation of
    published scientific articles, books, surveys and book chapters, in which qualitative
    conclusions are drawn from figures and values available in published works [167].
    As blockchain is only a decade old and is being adopted by industries other than
    finance, a bibliometric study is required. The distribution of reviewed papers
    based on blockchain''s application in FSCs is shown in Fig. 7. According to it,
    blockchain has most applications in the field of product authentication. As per
    Fig. 8 and Fig. 9, mostly the Ethereum platform employing smart contracts is used
    for applying blockchain in FSCs. Download : Download high-res image (223KB) Download

    Additionally, the analysis was executed using VoSviewer [168] and Bibliometrix
    R-Tool [169] on the collected 150 articles. VoSviewer is an open-source application
    for creating, visualizing, and exploring network maps [168]. However, Bibliometrix
    is an open-source application written in R that performs a complete science mapping
    analysis of scientific articles. Both these programs are simple to use. Their
    use does not necessitate any prior programming skills. 5.1. Number of scientific
    publications: output analysis The main information regarding data collected from
    the SCOPUS library that is generated in Bibliometric analysis is shown in Table
    6. The number of research papers getting published every year is depicted in Fig.
    10. Since 2018, there has been a considerable increase in the number of publications,
    indicating an upward trend. As demonstrated in Fig. 11, the number of journal
    papers is higher than the number of conference papers, while the number of book
    chapters is the lowest. Table 6. Main information about data collected from the

    Conceptual thematic map. Of the literature, the study topics in quadrant Type
    1 are considered (motor) mainstream themes. This quadrant contains FSC-related
    and upcoming technology topics, such as food safety, food quality, food integrity,
    blockchain, AI, and machine learning. The Type 2 quadrant contains themes with
    low density and high centrality, which are considered basic themes. As a result,
    there are basic topics related to FSCs with blockchain in this quadrant, such
    as blockchain, traceability, smart contracts, and IoT. The themes considered in
    quadrant Type 3 are high density and low centrality, called niche themes. Supply
    chain management and consensus mechanisms are included under this type. Finally,
    quadrant Type 4 includes issues with low density and low centrality, which are
    referred to as nascent or underdeveloped. The themes under this category are emerging
    themes; AFSC is the key topic in this cluster. Section 4''s extensive study shows
    that AFSC needs additional attention now. 5.3. Science mapping analysis In this
    section, we discuss how authors, countries, documents, and sources are linked
    in the bibliography. There also exist a co-citation network analysis for the authors,
    sources, and references, and a keyword co-occurrence analysis. The goal of the
    mapping analysis is to determine the research pattern in this emerging topic and
    provide a feasible future research path. 5.3. Bibliographic Coupling Analysis
    Two articles are bibliographically coupled if at least one cited source appears
    in both references lists [170]. The network visualization of bibliographic coupling
    is shown in Fig. 20, which considers articles with at least ten citations. In
    the figure, a node symbolizes an article, its size denotes the number of citations,
    and a link represents bibliographic couplings. The results of the bibliographic
    coupling analysis are summarized in Table 13. Download : Download high-res image

    the article titled “An agri-food supply chain traceability system for China based
    on RFID & blockchain technology” [86] has the most citations (461). “Applying
    blockchain technology to improve agri-food traceability: A review of development
    methods, benefits and challenges” [154] is the article with the greatest link
    strength value of “151.” 5.3.2. Co-citation analysis When two articles are cited
    in the same article, it is known as co-citation. Co-citation analysis is, thus,
    the antithesis of bibliographic coupling. The network visualization of the co-citation
    analysis of authors is shown in Fig. 21, which considers authors with at least
    ten citations. A node represents an author, its size denotes an author''s citations,
    and a connection symbolizes a co-citation. Similarly, Fig. 22 depicts the network
    visualization of source co-citation analysis taking into account sources with
    at least ten citations. A node represents a source, its size denotes the source''s
    citation, and a link shows co-citation. Table 14 summarizes the result of the
    co-citation analysis. Tian, F. is the author with maximum “107” co-citations.
    The journal “Food Control” has maximum co-citations (160 citations). Download

    Co-word analysis The co-word analysis attempts to uncover the conceptual structure
    by using a “word co-occurrence network” to map and cluster the terms collected
    from keywords in a bibliographic collection. The keyword network is depicted in
    Fig. 23, which comprises keywords that appeared in at least three articles. A
    thick line denotes a close relationship between two items, and a node''s size
    denotes their frequency. Table 15 presents a summary of the findings. Download

    safety (40 occurrences, link strength 310). 6. Discussion The focus of this research
    was on blockchain in FSCs. To better understand the applicability, challenges,
    solutions, and current research trends, this study conducted a complete literature
    review and bibliometric analysis of 150 papers relevant to blockchain in FSCs.
    After data were collected from the SCOPUS database, the selected articles were
    grouped according to four relevant applications of blockchain in FSCs, namely
    product authentication, finance, logistics, and miscellaneous. We addressed three
    research questions in this paper. The RQ1 focused on blockchain''s role in alleviating
    the burden on the global FSC due to population growth. Traditional FSCs are under
    tremendous strain as a result of the expanding population. After a thorough investigation,
    the authors discovered that blockchain is a well-known technology that has the
    potential to transform FSCs into a decentralized system that improves transparency
    and traceability while lowering the risk of food fraud and information asymmetry.
    Food safety, food integrity, food quality, optimizing trade supply chains, improving
    the inventory, ensuring farmers receive a fair price for their crops, building
    economic sustainability, reducing logistics costs, tracking carbon footprint during
    food transportation, and smartly scheduling watering are all benefits of the blockchain-based
    framework. The RQ2 was focused on potential solutions given by the researchers
    and the current challenges for integrating blockchain in FSCs. While blockchain
    enables decentralized and traceable FSCs, there are several impediments to its
    implementation, including scalability, high cost, high energy consumption, interoperability,
    data authenticity, lack of understanding, privacy, sensitive data handling, and
    technological aspects. Many trials should be conducted to eliminate these limitations
    and improve the use of blockchain in FSCs. Blockchain integrated with sensors,
    like IoT, RFID, and NFC, for data capturing, can be useful to remove false data
    entries. The RQ3 was addressed by the bibliometric analysis of all collected research
    papers to examine the current research trend. The year-by-year trend of the reviewed
    publications revealed a significant increase in publications in recent years,
    indicating a growing interest in this area among academics and researchers. A
    conceptual thematic map and a science mapping analysis are also provided. 7. Conclusions
    and future scope The objective of this study was to analyze the implementation
    of blockchain in FSCs through an extensive literature survey and bibliometric
    analysis, carried out using the VoSviewer software and the Bibliometrix R-Tool.
    For this purpose, 150 publications from the Scopus International database were
    collected through specific keywords. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
    first study to explore blockchain''s application in FSCs, highlight solutions
    provided by researchers for its successful implementation, and discuss the current
    challenges. Concluding remarks based on the current study are as follows: • Application
    of blockchain in the domain of FSCs appears to be a promising area and has immense
    scope in terms of theoretical as well as practical implementation. Blockchain
    is likely to become a dominant technology for enhancing transparency and traceability,
    reducing risk and, most importantly, enhancing trust among different stakeholders.
    • In a short span of 5–6 years, blockchain has generated considerable interest
    among researchers for its applicability in the domain of FSC, which is evident
    from 150 research papers considered in this study. The growing interest in blockchain
    is also apparent from the fact that research in this field is published in high
    quality journals. As many as 25 journals belonging to Q1 category were identified
    during this study, which published papers related to the implementation of blockchain
    in FSCs. • If we look at the number of researchers country wise, then China has
    the highest number of researchers working in this area, followed by India and
    Italy. Researchers have mostly focused on the applicability of blockchain for
    product authentication, finance, and logistics. • In hindsight, we think that
    most work done with regard to blockchain''s application in FSCs is in the conceptual
    phase and requires proper set-up (including hardware and software facilities)
    for its implementation. Some of the key barriers that deter the implementation
    of this technology, as pointed out by various researchers, include scalability,
    privacy, interoperability, and high cost. 7.1. Future scope and limitations •
    Blockchain is mainly utilized for traceability and transparency in FSCs; however,
    research in the area of application of blockchain from the viewpoint of increasing
    farmers'' income is lacking. This is an interesting area of research which can
    be explored by researchers. • Success of blockchain depends on data that are legitimate
    and requires the development of a sophisticated framework based on sensors, such
    as RFID, IoT, and NFC. Development of such dependable frameworks is the need of
    the hour for a successful blockchain implementation. • Some other issues that
    need research attention are scalability, privacy, and interoperability. • Designing
    a new consensus mechanism that does not necessitate a lot of computing power is
    also an open research domain. In this work, the authors have tried to touch all
    the important aspects of implementation of blockchain technology in the domain
    of FSCs; however, one limitation the paper has is the lack of a detailed study
    on the performance analysis for different blockchain models. This can be taken
    up as a future task when more reports and articles are available in this area.
    It is also pertinent to mention that although the authors made every effort to
    include all necessary references; yet, it is possible that an essential reference
    was overlooked, for which the authors apologize. Authorship contributions Vivekanand

    Conference Location: Omu-Aran, Nigeria SECTION I. Introduction Smart farming utilises
    the idea of precision farming to improve farm yields through accurate knowledge
    and understanding of crop field unpredictability. This entails the examining environmental
    parameters for accurately allocating inputs using the specificity of the farmland
    (or site). In this way, farmers have the opportunity of automating and simplifying
    the procedure of collecting and examining farm data by employing smart farming
    practices. This enables farmers to make speedy, autonomous and intelligent decision-making
    about farming activities [1]. Smart farming are built on modern information and
    communication tools in agricultural value chain known as third green revolution
    [2]. Crop yields are influenced hugely by the farmers'' propensity to arrive at
    quicker and more precise decisions, which are complemented by the correct information
    or knowledge concerning various contiguous factors such as soil condition, weather,
    the precise amount of fertilizer to be applied, sunshine, water-filled property,
    rainfalls, topography and infiltration. Sensors and actuators have the potentials
    to efficiently assist farmer in obtaining environmental and soil factors for faster
    and smarter decisions [3]. The changes in the climatic conditions have negative
    consequences on numerous abiotic factors such as flooding, drought, rainfall,
    temperature, and solar radiation, which are mostly required for crop production
    (such as rice) throughout the phases of growth [4]. Crop information acquired
    from fields is an important tool for present-day farming practice and planning.
    This protects the environment, sustains food production, saves costs, and improves
    decision-making process [5]. IoT integrates billions of Internet-enabled sensors,
    cameras, wearable, displays, smartphones, and others to support exchanges through
    the Internet platform [6]. IoT empowers end-users, everyday Things, and machines
    to sense, communicate and interact with their external world, and increased quality
    of life through wide-ranging applications including smart homes, Industrial IoT,
    Internet of Farming, health, smart city, and others [7]–[9]. Two crucial problems
    are limiting loT-based applications include: insecure ad-hoc exchanges; and the
    inability to establish temporary session keys. Lightweight symmetric cryptography
    is being considered rather than asymmetric cryptography for constrained devices
    because of chip area, code size, energy dissipation, and runtime. But, asymmetric
    cryptography offers better security for applications in real-world scenarios [10].
    The privacy issues are widespread due to the nature and vulnerability of underlying
    IoT networks [7], [11]. Encryption schemes are valuable for safeguarding data
    transmissions and transactions in cloud-based applications (such as Blockchain)
    [12]. IoT has limited computing capacity, low power consumption and low volume,
    which compounds the complexity of implementing reliable cryptographic methods
    available [13]. Reference [10] enlisted the requirements of encryption approaches
    appropriate for IoT including: single execution per session, shorter keys and
    reduced size of codes, faster encryption, key generation and decryption operations
    as well as hardware implementation considerations. In this paper, two encryption
    modes based on hybrid cryptographic algorithms were investigated to ascertain
    their level of privacy guarantees for smart farming systems. The remaining sections
    of this paper are planned as follows: section two provides the review of the literature,
    the proposed scheme is outlined in section three, section four discusses the results,
    and section five is the conclusion. A. Research Issue and Objectives This paper
    develops a secure lightweight cryptographic scheme for smart farming devices.
    The main objectives include: To develop hybrid scheme (SHA-AES) based on two strong
    traditional cryptographic schemes (AES256 and SHA1-256). To increase the security
    of SHA-AES scheme with CBC and GCM hardening algorithms. To compare the performances
    of SHA-AES scheme based on CBC and GCM using key size, encryption (key generation)
    time, and decryption time. SECTION II. Literature Review A. Security Outlook of
    Smart Farming Systems The speedy developments of IoT technology has facilitated
    tangible and intangible values to be entrusted in its networks including physical
    assets, and digitally sensitive data [14]. The processes of collecting data, storing
    data and utilizing data are prone to privacy glitches in case of big data, IoT
    and cloud computing technologies. The preserving privacy of cloud data remains
    promising open area of research [15]. In cloud, data storage and transactions
    are highly susceptible to fraud due to lack of transparency among parties, corruption
    and mismanagement within distributed ledger databases and centralized storage
    architectures [16]. In case of IoT, its devices, links, channels, computation,
    storage and microservices re susceptible to attacks [17]. Wireless technology
    underpins IoT, which foster real-time collaborations for highly sophisticated
    applications in areas of military, precision monitoring, remote monitoring, commercial,
    smart home and others. Security of IoT is worsening due to trust and malicious
    tendencies within the Internet connectivity. Also, the physical features of IoT
    (including computational, power, transmission range and short-leaved memory) have
    constrained existing security solutions [18]. Another conventional approach for
    securing IoT networks is Public Private Key Infrastructure systems. Though, it
    is incapable of meeting the centralized authority peculiarity for public key validation,
    leading to exploitations and one-point of failure [14]. Elliptic Curve Digital
    Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) initiated the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for
    open-source schemes and Internet-based applications. ECDSA offers a high rate
    of security due to its capability to calculate a point multiplication without
    reversing (or computing the multiplicand with original and product points). It
    is public key cryptography and deployed for Bitcoin (that is, private and public
    keys generations) and secure communications, critical infrastructure, protected
    Internet exchanges, smart devices, and Wireless Fidelity [19]. Recently, public
    blockchain technology was introduced for safeguarding privacy of IoT data. But,
    several shortcomings have been highlighted such as large bandwidth, extended computation,
    latency and restricted scalability [20], [21]. Blockchain-based security approaches
    could target IoT''s network edge (local level) and the physical hardware/software
    levels [17]. While middleware software-oriented architectures allow interoperability
    of dissimilar IoT and blockchain technologies [22]. B. Related Works The modes
    of encryption schemes necessitate public or private keys and encrypted messages
    to be broadcast among participants through network links. Privacy leaks and compromises
    could happen in the process. The growth of untrusted servers, cloud operators
    and providers have further compounded anonymization problems. It became possible
    to retain, manipulate and link users'' transactions to their identity in a long
    run. Homomorphic Encryption (HE) is capable of dealing with trust issues caused
    by third-party manipulation of users'' data encrypted in the cloud because decryption
    is near impossible [23]. A hybrid of HE and public keys-based traditional encryptions
    allows direct operations on ciphertexts. Data broadcasts, retrieval, storage and
    aggregation can be privacy-protected with HE especially in cloud and wireless
    sensor networks. HE in itself alone cannot guarantee privacy preservation but,
    it could conceal data and increase confidentiality of ciphertexts [24], [25].
    The outsourced data privacy preservation for user-specific services was undertaken
    by [26]. A new security solution combined labelled homomorphic encryption, and
    FEET algorithms to build HIKE lightweight protocol. HIKE provides secure and private
    safekeeping, computation, and non-disclosure of users'' data. It is a weak against
    malicious server attacks. Reference [27] utilized fully HE in blended operation
    model, which executes blended arithmetic operations on the cloud in a less complicated
    manner, not without overheads. Reference [28] proposed lightweight stream encryption
    algorithms (LWSE) with a shuffling process on the plain image before encryption.
    The modified LWSE offered better security for embedded hardware (ARM7 core) and
    real-time applications with shorter execution time, and code size. Data encryption
    within IoT networks imposes timing overheads, which is undesirable regardless
    of the security benefits. Richards et al. [29] demonstrated that, utilizing 128-bit
    key size for Cipher-Block Chaining (CBC) encryption was 1.24 times longer as Counter
    (CTR), and 2.54 times later as Electronic Codebook (ECB). It follows that, longer
    key sizes (such as 192 and 256-bits) produced longer data encryption timing. IoT
    advances and applications have unmatched security efforts towards their processes
    and exchanges. The mode of data harvesting through them has many implications
    on the privacy of users [30]. Lightweight cryptography and dynamic keys were taunted
    to protect exchanges between IoT and servers. Lightweight encryption algorithms
    provide scalable key size, simpler architecture, number of rounds, and block sizes.
    But, these are less secure, unsafe or moderate requiring extra perfections to
    avert security threats [11]. Reference [31] planned a lightweight data privacy-preserving
    aggregation method (that is, Chinese Remainder Theorem, Homomorphic Paillier encryption,
    and one-way hash chain) for fog computing-based Things. This method aggregates
    data with early recognition of injected false data attacks at network edge. Aside
    differential privacy attained; simplified communication overheads and low-cost
    derivations were observed. IoT facilitates exchanges among constrained objects,
    low resources, process computation regulation and decision-making [11]. Though,
    few challenges were acknowledged such as storage capacity, cost of performance,
    security, smaller battery, and large energy dissipation [32]. The quest to maintain
    the confidentiality of IoT devices is desirable because of enormous data generated
    and exchanged across them. But, traditional cryptosystems (such as AES and DES)
    offered varying security solutions whose ciphers structures are unfitted for resource-constrained
    devices [33]. The security and privacy of data from smart systems are problematic
    during gathering, integration, storage, and transformation of data in fulfilling
    the needs of agri-food sector and its players. Hence, some forms of data governance
    are expected for production control systems. Reference [34] proposed an extension
    mushroom farm decentralized process control system based on Blockchain and IoT
    for improving environmental factors gathering; thereby supplementing autonomous
    production control system. The lack of precise data and exchanges adversely hampers
    farm management and production. To this end, Reference [35] suggested the use
    of IoT in place of conservative farming practice to increase monitoring of farming
    activities, farm and farmers'' well-being through unlimited data access. The prospects
    of IoT in advancing the agricultural sector to deliver food to over 9.6 billion
    world population by 2050 were highlighted in [36]. To enable farmers to cope with
    massive demands for produce, IoT-based smart farming. Though, the overall architecture;
    processes and requirements for smart farming left out data privacy of underlying
    IoT devices and less-secure public networks exchanges. In rural setups, wireless
    networks, and fog computing have the propensity of linking dispersed farm bases
    [37]. To improve the efficiency, sensing, latency, and actuating of this technique,
    a simplified network arrangement for monitoring and controlling farms locally
    was developed using a cross-layer routing and channel access scheme. Nevertheless,
    there are greater risks of data manipulation, and tampering. SECTION III. The
    Proposed Scheme This paper proposes a hybrid scheme of two strongest cryptographic
    schemes (AES256 and SHA1-256) used commonly for resource-constrained devices [28],
    [38], which is known as SHA-AES. The ECB and GCM encryption modes are widely used
    to increase Hamming distance of ciphers and security status (complexity, diffusion
    state, and confusion state). The hardening schemes of HE, Blowfish, and base64encode
    are used to fortify the resultant cryptographic algorithms. The performances of
    both encryption modes based on encryption algorithms are measured using speed
    and memory complexities. The agricultural sensor datasets for the study were sourced
    from the University of Califonia, Irvine. The optimal experimental setup for validating
    the proposed lightweight cryptographic scheme as shown in Table 1. Table I. The
    minimal experimental settings SECTION IV. Discussion of Results The validation
    of the proposed hybrid encryption with a hardening algorithm composed of high-performing
    cryptographic primitives of AES256 and SHA1-256 schemes. Two forms of hardening
    procedures were introduced (that is, CBC and GCM) whose outcomes are presented
    in Tables II and III. Table II. The performance of cbc-based sha-aes scheme Table
    III. The performance of gcm-based sha-aes scheme From Tables II and III, the average
    performances of both encryption modes applied to the proposed SHA-AES schemes
    in preserving the privacy of smart farming systems are illustrated in Fig. 1.
    Fig. 1. The performance of sha-aes scheme evaluated. Show All From Fig. 1, the
    CBC-based SHA-AES scheme was best in terms of speed of encryption (8.34%) and
    decryption (43.42%) as well as memory consumption for secret key sizes (50.00%)
    and ciphertext sizes (26.88%) when compared to GCM approach. The security provided
    by GCM was the highest though, ineffective for protecting resources-constrained
    devices used to power smart farming systems. More so, the comparative analysis
    of the SHA-AES (CBC) against ECC, and ECDSA in terms of encryption time. These
    revealed that, the proposed SHA-AES (CBC) scheme significantly offers faster key
    generation time (1689.25 s) against SHA-AES (GCM) (18090.63 s), ECC (16622.61
    s) and ECDSA (11110.95 s) as shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 2. The performance of sha-aes
    against existing schemes. Show All SECTION V. Conclusion This paper underscored
    the numerous potentials of IoT and associated wireless technologies in supporting
    smart farming processes around the world. Nevertheless, several factors have been
    identified as impacting the effectiveness of these technologies including low
    technical know-how, lack of required settings, insecurity of channels, energy
    consumption, scalability, efficiency, hardware constraints, low resource devices,
    large process requirements, and ineffective security solutions (such as encryption
    procedures). The topmost issue inhibiting IoT usage in farming is privacy, which
    is further compounded by hardware and software constraints. The quest to make
    encryption solutions relevant for IoT-based systems brings on stronger lightweight
    cryptography schemes to the interests of academics [39], [40]. Though, lightweight
    cryptography schemes are weak and susceptible to attacks and breaches, encryption
    modes, hybrid encryption algorithms, and hardening procedures could raise security
    status (that is, complexity, diffusion state, and confusion state) [40], [41].
    The results obtained revealed the superiority of CBC based SHA-AES scheme over
    GCM encryption modes in terms of speed and memory complexities. In the future,
    more lightweight cryptosystems can be developed using the proposed approach to
    protect the privacy of smart farming. Particularly, the memory consumption and
    time taken can be minimised by generating shorter secret key sizes to target resource-constrained
    devices. ACKNOWLEDGMENT This research is partially sponsored by the Confluence

  description: 'This review examines literature from 2011 to 2020 on information and
    communications technologies (ICTs) and blockchain technologies (BTs) in agriculture.
    To describe the status of the subjects and identify issues for future research,
    we utilized bibliometric and content analyses of leading journals. The main findings
    are: (1) ICT technique adoption is affected by application design and socio-demographic
    factors, while research in BTs in this area only focuses on application design
    factors; (2) ICTs and BTs have similar applications in agricultural production
    (information provision for efficient decisions and production improvement), logistics
    (tracing), and supply chain (trust-building); (3) ICT techniques are applied more
    to production improvement, while BTs focus more on using visibility, traceability,
    and automation to improve transparency and transaction efficiency in whole sectors;
    (4) in relation to consumption, ICTs focus on balancing supply and demand to achieve
    market stability, while BTs investigate effects on consumer purchasing decisions.
    Insights are also proposed for future research based on common challenges in the
    application of ICT and blockchain in agriculture in the following areas: (i) security
    and privacy protection; (ii) solutions for scalability and interoperability; (iii)
    solutions for high cost and high consumption, and demands for high knowledge in
    technology application; (iv) formulation of policies and regulations related to
    standard criteria for market stability. This review provides a basis for studying
    the combination of ICTs and BTs in agriculture and furthers the understanding
    of their usage by comparison; this has significant implications for technological

    (BTs) in agriculture. To describe the status of the subjects and identify issues
    for future research, we utilized bibliometric and content analyses of leading
    journals. The main findings are: (1) ICT technique adoption is affected by application
    design and socio-demographic factors, while research in BTs in this area only
    focuses on application design factors; (2) ICTs and BTs have similar applications
    in agricultural production (information provision for efficient decisions and
    production improvement), logistics (tracing), and supply chain (trust-building);
    (3) ICT techniques are applied more to production improvement, while BTs focus
    more on using visibility, traceability, and automation to improve transparency
    and transaction efficiency in whole sectors; (4) in relation to consumption, ICTs
    focus on balancing supply and demand to achieve market stability, while BTs investigate
    effects on consumer purchasing decisions. Insights are also proposed for future
    research based on common challenges in the application of ICT and blockchain in
    agriculture in the following areas: (i) security and privacy protection; (ii)
    solutions for scalability and interoperability; (iii) solutions for high cost
    and high consumption, and demands for high knowledge in technology application;
    (iv) formulation of policies and regulations related to standard criteria for
    market stability. This review provides a basis for studying the combination of
    ICTs and BTs in agriculture and furthers the understanding of their usage by comparison;
    this has significant implications for technological development and agricultural
    sustainability. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Bibliometric

    efficiency 1. Introduction Studies on information and communications technology
    (ICT)-based e-agriculture have shown great improvements in practice, such as access
    to effective information (Das and Solanki, 2005), support for decision making
    (Rao, 2007), and increased productivity (Eitzinger et al., 2019). Additionally,
    innovation and progress in blockchain technologies (BTs) have changed the information
    technology sector worldwide (Wang et al., 2020). Due to the outstanding decentralization
    and security features of BTs, researchers, engineers, and technicians have been
    keen to develop BT and its application in wider areas such as agricultural production
    (Ai et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2019; Ma and Tsai, 2017; Ma et al., 2018; Mo et
    al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020), purchasing decisions, supply chain management
    (Chang et al., 2019) and Internet of Things (Hamidi and Jahanshahifard, 2018;
    Lin et al., 2017; Mistry et al., 2020; Parada et al., 2018; Reddy et al., 2018;
    Singh and Agrawal, 2018). However, in real-world setting, e-agriculture is hindered
    by ICT limitations such are human biases, uncertainties, and lack of transparency
    and trust. A combination of ICTs and BTs could overcome these limitations, and
    thereby expand the applications of ICTs. In addition, existing studies have focused
    on ICT-based agriculture or blockchain-based farming separately; studies on the
    combined application of ICTs and BTs in agriculture are limited, resulting in
    a lack of understanding of their applications. It is of great interest to understand
    how BTs could be implemented with ICTs to enhance transparency and trust among
    actors, increase transaction efficiency, and facilitate precision e-agriculture
    schemes (Khan and Salah, 2018; Leng et al., 2018; Yli-Huumo et al., 2016). Similar
    barriers in ICTs and BTs have hampered the adoption of these technologies, thereby
    slowing down the development of precision agriculture. It is important to identify
    the success of ICTs and BTs in agriculture, as well as current challenges. There
    is a growing need for advanced technologies that can consolidate the existing
    scenarios (such as information acquisition, yield prediction, and product tracking),
    address present problems (such as privacy protection and high cost), and enhance
    smart agriculture for improved sustainability. To address this gap, this paper
    presents a systematic review of ICTs and BTs in e-agriculture, which contributes
    to the literature of precision agriculture in two ways. First, we review and synthesize
    the literature of these two technological applications in the agricultural sector.
    This enables us to identify the distinctiveness of each technological application
    and compile a comprehensive understanding of relations between ICTs and BTs. Second,
    we demonstrate possible avenues for research to (1) conduct comparative investigations
    of these techniques in precision agriculture; (2) study interactive effects of
    factors indicated in previous literature; (3) consider the heterogeneity of regions
    in terms of technological applications. The rest of the paper is organized as
    follows: section 2 discusses our research methodology and processes for collecting
    relevant research papers; section 3 introduces the bibliometric results of the
    collected research papers; section 4 presents the outcomes of content analysis,
    which include ICT and blockchain services, along with common challenges in e-agriculture;
    section 5 provides opportunities for future study; and section 6 concludes the
    paper. 2. Research methods This systematic review on ICTs and BTs in agriculture
    includes both bibliometric and content analyses. The combination of bibliometric
    analysis with content analysis was designed to identify the most frequent topics
    and informational gaps (Carvalho et al., 2013). The analysis processes have been
    shown in Fig. 1. Specifically, in this study, the ISI Web of Science database
    was used for sample collection. The search criteria were set as follows: (1) topics;
    “agriculture” and “ICT,” (2) periods; from 2011 to 2020, (3) filtering paper types;
    as “Article” and “Review.” This search identified 146 papers. Using the same measures,
    we searched and found 26 articles in the area of blockchain and agriculture. Then,
    we supplemented relevant literature, making the final samples 156 and 44 articles
    on ICT and BT, respectively. Download : Download high-res image (564KB) Download

    analysis quantified the publications related to our topic (Ikpaahindi, 1985).
    During the bibliometric analysis process, we employed descriptive statistics,
    which shows the number of publications during the decade (Fig. 2.1 and Fig. 2.2).
    Additionally, we utilized CiteSpace software (Chen, 2006) to conduct the co-citation
    of journals and references during the period (Chai and Xiao, 2012). This Co-citation
    analysis identified the most influential journals (Fig. 3.1 and Fig. 3.2) and
    the evolution of the most important theories (Fig. 4.1 and Fig. 4.2), which involved
    six articles on ICT and five on BT. The content analysis process included several
    phases. First, we employed CiteSpace software (Chen, 2006) to analyze keywords
    based on the frequency. Second, keyword clusters were used to assist in finding
    original research topics (Fig. 5.2.1 and Fig. 5.3.1). Third, the abstracts were
    reviewed to confirm relevance. Fourth, perspectives of industrial chains and effect
    relations were utilized to construct a complete understanding (Fig. 5.1). These
    phases involved 38 articles on ICT and 20 on BT. These articles offered important
    insights into how applications of ICT and BT improve precision agriculture. Download

    3. Bibliometric findings 3.1. Journals and year of publication Research on ICT-based
    agriculture gyrated up from 2011 to 2020 (Fig. 2.1). The division of the reviewed
    articles per publication year illustrates that 2016, 2018, and 2019 were outstanding
    dates for research on ICT-based agriculture. In terms of the publications in blockchain-based
    agriculture, although the retrieval period is from 2011 to 2020, the articles
    related to blockchain and agriculture first appeared in 2018. Beginning with a
    very finite number of articles, the number of the reviewed articles shows a rise
    since 2018 (Fig. 2.2), in particular, a significant increase in 2019. Drawing
    on the co-reference analysis, by setting citation thresholds, we found the most
    influential journals in the areas of ICT- and blockchain-based agriculture. Their
    degree of influence can be seen by the size of circles in the figures below. The
    high impact journals in ICT are shown in Fig. 3.1 and include: Agricultural Economics,
    Computers And Electronics In Agriculture, and Agricultural Systems. Various journals
    having high impact in blockchain and agriculture fields are shown in Fig. 3.2
    and include: Food Control, Future Generation Computer Systems, and Computers And
    Electronics In Agriculture. Clearly, Computers And Electronics In Agriculture
    have similarly high effects in both areas (Fig. 3.1, Fig. 3.2). 3.2. Main scholars
    and theoretical evolution The network shown in Fig. 4.1 demonstrates that the
    discussion of ICT in agriculture continually changes. Aker, J. C. (2011) reviewed
    existing programs using ICT for agriculture and categorized these programs into
    four mechanisms: voice, text, internet, and mobile money transfers through which
    ICT can facilitate agricultural adoption. Later articles mainly focused on mobile
    phones and their effects on agricultural development. Fafchamps and Minten (2012)
    emphasized its benefits in delivering market and weather information to farmers.
    Nakasone et al. (2014) further investigated the effects at the macro and micro
    levels. At the macro level, access to mobile phones can improve market performance,
    whereas they have mixed effects at the micro-level. From 2015 onward, differentiated
    research focused on the dual effects of mobile phones in agriculture. Aker and
    Fafchamps (2015) specifically discussed the beneficial impacts of mobile phone
    coverage on the reduction of spatial producer price dispersion of semi-perishable
    commodities. Although farmers increasingly utilized mobile phones for marketing
    decisions, according to Tadesse and Bahiigwa (2015), a lack of relevant information
    access inhibited the usage of mobile phones. Besides, Aker and Ksoll (2016) found
    that mobile phone coverage did not increase crop sales or farm-gate prices. The
    evolution of discussion about blockchain-based agriculture is shown in Fig. 4.2.
    Aung and Chang (2014) comprehensively explained traceability and its benefits
    in the food supply chain but did not mention blockchain applications in this field.
    Tse et al. (2017) introduced the blockchain concept and its applications in food
    supply information security. Galvez et al. (2018) and Kshetri (2018) examined
    the benefits of BTs in the supply chain. The former study found that blockchain
    can assure traceability and authenticity in the food supply chain through data
    acquisition and management, while the latter study showed that blockchain applications
    could increase transparency and accountability. Tripoli and Schmidhuber (2018)
    comprehensively discussed the benefits and barriers of applying blockchain in
    the agri-food industry. 4. Content analysis: research streams and opportunities
    This analysis was conducted as follows—after analyzing the keyword network and
    keyword clusters, to find research streams, we: (1) reviewed influences on ICT
    and BT adoption, as technique usage is the prerequisite of precision agriculture;
    (2) analyzed how ICT and BT promote precision agriculture development within the
    agricultural industry supply chain at macro levels; and (3) discussed relationships
    between variables, based on extant quantitative literature at the micro levels.
    4.1. ICT technology in agriculture We identified three dominant research streams:
    factors affecting ICT adoption, ICT application in agricultural production, and
    ICT application in agricultural networks. The findings are summarized in Fig.
    5.2.3, and the main findings are listed in Table 2.1.1 and Table 2.1.2. Table

    factors influence the utilization of ICT-based devices in agriculture, including
    socio-demographic, farm, and application design factors. Socio-demographic factors
    are heterogeneous and include age, innovativeness, income and asset levels, degree
    of risk perception, educational level, and usage awareness. Older farmers are
    less likely to adopt the mobile internet than younger farmers (Michels et al.,
    2020; Rose et al., 2016). Additionally, more innovative farmers are more likely
    to adopt the mobile internet (Michels et al., 2020). Farmers under comfortable
    economic circumstances and less sensitive to risks are more likely to adopt ICT-based
    applications than those with a lower income and fewer productive assets (Oyinbo
    et al., 2020). Agronomists and growers with a higher education level access the
    internet more frequently (Rose et al., 2016; Wright et al., 2018). Farmers who
    recognize the usefulness of ICT tools tend to adopt the technology (Khatri-Chhetri
    et al., 2019; Mittal and Hariharan, 2018). In terms of farm elements, farmers
    of larger farms are more likely to adopt the mobile internet (Michels et al.,
    2020; Rose et al., 2016). Geographical location could be considered a proxy for
    internet access. It correlates with mobile internet adoption (Michels et al.,
    2020), and the collection of data varies among farm types (Rose et al., 2016).
    Furthermore, application design factors also influence the adoption of ICT-based
    devices. The usage of ICT-based tools is promoted by system development (Hochman
    and Carberry, 2011) and user-friendly features such as language, interface, ease-of-use,
    and information accuracy (Oyinbo et al., 2019). According to Hudson et al. (2017),
    interactivity in discussion groups and feedback to extension agents could increase
    knowledge and willingness to adopt certain practices. Participatory strategies
    including the use of interactive ICTs can help engage audiences, increase knowledge
    of agricultural improvements and innovations, and promote the adoption of ICT-based
    tools. These could be highly relevant for increasing awareness and adopting new
    agricultural practices. 4.1.2. ICT application in agricultural production: monitoring,
    information provision, and forecast There are three ICT-based applications used
    to improve farming, including monitoring agricultural practices, information provision,
    and forecasting; these are discussed below and in Table 2.1.2. ICT-based surveillance
    is critical for precision agriculture; it provides specific information to farmers
    to facilitate better practices. For example, Caceres et al. (2017) used online
    instruments that detected particular ions to monitor the performance of a constructed
    wetland; this real-time data were shared with end-users through a web app, allowing
    others to manage wetlands more effectively. Remote sensing (RS) technologies are
    used to monitor crop growth, moisture conditions, and water consumption, enabling
    farmers to provide water to crops in the right place, at the right time, and in
    appropriate quantities, in response to anticipated water stress and likely delays
    to harvesting (Amarnath et al., 2018). In addition to monitoring information,
    rural households can access other production-related information, thus improving
    their knowledge, production planning, and practical decisions about what types
    of crops are planted (e.g. Radoglou-Grammatikis et al., 2020). Kaila and Tarp
    (2019) found that internet access is associated with a higher yield because of
    more efficient fertilizer usage. Water management is yet another focus area where
    such information can be utilized. The ICT-based FieldLook platform can share flood
    information with farmers; consequently, they can store water, operate spate-irrigation
    systems, and plan growing activities in advance (Amarnath et al., 2018). An information
    system within the wireless sensor network (WSN) and ICT is beneficial for inspecting
    agricultural irrigation facilities by downloading, collecting, and updating real-time
    data (Nam et al., 2017). Combining ICT with other tools such as big data and prediction
    models can also improve process decisions and market demand perception to achieve
    precision agriculture. Perea et al. (2019) developed a new tool that will help
    irrigation district managers in their daily decision making relating to water
    and energy use. The results show that the developed model improved the prediction
    accuracy between 3% and 11%. Simultaneously, employing a sliding window-based
    support vector regression (multi-modal SW-SVR) method, Kaneda et al. (2017) proposed
    a novel multi-model for accurately predicting complex water stress situations.
    In another example of the use of the model for water management, Godara and Toshniwal
    (2020) built prediction systems to forecast problems for Indian farmers. 4.1.3.
    ICTs in agricultural networks: functions in other segments of the industrial chain,
    and re-creating networks There is minimal research on the application of ICT in
    logistics and consumption compared to ICT application in production. In logistics,
    ICT technologies are applied to product tracking and monitoring, such as movements
    and environmental impacts (Lehmann et al., 2012), while for consumption, efficient
    markets are the goal that ICTs can help to realize. The use of information and
    services can help to implement postharvest management and marketing (Ali and Kumar,
    2011). Dube et al. (2020) found that ICT applications can increase consumption.
    By drawing on price information provided by a third-party, farmers can match supply
    and demand, thereby reducing geographic price dispersion (Parker et al., 2016).
    Another significant role of ICTs in agriculture is to create collaborations and
    alliances (Vallauri, 2014). Aimed at empowerment, enablement, and market expansion,
    measures have been taken by state governments and private organizations to improve
    ICT for agricultural extension (Lele and Goswami, 2017). Actors (NGOs, broadcasters,
    technology providers, agricultural partners, and government agencies) in the value
    chain collaborate for providing cultivation and market information to smallholders
    (Dong et al., 2020; Karanasios and Slavova, 2019; Shao et al., 2020; Yang et al.,
    2019)). Digital Platform (DP) is an example of a tool that generates new networks
    and forms of cooperation in the value chain of maize crops, and it helps to initiate
    an entry point for recalibrating trust perceptions (Agyekumhene et al., 2018).
    ICTs introduce transparency that strengthens trust and allows farmers to renegotiate
    existing relationships (Slavova and Karanasios, 2018). 4.2. Blockchain technology
    (BT) in agriculture Blockchain is a distributed knowledge system incorporating
    six components: consensus algorithm, network model, CAP theorem (consistency,
    availability, and tolerance of partitions), smart contracts, interplanetary file
    system, and security analysis (Prashar et al., 2020), which can provide the digital
    infrastructure for a wide array of applications relevant to sustainable development
    (Bierbaum et al., 2020). Using the same methods described in 4.1, we found three
    dominant research themes in the area of blockchain-based agriculture: the effect
    of factors on BT implementation, applications of BT in the holistic supply chain,
    and applications of BT in every segment of the agricultural supply chain. As Fig.
    5.3.1 shows, keywords and clusters demonstrate major research directions. Final
    research themes with details are listed in Fig. 5.3.2, Table 2.2.1 and Table 2.2.2.

    4.2.1. Influences on BT implementation As BT is still in its early stages of development,
    we found only one study (Kamble et al., 2020a) on the effects of BT implementation
    on the agricultural industry. The authors found that traceability, provenance,
    immutability, and auditability are the main areas of agricultural practice where
    BTs can be applied. Traceability allows any information to be traced back via
    the timestamp. Provenance is maintained because BT creates a unique fingerprint
    (a digital token) for each of the products at different stages, allowing products
    to be traced back to their origins. Immutability refers to unchanging features
    that provide an immutable audit trail and reduce susceptibility to manipulation
    or forgery of data. In terms of auditability, the decentralized database of BT
    makes transactions visible to its participants, thus maintaining an audit trail
    and increasing auditability. 4.2.2. Applications of blockchain in the holistic
    supply chain Most extant articles focus on traceability and visibility, which
    can increase transparency. Other articles emphasize the automation of blockchain
    applications in the supply chain, which improves efficiency. 4.2.2.1. Realization
    mechanisms of traceability, visibility, and automation: shared ledgers and smart
    contracts Building a decentralized network requires a shared ledger. As a distributed
    ledger technology, BT can leverage its potential to achieve the synchronization,
    sharing, and visibility of tracking information (Chang et al., 2019). Blockchains
    comprise data records; as each transaction occurs, it is put into a block that
    is connected to the one before and after it. In a blockchain, the entire dataset
    is visible to all parties. Each party can verify the transaction records of the
    partners directly. The verification process can effectively secure data on blockchain
    ledgers against unauthorized access or manipulation (Wang et al., 2019a). The
    smart contract is the computer code that can operate on the blockchain platform
    to construct agreements and promptly track changes in process status among suppliers,
    manufacturers, logistics service providers, distributors, and customers. Specifically,
    supply chain participants share their ledgers via blockchain systems. A smart
    contract can then complete transactions automatically upon fulfillment of contract
    conditions (Hang et al., 2020) and track status changes. Through the mutual registration
    of dual participants on smart contracts, all participants can track status changes
    (Chang et al., 2019). 4.2.2.2. Outcomes of traceability, visibility, and automation
    Traceability and visibility secure information authenticity, improve transparency
    and information security, and also build trust. The goal of traceability is to
    verify the origins and processes of items, as well as to present tamper-proof
    information to all stakeholders in the supply chain (Prashar et al., 2020). BT
    can trace items at different points of processing or packaging, enhancing trade
    transparency (Rao et al., 2019; Zhao et al., 2019). For example, WasteLedger has
    applied blockchain and artificial intelligence technologies to track waste products
    throughout the entire supply chain, while Earth Bank of Codes was developed to
    trace genetic resources (Bierbaum et al., 2020). Visibility can promote product
    traceability from producers to end-users, improving trust among all members of
    the supply chain (Wang et al., 2019b). Trust is gradually embedded in the blockchain
    technological platform as traceability and visibility are increased, thus enhancing
    relationships between supply chain partners (Bumblauskas et al., 2020; Wang et
    al., 2019b). It is efficient to improve the potential for synchronization and
    automation of operational processes using smart contracts in a multi-agent system
    to manage the entire supply chain process (Chang et al., 2019). This is because
    smart contracts remove intermediaries and are programmed to activate commencements
    of subsequent processes such as payment transactions. Through the proper deployment
    of such contracts, labor forces can be more-or-less replaced or transformed to
    achieve automatic execution of the process. This can reduce costs and time associated
    with queries and confirmation in the transit process and accelerate the data exchange
    among parties (Wang et al., 2019b), thereby improving efficiency in agricultural
    supply chains (Mistry et al., 2020; Shao et al., 2020). 4.2.3. Applications of
    BT in every segment of agriculture 4.2.3.1. Application of blockchain in information
    provision BT application contributes to data collection, exchange, and analysis,
    which supports small farmers in decision making, thereby improving productivity
    and sustainability. By using BTs, practitioners can acquire information regarding
    factors including crops, pesticides, fertilizers, machinery, weather conditions,
    animals, and financial transactions (Kamilaris et al., 2019; Su et al., 2020).
    This real-time information and analysis can enable data-driven decision making
    and improve the quality and quantity of resultant agricultural products, thereby
    contributing to agricultural productivity and sustainability (Mistry et al., 2020;
    Sharma et al., 2020). For example, the Smart Watering System using the blockchain
    and Fuzzy Logic approach can help farmers capture objective data from plants and
    the environment that can be used to make effective decisions about optimal watering
    schedules (Munir et al., 2019). 4.2.3.2. Applications of blockchain in logistics
    and consumption As for logistics, the main role of BT is similar to its role in
    the supply chain: increase traceability and transparency. BTs can help users to
    acquire information about shipping details, trajectories, storage conditions (e.g.,
    temperature and humidity), and time in transit (Astill et al., 2019; Kamilaris
    et al., 2019), all of which increase transparency in the transaction process (Astill
    et al., 2019). With regard to consumption, consumers can use a mobile phone to
    scan the QR code (a matrix two-dimensional code symbol) to ascertain details associated
    with the food item, such as quality and quantity, expiration dates, storage conditions,
    and time spent on the shelf. This enables consumers to obtain fair pricing and
    increases their perception of quality related to purchasing decisions (Kamilaris
    et al., 2019; Sander et al., 2018, Fig. 5.3.2). 5. Discussion Through our comparison
    of ICT- and blockchain-based agriculture and its challenges, we have identified
    opportunities for future academic research; these are presented in Fig. 6 and

    is in the ICT or BT area. 2. × represents this challenge is not in the ICT or
    BT area. 5.1. Possible future research - based on a comparison of applications
    5.1.1. Influences on technology adoption As for factors affecting ICT adoption,
    socio-demographic and design factors can have an effect on whether practitioners
    choose to use these applications in agricultural practice (see section 4.1.1).
    A single study (Kamble et al., 2020a) on BT usage illustrates technologically
    relevant factors such as traceability, auditability, immutability, and provenance
    (see section 4.2.1); these can help designers prioritize certain functions when
    designing applications. Referring to factors affecting ICT adoption, future research
    on BT adoption should consider socio-demographic factors and other design elements.
    Socio-demographic factors include age, income and asset levels, degree of risk
    perception, educational level, and usage awareness, while design elements include
    language, interface, ease-of-use, and information accuracy. 5.1.2. Technological
    applications in agriculture ICT and BT have similar applications in the fields
    of production and logistics within agriculture. In the area of production, ICT
    and BT can provide farmers with information, which can improve their decision
    making and promote productivity. In logistics, product tracing is the main function
    of ICT- and BT-based applications. Our review investigations have shown that there
    is little research on the applications of ICT and BT in distribution (retailing)
    areas. Hence, future studies could investigate how ICT and BT impact distribution
    in the agricultural sector. Having considered the similarities in the roles above,
    there are differences between these two technological applications. For example,
    in relation to consumption, ICT focuses on market efficiency, with extant articles
    considering how to maximize the balance of supply and demand to reduce price dispersion.
    Whereas in consumption research, BT is applied to show product details that consumers
    depend on for decisions; however, there is little discussion about which factors
    influence purchasing decisions, and this is an opportunity for future research.
    Another difference is in the functions of ICT and BT in the whole supply chain.
    ICT is more focused on production improvements, while BT emphasizes transparency
    (trust) and automation (efficiency). Despite little research on ICT in trust-building,
    trust plays a crucial role in relationships among actors in the supply chain.
    Further research should investigate influential factors on trust-building among
    stakeholders. BT smart contracts promote trust-building and collaboration automatically,
    which creates efficiency improvements and benefits the whole industry; future
    research could address the impacts of automation realization, from social and
    technological perspectives. 5.2. Opportunities based on challenges 5.2.1. Challenges
    of ICT-based agriculture Bacco et al. (2019) and Chae and Cho (2018) found that
    data ownership, protection, and security do not meet the demand of farmers. More
    specifically, digital solutions for precision agriculture are under-utilized as
    farmers are afraid of data misuse and the loss of control over their businesses.
    Insufficient infrastructure is another challenge, which impacts the speed of moving
    raw data from cloud platforms to closer computation platforms such as edge computing.
    Additionally, there is an urban-rural digital divide in terms of internet and
    broadband access. This is a crucial inhibitor to edge computation that supports
    interoperability and scalability (O’Grady et al., 2019). To solve problems of
    interoperability, Kruize et al. (2016) use a design-oriented research approach
    to develop a reference architecture in Software Ecosystem (SE) that can fulfill
    the following integration requirements: data handling and exchange, flexible configuration
    (e.g., customized ICT), interoperability, and organizational collaboration. However,
    by comparing the proposed SE to real-world farm SE, they found that the real-world
    scenario did not reflect the conditions necessary for configuration, and ideas
    of how this inconsistency should be handled are not yet well-developed. In addition,
    the relationships between SE and edge computation are unclear. Socioeconomic barriers
    also inhibit the diffusion of precision agriculture. Although adoption costs have
    decreased gradually, cost issues still keep farmers from considering ICT-based
    techniques (Aker, J. C., 2011; Bacco et al., 2019; Hudson et al., 2017; Lele and
    Goswami, 2017; Varghese and Buyya, 2018). Farmers are concerned about investment
    recovery time and difficulties of utilization (Bacco et al., 2019). Therefore,
    incentives and policies will play a significant role in facilitating technology
    improvement and alleviating socioeconomic issues. Financial and non-financial
    incentives, such as training, are influential solutions (Bacco et al., 2019);
    governments could take responsibility for introducing uniform data standards to
    offer exclusive cross-manufacturer and cross-platform applications (Munz et al.,
    2020). 5.2.2. Challenges of blockchain-based agriculture Concerns about the application
    of blockchain are the privacy of users and data security (Zhao et al., 2019).
    There are potentially hacking risks of devices embedded into agricultural supply
    chains, which could result in either illegally-collected data or manipulated device
    function (Astill et al., 2019). As it is, the information on the blockchain is
    available to all the participants who belong to the blockchain network (Leng et
    al., 2018; Lezoche et al., 2020). In the agri-food value chain, members are in
    competitive relationships and do not value the transparent traceability system.
    Scalability is another challenge that relates to latency (Lezoche et al., 2020;
    Zhao et al., 2019). To provide theoretically proven security, it is necessary
    to have a large number of full nodes that validate each transaction in the blockchain
    (Reyna et al., 2018). As the blockchain size constantly grows, an oversized chain
    has negative effects on performance because it increases the synchronization time.
    Also, the number of transactions and time between blocks influence the computational
    power and transaction confirmation times. A latency issue is incurred in the transaction
    capacity of blockchain, which is restricted to seven transactions per second;
    thus, the time processing transactions increases (Reyna et al., 2018). The high
    cost, high consumption, and high knowledge demands of blockchain have been seriously
    questioned. As for costs, users are prepared to invest significant funds to embed
    BT into current agri-food systems (Wang et al., 2019b). Increased energy consumption
    also has to be expected, as complexity requires more computational power to confirm
    more blocks (Sander et al., 2018). For example, the bitcoin network is currently
    estimated to consume about 2.5 GW of electricity (i.e., approximately the energy
    consumption of Ireland). High knowledge demands also limit the blockchain adoption
    in agriculture because it is crucial to have in-depth knowledge and skills about
    how to utilize the blockchain in agri-food management (Zhao et al., 2019). The
    absence of policies and regulations is another challenge. First, large fluctuations
    of cryptocurrency value reduce the public trust in BT. This has general negative
    effects on the reputation of blockchain, slowing the adoption of this technology
    in agriculture (Kamilaris et al., 2019). This situation persists because of a
    lack of relevant policies and regulations which can control speculative behavior
    and reduce volatility in financial markets. Second, global agricultural industry
    chains involve various stakeholders in the blockchain application, but there are
    no laws or regulations for them to follow. This lack of censorship creates many
    uncertainties (Zhao et al., 2019). Clearly, it will be necessary to introduce
    new standards, laws, or regulations—enforceable internationally—to monitor and
    regulate the application of blockchain in the agri-food industry (Hughes et al.,
    2019). 5.2.3. Future research related to specific challenges 5.2.3.1. Security
    and privacy A lack of data security and privacy negatively affects the precision
    of the process, as farmers are apprehensive of data theft during data transfer
    to external systems. Furthermore, members in the supply chain are not willing
    to share their data with competitors in a transparent system. Although various
    schemes, such as ring signatures, for data security and privacy have been applied
    to blockchain-based agriculture, there are no schemes to hide transaction information
    of senders and receivers and the amount at the same time (Zhao et al., 2019).
    Therefore, data control and protection are important in ICT- and blockchain-based
    agriculture. In the future, studies should focus on how to simultaneously conceal
    multi-party transaction information in theoretical research and technological
    practices. In addition, the roles and functions of governments in promoting this
    new technology should be evaluated. It is also crucial to evaluate (i) how data
    users regulate their behavior and thus contribute to data protection, and (ii)
    how to reduce reservation of data sharing in ICT- and blockchain-based farming.
    5.2.3.2. Scalability and interoperability Scalability problems feature in the
    discussion of both ICT- and blockchain-based agriculture. Crucial issues of scalability
    and interoperability have not received sufficient consideration in ICT-based agriculture,
    while latency problems inhibit scalability in BT. The integration of various techniques
    into blockchain, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence, has already
    been suggested and extended into education and academia for sustainability (Biswas
    et al., 2018; Lezoche et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2019). These programs and studies
    can educate professionals with specific knowledge such as networking, computing,
    and programming. Then they can apply their knowledge into innovation (technology,
    product, pattern, organization, and market) for sustainable development. Research
    on innovation systems and Triple Helix (TH) models has revealed that cooperation
    among firms and universities can help to boost innovation and economic development
    (Khan and Park, 2013; Li et al., 2018). Future research can employ innovation
    systems or TH approaches to discuss technology innovation and the transfer of
    ICT- and blockchain-based agriculture. Simultaneously, universities have an underlying
    role in helping the movement of human societies toward sustainable development
    (Monavvarifard et al., 2019). Therefore, it is logical for universities to hold
    courses, conduct research, and create programs for ICT- and blockchain-based education
    to promote these technologies. 5.2.3.3. High cost, high consumption, and high
    knowledge demands The fear of investment recovery in the application of ICT and
    BTs in agriculture is a concern. Future opportunities can use TRIZ theory (Theory
    of Inventive Problem Solving) to improve technologies to reduce costs. At macro
    levels, governments use financial and non-financial means to encourage technological
    innovation and diffusion, which help to reduce costs gradually. Political scholars
    need to investigate how to influence policymakers most effectively to formulate
    appropriate policies for promoting technology innovation (Guan and Yam, 2015;
    Shu et al., 2015). The main problems with high consumption relate to the volume
    of electricity usage and carbon dioxide emissions, which contradict the goal of
    being a low-carbon and sustainable environment. Using the Drive-Force-Pressure-State-Impact-Response
    (DFPSR) model, a systematic indicator to measure environmental and sustainable
    development can be derived; future investigations can conduct comparative analyses
    on agricultural development, based on various ICTs and the application of blockchains,
    to identify and promote eco-friendly programs. Likewise, it is also important
    to improve green technologies in the development of ICT and blockchain. 5.2.3.4.
    Policies and regulations Barriers to policies and regulations are the absence
    of uniform standards with which participants can comply. These standards improve
    market stability by regulating the behavior of practitioners, increasing public
    trust and technology adoption. Future research can study standards and policies
    in the agricultural industry; however, it should be noted that implementation
    of uniform standards strongly depends on actors in the industrial chain who leverage
    it to develop equipment, systems, hardware, and software. Future research should
    also consider the different functions and roles of governments in enforcing standards
    at different stages. In the infancy phase, studies can investigate how authorities
    integrate resources, coordinate, solve conflicts, and encourage more initiatives
    to improve the effects of these two technologies in agriculture. In the developing
    phase, the research should focus on how to transfer policies or regulations of
    policy guidance into market guidance, and subsequently, how to consolidate marketization
    outcomes. 6. Conclusion In response to a lack of understanding of their usage,
    this study was undertaken to investigate how ICT and BT technologies had been
    adopted in the development of precision agriculture. Technique adoption is the
    prerequisite to their application. ICT technique adoption is affected by application
    design factors and socio-demographic factors, while research in BTs only focuses
    on application design factors. Our analysis suggests that there is an omission
    involved in the socio-demographic impacts of BT adoption. Considering these factors
    will be beneficial for empirical testing, including evaluating important influences
    on BT implementation. As for the application of technology in precision agricultural
    practice, ICTs and BTs have similar applications in information provision in agricultural
    production, tracing in logistics, and trust-building in the supply chain. However,
    in areas of ICT-based agriculture, research to date mainly focuses on the application
    of ICT in production practices, whereas studies in blockchain-based agriculture
    pay more attention to transparency and efficiency in the supply chain. In terms
    of consumption, ICTs focus on the balance of supply and demand, while BTs investigate
    effects on consumer purchasing decisions. Our comparison reveals that BT applications
    can extend ICT-based agriculture practice from production to the whole industry.
    The information transparency and transaction automation consolidate ICT-based
    scenarios and make up for uncertainties. Most importantly, this expressed viewpoint
    provides a starting point for further proposed investigation into how these two
    techniques affect and improve precision agriculture. Moreover, four barriers are
    identified in ICT- and blockchain-based agriculture for future opportunities:
    security and privacy, scalability and interoperability, high cost, consumption,
    and knowledge demands, and the lack of policies and regulations related to standard
    criteria for market stability. In order to address each barrier, recommendations—innovation
    system theory for technology innovation, TH models for ICT and blockchain development,
    TRIZ theory for technique improvement to reduce cost, and the DFPSR model to identify
    and promote eco-friendly programs—are suggested for governments, firms, and universities
    to investigate these technologies further. While all these identified opportunities
    for further investigation need attention, it is noted that research or theoretical
    studies will take some time. In contrast, there are some practical measures that
    could be implemented more quickly and would, directly or indirectly, benefit the
    situation. Some security and privacy issues could be alleviated by educational
    programs reinforced with the development of policy and regulatory frameworks.
    The article has a few limitations. The ISI Web of Science was used as the database
    for the systematic literature review. It is likely that we missed a few significant
    studies that are not available in the ISI Web of Science database. Therefore,
    future research should include other databases besides the ISI Web of Science.
    Moreover, the findings presented herein are based on the systematic literature
    review, necessitating further research to validate the findings empirically. In
    summary, although the literature reviewed on ICT and BT in precision agriculture
    highlights the tremendous progress in the field, there are important practical
    barriers and knowledge gaps that are slowing the implementation of these technologies
    and, more generally, the development of sustainable precision agriculture. We
    hope that this enhanced understanding will lead to improved knowledge and better
    managerial guidance for the implementation of precision agriculture using ICT
    and BT. CRediT authorship contribution statement Wei Liu: Investigation, Supervision,

  description: Modern-day agriculture supply chains have evolved from sovereign and
    autonomous local stakeholders to a worldwide interconnected system of multiple
    participants linked by complicated interactions, impacting the production, processing,
    transportation, and delivery of food to end consumers. Regular instances of fraudulent
    acts reveal a lack of openness in agriculture supply chains, raising worries about
    financial losses, eroding customer trust, and lowering corporate brand value.
    To develop an efficient and reliable trading environment, several fundamental
    modifications in the present supply chain architecture are required. There is
    broad consensus that blockchain can improve transparency in agriculture-food supply
    chains (agri-food SCs). Consumers now demand safe, sustainable, and equitable
    food production processes, and businesses are using blockchains and the internet
    of things to meet these needs. For enhanced responsiveness in agri-food SCs, new
    concepts have evolved that combine blockchains with various Industry 5.0 technologies
    (e.g., blockchain technology, big data, internet of things (IoT), radio frequency
    identification (RFID), near field communication (NFC), etc.). It is critical to
    cut through the hype and examine the technology’s limits, which might stymie its
    acceptance, implementation, and scalability in agri-food supply chains. This study
    presents Agri-SCM-BIoT (Agriculture Supply Chain Management using Blockchain and
    Internet of things) architecture to address the storage and scalability optimization,
    interoperability, security and privacy issues security, and privacy of personal
    data along with storage concerns with present single-chain agriculture supply
    chain systems. We also discussed the classification of security threats with IoT
    infrastructure and possible available blockchain-based defense mechanisms. Finally,
    we discussed the features of the proposed supply chain architecture, followed
    by a conclusion and future work.

  explanation: 'The purpose of this review is to explore the current state and future
    potential of automated systems for real-time irrigation management. The authors
    aim to identify gaps and propose solutions related to the interoperability and
    integration of components within automated irrigation management systems.


    The authors highlight the need for interoperability and standardization as key
    challenges in integrating automated systems with existing irrigation infrastructure
    and other precision agriculture technologies. They propose a multi-tiered blockchain-edge
    architecture for modular and distributed security, which can be applied to different
    segments of the agri-supply chain network.'
  extract_1: Blockchain and distributed ledger technologies for secure and tamper-proof
    data sharing and traceability are explored, highlighting their potential to enhance
    transparency in the agri-food supply chain, reduce inefficiencies, and promote
    sustainable practices.
  extract_2: A new multi-tiered blockchain-edge architecture is proposed to tackle
    the interoperability and scalability challenges in integrating automated systems
    with existing irrigation infrastructure and other precision agriculture technologies.

    Modern-day agriculture supply chains have evolved from sovereign and autonomous
    local stakeholders to a worldwide interconnected system of multiple participants
    linked by complicated interactions, impacting the production, processing, transportation,
    and delivery of food to end consumers. Regular instances of fraudulent acts reveal
    a lack of openness in agriculture supply chains, raising worries about financial
    losses, eroding customer trust, and lowering corporate brand value. To develop
    an efficient and reliable trading environment, several fundamental modifications
    in the present supply chain architecture are required. There is broad consensus
    that blockchain can improve transparency in agriculture-food supply chains (agri-food
    SCs). Consumers now demand safe, sustainable, and equitable food production processes,
    and businesses are using blockchains and the internet of things to meet these
    needs. For enhanced responsiveness in agri-food SCs, new concepts have evolved
    that combine blockchains with various Industry 5.0 technologies (e.g., blockchain
    technology, big data, internet of things (IoT), radio frequency identification
    (RFID), near field communication (NFC), etc.). It is critical to cut through the
    hype and examine the technology’s limits, which might stymie its acceptance, implementation,
    and scalability in agri-food supply chains. This study presents Agri-SCM-BIoT
    (Agriculture Supply Chain Management using Blockchain and Internet of things)
    architecture to address the storage and scalability optimization, interoperability,
    security and privacy issues security, and privacy of personal data along with
    storage concerns with present single-chain agriculture supply chain systems. We
    also discussed the classification of security threats with IoT infrastructure
    and possible available blockchain-based defense mechanisms. Finally, we discussed
    the features of the proposed supply chain architecture, followed by a conclusion
    and future work. Keywords: precision agriculture; supply chain; blockchain; internet

    is one of the significant fields in the world, affecting all human existence.
    Agriculture production is substantial for a nation’s economy along with the security,
    nutrition, and health of its populace. Agriculture practice involves a lot of
    choices and vulnerabilities such as weather remains changing from season to season,
    the market price of agriculture products keeps fluctuating, degrading soil quality,
    not sustainable crops, weeds and pests harm produce, and global climate change.
    In the agriculture supply chain, big data analytics might be employed to analyze
    the food quality, storage conditions, weather patterns in a particular geographic
    area, soil quality such as pH and nutrients, marketing and trade management, and
    the existence of food hazards by relating biotic or abiotic data with development
    and probabilistic existence of pathogens, pests, and toxicants. It can also be
    used for determining the behavior of customers and inventory management. Thus,
    it offers a prospect to utilize the data by abiding by the scientific methods
    and making efficient decisions at right time. To utilize agricultural big data
    a holistic approach involving several relevant technologies and data of various
    related sectors is required. Researchers, legislators, farmers, and other stakeholders
    can utilize agricultural big data for research, policymaking, decision making,
    crop management, and business management [1]. Figure 1 represents the characteristics
    of blockchain, IoT, artificial intelligence (AI), and big data for the agricultural
    sector. To keep up with such uncertainties farmers need to change their practicing
    approaches. Figure 1. Characteristics of blockchain, AI, IoT, and big data for
    smart farming. Farmers, processing factories, distributors, retailers, and consumers
    are all part of the complicated food supply chain involving many stakeholders.
    All food processing enterprises and supply chains must now provide safe food as
    a crucial and legally defined need. CAC/GL 60–2006 lays forth the basics of food
    traceability [2]: as acceptable to the targets of the food testing and enforcement
    scheme, the traceability/product tracking solution must be able to distinguish
    at any given stage of the food supply chain (from the production process to retailing)
    from where the food came (one step back) and where the food went (one step forward)
    from where the food came (one step back) and where the food went (one step forward).
    National and international regulations support the implementation of these concepts
    (see, for example, European Union (EU) Regulation (EC) No. 178/2002 and national
    methods assessed by Charlebois et al. [3]. Because all actors know who their suppliers
    are and where their product is sold, this pragmatic one up/one down system connects
    all tied supply chain participants. However, because many food items have complicated
    multistep vertical and horizontal branching supply networks, relying on the one
    up/one down strategy makes the supply chain susceptible (e.g., multiple ingredient
    products). Furthermore, with commodity items that are blended (e.g., milk from
    several farms in a dairy) or dissected and mixed across the supply chain, one
    up/one down traceability can be easily lost (e.g., animals for meat production).
    With this level of intricacy, verifying the provenance and quality requirements
    of individual items becomes nearly difficult. Furthermore, the food sector continues
    to rely heavily on paper records, and the present food traceability systems are
    not integrated nor linked across all participants in the supply chain. This isolation
    creates a negative information imbalance among all supply chain stakeholders,
    a lack of transparency across numerous supply chain processes, and the potential
    for fraud to be promoted or concealed. Although several technologies for product
    traceability have previously been employed, such as bar codes, RFID tags, and
    Electronic Data Interchange (EDI), Bosnia and Gebresenbet [4] stated that more
    technical applications for food supply chain traceability are needed. Moreover,
    existing IoT-based tracking and provenance systems for agri-supply chains are
    layered on top of centralized structures, leaving an opportunity for unresolved
    issues and key concerns such as data integrity, manipulation, and single points
    of failure. In reality, obtaining verified and confidential data in a supply chain
    is difficult because it necessitates a high degree of confidence between cooperating
    parties, and trust necessitates the development of a specific quantity of verified
    and communicated information [5]. Although scholars and practitioners believe
    that somehow a third party is required in the chain to ensure information quality
    and security, the incentive for supply chain stakeholders to increase transparency
    in the agri-supply chain varies [6]. In this way, blockchain may operate as a
    decentralized certificate authority, verifying transactions, and delivering tamper-proof
    cryptographic information to any point in the chain upon demand. Globally known
    food companies have begun to collaborate to accelerate the implementation of distributed
    ledger technology in agri-food supply chains, and early prototype models are emerging.
    Novel design concepts for such a system have been offered in the literature. Globally
    known food companies have begun to collaborate to accelerate the implementation
    of distributed ledger technology in agri-food supply chains, and early prototype
    models are emerging. Novel design concepts for such a system have been offered
    in the literature. In this context, researchers have begun to implement blockchain-enabled
    supply chain product traceability models [7,8,9,10,11,12], however, preliminary
    findings are only accessible for latency, network traffic, and CPU load. Tian
    [13] has recently expanded the initial application to real-time food monitoring
    based on HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points), however widespread
    adoption of blockchain technology in the food processing sector and supply chain
    is difficult and may face several problems [9]. On the other hand, by far most
    of the existing logistic information systems in Agri-Food supply chains like Costco,
    Walmart, Cargill, Albert Heijn, etc., just store, track orders, and supplies,
    without giving characteristics such as transparency, auditability, and traceability.
    These characteristics in an agri-food supply chain will certainly improve the
    food quality and safety, thus are in demand from consumers. Therefore, numerous
    R&D communities both in industries and academia have engaged their efforts in
    developing efficient food chain traceability systems based on emerging technologies
    like the IoT and blockchain technologies, to facilitate remote monitoring at every
    stage all along the supply chain, from farm to fork. The above-mentioned companies
    have recently started experiments with blockchain for their supply chains. The
    contributions of this paper can be summarized as: (i) we performed a comprehensive
    study of the state-of-art of IoT and blockchain technologies in agri-food supply
    chain and highlighted the prospective applications of these technologies, (ii)
    we identified and provided a comprehensive discussion on different research challenges
    of agriculture supply chain alongside the IoT security problems and existing defense
    mechanisms, (iii) we also presented the application of IoT and blockchain in different
    domains of agriculture sector such as food composition, quality, safety monitoring,
    food supply traceability, and farm and food waste management, (iv) we have also
    given the special consideration to security and implementation challenges of these
    technologies and smart contracts in blockchain-based agriculture sector, and (v)
    finally, we introduced a new blockchain-based Agri-SCM-IoT architecture to solve
    storage, security, and some other challenges in the agriculture supply chain along
    with the necessity of interoperability among blockchain platforms to solve scalability
    and growing blockchain ledger size. Though there are several reviews [14,15,16,17,18]
    that focus on IoT and blockchain-based food supply chain management, to the best
    of our knowledge, no work has discussed the interoperability between different
    blockchain platforms and the ever-increasing nature of ledge size affecting the
    scalability of the single-chain based supply chain systems. This work presents
    a systematic literature review of blockchain, IoT, and AI technologies in agri-supply
    chain applications contributing to the existing literature of these three technologies
    by identifying the singularity of individual technological usage and accumulating
    a thorough understanding of the relationship among these technologies. Moreover,
    we exhibit the potential research directions to conduct comparative examinations
    of these technologies in agri-supply chain management and investigate interactive
    factors reported in the existing literature. This paper covers both technical
    and applicative characteristics in such a way that our intuitions can be applied
    for cross-blockchain agri-supply chain scenarios. 2. Related Work To effectively
    manage the supply chain, and thus the human behaviors it includes, all stakeholders
    must agree on the information to be recorded on the blockchain, from raw materials
    to finished goods. The fundamental objective is to choose the information that
    is useful to all areas of the supply chain, with a particular focus on customer
    needs and applicable standards blockchain may be utilized as a marketing technique
    along with operating as a traceability system. Blockchains may be used to improve
    a company’s image and reputation [19], promote loyalty among existing consumers
    [20], and bring new clients since they are entirely transparent [21] and participants
    can manage the items in them. In reality, organizations may simply set themselves
    apart from rivals by stressing product flow transparency and monitoring across
    the supply chain. Furthermore, quickly identifying a source of food contamination
    can boost a company’s brand image [22] and mitigate the negative impact of media
    criticism. With the globalization of business, supply chains are growing more
    complicated, making it more difficult to track things across their intricate webs.
    In reality, stakeholder relationships are frequently complicated. As a result,
    suppliers can be divided into tiers, with a first-tier supplier supplying the
    organization directly with metal cans, for example, and a second-tier supplier
    supplying the raw materials needed to manufacture the cans [23]. Organizations
    sometimes have several suppliers at various levels involved in a single product;
    also, suppliers are frequently non-exclusive to a single firm. Aung and Chang
    [24], as well as Golan [25], have identified three key goals for traceability
    to enhance product-supply chain administration, product differentiation strategies,
    and quality assurance, and improved detection of non-compliant items. Compliance
    with applicable legislation and standards is another factor in ensuring traceability.
    Majority of existing blockchain solutions for traceability management have been
    established based on single chain architecture such as the Fish supply chain [26]
    to decrease the transaction cost and enhance the transaction capacity and make
    system auditable and provide certifications to the product, Wine supply chain
    [27] to improve the performance, revenue, accountability, and security, and implement
    the more secure and secure global transactions, Agri-food supply chain [28] to
    enable quality and certified virtual identity especially for “bio” and DOCG products,
    Agri-food supply chain system [29] to share the authentic data in production,
    processing, distribution, retailer, etc. across the supply chain, Fruit supply
    chain based on public immutable distributed ledger based on decreased variance
    of mining rewards, Pork supply chain [30] to enhance consumer trust by protecting
    the brand and security through transparency, large enterprises supply chain food
    tracking project [31] to integrate the existing systems with the blockchain used
    by various stakeholders, fresh food [32] supply chain to attach the product origin
    data along with sensor data throughout the supply chain with product to enable
    data, and product transfer transparent from farm to fork. Furthermore, the AgriOpenData
    [28] blockchain integrated solution is a cutting-edge digital technology that
    ensures transparent, secure, and public transparency throughout the whole agriculture
    supply chain and in the processing of agricultural goods. This is especially true
    for “bio” and DOCG (Designation of Origin Controlled and Guaranteed) items, which
    may have their quality and virtual identity certified (viz., provenance, ownership,
    seeding, treatments, crop, Internet of Things analysis, processing, storage, and
    delivery). This digitized history of organically cultivated products ensures end-consumer
    legitimacy and improves the agri-food industry’s quality. The variation of mining
    incentives, and thus the necessity for mining pools, maybe significantly minimized
    using some particular FruitChain protocols [33]. For example, in a FruitChain
    with 1000 fruits per block and each fruit taking 80 bytes, allocating memory for
    1000 fruits every block occupies around 8% of a 1 MN block. A solitary miner may
    now get their initial rewards 1000 times quicker (in a day or several rather than
    a few years). Furthermore, DNA samples from an animal may be used to determine
    its breed, but additional data such as country of origin, toxicity exposure, and
    uncontrolled medicine, among other critical factors, can be acquired. To ensure
    the animal’s identity and lifetime, this data may be compared to the blockchain
    record. Dey et al. [12] developed a FoodSQRBlock (Food Safety Quick Response Block)
    supply chain architecture using blockchain and QR codes. They have also proposed
    large-scale cloud integration of the developed system to demonstrate the framework’s
    practicality and scalability, as well as an experimental assessment to back it
    up. Tian et al. [13] proposed a theoretical real-time food traceability system
    using HACCP, blockchain, and IoT. The authors have claimed to achieve transparency,
    reliability, and security with the proposed model but have not provided any experimental
    implementation and evaluation of the system. Leng et al. [9] introduced a double
    chain-based agriculture supply chain architecture using a public blockchain. They
    also study the storage mode, resource rent-seeking, and consensus algorithms but
    have not evaluated the speed and competence of consensus algorithms by considering
    the case for a huge number of nodes and resources on the platform. Moreover, the
    access management for the user needs to be further investigated. Surasak et al.
    [10] presented an IoT-based blockchain traceability system particularly designed
    for Thai agriculture products. Blockchain has been used for creating a distributed
    ledger to increase data integrity and transparency and a structured query language
    (SQL) database has been used to make the platform user-friendly. There is a need
    to further research on the integration of blockchain with the proposed system
    to enhance the security, transparency, and integrity of the system. Dakshayini
    et al. [34] suggested a blockchain, big data, and cloud-integrated crop supervision
    system trying to realize effective demand-based decision support and to achieve
    a simple, auditable, and secure supply chain. The authors have also proposed a
    crop-trading platform to sell the agri-products at different stages. However,
    they have not implemented the IoT-based Blockchain architecture to gather the
    real data from the field parameters and then model the big data-based decision
    support system. They have just used the available data set and implemented a deep
    learning model to predict the demand. 3. Blockchain-Based Smart Contracts in Agri-Supply
    Chain Management Agri-food supply chain system comprises multiple levels of transactions,
    each level with different terms and conditions [35]. Different systems with diverse
    characteristics and functions have collaborated in a supply chain, including food
    processing, transportation, storage, and distributors. All these levels maintain
    a record of all the products from processing to packaging, transportation to storage,
    and distribution, which are very long and complex processes. Smart contracts can
    assist in simplifying the whole process and enhance transparency throughout the
    supply chain. Integrating blockchain-based smart contracts with IoT devices enables
    tracking of the location of goods, allows tracking of inventory, and the change
    of ownership rights across the supply chain. This helps companies to prepare well
    for any disruption or incidents. Besides this, smart contracts enable companies
    and customers to determine the quality of the food products by tracing back all
    the information. The characteristics of smart contracts [36] enable their use
    in diverse applications or domains. Several of such characteristics are acquired
    from the core blockchain technology. Table 1. shows the categorization of the
    key characteristics of smart contact characteristics. Figure 2. represents the
    typical structure of blockchain smart contract system having various functional
    blocks like user management and service management modules manages the user accounts,
    services, and smart contracts, business network module agent, API’s are used to
    provide an interface for external components, and virtual blockchain platform
    (such as Ethereum virtual machine) is used to deploy, implement, and supervise
    the smart contract state machine, etc., in the contract run time once all parties
    have signed the contract. The smart contract terms and conditions of the smart
    contract are enforced dynamically depending on the real-time data from various
    distributed sources and the business transactions are secured by blockchain and
    distributed ledger technologies. Figure 2. Typical structure of a smart contract
    system. Table 1. Characteristics of Blockchain-based Smart Contracts. In an IoT-based
    supply chain, smart contracts with blockchain technology can be utilized to enhance
    the security measures [37], to expedite data management, besides enabling the
    communication of diverse nodes or devices in an interoperable way. In smart contract-based
    security management [38], smart contracts can be used instead of digital certificates
    by including a list of several forms of identifiers or characteristics linked
    with the public key of the contract owner. Additionally, this list can only be
    modified only by its owner, and additional security is guaranteed by smart contact
    residing in the blockchain. Thus, by implementing smart contracts in blockchain
    eliminates the use of certification authorities. A blockchain-based smart contract
    simplifies the identity management of the users by providing a GUI (Graphical
    User Interface) [39] to each user having very little collision probability. It
    also facilitates the traditional and novel security schemes by storing additional
    primitives including TLS (Transport Layer Security) [40] public keys. By keeping
    public keys in the blockchain, clients do not need to count on pre-trusted certification
    authorities. Furthermore, due to the transparent and distributed characteristics
    of blockchain, this method is more robust against malicious authorities, in comparison
    to the DNS-based Authentication of naming entities (DANE) protocol [41], depending
    on the domain name system (DNS). Smart contracts and blockchain can expedite and
    develop data management in several ways including access control, information,
    functionality scoping (i.e., same contract can be deployed by multiple users and
    each contract gets its address and execute independently), proof of ownership,
    data authentication, and non-repudiation. Several platforms are emerging for smart
    contracts each having different associated characteristics that suit diverse applications.
    The associated workflows and cross-enterprise value procedures in a smart supply
    chain case can be thought of as an internet-connected intelligent production network
    or supply chain, in which products and services are developed and delivered downwards,
    data and finance move upstream, and smart contracts implement automated transaction
    protocols in both directions. As a result, blockchain technology, when combined
    with smart contract solutions, has the potential to promote entrepreneurial collaborative
    projects in logistics networks even throughout international borders, while also
    complementing existing foundation technology in the direction of smart supply
    chain solutions. Unlike conventional business processes, which are based on trusted
    centralized third-party service providers with their standards and architectures
    controlled by large players, blockchain technology allows these processes to be
    conducted in a distributed manner, lowering entry barriers, and encouraging process
    innovation. This supports entrepreneurial activity by deploying extra confidence
    inside firm networks and supply chains [42]. Furthermore, blockchains are often
    open and transparent, allowing all supply chain players to view, update, and check
    data, while modifying or deleting blockchain secured data is practically hard,
    resulting in increased transparency of all supply chain activities. As a result,
    supply chain providers may publicly advertise their availability to the whole
    market, as well as the capacity they have, enhancing their market position and
    increasing their independence from transportation brokers. This is an option for
    smaller suppliers and SME participants in a supply chain to combine their production
    outputs to fulfill large orders, allowing them to sell products directly to retailers
    or ultimate clients rather than through intermediaries. Wu et al. [43] created
    a smart contract for logistics, demonstrating how contract digitalization can
    complement or replace highly centralized fourth-party logistics providers, reducing
    the layers of intermediaries or businessmen within supply chains by directly connecting
    suppliers, processors, retailers, distributors, and logistics companies. All of
    these ideas are valid and adaptable to smart supply chains beyond restrictions.
    Due to the openness and transparency of blockchain-based supply chains, cross-enterprise
    business processes may be improved and optimized. To oversee and improve operations
    management and supply chain activities, Nyhuis and Wiendahl [44] introduced logistic
    operation curve theory and throughput-oriented lot sizing. However, empirical
    findings show that these theoretical notions do not operate effectively in practice,
    necessitating a revision of the underlying theoretical models [45]. Smart contracts
    may be used to start transactions amongst supply chain units to coordinate and
    optimize the whole supply chain. This applies to time-related issues such as throughput,
    cycle, and lead time, as well as cash flows along the supply chain. So, based
    on the findings, the most promising use of blockchain technology and smart contracts
    in the agri-culture supply chain network is reorganization of the agriculture
    product trading market by implementing cross-blockchain (cross-enterprise) asset
    and data transfer. 4. Application of Integrating Blockchain and IoT with Agri-Supply
    Chain To establish an efficient and reliable supply chain management system, the
    industry needs to employ cutting-edge technologies like blockchain, IoT, and AI.
    A data-driven smart agriculture supply chain with AI, IoT, and blockchain is the
    most promising approach to solve different existing problems. If we could generate
    a huge quantity of data from the supply chain and use that data to drive the decision
    processes. It can help to solve several problems related to food quality, safety,
    foodborne, data sharing across the supply chain, etc., globally. Some of the potential
    applications of blockchain, AI, and IoT in supply chain management are discussed.
    4.1. Food Composition, Quality, and Safety Monitoring Recently consumers are increasingly
    being made aware of the composition and quality of food products [46] through
    different awareness programs regarding healthy lifestyles and technological advancements
    in food science. Furthermore, due to new food regulations around the world companies
    need to label food products in detail alongside quality monitoring. Labeling guidelines
    [24] perform a pivotal part in finding out which scientific tests are suitable
    for a specific issue. Consumers around the globe are progressively requesting
    a guarantee that the origin and ingredients of their food follow the data on the
    label. This is the reason shoppers, producers, and administrative bodies have
    perceived the authenticity of food items as significant quality standards. Thus
    different IoT sensors based on UV-Visible-near infrared spectroscopy [47], DNA-PCR
    methods [48], stable isotope measurement (IRMS) [49], mass spectrometry [50],
    separation techniques [51], and big data are making a rapid advance in food products
    quality, composition, and assessment fields. Thus, the advancements in the development
    of distributed ledger technology along with IoT, big data, and micro-fabrication,
    and miniaturization of spectroscopic devices. Largely, UV-Visible-near infrared
    spectroscopy-based IoT, in association with blockchain and big data analysis provides
    an indispensable and vigorous variety and authenticity management mechanism for
    the smart agriculture area. 4.2. Food Safety across Supply Chain For all stakeholders
    around the world, food safety has developed as a global priority from farm to
    fork. There have been many foodborne outbreaks [52] based on fresh agriculture
    products in the recent past. That results in the dumping of a huge quantity of
    agri-produce to protect public health. It is estimated that the food requirement
    around the globe is anticipated to surge by fifty percent from 2020 to 2050, present
    practices of protecting the health of the masses by foodborne outbursts could
    be infeasible choices for the future. Every day an enormous amount of data is
    generated in the food industry and recognizing methods to abstract the vital material
    from diverse sources would assist in bacterial risk evaluation [53], outbreak
    deterrence, classification of trends utilizing pathogen supervision [54], which
    empowers food safety conclusions and supports decision making. Concurrent supervision
    of agri-food products throughout repository and distribution [55], RFID tag, GPS,
    and QR code like digital labeling that is not difficult to synchronize with the
    cloud, and improved traceability due to blockchain are a few out of numerous benefits
    that ICT can add to the prospectus food safety. The potential of blockchain and
    the internet of things to boost food reconnaissance frameworks are encouraging
    and performing synergistically by integrating AI-based big data evaluation like
    a prompt response towards food safety outbursts [56,57]. It is expected that the
    internet of things would be beneficial to carry out a comprehensive methodology
    in food handling in which key drivers like environmental change, human conduct,
    and economy might be joined to visualize food safety hazards and blockchain will
    enhance the privacy and security of data. 4.3. Food Product Traceability The traceability
    of food products has consistently been one of the main concerns of the customers.
    It is well-defined as the capability of a system to monitor and track the movement
    of agricultural food products across the supply chain from the producer to the
    final distribution stages [7,58]. Recently, with fast economic growth and the
    improved standard of living, people have started to pay more attention to the
    quality and nutritious values of the food. However, various food safety crises
    are always there. Customers from asymmetric information environments do not have
    access to the food supply chain information, which results in high health risks.
    Tracking has emerged as an essential service in the agri-food supply chain [13]
    to guarantee food safety to customers. The incompetence of the food monitoring
    organizations to isolate the source of adulteration in outbreaks break the community
    trust in the supply chain considerably. For instance, amid the Spinach flare-up
    [59] of 2006, it took fourteen days to identify the adulterant substance, and
    abundant resources were utilized. A different case incorporates the romaine lettuce
    episode [60] of 2018 during which all the lettuce was taken down the racks without
    awareness of the beginning of contamination. All available lettuce in markets
    was dumped due to a lack of proper back-tracing mechanism by the food governing
    organizations. The deficient record-keeping methods usage result in the inability
    of back-tracing of food products. This causes degradation of purchaser trusts
    and results in a critical setback for food producers. To solve this problem, blockchain
    innovation can be employed. Blockchain implementation will empower fast and exact
    back-tracing, decreasing expenses from food losses, and saving valuable living
    souls [61]. Blockchain distributed ledger technology [62] could be used in the
    food chain to store valuable information digitally such as food production data,
    ingredients, origin, shipment and storage data, expiry, etc. This will facilitate
    the prompt identification of foodborne outbreaks and the authenticity of the food.
    In recent years, various solutions utilizing several technologies such as IoT,
    RFID, AI, etc. have been proposed to advance agricultural food product traceability
    [7,8,10,12,13,17,29,62,63,64]. Figure 3 below shows an outline of how the product
    and data flow in an IoT-based blockchain supply chain system. The traceability
    system contains all the information about food production, processing, and transportation
    as well as storage conditions. The consumer should be provided access to all the
    information about each step precisely and even about every single ingredient of
    the final product. Figure 3. Blockchain-based smart agri-supply chain. 4.4. Tackle
    Food Waste There are different stages such as harvesting, post-harvest management,
    and repository, processing, distribution to markets and retailers, and consumption
    in the food supply chain through that food traverses from farm production to arrive
    at the consumer [65]. Food loss occurs at stages of post-harvesting (i.e., during
    post-harvest handling, storage, preparation, and distribution) and processed stage
    (i.e., at the retailer operations or behavior of consumers). Food waste also consists
    of losses during the pre-harvest session due to pests and diseases, or other issues
    like losses in fields due to extreme weather conditions, not harvested due to
    price drops, etc. [66]. Food loss and waste at any stage of the supply chain create
    numerous challenges and waste opportunities for growers, consumers, and communities
    as a whole. Loss in produce causes financial losses to farmers, shortages, and
    higher bills for customers. This financial burden is particularly grave for people
    on the food insecurity edge, where a trivial swing in price can substantially
    impact livelihood. Technology-based like blockchain, IoT, and big data solutions
    are being employed to manage food waste, perhaps the most pervasive issues confronting
    the food sector [67]. Addressing this persistent problem has turned into an industry
    critical that is being undertaken using different cutting-edge technologies to
    increase shelf-life, dynamic price adjustment depending on sell-by-dates, and
    monitor automatically food waste at restaurants, retail stores, pre-harvest and
    post-harvest losses, etc. In the food processing industries, blockchain-based
    supply chains are offering better transparency into food productions. IoT device
    network sends real-time data that can be utilized to optimize production processes
    and enhance quality, making it simple to satisfy the consumer needs, tackle the
    logistic issues, and withhold government regulations. Blockchain and IoT devices
    along with big data can provide food companies [67] with effective technological
    solutions to resolve challenging issues. 4.5. Inventory Management Inventory management
    is described as the process of overseeing the movement of goods from the production
    plant to warehouses and from these facilities to retail outlets [68]. It is an
    important part of supply chain management. It is worth noting that demand forecasting
    and inventory management are inextricably linked. If the provider fails to satisfy
    the needs of the customers, the company’s time and money are wasted, and the customers
    are dissatisfied. Alternatively, if supply exceeds demand, vital resources are
    depleted for no additional profit since there are no possibilities to sell the
    excess inventory. High inventory levels, according to several well-known business
    gurus, are one of the key concerns that restrict firms’ profitability [69]. Furthermore,
    as borrowing rates rise, inventory storage expenses rise as well. By precisely
    calculating supply volume in advance and devising dynamic operating plans, ML
    [70] approaches help to avoid such risks. Labor management, inventory system automation,
    vehicle deployment strategy optimization, and supply chain decision-making agility
    may all benefit from machine learning and data analytics methodologies. Proper
    forecasting of demand is critical for supply chain planning and management [71].
    While demand patterns for basic things like food are somewhat steady, demand uncertainty
    in leisure products like apparel and technology may be significant. Supply chain
    managers may use demand forecasting to plan productive business operations, optimize
    inventory levels, assess possible hazards, handle demand exceptions, and develop
    mitigation solutions. Inefficient demand forecasting tactics, on the other hand,
    can lead to inaccurate projections, which can result in considerable financial
    losses for businesses and wastage of food products. 5. Cyber Security Challenges
    in a BIoT-Based Supply Chain Network Supply chain networks are unnecessarily complex
    due to the involvement of multiple persons, business enterprises, governments,
    and maybe even nations. Supply chains confront several challenges, including (1)
    establishing trust amongst numerous parties involved; (2) cyberattacks; (3) cargo
    theft; and (4) counterfeiting, among others. However, in this section, we are
    going to discuss only the cyberattacks in IoT-based supply chains systems. Food
    and drinks are the most commonly stolen products, but medications and gadgets
    are expensive. The amount of security vulnerabilities that a supply chain confronts
    is directly related to the complexity of that supply network, i.e., as the supply
    chain becomes more complex, it becomes more vulnerable to various types of security
    threats. These hazards can disrupt supply chain operations in a variety of ways
    such as fraudulent replacement and tamper with items that can lower their utility
    and make them unpleasant for the end-user, the supply chain’s businesses, particularly
    third-party service providers, may not all have the same security requirements,
    and because information technology (IT) systems now control substantial portions
    of the supply chain, cybersecurity is one of the most pressing concerns. The chain
    is vulnerable to a single point of failure due to its heavy reliance on a networked
    IT system. Access to one of the systems can lead to access to other portions of
    the system that are not as secure. The future implication of IoT is apparent from
    its current applications in every field. It is growing continuously due to the
    evolution of hardware technologies including enhancing bandwidth utilization by
    addressing underutilization of frequency spectrum, improving energy efficiency,
    and extending computation and storage features. The cyber-physical systems and
    wireless sensor networks have developed as integral elements for the broader term
    IoT. As a result, the security issues associated with these technologies such
    as WSN, M2M continue to increase. Consequently, with the application of ICT and
    IoT in the agriculture industry, the potential risks of security attacks on the
    smart agriculture infrastructure [72] are increasing. Thus, the food sector is
    attracting more security attacks on its infrastructure and production facilities.
    Preventing such attacks needs a multi-disciplinary approach [73] that covers both
    hardware and software by policies and security mechanisms for preventing cyber-attacks
    or mitigating their impact on its occurrence. Thus, it is essential to identify
    potential security threats [64] and find solutions to prevent these threats. The
    security problems of an IoT network can be classified into three levels: (1) at
    the application layer, (2) at the network layer, and (3) at the perception layer.
    At the application layer, we require studying three security concerns, i.e., user
    data privacy, encrypted data analysis, and secure computing. Thus, when IoT devices
    are connected with the network, identity authenticity and data integrity are required.
    Without any authentication scheme, malicious devices can get access to the network.
    The IoT devices can access the IoT network application layer using cellular networks
    which adopt standard communication protocols. Those standard protocols are having
    advanced security. Two types of threats are faced in the perception layer: (a)
    many terminals have open insecure ports and numerous vulnerabilities that let
    unauthorized devices access. There are always security risks where hackers can
    exploit these weaknesses to launch different attacks and (b) terminals connected
    with short-range ISM band communication protocols such as ZigBee, WiFi, and Bluetooth
    having weak security mechanisms, thus are vulnerable to security attacks. Moreover,
    several of these terminals are having weak login and password mechanisms. These
    terminals also lack encryption algorithms between devices and the network. In
    this section, we are going to discuss major cyber security threats, security requirements,
    and some available solutions. The different types of security attacks to which
    the IoT-based agriculture supply chain is vulnerable are discussed in Table 2
    Blockchain technology finds its applications in nearly all areas of IoT, including
    the IoT-based smart agriculture supply chain [46,74,75]. The convergence of blockchain
    with IoT is to preserve privacy. Some of the relevant blockchain-based solutions
    that can be optimized for agri-supply chain applications available in the literature
    are presented in Table 3. Apart from the solutions presented in Table 3, there
    are several other methods present in the literature, which needs to be optimized
    for IoT-based smart agriculture application requirements. Table 2. Security Vulnerabilities
    in IoT-based Smart Agri-Food Supply Chain Platforms. Table 3. Blockchain-based
    solutions for the cyber security threats of IoT-based Agrifood Supply Chain In-frastructure.
    6. Implementation Challenges Even though blockchain-based internet of things use
    cases have been investigated, but the impact of ever-growing blockchain ledge
    size [87] has not been considered in these studies. Blockchain-based agri-food
    supply chains are a complex network [61] of inputs and outputs from farm to the
    fork and the generation of an enormous quantity of data from the implementation
    of a huge number of IoT devices at each stage [88]. The data produced from the
    IoT devices are sent to the blockchain as transactions [89]. As blockchain nodes
    are append-only data storages by definition. This implies that the node’s storage
    space requirements will constantly rise in direct correlation with the number
    of transactions executed per second [90]. Thus, the size of blockchain grows in
    proportion to the number of nodes that run concurrently, each node will want its
    own written copy of the blockchain ledger, and if you are operating at a large
    scale (hundreds and perhaps even multitudes of nodes), data storage space requirements
    might become a problem [91]. Due to two factors, the storage needs for blockchain
    networks will increase, (i) as the number of users expands, the number of transactions
    for each second increases, and (ii) every transaction expands the volume of the
    blockchain ledger, and since it is append-only, memory usage is continuously increasing.
    When we evaluate this with mutable systems, wherein data gets replaced, we could
    see how, as time passes, we begin to experience the ever-increasing ledger size
    in blockchain-based storage systems. There still are techniques to reduce the
    size of blockchain ledgers [92], but there is rising apprehension that the size
    of these ledgers may exceed the capacity of available storage considering the
    increasing number of IoT-based sensors in agriculture equipment, smart logistics,
    agri-stores, food processing companies, etc. Simply put, we want a system that
    allows us to expand our storage capacity without compromising performance or necessitating
    migrations that would result in downtime. Apart from the ever-increasing ledger
    size, as blockchain technology becomes more widely adopted, every industry and
    institution is transitioning from centralized data storage to decentralized distributed
    ledger networks. With each passing day, the use of blockchain and decentralized
    ledger systems grows. As a result, each sector or organization chooses the blockchain
    technology that best meets their storage, security and privacy, latency, and other
    needs. Thus, we need a system where any supply chain entity with any distributed
    technology can join the supply chain while maintaining interoperability with the
    particular supply chain. The new architecture of the agri-supply chain also needs
    to solve interoperability [93], scalability, security, and privacy of personal
    data along with storage concerns with present single-chain networks. Interoperability
    may be improved by using common standards, this idea must be implemented since
    it will ensure that your networks are future-proof from the start. Furthermore,
    it would promote a strong ecosystem while avoiding any vendor lock-in issues.
    In the foreseeable future, it will all come down to interoperability [94]. As
    a result, adopting common standards to represent your blockchain strategy is a
    wonderful idea. This is something to consider for blockchain installation companies.
    Although most platforms are silos, the technology looks to be moving toward a
    paradigm that can support a network of networks. You must follow a set of common
    blockchain implementation standards to ensure that your solution does not fall
    behind. Furthermore, the initial step would be to create a solution registry.
    In addition, all blockchain implementation companies should make their data models
    and regulations public. When possible, use APIs with permissioned output, and
    base your blockchain strategy on industry standards. For example, the Decentralized
    Identity Foundation [95] publishes a set of rules for identifying digital assets,
    persons, and organizations across multiple platforms. A variety of collaborative
    initiatives, such as the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance’s Burrow and Hyperledger
    [96], support these principles. Figure 4 shows the classification of all other
    primary challenges such as granularity, conflicting interests, stakeholder management,
    etc. faced by the agriculture-supply chain traceability. Figure 4. Supply chain
    (SC) traceability challenges. 7. New Agri-SCM-BIoT Architecture New technologies
    that allow Industry 5.0, such as digital twins, collaborative robots, 5G and beyond,
    ML, IoT, edge computing, and others, when combined with human intelligence and
    innovation, can assist businesses in fulfilling demand and producing individualized
    and customized goods at a quicker rate. This enables SCM to integrate mass customization,
    a major idea in Industry 5.0, into their production processes [97]. Unmanned aerial
    vehicles are being employed in the supply chain to deliver the food packets, check
    and track the stocks, scan bar codes, and upload this data to warehouse systems
    [98,99]. Agri-food supply chains characterize a complicated system of inputs and
    outputs that connect agriculture farm products to consumers. Supply chains comprise
    several stakeholders such as financial institutes, agriculture practices, food
    processing industries, distributors, food retailers, and consumers. Apart from
    the main principle stakeholders, there are other parties like agrochemical industries,
    machinery and equipment manufacturers and dealers, waste processors, and feedstock
    supplies. As blockchain technology is submerging every sector and every organization
    is shifting from conventional centralized data storage to decentralized distributed
    ledger networks. Blockchain and decentralized ledge systems are exploding with
    each passing day. Thus, every industry or organization is selecting the blockchain
    technology that best suits its storage, security and privacy, latency, etc., requirements.
    Likewise, different agri-supply chain stakeholders should be able to select any
    distributed ledger technology while maintaining interoperability with a particular
    supply chain network. Therefore, interconnecting these stakeholders with different
    ledger technology with a particular supply chain is becoming a necessity. Storage,
    scalability, security, and privacy of personal data issues with the current single-chain
    networks also need to be addressed along with interoperability. To transfer assets
    in cross-blockchain systems and to solve the storage and scalability challenges
    of existing blockchain-based systems, we have introduced a new Agri-SCM-BIoT architecture
    (see Figure 4) for the agriculture supply chain. The Agri-SCM-BIoT system uses
    multiple blockchains to meet the requirements of the agriculture supply chain
    business. The local area blockchain, as represented in Figure 4, consists of a
    confederation of logically distinct blockchains implemented across multiple segments
    of the agri-supply chain network. In which the IoT gateways and edge computing
    nodes [100] function as blockchain member nodes. Consequently, each local area
    blockchain segment can have its blockchain ledger, policies of access control,
    and engagement terms. Different IoT agriculture business verticals can be represented
    in each edge-level blockchain organization. For instance, the multiple-tiered
    architecture of blockchain in the agri-supply chain can be used to reduce the
    security attack surface and prevent potential security risks [101] in the supply
    chain by keeping highly sensitive information like banking information away from
    the potential security risk nodes. The different blockchain verticals are used
    to store data of that particular segment like processing enterprise data is stored
    in processing enterprise blockchain vertical but other entities in the network
    are provided with access to trace back transaction data and other information
    at any time. This reduces the large memory requirement at participating nodes;
    the data turn out to be considerably more manageable and improves the latency
    of the system. In this scenario, the IoT devices are not required to take part
    in the consensus process [102], however, issue data transactions to local area
    blockchains. The IoT-based agri- robots, drones [103], and machines with mobility
    needs can utilize cellular data networks to send transactions to their particular
    blockchain segments. The local area blockchain deployments are private blockchains,
    where resource exhaustive consensus algorithms [100] such as PoW and PoS are not
    required. Any new node from outside gains accesses by getting permission from
    its current participating nodes. Consensus algorithms in permissioned blockchains
    produce complex network overhead with the increase in the node count. Consequently,
    puts a constraint on the number of member nodes, and requires to be adopted in
    localized networks. Furthermore, several design factors need to be considered
    towards guaranteeing the integrity of local area blockchain data contents. Since
    private-permissioned blockchains do not accomplish a similar degree of decentralization
    and irreversibility as open permissionless blockchains, it gets important to have
    the option to demonstrate the data of local area blockchains are unmodified. As
    proof of edge-level trustworthiness, it is imperative to either utilize the core-level
    blockchains to intermittently store a hash of some of the latest added blocks
    in each edge-level blockchain or utilize an independently separate public blockchain
    as a store for hashes of all local area blockchains. Some specific local blockchain
    nodes function as gateways between local area blockchain and core blockchains.
    These gateways are very significant for developing the inter-blockchain asset
    transfer in the agri-supply chain. The core blockchain segment is implemented
    between edge and cloud storage as shown in Figure 5 but it functions as a distributed
    fabric for controlling the core chain itself along with inter-chain communication
    among multiple local blockchains and controls access of new requesting nodes.
    Figure 5. Proposed new Agri-SCM-BIoT Architecture. Core-blockchain can be deployed
    as a public blockchain employing consensus algorithms like PoW and PoS for ensuring
    secure data transactions between blockchain verticals and users. Real-time communication
    among the local and core blockchain in place of an authenticating medium and access
    control, following which inter-blockchain communications [104] can take place.
    Inter-blockchain and cross-blockchain communication [105] are being investigated
    by academicians and industries at the protocol level. Transaction fees can be
    implemented within the local area blockchain to secure the local blockchain segments
    from flooding attacks effectively in case any IoT device or devices are compromised.
    The edge blockchain tier is responsible to process those tasks that need to be
    done closer to the IoT edge layer [55] for time-critical applications and transactions
    data gets stored on this layer. The core blockchain is used to store the recent
    transaction hash values only to prevent the increasing ledger size issue of the
    blockchain. It is also responsible for the transportation of data over IoT blockchain
    architecture from lower edge tiers to the cloud computing layer. Smart contracts
    with distributed and self-executing properties are used to automate and optimize
    all the processes (such as selling, purchase, asset transfer) [106] in the network.
    Smart contracts [107] will be used to assist in simplifying the whole process
    and enhance transparency throughout the supply chain. Supervisory control and
    data acquisition system (SCDAS) [108] is utilized by industry stakeholders to
    take different management decisions and control different processes in the supply
    chain. Therefore, the vision and concept of multi-tiered blockchain-edge architecture
    for multiple segment agri-supply chains is an achievable objective for providing
    distributed security. Data and statistical methods can be used in big supply chain
    analysis to enhance decisions across the whole supply chain. The widespread use
    of linked devices like vehicles, RFID readers, mobile platforms, cameras, and
    sensor networks creates a large amount of data. Companies may use big data analytics
    along with ML techniques to utilize this data to develop the attitude, skill set,
    and technology necessary to develop as a data factory [109]. Moreover, big data
    analytics [110] may contribute to the development of new approaches to enhance
    supply chain decision-making mechanisms, ranging from improved frontline operations
    to improved policy decisions, like the choice of a suitable supply chain operating
    model. The ML-based decision support system [111,112] can be employed at the edges
    itself as well as at the data servers to process the collected data. Manufacturers
    and distributors can properly estimate consumer demand using big data analysis
    and advanced predicting methodologies that take into account many elements such
    as weather, special events, and constantly evolving marketing trends. Amazon aims
    to use a predictive delivery system in the future [113], in which things are dispatched
    even before a buyer placed an order. Big data analytics employing deep learning
    and machine learning algorithms can be used to analyze the behavior of sensor
    nodes to detect any adversaries and potential security threats in the network.
    If any node is behaving maliciously, we can remove that node without affecting
    the rest of the network by comparing the current node behavior with the normal
    behavior of the node. Thus, blockchains in food-supply chains can strengthen the
    growing transparency in supply chains due to the immutable transparent and decentralized
    nature of blockchain. It has the potential to impact each stage of the agriculture
    value chain. With IoT and smart contracts, blockchain could trace back the problem
    source, give real-time alerts on problem occurrence, assist in establishing confidence
    and trust between farmers, industries, and consumers. Besides, facilitate the
    fast execution of contracts, thus decreasing cost and delays, and could be employed
    for food certification. Due to its automated nature, the proposed methodology
    provides significant efficiency gains, which removes hidden expenses and paper
    burdens from the agriculture supply chain traceability process. Aside from the
    fundamental security and privacy of blockchain technology architecture, the presented
    models provide tremendous advantages regarding auditability and trust (auditable
    records) which can be viewed and utilized by important participants or external
    stakeholders such as regulators, legislators, and so on). It should also be mentioned
    that the suggested modeling technique has the considerable quality and reliability
    benefits. An immutable and decentralized traceability technology protects quality
    by detecting and preventing tampering with food data. As a result, the excellent
    quality of food items given to end-customers strengthens the agriculture food
    supply chain participants’ business operations. The proposed system will have
    the following characteristics as discussed. 7.1. System Storage and Performance
    Enhancement The continuous expanding nature of blockchain affects the throughput
    and redundancy by exhausting the system resources with managing the expanded data
    processing and communications [114]. The application of PoW for fast mining is
    a very expensive and power-intense consensus algorithm that reduces the performance
    of the whole blockchain network. By applying modular architecture can solve the
    ever-increasing size of blockchain in the state-of-the-art by storing data on
    multiple blockchains. The different blockchain modules such as farm blockchain
    will store data related to farms and processing enterprise blockchain will data
    related to different enterprises. This core blockchain module is designed to store
    only hash values of the previous transactions to solve the expanding ledger size
    issues and lower blockchains (private blockchain verticals) blockchain is used
    to store transaction data. The bulk data is stored in the blockchain-based cloud
    storage for further data abstraction and processing. 7.2. Privacy and Security
    Enhancement In traditional blockchain systems, the data is stored on a single
    ledger, and every node in the network can access that information. This enables
    the users to access the data that they do not require access to, thus giving rise
    to data confidentiality issues. Besides, there are other security vulnerabilities
    and threats such as 51% of attacks and double-spending attack problems. In the
    proposed architecture, we have tried to reduce the security attack surface and
    prevent potential security risks in the supply chain by making highly sensitive
    information inaccessible from potential high-risk nodes. There are some master
    nodes in each blockchain vertical that are authorized to coordinate and communicate
    with other blockchain verticals. These master nodes are made highly secure and
    have high computational resources than other nodes, which reduces the risk of
    51% attacks as well. Some of the data transactions require to get verified by
    multiple blockchain vertical verification. This gives an additional layer of security
    along with decreasing transaction congestion in one blockchain vertical as transactions
    get shifted to another vertical. The participating corporations or entities in
    the smart agriculture supply chain can keep the secrecy of their information and
    specify complex smart contract-based verification within the network. 7.3. Cross-Chain
    Communication between Heterogeneous Blockchain Platforms In the proposed architecture,
    we can think through a multi-organization setup where organizations can communicate
    with multiple organizations (i.e., one or more). These underlying blockchain networks
    connected these entities could be a private or public network (permissioned or
    permissionless) and each cooperate has its own IoT applications and business models
    [106]. The proposed model proposes the amalgamation of cooperate-owned private
    and public blockchains that facilitates verification of private data and exchange
    of public data as required. The private information of different organizations
    makes the block generation rate unpredictable. This property makes it hard for
    the adversary to execute malicious activities in comparison to a public blockchain
    where block generation is known. 7.4. IoT Device Authentication and Data Authentication
    and Integrity Due to heavy IPv6 stake for IoT devices, we will use 20-byte addressing
    generated by using the Elliptical Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) in
    blockchain, which will act as a global unique identity (GUID) need no individual
    authentication for each IoT device due to a large number of addresses generated
    (about 1.46 × 1048) having exceptionally low collision likelihood. The IoT devices
    will authenticate and sign the data by the assigned GUI before transmission, thus
    authorizing the data authentication and integrity. The use of GUID can eradicate
    the need for a public-key management system, therefore significantly simplifying
    the other security protocols. Thus, lightweight security protocols can be used
    for communication in resource constraint devices. Big data analytics employing
    deep learning and machine learning algorithms can be used to analyze the behavior
    of sensor nodes to detect any adversaries and potential security threats in the
    network. If any node is behaving maliciously, we can remove that node without
    affecting the rest of the network by comparing the current node behavior with
    the normal behavior of the node. 7.5. Managerial Implications of Various Stakeholders
    With the apparent technical transformations delivered by blockchain, big data,
    AI, and smart farming, we look to comprehend the stakeholder networks around the
    smart farm. These technologies have caused a significant advancement in the partner
    network function and how they interact with one another in the food supply chain
    [115]. In the proposed system architecture, the implementation of multiple blockchains
    for different levels is used to improve the efficiency of data management and
    privacy of the stakeholders in the smart agriculture system. Each stakeholder
    needs to manage and store the related data to that blockchain vertical. Thus,
    reduces the resource consumption by miners in storing the same information by
    different stakeholders, but the shared data of one stakeholder can be accessed
    by other stakeholders through a specific established authentication process (consensus
    process). 7.6. Transparency in the Agri-Supply Chain Blockchain in food supply
    chains can strengthen the growing transparency in supply chains due to the immutable
    transparent and decentralized nature of blockchain. It has the potential to impact
    each stage of the agriculture value chain [116,117]. With IoT and smart contracts,
    blockchain could trace back the problem source, give real-time alerts on problem
    occurrence, assist in establishing confidence and trust between farmers, industries,
    and consumers, facilitate the fast execution of contracts, thus decreasing cost
    and delays, and could be employed for food certification. 8. Future Work An absence
    of information security and confidentiality negatively influences the accuracy
    of the process, as stakeholders such as farmers are fearful of information leakage
    during transfer to other external systems. Moreover, participants in the agri-supply
    chain do not want to share their information with the business rivals in a transparent
    system. Even though different schemes for data security and privacy, like ring
    signatures, have been utilized for blockchain-based farming, there are no techniques
    to conceal the transaction data of senders and recipients and the amount of the
    transaction. Hence, information control and assurance are significant in IoT and
    blockchain-based agribusiness. Future studies should concentrate on how to concurrently
    hide the multi-party transaction information in hypothetical examination and implementation
    practices. Also, the roles and elements of governments in endorsing these new
    technological developments should be assessed. Besides, it is also critical to
    assess the behavior of users and hence add to information assurance, and how to
    lessen reservation of information sharing in blockchain-based agribusiness. Scalability
    issues come in the study of both IoT and blockchain-based agri-sector. Critical
    problems of latency and scalability are not studied sufficiently in the blockchain-based
    agriculture supply chain. The convergence of different technologies like IoT and
    AI in the blockchain is already been investigated in academia and industry for
    sustainability. Then the outcome of the investigations can be applied to the innovation
    for agriculture industry sustainable development. The apprehension of financial
    investment retrieval in the implementation of these advanced technologies among
    farmers is a concern. Future opportunities should utilize the “theory of inventive
    problem solving” to develop technologies to decrease expenses. Political scholars
    require researching how to encourage policymakers efficiently to devise proper
    policies to encourage technology innovation. High energy usage and carbon dioxide
    emissions are the foremost glitches, which oppose the objective of a sustainable
    environment. Further research needs to perform comparative studies on the development
    of agri-sector, based on different IoT and blockchain applications, to distinguish
    and promote eco-friendly and green technologies. The nonexistence of uniform standards
    is the main hindrances to policies and guidelines with which participants can
    follow. These standards build up market stability by regulating the participants’
    behavior, boosting public trust, and the adoption of technological inventions.
    Future investigation can study policies and standards in the agriculture sector;
    though, implementation of identical standards is deeply dependent on various stakeholders
    in the supply chain who control the equipment, systems, hardware, and software
    development. For imposing standards at various points of the supply chain future
    studies must examine the government roles and functions. Researchers should explore
    how management integrates resources, synchronize, addresses conflicts, and promote
    more schemes to enhance the impacts of these technologies in the agri-sector.
    9. Conclusions It is well understood from the literature review that the application
    of blockchain, AI, and IoT in agriculture is still in the developing stage. The
    existing work mainly comprises evocative and prescriptive studies with very few
    definite systems being designed and implemented, even at the prototype level.
    There is a requirement of implementing a large number of real-time use cases to
    analyze the suggested results that many existing works claim including improved
    performance, intelligent decision support, security, and privacy of different
    acting entities throughout the supply chain, enhanced food safety, and environment-friendly
    techniques. Besides, there is a need to develop optimization tools to implement
    the existing solutions of these technologies in agriculture applications and can
    assist in addressing various implementation challenges. Motivated by the characteristics
    and solutions offered by technologies such as blockchain technology, IoT, and
    AI to deliver reliable, transparent, secure services and smart decision support
    systems for all supply chain management operations, this study presents Agri-SCM-BIoT
    architecture (cf. Figure 5) to address storage and scalability optimization, interoperability,
    security and privacy issues, and storage concerns with existing single-chain agriculture
    supply chain systems. The new Agri-SCM-IoT infrastructure should be built to use
    as minimum computing power, memory, energy, and bandwidth as possible. Because
    of the sensors’ limited capabilities, including security elements to ensure Confidentiality,
    Integrity, and Availability is difficult. However, because it includes several
    stakeholders and diverse parties, it is necessary to develop a trustworthy blockchain-based
    cross-chain SCM system. The future smart and secure SCM system should be resource-efficient,
    appropriate, simple to implement, provide interoperability, and most importantly,
    trustworthy without the need for human participation. Even though the literature
    studied on the blockchain, AI, and IoT in the agriculture supply chain highlight
    remarkable growth in the sector, there are significant limitations and research
    gaps hindering the implementation of these technologies and extensively the sustainable
    development of the agriculture sector. We expect that this study will provide
    enhanced understanding and guidance for the further research and implementation
    of smart agri-supply chain management using these technologies. Author Contributions

    This paper gives insight to the prospective use of big data for dynamic risk management
    from a microbiological safety perspective in the context of the International
    Commission on Microbiological Specifications for Foods (ICMSF) conceptual equation,
    and describes examples of how a dynamic risk management system (DRMS) could be
    used in real-time to identify hazards and control Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia
    coli risks related to leafy greens. Introduction An estimated 600 million people
    fall ill through the consumption of contaminated food and 420,000 die every year,
    resulting in the loss of 33 million Disability-Adjusted Life Years (World Health
    Organization, 2015). These estimates can be used to direct food safety policy
    and risk management options (Scallan et al., 2011). The need for a risk-based
    approach for production of safe food is underpinned by the adoption of HACCP with
    the necessary prerequisite programs. In turn, risk management metrics, with tools
    and concepts such as Food Safety Objectives (FSO) and Performance Objectives (PO),
    proposed by the International Commission on Microbiological Specifications for
    Foods (ICMSF) and adopted by the Codex Alimentarius Commission (International
    Commission on Microbiological Specifications for Foods, 2010; Codex Alimentarius
    Commission, 2016) represent a more quantitative risk management approach that
    can be used by intergovernmental agencies, national governments, and food businesses.
    Food safety related data, acquired throughout the food chain is required for real-time
    food safety decision-making by all stakeholders, including risk assessors, managers,
    and communicators. Global megatrends, described as transformative global forces
    will pose significant challenges to future global food safety, food security,
    and nutrition (High Level Panel of Experts, 2017; King et al., 2017). Key drivers
    for change include: Global economic growth/investment/trade pricing, innovation
    in food production and productivity, structural and socio-economic impacts on
    food supply chains and changing food safety and quality management systems. The
    rapid expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) and digital transformation (Wellness
    Recovery Action Plan, 2015; Food and Agriculture Organization and World Health
    Organization, 2018) has enabled the collection and transfer of “big data,” in
    real-time. This can impact most parts of the food chain. Key characteristics of
    big data are often referred to as: volume of data produced; velocity – speed of
    data streaming; veracity – uncertainty of data; variety – structured and unstructured
    data; and ultimately value – the worth of data for actionable insights and information
    for food safety, public health, and trade (Marvin et al., 2017). The ability to
    collect, analyze, and convey digital data at all stages of the food value chain
    has seen an exponential increase in the volume, velocity, variety, and veracity
    of data available. Data sources impacting food safety include food production,
    food consumption, public health, agriculture, environmental conditions logistics,
    social media, etc., containing structured and unstructured formats. The ability
    to extract value from these data, while ensuring the interoperability of different
    sources to assure food safety and quality, is the future challenge. While data
    scientists can easily build tools and dashboards to visualize data, often the
    outcomes have highlighted the need to have “clean” and reliable (meta)data, in
    formats that can be accurately interpreted by subject matter experts (Ridzuan
    and Zainm, 2019). The emergence of precision agriculture, often referred to “smart
    farming,” using digitalization in farming practices (Bhakta et al., 2019; Shafi
    et al., 2019) and “omics-based” precision food safety (Kovac et al., 2017; Kovac,
    2019) leverages linked data for foodborne outbreak traceability, predictive analytics,
    artificial intelligence (AI) and machine-learning in the realm of food safety
    management. Digital transformation in food manufacturing and supply chain enables
    better utilization of data for more dynamic risk management, automated adjustment
    for deviations, real-time transparency of food safety and quality control parameters,
    product release, defect rate reduction, and trend analysis. This paper examines
    the increasing opportunities to collect, integrate, analysis, and interpret data
    throughout the food value chain, to predict, assess, and manage microbial food
    safety risks, in the context of a dynamic risk management system (DRMS). Simulation
    scenarios are described whereby Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC)
    contamination of leafy greens occurs during production and processing, but it
    can be controlled in real-time by using big data to investigate and manage the
    risk. The challenges of valuable data availability, accessibility, ownership,
    and interoperability will also be discussed. Precision Agriculture and Digital
    Food Supply Chain: Inputs for Food Safety Management Food production, and concomitantly
    the safety and quality of food, originates on farms. Increased data availability
    via the internet now allows for devices on farms to connect to IoT networks to
    collect and interpret data from the beginning of the supply chain through to retail/consumers.
    Precision agriculture enables agricultural production systems to deploy robotics,
    sensors, global navigation satellite systems (GPS), and big data analytics to
    gather unique data on a more precise, spatial, and temporal scale (Aqeel-Ur-Rehman
    et al., 2014; Wolfert et al., 2017; Weersink et al., 2018; Astilla et al., 2019).
    Consequently, the information gathered can be used for the application of more
    prescriptive inputs to support production crop/livestock yields, environmental
    impacts, economic returns, and food security/safety to improve food safety management
    decisions. Kamilaris et al. (2017) provide an example of data that can be garnered
    from precision agriculture to help guide food safety, albeit not specifically
    microbiological safety. Using the tools of smart farming and data analytic platforms,
    the needs of individual livestock or crop areas can be targeted and customized
    with inputs such as rotation feeding, pesticide application/withdrawal or irrigation
    (Ramundo et al., 2016; Grieve et al., 2019). Furthermore, these technologies can
    provide an opportunity for farmers to increase food security with decreased environmental
    impact (Garnett et al., 2013). A major benefit of the emerging agricultural precision
    technologies is the opportunity to ensure greater transparency, traceability,
    provenance as well as food safety and quality attributes (Danezis et al., 2016).
    Investigations of foodborne outbreaks linked to plant or animal-based products
    (Currie et al., 2019; Self et al., 2019), food fraud (Van Rijswijk and Frewer,
    2012), and consumer demand for food provenance (Badia-Melis et al., 2015; Danezis
    et al., 2016), confirm the need for assimilation and integration of “agricultural”
    data. The future prospect is that big data can be used to predict the presence
    of pathogens or contaminants, by linking environmental information with pathogen
    growth and/or hazard occurrence. For example, by monitoring the conditions of
    crops in the field including weather data, the areas with an increased potential
    of aflatoxins can be identified before the crop enters the food chain (Armbruster
    and MacDonell, 2014). Environmental informatics can help identify high-risk periods,
    which may trigger effective control for the downstream food supply chain. Data
    gathered from digital information systems on farm, including field scanning drones,
    can precisely identify areas within a field, which are subject to aflatoxin contamination
    because of particular crop conditions. In turn, this real-time data, facilitated
    by smart technologies including AI, directs mitigation measures, in the form of
    dynamic harvesting, to prevent food quality issues downstream (Grieve et al.,
    2019). Drones, which are now regularly used in large-scale agriculture, will be
    increasingly used to harness data related to food safety and quality, e.g., animal
    intrusion in crop fields or localized field flooding conditions (Cancela et al.,
    2019). Potential also exists for large farm owners to use wireless IoT applications
    to collect data regarding the location, well-being, and health of their cattle
    (Busse et al., 2015; Köksal and Tekinerdogan, 2019). Biosensors and wearable technologies
    may be used to identify unhealthy animals (Neethirajan, 2017; Vidic et al., 2017).
    Availability of such real-time data enables livestock managers to separate unhealthy
    animals from the herd. In some circumstances, such herd/flock management could
    mitigate potential food safety issues in the human population e.g., if the carrier/shedder
    status of both healthy and unhealthy animals, was available for foodborne pathogens.
    Strawn et al. (2013) have described the predictive potential of combining environmental
    and meteorological data for the presence of Listeria monocytogenes. It is foreseeable
    that further data collecting devices and databases will be interconnected to provide
    voluminous structured and unstructured data at the farm level. This will be used
    to enhance source attribution analysis in foodborne outbreak scenarios and enable
    more precise farming for food safety and quality attributes. The data sources
    that may be used include: crop worker health status, water quality and usage,
    meteorological information, real-time livestock health status, animal health records,
    veterinary medicine prescription records, animal movement records, animal feed
    quality and usage, and farm audit certification records. However, it must be acknowledged
    that some data, e.g., related to personnel (health/medical status) will be inaccessible
    and therefore data indicative of GAP/hygienic practices may be more readily available.
    There are still many processes that are done manually in the food industry, but
    this can change with the increasing use of IoT driven food processing equipment
    (Bayano-Tejero et al., 2019), and the use of IoT in water dispensing, cleaning
    and disinfectant dosing, pest monitoring, etc. Automation can reduce repetitive
    processes, making them more efficient and the digital contents and data generated,
    can provide better insights about the day-to-day operations (Hasnan and Yusoff,
    2018). Blockchain technology (BCT) is a distributed, decentralized, public ledger
    (or database) for permanent and verifiable record-keeping that can transform food
    systems by increasing efficiency, transparency, and collaboration throughout the
    chain (Antonucci et al., 2019). BCT provides the opportunity to access and use
    data, shared by connected partners (public and private) in the food supply chain
    (Sander et al., 2018; Tripoli and Schmidhuber, 2018). It is foreseeable that upstream
    food safety parameters, collated and logged in BC ledgers could be analyzed and
    used as part of a risk-based inspection system downstream in the supply chain.
    Precision Public Health/Consumer Feedback: Inputs for Food Safety Management Precision
    public health uses surveillance data and sophisticated analytics to accurately
    measure the global prevalence and consequences of foodborne diseases (Dowell et
    al., 2016), pathogens in food, and environmental exposure, as well as consumer
    behavior, in a way that allows better assessment of population health risk factors,
    and the development of policies and targeted programs (Khoury et al., 2016) to
    prevent foodborne diseases. Data gathering has helped in public health interventions
    including use of: • Publically available data sets and data obtained from social
    media to predict the occurrence of critical food safety violations in food businesses
    (Goldsmith, 2015). • Mobile Call Detail Records (CDR) to track human population
    movement, while managing outbreaks (Wesolowski et al., 2014; Jones et al., 2018).
    • Use of supermarket courtesy cards and e-commerce sales records in outbreak investigations
    and increasing the effectiveness of product recalls (Møller et al., 2018). A wide
    range of structured datasets are currently available or could be accessed for
    developing improved public health interventions. These include: • The WHO food
    safety platform FOSCOLLAB and other National/Regional food safety databases such
    as TESSY, RASSF (Marvin et al., 2017). • Electronic healthcare and medical records
    (Goldstein et al., 2016), medical claims data and OECD pharmaceutical demand data,
    where accessible without breaches of personnel privacy. • Certification data (product,
    management system, personal certification, etc.) available with third-party certification
    bodies There are also large sets of high volume, unstructured data that could
    be used to trace food incidents or exposure to a particular food by analyzing:
    • Food consumption patterns and trends that could be obtained from digital food
    related platforms used for food ordering or diet management • Social media interactions
    (e.g., increased requests for information on how to treat diarrhea) that could
    indicate the prevalence or spread of an illness (Broniatowski et al., 2014). Precision
    Food Safety: Inputs for Food Safety Management The rapid growth of “big data”
    in the food industry has revolutionized the field of microbial food safety and
    has led to the term, “precision food safety,” to describe all the various new
    data sources that can be used to improve food safety risk management (Kovac et
    al., 2017; Kovac, 2019). For example, genomics-based approaches based on whole
    genome sequencing (WGS) are greatly advancing our ability to retrospectively detect
    food safety outbreaks, and WGS is now being routinely used to characterize human,
    food, and environmental isolates of all key foodborne pathogens, bringing a high
    level of precision to interpretation of foodborne disease outbreaks (Ronholm et
    al., 2016; Brown et al., 2019). An example of this accumulation of big data is
    the creation of the United States FDA’s GenomeTrakr WGS Network, which is the
    first integrated network of state and federal labs to use WGS to track foodborne
    pathogens to improve outbreak response activities (Allard et al., 2016). The network
    consists of a publicly available global database containing the genetic makeup
    of thousands of foodborne disease-causing bacteria from food and environmental
    sources housed at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) at
    the National Institutes of Health (NIH; Tolar et al., 2019). Participants in GenomeTrakr
    include not only United States federal and state laboratories, but also international
    and reference laboratories. A big advantage of using WGS in an integrated manner
    is that outbreaks can be identified at an earlier stage and therefore resolved
    faster (Besser et al., 2019). In fact, WGS can provide information beyond the
    identity and relationship of strains and can help to improve the safety, quality,
    and shelf life of foods. This can be extremely valuable for regulators and the
    food industry to help design, prioritize, and implement effective risk management
    interventions (Food and Agriculture Organization, 2016). For food manufacturers,
    an advantage of using WGS would be differentiation of transient and resident pathogens,
    as part of a food company’s environmental monitoring program. Furthermore, WGS
    can be used for source attribution related to country of origin (Franz et al.,
    2016; Koutsoumanis et al., 2019). In addition to source tracking/attribution,
    WGS can also (i) enable an assessment of the AMR status of strains; (ii) provide
    insights into bacterial adaptation and survival; and (iii) as well as provide
    information on pathogenicity. The latter information can be used, for example,
    to better inform risk assessments, e.g., assessment of the presence of less pathogenic
    L. monocytogenes strains containing a truncated internalin A protein (Chen et
    al., 2011; Nielsen et al., 2017). Omic approaches such as metagenomics are also
    very valuable to help us to understand the microbial communities (i.e., the microbiomes)
    and the genes of interest directly from a food sample, without the need for isolation
    of the specific bacteria that provide those genes (Doyle et al., 2017; Forbes
    et al., 2017). An ideal approach would be to develop metagenomics methods that
    are independent of culture and combine both the detection and subtyping of the
    infecting organisms (including the “natural” microbiome) directly from a food
    or clinical specimen (Ottesen et al., 2020). In the area of food spoilage, one
    can use omics technology to develop microbiome-based pathogen control strategies
    that can be implemented in the food industry. One example is the development of
    advanced sanitation approaches based on an understanding of the different microbial
    ecologies found in individual food processing environments (Gu et al., 2019).
    The next step toward advancing food safety risk management is using a systems-based
    and machine learning approach to omics that would integrate all of the genomic,
    metagenomic, phenotypic, and epidemiological data, with risk assessments informed
    by these data (Deneke et al., 2017). Outbreaks: Potential Uses of Big Data for
    Dynamic Risk Management In 2018, two outbreaks of E. coli O157:H7 were linked
    to the consumption of romaine lettuce in Canada and the United States (Centers
    for Disease Control, 2018, 2019; Public Health Agency of Canada, 2018, 2019).
    In the first outbreak, clusters of E. coli O157:H7 were linked by WGS sequences,
    and leafy greens from Yuma growing region identified as the likely source (Food
    and Drug Administration, 2018a). The traceback investigations (Gerrity, 2018)
    identified a total of 36 growing fields on 23 farms in Arizona and California
    as potential sources of contaminated lettuce, feeding into seven intermediate
    shippers. Only one of these shippers did not comingle romaine lettuce from multiple
    farms and shipped the romaine as whole-head product. Follow-up environmental assessment
    weeks after the outbreak identified three water samples from an irrigation canal
    that delivered water to farms in the local area, including several identified,
    containing E. coli O157:H7 with the same WGS genetic fingerprint as the outbreak
    cases (Food and Drug Administration, 2018b). A concentrated animal feeding operation
    (CAFO) was located adjacent to the irrigation canal, but no obvious route for
    E. coli O157:H7 contamination was determined, and none of the samples collected
    contained the outbreak strain. Growers suggested that leaf freeze damage and dew
    on romaine leaves created conditions favorable for windborne contamination, with
    dust carrying the outbreak strain. Dust has previously been identified as a potential
    route for STEC contamination (Berry et al., 2015). The commingling of romaine
    lettuce from various farm growing fields at fresh-cut produce manufacturing/processing
    facilities complicated FDA traceback efforts. In the following, 2018–2019 season,
    FDA sampled 118 romaine lettuces for E. coli O157:H7 and Salmonella at 26 commercial
    coolers and cold storage facilities (Food and Drug Administration, 2019a). Salmonella
    was not found, and one sample was positive for a non-pathogenic E. coli O157:H7.
    In the second outbreak (Centers for Disease Control, 2019; Public Health Agency
    of Canada, 2019), clusters of E. coli O157:H7 were first linked by WGS (Food and
    Drug Administration, 2019b). WGS also revealed that the E. coli O157:H7 strain
    was closely related to an E. coli strain from ill people in a 2017 outbreak linked
    to leafy greens, but not related to the first, 2018 outbreak discussed above.
    Traceback investigations initiated from six points of service identified 14 distributors,
    17 farms, and 15 specific fields in multiple California counties. This was eventually
    narrowed to one farm, which was also identified as one of the potential suppliers
    of leafy greens or romaine lettuce in the 2017 outbreak investigations. A sediment
    sample from an on-farm water reservoir tested positive for the outbreak strain.
    While the precise route of contamination is uncertain, plausible ways in which
    this water may have contaminated the romaine lettuce included direct harvest/postharvest
    application to the crop and/or to harvest equipment food contact surfaces. While
    the farm did have a procedure in place to collect and test the reservoir water
    for generic E. coli and treat the water tank with a sanitizer before use, verification
    procedure records did not document that the water sanitizer was present at levels
    that would assure that the water was not contaminated with pathogenic bacteria.
    Inspection of water tank sanitizer treatment systems used revealed that some units
    had undissolved sanitizer cakes and that some tank systems were constructed in
    a manner that likely did not allow for optimal sanitizer treatment of the agricultural
    water before use. Potential sources of big data that can be generated and collected
    during leafy green production, such as harvesting, cutting, packing, distribution,
    retail sale and from consumers are identified in Figure 1. Many of these sources
    and types of data have been discussed above. Data generated through WGS was able
    to identify both outbreaks detailed above, and even linked the second outbreak
    to an outbreak from 2017. It is easy to see how traceability technology (e.g.,
    BCT) information can be linked between production fields, farms, harvesters, distributers,
    and points of services, and that lengthy and complicated traceback efforts could
    have been greatly accelerated. figure 1 Figure 1. A number of examples of the
    types of big data currently or potentially available across the leafy green food
    chain that can be integrated for use in traceback to determine implicated product
    source during outbreak situations, and can be used to inform dynamic risk management
    systems (DRMS). Microbiological Quantitative Risk Management in a Digital/Big
    Data Era The conceptual ICMSF equation proposes that the change in food safety
    (microbiological) risk from a food can be understood in terms of the potential
    for growth and/or recontamination (“ΣI”), or inactivation (“ΣR”) of relevant pathogens
    in the food as they move through the supply chain and final processing of the
    food prior to serving and consumption. It is usually expressed as: H o − Σ R +
    Σ I ≤ FSO and is based on the final level of contamination at the point of consumption.
    The equation proposes that the sum of the processes during the farm-to-fork continuum
    that allow pathogen growth, minus those processes in the same pathway that involve
    pathogen inactivation, determine the risk of illness to consumers, because they
    estimate the average levels and prevalence of pathogens in the product at the
    time of consumption. Accordingly, if we can estimate the overall potential for
    pathogen growth, compared to pathogen inactivation in a food/food process, we
    can begin to estimate the risk of illness to a consumer. The ICMSF equation encapsulates
    these considerations by evaluating the initial level of contamination («Ho»),
    the potential for increase (growth and recontamination) or cross contamination
    («ΣI»), and the potential for inactivation («ΣR»), all measured in log CFU. The
    potential for dynamic risk management to identify hazards and control STEC risks
    related to leafy greens using big data inputs to elements of the ICMSF conceptual
    equation is represented in Figure 2. figure 2 Figure 2. Stylized DRMS. Dynamic
    risk management involves the use of big data for quick identification of changing
    conditions resulting in potential changes to the hazard analysis and facilitates
    decision-making to manage those risks in real-time. (A) through (D) represent
    examples of how a DRMS could have been used to identify hazards and control Shiga
    toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) risks related to leafy greens. (A) represents
    the baseline conceptual risk management in a fresh-cut leafy greens operation,
    where the initial hazard level, controlled by preventive measures during production
    is below the Food Safety Objectives (FSO), and (i) no introduction or cross-contamination
    occurs during harvest; (ii) there is a small reduction during washing, and (iii)
    potential increases in STEC populations are controlled by the cold chain. (B)
    represents STEC contamination of leafy greens during processing. The initial hazard
    level is controlled by preventive measures during production, and (i) no introduction
    or cross-contamination occurs during harvest, (ii) untreated water used during
    the wash step introduces a high level of STEC, and (iii) potential increases in
    STEC populations are controlled by the cold chain. In this case, DRMS would have
    had the real-time data surrounding the wash water (see Figure 1), flagged a concern,
    and allowed for risk management decision-making that could have prevented entry
    of this product into the supply chain. (C) represents STEC contamination of leafy
    greens during production. Due to a breakdown in pre-harvest preventive measures,
    the initial hazard level is higher than the baseline, which may be due to a combination
    of factors including (i) proximity of concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs),
    (ii) unusual weather patterns (i.e., winds and freezing), and/or (iii) contaminated
    water sources used in applications that contacted harvested product. For this
    scenario, (i) no introduction or cross-contamination occurs during harvest; (ii)
    there is a small reduction during washing, and (iii) potential increases in STEC
    populations are controlled by the cold chain. In this example, DRMS would have
    the real-time data around production practices (see Figure 1), flagged a concern,
    and allowed for risk management decision-making to prevent entry of this product
    into the supply chain. (D) represents a potential response to (C) using DRMS.
    When DRMS flagged a concern with production water use (see Figure 1), the risk
    management decision is made to treat the water (e.g., chemical treatment, UV light)
    that contacts the harvestable portion of the leafy greens (i.e., overhead irrigation,
    foliar sprays, and aerial sprays) prior to application to reduce the introduction
    of STEC from this source. The risk management decision to treat the irrigation
    water decreases STEC levels to below the FSO. The potential for sensors and communications
    technologies, integrated with predictive microbiology models to assess the microbiological
    quality and safety of foods in domestic and international supply chains has already
    been demonstrated (Goldstein et al., 2016; Vidic et al., 2017). This is an example
    of big data being used to improve the microbiological quality and safety of foods.
    Challenges Beyond Opportunities An integrated system incorporating digitally-derived
    “big data” as inputs for a dynamic food safety risk management, remains a distinct
    possibility. The opportunity to use unused data sources, beyond classical food
    safety management data (e.g., critical limits in HACCP, process data, chill chain
    parameters, etc.) can impact not only transparency and traceability, but also
    can be used to predict and anticipate higher risk scenarios as well as plan and
    implement mitigation measures for microbiological food safety issues. However,
    the digitally disruptive era is not without its challenges in the food safety
    realm. Foremost is the availability and accessibility to internet connectivity
    across increasingly global food value chains. Furthermore, there is the technical
    infrastructure and perceived benefit discrepancy between developing and developed
    countries, large food manufacturers and Small Medium Enterprises (SME) to consider.
    While the volume and velocity of data from precision agriculture, precision public
    health, and precision food safety increases exponentially, the variety and veracity,
    viz a viz, mismatch between provider and end user, increasing extent of unstructured,
    unverified and biased user population data sources e.g., social media, blogging,
    will require a form of validation, cleansing or normalization of the data to avoid
    distortion or misrepresentation. Furthermore, transparency, confidentiality, accuracy,
    and fairness are important aspects of responsible data science (Responsible Data
    Science, 2016). Data scientists will play an increasingly important role in collation,
    combination and visualization of different data sources, while subject matter
    experts such as microbiologists, will still have a vital role to assess, challenge,
    and interpret this collated data for proper risk management and communication.
    While technical issues remain on the interoperability and interconnectivity of
    the IT sources (Manyika et al., 2015), greater hurdles exist around the ownership,
    governance, sharing, accessibility, and security of the derived data. For example,
    concern has been raised on the contractual issues relating to precision agriculture,
    where larger companies invest in digital collection systems, which may exclude
    many stakeholders with valuable input to food safety management (Carbonell, 2016).
    A key tool in precision food safety is WGS, however, inaccessibility to private
    and some public sequenced pathogen databases, while understandable from some stakeholder
    perspectives (Jagadeesan et al., 2019), may limit dynamic risk management assessment/options.
    Similarly, uptake of BCT requires minimum data standards with practical and user-friendly
    interphases between all parties, if it is to be widely adopted in both the private
    and public sector. The perceived bureaucracy and value to smaller stakeholders
    in the foodchain are deterrants to contribute to BCT and therefore garbage in
    garbage out (GIGO) can be the consequence. Near real-time interventions, for the
    management of food safety risks, based on the diversity of data throughout the
    value chain, will require validation using numerous iterations of relevant data,
    related to case studies for foodborne outbreak/cases. Validation is particularly
    important, as these types of data are increasingly being used as the basis for
    regulatory actions, civil suits and even criminal cases. A court challenge that
    indicates that the science could not be totally relied upon would set a legal
    precedent that greatly reduces its potential role as a driver. An avalanche of
    data – so-called infodemic, as illustrated by the Covid 19 pandemic, from verified
    scientific sources and unverified data, can disrupt the role of the risk manager.
    Therefore, risk assessors, dealing with such data, must use it cautiously to inform
    risk assessment, while ultimately, the decision making regarding food safety,
    rests with risk managers. Furthermore, the cost and technical expertise needed
    to achieve precision food safety systems is likely to increase. It is unlikely
    that developing countries are going to be able to achieve the degree of infrastructure
    needed, at least in the short term. This will further aggravate the inability
    of developing countries to gain entry to the markets of developed countries, an
    issue already of concern internationally. This is particularly important when
    one considers that export of agricultural commodities and specialty crops is one
    of the primary ways that developing countries gain access to “hard currencies,”
    which is critical to developing country economic health. Data Availability Statement

  explanation: 'The study focused on examining the applications of blockchain technology
    in the context of automated systems for real-time irrigation management and assessing
    its potential to address the challenges associated with consent management and
    data sharing in precision agriculture environments.


    The authors analyzed the benefits and limitations of blockchain technology for
    consent management in irrigation systems and identified key technical, legal,
    and organizational challenges and proposed solutions and best practices to address
    these challenges.


    The analysis found that blockchain technology has the potential to address the
    challenges associated with consent management and data sharing in precision agriculture
    by providing a secure, transparent, and auditable framework for managing consent,
    tracking data usage, and enforcing data privacy regulations.'

    \ was introduced through Bitcoin in a 2008 whitepaper by the\nmysterious Satoshi\
    \ Nakamoto. Since its inception, it has gathered great attention because of its\
    \ unique\nproperties—immutability and decentralized authority. This technology\
    \ is now being implemented in\nvarious ﬁelds such as healthcare, IoT, data management,\
    \ etc., apart from cryptocurrencies. As it is a\nnewly emerging technology, researchers\
    \ and organizations face many challenges in integrating this\ntechnology into\
    \ other ﬁelds. Consent management is one of the essential processes in an organization\n\
    because of the ever-evolving privacy laws, which are introduced to provide more\
    \ control to users\nover their data. This paper is a systematic review of Blockchain’s\
    \ application in the ﬁeld of consent\nand privacy data management. The review\
    \ discusses the adaptation of Blockchain in healthcare, IoT,\nidentity management,\
    \ and data storage. This analysis is formed on the principles of the Preferred\n\
    Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) and a process\
    \ of systematic\nmapping review. We provide analysis of the development, challenges,\
    \ and limitations of blockchain\ntechnology for consent management.\nKeywords:\
    \ blockchain; consent management; privacy\n1. Introduction\nPersonal data has\
    \ been added to the long list of precious commodities. Personal\ninformation could\
    \ be anything—a name, an identiﬁcation number, medical data, or location\ndata.\
    \ With the world transforming swiftly in terms of technology, every digital activity\
    \ is\nregistered and collected, which may contain sensitive individual information.\
    \ According to\na survey, there will be approximately 75 billion smart devices\
    \ by 2025 [1], which will collect\nuser data to monitor. Users give access to\
    \ these devices to manage their data deliberately\nor without consent, as they\
    \ seem reliable, and user proﬁles are created based on the data\nprovided. This\
    \ information can be exploited by systems that examine the characteristics\nand\
    \ preferences of the user; they attempt to inﬂuence decisions by showing content\
    \ based\non aggregated proﬁles. In 2016, Cambridge Analytica had access to 87\
    \ million Facebook\nusers [2], which were acquired via users who were using a\
    \ third-party application known\nas “This Is Your Digital Life”, where they unknowingly\
    \ gave access to the app, which\ncollected their information and their friend’s\
    \ network information as well. Using extensive\ndata, the company tried to inﬂuence\
    \ then ongoing voters (US Presidential Election 2016)\nby various means. There\
    \ are also other incidents where personal data is misused for illicit\nreasons.\
    \ So more than anything, it is crucial to understand the policies and the need\
    \ for\ndata consent, which brings us to an important topic—consent management.\n\
    Consent management is the action or process to manage user and customer consent\n\
    for processing personally identiﬁable data. In other words, it ensures that users\
    \ can select\nand revoke their consent if desired in different categories (preferences).\
    \ The main steps in\nthis process are collecting consent from users and storing\
    \ the consent in a secure database,\nwhich allows users to withdraw or revoke\
    \ and renew their consent. While the process\nseems simple, it has many challenges,\
    \ especially for big organizations as individual data is\nscattered around their\
    \ business, sitting in company silos. Consent is usually collected using\nHealthcare\
    \ 2021, 9, 137. https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9020137\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/healthcare\n\
    Healthcare 2021, 9, 137\n2 of 21\na variety of techniques (websites, mobile applications,\
    \ and various marketing platforms),\nmaking it very difﬁcult to aggregate data\
    \ (map the data collected to a single person).\nOnce aggregated, the next challenge\
    \ is to store the data in a single repository (a secure\ndatabase). Data transparency\
    \ is another challenge that needs to be focused on, as users\ndo not have the\
    \ perfect knowledge about how their data is being operated. Organizations\nshould\
    \ also ensure that proper resources are available so that users can see and modify\n\
    their data preferences. Identity management is a factor that needs to be considered\
    \ while\ncollecting the user’s consent to the integrity of the information provided.\
    \ The complexity\nof implementation becomes harder as privacy rules evolve. These\
    \ are just a few of the\ntechnical challenges with consent management. The other\
    \ challenge is to inform the user\nof the purpose of obtaining consent and to\
    \ make the user aware of it. Additionally, there\nmay be users that approve of\
    \ the processing of personal information for all reasons and\nactivities, in most\
    \ instances. However, individuals would like to limit their consent, as a\nresult,\
    \ with consent management, all these requirements must be addressed while ensuring\n\
    compliance with the privacy laws.\nWe believe that consent management with Blockchain\
    \ makes the process easier, more\naccessible, and more secure; as it is a decentralized\
    \ technology, it can make the process\nmore transparent and approachable for users.\
    \ A blockchain is a digital transaction archive\nthat is duplicated and circulated\
    \ on the blockchain over the entire computer network. It is\nindeed important\
    \ to mention that the tech giants and banking sectors have invested billions\n\
    of dollars in Blockchain [3]. Bitcoin was the ﬁrst cryptocurrency to use this\
    \ technology,\nand later, more cryptocurrencies such as Monero and Dash started\
    \ using this technology.\nIn 2013, Vitalik Buterin proposed the idea of Ethereum\
    \ and started operating on 30 July\n2015; Hyperledger was launched by Linux Foundation\
    \ in December 2015 and had received\ncontributions from IBM, SAP Ariba, and Intel\
    \ [4]. While Bitcoin, Monero, and Dash\nare referred to as the ﬁrst generation\
    \ of Blockchain, Ethereum comes under the second\ngeneration of Blockchain; the\
    \ third generation of Blockchain are applications that have\nbeen developed for\
    \ various sectors such as healthcare, IoT, supply chain management\n(SCM), identity\
    \ management, etc. The third section explains how Blockchain helps with\nthe consent\
    \ management process.\nThe purpose of this paper is to systematically collect\
    \ and classify all related Blockchain\nresearch papers from a renowned organization\
    \ (IEEE), and to achieve the desired purpose,\nwe carried out a systematic review\
    \ of the Blockchain literature to show some useful insights.\nThere are a few\
    \ insightful analyses of this subject in the literature, our methodologies and\n\
    objectives vary from one another, and most of the reviews focus on one application\
    \ of\nBlockchain (healthcare, education, or data management). We focused on various\
    \ applica-\ntions of Blockchain (in the ﬁeld of consent management) such as healthcare,\
    \ IoT, identity\nmanagement, and data storage. In the review conducted by Ali\
    \ Alammary et al. [5], the\nprime focus was on the applications of Blockchain\
    \ in the ﬁeld of education. Healthcare\nwas the main application of the systematic\
    \ review that was conducted by Cornelius C.\nAgbo et al. [6] and Tsung-Ting Kuo\
    \ et al. [7]. While Fran Casino et al. [8] discussed the\nvarious applications\
    \ of Blockchain, their review was not in the area of consent management.\nTherefore,\
    \ to the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst systematic review covering a\
    \ few\nareas in the ﬁeld of consent management. Our systematic review follows\
    \ the guidelines set\nby PRISMA [9]. It is a well-structured research protocol\
    \ for systematic review ensuring\na thorough and impartial analysis of all published\
    \ peer-reviewed papers that apply to\nthe topic.\nThe rest of the paper is structured\
    \ as follows. Consent management and its importance\nand challenges are presented\
    \ in Section 2. An overview of blockchain is presented in\nSection 3. Section\
    \ 4 presents the research methodology we have followed. The results\nare presented\
    \ in Section 5, and a discussion of the challenges and possible solutions\nare\
    \ presented in Section 6. Finally, Section 7 concludes the paper and offers ideas\
    \ for\nfuture work.\nHealthcare 2021, 9, 137\n3 of 21\n2. Consent Management\n\
    Consent is strictly related to a processing purpose, which is the purpose that\
    \ the per-\nsonal data of an individual is processed for, such as marketing, analysis,\
    \ or healthcare [10].\nConsent management is a method, procedure, or collection\
    \ of policies to enable users to\nspecify what information they are willing to\
    \ allow access to various care providers [11].\nThe main steps in consent management\
    \ involve:\n1.\nCollection of consent;\n2.\nStorage of consent;\n3.\nUse of collected\
    \ consent and data.\n2.1. Collection of Consent\nConsent can be collected from\
    \ a variety of sources—websites, mobile applications,\nCRM (Customer Relationship\
    \ Management) systems, marketing platforms, contact centers,\nand sales points.\
    \ The most traditional way of obtaining consent is through terms of\nconditions/services\
    \ or CMP (consent management platform). The main challenge is the\nprocess of\
    \ collecting informed consent from the user. For an instance, a patient might\
    \ be\nwilling to share his data with a physician but not willing to share his\
    \ data with a medical\nresearcher. In this scenario, the user provided partial\
    \ consent to share his data. Therefore,\nthe consent management system should\
    \ also be designed to capture partial consent from\nthe user. Another example\
    \ could be a user using an IoT device. Initially, the user provided\nconsent for\
    \ sharing his preferences of a smart device with the service provider but could\n\
    decide against sharing at any point in time. Considering the change, the system\
    \ should\nalso allow the user to revoke the consent at any period.\nWith the introduction\
    \ of GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) and other privacy\nlaws in various\
    \ countries, companies must make sure the user is entirely aware of the\nconsent\
    \ they are giving. The company must provide precise information regarding the\n\
    situations where their data will be utilized; in other words, there should be\
    \ transparency.\n2.2. Storage of Consent\nAs indicated above, consent is collected\
    \ using a variety of methods, the main task\nafter collecting consent is to aggregate\
    \ the data. Once properly collected, consent should\nbe stored in a single source\
    \ of truth, which should be a secure database. Data storage is\nvery important,\
    \ as it should be stored in a secure location. Data should also be modeled\nbased\
    \ on the requirement.\nThe period of data storage is another important case, as\
    \ the data cannot be stored\nfor longer periods, only for the shortest possible\
    \ time the data must be stored. The\norganizations usually come up with the period\
    \ of data storage, and they must also ensure\ncorrect and up-to-date information\
    \ is maintained. According to GDPR, the time for which\npersonal data are kept\
    \ should be strictly limited to Recital 39 of the GDPR [12], and the\ndata controller\
    \ shall set limits for deleting information.\n2.3. Use of Collected Consent and\
    \ Data\nThe following questions arise and need to be addressed after receiving\
    \ and storing\nthe consent:\n•\nHow is the obtained consent used for data access\
    \ regulation?\n•\nAre all policies such as GDPR and CCPA (California Consumer\
    \ Privacy Act) met?\n•\nAre there sufﬁcient resources to maintain the transparency\
    \ of data?\nData of a user can be shared with any third-party organizations based\
    \ on the consent\nthat is collected. Overall, the main challenging part of the\
    \ consent management system is\nto get and maintain consent in a customizable,\
    \ effective, and transparent way. Ensuring\nall the conditions set out in the\
    \ various privacy laws is also very important, as failure\ncould lead to severe\
    \ penalties. Organizations should also inform users of the purpose\nof their data,\
    \ and users should also be informed if their data is sold to third parties for\n\
    Healthcare 2021, 9, 137\n4 of 21\nmarketing/research purposes. By following all\
    \ these, the process will be very transparent,\nwhich, in turn, will help the\
    \ organization to build trust with its customers. After ensuring\nall the policies\
    \ are met, there should also be resources to help the customer if they want to\n\
    revoke/withdraw their consent.\nFailure in following the regulations can lead\
    \ up to 10 million Euros or two percent\nof the annual turnover of the company\
    \ [13]. In the following section, we explained how\nBlockchain works and how it\
    \ helps to achieve consent management.\n2.4. Efﬁciency Challenges of Current Consent\
    \ Management\nThere are multiple data sources such as patient health information,\
    \ social media data,\ndata collected from the IoT devices, etc. Since all of these\
    \ data sources contain sensitive\ninformation of individual users, they need to\
    \ be maintained securely. More importantly,\nwe should also have a systematic\
    \ and transparent consent collection by the present systems.\nSome challenges\
    \ identiﬁed in the current systems include:\n•\nMethodologies used for consent\
    \ collection. The current systems are not capable of\ncollecting or requesting\
    \ speciﬁc consent from the users. They use sophisticated single\nterms and conditions\
    \ (T&C). Instead of that, consent should be collected for speciﬁc\npurposes, and\
    \ it must be presented in a simpliﬁed manner.\n•\nData Regulation. After the consent\
    \ is collected, the data sharing must be regulated\nto avoid unwanted sharing\
    \ of the data. Additionally, current systems do not have a\nstandard platform\
    \ where the data could be shared among them. Another challenge\nin the present\
    \ system is the ability to inform the patients when their data is shared.\nWhen\
    \ there is an exchange of information between hospitals or organizations, the\n\
    users are generally unaware of the data exchange\n•\nData handling. The existing\
    \ healthcare infrastructure should be developed to process\nthe huge volumes of\
    \ data and should make sure accurate information is being collected\nfrom the\
    \ patients. Storing and collecting inaccurate healthcare information could lead\n\
    to a fatality when the patient is treated.\nTo avoid challenges, Blockchain can\
    \ be used to maintain a ﬂexible and transparent\nconsent management system. Its\
    \ immutability and decentralized features will make the\nsystem trustworthy for\
    \ the users.\n3. Overview of Blockchain\nBefore blockchain technology, transactions\
    \ were recorded using a centralized model\nthat consists of server-side and client-side\
    \ applications. In 1990, Haber, S and Stornetta,\nW. S. came up with the idea\
    \ of a secured chain of time-stamps [14]. They aspired to\ncreate a system where\
    \ the timestamps of a document cannot be tampered with. How-\never, Blockchain’s\
    \ concept earned its acclaim in 2008 when it was used as a distributed\nledger\
    \ technology in Bitcoin (Bitcoin white paper published in October 2008 [15]).\
    \ The\nmysterious Satoshi Nakamoto introduced Bitcoin, where we can trade electronic\
    \ coins\nwithout a centralized party (banks, for example). In a typical transaction,\
    \ a third party\nmust be involved in transferring money; third parties are not\
    \ always reliable, as there is a\nchance of them getting compromised, and there\
    \ are transfer limits as well; also, additional\namounts are charged when a third\
    \ party is involved. With the introduction of Bitcoin,\nwe can avoid these conﬁnements.\
    \ Bitcoin is a virtual currency exchange that takes place\nwithout a third party\
    \ between peers. It is immune to counterfeiting and is preserved by\ncomplex algorithms.\n\
    Around 2014, cryptocurrency exchanges were not the only application of fascinating\n\
    blockchain technology. It was explored and used in many other ﬁelds. Blockchain\
    \ uses\nthe SHA-256 algorithm to maintain the data changes in the network and\
    \ asymmetric\ncryptography to achieve enhanced security.\nHealthcare 2021, 9,\
    \ 137\n5 of 21\n3.1. Working of Blockchain\nAs mentioned earlier, Blockchain is\
    \ used to make sure the documents have not been\ntampered with, it stores the\
    \ information in terms of blocks. Usually, each block comprises\nthree things:\n\
    •\nData\n•\nHash of block\n•\nHash of the previous block\nInformation stored within\
    \ a block depends on the Blockchain type; for example, a\nbitcoin includes ﬁnancial\
    \ data (details of a transaction) stored in its blocks. The hash value\nof a block\
    \ will be generated when a block is created; its value will not be the same if\
    \ the\ndata of the block is changed and it also contains the previous block’s\
    \ hash value. As seen\nin Figure 1 below, the ﬁrst block in a blockchain is called\
    \ a Genesis Block, and it won’t have\nthe hash value of any previous block; instead,\
    \ it starts from zero.\nHealthcare 2021, 9, x  \n5 of 22 \n \n \nAround 2014,\

    As mentioned earlier, Blockchain is used to make sure the documents have not been\

    \ block comprises \nthree things: \n• \nData \n• \nHash of block \n• \nHash of\
    \ the previous block \nInformation stored within a block depends on the Blockchain\
    \ type; for example, a \nbitcoin includes financial data (details of a transaction)\
    \ stored in its blocks. The hash value \nof a block will be generated when a block\
    \ is created; its value will not be the same if the \ndata of the block is changed\
    \ and it also contains the previous block’s hash value. As seen \nin Figure 1\
    \ below, the first block in a blockchain is called a Genesis Block, and it won’t\
    \ \nhave the hash value of any previous block; instead, it starts from zero. \n\
    \ \nFigure 1. A basic block contains a hash, a previous block hash, and data.\
    \ \nWhen there is a new transaction, a block will be added with the corresponding\
    \ data. \nTherefore, a new block will be attached, and it establishes a chain\
    \ in the process, hence the \nname Blockchain. Due to its immutable property,\
    \ the data in the Blockchain cannot be \nmodified. \nIn an instance where data\
    \ is changed in a block, as the information is changed, its \nhash value also\
    \ changes. Therefore, this block’s hash value and the previous hash value \nof\
    \ the next blocks will not be the same, resulting in breaking the chain and making\
    \ it in-\nvalid, but there is a chance of recalculating the remaining block’s\
    \ hash values to make it \nvalid again with the help of advanced supercomputers;\
    \ to avoid this, we use the concept \nof proof of work. \nThe initial consensus\
    \ algorithm in a Blockchain network is the proof of work (PoW) \n[16]. PoW is\
    \ done by people who are called miners to ensure that the transactions made \n\
    are authentic. This validation method of the transactions is called mining; once\
    \ transac-\ntions are verified valid, they can be added to the Blockchain. \n\
    A smart contract is a program that can act as a protocol or an agreement, which\
    \ can-\nnot be tampered with. This concept is introduced by Nick Szabo in 1994\
    \ [17]. In the case \nof Blockchain, these play a very crucial role. Once deployed\
    \ on the network, these can be \ninvoked or triggered with the help of a unique\
    \ address that is assigned to them. Therefore, \nFigure 1. A basic block contains\
    \ a hash, a previous block hash, and data.\nWhen there is a new transaction, a\
    \ block will be added with the corresponding data.\nTherefore, a new block will\

    \ to avoid this, we use the concept of proof\nof work.\nThe initial consensus\
    \ algorithm in a Blockchain network is the proof of work (PoW) [16].\nPoW is done\
    \ by people who are called miners to ensure that the transactions made are\nauthentic.\
    \ This validation method of the transactions is called mining; once transactions\n\
    are veriﬁed valid, they can be added to the Blockchain.\nA smart contract is a\
    \ program that can act as a protocol or an agreement, which cannot\nbe tampered\

    Blockchain, these play a very crucial role. Once deployed on the network, these\
    \ can be\ninvoked or triggered with the help of a unique address that is assigned\
    \ to them. Therefore,\nwhen a smart contract is deployed, the information is stored\
    \ on the network, which is\naccessible to the nodes that are participating. The\
    \ other nodes on the network cannot\nchange the information on the smart contract.\
    \ There are many use cases of the smart\ncontract. For instance, when we want\
    \ to sell a particular object (car, house, etc.,), a potential\nbuyer can be found\
    \ on the network, thus eliminating the need for a third party. Therefore,\nsmart\
    \ contracts are self-veriﬁable. Solidity is one of the main programming languages\
    \ that\nis used to create and execute. Ethereum and Zeppelin are Blockchain platforms\
    \ that use\nthe Solidity programming language.\nHealthcare 2021, 9, 137\n6 of\
    \ 21\nThere are three crucial Blockchain types—public, private, and consortium.\
    \ All the\ntransactions are made available to the public in public Blockchain;\
    \ anyone can participate,\ncreate, or mine. Private Blockchain or permissioned\
    \ Blockchain—in this kind, users should\nhave consent to join the group, and it\
    \ is more centralized than that of public Blockchain.\nThe third kind is consortium\
    \ blockchain, and it is indistinguishable from private Blockchain,\nbut the key\
    \ difference between a private and a consortium Blockchain is in a consortium\n\
    blockchain, it is controlled or regulated by a group instead of a single person,\
    \ as is the case\nin a private Blockchain.\n3.2. Applications of Blockchain Technology\n\
    Healthcare. An important issue in the healthcare industry is the privacy of the\
    \ patients.\nPatient consent is the key point in the healthcare ecosystem. The\
    \ technology brings a more\nsecure model for patient information exchange. Considering\
    \ its distributed ledger feature,\nit provides more ease of operations between\
    \ the hospitals. It has the capability to achieve\nnationwide interoperability\
    \ between the hospitals for EHR (electronic health records).\nMedChain [18] was\
    \ introduced as a data-sharing system. In this system, the data is\ncollected\
    \ from the medical devices and sensors. There are two events that are created\
    \ on\nthe network in this model. The ﬁrst event is created when the healthcare\
    \ provider adds the\ndata to patient inventory, and the second event is created\
    \ when a patient provides access\nto the requestor. Another blockchain application\
    \ in the medical ﬁeld is [19], the proposed\ndesign is a private blockchain network\
    \ with Ethereum as its platform and a back end\ndistributed ﬁle system. In this\
    \ prototype, the smart contracts are created as a representation\nof health records\
    \ and contain metadata of the ownership, permissions, and data integrity.\nThe\
    \ prototype deals with various use cases of smart contracts such as the process\
    \ of issuing\nthe medicines, sharing the lab results with doctors, and for clinical\
    \ trials, etc.\nInternet of Things (IoT). This is will enable businesses to make\
    \ insights from data\ncollected from IoT devices, which will help them provide\
    \ improved service to the users.\nDevices such as Fitbit collect information from\
    \ the user. In the framework [20], advanced\ncryptography methods are used to\
    \ make the design secure and suitable for IoT devices.\nThe prototype deals with\
    \ off-chain storage, and data is stored on the cloud. The main idea\nis to have\
    \ the cloud servers send the hash of the data to the overlay network. When the\n\
    data is shared to the cloud, the sender adds a digital signature. The overlay\
    \ network sends\nan alert to healthcare providers. When the healthcare provider\
    \ has received an alert, they\nwill have full access to the patient’s data.\n\
    Machine Learning. An insurance company could beneﬁt from the integration of ML\n\
    and blockchain, as identity fraud can be detected before entering the details\
    \ on the network.\nIn [21], the authors have introduced an algorithm to ﬁnd the\
    \ better conﬁgurations of\nweights in a neural network using Blockchain and its\
    \ concepts. The model was developed\non a local network, where the multiple devices\
    \ are connected. Each node on the network\nwill have the same controls. Transactions\
    \ can be viewed by each node itself. This avoids\nunnecessary access to the other\
    \ nodes. Here, each demand is considered as a transaction,\nand in the event of\
    \ a conditional stopping, miners will be awarded based on the better\nresults.\n\
    3.3. Blockchain for Consent Management\nThe following comprises an effective consent\
    \ management system:\n•\nData transparency\n•\nSecure storage\n•\nAccurate data\
    \ management\nBlockchain is a decentralized network where all users have access\
    \ to the data available\non it. For instance, any transaction/movement made by\
    \ the organization can be seen\nby all users, making the process completely transparent.\
    \ Any exchanges made between\nthe organizations can be recorded and can be made\
    \ available to users so that they can\ntrack their data movement. Its decentralized\
    \ nature will make sure that systems are not\nHealthcare 2021, 9, 137\n7 of 21\n\
    dependent on one central authority. Instead, it is distributed across the nodes\
    \ or members\non the network for various approvals or acceptance, making it more\
    \ trustworthy. The\nmost interesting and essential feature of Blockchain is its\
    \ immutability. Once a record is\nadded to the network, the consent of a user\
    \ cannot be modiﬁed. If there is a change of\nconsent, it can be added one more\
    \ time as a different block. Combining or mapping data\nfrom all sources is one\
    \ of the most difﬁcult tasks and can be done using Blockchain. Data\ncan be aggregated\
    \ in Blockchain using a distributed hash table (DHT) [22]. The encrypted\nconsent\
    \ data created by DHT can be stored on Blockchain, and the actual data can always\n\
    be retrieved easily, which also resolves the size issue of the Blockchain, as\
    \ more data cannot\nbe stored in a block.\nAnother main application of Blockchain\
    \ is identity management, where user’s data\ncan be validated by an organization.\
    \ For instance, an educational organization can validate\na student’s ﬁnal degree\
    \ and store it on Blockchain, which can also be used to validate user\ndata so\
    \ that accurate data can be collected and stored. Therefore, using Blockchain,\
    \ the\nconsent management process can be made easier and more compliant.\n4. Research\
    \ Methodology\nWe also followed the recommendations for a systematic review of\
    \ the literature [23]\nand the criteria outlined in the PRISMA statement [9].\
    \ In the ﬁrst step, we have identiﬁed\nthe critical research questions that would\
    \ help us to understand what level blockchain-\nbased technologies (related to\
    \ consent/privacy data management) were built. The ques-\ntions help us in examining\
    \ the issues and constraints. The basic steps involved in conduct-\ning a systematic\
    \ review are shown in the below Figure 2.\nHealthcare 2021, 9, x  \n8 of 22 \n\

    \ that blockchain applications could solve as PII\n(Personal Identiﬁable Information)\
    \ policies went through a lot of change after\nthe introduction of GDPR.\nRQ2:\
    \ What Blockchain-based applications have been built of the described use cases?\n\
    •\nAlthough this technology was introduced in 2008 by the enigmatic Satoshi\n\
    Nakamoto as an essential technology for Bitcoin, it is still a relatively new\
    \ tech-\nnology in other sectors such as healthcare, IoT, and education. Many\
    \ application\nproposals were given in the scientiﬁc reviews, but very few discussed\
    \ the work-\ning prototypes. Therefore, it is vital to learn and understand the\
    \ real-world\nimplementations.\nRQ3: How are the limitations of current solutions\
    \ addressed?\n•\nHere our objective is to ﬁnd out the limitations of the technology\
    \ based on the\nprototypes that have been developed? We will also examine the\
    \ steps taken to\navoid such limitations.\nRQ4: What are the major challenges\
    \ for future research?\n•\nWith the introduction of GDPR rules in the EU, we have\
    \ many restrictions on the\nuse of PII. With this question, we identify the research\
    \ gaps and challenges that\nneed to be addressed so that the applications follow\
    \ the new rules and policies.\nFigure 3 shows the PRISMA ﬂow of this systematic\

    \ the Papers\nMost of the selected papers were conference papers, and the next\
    \ signiﬁcant type of\nselected papers are journal type papers. We have also identiﬁed\
    \ the industry sectors such\nas healthcare, IoT, identity management and storage,\
    \ to classify the use cases of the papers\nand have discussed a few main sectors\
    \ where Blockchain is implemented.\n5.2.1. Healthcare\nResearchers have identiﬁed\
    \ that the healthcare industry is one of the primary indus-\ntries that can beneﬁt\
    \ from Blockchain technology. As it follows the distributed ledger\nconcept, medical\
    \ records can be shared easily between the hospitals/doctors/researchers\nfor\
    \ various reasons, which can easily be used for managing a patient’s data. Counterfeiting\n\
    medicines are a big concern for the pharmaceutical industry [49]. Health research\
    \ funding\nstudies have shown that 10% to 30% of drugs sold in developing countries\
    \ are counter-\nfeit [96]. The WHO reports that 16% of counterfeit products have\
    \ the wrong ingredients,\nwhile 17% have an imprecise amount of necessary ingredients\
    \ [49]. The use of these can\nlead to severe health problems and sometimes cause\
    \ death. Blockchain can be used to avoid\nthis, as it is digitally timestamped,\
    \ and information cannot be changed/tampered with.\nAs stated, the main advantage\
    \ of Blockchain in the healthcare industry is that it can\nbe used to track and\
    \ manage the patient’s data. Severe diseases require a personalized\ntreatment,\
    \ and a person cannot consult a single doctor for every disease. Hence, Blockchain\n\
    is a platform where we can share this sensitive data, and we can make sure that\
    \ it is safe\nand secure. Asaph Azaria and the team have proposed a framework\
    \ called MedRec to\nshare the medical information, which also has storage solutions\
    \ [25]. They also introduced\nthe incentives concept by asking the stakeholders\
    \ to participate in the network and verify\nas miners [25]. S. Amofa also discussed\
    \ the importance of sharing the data between doctors\nand built a framework using\
    \ Ethereum [41]. In [37], Blockchain was implemented in a\ndeveloping country,\
    \ Nepal, where, with the implementation, there was a ﬁnancial gain\nof 63%.\n\
    While it is important to share the data between the organizations, it is also\
    \ important\nfor researchers to access and analyze health information. Vero Estrada-Galinanes\
    \ and K.\nWac discussed such importance in [48] and proposed the development of\
    \ an Open Health\nArchive (OHA), a shared forum for maintaining and archiving\
    \ personal health records.\nThe importance of the research in the health care\
    \ sector is discussed in the articles [75,88]\nby the respective authors. The\
    \ research articles [77,80] discussed the importance of sharing\nthe data in the\
    \ Cloud, as PII is not allowed directly in Blockchain because of GDPR, and\nthey\
    \ have also explained it with their respective working prototypes.\nThe research\
    \ papers [70,95] examined the importance of user control over the data,\nwhich\
    \ is shared, and working models have been built using Ethereum and Hyperledger\n\
    Fabric, respectively. Emergency access to health records is discussed in [50];\
    \ it can be\nachieved with help of smart contracts. The author suggested having\
    \ a smart contract that\nwill give access to information in case of an emergency\
    \ for a limited period. SHEMB is an\nEthereum-based solution that requires a third\
    \ party in storing data using a symmetrically\nsearchable encryption technique\
    \ to speed up access to information using the patient’s\nsearch query [66].\n\
    5.2.2. IoT\nThis is another ﬁeld where Blockchain implementation can revolutionize\
    \ the world.\nIoT applications are those that are connected to the Internet and\
    \ can communicate with\neach other. Though there are many advantages of IoT devices,\
    \ the main concern is that\nthey collect sensitive information like our location,\
    \ etc., and they can be used to make or\nunderstand the behavioral patterns of\
    \ a user. Therefore, Blockchain technology integration\nwith IoT devices will\
    \ result in privacy issues being nulliﬁed.\nThe papers [26,45] discussed the implementation\
    \ of Blockchain in the IoT ﬁeld and\nthe limitations that come along with it.\
    \ Cha, S.C. and others have suggested the design\nHealthcare 2021, 9, 137\n14\
    \ of 21\nof a blockchain linked gateway that preserves user privacy preferences\
    \ for IoT devices\non the blockchain network adaptively and securely [45].To make\
    \ sure the IoT data is\nsecure, Fariza Sabrina came up with a solution that discusses\
    \ the privacy data challenge.\nAn approach is a service-oriented approach and\
    \ a mix of public Blockchain (with smart\ncontracts) and local off-chain data\
    \ for entitlement management and control [56]. The\narchitecture is implemented\
    \ using Ethereum and helps to secure conﬁdential data. In\nthe article authored\
    \ by [53], the paper discusses the importance of trust while integrating\nBlockchain\
    \ and IoT. Here, the implementation is done using Ethereum Framework, and the\n\
    decentralized network is laid between the patient, insurance provider, and hospital\
    \ instead\nof a traditional centralized network. The main disadvantage of a centralized\
    \ network is\nthat it is a time taking process, and there is no proper transparency.\n\
    5.2.3. Identity Management\nUsually, personal identity is veriﬁed using documents\
    \ such as Social Number, license,\nand passport. However, there is hardly an efﬁcient\
    \ equivalent method for protecting\nonline identities [49]. Using Blockchain,\
    \ a digital identity/ID can be created and can be\nused for online transactions\
    \ instead of using real identities. This way, we can eliminate\nthe possibility\
    \ of online fraud. Blockchain-based identity management solutions may\nallow customers\
    \ to access and validate online purchases by simply using an authentication\n\
    app instead of using a username and password or biometric system [97]. Additionally,\n\
    the self-sovereign identity concept in Blockchain is introduced by D. Baars to\
    \ eliminate\nidentity theft [98]. A new way of storing important documents related\
    \ to education is\nexplained by Alan Colman and the team in [34], and it is implemented\
    \ using Ethereum.\nThe author proposed a framework that can store the data and\
    \ authenticate the education-\nrelated documents where the authentication of documents\
    \ is done by the University or\nCollege and stored on the Blockchain. As the data\
    \ in Blockchain cannot be tampered with,\nwe can always request authentication.\
    \ Paul Dunphy et al. introduced a framework for\nidentity management, using distributed\
    \ ledger technology to improve decentralization,\naccountability, and user control\
    \ [36].\n5.2.4. Storage\nThough direct PII cannot be stored in a Blockchain network,\
    \ this can be used to store\nencrypted data. One of the main applications of Blockchain\
    \ is the ability to combine with\nthird parties like Cloud, etc., to store the\
    \ data. This enables users to have data transparency\nand the ability to track\
    \ the usage of their data. In [68], they introduced a new technique\ncalled interest\
    \ groups, where each group will hold to a ﬁeld data. Now the groups can\nsell/borrow/rent\
    \ the data that they hold. They also spoke about the rewards that could be\ngiven\
    \ for a group that offers the most relevant data. Data transparency is the main\
    \ feature.\nAs stated before, the size of a block and GDPR make it difﬁcult to\
    \ store data on Blockchain.\nTherefore, Saqib Ali and others came up with the\
    \ idea of Pinger [42]. It stores the metadata\nof the ﬁles, while the original\
    \ ﬁles are stored in various locations with the aid of a DHT\n(distributed hash\
    \ table). Using Ethereum and IPFS (InterPlanetary File System), M. Alessi\nand\
    \ the team came up with a prototype [34], which can store personal data and also\
    \ has\nrequested data service.\nThese are the main classiﬁcations that we found\
    \ in the process. There are other\nﬁelds like agriculture, where Blockchain is\
    \ used. The importance of farmer’s consent\nusing Blockchain is mentioned in [99].\
    \ Consentio [100] is a general consent management\nsystem that is built on Hyperledger\
    \ Fabric that can be used for various cases such as EHR\n(Health), small infrastructure\
    \ (IoT), and social media. Few papers also discussed the main\napplications, challenges,\
    \ and issues [27,60,63,64,81].\nHealthcare 2021, 9, 137\n15 of 21\n6. Discussion\n\
    In this section, we utilize our ﬁndings to cross-examiner the research questions\
    \ we\nhave identiﬁed in Section 4. We provide a discussion of our analysis and\
    \ address the\nlimitations of the review.\nRQ1: How does Blockchain protect user\
    \ privacy and data consent across various sectors?\nBlockchain is used in various\
    \ types of industries—healthcare, IoT, Identity Manage-\nment, etc. The most common\
    \ use cases are mentioned below in Table 3.\nTable 3. Use cases in various sectors.\n\
    Field\nUsage\nHealthcare\nTo share the medical information securely between\n\
    doctors/organizations/researchers\nIoT\nTo have the user’s privacy preference\
    \ for IoT Devices\nIdentity Management\nManagement of identity veriﬁcation\nStorage\n\
    Tamper-proof activity monitoring and data access control protection\nRQ2: What\
    \ Blockchain-based applications have been built of the described use cases?\n\
    Although the concept of Blockchain was introduced in 2008, it is still a new technology\n\
    for other sectors except for Finance. Many of the papers presented technical implementa-\n\
    tion; very few papers had a practical implementation, and few of those details\
    \ are given in\nTable 4.\nTable 4. Existing applications.\nField\nApplication\n\
    Healthcare\nMedRec [25], SHEMB [66]\nIoT\nBlockchain-enabled Security Architecture\
    \ [56]\nIdentity Management\nBlockchain as a Notarization Service [34]\nStorage\n\
    Pinger [42], Pledge [68]\nOut of the implementations that have been developed,\
    \ we have observed that Ethereum\nis the most used framework, and it is followed\
    \ by Hyperledger Fabric. The concept of\nSmart Contracts in Ethereum is one of\
    \ the main reasons it is the most used Framework.\nRQ3: How are the limitations\
    \ of current solutions addressed?\nThe main challenges are interoperability, block\
    \ size, regulations, response time, and\nthe GDPR rule “right to be forgotten”.\
    \ Interoperability is a big challenge that is being\nfaced, as we cannot operate\
    \ between two frameworks, and the integration of Blockchain\nwith legacy systems\
    \ is still an issue. After interoperability, the size of the network is a\nconcern,\
    \ as the Bitcoin network is around 270 GB, and Ethereum size already crossed 1\n\
    TB [101]. The main challenge with the size of these networks is the transaction\
    \ speed and\nvalidation process. Due to the increasing size of the networks, the\
    \ main challenge is to the\nvalidators/contributors who need to spend more money\
    \ to make their nodes run. Not only\nthe cost but also the response time of the\
    \ network is impacted due to this. Now bigger\nblocks are very much challenging\
    \ to running the network, whereas smaller blocks are\nfeasible to run and work\
    \ well with a third-party solution like Cloud. As a decentralized\nsystem, it\
    \ does not have standard regulations making it vulnerable. Coming to another\n\
    challenge in Blockchain technology is the GDPR rules that were introduced in 2018\
    \ to\nprotect the PII of European Nations. It means that a person is entitled\
    \ to ask the data to be\nerased. But Blockchain being immutable, it is impossible\
    \ to erase data from the network.\nFinally, there are a few security concerns\
    \ with the existing applications. A potential breach\ncould leak all the user’s\
    \ data, as there have been several attacks on certain Blockchain\napplications.\
    \ There is also a risk of identifying a user when there is adequate information\n\
    available on the network.\nHealthcare 2021, 9, 137\n16 of 21\nThere are few networks\
    \ such as Cosmos [102] and Polkadot [103] that came up with\nthe solution for\
    \ interoperability. As a part of the Cosmos network, independent networks\n(called\
    \ zones) are connected through the Cosmos Hub. Additionally, Ethereum 2 (also\n\
    known as Serenity) solves a few critical issues with the introduction of concepts\
    \ such as\nsubchain and POS (Proof of Stake) [104]. These features now enable\
    \ a person to maintain\nsmall transactions without mining, which reduces the bloating\
    \ problem. With the help\nof the subchain, now the transactions will be cheaper\
    \ and quicker. Additionally, the 51%\npercent attack can be avoided with the POS\
    \ concept, as a person/miner with more than 51\npercent of control would not want\
    \ to attack their network. Additionally, erasing data from\nlocal storage is possible,\
    \ as we do not store the PII on the network. This has been explained\nby M. Florian\
    \ in [63]. The author suggested an approach where we can completely delete\nthe\
    \ undesirable data from local nodes. By this, we can ensure the GDPR rule, which\
    \ is\nthe right to be forgotten. Additionally, only a few nodes can participate\
    \ in the consensus\nand validation processes to boost the efﬁciency of the system\
    \ and increase the processing\nspeed [105]. Currently, more extensive research\
    \ is going to improve the current standards\nand conditions of Blockchain technology\
    \ to make it more useful. Permissioned Blockchain\nshould be used instead of the\
    \ public Blockchains to avoid attacks and sharing of the data.\nTo protect the\
    \ user information on the network, encryption technologies are being used,\nand\
    \ techniques are also to be updated periodically.\nRQ4: What are the major challenges\
    \ for future research?\nBlockchain solves many real-world problems, such as data\
    \ authentication, data storage,\nand data privacy. It is still in the early stages\
    \ of implementation, as there are not many\nworking prototypes at this moment.\
    \ Therefore, extensive research is going in every ﬁeld\nto implement this technology,\
    \ especially in the ﬁeld of data management, as we believe\nthat it can eliminate\
    \ the process of ﬁlling up forms, as the data can be shared between any\ndepartments/organizations\
    \ securely. More working models are needed to come up with\nthe best practice\
    \ to implement for managing the data; for this reason, the prototypes must\nbe\
    \ tested thoroughly. We believe it will play a crucial role in the future healthcare,\
    \ IoT, data\nstorage, identity management, and Telecom sectors, respectively.\
    \ Additionally, to make\nsure the new working prototypes are approachable to the\
    \ people, there is a need for a few\nregulations to be introduced.\nOne of the\
    \ main focuses is also on the interoperability of the frameworks. Apart from\n\
    interoperability, the other main challenges that need to be worked upon are security\
    \ and\nprivacy; the speed of adding blocks to a network is one constant area that\
    \ also needs to be\nchecked. These are a few areas where there are open research\
    \ questions. It is also highly\nessential that Blockchain complies with all the\
    \ regulations set by GDPR. By meeting all the\nrequirements, it will give a boost\
    \ to the companies to integrate into their existing solutions.\nLimitations of\
    \ the Review\nDespite the various beneﬁts of conducting a systematic analysis,\
    \ certain drawbacks\nneed to be considered: bias in the collection, bias in publication,\
    \ imprecision in the extrac-\ntion of data, and misclassiﬁcation [23]. To eliminate\
    \ the bias, we investigated the papers\nirrespective of novelty or unremarkable\
    \ outcomes. To achieve a maximum possible number\nof papers, an efﬁcient search\
    \ protocol was developed for research papers, followed by a\nsearch with all alternative\
    \ keywords. Moreover, criteria for inclusion and exclusion have\nbeen established\
    \ to ensure that the papers included are focused on research topics that are\n\
    well linked to the research goals.\nInaccuracies in the extraction of data and\
    \ misjudgments may be attributed to the\nreviewer’s failure to accurately retrieve\
    \ information and data from its records. We have\nused an Excel sheet throughout\
    \ the process to make sure all the extracted data have been\nproperly recorded.\n\
    Healthcare 2021, 9, 137\n17 of 21\n7. Conclusions and Future Work\nBlockchain\
    \ is an evolving technology that will revolutionize the information technol-\n\
    ogy world, because it can be applied in many applications domains where an immutable\n\
    ledger is useful. To evaluate the applications of blockchain to consent management\
    \ and\nprivate data management, we have conducted this systematic review using\
    \ the PRISMA\nguidelines to identify the current solutions, limitations and research\
    \ challenges. Overall, 73\npapers were studied in detail to perform this review.\n\
    Our study indicates that Blockchain has been implemented in various ﬁelds such\
    \ as\nhealthcare, IoT, data storage, and management. Many prototypes have been\
    \ developed and\nare already tested in real-world scenarios. More research is\
    \ being conducted on this, and in\nthe future, more research will be done to understand\
    \ and evaluate the implementations.\nFurther research is aimed at solving the\
    \ issues associated with the use of blockchain\ntechnology such as scalability,\
    \ latency, interoperability, privacy, and security.\nAuthor Contributions: Writing—original\

    Under a Creative Commons license open access Abstract Blockchain is today one
    of the most interesting and debated research topics. Blockchain technology was
    implemented for the first time in the financial sector a few years ago. However,
    it is currently used in many other areas, such as: healthcare, smart cities, smart
    contracts, energy markets, government sector. The success of this technology mainly
    lies in the following properties: reliability, transparency, immutability. In
    this study, we collect and analyze the main contributions in the literature about
    the application of blockchain in the agricultural sector, focusing on food traceability
    issues. Considering the quick growth of this technology and the high number of
    published documents in recent months, there is a need to catalog the different
    methodologies, proposed by the various scholars. Our aim is to detect the current
    research trends and possible future challenges. In the agricultural context, the
    need for an adequate traceability system is motivated by several bad habits and
    problems, such as the wide use of pesticides and fertilizers in fruits and vegetables,
    which are extremely harmful for human health. Moreover, in the last few years,
    the consumers’ attention about the quality of agricultural products has considerably
    increased. The present study shows that the blockchain technology is still in
    its early stage. Although there are several proposals in the literature, still
    a limited number of applications have been put into use in the real context. From
    the point of view of scientific research, only some countries are investing in
    this technology: China and United States are among the most active, but Italy
    is also very involved in this phenomenon. Overall, the blockchain technology appears
    very promising, but still many efforts are needed to reach the maturation stage.

    \ the issues of privacy and security in resource-constrained IoT devices.\n\n\
    The key advantages of blockchain that make it suitable for securing IoT devices\
    \ include:\n\n•\tDecentralization: Blockchain is a decentralized system, which\
    \ means that there is no central authority controlling the network. This eliminates\
    \ single points of failure and makes it more resistant to cyberattacks.\n\n•\t\
    Immutability: Once data is added to a blockchain, it is extremely difficult to\
    \ tamper with or delete it. This immutability ensures the integrity and reliability\
    \ of data stored on the blockchain.\n\n•\tConsensus: Blockchain uses consensus\
    \ mechanisms to validate and add new blocks to the chain. This ensures that all\
    \ participants in the network agree on the state of the blockchain.\n\n•\tTransparency:\
    \ Blockchain transactions are recorded on a public ledger, which makes them transparent\
    \ and auditable. This transparency helps to build trust and accountability in\
    \ the system."

    Abstract: With opportunities brought by Internet of Things (IoT), it is quite\
    \ a challenge to assure\nprivacy preservation when a huge number of resource-constrained\
    \ distributed devices is involved.\nBlockchain has become popular for its beneﬁts,\
    \ including decentralization, persistence, immutability,\nauditability and consensus.\
    \ With the implementation of blockchain in IoT, the beneﬁts provided by\nblockchain\
    \ can be derived in order to make IoT more efﬁcient and maintain trust. In this\
    \ paper, we\ndiscuss some applications of IoT in different ﬁelds and privacy-related\
    \ issues faced by IoT in resource-\nconstrained devices. We discuss some applications\
    \ of blockchain in vast majority of areas, and the\nopportunities it brings to\
    \ resolve IoT privacy limitations. We, then, survey different researches based\n\
    on the implementation of blockchain in IoT. The goal of this paper is to survey\
    \ recent researches\nbased on the implementation of blockchain in IoT for privacy\
    \ preservation. After analyzing the\nrecent solutions, we see that the blockchain\
    \ is an optimal way for preventing identity disclosure,\nmonitoring, and providing\
    \ tracking in IoT.\nKeywords: blockchain; consensus; IoT; smart contracts; bitcoin\n\
    1. Introduction\nWith the recent advancements in the ﬁeld of Information Technology,\
    \ a complex\nsystem called IoT evolved. It consists of several computing devices\
    \ connected with each\nother through Internet and able to process and transfer\
    \ data among each other with minimal\nhuman interaction needed. This system grew\
    \ rapidly as the devices kept increasing and\nnumber of links increased automatically.\
    \ Cisco Inc. predicted 50 billion devices by 2020,\nand it is still growing. IoT\
    \ applications are increasing the level of convenience and efﬁciency\nin everyday\
    \ life at low costs. For example, home automation and healthcare systems. An\n\
    overview of IoT is given in Section 2.\nHowever, with huge growth in the number\
    \ of devices in IoT, the challenges also\nkeep increasing. IoT devices can be\
    \ as small as a watch; apart from processing, storage\nand networking limitations\
    \ faced by such IoT devices, security is a serious concern of\nresearchers and\
    \ technicians. The growing number of devices makes attack surface broader.\nThese\
    \ security and privacy issues make IoT less trustworthy for organizations that\
    \ have\nsensitive data and maintaining customer’s privacy and data security are\
    \ their top priorities.\nAlso it becomes hard to manage a large number of devices\
    \ and to have an consensus\nbetween them.\nIoT’s privacy and security with interconnected\
    \ devices causes security challenges in\nthe area of network computing. It means\
    \ at any moment from anywhere, an attack can be\nElectronics 2021, 10, 1732. https://doi.org/10.3390/electronics10141732\n\

    launched on these devices that includes threats like denial of service, fabrication\
    \ of identity,\nphysical threats, communication channel targeting and many more.\
    \ One of the biggest\nchallenges in this research ﬁeld is consumption of power\
    \ resources and computational\noverheads on IoT devices. Many solutions have been\
    \ proposed by the researchers in which\nstrategies based on blockchain, homomorphic\
    \ encryption, and attribute-based encryption\nare provided.\nThe exchange of data\
    \ among physically connected devices related to their infras-\ntructure and behaviors\
    \ in the form of groups is known as IoT. From the Gartner report\nshown in Table\
    \ 1, it was expected that almost 5.8 Billion interconnected devices would be\n\
    having a vast share in market of $3 trillion in 2020 [1], while the forecasts\
    \ of international\ndata co-operation report that the expected market value of\
    \ IoT devices is $1.1 trillion for\n2023—the market of full stack systems, like\
    \ RIOT [2] and Contiki [3] that enabled IoT\ndevices functionality, is also expected\
    \ to expand.\nTable 1. IoT endpoint market by segment, 2018–2020, worldwide (in\

    \ in various domains. IoT devices play a\nhuge role in different aspects of life,\
    \ for example security, energy, safety, healthcare, smart\ngrid, VANETs, industry\
    \ and entertainment, but in terms of battery power, network proto-\ncol, complex\
    \ computation and infrequent connectivity, these devices are fundamentally\nconstrained\
    \ in resources.\nIoT bears the risk of not having a standard security scheme implementation,\
    \ which\nresults in security concerns like data misuse [2,3]. IoT devices collect\
    \ personal information\nof a user such as his identity, contact number, energy\
    \ consumed, and location. These\ndevices also reveal a user’s behavior, by collecting\
    \ information about his lifestyle and\ndaily activities—including watching movies,\
    \ playing games, home activities, gatherings,\netc. Therefore, the exposure of\
    \ the user’s personal data to non-trusted private and public\nservers can pose\
    \ serious privacy-related issues, and the data gathered by these devices\ncan\
    \ be misused against the user. These threats make it crucial to focus on the security\
    \ and\nprivacy designs of IoT devices.\nSince the application of blockchain in\
    \ bitcoin cryptocurrency [4], it has become quite\npopular. Blockchain is being\
    \ deployed in a large number of ﬁelds, such as education,\nhealthcare, banking,\
    \ agriculture, etc., for the opportunities that it brings.\nOne of the most important\
    \ features of blockchain is decentralization. It is also used\nas a consensus\
    \ mechanism to enable trust between all parties involved in decentralized\nnetworks,\
    \ one example is cryptocurrency—for example, Bitcoin and Ethereum. IoT devices\n\
    are decentralized and hence can be beneﬁted by the blockchain.\nThere are many\
    \ survey papers recently published that cover various aspects of\nblockchain in\
    \ different environments [5–9]. Bitcoin overview was presented in [6] by\nSankar\
    \ et al. [7], in which challenges related to blockchain research are presented.\
    \ Re-\ncently, in [10], an overview of blockchain-based IoT applications is presented.\
    \ In [11],\na comprehensive discussion about blockchain applications and framework\
    \ implementa-\ntions has been presented by Gao et al. The authors in [12] provide\
    \ smart contract-based\nElectronics 2021, 10, 1732\n3 of 26\nblockchain-dependent\
    \ banking ledgers transactions overview. In many smart applications\nimplementing\
    \ blockchain, a systematic survey was provided in [13]. An overview of\nblockchain\
    \ security services like conﬁdentiality, privacy, access control and authentication\n\
    has been given by Salman et al. in [14].\nMany surveys on IoT security and Privacy-related\
    \ issues and their solutions have been\npublished. An analysis of privacy issues\
    \ in IoT is given by Ziegeldorf et al. in [15]. The\nfocus of this survey is on\
    \ classiﬁcation of privacy and security challenges in IoT devices.\nThe challenges\
    \ faced by industrial IoT devices are introduced by Sadeghi et al. in [16].\n\
    In [17], security-related challenges and their solutions are discussed. The authors\
    \ have\ncategorized security-related issues in mobile devices based on authenticity,\
    \ conﬁdentiality,\ntrust, security, and access control. The ongoing research challenges\
    \ and their status is\ndiscussed by Suo et al. [18]. Privacy preservation mechanisms\
    \ based on encryption have\nalso been discussed and some mechanisms are developed\
    \ for private communication.\nMany solutions have been proposed by the researchers\
    \ recently for integration of\nblockchain in different IoT applications. The integration\
    \ of blockchain with IoT and the\npros and cons of this integration are examined\
    \ by Christidis and Devetsikiotis in [19], and\nAtzori et al. in [20], whereas\
    \ a comprehensive survey on IoT applications is presented\nin [21] by Conoscenti\
    \ et al. For IoT decentralization, certain challenges and solutions are\nprovided\
    \ by the authors. In [22], blockchain-based IoT research opportunities, challenges\n\
    and different architectures are discussed by Reyna et al. In [23], blockchain-based\
    \ IoT with\nedge centric technology solutions have been discuss by Yeow et al.\
    \ For security and privacy\nin blockchain-based IoT, a survey is presented in\
    \ [10] by Fernendaz et al. A research done\nby Panarello et al. involves smart\
    \ grid and smart cities in [24].\nRecently, a survey on publicly deployed blockchain\
    \ on different network principals\nhas been provided by Neudecker and Hartenstein,\
    \ in which design trade-offs of public\nblockchain and potential attacks are also\
    \ presented [25]. The privacy issues in blockchain\nand their solutions are presented\
    \ in [26,27]. The authors provided literature review com-\nprehensively on privacy\
    \ aspects of blockchain with their solution strategies and presented\na zero knowledge\
    \ proof, signature and cryptographic approaches analysis in [26]. Whereas\nin\
    \ [27], Feng et al. presented privacy issues insights in a detailed manner, technical\
    \ details\nsummary and different defence mechanism were analyzed.\nIn this paper,\
    \ we survey the deployment of blockchain in constrained IoT devices in\norder\
    \ to achieve privacy and security.\nIn Section 2, we present an overview of IoT,\
    \ its applications and privacy-related\nchallenges. We present an overview of\
    \ blockchain technology in Section 3, and we highlight\nsome applications and\
    \ strengths of blockchain. In the same section, We highlight different\nconsensus\
    \ mechanisms used by blockchain, and smart contracts that come with it. A\nreview\
    \ of applications of blockchain in IoT is presented in Section 4. At different\
    \ layers of\nIoT, privacy mechanisms and issues are analyzed. Future challenges\
    \ and their solutions\nare provided in Section 6. The conclusion of our paper\
    \ is provided in Section 5. Future\ndirections are given in Section 6.\nAll the\
    \ researches highlighted above have mainly discussed strengths and limitations\n\
    of either blockchain or IoT. Many researches are based on the integration of blockchain\n\
    in IoT to achieve consensus, decentralization, or smart contracts. While there\
    \ are a huge\nnumber of surveys that discuss the security parameters, such as\
    \ integrity, non-repudiation,\ntransparency and immutability, provided by blockchain\
    \ to IoT, this survey focuses mainly\non privacy preservation in resource-constrained\
    \ IoT devices using blockchain. In this\nsurvey, we present state-of-the-art literature\
    \ on privacy preservation assurance in IoT using\nblockchain. Contributions of\
    \ this survey, as compared to other surveys, are as follows.\n•\nWe highlight\
    \ some applications of IoT in different ﬁelds and see how much it impacts\nour\
    \ lives and how crucial it is to preserve user privacy in IoT.\n•\nWe highlight\
    \ privacy-related issues faced by IoT. We discuss the literature on tech-\nniques\

    \ to show how it is\nbeing used in different industries. We highlight the strengths\
    \ of blockchain that IoT\ncan beneﬁt from.\n•\nWe provide an analysis on the integration\
    \ of blockchain in IoT systems. We mainly\nfocus on blockchain’s potential to\
    \ preserve data privacy in IoT scenario.\n•\nWe provide future directions on privacy\
    \ preservation in IoT.\n2. Internet of Things\n2.1. Overview\nIoT is a system\
    \ formed by the connection of multiple uniquely identiﬁed devices, such\nas computers,\
    \ smartphones, sensors, software, cars, vending machines, thermostats, etc., to\n\
    process and share data without the need of a human interaction. It relies on the\
    \ Internet for\ncommunication purposes among these devices [28] to keep the data\
    \ synchronized. The\ndevices can be controlled remotely to perform desired actions.\n\
    Kevin Ashton used the term “Internet for things” for the ﬁrst time in 1999. Originally\n\
    it was called “Internet for things” and then it became “Internet of things”. Since\
    \ then, this\nframework became popular for the convenience it brought into everyday\
    \ life. Today there\nare billions of IoT devices operating in a large number of\
    \ ﬁelds (Figure 1). Although it is\nnot feasible to discuss all applications of\
    \ IoT, but Figure 1 shows some ﬁelds, including\nmilitary [29,30], industry [31],\
    \ smart cities [32], consumer [33], security [34] and home\nautomation [35], and\
    \ respective IoT applications. With time, IoT has become more human-\nfriendly\
    \ by processing large amounts of data with minimal human efforts put. Today IoT\
    \ is\nnot just limited to the personal use, but it is being used to detect weather,\
    \ monitor surgeries,\nmanage energy, monitor environment and manage transportation.\n\
    Figure 1. Applications of IoT.\nElectronics 2021, 10, 1732\n5 of 26\n2.2. Characteristics\
    \ of IoT\n•\nIntelligence: A lot of IoT devices are set to perform some speciﬁc\
    \ actions when\nneed arises, such as generating an alarm when a wearable sensor\
    \ senses a high blood\npressure for a patient. The decisions taken by a certain\
    \ device depend on the sensitivity.\nArtiﬁcial intelligence and machine learning\
    \ are making IoT devices smarter.\n•\nComplexity: There is a huge number of devices,\
    \ links, and actors in IoT, that keep\nincreasing on a rapid rate.\n•\nHeterogeneity:\
    \ The devices are different from each other on the basis of hardware,\nsoftware\
    \ and networks.\n•\nConnectivity: The devices in IoT are connected with each other\
    \ through Internet to\nshare data. For example, the sensors used to collect patient\
    \ data on regular intervals\nneed to transmit this data to the concerned medical\
    \ personnel [36]. The state of data\nand devices keep changing. Therefore, it\
    \ is important to keep the devices synchronized.\n•\nInteroperability: The IoT\
    \ devices are different from each other in nature but yet\ncompatible when it\
    \ comes to performing the tasks that involve the use of multiple\ndevices at the\
    \ same time.\n•\nDecentralization: IoT comprises of billions of devices connected\
    \ with each other using\nthe Internet throughout the globe. No one “owns” IoT.\
    \ The elements such as access,\ncontrol and ownership are spread across the actors/nodes\
    \ that make up IoT.\n2.3. Privacy-Related Issues in IoT\nThe environment saturation\
    \ with smart objects to perform daily tasks is provided\nby IoT. Sensors, micro\
    \ controllers and transmitters that exchange and transmit data refer\nto nonstandard\
    \ networking devices, which enable decision making support and smart\ninteractions.\
    \ For the collection and exchange of surroundings’ data in industrial and\nconsumer’s\
    \ devices, IoT is planted. IoT is remotely controlled via Internet or directly,\n\
    which causes physical environmental changes. The safeguard protection techniques\
    \ and\ncollection of data in IoT are much lower than the momentum at which the\
    \ devices are\ndeveloped for customer use.\n2.3.1. IoT Device Limitations\nResource\
    \ constrained devices have a certain capability of weight, size and network\n\
    connection, which directly impacts the complexity of IoT devices in data rates,\
    \ unreliable\nlinks, packet sizes and power consumption. Many challenges in IoT\
    \ environment are\npointed out by various scholars.\nThe main challenge is preserving\
    \ user privacy and their employed status with other\nconnected smart objects.\
    \ The smart objects that IoT uses are continuously producing data,\nit becomes\
    \ more complex as these objects become anonymous. The objects’ interaction\nwith\
    \ each other is one the most important aspects of IoT security.\nA privacy preservation\
    \ approach in a multiple IoT scheme has been proposed by\nthe Serena et al. in\
    \ [37], which prevents feature disclosure. The approach is based on\nt-closeness\
    \ and k-anonymity notions from the database theory. These two notions derive\n\
    group’s robustness from privacy expectations. It prevents feature disclosure as\
    \ well as\ninformation disclosure. Their scheme also protects from disruptive\
    \ effects that occur from\nthe malicious objects analysis. The key point in this\
    \ paper is multi-network representation\nwhich depends on the correspondence on\
    \ network of every identiﬁed group. In terms\nof node, every object can be modeled.\
    \ Same group relationships between objects inside\nthe present communication network\
    \ are known as inner arcs, while in different group\nrelationships they are known\
    \ as cross arcs.\nSome statistics of compromised IoT are given in Table 2. Shodan\
    \ [38], Zoomeye and\nCensys are popular search engines for IoT devices vulnerabilities.\
    \ The observations made\nby authors regarding IoTs include host-based approaches\
    \ being more vulnerable than\nnetwork-based in IoT platform, and traditional security\
    \ measures for IoT devices are not\nproperly secure. The main challenge is that\
    \ the devices are resource constrained. Other\nElectronics 2021, 10, 1732\n6 of\
    \ 26\nthan blockchain, many solutions have also been proposed for privacy preservation\
    \ in IoT,\nincluding holochain [39,40], machine learning [41,42], IOTA [43,44],\
    \ and intrusion detection\nsystem [45].\nTable 2. Statistics of broken IoT [38].\n\

    \ Impact on IoT\nIn the design of IoT protocols, heterogeneity plays a vital role.\
    \ Interaction of resource-\nconstrained IoT devices such as cloudlets, web servers\
    \ and blockchain either involve\ngateways or direct communication. The lightweight\
    \ security mechanisms need to be imple-\nmented for secure end-to-end communication,\
    \ as access policy and data summarization\nrelated mechanisms that enable transparency\
    \ are controlling our lives silently. Figure 2\nshows heterogeneous structure\
    \ of IoT. It includes four layers; sensors, networks, cloud\nservers and consumer\

    \ the architecture of IoT provides sensing information for cloud\ncomputing to\
    \ make appropriate decisions by recording and monitoring user data\nwith the help\
    \ of different kind of sensors e.g. color, camera, motion, ﬂame, etc. Node\nlocation\

    address by smart sensor nodes.\n•\nNetworking: For forwarding data from source\

    \ which, higher transmission rates are provided by\nthe network models like hybrid,\
    \ star, mesh, and tree networks. The transmission of\ndata through super nodes\
    \ and relay units to cloud servers is done by network mod-\nels. They also manage\
    \ efﬁcient construction mechanisms. Data throughput, energy\nconsumption and malicious\
    \ attacks are the limitations of network models.\n•\nCloud Computing: Heterogeneous\

    \ Its main function is to receive and transmit data to and\nfrom other architecture\

    \ in [47] discuss key technologies of industry 14.0, including IIoT. The structure\n\
    of IIoT technology is shown, including four layers; sensing layer, network layer,\
    \ service\nlayer and interface layer. Authors show that IIoT requires real-time\
    \ data availability and\nhigh reliability, unlike IoT, to increase product efﬁciency.\n\
    2.5. IoT’s Security Mechanism Deployment\nTo preserve Conﬁdentiality, infrastructure,\
    \ data integrity, security and privacy, strong\nsecurity mitigation mechanisms\
    \ are required. Figure 3 shows trends of methods used\nby researchers for countermeasures\
    \ and mitigation of attacks in IoT. Figure 3 shows that\nauthentication is most\
    \ popular security technique which is used by 49%, almost half of\nother techniques\
    \ altogether, trust management is second most popular technique due to\ndetection\
    \ and prevention abilities while blockchain is the last.\nFigure 3. IoT security\

    Privacy protection\n*\nIoT with blockchain integration beneﬁts the users with\
    \ decentralized nature of re-\nsources, low operational cost and robust behavior.\
    \ Blockchain, a technology based on\ndistributed ledger, initially developed for\
    \ cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, provides integrity,\nimmutability, decentralization,\
    \ transparency and pseudonymity. Satoshi Nakamato [4] in\n2008 introduced the\
    \ bitcoin technology using blockchain. Since then, blockchain gained\nattention\
    \ for decentralized nature of data sharing and distributed network of computing.\n\
    Through adoption of cryptographic technology with decentralized control and storage\
    \ of\ndata in the system, controlling attacks can be avoided.\nDue to uniqueness\
    \ and advanced features like immutability, integrity, transparency,\nauthorization,\
    \ auditability and transactional privacy, blockchain has been used in different\n\
    sectors before cryptocurrencies. Identity management[69], mobile crowd sensing\
    \ [70],\nInternet of energy [11,71–73], agriculture [74], supply chain management\
    \ and industry\n4.0 [75,76] are some areas of it.\nFigure 4 shows the structure\
    \ of blockchain, which is a combination of different blocks\nlinking together\
    \ in a linear fashion. In a peer-to-peer network of blockchain nodes, digital\n\
    signed transactions are maintained in a public ledger. Two types of keys are used\
    \ in\nblockchain, public key is used for encryption of data while the corresponding\
    \ private key is\nused to decrypt the ciphertext. A user also uses private key\
    \ for signing and public key for\nunique addressing. Transaction broadcasting\
    \ and signing are done at the initial stage. When\ntransaction is received by\
    \ the peers, validation of transaction and its dissemination over the\nnetwork\
    \ takes place. To achieve consensus, validation of the newly issued transactions\
    \ is\ndone by all the nodes present in the network. Miners act like special nodes\
    \ in a distributed\nconsensus that participate in transaction issuance. The block,\
    \ once generated, is broadcast\nby the miners in the network. In this way, every\
    \ node in the network has a copy of the\ntransaction and can verify it. Veriﬁcation\
    \ only involves computing a hash, which is not\ncomputationally expensive as opposed\
    \ to transaction generation, this is why any node in\nthe network can verify a\
    \ transaction.\nBlockchain is divided into three categories, public blockchain,\
    \ which is permission-\nless, private blockchain, which is permissioned and consortium\
    \ blockchain, which is a\ncombination of both. All types provide immunity against\
    \ malicious and faulty ledger\nusers. Table 4 shows properties of all four types\
    \ of blockchain. Their detailed example is\npresented in [10] by T. M. Fernández\
    \ et al. Strengths of blockchain include accuracy, cost\nreduction, decentralization,\
    \ efﬁciency, immutability, transparency and privacy.\nElectronics 2021, 10, 1732\n\

    \ Nowadays, in industries [77], investments are made in a huge amounts.\nTechnical\
    \ issues and challenges related to blockchain technology are gaining signiﬁcant\n\
    interest of researchers. Some challenges include forking, consensus protocol targeting,\
    \ 51%\nvulnerability and problems with the creation of new blockchain [78]. Another\
    \ important\nchallenge is the huge amount of power required for blockchain maintenance.\n\
    Electronics 2021, 10, 1732\n10 of 26\n3.2. Applications\nBlockchain is being used\
    \ in a number of ﬁelds in our everyday life. Some of the\napplications are discussed\
    \ here.\nFigure 5 shows some applications of blockchain in different ﬁelds, including\
    \ IoT,\nhealthcare, ﬁnance, agriculture and cryptocurrency.\nIn IoT, blockchain\
    \ is used to secure smart appliances [79,80] and supply chain man-\nagement [81].\
    \ In healthcare, applications of blockchain include medical supply chain [82],\n\
    drug traceability [83], secure record keeping [84], patient identity validation\
    \ [85] and smart\ncontracts [86,87]. In ﬁnance industry, the blockchain solutions\
    \ include insurance [88],\npayments [89], asset management [90] and real estate\
    \ management in smart cities [91].\nIn agriculture industry, some of blockchain\
    \ applications include food supply chain [92],\nagriculture insurance [93] and\
    \ smart farming [94,95]. Cryptoccurrency applications of\nblockchain include bitcoin\
    \ and ethereum.\nFigure 5. Applications of Blockchain.\nAlthough it is infeasible\
    \ to discuss all applications, we describe some of the most\nimportant applications\
    \ of blockchain in the following subsections.\n3.2.1. Banking\nAs blockchain ensures\
    \ secure storage and immutability, it makes exchanging of funds\nmore secure.\
    \ Transactions, using blockchain, become transparent and private.\nIn [96], the\
    \ authors have discussed the strengths of blockchain integration in com-\nmercial\
    \ banking. This research analyzes the advantages for different aspects, including\n\
    overseas payments, billing operations and asset security. The authors have concluded\n\
    that the blockchain technology has the potential to decrease transaction costs\
    \ and provide\nbetter efﬁciency.\nA theoretical model is proposed in [97] in order\
    \ to analyze the pattern, which allows\nenterprises to assess bank loans using\
    \ blockchain. The authors demonstrate that blockchain\nElectronics 2021, 10, 1732\n\
    11 of 26\nallows consensus regarding the debt payments and other activities including\
    \ lending\nand borrowing. This results in low-risk and high-quality of a small\
    \ and medium sized\nenterprise’s credibility.\nIn [98], Wang et al. proposed a\
    \ model called IBPS (Inter-Bank Payment System)\nthat utilizes Hyperledger Fabric\
    \ enterprise blockchain technology. The proposed model\nprovides efﬁciency and\
    \ secure payment services.\n3.2.2. Healthcare\nHealthcare industry is beneﬁting\
    \ from blockchain in many ways. Medical records\ncan be stored in blockchain to\
    \ be made more secure. The interaction among different\nIoT devices and wearable\
    \ sensors is crucial in healthcare systems. There are systems that\nimmediately\
    \ notify the medical personnel upon an “event”. An example of this event could\n\
    be high sugar in a patient detected by a device that she is wearing.\nThe advantages\
    \ of using blockchain in healthcare IoT are numerous, including security\nof records,\
    \ secure management of data, privacy preservation of sensitive data, reliable\n\
    remote monitoring of patients, non-repudiation, immutability and decentralization,\
    \ as\npointed out by [52]. The authors point out that most blockchain-based healthcare\
    \ solu-\ntions use Ethereum platform. It is also shown that the healthcare systems\
    \ mostly utilize\nprivate blockchain.\nA blockchain-based framework is proposed\
    \ in [99] that allows continuous patient\nmonitoring using IoT. This scheme provides\
    \ role-based access control and improves security\nand authentication in patient’s\
    \ smart devices.\nTo resolve issues regarding data sharing, scalability and quality\
    \ of service, a blockchain-\nbased solution is proposed in [100]. The proposed\
    \ scheme is called ssHealth (smart and\nsecure Healthcare system). This scheme\
    \ allows remote monitoring of students while\naddressing the issues mentioned\
    \ above.\nIn order to resolve security and privacy related challenges, a blockchain-based\
    \ scheme\nis proposed in [101], which utilizes consortium blockchain in addition\
    \ to a new consensus\nalgorithm called MBFT (Mixed Byzantine Fault Tolerance).\
    \ The proposed scheme provides\nprivacy, fault tolerance and and better transaction\
    \ handling. In [102], a scheme is proposed\nto eliminate single-point-of-failure,\
    \ man-in-the-middle and data snifﬁng attacks using\npublic blockchain. This scheme\
    \ preserves data privacy, provides immutability and efﬁcient\nidentity management.\n\
    3.2.3. Supply Chain\nBlockchain is used by suppliers to record the supplies purchased\
    \ or to be purchased.\nAn advantage provided by default by blockchain beneﬁts\
    \ supply chain greatly, which is\nnon-repudiation. Due to non-repudiation, a buyer\
    \ cannot deny purchasing materials from\na seller.\nIn [103], a multi-ledger tracking\
    \ framework is proposed that simpliﬁes supply chain\nmanagement. The proposed\
    \ framework consists of two layers; layer 1 uses multiple private\nsub-ledgers\
    \ and layer 2 utilizes a public ledger. A single shipment is represented by the\n\
    sub-ledgers. Public ledger is used to track information, which is publicly available.\
    \ The\nframework consists of index server, peers, admin node and external monitoring\
    \ nodes.\nA record of all activities is maintained by the admin node. The index\
    \ server stores the\naddresses of the nodes in the network, peers include nodes,\
    \ admin node is used to keep\nrecord of all networking activities and external\
    \ nodes verify and track the shipment status.\nChen et al. have proposed a blockchain-based\
    \ conceptual framework in [103] to\nimprove supply chain management. The proposed\
    \ framework consists of four layers; IoT\nsensors layer, data layer, contract\
    \ layer and business layer. In this way, the functionalities\nof each service\
    \ are provided. Sensor layer is used to track the goods, data layer consists of\n\
    blockchain and smart contracts, the contract layer ensures data quality and contract\
    \ layer\nexecutes the processes related to business management.\nElectronics 2021,\
    \ 10, 1732\n12 of 26\n3.2.4. Electronic Voting\nElection fraud is prevented using\
    \ blockchain. Blockchain in voting works in the way\nthat a block is added to\
    \ the blockchain upon a successful vote. As blockchain brings\nimmutability and\
    \ integrity, it ensures that the records cannot be changed. Voting also\nbeneﬁts\
    \ from transparency that blockchain brings, as the records are kept transparent\
    \ in\nthe network. In this subsection, we brieﬂy discuss the strengths of blockchain-based\
    \ voting\nschemes proposed in recent literature. Blockchain-based electronic voting\
    \ is discussed in\ndetail in [53]. This survey reviews the literature and discusses\
    \ its strengths and limitations.\nThe authors point out that transparency and\
    \ decentralization are most useful features of\nblockchain to be used by electronic\
    \ voting systems, whereas limitations include scalability\nissues and coercion\
    \ resistance.\nIn [104], a blockchain-based transparent ballot box protocol has\
    \ been proposed that\nfollows e-voting properties and provides decentralization.\
    \ The proposed scheme allows\nthe elector to modify the vote in allowed voting\
    \ phase. A protocol has been proposed\nin [105] called VYV (Verify Your Vote)\
    \ based on blockchain. This protocol provides fairness,\nvote privacy and veriﬁability.\
    \ In [106], a scheme is proposed to eliminate the need of\na third party and decentralize\
    \ the voting network using blockchain. The strengths of\nthis scheme include public\
    \ veriﬁability, consistency, auditability, transparency and user\nanonymity. A\
    \ blockchain-based protocol is proposed in [107] that utilizes homomorphic\nElGamal\
    \ encryption. The authors claim that their scheme guarantees privacy preservation\n\
    and anonymity.\n3.2.5. Smart Cities\nBlockchain smart contracts can be integrated\
    \ with properties like cars, houses, patents,\netc. Decentralization, immutability,\
    \ pseudonymity and transparency are useful features of\nblockchain for smart cities.\
    \ In [51], authors review recent literature on blockchain-based\nenergy consumption\
    \ systems. Authors conclude that energy consumption in smart cities\ncan be made\
    \ efﬁcient using blockchain, because blockchain provides decentralization,\nanonymity,\
    \ transparency, and tamper-prooﬁng.\nIn [108], blockchain is used to propose personal\
    \ archive storage scheme to provide\nauthenticity, accuracy and transparency.\
    \ The different actors in the proposed scheme\ninclude subject, certiﬁer, client\
    \ and stake node. Subject owns digital artifacts, certiﬁer issues\na certiﬁcate\
    \ to the subject, client is someone who requests to access personal digital artifacts\n\
    and stake node maintains blockchain ledger. This scheme provides secure storage\
    \ and\nefﬁcient authentication.\nIn [109], a blockchain-based framework called\
    \ BC-PDS (Blockchain-based Personal\nData Store) has been proposed for personal\
    \ data storage. This scheme utilizes existing\nOpenPDS/SafeAnswers framework.\
    \ For anonymization, this scheme uses AutoNomy-\nbased Access Control (ANAC).\n\
    3.3. Smart Contracts\nIn public blockchain, all participating nodes have the privilege\
    \ to deploy smart con-\ntracts without needing any prerequisites. In Ethereum,\
    \ solidity language is used for\ncreating contracts while Metamask is used for\
    \ ID creation and Remix IDE is used for its\nonline demonstration and results\
    \ of applications.\nComputer programs and codes that can work anonymously are\
    \ known as smart\ncontracts. They provide an agreement or a consensus between\
    \ the two parties involved.\nUsers cannot alter or delete a smart contract once\
    \ it is published on the blockchain network.\nNo central authority involvement\
    \ is needed for validation of tasks. The results computed by\nthe nodes in the\
    \ network do not have any interference from outside the network. Banking,\nsupply\
    \ chain, IoT and insurance industries are deploying permissioned smart contracts.\n\
    In [110], Rathee et al. proposed a framework for connected and autonomous vehicles\n\
    (CAV), in which smart contracts with blockchain are implemented for security assurance\
    \ of\nElectronics 2021, 10, 1732\n13 of 26\nvehicles. Veriﬁcation of registration\
    \ providers and tracking or alteration of user data can be\nhandled through it.\n\
    Through smart contracts, mobility services and smart transportation are implemented\n\
    and deﬁned by IPFS in [111], in which DLTs (Distributed Ledger Technologies)-based\n\
    infrastructure with distributed data management technologies have been used for\
    \ data\nsharing and providing smart services. In [112], Ethereum smart contract\
    \ and IOTA-based\narchitecture for authenticity has been proposed by Zichichi\
    \ et al., in which the entities’ co-\nordination, access authorization, and privacy\
    \ of users have been achieved. Zero knowledge\nproof for privacy offering and\
    \ the guarantee for proof of location has been used.\nA system CHORUS mobility\
    \ in [113], whereas, in [114], a decentralized system has\nbeen presented for\
    \ smart transportation system with the combination of VANETs and\nEthereum for\
    \ rules enforcement.\n3.4. Consensus\nAn important part and key contribution of\
    \ blockchain is its consensus mechanisms.\nConsensus mechanisms are used to make\
    \ agreement between different parties in a dis-\ntributed environment to append\
    \ blocks in the blockchain. There are two main types of\nconsensus mechanisms;\
    \ proof-based consensus and voting-based consensus. Proof-based\nconsensus involves\
    \ adding blocks by the qualiﬁed individuals and voting-based mecha-\nnism involves\
    \ sharing the results of transaction in order to make the ﬁnal decision. A very\n\
    important and basic part of bitcoin is POW (Proof of Work) [4], which involves\
    \ intensive\nmathematical computations. In terms of resource and energy consumption,\
    \ POW is very\nexpensive. Given the heaviness and cost of the task, PoW still\
    \ seems the best solution\nbecause it prevents spamming and DoS attacks.\nPOW\
    \ is hard to be performed but it is easy to be veriﬁed once performed. In case\
    \ of\nbitcoin, this task is performed by the miners and veriﬁable by everyone\
    \ in the network who\nis a part of blockchain peer-to-peer network. Miners are\
    \ given incentives because the task\nthey perform successfully is fundamentally\
    \ very expensive. A new block in blockchain can\nonly be added after solving an\
    \ expensive mathematical task.\n3.4.1. Proof-Based Consensus\nThere are following\
    \ proof-based consensus algorithms.\n•\nProof of Work (POW) Consensus: First use\
    \ of PoW consensus started with Bitcoin\nand became popular after it. It was originally\
    \ used to verify the transactions and for\nmining purpose. When a miner mines\
    \ a transaction, he has to solve a mathematical\npuzzle. The puzzle involves looking\
    \ for a value that when hashed generates a speciﬁc\nvalue. This puzzle is fundamentally\
    \ computationally expensive. A new block cannot\nbe added to the blockchain without\
    \ successfully mining it. Once a miner ﬁnds a\nsolution to the puzzle, it is broadcasted\
    \ in the network and can be veriﬁed by any\nor all of the peers. Validation is\
    \ a cheap task in terms of computational resources it\nconsumes, as it only involves\
    \ hashing a value, and hence can be done by anyone in\nthe network. As it takes\
    \ lots of computing resources to solve this puzzle, the miners\nare given an intentive.\
    \ After Bitcoin, PoW has been implemented in other several\ncryptocurrencies,\
    \ namely Litecoin, Dash and Monero.\n•\nProof of Stake (PoS) Consensus: In PoW,\
    \ multiple miners are attempting to solve the\nmathematical puzzle at the same\
    \ time. The ﬁrst successful miner is given an incentive\nfor adding a block in\
    \ the blockchain, but for other miners, this process was a waste\nof computing\
    \ resources. This limitation of PoW is covered by PoS. In PoS, miners\nare in\
    \ no competition with each other. The validator receives a transaction fee for\n\
    addition of a new block. In this way, the total amount of currency always remains\n\
    the same in the network. Also, the validator is elected beforehand in PoS, unlike\n\
    PoW, where anyone with enough computational resources in the nwtwork can mine.\n\
    No one except this elected validator can add a new block. Anyone who wants to\n\
    be elected has to put a part of his currency at stake. The amount of currency\
    \ put\nElectronics 2021, 10, 1732\n14 of 26\nat stack is directly proportional\
    \ to the chances of being elected as a validator. After\nthe successful validation,\
    \ the validator receives the staked currency as well as the\ntransaction fees,\
    \ and the other candidates get their staked amount back. PoS is used\nby Nxt.\n\
    •\nHybrid PoW and PoS: A comparison between PoS and PoW is given in Table 5. It\n\
    shows properties of both the consensus mechanisms and hybrid consensus mechanism.\n\
    However, some schemes use a hybrid of both PoS and PoW consensus mechanisms.\n\
    The key advantage of using this hybrid is getting the advantages from both of\
    \ these\nschemes and using one scheme to overcome the limitation of the other\
    \ one. A hybrid\nconsensus mechanism has been used by Decred cryptocurrency.\n\

    \ include the following.\n•\nProof of Capacity (PoC) Consensus: Started with Burstcoin,\
    \ the PoC mechanism\ndecreases the usage of computational resources and uses storage\
    \ resources. Before\nmining is started, miners store the set of possible solutions\
    \ of the puzzle. The miner\nwho has more storage tends to store more solutions.\
    \ Thus, the miners with more\nstorage space have higher chances of mining.\n•\n\
    Proof of Burn (PoB) Consensus: A concept named “eater address” is used in PoB.\n\
    Before starting mining, the miners send coins to an invalid address randomly.\
    \ Blocks\nare created and these addresses are changes. The coins sent to these\
    \ addresses are not\nusable anymore because of the fact that these addresses are\
    \ invalid and unknown. The\nprocess is repeated until there is only one miner\
    \ left that has some more coins to invest.\nThis miner receives the mining coins\
    \ and the transaction fees as a reward. Miners that\nhave been investing in creation\
    \ of blocks in the past are given more privileges. PoB is\nused by Slimcoin.\n\
    •\nProof of Importance (PoI) Consensus: PoI is a score-based protocol that was\
    \ ﬁrst used\nwith NEM cryptocurrency. The individual who invests more coins in\
    \ the network\nmakes the higher score. This score is affected by the number of\
    \ transactions and the\nsize of transactions. The lower limit for investing coins\
    \ in 10,000 coins. The user with\nhighest score has the highest chance of being\
    \ a validator.\n4. Integration of Blockchain and IoT\nMany researches integrate\
    \ blockchain in IoT to enhance security and provide an\nefﬁcient data storage\
    \ system. In [56], authors review the recent literature on blockchain’s\nintegration\
    \ with IoT. It is pointed out that blockchain helps to improve security and\n\
    scalability in IoT scenarios. In [62], authors highlight some attacks that IoT\
    \ systems are\nprone to, and review the researches that use blockchain to mitigate\
    \ privacy-related issues\nin IoT.\nThis section explains why blockchain is useful\
    \ in an IoT environment.\nElectronics 2021, 10, 1732\n15 of 26\n4.1. Opportunities\

    \ use cloud computing in order\nto keep the data synchronized. This data, if compromised,\
    \ can result in loss of security and\nprivacy of a user. Blockchain can be used\
    \ to securely use and transmit this data across the\nnetwork. Also, blockchain\
    \ makes the records immutable, so no records can be modiﬁed by\na malicious user,\
    \ speciﬁcally healthcare records that need to be kept secure.\n4.1.2. Decentralization\n\
    As IoT devices are distributed, blockchain provides an efﬁcient and convenient\
    \ solu-\ntion for decentralization. Data can be maintained in the blockchain and\
    \ published without\nthe fear of potential modiﬁcations to be made by a malicious\
    \ third party. As seen in bitcoin,\nblockchain provides decentralization solution\
    \ in P2P networks [4]. The data are distributed\nusing blockchain among other\
    \ IoT devices in a decentralized fashion. In this way, the use\nof blockchain\
    \ also eradicates the need of a central entity, such as a cloud server. Another\
    \ ad-\nvantage that comes from this property of blockchain is removal of a single-point-of-failure,\n\
    because when a central entity is involved, it becomes a target of malicious users.\n\
    4.1.3. Encryption\nBlockchain stores hashes of the data in the ledger, which makes\
    \ it light-weighted, as\nhash functions generate a small and ﬁxed size of output\
    \ for any size of input. The actual\ndata are usually stored on a cloud server\
    \ and hashes are kept in the blockchain. Blockchain\nusually utilizes SHA-256\
    \ algorithm for hashing. Symmetric encryption in blockchain\nprovides user and\
    \ transaction security, prevents double-spending problem and veriﬁcation\nof digital\
    \ asset transfer. Because of secure encryption mechanisms that blockchain provides,\n\
    authors of [58] point out that it can be used to guarantee privacy preservation\
    \ in IoT and\nIIoT. It is concluded that blockchain can help to pave better and\
    \ more efﬁcient ways for\nbusinesses in IoT industry, such as mobile commerce,\
    \ food logistics management, electric\nvehicles, etc.\n4.1.4. Access Control\n\
    Traditional access control systems are shifting toward blockchain in IoT-based\
    \ en-\nvironments. Blockchain provides attribute-based and ﬁne-grained encryption,\
    \ granular\nattribute-based, and role-based access control solutions [36] for\
    \ IoT.\nZhao et al. [115] proposed a message encryption scheme using symmetric\
    \ key en-\ncryption. In this scheme, the data owner uses attribute-based encryption\
    \ to encrypt a\nmessage with default attributes and sends the ciphertext to the\
    \ encryption proxy server.\nXu et al. [116] utilize smart contracts with capability-based\
    \ solutions that achieve high\nscalability and interoperability while focusing\
    \ on delegation. However, authorization\nmodel is not provided in the paper.\n\
    A blockchain-based architecture for IoT privacy preservation is proposed by Rahula-\n\
    mathavan et al. [117], in which an attribute-based encryption has been used with\
    \ Testbed\nplatform to achieve data privacy and conﬁdentiality, but there is a\
    \ slight time increase due\nto involvement of multiple attribute authorities and\
    \ using PoW consensus mechanism.\n4.2. Applications of Blockchain in IoT\nThis\
    \ section describes the uses of blockchain in different IoT scenarios.\nElectronics\
    \ 2021, 10, 1732\n16 of 26\n4.2.1. Healthcare System\nDifferent sensors have been\
    \ introduced to detect and upload patient’s information\non cloud in emergency\
    \ situations from a remote location. These sensors/devices can\nautomatically\
    \ communicate with the medical personnel upon detecting a certain threshold.\n\
    Using IoT, patients can be checked up from remote locations through these sensors\
    \ and it is\noften possible. In addition to checkup, it is also used to treat\
    \ the patients. This can, in many\ncases, help save a life and provide medical\
    \ help to patients in emergency situations in\ntime. Blockchain comes with many\
    \ beneﬁts that could be helpful for IoT when it comes to\nhealthcare systems.\
    \ It can protect the privacy and security of critical data stored in eHealth\n\
    systems. When needed, it can also allow to use the data without modifying it.\n\
    4.2.2. Software Deﬁned Network\nSoftware deﬁned networking technology has been\
    \ proposed for increasing bandwidth\nof IoT devices. The processing of decision\
    \ making is simpliﬁed and intelligent routing\nis provided. An example is DiskBlockNet;\
    \ an IoT network architecture with distributed\nnetwork that provides ﬂexibility\
    \ and scalability without central controlling server. In this\ndistributed network\
    \ of blockchain, two kinds of nodes are present, veriﬁcation node for\nmaintaining\
    \ the information ﬂow of tables and responding node to update table ﬂow rules.\n\
    4.2.3. Crowdsensing Applications\nCrowdsensing is a novel kind of mobile IoT,\
    \ like geo sensing. On blockchain cryp-\ntocurrencies, privacy preservation incentive\
    \ mechanism was developed by Wang et al. [70].\nWhich eliminates privacy and security\
    \ issues like impersonation attacks, with the help of\ntransparent blockchain\
    \ and data veriﬁcation by the miners.\n4.2.4. Energy Systems\nFuture of energy\
    \ systems is known as smart grids which are the replacement of\ntraditional energy\
    \ systems due to the involvement of ICT (Information and Communication\nTechnology).\
    \ Because of various advantages like cost effectiveness, uninterrupted power\n\
    supply and two-way communication, smart grid is considered as the next generation\
    \ of\nenergy systems [118].\n4.2.5. Internet of Vehicles\nEstablishment of smart\
    \ communication between heterogeneous networks and vehicles\n(V) like V to Road,\
    \ V to V, V to Infrastructure, V to Sensor, V to Everything and V to Human\nare\
    \ some emerging technologies in IoT. Many authors proposed various decentralized\n\
    security models like LNSC, for managing charging pile and electric vehicle [119]\
    \ by using\nECC and hash functions.\n4.3. Blockchain-Based IoT Privacy Preserving\
    \ Schemes\nAs IoT consists of billions of devices accross the world, it poses\
    \ serious threats to the\nprivacy of the users. Other than providing decentralization,\
    \ consensus and smart contracts\nfor IoT, blockchain is being used at a large\
    \ scale to assure privacy preservation in IoT.\nTable 6 presents a summary of\

    Recently, many schemes have been proposed for blockchain-based privacy preserva-\n\
    tion in IoT. For electric vehicles, a blockchain-based privacy preserving charging\
    \ system has\nbeen proposed in [125]. In this scheme, for every session, a new\
    \ pair of keys are generated\nby the system. Other than that, for providing anonymity\
    \ protection in blockchain, the\ntechniques like ring signatures, non-interactive\
    \ zero knowledge and mixing services are\nfrequently used.\nSome limitations of\
    \ anonymization include high computation cost, de-anonymization\nand loss of meaningful\
    \ information through generalization and suppression.\nElectronics 2021, 10, 1732\n\
    18 of 26\n4.3.2. Ring Signatures\nTo improv privacy in blockchain signiﬁcantly,\
    \ a set of choices need to be made without\nthe need of a central manager. For\
    \ generation of anonymous signatures from possible\nsigners group, without identity\
    \ disclosure, a scheme is proposed by fujisaki et al. in [126].\nLinkability and\
    \ anonymity are properties that are achieved through ring signatures-based\nprivacy\
    \ preserving mechanisms [127–129].\nIn [127], Saberhagen et al. proposed CrptoNote.\
    \ In this scheme, with single private\nkey, the user can sign one valid transaction.\
    \ It is a modiﬁcation of ring signatures, which\nmitigates the attacks like double\
    \ spending by replacing tags with image of key comput-\ning. The signer identity\
    \ can only be disclosed when he uses the same pair of keys for\nsecond signature.\n\
    RingCT is an improvement of CryptoNote, which provides transactional privacy\n\
    as well as identity privacy by Noether et al [128]. Ring signatures with Greg\
    \ Maxwell’s\nConﬁdential Transaction [130]a are used for hiding the amount whereas\
    \ the amount is\nplaced at MLSAG (Multilayer Linkable Spontaneous Anonymous Group\
    \ Signature) [131].\nMonero is a strong implementation of this approach [129].\
    \ In [132], heavily centralized\nintermediaries were used but they are also vulnerable\
    \ to security attacks. In Creditcoin [57],\nanonymized ring signatures announcements\
    \ have been proposed in which user’s privacy\ncan achieved. In this work, an incentive-based\
    \ network has also been created.\nLimitation of ring signatures include the following:\n\
    •\nLarge size of transactions increases the storage space of blockchain records.\n\
    •\nSize of ring signature is directly proportional to the number of participants,\
    \ that is\nwhy only limited number of outputs are generated.\n•\nAuditing difﬁculty\
    \ is also faced due to hidden amount.\n4.3.3. Non Interactive Zero Knowledge\n\
    It is an alternative approach of zero knowledge proof. Message veriﬁcation can\
    \ be\ndone in an anonymous way because of not having an interaction between veriﬁer\
    \ and\nprover. A scheme was proposed by Blum et al. [133], in which, the correctness\
    \ of assertion\ncan be proven without leaking any information.\nZeroCash [134]\
    \ and ZeroCoin [135] are two blockchain-based anonymization schemes\nin which\
    \ ZKP concept has been used for the prevention of transactional data leakage.\n\
    At high computational cost, Zerocash achieves the highest level of anonymization.\
    \ In\ncontrast, Hawk [136] is the ﬁrst work to provide programmability and transactional\
    \ privacy\nin blockchain.\nLimitations of non interactive zero knowledge include\
    \ high computational cost of trans-\nactions proof, fixed coin dominations in\
    \ zerocoin and unprotected public transaction lists.\n4.3.4. Mixing\nFor mitigation\
    \ of analytical attack, which is used for accessing the sender or receiver\ntransaction’s\
    \ privacy information, in a blockchain system, mixing approach has been used,\n\
    which is also known as laundry or tumbler. Chaum [137] presented the service,\
    \ in which\ncommunication content as well as sender and receiver information can\
    \ be hidden.\nCurrently, to reduce de-anonymization risk and obfuscation of transaction\
    \ history, the\nresearchers are focusing on centralized and decentralized mixing\
    \ strategies. Many mixing\nwebsites like onion bc, bitcoin fog, bitmixer, helix\
    \ by grams, bit laundry, send shared and\nbitblender are available. By providing\
    \ some fees they can provide anonymous mixing\ntransaction service. Some services\
    \ are only provided through TOR network, on which, free\nworldwide anonymous communication\
    \ has been enabled.\nBy not transferring data to the receiver, the attacker steals\
    \ the user asset [138]. Disclo-\nsure of personnel data is not ensured by the\
    \ system because, in transactions, routing the\nservice provider keeps the user\
    \ log. Conditional execution is the ﬁrst solution, in which the\nmixer only gets\
    \ reward when it correctly operates, otherwise it does not get any rewards\nfrom\
    \ the user. CoinSwap is a bitcoin mixing protocol introduced by Gregory et al.\
    \ [130],\nElectronics 2021, 10, 1732\n19 of 26\nin which transactions are done\
    \ in escrow mechanism structure with hash lock protec-\ntion. An accountable mechanism\
    \ based on signatures, Mixcoin has been proposed by\nBonneau et al. [139] that\
    \ exposes the misbehaving mixer by unambiguous proof made by\nthe users.\nAnother\
    \ solution is Blind signature scheme, in which a message is blinded by the\nsystem\
    \ before the signing of the message. Blinding, signing and unblinding are three\n\
    steps. It is publicly veriﬁable, whereas the origin and connection is hidden from\
    \ the signer.\nBlindcoin [140] is a combination of append-only public log with\
    \ blind signature scheme\nfor accountability of mixing process. For mixing fairness\
    \ and providing anonymity, smart\ncontracts with blind signatures are applied\
    \ by Hielman et al. in [141].\nDash [142] made the ﬁrst anonymity attempt in digital\
    \ currency environment which\nwas released in 2014. Removal of a user’s unique\
    \ information on blockchain is done in\nthis project, called PrivateSend. To avoid\
    \ coin theft and achieve complete unlinkability,\nTumbleBit [143] was proposed.\
    \ A strategy for ﬁnancial transactions decentralization,\nCoinShufﬂe by Rufﬁng\
    \ et al. [144] was introduced. Through decentralized blockchain\nbehavior mixing\
    \ with third party, removal has been ensured.\nMixing Limitations include the\
    \ following:\n•\nFor fair exchange of transactions, the executional process or\
    \ online participants waiting\ncreates a huge delay.\n•\nA single point of failure\
    \ exists due to centralized nature of the server. This makes the\nserver vulnerable\
    \ to DoS attacks.\n•\nHigh mixing fees are a problem for users in fair exchange\
    \ of transactions. Due to\nlow anonymity level, mixing protocol can easily be\
    \ compromised through Sybil\nattacks [145].\n•\nThe leakage of transaction privacy\
    \ through backtracking analysis of transactional\ngraph is a serious issue.\n\
    4.3.5. Differential Privacy\nTo achieve the data conﬁdentiality without leakage\
    \ risks through privacy preserva-\ntion, a technique has been proposed known as\
    \ differential privacy by C Dwork, who\nmade a database protection mechanism which\
    \ adds noise at each query evaluation [146].\nFor protection of health care systems,\
    \ data perturbation mechanism has been used by\nDagher et al. in [147]. In [148],\
    \ a scheme is presented to protect a smart home resident’s\nprivacy through multiple\
    \ pseudonym techniques. Trafﬁc encryption has been done for\nproviding data authenticity,\
    \ access control and conﬁdentiality.\nDifferential privacy limitations include:\n\
    •\nDifferential privacy provides privacy-utility trade-off. Precision in Data\
    \ and loss\nof certainty are the results of increasing noise addition for enhancing\
    \ the privacy\nlevel [149].\n•\nIt is prone to timing analysis attack in trafﬁc\
    \ ﬂow obfuscation mechanisms [150].\n5. Conclusions\nDespite of all the opportunities\
    \ that IoT brings, it suffers from issues like hetero-\ngeneity of IoT devices,\
    \ resource constraints, and poor interoperability between these\ndevices. Other\
    \ important challenges in IoT include privacy, availability, conﬁdentiality\n\
    and integrity. Blockchain comes with opportunities like immutability, decentralization,\n\
    transparency, integrity, consensus, conﬁdentiality, non-repudiation, privacy and\
    \ security in\na distributed network. When blockchain is implemented in IoT, it\
    \ provides solutions to the\nproblems faced.\nThe aim of this paper has been to\
    \ provide a comprehensive survey of the problems\nfaced by IoT and the solutions\
    \ provided by the blockchain technology. We ﬁrst discussed\nblockchain and IoT\
    \ separately. We looked at the applications, advantages and limitations\nof both\
    \ of these technologies. We then analyzed the impact that blockchain has on IoT.\
    \ We\ndiscussed how IoT is beneﬁted by blockchain, based on the opportunities\
    \ and strengths of\nElectronics 2021, 10, 1732\n20 of 26\nblockchain. We reviewed\
    \ researches based on the implementation of blockchain in IoT in\nresource constrained\
    \ environments. It is highlighted that the use of blockchain is increasing\nin\
    \ IoT and providing the solutions that it needs, from healthcare to smart homes\
    \ to military.\nIoT uses a large number of devices and most of these devices are\
    \ resource-constrained.\nBlockchain being light-weighted is a great solution for\
    \ privacy preservation in resource-\nconstrained devices. The privacy aspect of\
    \ blockchain comes from its ability to provide\ntransparency in a distributed\
    \ network. We have seen that the use of blockchain, other than\nproviding immutability,\
    \ decentralization, and consensus, it helps preserving user’s privacy\nin IoT\
    \ environment.\n6. Future Research Directions and Challenges\nPrivacy preservation\
    \ is important because users’ data is collected by almost all IoT\ndevices. We\
    \ present some future research directions in terms of privacy preservation.\n\
    6.1. IOTA Ledger\nIn order to provide security and privacy, integration of the\
    \ Tangle in IoT can be very\nuseful. Tangle is a data structure that IOTA is based\
    \ on. It utilizes a directed acyclic graph\nand utilizes less energy as compared\
    \ to a blockchain network. IOTA is light-weighted and\nquantum resistant. Another\
    \ important advantage is that IOTA does not need miners. The\nnetwork participants\
    \ issue new transactions without having to involve another node that\nhas better\
    \ computing resources. Having no miners makes IOTA fee-less.\n6.2. Strong Privacy\
    \ Preservation Mechanisms\nStrong privacy preservation is still a challenge when\
    \ using blockchain. For example,\nin order to resist Sybil attack, a certain amount\
    \ of honest participants are required in\ndecentralized mixing protocol. Hawk\
    \ reinitializes and creates a different trusted process\nfor every smart contract,\
    \ so privacy preservation having few trust assumptions needs to\nbe enhanced.\n\
    6.3. Security Framework\nA single security solution for all blockchain-based IoT\
    \ devices cannot fulﬁll security\nrequirement due to resources-constrained nature\
    \ of devices. The designs of such kinds of\nframeworks are required to provide\
    \ dynamic and adaptable security. Implementation of\nother privacy preserving\
    \ solutions, such as data anonymization and differential privacy\nalong with blockchain,\
    \ can provide better privacy. A framework is needed that can preserve\nprivacy\
    \ using both the techniques, keeping resource-constrained nature of IoT devices\n\
    in mind.\n6.4. Blockchain-Based Infrastructure\nThe storage in decentralized large-sized\
    \ blockchain is also an issue, as we have seen\nthat IoT devices are storing data\
    \ continuously whether it is useful or not which increases\nthe blockchain data\
    \ and makes it heavy. Since all nodes in the blockchain network are\nrequired\
    \ to keep a local copy of the ledger, it becomes infeasible for light-weighted\
    \ devices\nto store a copy of the ledger. A framework is required that reduces\
    \ the storage overhead on\nsmall IoT devices caused by blockchain maintenance.\n\

    Metrics Abstract: Due to the proliferation of ICT during the last few decades,
    there is an exponential increase in the usage of various smart applications such
    as smart farming, smart healthcare, supply-chain & logistics, business, tourism
    and hospitality, energy management etc. However, for all the aforementioned applications,
    security and privacy are major concerns keeping in view of the usage of the open
    channel, i.e., Internet for data transfer. Although many security solutions and
    standards have been proposed over the years to enhance the security levels of
    aforementioned smart applications, but the existing solutions are either based
    upon the centralized architecture (having single point of failure) or having high
    computation and communication costs. Moreover, most of the existing security solutions
    have focussed only on few aspects and fail to address scalability, robustness,
    data storage, network latency, auditability, immutability, and traceability. To
    handle the aforementioned issues, blockchain technology can be one of the solutions.
    Motivated from these facts, in this paper, we present a systematic review of various
    blockchain-based solutions and their applicability in various Industry 4.0-based
    applications. Our contributions in this paper are in four fold. Firstly, we explored
    the current state-of-the-art solutions in the blockchain technology for the smart
    applications. Then, we illustrated the reference architecture used for the blockchain
    applicability in various Industry 4.0 applications. Then, merits and demerits
    of the traditional security solutions are also discussed in comparison to their
    countermeasures. Finally, we provided a comparison of existing blockchain-based
    security solutions using various parameters to provide deep insights to the readers
    about its applicability in various applications. Topic: Deep Learning Algorithms

    With the wide popularity of Internet and related technologies, various Industry
    4.0-based applications have been used across the globe in which sensors and actuators
    sense, compute and communicate the data for industry automation. As in Industry
    4.0-based applications, data between different locations flows using an open channel,
    i.e., Internet, so threats to security and privacy has also increased manyfold
    [1]. Such applications deal with data in large volumes and hence, so it is necessary
    to consider issues such as-data heterogeneity, data integrity, and data redundancy
    alongwith the security and privacy concerns. Moreover, different applications
    require datasets from different domains in different formats. Therefore, it is
    also needed to standardize the data format so that it can be used by different
    Industry 4.0-based applications. The usage of smart phones and smart applications
    for personal, professional, and social activities is increasing exponentially
    across the globe. It results an increase in both the network data traffic (in
    GBs) and overall expenditure (in Billions USD) as shown in Fig. 1 (a) and (b)
    as per the report mentioned in [2], [3]. According to this report, smart industries
    would spend $40B on IoT by 2020 in various sectors including transportation and
    manufacturing. However, due to the large number of data exchanges over the Internet,
    maintaining confidentiality, privacy, and integrity becomes a major issue in Industry
    4.0 [4]. Moreover, according to the surveys conducted by different agencies [5],
    [6] nearly 60 millions people are affected by identity theft and 12 billion peoples
    records misused in 2018 and expected to increase to 33 billion by 2023 as shown
    in Fig. 2 (a). Fig. 2(b) shows the 10 recent security breaches incidents reported
    till July 2018, which are expected to increase in the years to come. FIGURE 1.
    Statistics of (a) Data traffic per month region wise and (b) Application-wise
    expenditure on Industry 4.0. Show All FIGURE 2. (a) Increase in identity theft
    and (b) Generation of data traffic. Show All Security and privacy preservation
    are important concerns for Industry 4.0 applications [4], [7]. There may be chances
    of unauthorized data breaching or information leakage leading to the financial
    losses to Industry 4.0-based applications. In the absence of robust security architecture,
    the system along with data are prone to various types of attacks (such as DDoS,
    ARP spoofing attacks, data rate alteration, network congestion, manipulation,
    noise interference, phishing and config threats) which can harm the confidentiality
    and integrity of data and can affect the overall functioning of any system. For
    such types of attacks, prevention is better than any reactive defense mechanisms
    to assure confidentiality, integrity, and privacy within the legal compliance
    rules [8]. It has been found in the literature that with an increasing rate of
    automation in Industry 4.0., the probability of violating the security rules and
    launching new type of cyber-attacks is also increasing. Access control, authorization,
    confidentiality, availability, and integrity are the prime concerns in Industry
    4.0. To mitigate the aforementioned threats, current Industry solutions are using
    the centralized, client-server based architecture in which the centralized authority
    holds all the privileges. But, if the centralized authority is compromised then
    the entire system may crash. Conventional security mechanisms such as Data Encryption
    Standard (DES), and Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and their variants are
    also being used but they have high computation and communication overhead. However,
    a revolution in this area came with the introduction of the concept of “Bitcoins”
    [9]. For example, Authors of [10] illustrated that how blockchain technology can
    be used to deal with privacy & security issues in Industry 4.0 [11]. The blockchain
    technology has the potential to handle various security attacks as it can eliminate
    the need of the centralized authority to perform various operations. In the blockchain
    technology, a number of users participate in transaction verification and validation
    [12]–[17]. It uses a structural distributed database which stores data from all
    the nodes in an encrypted form validated using various checks such as Merkle hash
    tree (MHT) and Elliptical Curve Cryptography (ECC) [17]. As the database is distributed,
    so there is a risk of getting crashed or corrupted. Transactions are linked together
    with cryptographic keys and immutable ledgers which makes it difficult for attackers
    to manipulate or delete the recorded information. Data is always stored in an
    immutable manner using timestamps, public audit and consensus mechanisms [18],
    [19]. The use of these mechanisms makes security architecture a robust and assures
    data integrity and privacy [20]. A. Scope of This Survey Article The blockchain
    reduces the risk of single point of failure and network attacks using the distributed
    network nodes. Use of the decentralized platform reduces fraud by time stamping
    entries, and information of users is stored in immutable ledger across the network
    using the smart contact. Blockchain eliminates manual processes like reconciliation
    between multiple isolated ledger and administrative processes which helps to reduce
    the cost of the system. Due to the use of various cryptographic linked chains,
    the speed of transaction and level of security is enhanced manyfold. Several surveys
    are conducted by the researchers using the blockchain technology for Industry
    4.0 which are summarized as follows [21]. Mettler [22] explored how blockchain
    technology revolutionized the healthcare alongwith various open challenges [23],
    [24]. Yli-Huumo et al. [25] reviewed the current scenario of the blockchain technology
    and its research gaps and challenges. They have also discussed the suitability
    of the blockchain for various smart applications. Ahram et al. [26] discussed
    the various components in blockchains such as decentralized techniques and immutability
    of ledger that makes it difficult to attack the system [27]. Weiss et al. [28]
    discussed about blockchain public healthcare applications. They have also explored
    how the blockchain technology eliminates the centralized authority during the
    verification process, its digital signatures [29] for safe data repository, its
    architecture, and also the challenges. Zhang et al. [30] evaluated the metrics
    of blockchain-based decentralized applications. In this paper, they considered
    the evolution metrics, security, and challenges which are important for various
    applications like healthcare, smart-agriculture, IoT, and tourism & hospitality.
    Krieger et al. [31] explored an advanced blockchain architecture for the electronic
    health systems. They focused on the regulatory compliance for the data privacy
    of blockchain, its architecture, limitations, and benefits [32]. Duan et al. [33]
    explored educational applications of the blockchain technology. In this paper,
    an automated evaluation software as a tool with blocks is proposed, which contains
    graduation marks along with the certificate. They also highlighted how blocks
    are recorded, Merkle hash tree, hash functions, digital signatures, and timestamp
    mechanisms during the verification of various transactions. Radanović and Likić
    et al. [34] explored the opportunity of applying blockchain technology in the
    medical domain. Authors focused on the areas such as supply-chain of drugs, pharmaceuticals,
    and health insurance with associated challenges. They also discussed how the blockchain
    can be used in countries like USA and India for the land registration. Vujičić
    et al. [35] gave an overview of blockchain bitcoin and Etheruem cryptocurrency
    platforms. In this paper, the authors explained the architecture, security parameters,

    Background and History of Blockchain A. Traditional Security System and Blockchain
    In the present era, most of the database systems use a centralized client-server
    based architecture. In this systems, a client (user) has the authority to modify
    the data stored in the centralized server. The control of the entire server database
    is with the centralized authority who can control and take decisions with respect
    to various access control policies defined on the data stored in the database.
    They also have the authority to authenticate users credentials before they access
    the database. To resolve the issues in the traditional centralized systems, blockchain
    can be an effective solution. A blockchain is a chain of blocks which can be used
    to store and share data in a distributed, transparent and tamper resistant manner.
    Each block consists of data and is linked with other blocks using pointers. Such
    linkages ensure the integrity and tamper resistance in the blockchain. When a
    new data is added to the blockchain, link to the free end is created which extends
    the blockchain by one block or unit. As more data is added to the blockchain,
    it gets longer and chain grwos in size. If one of the blocks is modified in the
    chain, it breaks cryptographic links which disrupts the whole blockchain. It also
    allows the user to verify the integrity of the stored data. The risk of the centralized
    control system can be eliminated with an implementation of decentralized systems.
    The database authority holds the centralized control on the security needed for
    all the users for the required access. The blockchain stores the data and builds
    the structural data storage which makes the network more secure. Due to this,
    the blockchain technology makes easy records or transactions with heterogeneous
    information in the databases. B. Background of Blockchain The idea of blocks connection
    by cryptographic chains was introduced by Stuart Haber and Scott Stornetta in
    1991. They designed a system, in which information or transaction stored with
    timestamps can not be modified or tampered. After that Bayer, Haber, and Stornetta
    proposed verification and validation of various transactions using the Merkle
    tree. In the Merkle tree, recorded data was gathered into a single block with
    an improved quality. Satoshi Nakamoto created the initial blockchain network in
    2008 [9]. He introduced the hash function method to create blocks in the chain.
    The major attempt was to improve the architecture and development of the blockchain
    in which there was no need of sign by the clients or the users. This implementation
    build the network for cryptocurrency recognized as bitcoin. The bitcoin network
    is publicly available ledger for all the transaction records. In his research
    work, blocks and chain were separate words which are combined together known as
    blockchain. They got the bitcoin network file size and the records of its transactions
    reached up to 20 GB by 2014, which went to 30 GB between the last quarter of 2014
    to 2015. The bitcoin network was pushed from 50GB to 100 GB in January 2017. The
    blockchain is used in the finance or cryptocurrency applications as it enhances
    the quality of various applications with respect to speed, security ease of use,
    and confidentiality. To explore the possibilities of applying blockchain technology
    in various industries, many companies have established their research centers
    for growth of this technology. For example, IBM has its research center in Singapore
    which was inaugurated in July 2016. In November 2016, the group of world economic
    forum discussed the development of the governance models for the blockchain technology.
    The global blockchain forum introduced the chamber of digital commerce in 2016
    by Accenture’s trade group. Emma Macclarkin suggested the use of blockchain to
    enhance the trade which was executed by the European parliament’s trade in 2018.
    How blockchain revolutionized: The revolution of blockchain technology from inception
    to till today is explained in detail as shown in Fig 4. FIGURE 4. Generations
    of Blockchain. Show All 1) Blockchain 1.0 The first generation of the technology
    was started with the bitcoin network in 2009, which is known as blockchain 1.0.
    In this generation, the creation of the first cryptocurrencies was introduced.
    The idea was all about payment and its functionalities to generate cryptocurrency.
    2) Blockchain 2.0 In the second level of the blockchain technology, smart contract
    and financial services for various applications were introduced in 2010. The development
    of blockchain with Etheruem and Hyperledger frameworks was proposed in this generation.
    3) Blockchain 3.0 In this generation of blockchains, the convergence towards the
    decentralized applications was introduced. Various research areas such as health,
    governance, IoT, supply-chain, business, and smart city were considered for building
    decentralized applications [46]. In this level, etheruem, hyperledger, and other
    platforms were used which having the ability to code smart contracts for a variety
    of decentralized applications [47], [48]. 4) Blockchain 4.0 This generation mainly
    focused on services such as public ledger and distributed databases in real-time.
    This level has seamless integration of Industry 4.0-based applications. It uses
    the smart contract which eliminates the need for paper-based contracts and regulates
    within the network by its consensus [49]. Blockchain Requirements: Smart Contracts:
    It is a protocol which allows the performance of transactions in absence of third
    party that makes transactions irreversible and traceable. Tokenization: It is
    one of the most important things that must to be included in the blockchain. It
    facilitates digital representation of the goods, services, and rights with the
    help of tokens. It allows the exchange of values and trust for different users
    without involving the central authority. Data security: Security compliance is
    a major and essential requirement of blockchain technology with a legal point
    of view. Decentralised data storage: It is a basic requirement of the distributed
    system. Immutability: All the records on the network should not be modified or
    tampered in the shared ledger. This enables the integrity of the stored data.
    Consensus: Transactions should only be updated when all the verified users in
    the network agree for the same. Typed Blocks: It is required for the smart contract
    and for high speed payment in business transactions. So, data formatting of the
    different types of blocks include its time, consensus algorithm [50], number of
    transaction per blocks, and its content data types. Sharding: It is required for
    the separation of content over subsets of nodes in a way, that not all the nodes
    need to carry all processing load or any burden. Access rights management: Encryption
    based private and public key cryptography and distributed databases with user
    identification is required to assign and manage access rights. Standards used
    to manage permissioned blockchains: Immutability of the blockchain network makes
    the data access in a specific order. The public certificates are available in
    public blockchain, but without having the private key, authorization cannot be
    provided to the users. So, all the data should be managed in order of data elements
    like user’s internet protocol (IP) address, name, its code, and extensible markup
    language. These all are published to the consortium with the communication process.
    Standard data formatting: In the blockchain system, it is also needed to standardize
    the data formats with respect to Application Programming Interfaces (API). Each
    organization in the blockchain network needs to use the same data format or APIs
    to communicate in the same network. Updatability: The need for data updation in
    the distributed ledger is most important for records. In a peer-to-peer network,
    data needs to be structured and systematically updated for each node that transacts
    within the network. P2P encryption between blockchain nodes: Encryption is needed
    to secure the transactions between the end nodes that may link together in the
    blockchain protocol. UX: One of the major factors in a system is the user interface
    design that provides an easy and convenient application environment to the users.
    The main difference between the blockchain-based and non-blockchain-based systems
    is the manner in which the user perceives it. Development operation: The main
    step in the production of the system is the selection of platforms that requires
    less time and the setup complexity. SECTION III. Blockchain Architecture and its
    Components A. Basic Blockchain Based Architecture In the basic architecture of
    the blockchain, each transaction needs to be verified which can not be altered
    as shown in Fig. 5. FIGURE 5. The basic blockchain-based architecture. Show All
    1) Addition of Transactions in the Block Structure A blockchain transaction has
    various steps. First, a network node or user requests for a new transaction. After
    that, the transaction is recorded in the block format or structure. The block
    structure consists of the index, time-stamp, data, previous hash, and current
    block hash. 2) Transmission to Peer Nodes A block of transactions is broadcasted
    to the peer nodes available in the network. 3) Validation of Transactions The
    blockchain network uses SHA-256 algorithm for creating a unique hash. Each block
    in the blockchain is linked with the hash of the previous block which makes an
    unbreakable network of transactions. If someone tries to append a transaction,
    then it must be validated by the network nodes or by smart contracts, and consensus.
    This immutable ledger cannot be modified, it can only be appended to the transaction
    of blocks, which results in a secured and reliable decentralized system. Various
    algorithms are used to validate transactions and user status. 4) Block Added to
    Ledger The new transactions are first verified by the other nodes and then they
    are added in a new block for the ledger or chain. The existing blockchain is extended
    by addition of a new block that is unalterable and undeletable for any other users.
    B. Reference Architecture The blockchain reference architecture consists of three
    different networks which combine together and run the whole blockchain application
    for the users. The three different networks are the public network, cloud network,
    and enterprise network as shown in Fig 6. Each has its own capabilities and functionalities
    for the smooth working of the decentralized applications. FIGURE 6. A blockchain-based
    reference architecture. Show All 1) Public Network In this network, the users,
    edge services, and peer cloud providers are connected or linked together. a: Users
    In the public network, the users manage the distribution and creation of the blockchain
    decentralized application and execute the operations with the help of the blockchain
    network. Users have different roles as follows: b: Developer Developers make various
    types of applications for the client or users with different functionalities.
    They develop the smart contract for the interaction with the users which helps
    to add transactions or records within the blockchain network. The developers can
    also build the inheritance applications for facilitating communication in the
    blockchain. c: Administrator The functionality of the administrator is to produce,
    maintain, and configure decentralized applications for the blockchain network.
    d: Operator Operators have the control to monitor and manage the blockchain network
    and its applications. e: Auditor The blockchain auditors maintain or review the
    history of the transactions over the blockchain network for business and legal
    compliance point of view. f: Edge Services These services authorize the information
    that gets transferred via the internet to the cloud, enterprise applications,
    and client applications. They maintain systems such as domain name systems, content
    delivery networks, firewalls, and load balancers. Domain name systems are used
    to correct the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) of the web sites that are linked
    to the Transmission Control Protocol-Internet Protocol (TCP-IP) address for the
    system which is to be used for the resources. The content delivery network carries
    user applications, which gives the geolocation for the distributed systems which
    are installed to minimize the response time for the distributed users in the network.
    The firewall is responsible to maintain and give access control to the incoming
    and outgoing traffic in the network allowing or blocking the access. The load
    balancers are used for the distribution of the network traffic to maintain minimum
    response time, latency, and maximize throughput across the resources such as computers,
    processors, and storage systems. They are needed to balance the load in local
    and global systems. 2) Interaction Option In the blockchain, there are various
    ways through which users can interact with the blockchain network, they are shown
    below as: a: Software Development Kit The SDK is useful for facilitating interaction
    between applications and their platforms. Blockchain application development lifecycle
    has a number of phases such as developing phase, debugging phase, testing phase,
    and production phase. The blockchain applications need to interact and communicate
    with the network when the software development cycle executes. b: Client Software
    Development Kit It is a client-side programming library, which provides API methods
    to be used by the end user program to give access functionality within the blockchain
    network. The programs are written in Java, Python, and other languages and the
    kit also supports development tools. c: Command Line Interface Developers and
    administrator usually need activities such as monitoring, managing accounts of
    users, and importing & exporting some text commands formats. All these activities
    can be executed through the command line interface. 3) Cloud Network The cloud
    network consists of a variety of running nodes, each with its own capability and
    functionality. The cloud network includes the blockchain applications, application
    programming interface, blockchain services, security services, and system integration.
    a: Blockchain Applications There are various types of applications such as web
    application, end-user applications and server-based applications. Users play different
    roles such as business users, administrators, auditors, and operators. The blockchain
    applications use the APIs for the post and get services of the resources like
    databases. A variety of applications such as healthcare, financial sector, insurance,
    energy domain, supply-chain, and IoT can be enabled with the blockchain to minimize
    the cost and time [51]–[56]. b: Application Programming Interface An API is useful
    for the developers and users to reuse the data or information and its analytics
    with their services. It can be called by different cross-platform technologies.
    Blockchain technology provides various APIs for the application interfaces to
    use the components that can be handled in the business transactions. c: Blockchain
    Services For the performance and functional environment of the blockchain systems,
    there is a range of services such as: d: Members This service manages the user
    ids, credentials, and the history of users transactions in a confidential manner
    over the blockchain network. The permissioned network needs to validate the users
    of ongoing transactions and the users identification for the record of transaction
    and verification, so it requires membership in the network. In such networks,
    users have the access control to allow or block the transaction. In a non-permissioned
    network, it does not require the authorization by the user while submitting the
    transaction details. e: Consensus Consensus is a protocol in the blockchain network,
    which must be followed by each node in the network. This protocol specifies time
    validity and rules that need to be followed by all the nodes or users in the network
    to perform various tasks or append transactions in the blockchain network. It
    also maintains a copy of the ledger in the network. f: Ledger All the transactions
    are linked together with a cryptographic hash in the blocks to form a ledger.
    g: Smart Contract In general, a smart contract is a chain of the codes, which
    executes in the blockchain network environment. This code chain communicates the
    conditions or rules for different parties to follow the terms between the nodes
    or users in the network. Smart contract can be developed in the blockchain platform
    with the help of the supported programming languages. h: Secure Runtime In the
    secure runtime environment, blockchain transactions are added in the ledger with
    the secured container such as secure OS, and library of the programming language
    runtime used. i: Event Distribution In the blockchain network, the publisher notifies
    the subscribers for a specific event. The notification is sent in a broadcast
    manner within the network. Subscribers who subscribe to a specific publisher or
    events receive the notification. j: System Integration The blockchain services
    and the enterprise network are combined or integrated together via the application
    programming interface and enterprise service bus. k: Connectivity The connectivity
    between the cloud network and the enterprise network is established by the Virtual
    Private Network (VPN) or the gateway tunnel. It enables the secure connectivity
    and standard data format and filters within the blockchain network. 4) Enterprise
    Network The enterprise network consists of the enterprise directory, its applications,
    and the database. a: Enterprise User Directory In the enterprise applications,
    data or information regarding user authentication, authorization, and personal
    data of users are recorded. The gateway and virtual private network (VPN) maintain
    secured services for the access control of the users. b: Enterprise Applications
    These applications are used for the enterprise that communicates with the blockchain
    network. They also communicate with smart contracts in the network. Hence, smart
    contract collect and store the enterprise data in the network and share that information
    over the applications. They also make requests for availing the services in the
    blockchain network. c: Enterprise Data The enterprise application in the blockchain
    records and maintains the metadata of the system. It also maintains the feedback
    of the system that contains the entire history of the blockchain network. Transactional
    data contains all the records of the network which includes master repository,
    financial information, and business communication. All the data is available via
    data repository and distributed data storage. The second type of blockchain enterprise
    data is application data in which, data is collected and produced by enterprise
    applications and its operations. All the values are added for a better understanding
    of the application performance. The log data is recorded in log files for future
    inspection for the security, governance, or compliance. SECTION IV. Blockchain
    Deployment in Smart Applications The detailed taxonomy of blockchain deployment
    in real-time applications such as energy, healthcare, manufacturing, agriculture,
    business, digital content distribution, smart city, IoT [57], supply-chain & logistics,
    and tourism & hospitality [58] is shown in Fig. 7. Table 3 provides the detailed
    relative comparison of the State-of-the-art proposals/Tools used for blockchain-based
    security system. Parameters used for this comparison are objectives, techniques
    used, setup type, programming languages or simulators, pros, and cons of the existing
    tools/frameworks. TABLE 3 State-of-the-Art Proposals/Tools Used for Blockchain-Based
    Security System FIGURE 7. Taxonomy of Blockchain for Industry 4.0. Show All A.
    Supplychain and Logistics Agricultural applications need critical management inputs,
    such as supply-chain management (SCM) which plays a prominent role in human lives.
    Traditional logistic systems used in food-supply and agriculture simply store
    the orders and delivered them to the destination. These conventional systems have
    a lacuna with respect to various features such as auditability, traceability,
    and transparency [59]. However, in the modern digital era, these features can
    improve safety and food quality, and hence, there is a huge demand of good quality
    of food by consumers [60]. Hence, most of the research & development(R&D) organizations
    adopt IoT technologies such as wireless sensor networks (WSN), and radio frequency
    identifications (RFIDs), which remotely observe the food supply-chain. According
    to Caro et al. [61], most of the centralized cloud infrastructures are being used
    as current IoT solutions in SCM. These infrastructures usually have open issues
    like data integrity, lack of transparency, tampering and single point of failure.
    These issues can be handled in an efficient way by using blockchains. Decentralized
    trustful systems can be designed for the same by using the blockchain. A decentralized,
    blockchain-based solution named AgriBlockIoT, was proposed in [61] for Agri-Food
    SPM. It integrated various IoT sensor devices which produced and consumed data
    along the chain. The stored data can be accessed, and autonomous executable smart-contracts
    could be implemented through AgriblockIoT, with the objective of achieving transparency,
    and inflexibility of the records in an environment, that uses modern devices such
    as mini-PC and gateways. The performance and efficiency of AgriblockIoT are quantified
    in terms of CPU load, network traffic, and latency. The performance can be improved
    by working on the constrained hardware architectures. Perboli et al. [62] suggested
    that the blockchain improves the reliability, efficiency, and transparency of
    supply-chain, and speedup inbound processes. Though many IoT technologies are
    used for food safety and SCM, there are some issues which are not properly addressed.
    The major issue is to decide whether the information or data shared among the
    members of other supply-chain is trustworthy or not. To overcome this issue, authors
    of [60] proposed a system called Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP),
    which provided real-time food tracing information to all SCM members and has features
    like reliability, openness, neutrality, security, and transparency. Weber et al.
    [69] proposed a blockchain based decentralized solution to solve the problem of
    determining if the information or data shared among the members of the supply-chain
    is trustworthy in collaborative processes. They also discussed various notations
    and process models for business. The prototype model was implemented using blockchain
    and validated through business processes [70]. To execute business transactions
    securely, a model called business process management(BPM) was proposed by Guerreiro
    [71]. This model used the blockchain technology and an Enterprise Operating System
    (EOS). The risk involved in the secured execution of business transactions was
    eliminated in the proposed model by increasing trust, authenticity, robustness,
    and traceability against fraud. An Agricultural Supply Chain (ASC) system was
    presented in [68] by Leng et al. This system was completely dependent on the double
    chain architecture which accelerated the efficiency of the blockchain in the ASC.
    The authors suggested solutions to provide adaptive rent-seeking and matching
    mechanisms for public service platform. These solutions ensured transparency,
    security and privacy of the enterprise information. Moreover, the use of public
    service platform and the efficiency of the system were also improved. The proposed
    system had drawbacks mainly in terms of performance and increased size of the
    blockchain. Mao [72] proposed a credit evaluation system which was based on public
    blockchains. This system helped in the management and supervision especially for
    the food-supply chain to improve the effectiveness. In particular, the authors
    gathered the credit evaluation text from the traders by smart contracts on the
    blockchain, and then analyzed the text using a deep learning method named Long
    Short Term Memory (LSTM). Though the authors claimed the effectiveness of their
    method, but they did not consider the overall system costs and benefits. Due to
    these issues, they can not provide a standard methodology to design, develop,
    and validate the overall blockchain solution. Later on, the authors in [62] concentrated
    on one of the most critical issues, i.e, the implementation of the blockchain
    in the supply-chain with the need of including all the different actors. Moreover,
    the sharing of information along the entire blockchain could lead to inertia in
    adopting the solution. For this reason, a correct implementation of the blockchain
    technology in the supply-chain must starts from an analysis of the needs and the
    objectives of the different actors involved. Keeping this objective in mind, the
    authors created a business model capable of highlighting the returns in terms
    of both economic and customer satisfaction. Kshetri [65] presented an early evidence
    of linking the use of the blockchain in supply-chain activities to increase transparency
    and accountability. They also examined how the blockchain is likely to affect
    the key SPM objectives such as cost, quality, speed, dependability, risk reduction,
    sustainability, and flexibility. A public blockchain of the agricultural supply-chain
    system based on the double chain architecture was proposed by Leng et al. [68].
    In this system, the authors mainly focused on the dual chain structure and its
    storage mode, resource rent-seeking and matching mechanism, and consensus algorithm.
    The results exhibited that the double chain structure based agricultural supply-chain
    could take care of the openness and security of transaction information and the
    privacy of the enterprise information. It also had the ability to complete rent-seeking
    and matching of resources self-adaptively. Therefore, the proposed architecture
    greatly enhanced the credibility of the public service platform and the overall
    efficiency of the system. Table 4 provides the detailed relative comparison of
    the existing blockchain based approaches for supply-chain & logistics systems
    using the parameters such as the transparency, reliability, security, architecture,
    consensus mechanism, traceability system, framework, pros, and cons of the existing
    approaches. TABLE 4 Supply Chain Management With Blockchain Technology B. Energy
    Domain Energy is the actual base of our existence. It is essential to the lives
    of humans and all other living organisms on earth. Humans and all the living creatures
    on the earth cannot survive in the absence of energy. We use energy for a variety
    of purposes like food, Communication, transportation, heating/cooling, and lighting.
    All conventional transportation means such as trains, buses, automobiles, and
    airplanes work on energy, which is derived from electricity, and fossil fuels.
    Our food is grown with considerable energy expenditure, and its storage and transportation
    also consume energy. Our modes of communication, such as internet and telephones
    run on electricity. Sun is the major source of all energies available on the earth.
    It is very important to select the type of energy resources carefully, because
    it can lead to adverse effects on the environment such as global warming, and
    pollution. Energy resources are classified into two categories: non-renewable
    resources and renewable resources. The exponential use of non-renewable resources
    may lead to rare existence of these resources. So, it is very important to manage
    them with intense care and proper management. Proper usage of non-renewable resources
    has become mandatory due to their scarcity. The use of renewable energy sources
    such as solar power or wind can leverage energy efficiency to maintain the ecosystem
    [84]. Hence nowadays, most of the countries encourage their people to use renewable
    energy resources for the growth of their industries, agriculture, and transportation.
    1) Distributed Energy System Distributed Energy System (DES) is one of the important
    concepts in the energy domain. DES generates power on decentralized levels. It
    also enhances the overall throughput quality of the energy system by considering
    the parameters like energy production, economics, and environment. DES overcomes
    the many challenges of the centralized energy network systems and maximizes the
    use of renewable sources for a distributed generation of energy. With the use
    of IoT, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), DES has made it
    quite simple to monitor and maintain data and records. With its due popularity,
    DES has brought a significant improvement in the sector of electric utility which
    gives the ambit for the expansion of renewables empowered digital services. Nowadays,
    there are many evolving technologies are available which can simply convert energy
    into a digital. Using such technologies, we can keep a closer watch on a DES which
    is placed at a remote location. Moreover, the IoT plays a vital role in energy
    transitions and hence is adopted by DES. The presence of the blockchain and IoT
    facilitates a wide range of services enabled by the DES. In fact, the blockchain
    technology and IoT get the credit of giving a digital look to DES for energy transitions.
    The application of the blockchain in DES helps it to have a trustworthy data flow
    among emission traders, energy traders, energy producers, and operating staff.
    Digital DES offers a high level of security, and scope for decision making and
    processing based on the real conditions. The blockchain also helps to generate
    energy efficiently. There are numerous scenarios where energy sharing DES is more
    appropriate and better than the conventional DES. The Blockchain technology provides
    a decentralized energy trading platform for the imports and exports of energy,
    which can monitor electricity flows and aid to maintain them by time stamping
    [77]. DES is a truly intelligent system that provides a broad range of services
    in various stages such as the operating stage, development phase, energy trading
    stage, and energy metering phase. Authors of [77] did not highlight the issues
    like old grid infrastructure, reliability, energy loss, stability, environmental
    concerns, obsolete design, less efficiency in transmission, generation and distribution.
    Truby [76] described how to improve environmentally sustainable development of
    the blockchain applications. Their study was based on the fiscal policy and regulatory
    approaches for the digital currencies [54]. This research led them towards the
    proposal and establishment of some new policy tools and legal tools which are
    required for the consumption of energy with the usage of blockchain technologies.
    Authors [76] also came up with the fiscal policy for the same purpose and suggested
    the use of the blockchain technology. 2) Microgrid Small-scale power stations
    which have their own production as well as storage resources are known as microgrids.
    A microgrid always has definite boundaries. It can be perceived as a tiny cluster
    of electricity users who have a local source of electricity supply. The clusters
    are connected to a national grid which operates independently. If a microgrid
    is connected to the main grid, it is known as a hybrid microgrid. Decentralized
    Energy Resources (DER) such as diesel generators, PV Panels and a group of loads
    are integrated with Energy Storage Systems (ESS) like flywheels and batteries
    to form a microgrid and provide electricity [73]. Decentralized flexibility created
    by renewable energy sources can be easily reduced by approach, i.e, microgrids.
    Goranović et al. [85] suggested the two approaches for controlling electric grids,
    i.e, decentralized and centralized monitoring systems. In the centralized monitoring
    systems, an operator is accountable to execute the whole system. The use of centralized
    control devices needs expensive infrastructure. Centralized systems measure and
    process the data and then set proper proceeding in the circumstances. Multiple
    points can be made available in the system through which information is sent and
    received by the communication channels and centralized control devices. The major
    drawback in this mechanism is that the use of multiple points in the centralized
    system increases the probability of system failure. This limitation of the centralized
    system can be conquered by the decentralized system where each device independently
    controls itself. The decentralized system also improves the fault tolerance and
    communication speed of the system. The decentralized blockchain is precisely suitable
    to implement business processes in microgrids using smart contracts [86]. Authors
    of this paper also provided a few examples of the blockchain projects for microgrids
    with certain technical parameters. The type of the blockchain, consensus mechanism
    and availability of parts required in the hardware development or open source
    were the technical parameters considered by the authors for describing the example
    microgrid projects [85]. A brief summary of these projects is given below. PowerLedger:
    It was a blockchain based market clearing & trading mechanism [87]. It included
    the use of private Ethereum with Proof-of-Work (PoW) and public eco-chain that
    employed proof-of-Stack (PoS). This was an open source project. Share&Charge:
    It was a group of Electric Based Vehicle (EBV) charging stations [88] which used
    public Ethereum and consensus algorithm as a PoW. Owners can register his or her
    station to fix charging tariffs. Any charging station could be integrated and
    combined to Share&Charge network [73] through Share&Charge module. NRGcoin: This
    framework was based on energy cryptocurrency developed through a smart contract.
    It operated through gateways which simply calculated the flow of electricity and
    communicated through a smart contract. GrunStromJeton: It was an Ethereum based
    conceptual framework developed to verify the actual use of electricity. It used
    PoA as a consensus mechanism. SolarCoin: It was developed to enhance the mass
    production of solar energy. Due to the lengthy setup process, customers usually
    do not go for solar installations. This project aimed at eliminating this problem
    by giving rewards to buyers. One solarCoin was given as a reward per produced
    MWh. It used PoW as a consensus mechanism and bitcoin as cryptocurrency. GridSingulartiy:
    It was a decentralized data exchange framework specially designed for energy sector
    emphasizing on electricity, water, gas, and heat. In this platform, PoA and PoW
    were the consensus algorithms which used public Ethereum. Electron: It is a Company
    which works in the energy sector and provides Ethereum based better solutions.
    Apart from the above projects, people are currently working on numerous projects
    in the same domain. Table 5 provides the detailed relative comparison of the existing
    blockchain-based approaches in the energy domain using parameters such as the
    objective, transparency, reliability, security, architecture, consensus mechanism,
    traceability system, framework, pros, and cons of the existing approaches. TABLE
    5 Energy Applications With Blockchain Technology C. Digital Content Distribution
    Since the commercialization of the internet in 1994, delivery services of digital
    content has been increased exponentially. [89]. Delivery systems are mainly of
    two types: non-protected and protected delivery systems. Generally, digital content
    is protected using the conventional encryption mechanism. Different encryption
    mechanisms use different ways to generate, propagate, and maintain the keys and
    decrypt the encrypted content with keys. Traditional systems such as Conditional
    Access System and Digital Rights Management (DRM) are popular for protecting digital
    content, but face some major issues like network attacks, stealing of keys, and
    pirate attacking. To overcome the drawbacks of the conventional centralized system,
    the authors of [89] proposed a decentralized digital content distribution system
    based on the blockchain. In this digital content system, the owner of the actual
    content could supervise and control the security as well as simplicity. The use
    of the mining techniques ensured that the addition of each type of transaction
    to the blockchain. PoW was used as the consensus mechanism to guarantee the security
    and privacy of the transactions stored in the blockchain. Due to some open issues
    such as pirate attacking, it was not possible to entirely control this mechanism.
    Table 6 provides the detailed relative comparison of the existing blockchain-based
    approaches in the digital content distribution domain using parameters such as
    the objective, transparency, reliability, security, architecture, consensus mechanism,
    traceability system, framework, immutability of the blockchain, advantages, and
    drawbacks of the existing approaches. TABLE 6 Distribution With Blockchain Technology
    D. Toursism and Hospitality Industry Tourism is the process of spending time to
    outside station, i.e, away from our home for purposes such as business purpose,
    personal purpose, relaxation and pleasure. Serving travelers is the major functionality
    of the tourism Industry. Nowadays, most of the people search and book their traveling
    tickets, food, and lodging online with the use of the internet. Therefore, the
    worldwide usage of the internet, the tourism and hospitality industry has witnessed
    rapid changes. In this digital world, many tourism companies like Expedia Group,
    BCD Travel, Uber, Ola, and AirBnb have replaced their traditional business models
    by Consumer-to-Consumer (C2C) models to achieve transparency and security in transactions.
    There is a huge demand for innovative platforms in the tourism industry, which
    can integrate technology, money, and knowledge. TUI and many other companies have
    already started using the blockchain for implementing the functionalities like
    booking tickets and making payments. Many companies like Expedia, CheapAir, Webjet,
    and One Shot Hotels use bitcoins for the travel purpose, i.e, to book and reserve
    tickets. Digital currencies simply integrate with smart contracts which have enough
    potential to develop highly disruptive technologies for the tourism industry.
    Authors of [99] suggested three prepositions which helped to highlight some open
    issues in the tourism industry. These prepositions mainly focus on the customer’s
    point of view and market implementation’s point of view. The prepositions include:
    I) New Type of evaluation as well as review techniques which can build trustworthy
    systems for rating purpose. II) The extensive adoption of digital cryptocurrencies
    for C2C markets. III) Use of blockchain leads to increase of disintermediation
    in the tourism industry. In the case study part of our paper, we try to highlight
    the above issues in the tourism industry. The detailed explanation of the same
    is available in the case studies section. E. Smart Healthcare Health is the most
    valuable asset of any nation. In traditional healthcare, all patient related data
    is stored in a centralized way and therefore, it is not advisable to give access
    of data to any untrusted third party. Moreover, the privacy and security of patient
    information must be maintained as it is vulnerable to a variety of attacks [121].
    A centralized architecture cannot fulfill these requirements completely. Hence,
    smart healthcare is introduced to deal with the above mention issues in conventional
    healthcare systems. Smart healthcare focuses on monitoring and diagnosing patients’
    health remotely through wireless communication channels. It collects the necessary
    information of various patients through heterogeneous wearable devices and sensors.
    Enormous data is collected for a large number of patients. It is a big issue to
    analyze and store this data in a secured manner. These data should also be shared
    securely among trusted parties such as hospitals, patients, doctors, and medical
    stores. Secure communication of these data is pivotal as it affects important
    decisions such as planning of new services in the hospital, recommending doctors,
    analyzing symptoms of different diseases or health issues, and improving the overall
    system to make it intelligent. Table 7 provides a detailed relative comparison
    of the state-of-the-art healthcare security standards used for smart healthcare.
    These standards are compared using the parameters such as access management, security
    maturity, reduction in cost and complexity, and improvement in healthcare compliance.
    For the various medical research activities, deciding treatments, and analyzing
    symptoms of diseases, patients’ data is required to be shared periodically. Traditional
    access control policies are not secured enough to share highly sensitive patient
    records from one party to another. Moreover, in most of the cases, patients do
    not share their medical history with the doctors. In case of a medical emergency,
    medical records of the patient are necessary, but the same is not available due
    to poor record maintenance. All the above-mentioned issues can be solved by smart
    healthcare using Electronic Health Records (EHR). Though smart healthcare is capable
    of solving the major issues in the healthcare industry, there are some challenges
    to be addressed. Access control policy for EHR, privacy, security, and availability,
    are open issues in smart healthcare. The blockchain technology can be used to
    get solutions to these issues. In fact, the blockchain has the potential to support
    smart healthcare through the distributed ledger among various users such as patients,
    doctors, medical stores, and insurance agencies. TABLE 7 Worldwide State-of-the-art
    Healthcare Security Standards Authors of [100] proposed a blockchain-based intelligent
    application commonly known as Healthcare Data Gateway (HDG). Patients can securely
    share and control their data through a secured data gateway. It processes and
    manages patients’ data without any concern about the third party. HDG consists
    of three layers namely Data Usage, Data Management, and Storage. Entities that
    use healthcare data such as physicians, companies, government, and researchers
    are associated with the data usage layer. In the data management layer, HDGs independently
    connected to each other. This layer also manages all types of metadata such as
    patients’ data, schemas, and indices information. The storage layer prevents the
    attacks on integrity and confidentiality by providing secure and scalable storage
    for the healthcare system. Azaria et al. [101] developed a decentralized MedRec
    model which was a novel data management system for large scale EHR. In this proposal,
    confidentiality, authentication, and accountability of health records were maintained
    via a comprehensive log using blockchain-based MedRec model. Authors of [102]
    developed a new architecture for the medical field especially for precision medicine
    and clinical trial. This architecture had four new components: I) Blockchain-based
    parallel and distributed computing component to examine parallel computing using
    data analytics, II) Trustworthy information sharing component to enable a trustworthy
    medical data system for collaborative research, III) Application data management
    component to maintain the integrity of data, and to integrate dissimilarity of
    medical data, IV) Verifiable unknown identity management component for maintaining
    identity privacy for IoT, person and devices as well as secured access to patient-centric
    medicine data. Authors of [103] developed a reliable healthcare system on the
    basis of Pervasive Social Network (PSN) using different protocols. The first protocol
    was an extended version of IEEE 802.15.6 display authenticated association. It
    was used to establish secured links by means of unbalanced computational requirements
    for mobile devices and resource-restricted sensor nodes. Health data was shared
    between PSN nodes with the help of the second protocol which was based on the
    help blockchain technique. The authors examined the proposed protocols and other
    factors for evaluating the performance. The proposed system demonstrated the possibility
    of using the blockchain technology, especially for PSN-based applications. Though
    the performance of the proposed system was not measured on a mass-scale healthcare
    system, i.e, PSN-based system, as stated by the authors, the performance of the
    proposed system could be improved in terms of transport and monitoring of the
    environment. Authors of [104] discussed a viewpoint on the blockchain founded
    healthcare data management system. They also bestowed a framework for sharing,
    managing EMR, especially for the patients suffering from cancer. The proposed
    architecture included a user interface as well as the backend. The backend comprised
    of the components such as membership services, certification authority, clusters
    of nodes, load balancer, and distinct cloud storages for patients’ certificates
    and data. This work substantially reduced turnaround time for EMR sharing, increased
    the power of decision making for the sake of medical care, and also reduced the
    overall system cost. The proposed system also guaranteed the availability, security,
    privacy, and access control across the EMR data. Xia et al. [105] developed a
    trustworthy blockchain-based system called “MeDShare” especially to handle the
    challenges of maintaining voluminous medical information on a cloud using big
    data for data provenance. Activities such as sharing and transition of information
    were recorded and stored in a tamper-proof manner. The authors also compared the
    performance of “MeDShare” with the existing methods of data sharing and came up
    with the conclusion that auditing and data provenance could be achieved by cloud
    service providers through the MeDShare. Risk factors of data privacy were also
    minimized through the proposed system, but issues such as scalability, data interoperability
    and key management were not highlighted in the paper. Rifi et al. [106] discussed
    the important problems such as scalability and interoperability, and highlighted
    the advantages of including the blockchain technology for medical data exchange
    to achieve the best performance. Liang et al. [107] developed a user-driven health
    information sharing solution to handle the issues of privacy and identity management.
    To address these issues, they suggested the use of the channel formation scheme
    and membership service of the blockchain. The authors also proposed a mobile-controlled
    system based on hyperledger fabric with the use of permissioned blockchains. The
    proposed work majorly focused on the validation of the network nodes, and the
    preservation of healthcare-related data. A new blockchain-based information model
    was proposed by Magyar et al. [108]. This model basically integrated complex Electronic
    Healthcare Data (EHD). The implementation of a decentralized and purely expendable
    network was possible due to the use of cryptographic tools and the blockchain.
    The model was developed by considering the basic beliefs of the HIPAA regulation
    existing in America. The proposed work ensured information availability and resolved
    the issue of data privacy at the same time, although the authors did not provide
    any algorithm or method to handle the EHD related issues such as integrity, security,
    portable user-owned data, and interoperability. Jiang et al. [110] focused on
    the fact that everyday huge number of healthcare-related data are produced by
    individuals and hospitals. This data is very beneficial in the medical industry
    for various purposes. It is quite challenging and important to store this data
    securely. It is must to have mechanisms to maintain confidentiality, privacy and
    integrity of data. By keeping these requirements in mind, the authors developed
    a BLOCkchain-based model for Healthcare Information Exchange(BlocHIE), which resolved
    the above-listed issues. In this mechanism, they considered two types of healthcare-related
    data - personal healthcare related data and electronic medical records. They performed
    analysis of various ways and requirements to share and store the healthcare related
    data. The framework was based on two blockchains which were loosely-coupled and
    one was an EMR-chain and the other was a data-chain. Different methods and techniques
    of chain verification, as well as storage, were integrated to ensure authentication
    and privacy. The authors also developed two transaction packaging algorithms such
    as TP&FAIR and FAIR-FIRST for PHRD-Chain and EMRChain respectively, which increased
    the fairness, efficiency, and system throughput among the users. These two packaging
    algorithms were evaluated in terms of throughput and fairness using the BlocHIE
    mechanism. As claimed by the authors, the FAIRFIRST algorithm increased the fairness
    and the TP&FAIR algorithm increased the throughput. Nowadays the blockchain is
    being used worldwide in the medical field to maintain and store the healthcare
    related data securely. Theodouli et al. [111] said that this data could be used
    for further innovation and research in the healthcare industry. By considering
    the needs of the healthcare industry, the authors of [111] proposed a design architecture
    for a system which can easily secure permission management and data sharing for
    the healthcare with the help of the blockchain features. The proposed infrastructure
    consisted of three layers: Web/cloud platform layer, Cloud middleware layer, and
    Blockchain network layer. As shown in the paper, this model could help to enhance
    security and integrity to a good extent. This model was also used in the KONFIDO
    project to verify the parameters such as interoperability and data exchange. According
    to the authors, and the proposed model gave additional benefit with respect to
    workflow automation, patient pseudonymity, accountability, auditing, and data
    integrity. Fig 8, gives an idea about the use of blockchain technology in smart
    healthcare. Table 8 provides a detailed relative comparison of the existing blockchain-based
    approaches for smart healthcare. Parameters used for this comparison are the objective,
    security, architecture, simulation tool or framework, hardware, and physical design,
    benefits and drawbacks of the existing approaches. TABLE 8 State-of-the-Art Blockchain
    Based Approaches to Secure Healthcare 4.0 FIGURE 8. Blockchain in smart healthcare.
    Show All F. Smartcity In smart city implementations, heterogeneous sensors are
    used by various smart devices and users to collect the required data. These data
    are processed and used in traffic management, transportation systems, waste management,
    schools, libraries, water supply networks, community services, and power plants
    to improve the performance. There is a gradual increase in the number of people
    living in city areas. Due to increased use of the Internet, big data [129], and
    IoT, the concept of a smart city has become very popular. To strengthen the development
    of the smart cities, we need effective mechanisms to solve the existing problems
    related to energy, transportation, governance, and environment. Some open issues
    such as deficient security in IoT, difficulty in maintenance and upgradation of
    equipment, maintaining the trust among the internet users, optimizing the cost
    of running data centers, damage resistance, privacy, and security need to be addressed
    to deploy smart city projects effectively and efficiently. According to the authors
    of [128], the blockchain technology is the potential of solving all these problems
    and hence, it is best suited for developing smart city solutions. As we know,
    the consumption of energy increases due to urban development. The purpose of the
    internet is to develop an intelligent energy system. Authors in [128] mainly focused
    on how the blockchain could help to solve the problems in the internet, big data,
    and IoT [15], [16]. In this research, issues such as user’s creditability, the
    creditability of the data in the central database, data privacy protection, and
    privacy protection of data were addressed. In the proposed work, the blockchain
    identified valid IoT nodes and denied the system access by malicious nodes. It
    also maintained data privacy in IoT and improved storage and computing abilities
    with the help of decentralized databases. As shown in the paper, the proposed
    work effectively prevented various attacks on the network infrastructure with
    improved recovery mechanism in big data [130]. Various architectural issues in
    the network infrastructure of the smart city were discussed by Sharma and Park
    [126]. Due to the exponential rise in information volume as well as the increase
    in the count of connected IoT devices, different issues such as bandwidth, security,
    latency, and scalability emerge in the existing smart city frameworks. To address
    these issues, authors in [126] proposed a hybrid architecture for a smart city.
    It was divided into two partitions: edge and core network through the hybrid architecture
    scheme. Moreover, this architecture was developed by considering all the strengths
    of the distributed as well as centralized architectures. In this paper, the authors
    also suggested the PoW scheme to strengthen privacy and security. They simulated
    the proposed model by evaluating feasibility and performance based on different
    performance metrics such as latency, and throughput. Authors also came up with
    a software-defined networking (SDN) and blockchain-based hybrid network architecture,
    although they did not focus on important parameters like how to deploy edge nodes,
    how to enable the caching technique at edge nodes etc. Due to this research gap,
    there is a tremendous scope of work in this domain in the near future. Biswas
    and Muthukkumarasamy [122] proposed a four-layer security based framework which
    was developed using the decentralized blockchain technology. It was integrated
    with smart devices that provided a secure and trustworthy communication model
    for a smart city. The proposed framework comprised of four layers- the physical
    layer, communication layer, database layer, and interface layer. In the physical
    layer, multiple standards were defined for smart devices using which data collected
    could be shared and integrated. The blockchain protocols were used to integrate
    with the communication layer to provide privacy and security of the transmitted
    data. The authors also suggested that the extensive use of the private ledger
    could lead to the improvement in performance, efficiency, and security for various
    real-time applications such as smart parking of vehicles, smart cleaning, smart
    home, and traffic control system in a smart city [131]. Scalability achieved by
    this framework was also up to the mark. As shown in Fig. 9, the proposed model
    had good features like fault tolerance, reliability, capability, and faster execution
    of the operation. Due to the use of the blockchain, various smart devices were
    able to communicate in a distributed environment. The major gap found in this
    paper is that the proposed model not missed to focus on some of the important
    issues like scalability and interoperability of the heterogeneous platforms. FIGURE
    9. Framework for smart city. Show All Rivera et al. [123] defined a smart city
    as the use of information technology (IT) to make the life of citizens more better
    and comfortable [125]. A smart city is a digital world which interconnects various
    areas such as government offices, schools, healthcare, colleges, and the economy.
    Nowadays, the unique identity of users is the biggest concern in business and
    smart city environments. Many researchers and developers have attempted to develop
    a reliable technology which can accurately determine the users’ identities. These
    attempts have used various attributes such as name, address, health status, hobbies,
    and credit record of the users. The digital identity is significantly important
    as it plays a vital role in security measures for interconnected devices in a
    smart city. The authors of [125] failed to highlight some of the important issues
    like smart energy, architecture, and SDN based security in the development of
    a smart city. In [124], Liao et al. focused on some important issues of smart
    cities like interoperability and transparency of various services. Due to the
    advancement in technology, fair and transparent services are demanded by the citizens
    in a smart city. Lottery game is an important segment in a smart city application,
    but it has a deficiency in terms of fairness and transparency. Therefore, the
    authors of [124] came up with an optimal solution to improve the transparency
    and fairness of a lottery system. They designed a blockchain-based transparent
    lottery system for a smart city. The authors proposed a three-layered blockchain-based
    lottery system known as FairLotto which used four lightweight protocols. Closing
    time, lottery purchase, initialization, and verifying winning numbers were the
    four different lottery stages in the proposed system. Equal possibility of winning
    the prize for each and every participant was guaranteed by this four-layered architecture.
    FairLotto effectively ensured transparency and did not store any financial transactions
    in the blockchain. Due to this, the transactional privacy was preserved and fairness
    and transparency were achieved in the lottery system. However, there was a lack
    of connectivity and service integration in the lottery system. Moreover, the authors
    also implemented Fairlotto system in Ethereum, but the results of the numerical
    analysis on the performance were not provided. These two were the major research
    gaps in the proposed work. Table 9 provides a detailed relative comparison of
    the existing blockchain-based approaches for smart city applications. We use parameters
    such as the objective, digital identity, security, architecture, smart energy,
    smart parking and automation, smart traffic, green environment, advantages, and
    drawbacks of the existing approaches for making this comparison. TABLE 9 Smart
    City Development With Blockchain Technology G. Business The Blockchain is a decentralized
    technique used for the secured exchange of cryptocurrency and financial transactions.
    Each user maintains its distributed ledger which is useful for validating a new
    transaction. Bitcoin is a medium of digital cryptocurrency that provides transactions
    in a secured and distributed environment. The group of all executed bitcoin transactions
    performed in the past is called a distributed ledger. After every successful transaction,
    an authentic user has to make changes in the distributed ledger which is distributed
    over the network and shared by all users in the network. As hash functions are
    used in the formation of the blockchain, data integrity, confidentiality, and
    privacy are maintained across all the transactions. Singh and Singh [73] discussed
    the importance of blockchain in business, banking, and financial applications.
    It has enough potential to reorganize the business market industry. Use of block-chain
    reduces the risks, cost, probability of cyber attacks in financial organizations,
    and precise auditing of organizations can be achieved. Authors simply discussed
    the use of blockchain in the business application is highly desirable and convenient,
    due to its characteristics. They did not suggest any basic architecture for a
    business application to overcome the problems of blockchain like interoperability
    and scalability. Nguyen [132] discussed that sustainable development in finance
    can be achieved through the inclusion of the secured blockchain. This technology
    could bring various benefits for the existing banking system as well as society.
    It could increase the speed and efficiency of execution, optimize the transaction
    time and networks of record keeping, reduce the cost of financial transactions,
    and improve the probable chances of accessing the financial market. Nowadays,
    still there are no complete legal rules and regulations for cryptocurrencies and
    bitcoins. Hence, the use of the blockchain is a big challenge in the payment industry.
    Rimba et al. [133] provided a comparison of cloud services and blockchains for
    Business Process Execution (BPE). Based on the experimental results, the authors
    showed that the cost of Ethereum based process execution is higher as compared
    to the cost for business process execution on Amazon SWF, but authors ignored
    to formulate a method which could estimate the execution cost depending on the
    model as well as data collected in the past. Moreover, this paper did not describe
    how to minimize latency and execution cost. Lundbak and Huth [134] discussed that
    consensus and trust could be achieved in a distributed network through the blockchain.
    Thus, many private and governmental sectors, central banks, insurance and finance
    agencies, academic institutions, and especially some startups in Europe focus
    on the implementation of the blockchain in their routine operations. Improper
    implementation of the blockchain may lead the industrial standards and agendas
    to non-secured operations. The authors of [134] devised an oligarchic approach
    to authenticate and secure business processes and data. Their approach shared
    the business data without exposing the sensible information and resolved numerous
    issues of game-theoretic mining but it was not able to prevent uncertain behavior
    such as cheating. The authors of [135] described an algorithm to ensure data confidentiality
    in an untrustworthy environment. This algorithm translated the Business Process
    Execution Language (BPEL) into a highly confidential smart contract, but this
    algorithm did not meet the basic security pillars such as data integrity, correctness,
    and authenticity. The implementation of the blockchain may help to resolve the
    above-mentioned issues. Johng et al. [136] presented a framework to improve the
    trust in business processes using the blockchain. This framework mainly focused
    on issues like transparency and immutability. It also improved the trust among
    different stakeholders. Though the framework was not capable of resolving issues
    like traceability, the authors tried to build a process meta-model for supply-chain
    through the same mechanism. An end-to-end model for Real Time Gross Settlement
    (RTGS) through hyperledger fabric blockchain platform was designed by the authors
    of [137]. The proposed system made the payment service more secure and efficient.
    It used a timestamp algorithm which resolved the problem of gridlock and the risk
    of privacy. This framework was not generic for diverse payment services. A more
    generic platform can be developed through the blockchain technology [138]. Mendling
    et al. [139] discussed the execution of business processes beyond organizational
    boundaries through the blockchain without the inclusion of any trusted third party,
    although the authors did not explain how to resolve the existing issues such as
    latency, bandwidth, throughput, and size in the proposed work. Table 10 provides
    a detailed relative comparison of the existing blockchain-based approaches for
    the business domain. Parameters used for this comparison are Business Process
    Service(BPS), trust management, security, architecture, consensus mechanism, cost
    model, monetary policy, pros, and cons of the existing approaches. TABLE 10 Business
    in Blockchain Technology H. Internet of Things In the Internet of Things (IoT),
    various devices are connected through the internet to share useful information
    via servers for performing specific tasks or actions in the external environment
    such as measuring temperature or humidity and moving of shaft. Delivering the
    right information to the right people at the right time is possible through the
    use of IoT. Various sensors continuously sense the data and these collected data
    can be used for effective decision making. Things connected to the internet are
    expected to cross 50 billion in the near future, which is basically an approach
    of how these various devices should be designed and integrated with each other,
    so as to deliver a service delivery network, which can serve the needs in the
    future. The architecture of IoT is basically the backbone of any application and
    thus, it should be crafted carefully considering the needs of the evolution of
    functionality, scalability, availability, and maintainability. From this IoT architecture
    model, it is very clear to know that security is an essential factor in all IoT
    layers as shown in Fig. 10. FIGURE 10. IoT architecture model. Show All Nowadays,
    most of the IoT devices are not fully secured and can be easily hacked. These
    devices have restricted network capacity, limited computation power, and small
    storage capacity. Due to these characteristics, such devices are vulnerable to
    a variety of attacks as compared to computer systems. Samaniego and Deters [141]
    observed that the issues of network latency occurred due to cloud-centric IoT
    systems. To overcome these problems, they developed a software-defined IoT management
    construct known as Virtual Resources (VR). Tamper-proof, decentralized blockchains
    have the potential to solve security issues in any IoT Implementation. To use
    the blockchain as a service for the IoT, hosting environment is one of the challenges.
    Edge devices have limited computational resources as well as bandwidth, thus making
    fog or cloud as the potential hosts. The authors of [142] surveyed and categorized
    some important IoT related security challenges and requirements. The same were
    tabulated and mapped against the existing state-of-the-art solutions. The authors
    suggested the integration of the blockchain as a key solver for such challenges
    and also outlined the research issues which must be addressed in future, that
    could provide scalable, reliable, and efficient security solutions for the IoT.
    Singh et al. [143] observed that the current security technologies do not have
    the potential to secure IoT applications from various cyber-attacks in the business
    domain. They also suggested three different patterns of the blockchain-based security
    model for the IoT. There are various distributed ledger protocols suitable for
    the IoT Implementation such as hyperledger fabric, Ethereum, and Internet of Things
    Application (IOTA) [144]. In this paper, the performance of these protocols was
    compared for the development of IoT applications. The authors also presented three
    different architectures for the same. The architectures differ in the position
    of key storage and Ethereum blockchain which enhanced the security and reduced
    the network traffic. The problem with these architectures was that they were not
    capable of monitoring the IoT devices’ transactions automatically. Huh et al.
    [145] developed a new way to manage a few numbers of IoT devices with the use
    of Ethereum and computing platform. They used three Raspberry Pis, and smartphones
    and proposed three smart contracts which used public keys and signatures to track
    meter values and save the values of light bulbs and air conditioners. Malicious
    attacks on smart contracts could be detected and ignored by the computing systems
    of light bulbs and air conditioners. However, the proposed work failed to resolve
    issues such as Denial of Service (DoS) and synchronization. Moreover, the proposed
    mechanism considered a small number of IoT devices and thus was unable to implement
    a full-fledged IoT system for multiple devices. Liao et al. [146] presented various
    design issues and an architectural approach for the blockchain-based IoT services.
    Design decisions could be carried out by developers with the help of this architecture.
    Unfortunately, the proposed work failed to show the adverse effects on architectural
    attributes like robustness, efficiency, and security. Reyna et al. [147] analyzed
    the major challenges of IoT Integration such as scalability and storage capacity,
    data privacy and anonymity, and consensus mechanisms. They identified the potential
    benefits of the blockchain for the IoT and also suggested different topologies
    for the integration. Some key points to enhance the performance and feasibility
    of IoT applications with the help of the blockchain was also discussed in the
    paper. Table 11 provides the detailed relative comparison of the existing blockchain-based
    approaches for the IoT. This comparison has been done using parameters such as
    reliability, encryption, security management, edge computing, architecture, consensus
    mechanism, threat model, framework implementation, advantages, and disadvantages
    of the existing approaches. TABLE 11 Internet of Things in Blockchain Technology
    I. Manufacturing The process of manufacturing includes several elements such as
    operations management, asset management, intelligent manufacturing, planning,
    the interaction of humans and machines, performance optimization, performance
    monitoring, and end-to-end operational visibility. Li et al. [157] stated that
    the IoT has converted the conventional manufacturing processes into a smart manufacturing
    process. The IoT enabled manufacturing is far smarter and efficient than cloud
    manufacturing, as it speeds up the flow of production especially in the manufacturing
    plant, management of inventories & warehouses, and observation of development
    cycles by using IoT devices. Due to this, most of the manufacturing companies
    have invested crores of funds in the implementation of the IoT applications. The
    use of the IoT in the field of manufacturing and logistics will rise to 40 Billion
    by 2020 [162]. Due to the characteristics of the IoT such as greater energy efficiency,
    predictive maintenance, higher product quality, reduced downtime, speed, and more
    informed decisions, it has various applications in the manufacturing plants [163].
    As we know, energy is one of the largest expenses for manufacturing Industry,
    energy efficiency must be achieved which can be done through IoT based smart manufacturing.
    The authors of [159] proposed a trusted FabRec prototype, which linked physical
    devices and various computing nodes through a decentralized platform. In this
    prototype, transparency was ensured through audit trails. In the decentralized
    network, the authors developed smart contracts for the autonomous interaction
    of nodes in the absence of human involvement. The proposed architecture used a
    proof of concept linked with the nodes and physical devices and enabled smart
    manufacturing. Cloud-based manufacturing basically use the centralized networks
    which have problems such as security, flexibility, availability, and efficiency.
    To resolve such issues, the authors of [157] discussed and developed a blockchain-based
    distributed network architecture known as BVmfg. This architecture had a total
    five layers which improved the trust between the service providers and users for
    secured service sharing. The authors evaluated the performance of BCmfg a case
    study in which for fifteen end users and five service providers, scalability,
    and security were improved. Later, the authors revised their prototype and developed
    a shop floor and machine level data sharing prototype [160]. Authors used a public
    blockchain for shop level and a private blockchain for service providers through
    which important data is collected and gathered. The new prototype was level 2
    Point-to-point (P2P) network implemented through the blockchain. It handled cloud
    manufacturing challenges like security and centralization effectively. The authors
    of [158] proposed a blockchain and private cloud based manufacturing four-layer
    knowledge sharing system for Injection Mould Redesign (IMR). This work provided
    the rules and standards for the secured implementation of the system in a trusted
    environment. It also provided a knowledge sharing mechanism for the owners through
    which their data, as well as assets, could be shared securely among them. The
    system used the k- nearest neighbor retrieval method which improved the efficiency
    of the search process. The proposed model was limited to only some applications
    and not fully developed for many applications. The authors of [161] investigated
    various industrial requirements such as scalability and adaptability of the network
    with the implementation using OMNeT++ network simulator. Their approach was efficient
    up to the first fourteen participating lines and no uncertainty was identified.
    Table 12 provides the detailed relative comparison of the existing blockchain-based
    approaches for manufacturing using the parameters such as scalability, architecture,
    security, simulation/framework, smart contract, pros, and cons of the existing
    approaches. TABLE 12 Manufacturing With Blockchain Technology J. Agriculture In
    recent times, various issues related to food safety have been observed. Higher
    use of fertilizers and pesticides on agricultural products is the major concern
    in food safety. Pesticides and fertilizers residues on various agricultural products
    have caused world-wide concern [165]. Due to this, there is a huge demand for
    safe agricultural products in the market. To fulfill this demand, we need secured
    solutions for handling the perfect tracing and management of the production, wholesale,
    logistics to retail, production standards, certifications, and business reputation
    [166]. Hua et al. [164] proposed a blockchain-based agricultural tracking system,
    which was basically a decentralized system in order to solve the trust crisis
    in the domain of supply-chain. This blockchain-based agriculture platform recorded
    the information about the production, storage, transportation, processing, distribution
    and supply-chain of agricultural products for the third parties like government,
    insurance companies, customers, and banks. The platform recorded all the agriculture
    product related information on the blockchain structures, as it could involve
    different users such as companies, agencies, banks, or government to work together.
    By considering the requirements, the authors developed an agricultural traceability
    system for the same. This system considered the fertilizers, pesticides, companies,
    seeds, agricultural operations, time, and residue testing. According to the authors,
    it was a very tedious task to build a platform having a uniform structure, which
    considered all the complex information and eliminated the possibility of the redundancy
    in data. Hence, the authors designed two related structures especially for the
    basic planting information as well as for provenance records. Planting information
    included the source production information in terms of identity, species name,
    planting-time, company-name, greenhouse number, and geographical location. Provenance
    records include the details about the agricultural operations in terms of identity,
    date & time, person, digital-signature, location, operation-type, inputs & memo,
    and company. The agriculture tracking platform consisted of three components-
    data node, clients and registration center. The issues in the agriculture system
    such as creditability of data and integration the subsystems were easily handled
    by this open data-sharing platform. Due to this, any participant could view the
    data uploaded by any participating companies, which was also one of the major
    advantages of this platform. According to Tian et al. [63], food safety is the
    major concern, especially in China. As China is an agricultural country, the annual
    demand for vegetables and fruits is approximately 730 million tons [167]. Due
    to the huge demand of the market, traditional agri-food logistics are not capable
    of handling this situation. There are some open challenges in traditional agri-food
    logistic systems such as deficiency of funds and modern equipment, shortfall of
    a monitorable traceability system, moderate level of information, and unordered
    regulatory systems. Therefore, there are massive and frequent brokedown events
    of food safety in China. To overcome the limitations of the traditional agri-food
    logistic systems, the authors of [63] proposed a blockchain and RFID-based agri-food
    supply chain traceability system. This system significantly improved the quality
    and safety of food, and also reduced the probability of different losses in the
    conventional logistics process. The building process of the system included various
    stages such as production link, processing link, warehouse management link, distribution
    of cold chain link and sales link. The authors compared and analyzed the proposed
    traceability system with the traditional traceability systems using various parameters.
    The authors also discussed the advantages of using the blockchain and RFID technology
    in the proposed system. As stated by the authors, the major advantage was that
    the traceability system totally removed the necessity of the trusted centralized
    agencies and provided a data sharing decentralized platform through which all
    the users could carry out their respective operations with openness, neutrality,
    transparency, security, and reliability. Lin et al. [167] developed a blockchain-based
    traceability system, especially for food supply-chain. It stored the data of every
    node in the food supply-chain and combined all the information using blockchains.
    The authors proposed a conceptual framework for agri-food traceability system
    using Ethereum and blockchain as shown in Fig. 11. In this figure, a user can
    register with the help of the cryptographic keys and can get the information of
    the products stored on BigchainDB. FIGURE 11. A conceptual food traceability systems
    [167]. Show All Storage and management of data performed with the help of BigchainDB.
    All the users in a system such as producers, retailers, distributors, consumers,
    processors, and regulatory could check the information and modify or add the product
    from BigchainDB if they are the authentic users of the system. As per the authors,
    this RFID and blockchain-based model had a few limitations such as it did not
    have any mechanism to ensure whether the raw data collected from sensors was correct,
    whether the data scanned by the RFID tags and barcodes to scan food tracking is
    correct, i.e, anyone can tamper the sensor’s data and the absence of the blockchain
    methods to detect the same. Table 13 provides a detailed relative comparison of
    the existing blockchain-based approaches for the agriculture domain. The parameters
    used for this comparison are transparency, reliability, security, architecture,
    consensus mechanism, traceability system, framework, advantages, and disadvantages
    of the existing approaches. TABLE 13 Agriculture With Blockchain SECTION V. Open
    Issues and Challenges In this section, we highlight the open issues and challenges
    in some application domains such as healthcare, IoT, energy, business, smart city,
    agriculture, energy, and supply-chain & logistics. Fig. 12 gives a detailed taxonomy
    of the open issues in the blockchain applications. FIGURE 12. Taxonomy of open
    issues in Blockchain Applications. Show All A. Blockchain Design and Implementation
    Challenges The future of the blockchain can be decided by its safety, robustness,
    smart contract, database technology, security tokens, and changing regulatory
    environment. However, to achieve the goals, the design and implementation of the
    blockchain need to provide extreme reliability, safety, and scalability which
    rely on major technologies such as shared ledger, consensus, provenance, immutability,
    and smart contract. In this section, we outline the design and implementation
    issues faced by the traditional systems and the possible solutions by the blockchain
    technology, as shown in Fig. 13. FIGURE 13. Design and Implementation issues of
    Blockchain. Show All 1) Centralization One of the major hurdles in the traditional
    system is its centralized mechanism. Such systems are larger, more complex for
    organizations in particular. If the centralized system is getting attacked or
    compromised, all the data can leads to a different direction. In this more network
    delay and higher computing power required, so the cost is more for the server.
    The central authority having all privileges in the system that clears the transactions
    made by the users. It can be eliminated or replaced with the decentralized system,
    in that verification is done by the consensus of the different users in the network.
    2) Scalability Nowadays, we store all the transactions in the decentralized blockchain
    network to validate them. As a result of this, the blockchain becomes heavy and
    slow. There is a restriction on the size of each block and time interval required
    to create a new block. The blockchain can process only 7 to 8 transactions in
    one second, but in real time scenarios, millions of transactions execute and hence
    it is impossible to implement a blockchain for a real-time scenario which imposes
    a challenge of scalability. 3) Establishing Trust In today’s era, how to establish
    the trust is the major problem for everyone because any third party creates major
    issues with the ongoing situation or breaches the data and increases the redundancy
    which makes more difficult to trust anyone. In such scenarios, the blockchain
    can be used to prevent hampering and establishing the trust as it uses the cryptographic
    hash for building the blocks and immutable nature of the ledger. 4) Security Security
    of important data is the major concern in every organization. The security challenges
    include monitoring the cloud configuration, impact of attacks, vulnerability of
    mobile carriers, unauthorized access, and modification of data by intruders. The
    blockchain technology records the transactions using blocks which are linked together
    with the help of the cryptographic keys and immutable ledger and thus, makes it
    very difficult for attackers to modify or delete information or transactions.
    5) Cost Use of different agencies, intermediaries mostly includes various frauds,
    commission charges, and duplication of product. The blockchain eliminates the
    need of a third party and therefore, the transactions can be completed resulting
    in fewer fees [168]. Smart contracts, a component of the blockchain technology
    are self-executing and stored on the blockchains. Due to the decentralized nature
    of the system, no one can control these contracts and therefore each involved
    party can trust their validity. Because of the high level of automation in this
    technology, the companies who have adopted the blockchain technology, have experienced
    huge cost savings. 6) Transparency Different companies have their own policies,
    regulations, and tracking systems. This leads to a poor connection and less visibility
    among the customers and business. The distributed nature of the blockchain transactions
    make them public and verifiable by every user in the network with transparency
    [169]. Table 14 provides the detailed relative comparison of the design and implementation
    challenges associated with the traditional systems and the possible solutions
    by using the blockchain technology. TABLE 14 Design and Implementation Challenges
    of Existing System and Possible Solutions by Blockchain B. Open Challenges in
    Healthcare Table 15 provides a detailed relative comparison of the design and
    implementation challenges in the healthcare domain and the possible solutions
    using blockchains. TABLE 15 Open Challenges in Healthcare 1) Master Patient Indices
    Every year the volume of the healthcare related data increases and often when
    dealing with the healthcare data, records get mismatched or duplicated. Also,
    different electronic health records systems have their own data format and data
    set to enter and execute the data, which raises a need for having a standardized
    data format. Due to the use of blockchain technology, the data are cryptographically
    hashed in the ledger. The user could look for the recorded transactions which
    can have multiple records or the keys, but with the use of the blockchain technology,
    all information is linked with single patient Ids. 2) Patient Data Management
    The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act is known as (HIPAA) controls
    the patients’ data privacy and makes the data PHI secured, but the patients need
    to give their medical data to the third parties such as pharmacists, imposing
    the need of protecting the data. With the use of the blockchain, a hash for each
    patient’s health information in blocks which contains the patient ids is created.
    Using the blockchain network API, the disease-related data can be viewed with
    respect to the affected patient without revealing the patient’s personal information.
    In the same manner, a patient can have the privilege to decide who can view or
    access his data with a specific third party [170]. 3) Data Provenance and Integrity
    Patients’ health information, electronic health records, data collected from IoT,
    and monitoring systems are maintained by the medical facilities. Here, the main
    target is to secure the information and its sharing techniques, authorize healthcare
    facilities and its entities to confirm the correct information and ensure the
    proper services. The blockchain is more useful in such scenarios because of its
    ability to provide data integrity. The approach of the blockchain is to share
    and distribute data publicly with the secured transactions. The technique used
    by this technology is PoW with time stamping. 4) Clinical Trials Researchers working
    in various domains always want their confidential information to be stored privately
    and securely so that no unauthorized person can breach or modify or steal their
    data. In the blockchain technology, data modification is impossible with the SHA256
    algorithm that creates the unique hash values which are linked together into a
    chain. The healthcare industry needs to maintain and share the information related
    to clinical trials securely which can only be shared with authorized parties such
    as research sponsors or regulatory committees. With the blockchains, the data
    can be managed or traced with consent within multiple sites, protocols, and systems.
    Patients having proper access privileges can also access this information regarding
    their health issues and related research. 5) Drug Traceability Currently, the
    main hurdle in pharmacology is the drug counterfeiting. By the survey of the health
    researchers, it has been observed that about 10 to 30 percentage of the drugs
    in the developing countries are duplicate. The adverse effect of this is the loss
    of business and improper usage of fake drugs which can lead to severe damages
    to a person’s health. The use of the blockchain network across the drug facilities
    can detect frauds from the drug dealer. All the operations from the manufactures
    to the suppliers are contained in the blockchain network that enables to trace
    the whole route of drugs. 6) Data Enrichment Storing unstructured data can lead
    to variability, time consumption in the search process, the lack of reliability.
    Data enrichment is an operation for adding values to increase quality. Health
    records must be structured, secured, accurate, time-stamped, and easy to read.
    Following steps are required to be executed to organize the data before adding
    it to the blockchain: Replacing the patient’s identity with the public hash key,
    making it compliance-ready, adding meta information and structuring it for computation.
    Organized data enables all healthcare providers to access the data efficiently.
    C. Open Challenges in Internet of Things Table 16 provides the detailed relative
    comparison of the design and implementation challenges in the IoT and possible
    solutions by using blockchains. TABLE 16 Open Challenges in IoT 1) Architecture
    IoT ecosystems depend upon the centralized network in which all the devices are
    connected in a client-server model through the brokered communication. It uses
    the cloud server to authenticate and identify devices. It needs higher processing
    time, computation power and bandwidth. The blockchain decentralized architecture
    creates a P2P network through which messaging, file sharing and device coordination
    becomes easier. 2) Sensors’ Maintaining Issues With the increase in the number
    of devices used in IoT each year, it becomes a very problematic and challenging
    task for the manufacturers or service provides to maintain these devices on a
    daily basis. Moreover, this is a time consuming and high maintenance cost task.
    The use of blockchain technology in this domain can reduce the cost as well as
    time. 3) Centralized Databases A centralized database has a restricted computing
    power and storage capacity. There is always a large number of nodes to connect
    to the server which is a time-consuming task. It is also difficult to find faulty
    nodes in this structure. Most of the IoT devices connect with the centralized
    database and cloud network which increases the cost and computational requirements.
    In the distributed blockchain technology, nodes have minimum connectivity and
    still, the network remains reliable and safe. With distributed computing, the
    utilization of available computing power is increased for billions of transactions
    irrespective of the location of the devices. This makes the IoT more reliable
    and cost-effective. 4) Data Privacy and Security Issues If the users’ data are
    stored in a centralized database then privacy & security becomes the major concern.
    Nowadays, to earn profit, various companies store, use and sell user’s data to
    third parties without the consent of the users. Such actions compromise the privacy
    of users’ data. The blockchain technology uses a distributed database structure
    which stores data in the encrypted form and thus reduces the risk of data stealing
    and breach of privacy. 5) Device Legal Identificatin In the current era, sensor
    devices used in the IoT applications are small in size and have limited computing
    and storage capacity. Hence, such devices are vulnerable to physical attacks such
    as impersonation or spoofing. The blockchain technology uses smart contracts and
    consensus mechanism which boost the proper identity verification of the IoT nodes,
    and eliminates the unauthorized access of the active devices by unknown users.
    D. Open Challenges in Business 1) Data Privacy In today’s era, data privacy is
    one of the key challenges in the business domain, where many systems encounter
    data breaches, leak of personal information, unauthorized monitoring and eavesdropping,
    breach of access control rights, data stealing and leaking. With the distributed
    blockchain technology, data are stored in an immutable manner having secured time-stamping,
    public audit and consensus, making the system robust against privacy issues. 2)
    Backup and Disaster Recovery Storage and backup of data are very important in
    any business application. For storing and maintaining large a volume of data,
    more computing power is needed which results in the increase of the overall cost.
    Moreover, if data is maintained on a centralized system, the risk of a single
    point of failure also increases. The blockchain mechanism uses decentralized systems
    for the distributed handling of data. A clustered hierarchy is used for data storage
    and backup that eliminates the probability of losing the data. 3) Smart Contracts
    The process of contracting includes bidding, validation, and approval for enabling
    the next steps. Execution of a traditional contract may require human intervention
    which makes the involvement of a third party as a service. The same is required
    even during disputes and leads to take higher time for resources consumption,
    and the high cost of the contract. Using blockchains, smart automation is created
    without human intervention, which eliminates the involvement of third party transactions
    and unnecessary time delays. 4) Letter of Credit (LC) Payment An international
    letter of credit payment requires a purchaser and dealer and they use paper-based
    letter of credits to make transactions. In this scenario, each party needs to
    send the necessary documents via post or courier services. Due to requirement,
    time and cost involved in the process are much higher and not convenient for the
    exporters. If used in this domain, the blockchain technology has the potential
    to eliminate the time delay by providing cost-effective faster services. The blockchain
    makes the transactions transparent and integrated with the electronic bill of
    the ledger. Table 17 provides a detailed relative comparison of the design and
    implementation challenges for business applications and possible solutions by
    using blockchains. TABLE 17 Open Challenges in Business E. Open Challenges in
    Smart City Table 18 provides a detailed relative comparison of the design and
    implementation challenges in the smart city domain and the possible solutions
    with the blockchain technology. TABLE 18 Open Challenges in Smart City 1) Digital
    Identity In the current era, online services need users or clients to provide
    personal identification information before availing the services. All these data
    are stored without the knowledge of the owners and can be accessed by third parties.
    When the decentralized blockchain technology is used to implement online services,
    digital ids are created for all the users. These ids along with digital watermarking
    techniques are used while executing user transactions. This is how users’ data
    can be stored, maintained and controlled in the permissioned network having access
    rights only with the individual users. 2) Transportation Management The transportation
    business is very popular these days to provide routine services to a large number
    of customers. Providing necessary services to the customers is quite costly. The
    involvement of third parties in providing services may lead to the breach of privacy
    of users’ personal data as well as an increase in the cost of availing services.
    A decentralized blockchain network can handle all these issues effectively and
    efficiently by enabling a P2P platform for transportation services. 3) Education
    In today’s world, education institutes either private or public, do not provide
    the exact records to the government. That is why the government cannot check or
    help for literacy targets. With the inclusion of blockchain technology, educational
    records can be made available via an automated consent mechanism. This solution
    makes the information redundant and the same can be integrated with the government
    population registry so that it can handle all the literacy targets in country’s
    population. 4) Land Use Traditional registration of land or property is a very
    time consuming and costly process. The blockchain technology can eliminate the
    hurdles associated with this conventional process by creating a digital process
    of automated property registration. This solution increases the transparency and
    trust within the system and improves the economy. The newer development of smart
    cities combines the blockchain based technology for a number of processes such
    as land and property registry, getting approvals, generating inspection reports
    and recording the certificates. F. Open Challanges in Agriculture Table 19 provides
    the detailed relative comparison of the design and implementation challenges in
    the agriculture domain and the possible solutions using blockchains. TABLE 19
    Open Challenges in Agriculture 1) Outdated Record-Keeping In agriculture, all
    the information regarding foods, farmers, seller-buyer information are very outdated
    and not available to all the users. So, its very difficult to process the data
    and conduct market analysis. With the usage of blockchain network all the participants
    have the access of all record and transactions in trustworthy and secure manner.
    2) Traceability / Transparency The second open challenge in agriculture is traceability,
    which focus on the origin of the foods and its quality. But, its very difficult
    to find original and genuine products or foods in supply chain. Blockchain based
    sensor tracking system is a viable possible solution to eliminate the aforementioned
    issue. 3) Transaction Cost and Market Access Some times small scale farmers are
    not getting the whole market access in agriculture. Thus, the farmers compromised
    with higher cost with limited access to the market. With the help of distributed
    ledger technology of blockchain network, all the data are available and easily
    access to the every market on the network, which helps the all the farmers to
    connects with market and also to built trust. G. Open Challenges in Energy Table
    20 provides the detailed relative comparison of the design and implementation
    challenges in the energy domain and the possible solutions based on the blockchains.
    TABLE 20 Open Challenges in Energy 1) Energy and Environment In today’s scenario,
    we don’t have a smart grid like infrastructure, and the use of the normal infrastructures
    makes the third party intermediary problems such as VAT frauds, security issues,
    high cost, and carbon emission which can lead the environment to a very worse
    condition. With the use of blockchain technology, the development of the smart
    grid energy infrastructure is possible through which each customer can get emission
    allowance criteria for the safety of the environment. All kind of tracking and
    monitoring of energy makes it easier to build and sustain a healthy and green
    environment on the earth. 2) Inequality In the current scenario, retailers don’t
    have the grid infrastructure. So, the energy providers enable middlemen to monitor
    the electric meters and put extra burden on the customers to cover the cost of
    the middlemen and earn high profits. The blockchain technology helps to eliminate
    the middlemen energy retailers so that the consumers can trade the energy and
    also buy it, directly from the smart grid. It has been observed that the consumers
    can reduce the energy bill by 38%. 3) Peer-to-Peer Trading Energy trading has
    involved intermediaries or brokers so far. They charge their fees for every trading
    process and act as a link between energy generators and consumers. Energy trading
    takes place at the power exchanges and over the counters. The blockchain P2P network
    created in the smart grid infrastructure helps directly exchange the energy to
    one another without involving brokers and paying them unnecessary costs. The overall
    process becomes cost-effective and easy for customers. 4) Energy Meters Currently,
    the use on energy meters creates dependency on middlemen monitoring. It also increases
    the amount of billing and makes the overall process tedious. Smart meters can
    be used for quick implementation of the process and monitor the correct energy
    usage. This eliminates the dependency of meter monitoring by middlemen at a great
    extent. The users can avail the required load and power with the use of blockchain-based
    microgrids energy. H. Open Challenges in Supply-Chain & Logistics 1) Counterfeiting
    In today’s world, every industry has issues of counterfeiting of products and
    drugs. This creates issues like poor customer satisfaction with quality, unverifiable
    products or fake products. All these make the overall trust and reputation of
    companies or manufactures to go down. The blockchain technology lessens the distance
    between customers and companies and makes the processes more transparent. It stores
    tamper proof tracking history of the products which makes it difficult to counterfeit
    the products. 2) Authenticity In today’s world, users rely on the documents to
    check products’ or services’ validity and originality. But such documents can
    easily be tempered. The blockchain technology provides a secure way to maintain
    the information about the supply chain to avoid any kind of modification or breaching
    of data. This technology enables the clients and suppliers to trace the origin
    as well as movements of the products. With the use of RFID tags attached to the
    vehicles, it becomes possible to trace the products along with timestamps. 3)
    Provenance Tracking Every industry and company has dependencies on the supply
    chains. It is very difficult to track every record in transit even in multinational
    companies. The need for transparency leads to the increased cost and clients’
    relational issues which can weaken the brand or company value. A blockchain-based
    supply chain can maintain all the necessary records and their tracking details
    easily with the help of the embedded sensors. This kind of precise tracking can
    help to identify any fraud that occurs anywhere in the supply-chain. 4) Inefficiency
    Although contemporary supply-chains can handle the complexities of manufacturing
    processes, they are still extremely slow, expensive, and inefficient. When each
    supplier and manufacturer have their own infrastructure, tracking products in
    real time is difficult in a fragmented system. Product delivery delays are usually
    caused by the lack of access to up-to-date data. This can be mitigated using the
    blockchain technology, which increases the supply-chain efficiency while speeding
    up the time to market. Table 21 provides the detailed relative comparison of the
    design and implementation challenges in the supply chain and logistics and the
    possible solutions based on the blockchain. TABLE 21 Open Challenges in Supply-Chain
    & Logistics SECTION VI. Case Studies In order to demonstrate the use of blockchains,
    we have tried to implement the blockchain technology for two different applications:
    smart farming and tourism & hospitality. The blockchain is one of the greatest
    inventions of this decade and it has taken the whole world by a storm. Nowadays,
    the blockchain has become a popular technology due to its properties such as decentralization,
    improved security, replication, irreversibility, time-stamping and cryptography.
    In this paper, we have discussed the use of the blockchain technology for a variety
    of applications such as smart farming, smart healthcare, supply chain & logistics,
    energy sector, IoT, smart city, business, manufacturing, agriculture, and tourism
    & hospitality. We have also discussed various open issues and challenges associated
    with different applications. A. Smart Farming In this case study, we provide insights
    into the current issues associated with smart farming and how they can be resolved
    by implementing the blockchain mechanism. Here, we present blockchain-based smart
    farming and mentioned role & functionality of different users in smart farming.
    In smart farming, various issues related to food safety, food integrity, transaction
    cost, and food traceability need to be considered. Extensive use of fertilizers
    and pesticides on agricultural products is the major concern in food safety. Pesticides
    and fertilizers residues on various agricultural products have drawn the attention
    of many countries. [165]. This has leveraged the demand for safe agricultural
    products in the market. To handle this demand, we need a perfect tracing and management
    system for ensuring food safety during each process of production and supply [166].
    All these issues in smart farming can be handled with the help of the proposed
    architecture shown in Fig. 14. In this architecture, different stakeholders such
    as farmers, crop insurance agencies, feed manufacturers, food producers, food
    manufacturers, retailers, and consumers are considered. Farmers have various functionalities
    such as farm management through the analysis of soil/crop health, crop-livestock
    management through agricultural robots, financial services management based on
    the entities like transaction costs, the safety of crops by sensors and insurance
    agencies. Feed manufacturers take the raw data from the oil-seed-crusher and mineral
    suppliers. They provide inputs to the food processor, through which the food is
    manufactured, and then sent to the customer across the chain of the food distributors
    & retailers. To maintain the food safety, transparency & food traceability and
    minimum transaction cost, our proposed blockchain-based architecture uses a distributed
    network which establishes and maintains all the transactions in a secured manner.
    FIGURE 14. A blockchain based smart farming. Show All B. Tourism & Hospitality
    In this case study, we highlight the current issues in the tourism industry and
    show how they can be resolved by implementing the blockchain mechanism. We present
    a case study that follows the process model shown in Fig. 15 Recently, many tourism
    companies like Expedia Group, BCD Travel, Uber, Ola, and AirBnb have replaced
    their conventional business models by C2C models to achieve transparency and security
    in transactions. There is a huge demand for innovative platforms in the tourism
    industry to integrate technology, money, and knowledge. There are many companies
    like TUI which has already started using blockchains for ticket booking transactions.
    Many companies like Expedia, CheapAir, Webjet, and One Shot Hotels have started
    using bitcoins for their transactions. Digital currencies simply integrate with
    the smart contracts which have enough potential to develop highly disruptive technologies
    for the tourism industry. Generally, customers take the help of online reviews
    of different tourism products to make a decision. They think that all the reviews
    of real travelers are honest and true, but actually, most of the tourism & hospitality
    industry players, (i.e. Hotels, Travel agencies, or restaurants) use centralized
    platforms to store and maintain these reviews. Through such centralized storage
    platforms, user reviews can be manipulated and modified very easily by different
    agencies for their own profit. FIGURE 15. A blockchain based tourism framework
    Show All There is a frequent involvement in the exchange of money in the tourism
    industry across the country to another party where they do not have any past business
    relationship. For such exchanges, customers generally take the help of the trusted
    third parties. Every time, a trusted third party tries to maintain a secured exchange
    of money. For providing this service, the trusted third party takes a commission.
    The need of involving third parties in the transactions can be avoided by the
    inclusion of cryptocurrencies in the blockchain technology for the exchange of
    money. We can create a new platform for C2C transactions in markets for tourism
    products. So, in our case study, we have suggested the use of a blockchain-based
    decentralized online customer review system to resolve the above issues. All the
    current issues in the tourism industry could be resolved with the help of our
    proposed architecture. In this architecture, users, travel agencies and hotels
    are the different categories of tourism industry users. Here, we use the blockchain
    decentralized network and cryptocurrencies through which the users can book tickets.
    Thus, the trusted third parties and commission charges by them can be avoided.
    All the transactions are maintained through blocks with unique identities which
    eliminates the creation of duplicate or fake online reviews. SECTION VII. Conclusion
    In this paper, we provide insights to the readers about the importance of the
    blockchain technology for various smart applications, where security remains paramount.
    This survey is divided into five parts. The first part discusses the traditional
    security systems, background, and history of the blockchains. The second part
    describes the basic architecture of the blockchain technology, including the verification
    of each transaction in the distributed network which makes a permanent, verified
    and unalterable nature of ledger for the information or data. Moreover, the blockchain
    reference architecture which consists of three different networks such as public
    network, cloud network and enterprise network. The Third part of our paper focuses
    on the real-time deployment of the blockchain for various applications such as
    smart healthcare, smart farming, supply-chain & logistics, business, tourism&
    hospitality, energy, agriculture, digital content distribution, smart city, IoT,
    and manufacturing which are also considered in the survey part of the paper. The
    fourth part emphasizes on the open issues and challenges in Industry 4.0-based
    smart applications and suggests some blockchain based solutions for those applications.
    Finally, to demonstrate the suitability of the blockchain technology for smart
    applications, the last part of our paper illustrates case studies on two application
    domains: smart farming, and tourism & hospitality. We plan to explore the feasibility
    of developing a blockchain-based infrastructure for precision agriculture in future.

    \ The current\nfocus on producing zero-carbon buildings, emphasises reducing OC\
    \ and ignores the importance of\nreducing EC emissions. This study focuses on\
    \ EC. Methods available in EC estimating currently\nproduce estimates that often\

    \ system\n1. Introduction\nBlockchain, being an emerging technology that resulted\
    \ through Industry 4.0, has drawn\nconsiderable interest from various start-ups,\
    \ technology developers, enterprises, national governments,\nand the academic\
    \ community [1]. Manglekar and Dinesha [2] identiﬁed blockchain as a distributed,\n\
    decentralised ledger that stores all transactions.\nIn addition, it provides a\
    \ distributed shared\ndatabase and a computational infrastructure, which prevents\
    \ the tampering and revision of data [3].\nBefore approving a transaction, blockchain\
    \ performs an autonomous veriﬁcation through the\nconsensus algorithms to ensure\
    \ security, prevent false transactions being recorded, and avoid double\nspending\
    \ [4]. It was originally designed as a decentralised network for exchanging digital\
    \ money.\nBlockchain technology is not only used for the transfer of digital money,\
    \ but lately it has been\nBuildings 2020, 10, 140; doi:10.3390/buildings10080140\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/buildings\nBuildings 2020, 10, 140\n2 of 13\nadopted for\
    \ various other applications. According to Walport [5], blockchain as a technology\
    \ has\nthe capacity to deliver a new kind of trust to a wide range of services\
    \ while revolutionising the\nindustries to reform ﬁnancial markets, supply chains,\
    \ consumer and business-to-business services,\nand publicly-held registers.\n\
    Blockchain technology can be applied to many areas of the construction industry\
    \ including\nConstruction Supply Chains (CSCs), building information modelling,\
    \ design management,\nsustainability and waste management, property and land titles,\
    \ asset management, and maintenance\namong others [6–10]. However, construction\
    \ industry is having diﬃculties embracing digitalisation\ndue to various reasons\
    \ such as fragmentation, lack of replication, transience, and decentralisation\n\
    among others [11]. According to Perera, et al. [10] and Agarwal, et al. [12],\
    \ the construction industry\nis the second least digitalised industry, which had\
    \ just managed to surpass the lowest digitalised\nindustry, agriculture. It is\
    \ predominantly important to adapt innovative technologies to improve\nproductivity\
    \ and performance in construction. Embodied Carbon (EC) estimating in CSCs using\n\
    blockchain has been identiﬁed as a credible application of blockchain [13]. This\
    \ study explores the\nimportance of using a blockchain system compared to a traditional\
    \ system to estimate EC in CSCs.\nInitially, the paper discusses fundamental principles\
    \ on blockchain highlighting layers of blockchain\narchitecture, followed by discussing\
    \ the importance of carbon estimating and current issues in carbon\nestimating.\
    \ Subsequently, an elaborated analysis was carried out to explore the suitability\
    \ of using a\nblockchain system to estimate EC rather than using a traditional\
    \ information system, by considering the\nsalient features of blockchain such\
    \ as decentralisation, anonymity, security, immutability, and so forth.\nA traditional\
    \ information system is “a system in which human participants and/or machines\
    \ carry\nout processes using information, technology, and other resources to produce\
    \ informational products\nand/or services for internal or external customers”\
    \ [14] (p. 451). For example, diﬀerent databases\nand IT-based tools used for\
    \ estimating EC are classiﬁed as traditional information systems in this\nresearch.\
    \ Blockchain is a new technology that has added features and, therefore, is distinguished\
    \ from\nthe traditional information systems.\n1.1. Blockchain\nA blockchain is\
    \ a shared and distributed database that contains a continuously expanding log\n\
    of transactions that is stored according to a chronological order [1]. Blockchain\
    \ is a decentralised\ntransaction ledger that acts as part of a large computing\
    \ architecture, which includes many other\nfunctions related to storage, communication,\
    \ ﬁle serving, and archives [15]. According to Li [16] (p. 278),\n“blockchain\
    \ is an integrated technology, which includes Hash, asymmetric encryption, workload\
    \ proof,\nMerkel tree, timestamp, and peer-to-peer network are not new technologies,\
    \ but with new ideas to\ncombine them cleverly”. The security and accuracy of\
    \ the data stored in the ledger are maintained\ncryptographically through the\
    \ use of public and private keys, and signatures to control “who can do\nwhat”\
    \ within the shared ledger [5].\nBlockchain architecture consists of four main\
    \ layers: the application layer, contract layer, consensus\nlayer, and network\
    \ layer as illustrated in Figure 1. The network layer is the lowest level, which\
    \ generates,\nvalidates, and stores the data and information in the blockchain\
    \ [17]. The peer-to-peer network consists\nof multiple nodes that could act as\
    \ public (permission-less), private (permissioned), or a consortium,\nbased on\
    \ the arrangement and limitations of access to data. The consensus and contract\
    \ layers act\nas the intermediary level between lower and upper levels. The consensus\
    \ layer contains protocols\nthat contribute to appending a block to the blockchain\
    \ [18]. There are several consensus mechanisms\navailable, such as proof of work,\
    \ proof of stake, delegated proof of stake, and proof of importance\namong others,\
    \ which have been used in various blockchain platforms considering the requirements\
    \ of\nthe platform and characteristics of the consensus mechanism. Though the\
    \ consensus mechanism, proof\nof work consumes massive amount of energy, other\
    \ consensus mechanisms such as proof of stake,\ndelegated proof of stake among\
    \ others are comparatively energy eﬃcient. Therefore, it is recommended\nthat\
    \ energy eﬃciency be considered for selecting the blockchain platform. The contract\
    \ layer includes\nBuildings 2020, 10, 140\n3 of 13\nsmart contracts and incentive\
    \ mechanism that enables ﬂexible programming and operational data\nfunctions for\
    \ the blockchain system [17]. The application layer contains classes of the blockchain\n\
    applications [18] related to various sectors, for example, ﬁnance (cryptocurrencies\
    \ and FinTechs),\nsupply chain management [19], energy trading, and asset management\
    \ among others.\nBuildings 2020, 10, x FOR PEER REVIEW \n3 of 13 \nvarious sectors,\
    \ for example, finance (cryptocurrencies and FinTechs), supply chain management\
    \ \n[19], energy trading, and asset management among others. \nApplication Layer\n\
    Consensus Layer\nNetwork Layer\nContract Layer\n \nFigure 1. Layers of blockchain\
    \ architecture. Adapted from Dinh, et al. [18] and Lu [17]. \nInitially Blockchain\
    \ 1.0 was introduced to securely validate and store information of \ntransactions,\
    \ which was populated as cryptocurrencies [20]. Subsequently Swan [15] identified\
    \ the \nusage of Blockchain 2.0 for economic, market and financial applications\
    \ such as stocks, bonds, smart \nproperty, and smart contracts, whereas Blockchain\
    \ 3.0 was used for applications beyond currency, \nfinance, and markets, particularly\
    \ related to the government, health, science, and art among others. \nBlockchain\
    \ has the potential to be considered for various energy related applications such\
    \ as energy \ntrading [1], energy management, carbon trading [13], and carbon\
    \ offsets among others. Similarly, a \ndecentralised accounting process used in\
    \ blockchains, can be applied for the purpose of accounting \nEC in CSCs of projects.\
    \ \n1.2. Embodied Carbon Estimating \nCarbon emissions can occur as Operational\
    \ Carbon (OC) and EC emissions. OC refers to carbon \nemissions that occur during\
    \ the operational phase of a building [21], while EC emissions occur during \n\
    the production process of a product/service [22]. The novel trend of reducing\
    \ OC in typical projects \nto deliver more energy efficient buildings known as\
    \ zero-carbon projects, has led to the remaining \nEC component to becoming almost\
    \ 100%. As a result, estimating and reducing EC emissions of \nbuildings has become\
    \ an increasingly vital topic internationally and domestically. EC estimating\
    \ can \nbe carried out using various tools such as the CapIT estimator, Building\
    \ Research Establishment \n(BRE) calculator, Carbon Footprint Calculator for Construction\
    \ Projects (CFCCP), French \nDevelopment Agency (AFD) tool, GaBi software, SimaPro,\
    \ eToolLCD, Embodied Carbon Explorer \n(ECE) tool, The Footprint Calculator and\
    \ databases such as Inventory of Carbon and Energy (ICE), \nBlackbook, Waste Reduction\
    \ Action Plan (WRAP), Ecoinvent, Australian Life Cycle Inventory \n(AusLCI), Environmental\
    \ Performance in Construction (EPiC), and The GreenBook 2010 among \nothers [23],\
    \ whereas a summary of these EC estimating tools and databases has been illustrated\
    \ in \nTable 1. \nFigure 1. Layers of blockchain architecture. Adapted from Dinh,\
    \ et al. [18] and Lu [17].\nInitially Blockchain 1.0 was introduced to securely\
    \ validate and store information of transactions,\nwhich was populated as cryptocurrencies\
    \ [20]. Subsequently Swan [15] identified the usage of Blockchain\n2.0 for economic,\
    \ market and financial applications such as stocks, bonds, smart property, and\
    \ smart\ncontracts, whereas Blockchain 3.0 was used for applications beyond currency,\
    \ finance, and markets,\nparticularly related to the government, health, science,\
    \ and art among others. Blockchain has the potential\nto be considered for various\
    \ energy related applications such as energy trading [1], energy management,\n\
    carbon trading [13], and carbon offsets among others. Similarly, a decentralised\
    \ accounting process used\nin blockchains, can be applied for the purpose of accounting\
    \ EC in CSCs of projects.\n1.2. Embodied Carbon Estimating\nCarbon emissions can\
    \ occur as Operational Carbon (OC) and EC emissions. OC refers to carbon\nemissions\
    \ that occur during the operational phase of a building [21], while EC emissions\
    \ occur during\nthe production process of a product/service [22]. The novel trend\

    \ being considered in the tender selection process in the UK and\ninternationally,\
    \ due to the evident identiﬁcation on the importance of reducing the EC component\
    \ in\nthe construction industry [45,46]. However, Sinha, et al. [47] found that\
    \ when estimating carbon using\nthe tools, GaBi and SimaPro, even after using\
    \ same materials, similar origins and similar technology,\nthe models had produced\
    \ diﬀerent results as the considered assumptions, boundaries among others,\nvary\
    \ dependent on the estimator.\nSimilarly, Elhag [45] declared that in carbon accounting\
    \ and\nmeasurement many inaccuracies exist due to the issues associated with scope,\
    \ data representativeness,\ntendency to use generic data and so forth. In addition\
    \ to that, Rodrigo, et al. [23] identiﬁed many\nother issues in the current EC\
    \ estimating databases and tools, for example, usage of diﬀerent system\nboundaries,\
    \ diﬀerent geographical locations, lack of standardisation, lack of data on new\
    \ products,\nincomplete data, assumptions, and lack of transparency. Subsequently,\
    \ the authors introduced a new\nmethodology for estimating EC in CSCs using the\
    \ value chain concept and blockchain technology that\ncould eliminate these identiﬁed\
    \ issues. As the next step, this paper investigates the importance of\nusing a\
    \ blockchain system to estimate EC instead of a traditional information system.\n\
    2. Research Methodology\nThe aim of this study was to explore the potential application\
    \ of using a blockchain system in\nestimating EC in CSCs by comparing and contrasting\
    \ the salient features of blockchain technology\nagainst a traditional information\
    \ system. Initially a traditional literature review was carried out to\nidentify\
    \ the fundamentals and salient features of blockchain, followed by three expert\
    \ interviews\nto obtain experts’ opinions and validate the literature ﬁndings\
    \ while investigating the possibility of\nusing blockchain for estimating EC.\
    \ All experts were senior consultants who had more than 13 years\nof experience\
    \ in Information Technology (IT) and more than 4 years of experience in distributed\n\
    systems and blockchain technology, especially on smart contract development and\
    \ deployment. Due to\nthe limited number of expert interviews that were carried\
    \ out, the ﬁndings of the study cannot be\ngeneralised. However, as blockchain\
    \ is an emerging technology that was introduced only in 2008\nand further due\
    \ to limitations of the study, especially related to time constraints, knowledge\
    \ and\nexperience of experts in blockchain among others, these experts were selected\
    \ through convenience\nsampling and data was collected through semi-structured\
    \ interviews. In order to reduce biasness in\nthese interviews, interviewees were\
    \ given the freedom to respond on traditional information systems\nvs. blockchain\
    \ systems based on its features without discussing the literature ﬁndings in advance.\n\
    Subsequently, the literature ﬁndings were provided and veriﬁed whether their responses\
    \ would change.\nThe ﬁndings of the literature review and expert interviews have\
    \ been discussed in the following section.\n3. Research Findings and Discussion\n\
    The detailed literature review carried out assisted in identifying the salient\
    \ features of blockchain;\ndecentralisation, anonymity, security, immutability,\
    \ auditability, veracity, transparency, disintermediation,\ntrust, and scalability\
    \ (See Table 2). There was lack of research work that had carried out a comprehensive\n\
    comparison between the salient features of a blockchain system against a traditional\
    \ information system.\nTherefore, the researcher carried out a comparison between\
    \ a traditional information system and a\nblockchain system over the pros and\
    \ cons to decide on the suitability of blockchain to be used for EC\nestimating\
    \ as depicted in the last two columns in Table 2. The comparison was carried out\
    \ as a qualitative\nstudy based on available literature sources; as a result,\
    \ the terminology, no, low, medium, and high\nwere used to compare the salient\
    \ features. These findings were validated through expert interviews as\ndiscussed\
    \ in the latter part of this section.\nThe overall summary of Table 2 reveals\
    \ that though blockchain supports most of the features\nlisted, traditional information\
    \ systems would either not accommodate most of them or else would be\naccommodating\
    \ in a comparatively lesser portion. An EC estimating system requires one to produce\n\
    an accurate EC estimate (accuracy), secure EC data ensuring that data is not tampered\
    \ with (security),\na transparent EC estimating method which shows the EC contributors\
    \ and the supply chains without\nBuildings 2020, 10, 140\n6 of 13\nrevealing conﬁdential\
    \ data (transparency), remove the involvement of a third party to estimate EC\n\
    (disintermediation), and so forth. Hence, at a glance, a blockchain system is\
    \ ideal for EC estimating.\nIn addition, all experts agreed with the ﬁndings of\
    \ Table 2 and highlighted that compared to a traditional\nsystem, a blockchain\
    \ system is more suitable to estimate EC in CSCs. However, for further clariﬁcation,\n\
    each feature was considered, and experts’ opinions were obtained to understand\
    \ which system is most\nsuitable for carbon estimating in CSCs.\nTable 2. Comparison\

    \ traditional information system consists of a centralised approach where\neverything\
    \ is controlled by a single point along with a central database that stores the\
    \ data [54].\nAccording to Tan, et al. [55], single point of contact provides\
    \ eﬀective management of services.\nHowever, interviewees B and C opined that\
    \ a traditional information system being centralised,\narises few disadvantages,\
    \ such as increased dependence, open to vulnerability, low auditability,\ntrust\
    \ issues, etc. In order to mitigate such issues while providing the same beneﬁts\
    \ of a centralised\nsystem, decentralised blockchain technology has been introduced\
    \ [56]. In an EC estimating\nblockchain system, a distributed ledger that contains\
    \ all the EC transaction records are shared\namong all the nodes in a peer-to-peer\
    \ network. In order to record a new EC transaction or supersede\nan existing EC\
    \ transaction record stored in a distributed ledger to make a change, generally\
    \ the\nconsent/validation by majority of the nodes is required. Hence, the peer-to-peer\
    \ network makes it\nextremely diﬃcult to tamper with data stored in a blockchain.\
    \ The decentralisation feature of\nblockchain provides a tamper-proof data storage\
    \ mechanism fulﬁlling one of the utmost essential\nfeatures that is required to\
    \ use blockchain for EC estimating in CSCs.\n2.\nAnonymity—A centralised system\
    \ as well as a blockchain system can maintain anonymity;\nhowever, the anonymity\
    \ level in a blockchain is quite high. A blockchain system protects\nthe identity\
    \ of the user by maintaining anonymity or pseudonymity. In order to carry out\n\
    transactions in a blockchain based EC estimating system, each user will have a\
    \ public key and\na private key, which comprise of large integer numbers, but\
    \ since these numbers are so large,\nthey are usually represented using a separate\
    \ Wallet Import Format (WIF) consisting of letters\nand numbers [57]. Neither\
    \ the private key nor the public key discloses the identity of the user\nby any\
    \ means. The user of an EC estimating blockchain system can use his public key\
    \ to prove\nhis identity, thus, blockchain enables pseudonymity eﬀectively. Moreover,\
    \ interviewee A added,\n“unlike a traditional information system that could be\
    \ hacked to reveal the encrypted information\nwhere anonymity can be at stake,\
    \ a blockchain system is considered as almost impossible to\nhack as the public\
    \ key is too complicated for a hacker to decrypt and recover the user details”.\n\
    In EC estimating, it is quite important to maintain anonymity of the EC contributors\
    \ as well as\nother conﬁdential information. Hence, a blockchain system is more\
    \ suitable for recording\nEC transactions.\nBuildings 2020, 10, 140\n7 of 13\n\
    3.\nSecurity—The centralised system as well as a blockchain system maintains security\
    \ through\nauthentication limitations to control users’ access to the systems;\
    \ however, comparatively,\na blockchain system has a higher level of security.\
    \ According to Heeks [58] (p. 10), “centralised\ninformation systems make organisations\
    \ more dependent and more vulnerable for a number of\nreasons such as greater\
    \ numbers of staﬀ relying on single information systems; greater reliance\non\
    \ a few key staﬀ who plan, develop and run those systems; greater technical complexity\
    \ that\nmakes problems harder to diagnose; and greater potential impact of data\
    \ security breaches”. In a\ncentralised system there is a possibility to be hacked\
    \ and as the system is centralised, a change\nin one location is suﬃcient to aﬀect\
    \ the entire system. However, in a blockchain, data is stored\nin cryptographically-linked\
    \ blocks as a ledger and a copy of the ledger is shared among all the\nnodes.\
    \ Therefore, for a hacker to change the data stored in a blockchain system, the\
    \ respective\nhash of that block needs to be changed. Subsequently, the hacker\
    \ has to change the hashes\nin the entire chain between the tampered block and\
    \ the latest block [59]. On the other hand,\nmore than 50% of the ledgers need\
    \ to be replicated within a short period of time for a successful\nattack to be\
    \ completed, which is extremely diﬃcult. According to interviewee A’s point of\n\
    view, “security demarcates the combination of conﬁdentiality, integrity, and availability”.\
    \ In a\nblockchain-based EC estimating system, due to decentralisation, the conﬁdentiality\
    \ of data is at\nstake. However, as EC data are not extremely sensitive or conﬁdential,\
    \ this does not hinder the\ntendency of using blockchain for EC estimating. Data\
    \ integrity also plays an important role and\nit can be achieved easily through\
    \ blockchain due to immutability and decentralisation. EC data\nhas to be available\
    \ and accessible to the respective stakeholders involved in a project and data\n\
    can be easily accessed due to transparency and due to the distributed ledger being\
    \ shared with\nall nodes. Depending on the requirements of the system, the access\
    \ can be controlled through\nauthentication; however, for anyone who has access\
    \ to the system, the EC data will be available\nat his/her ﬁngertip. Interviewee\
    \ B emphasised that “data integrity and availability of information\nwhenever\
    \ required, is essential for a blockchain-based EC estimating system”. In summary,\n\
    though conﬁdentiality is less in a decentralised distributed ledger platform,\
    \ data integrity and\navailability could be achieved well in a blockchain system.\
    \ Hence, a blockchain system has more\nsecurity compared to a traditional information\
    \ system, making it a better option for EC estimating\nin CSCs.\n4.\nImmutability—A\
    \ centralised system is quite vulnerable due to its single point of control [58].\n\
    Hence, if the centralised database is hacked, data can be tampered quite easily\
    \ aﬀecting the\nentire system. Additionally, interviewee A stated that “in a centralised\
    \ system, data life is totally\ndepending on a single organisation who is mainlining\
    \ the system. However, in a blockchain\nsystem, it is extremely diﬃcult to attack\
    \ and tamper with its data. Therefore, data recorded\nin a blockchain is considered\
    \ as immutable”. Immutability can be disadvantageous in certain\noccasions. If\
    \ a transaction record is entered in a centralised system, it can be changed quite\
    \ easily\nunlike a blockchain system, the transaction record will be superseded\
    \ by the new transaction\nrecord and everything will be recorded in the ledger\
    \ as data in blockchain is immutable [60].\nThe existing EC estimating tools such\
    \ as GaBi, SimaPro, Athena, etc., that are used to estimate\nEC are controlled\
    \ by respective organisations. If a certain organisation decides to get rid of\
    \ the\ntool, all EC calculations carried out using this tool will be at stake.\
    \ However, the EC transactions\nrecorded in the blockchain-based EC system will\
    \ remain eternal throughout the life span of data\nas a result of immutability.\n\
    5.\nAuditability—A traditional information system and a blockchain system provide\
    \ auditability.\nHowever, auditing related to an information system is conducted\
    \ by third party personnel\nto reduce errors and bias [61]. Thus, the auditing\
    \ process of an information system results in\nadditional costs. In a blockchain\
    \ system, a node within the blockchain can publicly audit and share\ntransaction\
    \ records without relying on a trusted third party [62]. According to Zheng, et\
    \ al. [63],\neach transaction is validated and recorded with a timestamp in the\
    \ blockchain; therefore, any user\nBuildings 2020, 10, 140\n8 of 13\ncould trace\
    \ the previous records, providing higher auditability. Interviewee B mentioned\
    \ that\n“in a centralised system, the maintenance audit log exists within the\
    \ centralised system and the\ninternal team that handles the centralised system\
    \ has access to change the logs too. This issue\nis eliminated in a blockchain\
    \ system due to the feature, immutability, as it guarantees almost\n100% auditability”.\
    \ Therefore, a blockchain system has easier ways to fulﬁl auditing purposes\n\
    highlighting the suitability of using blockchain for accounting EC transactions.\n\
    6.\nVeracity—In any information system, veracity can be achieved to a greater\
    \ extent. Unlike manual\ntransactions, where there is a higher possibility for\
    \ human errors, in an automated information\nsystem, possibility for errors is\
    \ comparatively less. However, if erroneous data are entered,\nthe result will\
    \ be faulty. The same aspect is applicable for the blockchain system too. However,\
    \ in a\nblockchain system, there is a validation process that requires any record\
    \ to be validated by a\nmajority of the nodes for it to be recorded as a valid\
    \ transaction. If a faulty record is entered into\nthe blockchain, it will be\
    \ rejected by the nodes. Thus, veracity in a blockchain system is higher,\nmaking\
    \ it the best option for carbon accounting.\n7.\nTransparency—A traditional information\
    \ system has no transparency. Interviewee B emphasised\nthat “in a traditional\
    \ information system, the user has to blindly believe and trust the information\n\
    system and the data, which are displayed to them. The stakeholders/users have\
    \ no way of\nvalidating or checking on the accuracy of the data that are being\
    \ displayed or calculated at\nthe back end”. As an example, using an EC tool such\
    \ as GaBi is very risky, as the user is\nunaware of the method of calculation\
    \ that has been followed to estimate the EC. The user has to\nsimply enter the\
    \ materials used and the process carried out while the software calculates and\n\
    provides the EC estimate. The user is unable to validate the accuracy of the estimate\
    \ due to\nnon-transparency. However, in a blockchain system, one can easily backtrack\
    \ and identify the\nimportant information as well as the source of the data as\
    \ a result of transparency. Interviewees\nA and C agreed that greater transparency\
    \ provides a higher level of auditability. For an EC\nestimating platform, this\
    \ quality of transparency is essential to maintain positive relations with\nusers.\
    \ Carbon accounting in a transparent blockchain platform provides reliability\
    \ and trust\nalong with integrity.\n8.\nDisintermediation—Comparedtoatraditionalsystem,\
    \ ablockchainsystemenablesdisintermediation.\nDue to the difficulty of trusting\
    \ an unknown party, a reliable third-party such as banks or financial\ninstitutes\
    \ are involved when carrying out financial transactions. However, in a decentralised\n\
    blockchain platform, the third-party authorities are removed, and the key transfer\
    \ processes are\nverified and authenticated by nodes in the peer-to-peer network\
    \ [62]. The blockchain provides\ndisintermediation by removing the involvement\
    \ of a third party. In EC estimating, existing EC\ndatabases and tools act as\
    \ a third-party source that could completely change the estimate depending\non\
    \ various factors and issues as discussed previously. Currently, the EC estimates\
    \ are prepared\nby the land developer or very rarely the contractor, who will\
    \ become the third parties in carbon\ncalculation as they may not be the EC contributors\
    \ in certain occasions. For example, though it is\na manufacturer that contributes\
    \ to EC emissions, generally the estimate is prepared by the land\ndeveloper or\
    \ contractor. In a blockchain-based EC estimating system, EC transactions will\
    \ be\nrecorded by the EC contributors in CSCs enhancing the accuracy of the EC\
    \ estimates. Furthermore,\nthe results could be reviewed and analysed by the parties\
    \ who have access to the distributed ledger.\nRemoval of a third party enables\
    \ trust and accuracy while reducing any additional costs.\n9.\nTrust—Reliability\
    \ of data stored in a traditional information system can be questionable due to\n\
    the possibility of entering erroneous data. Therefore, one can be reluctant to\
    \ trust a traditional\ninformation system. However, in a blockchain system, any\
    \ transaction entered to the blockchain\nneeds to be validated by a majority of\
    \ the nodes for the transaction to be recorded in the blockchain.\nThis provides\
    \ great trust among users of a blockchain system. In order to record EC transactions\n\
    accurately, a trustworthy platform is required and thus blockchain is the ideal\
    \ solution. Trust is\nBuildings 2020, 10, 140\n9 of 13\nthe most important feature\
    \ for the stakeholders in the eco-system to trust the system and use\nblockchain\
    \ to estimate EC accurately.\n10.\nScalability—A traditional information system\
    \ accommodates scalability as it has the possibility\nin adapting to various changing\
    \ needs or demands of the users [64]. Interviewee C added that\n“scalability can\
    \ be categorised based on storage capacity, transaction time, and new functions”.\n\
    Buterin [65] declared that a public blockchain will be able to handle on average\
    \ 3–20 transactions\nper second, whereas, mainstream payment services such as\
    \ VISA, are currently handling\n24,000 transactions per second [66]. However,\
    \ the Bitcoin blockchain processes a maximum of\nseven transactions per second\
    \ and due to the scalability issue in the blockchain design, it is unable\nto\
    \ handle large amounts of transactions [53]. Therefore, the blockchain platform\
    \ initially had this\nscalability issue to a greater extent. Sharding has been\
    \ introduced as a solution to this scalability\nproblem. Through sharding, the\
    \ overheads of processing transactions are split among multiple,\nsmaller groups\
    \ of nodes [67]. According to Luu, et al. [68], Elastico is a proposed permission-less\n\
    blockchain where the agreement throughput is scaled up near linear with the computation\n\
    power of the network and tolerates byzantine adversaries to control up to one-fourth\
    \ of the\ncomputation capacity in a partial synchronous network. Though scalability\
    \ is one of the greatest\ndisadvantages of the blockchain system, if sharding\
    \ is introduced, it can be resolved. All experts\nagreed on introducing sharding\
    \ to resolve the scalability issue in blockchain. On the other hand,\nspeed or\
    \ data transaction rate is not an issue for accounting EC transactions as it has\
    \ a very low\nrate compared to other ﬁnancial services. Besides, the logical equations\
    \ that are used for EC\nestimating are consistent and on the other hand, they\
    \ are non-dependent on the features of a\nproject. Therefore, the speed of transactions\
    \ would not be much of an issue. The storage capacity\nto store all the EC transactions\
    \ is the only challenge that will be faced by the researcher. As a\nsolution for\
    \ this issue most relevant data can be stored on-chain and all other data could\
    \ be stored\noﬀ-chain to improve the eﬃciency of the system.\nThere are various\
    \ use cases that have already implemented blockchain in their systems due to\n\
    the additional beneﬁts provided through its salient features. SelfKey and ShoBadge\
    \ are two secure\nenterprise blockchain systems developed related to identiﬁcation\
    \ authentication using a digital\nwallet [69,70]. Arcade City is a blockchain-based\
    \ ride sharing platform that connects the drivers\nand passengers without the\
    \ involvement of a third party [71]. Power Ledger in Thailand provides\na peer-to-peer\
    \ renewable energy trading platform that ultimately evaluates the trading position\
    \ of\nindividual participants [72]. Filecoin is a digital storage and retrieval\
    \ system that rents their disk space\nfor data storage [73]. In Ghana, BitFury\
    \ and the Georgian government have collaborated to develop a\nland registry using\
    \ blockchain to resolve the current land disputes [7]. BIMCHAIN integrates Building\n\
    Information Modelling (BIM) and Blockchain to deliver trusted digital proofs with\
    \ a clear certiﬁcation\nprocess [74]. These are few of the use cases that have\
    \ used blockchain to develop various systems due to\nits salient features. Similarly,\
    \ blockchain technology could be used to develop an EC estimating system.\n4.\
    \ Conclusions\nBlockchain is an emerging technology that has drawn considerable\
    \ interest from various\nstart-ups, technology developers, enterprises, national\
    \ governments, and the academic community.\nInitially, blockchain was used for\
    \ recording cryptocurrency transactions. However, the trend has shifted\nto using\
    \ blockchain technology for various applications related to diﬀerent industries\
    \ such as science,\nproperty, and construction, among others. The study investigated\
    \ the potential application of using a\nblockchain system to estimate EC in CSCs\
    \ instead of a traditional information system. The extensive\nliterature review\
    \ and expert interviews revealed that compared to a traditional information system,\n\
    a blockchain system is more suitable for an application on accurate estimation\
    \ of EC in CSCs. The results\nhighlighted that most of the salient features of\
    \ blockchain technology (decentralisation, anonymity and\npseudonymity, security,\
    \ immutability, auditability, veracity, transparency, disintermediation, and trust\n\
    (without a third-party)) were quite high in a blockchain system compared to a\
    \ traditional information\nBuildings 2020, 10, 140\n10 of 13\nsystem, whereas,\
    \ scalability was comparatively less in a blockchain system. However, the transaction\n\
    rate in an EC estimating system in the practical context, is quite less and as\
    \ a result, this being\nthe only disadvantage, could be disregarded. In conclusion,\
    \ blockchain technology is positively\nsuitable to develop the EC estimating application,\
    \ compared to a traditional information system.\nA blockchain-based EC estimating\
    \ system could eliminate the existing issues in carbon estimating\nand contribute\
    \ to knowledge as well as the construction industry. The stakeholders involved\
    \ in the\nCSCs could beneﬁt from the EC estimating system that will be developed\
    \ using blockchain technology.\nHowever, the results of this study cannot be generalised\
    \ as the data were collected through a limited\nnumber of interviews due to various\
    \ limitations of the study, especially related to time constraints,\nmaturity\
    \ of the technology, and the knowledge level and experience of the experts. A\
    \ similar process\ncould be followed by other studies to compare blockchain systems\
    \ with traditional information systems,\nto decide on the suitability of using\
    \ blockchain technology for prototype systems.\nAuthor Contributions: Writing—original\

    (IoT) and Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) technology acts as a significant part of
    daily lives to facilitate control and monitoring of objects to revolutionize the
    ways that human interacts with physical world. IoT system includes large volume
    of data with network connectivity, power, and storage resources to transform data
    into meaningful information. Blockchain has decentralized nature to provide useful
    mechanism for addressing IoT challenges. Blockchain is distributed ledger with
    fundamental attributes, namely recorded, transparent, and decentralized. Blockchain
    formed participants in distributed ledger to record the transactions and communicate
    with other through trustless method. Security is considered as the most valuable
    features of Blockchain. IoT and Blockchain are emerging ideas for creating the
    applications to share the intrinsic features. Several existing works has been
    developed for the integration of blockchain with IoT. But, Blockchain protocols
    in the state-of-the-art works with IoT failed to consider the computational loads,
    delays, and bandwidth overhead which lead to new set of problems. The review estimates
    main challenges in integration of Blockchain and IoT technologies to attain high-level
    solutions by addressing the shortcomings and limitations of IoT and Blockchain
    technologies. Topic: Human-driven Edge Computing (HEC) 6G Research Challenges.

    is used to generate the large-scale index as security measure for all network
    communication. It operated as mutual, collective and common ledger. With development
    of crypto currencies, blockchain technology is said to be disruptive technology.
    It performed the transition from client-server to secured network. Blockchain
    is an immutable ledger for performing financial transactions. It has chain of
    time-stamped blocks associated with cryptographic hashes. It enabled the users
    in allocating the P2P network in which non-trusting members swap the data without
    intermediary. Trust is an essential block chain achieved through resultant hash
    of preceding block for generating the subsequent block. The resulting hash is
    authenticated by the miner nodes for finding the hash for the subsequent block.
    A bunch of transactions are coupled into the blocks by using Merkle tree. Merkle
    root hash is included in the block. A blockchain is a ledger spreading over the
    blockchain system. Blockchain comprised many connected blocks. The first block
    is termed as genesis block without parent block. A block structure comprised:
    Block version - collection of block validation which regulates to proceed. Hash
    of parent block - a 256-bit field that contains a hash value which points to the
    earlier block. Timestamp recording present time in seconds. Nonce from 0 and improve
    hash computation. Number of transactions MerkleRoot – accumulates hash value of
    all the transactions in the block. A blockchain is developing with the executed
    transactions. Once block is produced, all nodes are included in block corroboration.
    A validated block is included at the ending of blockchain by the reference symbolizing
    the parent block. The emerging technology has large potential impacts in many
    technological areas and Internet of Things in various aspects with decentralization,
    communications, transaction models and independent device coordination as described
    in [1]. The objective was to provide the ideas with structure and operation of
    Blockchain to examine technology usage for improving the privacy level in IoT.
    But the computational cost was not minimized. A new framework with layers termed
    Blockchain Structures (BCS) was introduced in [2] to identify association between
    IoT and BC for verification. Every BCS was arranged through Blockchain technology.
    However, it fails in improving the security level. The Blockchain and IoT technologies
    was integrated in [3] with high-level solutions for handling the shortcomings
    and limitations of both IoT and Blockchain technologies. Identification of exact
    problem in IoT and Blockchain technologies was not performed. The comprehensive
    review was carried out in [4] with block chain and IoT integration. The objective
    was to examine research trends on BC-related technologies in IoT context. It studied
    different application domains and arranging the literature with categorization
    but failed in resolving the complexity issues. The centralized architecture was
    constructed in [5] for minimizing the computational overhead. A distributed access
    control method was developed for device-to-device communication in IoT-enabled
    computerization. The security and privacy preservation were essential problems
    in centralized architecture. But, energy consumption of centralized architecture
    was higher. Channel State Information (CSI)-free strategies were introduced in
    [6] with large number of devices. CSI reduced as powered devices count gets increased.
    The distributed CSI-free plans increased energy coverage region with high reliability.
    However, the execution time was found to be higher. A comprehensive review of
    machine learning was carried out to identify potential benefits and problems for
    applications in 5G networks. QC-assisted and QML-based framework was introduced
    in [7] for 6G communication networks through addressing challenges. But it failed
    in improving the reliability level. Optical wireless communication (OWC) served
    5GB communication system demands. OWC technologies were used in [8] for exploitation
    of 5G/6G and IoT. The communication overhead of OWC served 5GB communication system
    was higher. The key technologies were reviewed in [9] to recognize every feature.
    Teraherz (THz) communications were employed to maintain mobile ultra-broadband,
    symbiotic radio and satellite-assisted communications. However, data integrity
    was lower. An integrated IoT platform with blockchain was introduced in [10] to
    assure the sensing data integrity. The main aim was to pay for device owner for
    effortless access to the devices in diverse areas. It presented the features of
    IoT systems for monitoring and controlling the end user. But communication overhead
    remains unaddressed. A secure and intelligent architecture was constructed in
    [11] for wireless networks through joining AI and blockchain to allow secure resource
    sharing. A blockchain empowered content caching issues were addressed to increase
    the system effectiveness and establish caching scheme through deep reinforcement
    learning. In secure and intelligent architecture, the privacy level of data was
    poor. The security module of IoT device was introduced in [12] depending on blockchain
    technology to avoid hacking and information infringement. The designed technology
    formed blockchain system with multi-security among IoT and user device. However,
    security level was not enhanced through authentication. The new technologies were
    introduced in [13] with wireless networks towards 6G for several cases. A full-stack,
    system-level viewpoint on 6G requirements were reviewed and chosen 6G machineries
    through introducing new communication models. But, central authority was not provided
    for enhancing the security level. A decentralized and cryptographically strong
    platform was introduced in [14] with immutability to avoid central authority utilization
    for authentication and communication. However, data confidentiality level was
    not improved. The blockchain technology addressed the problems with new facilities
    like distributed to improve the security level. Distributed ledger technologies
    were introduced in [15] to present solution for security and privacy problems.
    Though privacy was preserved, the execution time was not reduced. Table 1 describes
    the list of abbreviations in the article. TABLE 1 List of Abbreviations A. Related
    Works Several review papers distributed by various authors on blockchain in 6G-enabled
    IoT for automation. Scope of Survey: As per the requirement of the survey paper,
    research in the direction of IoT and BC is to be considered. A lot of research
    is required to be done for addressing the issues of security with the blockchain
    technology solution. Research is to be carried out to enable the scalability of
    the integrating blockchain with IoT. Many reviews based on author knowledge concentrated
    on security problems and determined the suitability of block chain to perform
    secured communication. A study was also taken for block chain technology, 6G network,
    IoT with taxonomy of the security problems. However, a complete survey that focuses
    all probable security susceptibilities of communication system is not available.
    Some literatures failed to portray about the incorporation of block chain technology
    and 5G network. In [16], the effectiveness of combining blockchain for IoT in
    different applications was presented by studying Blockchain-enabled Intelligent
    IoT framework with Artificial Intelligence. But computational power and latency
    issues were not resolved. Later, Blockchain based decentralized application was
    employed in [17] for allowing IoT edge processing. It remains possible for the
    resource owner to integrate the ecosystem and provide necessitated resources.
    Edge computation was carried out by IoT devices to resource owner nodes if needed.
    An architectural framework was studied in [18] to enable blockchain in IoT applications.
    An oneM2M-based IoT platform and blockchain system termed Logchain was employed
    to guarantee block integrity. But security issues remains unaddressed. Blockchain
    and Edge Computing were joined in [19] to deal with the inhibited nature of IoT.
    Framework was constructed to minimize IoT device needs for memory capacity and
    to enhance performance results. The challenges were evaluated with the Blockchain
    and Edge Computing architecture. However, resource optimization was not performed.
    The techno-economic factors and normative assumptions were taken in [20] to enable
    the propertization. Blockchain applications include the results opposite to intended
    ones for contributing the IoT based user privacy. But, the privacy level of data
    remains low. In [21], the convergence of blockchain and IoT was discussed. However,
    the data analytics on blockchain data remains difficult. A full-fledged approach
    for the engineering was developed in [22] by combining the Aggregate Computing
    and Opportunistic IoT Service models. But the computational complexity remains
    unaddressed. The opportunities and challenges associated to blockchain convention
    in 6G were discussed in [15]. However, Security level was not enhanced. The reshaping
    and conversion of DTs by Blockchain was discussed in [23] to secure manufacturing.
    But privacy issues were not concerned. In [24], the utilization of blockchain
    for value extraction in 5G was discussed. The existing centralized architecture
    was described in [25] for handling the huge volume of data created in the IoT.
    It experiences security and privacy issues. The key characteristics of cognitive-inspired
    computing were explained in [26] for resolving the security and privacy issues.
    An intelligent data fusion algorithm based on hybrid delay-aware clustering (HDC)
    was presented in [27]. The clustering patterns of the cluster were chosen by the
    decision function to achieve optimize between network delay and energy consumption.
    However, the execution time was higher. Dynamic spectrum access algorithm was
    designed in [28] depended on game theory to perform spectrum leasing and interference
    mitigation among Secondary Users. But computational cost remains higher. In order
    to resolve the security issues, counter the threats and to provide efficiency,
    a new authentication scheme for demand response management was designed in [29].
    But the data integrity level remains lower. Later, A temporal credential based
    anonymous lightweight authentication scheme (TCALAS) was developed in [30] for
    Internet of Drones (IoD) networks. TCALAS provided security against threats. In
    [31], a secure routing and monitoring protocol with multi-variant tuples using
    Two-Fish (TF) symmetric key approach was designed. It helped to avoid the adversaries
    in the global sensor network. But the reliability level was poor. Table 2 explained
    the summary of surveys and variations with proposed review. TABLE 2 Challenges
    of Blockchain With IoT for 6G B. Contribution of This Survey At present several
    review papers were examined in literature, however the possible security problems
    of blockchain enabled IoT with 6G were not addressed anywhere. The main contributions
    of the article are: Examine the security problems with blockchain enabled IoT
    with 6G communication network and describe comprehensive analysis on it. Establish
    an in-depth study of research challenges in incorporation of blockchain with 6G
    communication network. Address the open problems and suggest the future research
    guidelines toward blockchain enabled IoT with 6G communication. C. Organization
    and Reading Map The organization of this article is illustrated in Figure 1: The
    outline of blockchain technologies with blockchain benefits for 6G is explained
    in Section 2. In Section 3, integration of IoT in blockchain is discussed. Section
    4 describes the research challenges of blockchain with IoT enabled devices. Section
    5 portrays blockchain and IoT integration solutions. Section 6 explains the application
    of blockchain with 6G enabled IoT devices. Section 7 concludes the paper. FIGURE
    1. Structure of survey article. Show All SECTION II. Background The background
    and history of blockchain, 6G and IoT is explained in this section. In addition,
    how IoT affects the 6G communication and how BC secure communication networks
    are described. A. Blockchain Technologies A sequence of blocks linked by hash
    value of preceding block is termed as Blockchain (BC). A block accumulated the
    data. In BC, authority gets decentralized where each member of BC network legalizes
    the transaction. Every transaction gets marked and validation is carried out through
    verifying the transaction by the entire mining node in network. The node included
    immutable transaction records between BC parties. BC addressed the third-party
    system requirements for performing efficient transaction. It lessens the processing
    time and cost in performing the transaction over the blockchain network. When
    miner node transmits new block to decentralized BC network, each member of BC
    consists of a choice to include block. Blockchain enhanced the interoperability,
    privacy, security and scalability during the data communication. A blockchain
    was combined with IoT and named as Blockchain of Things (BCoT). BCoT comprised
    of the following merits: The capability of communication with physical system
    and information exchange among the IoT systems is defined as Interoperability.
    Blockchain-composite layer constructed on P2P network with standard access among
    various IoT systems. Traceability of IoT data is potential of detecting and authenticating
    the spatial and temporal data of data block. In blockchain, each data block comprises
    historic timestamp. The data quality being trustworthy is defined as reliability
    of IoT data. It is guaranteed through integrity by cryptographic mechanism with
    asymmetric encryption methods, hash functions and digital signature. Autonomic
    interaction of IoT system characterized the potential of IoT system cooperating
    with each other without third party. The autonomy is attained through smart contracts
    allowed through the blockchains. The contract clauses in smart contracts get implemented
    when condition is satisfied. Blockchain is not same as distributed systems depending
    on the consensus property. Trust-less: The network entities are indefinite to
    other. They converse, assist and team up with others devoid of deliberating them.
    No specialized digital identity is necessitated to carry out transaction between
    entities. Permission-less: Restriction is not provided for functioning within
    the network. Censorship resistant: Any persons interact with others on blockchain.
    The confirmed transaction is not modified. Blockchain technology included four
    components: Consensus: Proof-of-Work protocol verifies every action in network
    for avoiding single miner node from managing blockchain network and for manipulating
    the transaction history. Ledger: It is shared and distributed database with information
    about all transactions performed within the network. It is undeniable through
    nature where information once stored is not deleted. It guarantees that every
    transaction is verified and accepted as valid one though many clients at particular
    time. Cryptography: It guaranteed that all network data is secured with the strong
    cryptographic encryption. It allowed the authorized users to decrypt existing
    information. Smart Contract: It is employed to validate and verify the network
    participants. Blockchain are categorized depending on managed data, availability
    and access control. Figure 2 describes the architecture diagram of blockchain
    in 6G. Every challenge is clearly described below. FIGURE 2. Architecture diagram
    of Blockchain in 6G. Show All 1) Massive Connectivity in Future Systems a: Scalability
    Number of devices linked and functioned in future industrial ecosystems are forecasted
    by industrial IoT enthusiast with the concepts of massive Machine Type Communications
    (mMTC). Adaption of 6G systems for unprecedented traffic demand remains as a challenging
    one. Real-time communication is established with less latency. The real-time communication
    acts as an essential need in the upcoming computing ecosystems. A higher accuracy
    with zero delay is achieved by D2D and M2M communication for precise operation.
    AR helped healthcare systems perform delay communication in huge-scale data exchange.
    b: Higher Throughput The decisive systems applied 5G communication ecosystems
    for providing concurrent connectivity to number of devices. The network organization
    like base station managed the large number of real time transactions. c: Synchronization
    Synchronization acts as a significant requirement in time vital industrial applications.
    Efficient operation is attained by the mission critical backbone systems with
    power allocation systems and vehicular networks harmonized in real time application.
    2) Security Requirements in Future Computing Ecosystems a: Confidentiality and
    Integrity The future computing infrastructure portrayed enormous threat surfaces
    with wireless connectivity. The encryption methods are lightweight for minimum
    powered IoT devices. Due to computational restraints, Lightweight cryptographic
    methods interpret the data into privacy risks. The huge volume of data formed
    by future systems is required to be accessed and adapted by the legal users during
    transmission. The eavesdropping and adaptation of data in transmission altered
    the system operation from expected performance. b: Availability The service accessibility
    is the significant requirement in upcoming networks. The superiority of 6G ecosystems
    with huge volume of interrelated devices prolonged the risk of DDoS attacks. c:
    Authentication and Access Control The federal authentication and access control
    methods get restrain in huge volume futuristic demands forecasted in 6G. The sophisticated
    access control required to equal the diversification of future tenants in 6G ecosystem
    are resource-intensive and origins bottlenecks in associated services. d: Audit
    An audit is required to assess the compliance of tenant actions in network ecosystem.
    Deep packet level audit identifies and flag the tenant behavior for superior security
    principles. Huge number of tenants auditing remains as a challenging one in security
    perspective. 3) Higher Data Consumption in Sophisticated Solutions The higher
    data rate is an essential prospect in future network ecosystems. The applications
    like VR, holographic communications, video and 3D ultra-video necessitated enhanced
    data rate and data utilization. 4) Device Resource Restrictions The computational
    and storage limitations are detected to restrict the abilities of cryptographic
    methods and caused variation from standard mechanisms. The standard implementation
    of security is harder with the device resource restrictions. B. Blockchain Benefits
    for 6G Blockchain is an essential technology to allow the potential of 6G systems
    and address the existing potential demands. Intelligent resource management: The
    network resource organization is a challenging one in huge connectivity demands
    of upcoming telecommunication ecosystems. The resource management functions such
    as spectrum allocation, orchestration and decentralized evaluation are compatible
    with the huge infrastructure. Intelligent network framework is applied with the
    blockchain technology by managing the association among operators and users. Based
    on game theory, the authors implemented an unlicensed spectrum sharing method.
    The blockchain and deep reinforcement learning was performed to carry out the
    resource management services with spectrum allocation and energy organization.
    1) Elevated Security Features a: Privacy The privacy is significant in security
    characteristic. Data privacy application is varied in complex security necessities
    for 6G network ecosystem. A privacy preserved approach was implemented based on
    blockchain for content-centric 6G networks. b: Authentication and Access Control
    Access control of centralized systems experienced scalability constraints. The
    access control with centralization remains as an essential demand in the future
    networks. A verification and access control approach depended on blockchain was
    implemented for cloud radio over the fiber network in 6G. c: Accountability The
    accountability of 6G beyond the network ecosystem is an important requirement.
    The blockchain and dispersed ledger technology applied security, inspection and
    authority of network. SECTION III. Integration of IoT in Blockchain An IoT is
    a diverse available manual method into digitalized description through processing
    large amount of data. The large data is employed for increasing the quality of
    life during digitalization process. The development in cloud computing was used
    for IoT with essential functions. IoT development has new possibility to attain
    and allocate the data. There is no confidence among the public because they not
    have clear idea of used data. It makes the developments to IoT through trusted
    sharing service distribution. The data source is identified at any time and improved
    the security level. The security is an essential requirement to guarantee that
    data get shared between available users. A breach in data resulted in the loss
    of private records and sensitive data. IoT represent network of many electronic
    devices to communicate with others through open channel. The connection was carried
    out through wireless technology such as sensor networks, field communication,
    etc. IoT adjusted the ubiquitous computing with several industrial applications.
    Security: When linked device count of network increases, the vulnerability development
    through external attacks also enhances because of minimum standard device application.
    Privacy: The data gathered is broadcasted from IoT devices to cloud storage for
    processing with third party. The data allocation without the user authority creates
    data leaks. Standards: Lack of regulations resulted in undesirable results while
    organizing the constituted devices. Latency: The communication principles for
    various IoT devices caused latency problems. IoT-enabled devices supported the
    data transmission at higher bandwidth. The devices handled the variations in the
    configuration like higher bandwidth capacity, increased data-rate and minimal
    latency. SECTION IV. Research Challenges of Blockchain With IoT Enabled 6G Devices
    An IoT and blockchain has large concern from the academic circles and industry.
    Bitcoin-style blockchain depend on PoW designs with features for many IoT scenarios.
    With fast development in IoT devices, energy needs are limited. The existing client/server
    systems are replaced by Blockchain. Information accumulated in nodes is termed
    as IoT devices. The devices comprise of less computational power and storage capacity
    to resolve the big hurdle in technology adoption. The research challenges of blockchain
    with IoT enabled 6G devices are described in Figure 3. FIGURE 3. Research challenges.
    Show All Blockchain gets increased when nodes count in the network increases.
    There is no equivalence and interoperability where various ledgers not converse
    with others. The stakeholders are essential one to attain complete interoperability.
    It required international strategies for collective trust and information security.
    The firm business cases are not carried out due to the uncertainties. The people
    are in quandary state of acceptance for industries. It connects different stakeholders
    in regions without legal compliance. It is demanding for service providers and
    productions to accept blockchain in diverse business cases. IoT devices are upgraded
    to the compatible one with high speed network connectivity. SECTION V. Blockchain
    and IoT Integration Solutions IoT designers had chosen the appropriate solution
    depending on restrictions and needs. There is no comprehensive analysis and resolutions
    for IoT manufacturers to attain the appropriate Blockchain platform for integrations.
    IoT devices required Blockchain to accumulate the state, handle multiple writers
    and avoid hiring the trusted third party. Block time and transactions per second
    (TPS) is taken depending on the importance for IoT devices to select the appropriate
    platform. IoT application has enough knowledge regarding the restrictions and
    needs like time-sensitivity, transactions and resources. The awareness assisted
    the IoT devices to describe the proper platform. Scalability, security, privacy
    and smart capability are the additional metrics that must be satisfied before
    implementation on IoT devices. A powerful decentralized network was constructed
    with developer tools for smart contracts, security and contract execution with
    high level of reliability. With advanced applications to enhance the superiority
    of citizen life, IoT acts essential in-service digitization. The access points
    were used to access and distribute the network information. Centralized data storage
    systems have contributed for development of IoT. A centralized structure not presented
    the data transparency. Blockchain technology is an essential resolution to increase
    the security and privacy. Blockchain can reform the IoT with open, dependence
    and auditable sharing platform. Figure 4 described the blockchain with 6G-enabled
    IoT for industrial application. FIGURE 4. Benefits of blockchain with 6G-enabled
    IoT for industrial automation. Show All Decentralization and Scalability: Paradigm
    shift from the centralized to decentralize for eliminating failure to increase
    the fault tolerance performance. It restricted the oligarchy of resources where
    corporations manage gathering and processing of data. Identity: The common blockchain
    carried out better identification of every device. The authentication of IoT devices
    is not provided. Autonomy: The mobile devices cooperate with each other by means
    of blockchain to implement the IoT-based industrial applications. Security: Information
    exchanges are considered as transactions using new agreements to provide the protected
    inter-device communication. Reliability: The incorporation allowed the users for
    validating the legitimacy of transaction with confidence and responsibility. Secure
    code deployment: A manufacturer traced the revise history and allowed them to
    update IoT devices securely. SECTION VI. Applications of Blockchain of Things
    With 6G A categorization of blockchain- industrial applications in 6G-enabled
    IoT is described. It comprised conventional sectors of interest for different
    purposes like smart manufacturing, supply chain management, food industry, smart
    grid, healthcare, multimedia and digital right management, agriculture and internet
    of vehicles and unmanned aerial vehicles. Blockchain and 6G increased the security
    as well as bandwidth with minimal operational and capital expenditure. The blockchain
    application for 6G-enabled IoT is described in above Figure 5. The detailed description
    is given in next subsections. FIGURE 5. Applications of Blockchain for 6G-enabled
    IoT. Show All A. Smart Manufacturing The manufacturing industry gets upgraded
    from the automatic to smart technology. Large amount of data is created in each
    lifecycle phase with product designing, allocation, sell and service. The data
    get partitioned and resulted in data collection difficulty and data analytics.
    IoT systems are linked through P2P network for performing the data sharing in
    industrial sectors and interoperability issues are resolved. BCoT enhanced the
    security of smart manufacturing. B. Supply Chain Management A cluster of persons,
    sources and actions in product lifecycle is termed as Supply chain. It initiates
    from the creation process to sale process starting at supplier to manufacturer.
    The supply chain starts with supplier followed by producer, trader, seller and
    customer as shown in Figure 6. FIGURE 6. Usual flows in supply chain. Show All
    The process to handle the data and finances when they change by supply chain process
    is defined as Supply Chain Management (SCM). A product comprised multiple parts
    presented through different manufacturers across the countries. It is expensive
    for applying anti-fraud technologies in each product. During blockchain and IoT
    combination, every part linked with new ID. An immutable timestamp gets connected
    with ID. The recognition of each part recorded into blockchain that are tamper-resistant
    and perceptible. Traceability ontology was introduced with IoT and blockchain
    technologies depending on the Ethereum blockchain policy to guarantee the data
    provenance. BCoT minimized the costs in services. The blockchain and IoT integration
    minimized the cost and risk with high speed. Secured data sharing is attained
    among different endeavors to improve the customer service by blockchain based
    machine learning platform. C. Food Industry BCoT enhanced the product life cycle
    in food industry. The traceability of food products acts essential for assuring
    the food safety. It is a demanding one to guarantee food traceability for IoT.
    A food company included several of suppliers. The traceability required raw material
    data from sources for food manufacturing. Blockchain assured the traceability
    and food industry data origin. RFID and blockchain is employed for launching the
    supply chain platform from farming for food manufacture in China. The system guaranteed
    food supply-chain data traceability. Blockchain technology increased the food
    safety through provision of traceable food products. The combination of blockchain
    allowed the customers to track food production. Depending on blockchain and IoT
    tags, a food safety traceability system was introduced. The designed system prevented
    the data corruption and privacy revelation through smart contracts. D. Smart Grid
    The distributed renewable energy resources appearance alters with energy consumers
    from pure shoppers to prosumers. Energy prosumers with additional energy trade
    it to additional consumers. P2P energy trading is the energy between prosumer
    and consumer. It is a demanding one to ensure the secured energy dealing in distributed
    atmosphere. The blockchain technology provided opportunities to guarantee the
    secured P2P energy trading. An energy trading system was introduced depending
    on consortium blockchains to save cost without broker through blockchains consensus.
    A decentralized energy-trading system was introduced depending on blockchain for
    preserving the confidential transaction in smart grid. E. Healthcare Healthcare
    is one of the most important social-economic issues because of population. It
    included the new demands in healthcare services due to inadequate hospitals. The
    development in wearable healthcare devices provided healthcare data bring opportunities
    for providing the remote monitoring services at home. The wearable devices determine
    and gather the health-care data with heartbeat, diabetes and pressure investigation.
    With the aid of networks, Doctors access the health-care data at anytime and anywhere.
    The vulnerability of healthcare devices has many challenges in privacy preservation
    with higher data security. The blockchains were integrated into healthcare networks
    to address the privacy protection of health-care data. The blockchain technology
    preserved healthcare data stored in cloud servers. The health-care data collected
    through medical sensors and transmitted to system for patient monitoring. The
    privacy preservation is carried out in efficient manner. Blockchain was employed
    to manage the individual healthcare data and to support the data-sharing. Blockchain
    system ensured the privacy and security of healthcare data. An attribute-based
    signature method was introduced in healthcare blockchain systems. The designed
    scheme verified the legitimacy of health-care data and recognition of health-care
    data owner. Attribute-based signature method improved the privacy level of data
    owner in healthcare applications. F. Internet of Vehicles and Unmanned Aerial
    Vehicles Internet of vehicles (IoV) integrated vehicle to-vehicle networks, vehicle-to-roadside
    networks, vehicle-to infrastructure networks and vehicle-to-pedestrian networks.
    The blockchain is integrated with IoV to address the security problems. A trust-management
    policy was used on blockchains in IoV. Their liability of messages gets authorized
    through PoW/PoS consensus implemented through RSUs. Blockchain technologies employed
    to conserve the energy and data communication among electric vehicles and hybrid
    electric vehicles in smart grids. G. Agriculture Smart agriculture employed the
    new technologies like IoT, GPS and Bigdata for increasing the quantity of agricultural
    products. Information are stored in control system and examined by AI. The combination
    of information technologies in smart agriculture makes agricultural supply chain
    as cost-effective. Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) enhanced the effectiveness,
    traceability and simplicity in agricultural supply chains. For avoiding the redundant
    difficulties to accumulate data on blockchain, two associated structure must be
    designed. Basic Planting Information: Information regarding specific process of
    supply chain like production and accumulation is gathered. Provenance Record:
    Information regarding agricultural operation is stored. H. Multimedia and Digital
    Right Management Media distribution is a category of digital multimedia contents
    allocation like audio, image and video. The merits of conventional online content
    delivery medium incorporated enhanced accessibility, cost and higher performance.
    Due to minimal housing cost, cloud-based Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) are
    chosen. The designed systems included the inherent problems that are not easy
    to resolve. Blockchain-based RIGHTs management system (BRIGHT) aimed on video
    files of blockchain. The existing multimedia failed to conserve any data with
    respect to ownership or media adaptation records. The original media are tampered
    for particular purposes to widen the false information over the social media.
    The watermark comprised information about two characteristics: Image Hash: It
    is applied for securing the original media content to get regained when required.
    Cryptographic Hash: It comprised transaction record that represents any alteration
    types to the original media. SECTION VII. Conclusion and Future Scope With fast
    development in number of connected IoT device, many obstacles occur to minimize
    the adoption of IoT across different applications. There are many concerns about
    the interoperability as solutions implemented create the new data silos. The centralized
    architecture of IoT solution needs the IoT device owners to trust the organizations
    to maintain the data safe. Blockchain is a promising technology that helped with
    IoT systems resiliency. A distributed ledger avoided centralized architecture
    challenges and stores data through its characteristics. Blockchain construct the
    trust between IoT devices and minimized risk of tampering with Blockchain cryptography.
    It minimized the cost through eliminating the middlemen and intermediary’s overhead.
    Blockchain provide solution to address many IoT challenges but any convergence
    between two embedded technologies creates new issues and obstacles. The characteristic
    of Blockchain gets changed because of IoT requirements like security, data privacy,
    consensus protocol and smart contracts. Several research papers on Blockchain
    integration with IoT are reviewed to examine the security issues. From this survey,
    it is found that the blockchain technology developed for IoT network fails in
    performance due to more energy consumption, execution time and communication overhead.
    In some existing works, the data confidentiality and integrity level also remain
    low. The research challenges and open issues in incorporation of blockchain with
    6G communication network are analyzed. Then, the future research guidelines toward
    blockchain enabled IoT with 6G communication is provided. The future scope of
    this article is to integrate the blockchain with IoT 6G technologies for reducing
    the computational cost. Security and privacy issues of 5G technologies are to
    be reduced depending on demands and requirements. Authors Figures References Citations

    Footnotes Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the existing
    blockchain protocols for the Internet of Things (IoT) networks. We start by describing
    the blockchains and summarizing the existing surveys that deal with blockchain
    technologies. Then, we provide an overview of the application domains of blockchain
    technologies in IoT, e.g., Internet of Vehicles, Internet of Energy, Internet
    of Cloud, Edge computing, etc. Moreover, we provide a classification of threat
    models, which are considered by blockchain protocols in IoT networks, into five
    main categories, namely identity-based attacks, manipulation-based attacks, cryptanalytic
    attacks, reputation-based attacks, and service-based attacks. In addition, we
    provide a taxonomy and a side-by-side comparison of the state-of-the-art methods
    toward secure and privacy-preserving blockchain technologies with respect to the
    blockchain model, specific security goals, performance, limitations, computation
    complexity, and communication overhead. Based on the current survey, we highlight
    open research challenges and discuss possible future research directions in the
    blockchain technologies for IoT. Published in: IEEE Internet of Things Journal

    Citations Keywords Metrics Abstract: This study aims to explore the current status,
    potential applications, and future directions of blockchain technology in supply
    chain management. A literature survey, along with an analytical review, of blockchain-based
    supply chain research was conducted to better understand the trajectory of related
    research and shed light on the benefits, issues, and challenges in the blockchain-supply-chain
    paradigm. A selected corpus comprising 106 review articles was analyzed to provide
    an overview of the use of blockchain and smart contracts in supply chain management.
    The diverse industrial applications of these technologies in various sectors have
    increasingly received attention by researchers, engineers, and practitioners.
    Four major issues: traceability and transparency, stakeholder involvement and
    collaboration, supply chain integration and digitalization, and common frameworks
    on blockchain-based platforms, are critical for future orientation. Traditional
    supply chain activities involve several intermediaries, trust, and performance
    issues. The potential of blockchain can be leveraged to disrupt supply chain operations
    for better performance, distributed governance, and process automation. This study
    contributes to the comprehension of blockchain applications in supply chain management
    and provides a blueprint for these applications from the perspective of literature
    analysis. Future efforts regarding technical adoption/diffusion, block-supply
    chain integration, and their social impacts were highlighted to enrich the research

    a proliferation of research, projects, and discussions regarding distributed ledger
    technology (DLT) has increasingly attracted the attention of researchers and practitioners.
    The reason lies in the characteristics that DLT may deliver promising disruption
    to the current model of trust, which has long created operational pain points
    of centralized systems. Traditional business operations rely heavily on a centralized
    authority or third parties, such as banks, to promote trust among participants
    [1], [2]. However, they have often been the targets of malicious attacks, malfunction
    and artificial alterations. The emergence of blockchain technology may bring about
    a rethinking of the design of business operations by virtue of its distributed
    and decentralized characteristics [3]. Blockchain, a DLT, refers to a consecutive
    list of time-stamped records (usually digital transaction data) sequentially linked
    using cryptography. A peer-to-peer network of participating nodes contribute to
    the formation and validation of blockchain and manages distributed consensus by
    network majority. This makes blockchain an immutable, secure, and trustless model
    where transactions among parties are concerned. Blockchain technology has the
    potential to rebuild the way businesses conduct their operations [1], [4]. Several
    use cases have been investigated using the concept of blockchain, which could
    function as a distributed database without third parties. Several research endeavors
    regarding trade finance [5], medical record management [6], voting [7], and insurance
    industries [8] have improved the visibility of blockchain. Supply chain management
    (SCM) is one of these potential applications [9]–[13]. Growing efforts have been
    devoted to the study of blockchain technology and its applications across various
    sectors [9]. The scope of this research ranges from technical discussion [14],
    [15], application feasibility [16], business operations [4], to even legal issues
    [17] and user acceptance [18]. Gathering information from 106 articles, including
    journal and conference papers published in a variety of sources during the period
    2016 to early 2020, this study presents illustrative topics related to blockchain
    evolution in the recent decade. The major research methods adopted in these studies
    have also been reported to outline the relationship between the main topics and
    methodologies. Among extant literature, research regarding the application of
    blockchain technology in supply chains is rather fragmented and diverse in topics
    [19], [20]. This phenomenon indicates a promising research interest but less-organized
    comprehension among the literature distribution. While researchers presented their
    early efforts regarding blockchain-based supply chain literature, there was a
    lack of qualified peer-reviewed articles that could be aggregated and analyzed
    in the current research’s limited time frame. In [19], the first blockchain-related
    supply chain literature survey was conducted prior to January 2018 under scientific
    rigor with a peer-reviewed process. The authors also collected several blockchain
    trial pilots to demonstrate their contributions, and suggested second-round surveys
    to capture the rapid development of blockchain technology in the realm of SCM.
    Similarly, another study in the same-period [20] highlighted examples of blockchain-SCM
    integration while reporting the scarcity of related studies in leading journals
    and databases. In this study, the researchers highlighted the early adoption of
    blockchain in the electric power industry with a relatively mature understanding
    of blockchain-SCM integration. Both these papers reviewed only a few studies before
    2018, i.e., 29 and 27 papers, respectively. These initial literature reviews are
    not adequate for providing a general overview, and a literature update is required
    due to the rapid proliferation of blockchain-based supply chain research from
    year 2018 to early 2020. Unlike the aforementioned review articles, this current
    work aims to provide a more holistic analysis of scenarios of blockchain use in
    supply chains by supplementing academic research for the past two years. Since
    blockchain with its unique features allows more streamlined business processes
    [21], [22], and enhanced transparency and trust among stakeholders, exploring
    its applications in supply chains is important for both academics and practitioners.
    We also realize the need for reporting the current status and potential of blockchain
    and its emerging applications across different industries in the SCM context.
    In this regard, we proposed certain questions to develop the logical connection
    between relevant extant articles and the potential for further research. The research
    questions in this study are as follows: RQ1:What are the main topics and subjects
    of interest in supply chain studies that utilize blockchain technology; how do
    they address its core issues; and how have these topics evolved over time? RQ2:What
    are the main research methodologies employed in blockchain-based supply chain
    literature and how are they related to the main topics? RQ3:Which blockchain-supply-chain
    papers were most instrumental in driving the development of literature thus far?
    To answer these questions, we adopted a systematic literature review (SLR) to
    gain insights regarding correlated issues. The aim of using SLR was to present
    a general overview of recent research by conducting a systematic analysis of extant
    literature. Thus, we outline the understanding regarding the research path based
    on our comprehension of related research interests and topic distributions. This
    paper contributes to the understanding of blockchain applications in the field
    of SCM by exploring various research topics and directions for future research.
    The literature analysis highlighted several potential research areas that may
    point out certain research gaps for future study. The remainder of this paper
    is organized as follows. Section II describes the basic knowledge regarding blockchain
    and smart contracts. Section III presents the methodology and procedural steps
    utilized in this review and Section IV reports findings from the analysis of literature.
    Section V identifies the main research issues, challenges, and implications, before
    the final conclusion is presented in Section VI. SECTION II. Preliminaries A.
    Blockchain Nakamoto [23] proposed the concept of a decentralized digital currency,
    Bitcoin, supported by a decentralized payment system. Decentralization refers
    to an operating mechanism that allows peer-to-peer (P2P) exchange or transactions
    without centralized authorities. This disruptive innovation eliminates the heavy
    reliance on powerful third parties. Blockchain is the technology underpinning
    the Bitcoin cryptocurrency, which is a consecutive growing list of blocks, wherein
    each block records encrypted transactional data and may have further potential
    for other decentralization purposes [24]. The operating nodes in this kind of
    collaborative network have a duplicate record of transactional information, known
    as a “ledger.” Inherently shared by participating nodes, DLT provides the opportunities
    for a trustless operating environment without traditional trusted authorities
    such as banks and clearing houses. P2P exchange facilitates trust building among
    participating nodes and the shared ledger is maintained by nodes in the network.
    Computer nodes comply with an encrypted protocol to verify updated data in the
    shared ledger. This kind of distributed ledger system harvests the benefits of
    decentralized governance which may solve the issue of information exposure and
    accountability [25]. This inherent attribute favors the interactions between counterparties
    in the context of business operations [26]. Critical information could be maintained
    without checking the consistency of individual data and every single node possesses
    a duplicate of transactional data, thereby enhancing the transparency and visibility
    of business activities. In a supply chain context, this kind of system and operational
    scheme may provide a better foundation of trust as well as benefits resulting
    from the absence of a centralized authority and intermediation [12]. Accordingly,
    blockchain could further be utilized to record the ownership of assets [27], permissions,
    and activity logs. This improves the traceability of information, cash, and process
    flows, and thus provides timely tracking of products and services. The different
    types of blockchain are public, private, and consortium (or federated) blockchains,
    each of which could be applied in certain scenarios to gain better advantages
    and for effectiveness. B. Smart Contracts Smart contracts are programmable protocols
    that allow the execution of contract terms and agreements. The concept was first
    proposed by Szabo [28], who defined a smart contract as “a computerized transaction
    protocol that executes the terms of a contract.” Thus, smart contracts can be
    deployed to a blockchain database and users can develop computer codes based on
    contractual clauses [29]. Contracts are executed when certain preset conditions
    are met. Smart contracts may outperform traditional contracts due to advantages
    such as allowing the mitigation of intermediaries among transacting counterparties
    and the facilitation of transaction flows without malicious alterations and tampering
    [30]. Smart contracts can be deployed on blockchain platforms in terms of scripts
    and stored with specific addresses for functional calls similar to those performed
    in other programmable computer languages [31]. They may facilitate data-driven
    interactions in the blockchain network and further allow applications to meet
    supply chain objectives. Smart contracts are essential in the use of blockchain
    applications. A potential use case for smart contracts is in SCM. For example,
    a comprehensive paper-based process of administrative auditing may hinder the
    overall performance of a supply chain. Regulated conditions and agreements can
    be coded in smart contracts to avoid fraud, theft or other managerial risks. When
    smart contracts are deployed in the blockchain network, they are transferred to
    each connected node. Latest changes recorded in the local database may in turn
    trigger the conditions prescribed in computer codes to execute related process
    flows or notifications [32]. This is referred to as an event-driven mechanism,
    which can be facilitated without interference from a single entity. Typical use
    cases include conditioned payment transactions [33], [34], and asset and proprietary
    transfers [35]. With data updates and an event-driven mechanism, smart contracts
    may facilitate the manipulation of supply chain activities [36]. For example,
    commercial pilots, such as IBM and Maersk, recently announced their successful
    adoption of blockchain technology and smart contracts for shipment tracking and
    facilitating trade finance. Traditional paper-based procedures dealing with the
    collection and presentation of commercial documents could be significantly mitigated
    with the use of smart contracts [37]. This technology can reduce transaction costs
    and the number of involved intermediaries, and improve trade efficiency to achieve
    process automation. Smart contracts on a blockchain-based platform can have applications
    in various fields; however, previous studies have reported certain unresolved
    issues with respect to technical and legal concerns [38]. For example, contract
    vulnerabilities with regard to transaction-ordering and timestamp dependence,
    mishandled exceptions, re-entrance, and callstack issues [39]. To pursue a wider
    spectrum of applications, more research endeavors must focus on solving validation/verification
    issues [40], enhancing security and privacy, and contract-based integration with
    other technologies [41]–[43]. Smart contracts may facilitate obligation execution
    and process automation among parties based on technical openness, however, its
    long-term development still requires a cross-disciplinary approach, combining
    technological, economic, and legitimation practices. SECTION III. Methods To answer
    the research questions, we conducted an SLR to gain further insights into the
    relationship, integration, and development of blockchain technology in the realm
    of SCM. SLR is a kind of review genre that places strong emphasis on utilizing
    a series of standard processes to search, screen, analyze, and review literature,
    along with providing comments or suggestions. Since blockchain and its affiliated
    technology, i.e., smart contracts, have only emerged in the past decade, related
    works, technological standards, and innovative applications are still in their
    nascent stages. We selected the latest four years, 2016~2019 (extended to early
    2020), as the time span of this literature survey to capture the most updated
    usage of these technologies in SCM. This study followed previous research guidelines
    to construct a robust and replicable study [44]–[46]. Additionally, to explore
    and analyze as many extant studies related to blockchain and supply chain as possible,
    we searched the IEEE Xplore, ACM, Google Scholar, and other major digital libraries
    from various academic publishers, using the following search string shown in Fig.
    1. In this study, literature search and screening involved the following steps
    (Fig. 1). FIGURE 1. Procedural steps of the selection protocol. Show All A. Step
    1: Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria Article selection was conducted by setting inclusion
    and exclusion criteria prior to analysis to extract highly-relevant literature.
    In this research, we focused on keywords related to the emerging blockchain technology
    and its extended concept, smart contracts, in the field of SCM to identify relevant
    articles. Considering the essence of blockchain, more general synonyms or terminologies,
    such as DLT and “decentralized ledger system” (DLS), were included. After employing
    these procedures, we obtained a total of 433 articles. Meanwhile, exclusion criteria
    were set to exclude ambiguous articles not highly correlated to the key topics.
    In this research, we included some conference articles and proceedings to extend
    the scope of literature. However, preliminary studies in the form of technical
    reports, comments, editorial, and consulting papers, were excluded to ensure quality,
    consistency, and academic rigor. B. Step 2: Title and Abstract Examination Based
    on the results of keywords identification and screening procedures, we examined
    the title and abstract of each selected article by each author. To assure quality
    and academic rigor, content of abstracts with less focus on major topics or with
    less concrete findings/contributions to the body of knowledge were removed. We
    double-checked our process to maintain coherence in article selection. In this
    stage, we excluded 294 papers that focused mainly on the applications of other
    emerging technologies such as the internet of things (IoT), cloud computing, industry
    4.0, machine to machine (M2M), and radio frequency identification (RFID), etc.
    C. Step 3: Full Text Reading and Finer Selection To better align the research
    questions with the contents of the selected papers, we conducted a full text reading
    and perform the procedure for finer selection of candidate papers. We removed
    33 papers from the selection as they were less relevant to our main focus. In
    this final step, we obtained 106 papers for this study. Fig. 1 illustrates the
    procedural steps for paper selection and presents the selection criteria or main
    actions conducted to filter for the most related articles. Additionally, to better
    comprehend of the selected corpus, we conducted a preliminary descriptive analysis
    to determine answers for the research questions. We classified the selected papers
    according to their topics and research methods to respond to RQ1 and RQ2. We also
    conducted a citation analysis to provide evidence for RQ3. A number of frequently-cited
    supply chain articles based on blockchain and smart contract technology were examined
    to obtain a better understanding of the research interest and its applications.
    The following sections provide explanations for the literature classification
    and related analyses. SECTION IV. Result A. Descriptive Analysis of the Corpus
    Fig. 2 displays the distribution of the sources of the selected review articles
    and illustrates the proliferation of blockchain research in the field of SCM in
    the last 3 years. This indicates the potential and opportunities for this emerging
    technology in various facets of supply-chain-related issues. Blockchain was coined
    and introduced around 2008, from then on, research has focused on cryptocurrencies,
    e.g., Bitcoin, along with their security and privacy issues. The development and
    evolution of such technologies have moved from their original financial applications
    to other areas in the following years. During the period 2008~2015, due to the
    technical essence of blockchain, related publications were scattered in the form
    of technical forums, consulting reports, news reviews, or comments. Since 2016,
    blockchain and its applications have drawn the attention of engineers, scholars,
    and practitioners. For example, the special topic conference entitled “The 2018
    international conference on blockchain” focused on the discussion of applications
    of blockchain technology and smart contracts in various sectors, including supply
    chains. FIGURE 2. Paper distribution by year of publication. Show All Assorted
    but fragmented peer-reviewed journals contributed around 89% of the selected articles,
    while IEEE, ACM and other topic-related conferences accounted for the rest. Fig.
    3 presents the popular journals for blockchain-related publications, which include
    IEEE Access, International Journal of Information Management, Future Generation
    Computer Systems, Supply Chain Management: An International Journal, International
    Journal of Production Research, Sustainability, Computers & Industrial Engineering,
    etc. Originally designed for solving the double spending issue of digital currency,
    blockchain applications were first used mainly in the financial sectors rather
    than others, such as supply chain, medical records, and information systems. Additionally,
    we discovered a growing demand for papers in 2018 and expect double or triple
    the amount of publications in 2019 and 2020. The growing numbers of conferences
    and special sections regarding blockchain-related supply chain publications in
    recent years have resulted in an increasing research interest in this field. Due
    to the proliferation of blockchain-related conferences held in recent years, we
    excluded conference papers from the year 2019, but selected a few frequently-cited
    conference papers for the literature analysis. FIGURE 3. Journal/conference publications
    and number of papers published. Show All B. Classification of Selected Papers
    To answer RQ1 and determine corresponding research methods for RQ2, we classified
    the selected papers in terms of supply-chain-centric topics to identify the research
    foci and examine the potential influence of and emphasis on blockchain in supply
    chain applications [47]. The classification of selected paper is presented in
    Table 1 with a brief description of related topics. A considerable number of papers
    covered traceability/transparency issues and the influence of blockchain technology
    in the supply chain context. Similar efforts highlighted the potential of blockchain-based
    supply chain applications in diverse sectors, prototype system design [48]–[50],
    and a combination of other emerging technologies. We noticed that each paper may
    have referred to more than one topic to better respond to the scope of the selected
    papers. TABLE 1 Article Topics Classification For better objectivity, we conducted
    a two-stage review for paper classification. We independently classified the selected
    papers into a grouping list. Next, we performed a cross examination to extract
    common opinions regarding research topics, finely adjusting for topic headings
    after the discussion. Subsequently, we conducted a random check using the previous
    classification to ensure less disagreement and to present more stable final decisions.
    Table 2 presents potential blockchain applications across different industries
    showing that early applications were mainly in the fields such as food provenance
    [51], physical distribution and logistics [52], manufacturing [53], [54], and
    drug/pharmaceuticals supplies [55]–[57]. Traceability [58] and transparency [59]
    issues are increasingly drawing more attention, and this phenomenon explains the
    penetration point where blockchain could be applied in SCM. We also found early
    evidence that these applications may cover various sectors such as the chemical
    [60], construction [61], [62], airline [63]–[65], and manufacturing [66], [67].
    TABLE 2 Topic Classification in Various Industries The most addressed topics were
    divided into four categories: (1) traceability and transparency, (2) general influence/overview,
    (3) blockchain applications in agriculture or other industries, and (4) physical
    distribution and logistics (Fig. 4). The results of our topical discussion were
    reasonable since the major focus of the research interest and proposed solutions
    began with the pursuit of major supply chain objectives. We also found complementary
    interactions with emerging technologies such as IoT [68], RFID [69], [70], [71],
    NFC, etc., which are considered critical to streamlining supply chain flows/activities
    and real-time response. FIGURE 4. Papers classified by topic. Show All C. Analysis
    of the Relevance of the Topics Over Time Blockchain-related studies can be chronically
    divided into four-year intervals to examine the evolution in research topics.
    In this sense, we could further illustrate the relevance of research topics through
    an evolutional timeline. Before 2016, blockchain discussions mainly focused on
    Bitcoin or other digital currencies. Therefore, technical applications of blockchain
    in SCM were not significantly investigated. Fig. 5 illustrates topic relevance
    over time with the gray area denoting new topics. In the first period (year 2016),
    only few papers were published, and as expected, supply chain traceability and
    transparency were the first topics discussed. A few applications focusing on agricultural
    products were presented as templates. In the second stage (year 2017), it was
    apparent that growing attention had been granted to the discussion of blockchain
    integration with other emerging technologies, general influence of blockchain,
    the essence/design of the ledger system and smart contracts, and security/privacy
    issues. Simultaneously, the focus on the previous stage’s research topics increased
    both in amount and in depth. More publications that explored traceability and
    transparency were presented and there was also a growing interest in practical
    applications among various industries. FIGURE 5. Topic relevance over time. Note:
    Grey background refers to new topics compared to previously listed ones. Show
    All In 2018, based on the extension of topics covered in the previous stage, academic
    efforts were increasingly devoted to blockchain security and privacy, distributed
    ledger technologies, and smart contracts. We also learned that blockchain applications
    in various sectors, e.g., manufacturing, were drawing more attention from technical
    engineers, practitioners, and scholars. Additionally, more papers in the four-year
    period investigated blockchain innovation from the perspective of business process
    reengineering (BPR). In 2019, an explosive interest in various topics, such as
    blockchain-enabled physical distribution and logistics [72], business process
    management, information sharing, business operations [73], [74], and risk analysis
    [75], [76], dramatically emerged. Specifically, empirical studies focusing on
    blockchain acceptance/adoption [77], [78] appeared to further provide evidence
    for previous technological forecasts, business models, and proto-concepts [79].
    D. Main Research Methodologies Employed and the Relationship With Main Topics
    We followed a similar method of topic grouping to classify research methodologies.
    Two classification lists were generated and then discussed to diminish disagreement
    in the final version (Fig. 6). FIGURE 6. Research methods adopted in the corpus.
    Show All Since blockchain is an emerging information technology, few studies utilized
    quantitative methods. Instead, we found more descriptive papers using case studies,
    proof of concept (POC), theory building, and literature reviews, etc. It should
    also be noted that there was a number of papers that explored blockchain’s technical
    issue by system design, code/algorithm analysis, and simulation. Table 3 summarizes
    the connection between research topics and methods. We observed that various methods
    were adopted when discussing blockchain applications. Since blockchain is in its
    early development phase, quantitative methods were rarely used in prior research.
    Few studies used questionnaires and interviews [80] to collect data for qualitative
    rather than quantitative analysis [18], [81]. TABLE 3 Topics and Methods Used
    in the Corpus Qualitative methods were widely used to describe, predict, and propose
    blockchain opportunities in the supply chain context while quantitative methods
    were utilized to evaluate or analyze the performance of various blockchain-based
    systems. Case studies and comparative analysis have frequently been used to explore
    the potential influence of blockchain-based supply chains, security and privacy,
    and applications in various sectors. Several of the selected papers, from a technical-oriented
    perspective, utilized a blockchain-based system design and proposed conceptual
    frameworks for future system implementation. Some papers included coding segments
    to enhance understanding, and experimental simulations to assess the performance
    of blockchain-based systems. Some authors developed questionnaires and conducted
    interviews to assess the influence, acceptance, and performance of improvements
    in supply chain traceability/transparency due to blockchain. Very few papers conducted
    literature reviews due to the lack of adequate relevant literature. Additionally,
    some papers focused on the validation and evaluation of prototypes while few paid
    attention to blockchain-supply-chain theory building. Thus, most research studies
    adopted system design, case studies, or descriptive analysis to verify the effectiveness
    and potential of innovative blockchain-supply-chain projects/systems and associated
    conceptual frameworks. E. Citation Analysis Table 4 summarizes 12 frequently-cited
    documents (10 journal articles and two conference papers) in the corpus. To answer
    RQ3, we selected several typically-cited papers, categorized them, and provided
    complementary research findings for them. This selected list offers an outline
    of related topics about how blockchain may be applied in supply chains. Earlier-published
    papers may have been cited more frequently compared to more recent publications.
    TABLE 4 List of Frequently Cited Documents in the Corpus Early research focused
    on the examination and prediction of blockchain-enabled improvements on supply
    chain traceability and transparency [82], [83]. For example, Tian [84], [85] developed
    frameworks combining blockchain with RFID and the IoT. These papers serve as references
    for other applications in various industries, especially the agricultural sector
    [86], [87], [88]. Later, research interests moved toward the discussion of blockchain
    system design [89], security and privacy issues [90]–[93], credit evaluation [94],
    and governance [95], [96]. Evidence from pilot studies has urged scholars to examine
    blockchain’s role in meeting SCM objectives [97]. Researchers have asserted that
    areas, such as extended visibility and traceability, supply chain digitalization
    and disintermediation, improved data security and smart contracts, are worthy
    of further study [19]. We suggest that a second-run SLR must be conducted to include
    more emerging research efforts regarding the various supply chain applications
    of blockchain. SECTION V. Discussion Blockchain, with its unique characteristics,
    has received growing attention from engineers, researchers, and practitioners
    in the last decade. Through a series of explorations and implementations of several
    pilot projects in various sectors, blockchain technology has found practical applications
    from both academic and practical perspectives [98]–[101]. To answer the research
    questions in this paper as well as provide a better understanding of future blockchain
    developments, we attempted to bridge the gap in extant knowledge regarding blockchain
    applications and future research work with the findings from our literature review.
    The major research issues for the achievement of supply chain objectives are elaborated
    and discussed as follows. A. Traceability and Transparency Traceability and transparency
    have long been critical issues in supply chain activities. Typical pain points
    include critical intermediaries, process hand-offs, over-centralized business
    operations, etc. Blockchain, as a distributed shared ledger technology, may help
    increase traceability and extend supply chain visibility by its consensus mechanism
    and shared ledger. Every single node participating on a blockchain platform collaboratively
    maintains and validates transaction records in the common ledger. The major players,
    including suppliers, manufacturers, shippers, distributors, and customers, have
    duplicated transactional records and access permission to monitor the progress
    of process flows [102]. These inherent characteristics greatly reduce the need
    for trusted centralized authorities, allowing for immutable transactions and improved
    efficiency in supply chain activities. From the results we reviewed, we can note
    that nascent blockchain-based supply chain studies focus on the discussion of
    its potential to improve traceability and transparency [103]. Industrial pilots
    such as Provenance, Walmart, and Everledger have illustrated the capability to
    improve the visibility of physical movement, asset transfer, and quality assurance.
    The integration of blockchain and emerging technologies, such as the IoT and advanced
    sensing technology, will enable improved real-time monitoring of logistics activities
    [104]. By introducing better disclosure of supply chain activities and improving
    accountability across supply chain players, blockchain may mitigate disputes among
    businesses. With its immutable attributes, the distributed ledger system also
    reduces the need for reconciliation among traditional siloed databases. In this
    sense, stakeholders may capture value and alleviate risks when conducting transactions.
    Moreover, smart contracts may facilitate process automation and provide better
    real-time monitoring of product/service visibility [105]. The design of smart
    contracts aims to achieve the functional demands of supply chain stakeholders.
    While trust is often weak among unfamiliar trading parties, blockchain may leverage
    its advantages to create value in supply chain activities. A blockchain ledger
    system may also provide authenticity verification of property or documents via
    digital signatures or other encrypted measures, which increases security and averts
    counterfeit [27], [71]. Enterprises may benefit from the reduced processing of
    paper-based documents as well save the considerable costs involved in tracking
    and obtaining proof of information authenticity. Accordingly, an improved supply
    chain working scheme with better traceability and transparency, less intermediation,
    and process automation is attainable when making blockchain transactions with
    counterparties. Moreover, blockchain’s distributed governance and transparency
    attributes may also provide solutions to malicious alterations in a centralized
    system. B. Stakeholder Involvement and Collaboration Joint participation of supply
    chain actors can enhance the overall performance of a blockchain ecosystem [106],
    [107]. From a systemic perspective, blockchain may leverage its potential through
    a large-scale collaboration of stakeholders as supply chain friction mainly stems
    from dispersed disconnection among parties [108]. However, blockchain may not
    be a panacea as certain challenges and barriers still remain in the further adoption
    of blockchain technology [109]–[111]. First, the willingness of supply chain stakeholders
    dominates the level of employment as blockchain-based architecture is still in
    its nascent stages. Some unsolved technical issues include transaction throughput,
    scalability, security and privacy, block capacity, and power consumption issues.
    Supply chain participants are accustomed to the trust mechanism supported by centralized
    authorities and have less confidence in the effectiveness of a distributed trustless
    paradigm. Cultural mindset and extant business processes need to be changed before
    blockchain adoption. Second, activities for business process redesign and migration
    need to be well planned. The successful establishment of a blockchain-based operating
    environment requires coordination among the legacy databases of various parties
    [75], [112]. Firms have to choose appropriate types of blockchain applications
    and scholars have reported several judging criteria for reference. For example,
    a private blockchain is suitable for an intra-organizational context as it has
    a higher level of centralization and security. Public blockchains are open to
    public participation without permission while a consortium blockchain provides
    mid-level of decentralization. Researchers have addressed the importance of establishing
    a governance model, considering blockchain configuration and operations among
    stakeholders. Additionally, information sharing and system interoperability are
    key concerns for blockchain architectural design [113], [114]. C. Supply Chain
    Integration and Digitalization Blockchain has the technical capability to play
    a critical role in information sharing [115], [116], value/property transfer,
    and trust provision [108]. The way in which supply chain partners achieve strategic
    and business objectives using blockchain technology relies on the integration
    of business processes with the type of blockchain employed. From a value-creation
    perspective, blockchain enables the incorporation of a new business model [117]
    with disruptive innovation [118] and different levels of disintermediation, which
    allows for better transparency, security, privacy, and becomes a driving force
    of cooperation among untrusted parties. Blockchain-based financial applications
    grant a dramatic reduction on transaction costs with re-engineered processes since
    a synchronized ledger may significantly enhance the level of overall efficiency
    [119]. For example, researchers have suggested a blockchain-based letter of credit
    process, which may greatly improve efficiency in global trade context [16], [37].
    Digitalization of physical properties and intelligence rights may be the next
    stage of development in blockchain application [19]. Digitalization allows the
    transfer of value across a distributed ledger system due to blockchain’s capability
    for maintaining data integrity [120], free from malicious tampering and cyber-attacks
    [121]. Blockchain networks could also facilitate the transmission of digitalized
    stakes [122] and provide validation of document authenticity, which can mitigate
    transactional disputes. Moreover, blockchain and smart contracts facilitate process
    flows and improve the efficiency of payment transfers and settlements. Smart contracts,
    serving as digitalized protocols, could enable the tracking of supply chain events
    and document flows, which can streamline business operations and facilitate the
    execution of business logic. Therefore, supply chain digitalization is expected
    to promote stakeholder involvement in achieving common objectives. D. Common Frameworks
    and Blockchain-Based Platforms In a blockchain-based platform, smart contracts
    play a crucial role in connecting business logic and process execution in supply
    chain activities. For example, event-driven mechanisms are widely adopted when
    designing smart contract communications [37], [123]. Programmable codes are utilized
    to allow triggers when supply chain activities change states. For example, smart
    contracts trigger corresponding notifications to supply chain stakeholders when
    certain preset conditions are met, such as goods arrival, payment received, or
    shipping documents approved. Trial pilots with a variety of blockchain platforms
    have been devoting efforts to realize the better performance of supply chain flows.
    Typical examples and platforms that have been widely adopted by financial organizations
    are Ethereum, Hyperledger, R3 Corda, Ripple, Wave, etc. Different rationales dominate
    blockchain-based architectural designs, and various blockchain applications in
    supply chain activities demand joint collaborations among participating actors
    [124]. The findings we reviewed show that blockchain system planning and design
    is scenario-oriented [125]. We may take international trade supply chain as an
    example to shed light on the selection criteria for blockchain type and platform.
    When oriented toward disclosing information to the general public, a public chain
    with permissionless accessibility is preferable to improve the visibility of front-end
    workflow. Ethereum provides public chain settings for supply chain customers to
    trace physical asset provenance, authenticity and logistics status [126]. Conversely,
    local trade dealing with internal processes, services, and transactions may require
    the adoption of a permissioned private chain. Hyperledger may deploy at enterprise
    private network for sensitive information sharing and exchange in trade context.
    In an international trade setting, a consortium chain deployed between public
    and private chains could leverage its mediating role to facilitate transaction
    validation and the governance structure of grouped stakeholders [37]. The dominant
    players in a consortium chain play predefined roles, and its semi-decentralized
    structure may facilitate business operations in preferred-access control and authority
    administration [127]. While R3 Corda, as a platform targeting financial applications,
    may support trade finance and with capability to administer agreements and contracts,
    Ripple focus on facilitating monetary and payment transactions among trade counterparties.
    Wave’s pilot demonstrates blockchain’s potential uses in electronic document submission
    which greatly result in huge reduction on transaction cost and document transmission.
    The aforementioned blockchain platforms are applicable to different supply chain
    use cases, and researchers may also conduct comparisons of industrial pilots to
    understand how their features help achieve supply chain objectives [128]. The
    formation of a common framework may orient the level of participation since the
    greatest concern for supply chain players is how the framework distributes value
    to each entity and what value does the business capture within the blockchain
    ecosystem. Interactions among stakeholders and the sustainability of blockchain
    networks are essential for future blockchain development [129]. For example, a
    consortium blockchain framework may predominantly allocate governance to a specific
    group of leading enterprises [130]. These players act as value distributors and
    may orient the operations of permission control, credit evaluation, and regulation
    design. Participating entities may comprise suppliers, distributors, public sectors,
    and financial service providers. A sound framework with an efficient value-distributed
    ecosystem can extend both the technical and social influence of a blockchain framework.
    E. Theoretical Contributions and Research Implications In this literature review,
    we reexamined recent blockchain studies in the SCM context. Several studies focus
    on the general fact that blockchain may disrupt traditional supply chain practices.
    Many studies adopted the perspective of transaction cost [131]. Blockchain, as
    a shared distributed ledger, has the potential to mitigate trust issues among
    stakeholders, which in turn could alleviate business frictions, improve the visibility
    of supply chain activities, as well as the significant manipulations of human-
    and paper-based administration. With blockchain’s digital ledger, participants
    can enjoy the timeliness of information transmission among entities. In this regard,
    enterprises can harvest this benefit by reducing the costs of information-related
    searching, bargaining, and policing [130]. Additionally, smart contracts can enhance
    the level of automation by facilitating the operation and execution of business
    processes, as seen in the system designs of the reviewed articles. Based on the
    principal agent theory, the use of smart contracts may improve the interactions
    and relations among supply chain participants, i.e., the principals and the agents
    in various value-chain-related industries. A collaborative framework, based on
    assorted blockchain platforms, can mitigate issues of information asymmetry through
    better control of contract execution and supervision. Blockchain-based business
    models in the supply chain ecosystem have been less discussed in the extant literature
    [132], while the need for holistic evaluation from supply chain practitioners
    remains strong. This phenomenon may be because blockchain development is still
    in a nascent stage and certain technical challenges remain unresolved. Based on
    the findings we reviewed, researchers have focused more on the improvement of
    disparate processes and business performance than the overall examinations of
    how blockchain adopters may derive economic gains from value creation and revenue
    strategies. Future research on managerial issues should address the perspective
    of resource allocation and network collaboration. This theoretical work may help
    analyze, elaborate, and forecast the impacts of blockchain in supply chain management.
    This paper has identified key research topics and the methodologies required to
    explore blockchain in the supply chain field. However, operational challenges
    such as how to determine whether blockchain adoption is required remain at the
    discretion of managers and practitioners. The use of blockchain should be carefully
    considered in terms of product (or service) characteristics, alternative surrounding
    technologies, and a firm’s supply chain strategies. As the challenges of migrating
    from a legacy system to blockchain-based applications may influence the adopter’s
    incentives, a careful consideration of implementation costs, technical limitations,
    barriers to entry, economic benefits, difficulties across multi-tier actors, and
    regulative compliance should be conducted before a final decision is made. In
    this study, Table 2 reports blockchain applications in potential industries while
    Table 3 summarizes the topics and methodologies adopted by researchers. The positioning
    of this research with its adopted methodologies contributes to the understanding
    of blockchain by providing an overview of blockchain research and highlighting
    the distribution of and gaps in extant literature. Only a few extant works of
    research have been devoted to large-scale adoption surveys from the perspectives
    of cost analysis, trade-off considerations, implementation difficulties, and relational
    impacts with supply chain actors. Work on blockchain’s impact on multi-tier networks
    and the diversity of implementation strategies in various business sectors is
    still scarce. This presents promising areas for future research. Academic researchers
    can devote their efforts on less-explored fields, while practitioners could conduct
    empirical studies to evaluate the effectiveness of blockchain-supply-chain adoption
    or implementation [133], [134]. Based on previous review studies, this work synthesizes
    and analyzes research contributions from recent published literature to highlight
    that blockchain can reform the traditional paradigm of supply chain operations
    and develop a more sustainable environment for the overall supply chain ecosystem
    [129], [135]. Finally, the call for supply chain incumbents to deliver blockchain
    promise based on its disruptive features may further harvest tangible benefits.
    More research efforts focusing on empirical evidence when adoption, technological
    usability, and solutions to business long-term uncertainties, are required to
    fill research gaps and guide managerial practices. SECTION VI. Conclusion and
    Future Work This article aimed to provide a systematic review and analysis of
    extant literature focusing on SCM from a blockchain and smart contract perspective.
    Efforts to use these emerging technologies to innovate supply chain applications
    have fragmented research into focusing on various topics. Research efforts are
    evolving from technological studies, prototype architecture design, to a rather
    diverse focus on industrial applications, managerial implications, and social
    impact. To date, we are conscious of the research motivation of not only the pursuit
    of specific supply chain objectives but also for more open collaborative networks,
    autonomy, and distributed governance. The main contribution of this study is a
    systematic review of extant studies and citation analysis to provide a better
    understanding about the trajectories and applications of such technologies. Nevertheless,
    future work must address several blockchain-related technical issues such as throughput,
    security, scalability, and interoperability. Similar efforts are limited and related
    quantitative study regarding these topics is still rare. More research work needs
    to address the diffusion of blockchain technology, BPR, and their managerial implications
    and social impact. Promising areas for blockchain applications and research include
    the logistics, medical, insurance, and public sectors. We expect this study to
    provide an overview of extant blockchain-related supply chain research and shed
    light on potential research gaps and directions for future works. Authors Figures

    1. Introduction\nApplications of blockchain technology to the supply chain enhance\
    \ trust among\nstakeholders and increase the sustainability of businesses [1].\
    \ Stakeholders of the supply\nchain include growers, processors, carriers, distributors,\
    \ retailers, customers, and regulators.\nThey do not know each other well. Centralized\
    \ systems integrating supply chains with\nRFID (Radio Frequency Identiﬁcation)\
    \ still have limitations in their transparency and\ninformation asymmetry among\
    \ stakeholders [2–4]. Private or permissioned blockchain\nlike Hyperledger Fabric\
    \ [5] is more suitable to the supply chain compared to the public\nblockchain\
    \ like Ethereum. Permissioned blockchain provides better alternatives to protect\n\
    privacy among stakeholders and does not need a resource-intensive and expensive\
    \ PoW\n(Proof of Work) consensus algorithm, contrary to Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\
    Food safety is a crucial social issue [6]. In general, food safety problems in\
    \ the supply\nchain result from the three factors of contamination, spoilage,\
    \ and compromise. Contamina-\ntion includes toxins, insects, bacteria, and viruses.\
    \ Spoilage is associated with temperature,\nhumidity, and expiration. Compromise\
    \ refers to tampering, misrepresentation, and substi-\ntution. Failures in food\
    \ safety management lead to distrust among stakeholders of the food\nsupply chain,\
    \ as well as consumers [7]. Permissioned blockchain has been mainly applied\n\
    to the food supply chain since 2018. What kind of characteristics of the blockchain-based\n\
    food supply chain bring distributed trust and user satisfaction? There have been\
    \ many\nstudies on distributed trust dealing with trust among nodes or entities\
    \ of a distributed\nnetwork by ensuring and enhancing security in distributed\
    \ computing systems [8,9] and\non distributed trust in the platform and sharing\
    \ economy applying blockchain [10–12].\nSustainability 2021, 13, 10980. https://doi.org/10.3390/su131910980\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability\nSustainability 2021, 13, 10980\n\
    2 of 15\nHowever, there were no empirical studies providing evidence on relationships\
    \ among\ncharacteristics of permissioned blockchains, trust in supply chains,\
    \ and user satisfaction.\nThe purpose of the present study is to examine determinants\
    \ of distributed trust in the\nblockchain-based food supply chain and test seven\
    \ hypotheses derived from the structural\nequation model integrating distributed\
    \ trust, its three determinants, and users’ satisfaction.\nTransparency, traceability,\
    \ and security are suggested as three determinants of distributed\ntrust in the\
    \ blockchain-based food supply chain. Data were collected from users of Chinese\n\
    ﬁrms employing blockchain-based food supply chains to validate the research model\
    \ and\ntest the seven hypotheses. The present study contributes to clarifying\
    \ the signiﬁcance of\ndistributed trust and suggesting the evidence of its role\
    \ in a sustainable food supply chain.\n2. Blockchain-Based Food Supply Chain\n\
    2.1. Three Characteristics of Blockchain-Based Food Supply Chain\nBlockchain is\
    \ one of the most promising technologies for innovating business ecosys-\ntems\
    \ in the supply chain. Blockchain enables secure, reliable, and efﬁcient distributed\n\
    management systems without a trusted third party, which is a core part of centralized\n\
    supply chain management [13]. There are vital components of blockchain technology\n\
    that enable secure, transparent, traceable, and sustainable supply chain management\
    \ as\nfollows [13].\n•\nDistributed peer-to-peer (P2P) network: Unstructured P2P\
    \ network using ﬂooding\nalgorithm and TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)/IP\
    \ (Internet Protocol).\n•\nPublic key cryptography (PKI) and hash algorithm: Elliptic\
    \ curve cryptography (ECC),\nSHA (Secure Hash Algorithm)-256 and SHA-3, and Merkle\
    \ tree or Merkle Patricia\nTree for verifying data integrity.\n•\nConsensus algorithm:\
    \ A method of consensus decision-making among participants\nwhich are nodes of\
    \ the blockchain network, where a new block, which is a set of valid\ntransactions\
    \ for a given time, is added to the existing blockchain. There are various\nconsensus\
    \ algorithms such as PoW, proof of stake (PoS), delegated proof of stake\n(DPoS),\
    \ Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT), and crash fault Tolerant (CFT) [14].\n•\nSmart\
    \ contract: a self-executing contract with the agreement of stakeholders in the\
    \ case\nof satisfying common contractual conditions written in computer codes\
    \ containing a\nset of rules. The smart contract, which is called a chaincode\
    \ in Hyperledger Fabric,\nplays an important role in ensuring distributed trust.\n\
    •\nDistributed ledger: Storage of transaction records that is consensually shared,\
    \ repli-\ncated, and synchronized among participants in a distributed network.\
    \ The distributed\nledger includes blockchain and smart contracts in Hyperledger\
    \ Fabric.\nThere are various blockchain platforms for supporting blockchain-based\
    \ applications\nsuch as OpenChain, Corda, Etherium, and Hyperledger. Hyperledger\
    \ Fabric is a promising\nplatform for building supply chain management systems.\
    \ Hyperledger Fabric is an open-\nsource and distributed ledger platform initiated\
    \ by Linux Foundation and a private or\npermissioned consortium blockchain network.\
    \ IBM Food Trust is a typical example of\nblockchain-based supply chain applications\
    \ in food safety management [7]. Walmart using\nIBM Hyperledger Fabric-based blockchain\
    \ has been applying the blockchain to food safety\nsince the implementation of\
    \ projects in Chain and the US [7].\nA participant or a stakeholder of a supply\
    \ chain is called a client in Hyperledger Fabric\nand writes an application or\
    \ a smart contract (called a chaincode in Hyperledger Fabric)\nof a transaction.\
    \ Participants (called endorsing peers in Hyperledger Fabric) execute and\nvalidate\
    \ the application and the smart contract. They (called ordering peers in Hyperledger\n\
    Fabric) reach consensus through voting via consensus algorithm (BFT or CFT in\
    \ Hyper-\nledger Fabric). The validated and committed transactions are added to\
    \ a new block and\nthe related ledger is updated. Any transactions added to a\
    \ block can never be modiﬁed\nor altered because all blocks are linked by using\
    \ a hash algorithm which is SHA-256 or\nSHA-3.\nSustainability 2021, 13, 10980\n\
    3 of 15\nAccording to [2], considerable advancement in supply chain management\
    \ has taken\nplace since the 1990s, which has resulted in integrating the supply\
    \ chain into enterprise\nresource planning (ERP). However, transparency and traceability\
    \ are still a big challenge, in\nparticular, with complex transactions. Transparency\
    \ and traceability are the critical factors\nrequired in improving the quality\
    \ of fresh foods [15]. A blockchain-based supply chain\nenhances transparency,\
    \ traceability, and security, compared to conventional supply chain\nsystems.\
    \ The three characteristics described in Table 1 contribute to building distributed\n\
    trust among stakeholders of the supply chain. The blockchain-based supply chain\
    \ is more\ntransparent than conventional systems in terms of openness, accessibility,\
    \ and visibility.\nBlockchain provides higher visibility and accessibility in\
    \ terms of information, inventory,\nand ﬁnancial ﬂows. The shared visibility of\
    \ transactions, their validation, and distributed\ngovernance enable a high level\
    \ of transparency. Stakeholders can track back, referring to\nwhere the food came\
    \ from, and trace forward to determine who it was sold to, as needing\nthe case\
    \ of provenance and recall. Real-time sensor data across the supply chain are\
    \ avail-\nable to each stakeholder through a connection with IoT devices [4,16].\
    \ The system based on\nblockchain brings a higher level of transparency and traceability\
    \ to all the stakeholders of\nthe food supply chain including regulators and auditors.\
    \ Distributed trust is not trust from\nthe trusted third parties of conventional\
    \ centralized systems but among stakeholders who\nare unknown to each other. Sustainability\
    \ assuring the 3Ps (people, planet, and proﬁt) and\nESG (environment, society,\
    \ and governance) is available from the blockchain-based supply\nchain because\
    \ all stakeholders share information about human rights, the environment,\nand\
    \ governance. They can also verify all related documents across the supply chain.\n\
    Table 1. Characteristics of the blockchain-based supply chain.\nCharacteristics\n\
    Overview of Enabling Technology\nSource\nTransparency and\nTraceability\n-\nAll\
    \ transactions, which were agreed upon by stakeholders through a consensus\nalgorithm,\
    \ are shared in a secure and immutable distributed ledger. Smart\ncontracts make\
    \ transactions traceable, transparent, and irreversible.\n-\nAll stakeholders\
    \ can conﬁrm and trace those who are responsible for products at\nany given time\
    \ because smart contracts record ownership rights depending on\ntheir changes\
    \ in the supply chain and are stored in the blockchain network.\n-\nIn particular,\
    \ a channel component of Hyperledger Fabric that the stakeholders of\na supply\
    \ chain can use to communicate with each other shows a validated ledger\nto the\
    \ relevant stakeholders of a blockchain. The channel enables eligible\nstakeholders\
    \ of a blockchain network to carry out transactions privately with each\nother\
    \ with a subset of other stakeholders.\n-\nBlockchain-based supply chain systems\
    \ with IoT (Internet of Things) devices\nimprove the tracing ability and visibility.\n\
    [4,16–18]\nSecurity\n-\nPKI and cryptography provide conﬁdentiality and privacy,\
    \ data integrity, and\nnon-repudiation services in a blockchain.\n-\nThe Membership\
    \ Service Provider (MSP) component of Hyperledger Fabric,\nwhich assumes the roles\
    \ of Certiﬁcation Authority (CA) based on PKI provides\nauthenticity service in\
    \ a blockchain network for protecting privacy. The channel of\nHyperledger Fabric\
    \ plays a role in protecting privacy among stakeholders.\n[17,18]\n2.2. A Survey\
    \ of Blockchain-Based Food Supply Chain in China\nChina has been facing a big\
    \ problem of fake and counterfeited food, and most Chinese\nfeel great anxiety\
    \ about food safety. Chinese ﬁrms implemented applications of blockchain\nto the\
    \ food supply chain for solving the problems of food safety. JD.com had collabo-\n\
    rated with IBM to apply blockchain to logistics areas since 2016. JD released\
    \ open-source\nblockchain systems called JD Chain in 2018. Over 1000 brands including\
    \ farmers, proces-\nsors, importers, and shippers participated in the blockchain\
    \ systems. Consumers scan QR\n(Quick Response) codes or use NFC (Near Field Communication)\
    \ with their mobile phones\nto track all the details of products at all stages\
    \ throughout the supply chain and check their\nauthenticity.\nSustainability 2021,\
    \ 13, 10980\n4 of 15\nIn 2016, Walmart launched two blockchain projects by partnering\
    \ with IBM. One is\npork import from China. The other is mango import from America\
    \ [7]. IBM developed a\nFood Trust system based on Hyperledger Fabric for improving\
    \ food supply chain manage-\nment. Walmart China collaborated with VeChain which\
    \ is a platform offering a blockchain\nas a service to ﬁrms to enhance food tracking,\
    \ traceability, and safety through the supply\nchain in 2019.\nIn 2018, a consortium\
    \ known as the Food Trust Framework, which is a system for\ntracing food based\
    \ on blockchain, was established for tracking food produced in China\nand applied\
    \ to imports from Australia and New Zealand (products such as ﬁsh oil from\nAustralia\
    \ and dairy from New Zealand) in 2018. Merchants of Taobao and Tmall can\nuse\
    \ blockchain systems to verify the authenticity of products. Consumers can scan\
    \ the\nQR codes of products with their mobile phones and get information about\
    \ the place\nof origin and transaction history. Regulators can also monitor the\
    \ supply chain. The\npurpose of the Food Trust system is to provide traceability\
    \ and transparency in the food\nsupply chain to stakeholders including growers,\
    \ processors, distributors, regulators, and\nconsumers. Recently, Alibaba globally\
    \ provided blockchain solutions of supply chain\nmanagement known as Alibaba Cloud\
    \ BaaS (Blockchain as a Service). The BaaS combines\ncloud computing services,\
    \ IoT, and blockchain solutions, which enables ﬁrms to build their\nown applications\
    \ to guarantee traceability and transparency of supply chain systems [19].\n3.\
    \ Research Model and Research Hypothesis\nDistributed trust refers to the belief\
    \ in the blockchain-based system, which enables\nstakeholders who do not know\
    \ each other well to trust through consensus among them\nwithout a third party\
    \ [10]. First, blockchain-based systems allow participants to securely\nshare\
    \ transaction information among them without a third party. Second, it is really\n\
    impossible to modify the transactions agreed upon by participants in the blockchain-based\n\
    system. Finally, trust among participants comes not from individual trustworthiness,\
    \ but\nthe distributed system itself enabled by blockchain technology and smart\
    \ contracts.\nAccording to the authors of [10], the three stages of trust consist\
    \ of local trust, insti-\ntutional trust, and distributed trust. Local trust is\
    \ related to trust based on one-to-one\ninteractions and personal reputation among\
    \ well-known people [10]. Institutional trust\ncomes from institutional mechanisms\
    \ ranging from reputations and brand images of the\nthird party to things like\
    \ insurance and contracts [10]. Distributed trust ﬂows through\nnetworks, marketplaces,\
    \ and platforms not from a single source like a third party, but\nacross a variety\
    \ of sources sharing responsibility by using blockchain technology and smart\n\
    contracts [20] (p. 1) asserted that “the inherited characteristics of the blockchain\
    \ enhance\ntrust through transparency and traceability within any transaction\
    \ of data, goods, and\nﬁnancial resources”. Blockchain provides the ability to\
    \ enhance transparency and traceabil-\nity in transactions to organizations and,\
    \ in turn, the increased transparency and traceability\npositively affect trust\
    \ in organizations positively [21,22]. Blockchain allowing transactions\nand relevant\
    \ data to be securely stored and veriﬁed without any trusted third parties\nenhances\
    \ trust among participants. The characteristics of blockchain include transparency,\n\
    traceability, and security [18].\nIn the presented study, distributed trust is\
    \ deﬁned as the degree to which supply\nchain stakeholders who do not know each\
    \ other well trust counterparts and transactions in\nthe blockchain-based food\
    \ supply chain. Transparency is deﬁned as the degree to which\nstakeholders of\
    \ a food supply chain believe that transactions and related information\nare transparent.\
    \ Traceability is the degree to which stakeholders of a food supply chain\nbelieve\
    \ that they can track and trace all information about a product’s origin, location,\n\
    and history of a speciﬁed item across the food supply chain to verify when and\
    \ where the\nitem was produced by whom. Security is deﬁned as the degree to which\
    \ stakeholders of a\nsupply chain perceive security services such as authentication,\
    \ conﬁdentiality, integrity,\nand non-repudiation from blockchain-based food supply\
    \ chain. The three dimensions of\nblockchain such as transparency, traceability,\
    \ and security are determinants of distributed\nSustainability 2021, 13, 10980\n\

    \ ability to know what is happening upstream in the sup-\nply chain and to communicate\
    \ this information among stakeholders across the supply\nchain [31]. A higher\
    \ level of transparency is associated with consumer’s willingness to pay\n2% to\
    \ 10% more for products through a transparent supply chain [31]. Transparency\
    \ is\ndirectly associated with the provision of information to reduce uncertainty\
    \ related to prod-\nucts or services [26]. Transparent information contributes\
    \ to reducing uncertainty in supply\nchain systems. According to [26], there exists\
    \ a signiﬁcant positive relationship between\ntransparency and trust. Blockchain\
    \ transparency has a positive signiﬁcant effect on supply\nchain performance [25].\
    \ Blockchain improves accessibility, visibility, accountability, and\ncooperation\
    \ for stakeholders in the food supply chain [32]. Accordingly, transparency is\
    \ an\nimportant determinant of trust and satisfaction. The present study posits\
    \ the following\nhypotheses:\nHypothesis 1 (H1). Transparency has a positive inﬂuence\
    \ on distributed trust in the blockchain-\nbased food supply chain.\nSustainability\
    \ 2021, 13, 10980\n6 of 15\nHypothesis 2 (H2). Transparency has a positive inﬂuence\
    \ on satisfaction in the blockchain-based\nfood supply chain.\nTraceability refers\
    \ to the ability to trace the origin, history, and location of an entity\nunder\
    \ consideration [24]. Ref [33] deﬁned traceability as the process by which ﬁrms\n\
    track materials and products and the conditions in which they were produced through\n\
    the supply chain. Blockchain lets stakeholders of the supply chain track the status\
    \ in\nreal time and monitor the quality of products or services in real time.\
    \ For example, a\nrefrigerated container equipped with IoT devices can record\
    \ any unsafe ﬂuctuations on\nthe blockchain [2]. Ref. [28] deﬁned blockchain traceability\
    \ as the ability to track and trace\nproducts and transaction documents including\
    \ bill of lading and shipping notiﬁcations\nalong the supply chain. Stakeholders\
    \ of the supply chain can track and validate the origin\nof food by using a digital\
    \ code with a digital signature [28]. An effective food traceability\nsystem is\
    \ an important tool not only to manage food quality and safety risks but also\
    \ to\npromote the development of effective food supply chain management [34].\
    \ Many food\nscandals and incidents have occurred in China. Traceability contributes\
    \ to achieving\nconsumer conﬁdence in the food industry and helps to build customers’\
    \ trust [27]. The\npresent study posits the following hypotheses:\nHypothesis\
    \ 3 (H3). Traceability has a positive inﬂuence on distributed trust in the blockchain-\n\
    based food supply chain.\nHypothesis 4 (H4). Traceability has a positive inﬂuence\
    \ on satisfaction in the blockchain-based\nfood supply chain.\nMany studies show\
    \ evidence of a signiﬁcant relationship between perceived security\nand consumers’\
    \ trust in e-commerce [35]. According to [23], the security of banking systems\n\
    has a signiﬁcant positive effect on customer satisfaction. Ref. [36] argued that\
    \ blockchain\nsecurity contributes to improving trust among trade partners through\
    \ in-depth interviews\nwith industry experts. According to a study [2] on transparent\
    \ and secure supply chains,\none of the core functions of a blockchain is to enable\
    \ an unlimited number of anonymous\nparties to transact securely with one another\
    \ without a central third party. Accordingly, a\ntransparent and secure supply\
    \ chain increases stakeholders’ trust in the food supply chain.\nBlockchain with\
    \ channel function like Hyperledger Fabric assures privacy protection by\nprohibiting\
    \ unauthorized participants’ access to some secret information in the food supply\n\
    chain. The present study posits the following hypotheses:\nHypothesis 5 (H5).\
    \ Security has a positive inﬂuence on distributed trust in the blockchain-based\n\
    food supply chain.\nHypothesis 6 (H6). Security has a positive inﬂuence on satisfaction\
    \ in the blockchain-based food\nsupply chain.\nThere have been many studies regarding\
    \ the relationship between trust and satis-\nfaction [37]. A study [37] regarding\
    \ corporate social responsibility of telecommunication\ncompanies argued that\
    \ customer satisfaction had a signiﬁcant positive effect on customer\ntrust. Ref.\
    \ [38] showed a signiﬁcant positive relationship between satisfaction and trust\n\
    in the Airbnb context. Ref. [39] investigated the effect of trust on life satisfaction\
    \ in the\ncontext of WeChat use in China. Trust in both individuals and institutions\
    \ has a signiﬁcant\npositive effect on life satisfaction [39].\nHypothesis 7 (H7).\

    \ Measurement and Sampling Design\nTable 3 shows the measurement items for the\
    \ ﬁve constructs in the proposed research\nmodel. A total of 28 question items\
    \ were developed by referring to previous studies [25,26].\nEach question item\
    \ was measured on a ﬁve-point Likert scale. The survey was conducted\nwith companies\
    \ using the blockchain-based food supply chain. One sample from each\ncompany\
    \ was collected. To reach users who are responsible for using a blockchain-based\n\
    food supply chain in their ﬁrms, the present study employed purposive sampling\
    \ and\nsnowball sampling methods. Purposive sampling is a non-probability sampling\
    \ method in\nwhich researchers rely on their own judgment when choosing samples.\
    \ Snowball sampling\nis also a non-probability sampling method in which researchers\
    \ recruit participants from\namong their acquaintances, and then, in turn, the\
    \ informants introduce new participants\nto researchers. The questionnaire was\
    \ published by using Wenjuanxing (www.wjx.ch\n(accessed on 5 November 2020)) which\
    \ is the most popular website for online surveys in\nChina and was sent out through\
    \ WeChat or email for online survey. Each questionnaire\nwas sent to supply chain\
    \ representatives who were members of the China Animal Health\nand Food Safety\
    \ Alliance (CAFA), which is a government-backed organization under the\nChinese\
    \ National Agricultural Science Technology Innovation Alliance. VeChain is one\
    \ of\nthe council members of CAFA. Excluding missing data, error responses, and\
    \ inadequate\nanswers, a total of 318 valid responses were used for the analyses.\n\

    of-ﬁt refers to the extent to which the structural equation model ﬁts the sample\

    \ is also used to validate the PLS model globally [49]. A\nGoF value of 0.500\
    \ in the research model exceeds the cut-off value of 0.36 [23]. Thus, the\nstructural\
    \ equation model provided a satisfactory ﬁt. The R-squared values of trust and\n\
    satisfaction were shown not to be unsatisfactory at 0.481 and 0.248, respectively\

    6. Conclusions\nBlockchain is an enabler of distributed transaction and management\
    \ instead of a\ncentralized approach with third parties. A variety of stakeholders\
    \ as actors of business\necosystems participate in the blockchain-based food supply\
    \ chain. Participants including\nproducers, processors, distributors, retailers,\
    \ consumers, and regulators want to have\ntransparent, traceable, and secure transactions.\
    \ Our ﬁndings suggest that transparency,\ntraceability, and security are determinants\
    \ of distributed trust in the food supply chain.\nTransparency has a signiﬁcant\
    \ inﬂuence on user satisfaction. In particular, distributed trust\nSustainability\
    \ 2021, 13, 10980\n12 of 15\nplays a mediating role in relationships between the\
    \ three determinants and satisfaction.\nTwo characteristics of blockchain technology,\
    \ traceability and security, indirectly affect user\nsatisfaction, although these\
    \ two variables do not directly inﬂuence it.\nBlockchain technology has been mainly\
    \ applied and diffusing in the areas of the\ncryptocurrency and ﬁnance industry\
    \ initiated by Bitcoin since 2009. Hyperledger began in\nDecember 2015 by the\
    \ Linux Foundation. Since 2008, companies such as IBM, Walmart,\nAlibaba, and\
    \ JD.com have launched solution services for food supply chain management\nuntil\
    \ 2018. Applications of blockchain to the supply chain are still in the initial\
    \ stages. Most\nof all studies have focused on technical approaches regarding\
    \ blockchain applications. The\npresent study can be a guide for future behavioral\
    \ studies for blockchain applications.\nThe present study contributes to the advancement\
    \ of research regarding trust-free\nsystems and the relationship between system-like\
    \ trust and human-like trust in technology.\nTrust in technology exists along\
    \ a continuum of technology’s humanness, which is repre-\nsented by the extent\
    \ to which users perceive it to be more human-like or systems-like [50].\nHuman-like\
    \ trust consists of integrity, ability, and benevolence, whereas system-like trust\n\
    includes reliability, functionality, and helpfulness. According to the authors\
    \ of [51,52],\nmore human-like technology such as Facebook and Airbnb is strongly\
    \ associated with\nusefulness and continuance intention, whereas more system-like\
    \ technologies like MS\nAccess and Expedia.com had a stronger inﬂuence on usefulness\
    \ and continuance intention.\nThe blockchain-based supply chain resembles the\
    \ system-like technology more than the\nhuman-like technology. Our ﬁndings imply\
    \ that three determinants of distributed trust,\nincluding transparency, traceability,\
    \ and security, improve trust in technology.\nThree papers deal with trust in\
    \ blockchain and trust-free issues [11,53,54]. Ref. [54] sug-\ngested multi-dimensions\
    \ of factors inﬂuencing trust in blockchain by using data collected\nfrom interviews\
    \ and applying grounded theory. Factors including security, technology\ndevelopment,\
    \ disintermediation, privacy, convenience, personal innovativeness, and eco-\n\
    nomic factors [53] were used to examine issues regarding trust-free systems based\
    \ on\nblockchain by applying a systematic literature review. Both studies focused\
    \ on Bitcoin and\npayment systems as application domains of blockchain. The authors\
    \ of [11] designed a\nsystem based on smart contracts of Ethereum, where smart\
    \ contracts play the role of escrow,\nmediating the interactions between forecasters\
    \ and requesters under online crowdsourcing\nsettings. The authors of [55] discussed\
    \ the limits of trust-free systems based on blockchain\ntechnology in the sharing\
    \ economy.\nBlockchain-based systems can be an alternative for solving distrust\
    \ problems result-\ning from human opportunistic behaviors, arbitrary judgments,\
    \ and mistakes without a\ntrusted third party. Trust-free systems can be designed\
    \ and implemented by applying\nblockchain and smart contracts to a speciﬁc scope\
    \ and within a given governance like a\nvending machine in a physical world. In\
    \ general, blockchain technology including smart\ncontracts contributes to trustworthy\
    \ systems enabling more transparent, traceable, and\nsecure transactions, and\
    \ also accelerates decentralized organizational structure and busi-\nness ecosystems.\
    \ Although blockchain can partially shift trust in people and institutions to\n\
    trust in technology in a speciﬁc domain, human roles as well as law and institutions,\
    \ are\nstill crucial to build trust in the blockchain-based supply chain for sustainable\
    \ businesses.\nIssues regarding the relationship between the trust-free system\
    \ and sustainability remain\nfor further research. In addition, further research\
    \ dealing with the relationship between\ndistributed trust and smart contracts\
    \ also needs to be followed. Our research model can be\napplied to many areas\
    \ related to trust based on blockchain. An empirical study regarding\nthe relation\
    \ of blockchain technology and sustainability is an important further research\n\
    area. OECD argues that blockchain is an enabler for sustainable services through\
    \ a case\nstudy in the areas of emissions certiﬁcate trading systems and contract\
    \ management sys-\ntems because transparency, security, and process efﬁciency\
    \ can be leveraged to drive the\nsystematic changes by providing sustainable infrastructure\

    in technology has caused an explosion in the number of devices connected to the
    Internet. Intel is projecting that the number of connected devices would reach
    200 billion by 2020 from the 2 billion devices in 2006 [1]. Also, according to
    Business Insiders, it is predicted that by 2020, 75% of vehicles will come with
    built-in Internet of Things (IoT) connectivity [2]. Therefore, with the unprecedented
    growth in the number of devices connected to the Internet, i.e., IoT, more and
    more challenges are emerging everyday. Nowadays, IoT applications are seen everywhere.
    In the last few years, many new terms associated with IoT has popped up, such
    as, but not limited to, smart health, smart cities, smart homes, smart transportation,
    smart agriculture and smart industry. Hence, the deployment of IoT systems will
    provide significant savings and revenues in many areas, in particular in providing
    monitoring and maintenance solutions. Therefore, this growth has forced businesses
    to adopt different strategies to cope with this exponential growth and the challenges
    associated with them, such as allocating sufficient spectrum bands in IoT applications.
    That includes transmission performance degeneration, spectrum scarcity, spectrum
    sharing, interference among devices, etc. Recently, the adaptation of Cognitive
    Radio Networks (CRNs) in IoT has shown equivalent or better performance than currently
    used networks such as Wi-Fi, WiMAX, Bluetooth, etc. Hence, opportunistic approaches
    for Radio Frequency (RF) spectrum control and management to optimize the scare
    spectrum resources is emerging as one of the main challenges. With the recent
    unprecedented increase of wireless communication systems, applications and their
    users limits spectrum resources and make connectivity between their interconnected
    objects a crucial task. Therefore, the demands for smart devices that can manage
    and configure its transmission parameters based on the spectrum availability in
    spatio-temporal dimensions are remarkably increased. Cognitive Radio (CR) is the
    best candidate technology; it is defined as an adaptive, intelligent radio and
    network technology that automatically detects available channels in a wireless
    spectrum and changes transmission parameters enabling more communications to run
    concurrently and also improves radio operating behavior [3]. The benefits of CR
    systems would be to [4]: relieve spectrum scarcity by broadcasting on unused spectrum
    and avoiding interference with primary licensee, avoid radio jamming and interference
    based on the selected Spectrum Sensing (SS) approach, support switch to power
    saving protocol, improve communication quality by using higher bandwidth services,
    and improve Quality of Service (QoS), since the availability, suitability and
    reliability will be enhanced. New spectrum resources can be gained by allowing
    non-licensee users, i. e., Secondary Users (SUs), to share a licensee users, i.e.,
    Primary User (PU), bands such that PUs should be always protected from SUs interference.
    Therefore, CR users must consider protecting the PUs over any other interest.
    There are three CR paradigms (i.e., schemes) by which a SU can share a PU’s spectrum
    band, these are: overlay, underlay and interweave. For overlay and underlay schemes,
    a SU can coexist with the PU without interference or with a minimum interference,
    since in underlay scheme transmission power of the SU should never exceed some
    limit, while in overlay scheme there is no such constraint; however, the SU should
    have a full knowledge about the PU’s signal, so that the SU can generate an orthogonal
    signal to the PU’s signal to eliminate interference. In the interweave scheme,
    a SU is allowed to transmit if and only if a PU is not utilizing its spectrum
    band; nevertheless, if the PU resumes its activity, the SU should leave the spectrum
    band by either switching to another band or by ceasing its activity if no vacancy
    exists. The CR works through a cognition cycle with four functional phases which
    are sensing, decision, sharing, and mobility. The cognition cycle begins with
    SS phase through which the available spectrum resources are detected over the
    selected spectrum band using different SS approaches. Based on the detection results,
    the decision is made to concurrently share the band, or to cease transmission
    in that band. Once a CR decides to exploit the band, a proper Medium Access Control
    (MAC) protocol is employed and power allocation should be considered to satisfy
    the PU protection. Finally, switching from band to another is performed through
    the mobility phase. This work initially discusses the main design factors of CR-based
    IoT systems. Moreover, the work reviews the most recent research works related
    to SS and spectrum sharing approaches, classifies the approaches, discusses their
    IoT applications, and introduces the criteria of selecting the most appropriate
    SS approach and MAC protocol for the CR-based IoT system. Furthermore, this work
    reviews and compares the applicable MAC protocols employed in this area. In addition,
    this work discusses the integration of emerging technologies with CR-based IoT
    systems. Finally, this work considers the challenges and possible future research
    directions and open issues. The contributions of this survey paper are: reviewing
    the recent existing works on the field of SS and sharing for CR-based IoT, discussing
    the design factors of CR-based IoT system and its main components, presenting
    and categorizing the SS approaches for IoT applications, identifying the main
    requirements for SS phase for IoT CR networks, developing the selection criteria
    of proper SS and sharing approaches for a proper CR-based IoT applications, discussing
    the integration of emerging technologies with CR-based IoT system, and providing
    the future research directions and challenges. A list of acronyms used throughout
    this paper is provided in Table 1, while the remaining part of this paper is organized
    as follows; Section II describes the recent related works, Section III discusses
    the design factors of CR-based IoT, Section IV presents CR-based IoT design flow,
    Section V discusses the integration of emerging technologies with CR-based IoT
    systems, Section VI addresses some future research directions and open issues,
    and finally, Section VII provides the conclusions. TABLE 1 List of the Acronyms
    and Their Definitions SECTION II. Related Works A limited number of papers surveyed
    CR-based IoT and have discussed this topic from different perspectives. The survey
    in [5] briefly discusses the principle of IoT technology; moreover, it describes
    how CR system works, its applications, and challenges of implementing CR system
    in reality. Despite that the survey mentions the possibility of incorporating
    CR and IoT for smart applications; it does not describe how to achieve this goal
    and challenges that might be faced. The authors in [6] classified IoT technologies
    based on their orientations. Furthermore, they described the types of enabling
    technologies for IoT and discuss the IoT applications. Moreover, the authors explained
    the importance of adding cognitive capabilities to the IoT device for smart purposes.
    In addition, the authors considered the challenges of adopting CR capabilities
    in IoT and the SS paradigms for CR-based IoT. The survey did not cover how to
    incorporate different types of SS approaches and their IoT applications; the benefits
    of employing CRNs for IoT applications were not discussed either. The basis of
    the CR-based IoT is thoroughly explained in [7] where the principles of adopting
    CR in IoT applications were explained, as well as, possible architectures and
    frameworks were described. Moreover, the survey classified the frameworks based
    on features such as context awareness, scalablity, configurability and volume
    of data. The survey also considered real-world scenarios of CR-based IoT systems
    and the challenges that might be faced. Finally, the survey summarized the open
    issues and future research directions for hardware design of CR-based IoT. Despite
    that the survey focused on the CR module and the possibility of employing it for
    adding cognitive capability to IoT devices; the survey did not cover how to share
    vacant spectrum bands and employed MAC protocol, how to select the appropriate
    SS approach and which class of SS (i.e., narrowband or wideband) fits for a specific
    IoT application. On the other hand, the authors in [8] developed a comprehensive
    survey on the employed frameworks for spectrum sharing in CR-based IoT. The survey
    also reviewed the existing schemes of SS and spectrum sharing, the challenges
    and issues that might be encountered in the real world applications. In addition,
    the authors of the survey presented a general architecture with four layers for
    spectrum sharing process in CR-based IoT. The four layers are sensing, spectrum
    allocation, transmission power optimization, and security. However, the authors
    did not focus on the suitability of each SS approach for IoT applications and
    the selection of the proper MAC protocol. Different architectures have been proposed
    to implement IoT systems. The survey in [9] discussed the structure of IoT element
    and provided a thorough analysis of the possible architectures of IoT. Moreover,
    the work in [10] focused on Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) IoT which is composed
    of four layers, namely: applications, service, networking and sensing layers.
    A recently published survey in [11] discussed SS approaches in CNRs and addresses
    the recent advances in this technology, its challenges and future research directions.
    The survey presented SS approaches as two main categories, wideband and narrowband.
    Moreover, it discussed many of the available techniques of each category providing
    comparisons in each category as well as applications. The survey was concluded
    by highlighting the open research challenge of tackling attacks targeting secure
    SS and sharing. Nevertheless, all above-mentioned surveys paved the track for
    motivating more research works to tackle those points which were not covered.
    Table 2 summarizes the strong points of each survey paper along with some remarks
    on each. TABLE 2 Remarks on the Published Survey Papers on CR-Based IoT SECTION
    III. Design Factors of CR-Based IoT Systems The main objective of using IoT systems
    is to connect numerous heterogeneous devices and systems together to provide some
    smart services with minimal device resource requirements, i.e., power, hardware
    complexity and cost, i.e., expenses. To achieve this objective, the connectivity
    between devices should always be maintained in all circumstances. This motivates
    us to focus on SS and spectrum sharing processes in CR-based IoT. The designer
    should carefully select a proper SS approach for the CR-based IoT device. Moreover,
    the designer should determine the spectrum band allocation precisely to satisfy
    the PU protection constraints when exploiting the vacant spectrum band. To achieve
    those two goals, the following factors have to be considered: IoT applications.
    Enabling technology. Regulations. Those design factors are used to determine the
    main characteristics of the CR-based IoT system, such as transmission range, transmission
    rate, Bandwidth (BW) occupancy, transmitted signal type, i.e., analog or digital,
    transmission nature, i.e., continuous or intermittent. Based on those characteristics,
    a designer can select the proper SS approach and MAC protocol as discussed in
    Section IV. For example, to design CR-based IoT enabling Narrowband-IoT (NB-IoT)
    technology, a designer should select one of the Narrowband Spectrum Sensing (NBSS)
    approaches, such as Energy Detector (ED), Cyclostationary Feature Detector (CFD),
    or Matched Filter (MF). Section IV-A provides more details about selecting the
    proper SS approach. From MAC protocol perspective, standard random MAC protocols,
    such as slotted ALOHA and Carrier Sense Multiple Access/ Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA)
    can be employed in such case [12], [13]. Figure 1 demonstrates the factors to
    be considered for designing a CR-based IoT system. Moreover, the figure shows
    the relationship between the design factors. FIGURE 1. Design factors of CR-based
    IoT system. Show All A. IoT Applications IoT has enormous applications. The applications
    are selected based on the type of the service to be provided. For instance, if
    IoT devices are used for medical purposes; the Wireless Medical Applications (WMA)
    are classified as Medical Implant Communications Services (MICS), Wireless Medical
    Telemetry Service (WMTS), Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs), Ultra Wideband
    (UWB), Radar Imaging (RI), and Telehealth [14]. The type of the application determines
    the nature of the signal to be transmitted (i.e., analog or digital), data size,
    time transmission, type of transmission (i.e., intermittent or continuous), frequency
    range and the standards to be employed. As an illustrative example, Table 3 displays
    the transmission requirements of some medical applications. TABLE 3 Transmission
    Parameters and Applicable SS Class for Some Medical Applications All above-mentioned
    medical applications must employ low power device with transmission power constraint
    of ≤ 0.75 mW; so that they do not pose any harm to a human body; moreover, the
    applications are allowed to use some portions of Industrial Scientific Medical
    (ISM) bands [14]. B. Enabling Technology IoT networks employ many different enabling
    technologies for establishing the communication between the devices in the network.

    WiFi, and Near Field Communication (NFC) are some of enabling technologies that
    IoT might use for communication. The enabling technologies can be classified as
    short range coverage technologies and long range coverage technologies. For instance,
    Bluetooth, RFID and NFC are classified as short range coverage technologies, while
    WSN, and Long Term Evolution (LTE) fall in the class of long range coverage technology.
    Figure 2 shows an illustrative example of IoT network connecting different technologies
    and standards. FIGURE 2. IoT Network with different technologies and standards.
    Show All The enabling technology specifically determines the data rate of the
    shared information, its bandwidth, transmission range, and operating frequency.
    Moreover, the standard and the MAC protocol must be selected to fit the application
    and the enabling technology. C. Regulations Every country has regulatory bodies
    and working groups which are responsible for imposing the regulations of frequency
    usage such as licences, allowable interference, and certificates [22]. Moreover,
    those bodies and groups determine the frequency assignment for licensed and unlicensed
    services and users. As an example, a CR system for e-health applications are allowed
    to operate on either unlicensed or licensed bands. Table 4 provides different
    regulations and applications for IoT adopting RFID technology in different countries.
    However, for some countries, it is important to satisfy an ElectroMagnetic Compliance
    (EMC) requirement. Therefore, certification of adopted wireless IoT device is
    necessary to meet their emission and susceptibility of ElectroMagnetic Interference
    (EMI). Moreover, the adopted standard determines whether the device needs certification
    or not. For instance, wireless medical device in Canada, under Radio Standard
    Specifications RSS-243 requires certification, while RSS 310 exempts those devices
    from certification. TABLE 4 IoT-RFID Parameters for Different Regulations From
    standard perspective, IoT use different standards such as ZigBee, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi,
    etc. Each standard is suitable for some applications. The suitability depends
    on the application’s parameters such as data rate, transmission range and whether
    the transmission is continuous or intermittent. Here are some examples: Bluetooth
    and ZigBee are suitable for low data rate applications that need long battery
    life and secured networking. More specifically, ZigBee is suited for intermittent
    transmission with data rate of 250 kbps, and its range reaches 20 m. Wi-Fi is
    suitable for applications with high date rate over Wireless Local Area Network
    (WLAN) platform, and its range reaches 35 to 40 m for indoor and outdoor, respectively.
    Furthermore, it is noticeable nowadays that most of IoT applications uses ISM
    band at 2.4 GHz, where various standards can be facilitated. However, there are
    some wireless IoT applications which employ 5 GHz WiFi and high-band cellular,
    while the low-power-long-range wireless IoT applications can employ TV White Space
    (TVWS), i.e., IEEE 802.22, in the band of 400 MHz to 700 MHz as in the United
    States [25]. In addition to the aforementioned factors; physical specifications
    such as weight, size, and power should also be taken into consideration when designing
    CR-based IoT devices, since the ultimate goal is to design low power constrained
    light weight CR-based IoT device with a compact size. Improving the energy efficiency
    of the devices is a vital research direction in this area, since most of IoT devices
    are battery power terminal with limited lifetime. Charging or replacing batteries
    is not a feasible issue, this fact necessitates determining other alternatives
    to prolong the battery’s lifetime. Energy harvesting techniques are among the
    best alternatives, and many research works have been done in this area [26]–[29].
    SECTION IV. CR-Based IoT System Design Flow Adding cognitive capability to IoT
    device means incorporating CR technology with IoT device, which can be realized
    through designing three consecutive functional phases as illustrated in Fig. 3.
    The functional phases are, namely, SS, spectrum sharing, and spectrum management.
    Details in each functional phase are provided below. FIGURE 3. CR-based IoT system
    design flow. Show All A. Spectrum Sensing Phase In SS component, a designer of
    CR-based IoT system must carefully select the adopted SS approach and the sensing
    decision making technique. This section highlights the selection criteria of SS
    approach and decision techniques. 1) SS Approach Selection The SS process can
    be performed either on narrowband or wideband levels. NBSS implies that the BW
    is lower than the coherence bandwidth. NBSS is performed when there is enough
    information about the PUs’ signal and BW. Many NBSS approaches have been developed
    in literature, including ED [30], [32]–[35], MF detection [31], [35]–[38], eigenvalue-based
    detection [35], [45]–[48], and CFD [35], [39]–[44], etc. Table 5 provides a general
    comparison between the different NBSS approaches. TABLE 5 General Remarks on NBSS
    Approaches In contrast, when the occupancy details of the PUs are unknown to the
    CR, WBSS provides better utilization of the frequency spectrum. However, the design
    and implementation of WBSS approaches are usually complex and consume more energy
    from high-rate Analog to Digital Converters (ADCs). Many WBSS approaches have
    been developed in literature, including Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-based detectors
    [49]–[51], filter-based detectors [52]–[54], wavelet detection [55], sequential
    scanning [56], compressive sensing [57]–[63] and multi-coset sensing [64]–[67].
    Table 6 provides a comparison between the different WBSS approaches. TABLE 6 General
    Remarks on WBSS Approaches NBSS approaches concentrate on exploiting the spectral
    opportunities over narrow frequency range; however, due to the large number of
    IoT devices connected to the Internet, CR in IoT will involve the exploitation
    of spectrum opportunities over a wide frequency range in order to achieve higher
    opportunistic throughput [50]. For example, to exploit spectrum opportunities
    in TV bands, WBSS approaches should be implemented. These intend to sense frequency
    bandwidth with higher coherence since NBSS approaches cannot be utilized for WBSS
    as these approaches make a single binary decision and cannot identify single channel
    occupancy state that lie within a wideband spectrum. In the same context, SS approaches
    can also be categorized as blind and knowledge aided based on the required knowledge
    for each approach. For instance, energy-based detection and eigenvalue-based detection
    approaches are categorized as blind spectrum sensing approaches as they need no
    prior knowledge about PU’s signal characteristics while matched filter and cyclostationary
    feature detector are among knowledge aided approaches since they require a full
    or partial prior knowledge about the PU’s signal [35]. Based on the above discussion,
    a CR-based IoT system detects the existence of the PU over a spectrum band of
    interest by adopting a SS approach. The designer can select a proper SS approach
    based on the design factors mentioned in Section III and the available awareness
    of the PU’s information such as BW occupancy and signal characteristics. The selected
    SS approach should satisfies the following selection criteria: it should able
    to detect the PU over the target BW, i.e., spectrum band, it should consume low
    power, i.e., energy efficient, and it should incur minimum computational complexity,
    if possible, As an example, for a SU that employs NB-IoT technology, an NBSS approach
    is selected. Then, based on prior knowledge about PU signal features, a designer
    can determine the most appropriate NBSS approach. Therefore, if the designer has
    no prior knowledge about the PU’s signal features, the ED is the best candidate
    for its simple implementation and low complexity requirement. However, if the
    designer is expecting that the system will experience a noisy radio environment,
    one of the eigenvalue-based detection approaches can be selected. Similarly, if
    the designer has some prior knowledge of the PU signal features, such as cyclic
    prefix or cyclic spectral correlation function; then a CFD is the optimal selection
    for this case, due to its noise and interference immunity. On the other hand,
    in case of WBAN enabling UWB technology, a multi-coset sensing approach is selected
    over the other WBSS approaches, such as wavelet detection or compressive sensing
    approaches, as no prior knowledge about the number of PUs, and sparsity assumption
    are required. In conclusion, the adopted SS approach is selected based on available
    knowledge about the BW occupancy and PU signal features. 2) Decision Making Techniques
    According to the SS observations, the decision is made to declare the presence
    or the absence of the PU over the band of interest. In other words, a single CR
    can make itself sensing decision, i.e., local observation. However, channel impairments,
    such as multi-path fading, shadowing and noise power variation, adversely impact
    the detection making of the CR, especially when using NBSS approaches [68]. Therefore,
    another decision making technique should be employed to improve the local observation.
    A collaboration between CRs by sharing their SS observations can effectively alleviate
    the impact of those impairments. The collaboration process is called Cooperative
    Spectrum Sensing (CSS) and can be implemented using three main techniques, they
    are centralized, non-centralized and relay-assisted. Discussing the CSS techniques
    is beyond the scope of this survey, however, a brief description of each technique
    is provided below. First, in the centralized CSS technique, all participant CRs
    detect PU over the designated spectrum band, then forwards their local observations
    to a central entity to determine the final decision about PU existence, next forwards
    back to all participants [69]–[71]. Second, in the non-centralized CSS technique,
    the participants share their local observations between each other and then the
    decision is made by reaching a consensus between the participants [72], [73].
    Finally, relay-assisted technique can be realized by two strategies either Amplify
    and Forward (AF), or Decode and Forward (DF). In AF strategy, once a participant
    CR receives a decision from another CR, it amplifies it and then forwards it to
    another CR, while in DF strategy, a CR decodes the received decision, remodulates
    it and forwards it to another CR [74], [75]. Excessive research works and surveys
    have focused on CSS techniques, methodologies and challenges [56], [76], [77].
    However, this survey paper mainly focuses on the recent works pertain to CR-based
    IoT systems. B. Spectrum Sharing Phase The objective of this functional phase
    is to allocate the vacant band and then utilize it effectively. In other words,
    an energy efficient scheme that avoids collision between SUs and PUs or SUs themselves
    is mandatory. Generally, spectrum sharing can be implemented through network selection,
    spectrum allocation, MAC protocol, power allocation, and spectrum routing and
    mobility. Once sensing decision is made over the designated bands, the SU should
    allocate the band to be used, this can be performed by selecting the suitable
    vacant PU band to be exploited and the way to access that band taking into consideration
    the channel constraints, such as maximum power and BW. For more understanding,
    spectrum sharing rules and models must be discussed before describing the selection
    of a suitable spectrum sharing approach. 1) Spectrum Sharing Rules for efficient
    spectrum sharing process, some rules should be taken into consideration which
    are: at any given instant, each SU can only use one allocated channel over all
    available channels, total interference caused by all SUs over the allocated channel
    must not exceed a maximum allowable limit of interference, and the allocated channel
    should match the SU’s requirements of BW and power. In other words, spectrum sharing
    process is a three step process; they are spectrum allocation, spectrum access,
    and power allocation. Briefly, spectrum allocation is to select the PU and the
    spectrum band among the vacant spectrum bands. Spectrum access is to select the
    MAC, routing, and mobility protocols. Finally, power allocation is to avoid or
    minimize the interference of SUs to the PUs. 2) Spectrum Sharing Models the spectrum
    sharing models can be classified into open sharing and managed sharing as shown
    in Fig. 4. In open access scheme, no central unit controls the access to the band
    to be used by the SUs. Thus, it is a unauthorized access model where a SU or a
    group of SUs can transmit data any time over some designated bands for short distance
    considering a power limited imposed by the regulatory body. For instance, Federal
    Communications Commission (FCC) allows ISM (2.4 GHz) for open access, but mandates
    that users should never exceed the imposed peak transmission power [78]. Note
    that, in this scheme the collision between SUs cannot be avoided, especially in
    areas crowded by IoT devices. Hence, IoT devices employ ZiGbee and WiFi standards,
    when no cognition capability is adopted [79]. FIGURE 4. Spectrum sharing models.
    Show All On the other hand, to avoid the collision between SUs themselves and
    between them and PUs, a managed access is employed, where a central entity or
    a policy is required to control and manage SUs’ access to a vacant band. The managed
    sharing techniques can be classified into three main classes, centralized, distributed
    and cooperation between PUs and SUs. First, in a centralized class a SU can attain
    an exclusive use to exploit a designated spectrum band through a legitimate spectrum
    management process such as TVWS Geolocation database and spectrum market. Therefore,
    a regularity body or a PU allows a specific SU to use that spectrum band for a
    certain time over a certain geographical area; as a result, no competition between
    SUs occur to use that spectrum band. For instance, if a SU employs geolocation
    capabilities, e.g., White Space DataBase (WSDB) governed by FCC in the US, provides
    the SU with a list of available spectrum bands and maximum allowable transmission
    power over those bands. The SU, i.e., White Space Devices (WSD), should never
    go over the imposed power limit [80]. Spectrum marketing between PUs and SUs is
    an emerging trend for sharing spectrum bands by either trading or leasing spectrum
    bands [81]. The goal beyond spectrum marketing is to maximize the spectrum efficiency
    by increasing the capacity of networks include PUs and SUs. In spectrum trading,
    negotiations between PUs and SUs might take place to exchange benefits, such that
    PUs might provide SUs an exclusive use for their spectrum band for a certain time
    over a specific geographical location for either forwarding PUs’ data to some
    area beyond their transmission range i.e., coverage area, or some fees. Different
    game models, auction mechanisms might be adopted to implement the contract model-based
    spectrum trading [82], [83]. In spectrum leasing, SUs might lease a specific spectrum
    band for a specific time interval to transmit their data over that spectrum band
    for a certain amount of money [81]. All those trades and leases should follow
    the regulations of government agencies in which spectrum marketing takes place
    [80], [81]. Second, distributed spectrum sharing models also can be categorized
    as either opportunistic, i.e., interweave or coexisting models. In interweave
    model, a SU can exploit the vacant band when PU is idle in one of these dimension
    time, frequency or geographical location. However, PU protection from the SU interference
    is a must; therefore, the SU should always detect the existence of the PU over
    the band during its transmission by adopting either Full Duplex (FD) by which
    a SU can sense and transmit simultaneously [84], or spectrum monitoring techniques
    for this purpose [85]. On the other hand, coexisting models are overlay, underlay
    or hybrid. In all these sharing models, a SU must be aware of PU’s signal characteristics
    so that the SU can simultaneously coexist with the PU over its spectrum band.
    More specifically, in overlay model, the awareness of PU’s signal, i.e., code,
    angle or polarization, enables the SU to transmit data without interfering PUs
    by changing code, angle of transmission or beam-forming [56]. In underlay model,
    the SUs can coexist with PUs in their spectrum bands. If SUs know the PU’s transmission
    power level, therefore, SUs can transmit data for a short range and never exceed
    a certain transmit power limit, while hybrid model is a combination of overlay
    and underlay model [8], [9]. Third, the cooperation between PUs and SUs can be
    implemented by either network coordination or spectrum relaying. In network coordination
    scheme it is assumed that there is a Central Network Operator (CNO) to coordinate
    and manage the spectrum sharing between SUs and PUs by minimizing the interference
    and optimizing the sharing time and power resources so that QoS of the SUs can
    be improved. The CNO selects the PU and SUs to be cooperated using Particle Swarm
    Optimization (PSO) or genetic algorithm [8]. In spectrum relaying, if a PU could
    not reach its throughput target, it asks SUs to cooperate by sending a Request
    To Cooperate (RTC) to the SUs. A SU with an interest to cooperate, replies by
    a confirmation message as Confirm To Cooperate (CTC). As an example, spectrum
    relaying based OFDM, SUs assist the PU using some of its sub-carriers to forward
    PU’s signal, such a scheme is called spectrum relaying. Channel power allocation
    technique, such as Water Filling (WF) algorithms [86], [87], is required to satisfy
    PU’s throughput target. Alternatively, various protocols have been devised to
    perform spectrum sharing based OFDM, where SUs assist the PU using some of its
    sub-carriers to forward PU’s signal, such a scheme is called spectrum relaying.
    Channel power allocation technique, i.e., resource optimization technique, such
    as WF algorithms [86], [87] and interior point method [88], are required to satisfy
    PU’s throughput target. Conventionally most of the SUs adopt Half Duplex (HD)
    relay, in other words, sensing and data transmission cannot be performed simultaneously;
    if the SU senses, no transmission occurs and vice versa. Such kind of system adversely
    impacts the spectrum efficiency. However, the spectrum efficiency of a SU can
    be significantly increased if a SU adopts a FD system [89]. However, this improvement
    comes at the expense of extra hardware complexity (e.g., extra antennas and electronics)
    and computational requirements. The selection of a proper spectrum sharing approach
    has to consider the following three phases which are: 3) Spectrum Allocation The
    spectrum allocation starts with network selection, i.e., PU selection, is an important
    step towards allocating spectrum bands. For SUs use NBSS approaches, the SU determines
    the PU channel before starting detection. However, in case of employing WBSS approaches,
    there always are more than one deployed PU network, i.e., PU transmitters and
    PU receivers. Many approaches can be employed to select the optimal PU network.
    PSO, genetic optimization and game theory are among the best approaches to be
    used for this purpose [8], [90]. Channel allocation is the second step of this
    functional phase, especially when there are multiple PUs and multiple SUs; by
    which each SU will select a designated spectrum band, i.e., channel, to exploit
    or to jointly share. The allocated spectrum band should fit the BW and QoS requirements
    fo the SU. Moreover, before transmitting data, SUs must be aware of the presence
    of other SUs intend to use that allocated channel, i.e., spectrum band, since
    SUs might use different spectrum bands but oblivious of each other. Learning about
    the existence of those intended SUs is known as channel rendezvous [91] and it
    is an important step to communication links between SUs,i.e., CRN configuration.
    The conventional rendezvous algorithms assume to use a Common Control Channel
    (CCC) to establish links between SUs and configure a CRN. However, a CCC is always
    influenced by the dynamic behavior of the PUs over the allocated spectrum band
    and is vulnerable to security threats, therefore, a channel rendezvous might fail
    [92]. For an efficient channel allocation using rendezvous algorithms, a Channel
    Hopping (CH) is adopted to enable SUs to reach a channel consensus within a finite
    number of hops. The most important performance metrics are Maximum Time To Rendezvous
    (MTTR), Expected Time To Rendezvous (ETTR) and Rendezvous Degree (RD). The MTTR
    is defined as the rendezvous latency in the worst case. The ETTR is defined as
    the average rendezvous latency before successfully rendezvous on at least one
    channel, while the RD is defined as the minimum percentage of distinct rendezvous
    channels to the number of common available channels between any pair of SUs. It
    is hoped that the rendezvous can spread out evenly over all common channels in
    order to overcome the vulnerability of one single rendezvous channel and provide
    more rendezvous opportunities [91]–[93]. The work in [79] employed the Round Ribbon
    Tournament to devise a novel asymmetric asynchronous channel hopping algorithm
    for IoT-based CRNs. The devised algorithm achieves guaranteed rendezvous within
    a predefined time. Moreover, the algorithm outperforms the works in [91], [93]
    in the degree of rendezvous. 4) Spectrum Access This phase employs MAC, routing
    and mobility protocols. After allocating the channels, accessing those channels
    can be performed by adopting an appropriate efficient MAC protocol. The designer
    should select a MAC protocol of CR based IoT based on two main criteria. First
    criterion is related to IoT system characteristics, such as data size, transmission
    rate, transmission range, power consumption, latency, employed communication technology,
    and heterogeneity of the systems, i.e., deployment of the system whether it is
    individual or back-haul connection. Second criterion is related to the detected
    spectrum band such as its availability and BW. More specifically, there are three
    factors that play an important role in selecting an energy efficient MAC protocol
    for IoT system. The factors are transmission probability, latency and power consumption.
    Hence, an efficient MAC protocol should incur low cost, low complexity and low
    energy consumption. Moreover, should have ability of channel switching while maintaining
    PU protection, low channel access delay, no collision between SUs when accessing
    the channel, and trades off between duty cycle and control overhead and balances
    between spectrum efficiency and energy efficiency. Finally, a MAC protocol must
    be able to correct errors, i.e., error correction. As an example, the work in
    [94] provides a comprehensive comparison between MAC approaches of two well-known
    standards, namely, IEEE 802.11ah and IEEE 802.15.4. The standards are adopted
    for IoT systems. The comparison shows that IEEE 802.11ah outperforms IEEE 802.15.4
    in data rate, data size, latency, and transmission range. Despite IEEE 802.14.5
    operates with less data rate and over a shorter range than IEEE 802.11ah, it outperforms
    IEEE 802.11ah in power consumption and network capacity since it can accommodate
    more IoT devices than IEEE 802.11ah. Different standard random access MAC protocols,
    such as slotted ALOHA and conventional CSMA/CA, CSMA/CA polling, Orthogonal Frequency
    Division Multiple Access (OFDMA), and Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS)
    have been employed by IoT systems to access the spectrum hole [80]. For instance,
    a CSMA/CA MAC protocol has been adopted in [13], while in [12] slotted ALOHA was
    adopted. The authors in [12] employed an ED as a sensing approach and slotted
    ALOHA protocol as a random access channel for its popularity in Global Mobile
    System (GMS) and LTE. Moreover, the authors derived a closed expression for the
    optimal throughput of narrow band CR-based IoT device with slotted ALOHA for local
    and CSS mechanism. The optimization problem was proposed to maximize the throughput
    of CR-based IoT under constraint of PU protection. However, the work considered
    the channel with only Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) and did not consider
    the impact of channel impairments on the performance of the ED, since ED is susceptible
    to dynamic environmental conditions and its performance significantly deteriorates
    under other channel impairments, such as multi-path fading, shadowing and noise
    uncertainty [35]. Moreover, the power consumption was not considered as well.
    On the other hand, some recent works employed non-standard random access MAC protocols.
    For instance, the work in [95] employed conditional interference distribution
    to propose a new cognitive random access mechanism with adaptive transmission
    probability. The transmission probability varies according to the measured interference
    by the IoT device. The proposed mechanism allows the IoT device to share the spectrum
    band used by the PU in non-interfering basis. Moreover, the proposed mechanism
    improves the area spectral efficiency and outperforms the convention ALOHA mechanism.
    Moreover, an energy efficient MAC protocol with a novel channel selection criterion
    was devised in [96]. The protocol significantly reduces the handshakes over control
    and data channels; therefore, improves the energy efficiency by increasing the
    throughput and minimizing the consumed energy. Moreover, the protocol was investigated
    by applying different PU activity models over the channel. Furthermore, the work
    in [97] modified the MAC protocol of IEEE802.11 in order to enable the protocol
    of opportunistically select the channel by adding channel selection algorithm.
    The modified IEEE802.11 outperforms the standard IEEE802.11 with sequential selection
    (i.e., Round Robin) and random channel (i.e., CSMA/CA) selection algorithms in
    both throughput and energy consumption. In addition, Restricted Access Window
    (RAW) is a promising MAC protocol which is adopted for low power IoT network for
    large number of devices with low collision probability. The RAW employs multiple
    equal time slot and allows a limited number of IoT devices to access a specific
    spectrum band at each time slot and spreads devices’ attempts over a long period
    of time to enable an efficient communication for a large number of devices. The
    devices operate in active mode only if their slot turns; otherwise, they operate
    in sleep mode to save power [94]. Besides MAC protocols, spectrum routing and
    mobility protocols are needed to firmly guarantee a PU protection, especially,
    if a PU suddenly resumes its transmission over the licensed spectrum band which
    is opportunistically exploited by a SU. In this case, the SU must leave the spectrum
    band without causing an interference to the PU by switching to another vacant
    spectrum band or immediately cease transmission until that spectrum band becomes
    idle. The band switching process is called spectrum mobility. To perform this
    process efficiently, the SU should be aware of PU activity pattern, in order to
    predict the PU’s behavior, therefore, it can alleviate a collision with the PU.
    Many approaches have been devised to perform an efficient spectrum mobility in
    CRNs. The works in [98], [99] thoroughly explained the principle, mechanism and
    merits of each spectrum mobility approach. The way of when and how a SU switches
    from spectrum band to another band is performed by spectrum routing protocols.
    Those protocols play an important role to significantly improve the spectrum efficiency
    by exploiting the PU’s time varying availability over its spectrum band [8]. A
    survey paper in [100] discussed the joint channel selection and routing from the
    perspective of CRNs. The work provided a comprehensive survey on routing and channel
    selection in CRNs. More specifically, the importance of joint channel selection
    and routing for CRNs. Moreover, the survey highlighted the classification and
    challenges of channel selection and routing strategies. Using the PU behavior
    models, performance metrics and routing metrics, the survey showed how to develop
    an efficient routing protocol. 5) Power Allocation The key aspect of spectrum
    sharing is to optimize the power and energy consumption in order to increase the
    overall spectrum and energy efficiencies of the CR-based IoT. Therefore, power
    allocation approaches have to be employed to realize this objective. Among those
    approaches, point interior approach [88], WF algorithm [86], [101], and game theory
    [90]. The point interior method is generally employed for linear and non-linear
    convex optimization problems. The method mainly approaches the optimal solution
    from the strict interior of the feasible region. On the other hand, the WF algorithms
    are used for radio resource allocation problem for a system with multi channels
    or carriers, where it aims to maximize the sum of data rates or the capacity of
    all channels in the system by optimizing the power distribution of the transmitted
    signals. For CRN, the WF algorithms are used to maximize the sum of throughput
    of all participant CR in the CRN considering their individual peak power constraint
    to guarantee the QoS of the PUs. On the other hand, in case of non-cooperative,
    i.e., a system with selfish CR, game theory is an appropriate tool to model those
    behaviors, since game theory provides the mathematical tools to study the complex
    interactions among interdependent rational players, i.e., selfish CRs, and to
    predict their possible strategies. Different non cooperative game models can be
    employed such as asymmetric Nash bargaining solution-based relay power allocation
    scheme which is used to achieve a balance between global network performance and
    user fairness. Stackelberg game is adopted to model the interaction between the
    relays and the users to find the optimal power allocation, and auction-based power
    allocation algorithms can be used for resource allocation among Device to Device
    (D2D) links reusing the same cellular channels subject to optimizing the system
    capacity [102], [103]. C. Spectrum Management Phase The popularity of IoT system
    encourages IoT users to exchange huge amount of data with their interested parties
    over public and untrusted networks. However, the data should not be exposed to
    every user since those data might be secure, safety critical, or contain private
    and sensitive information. Therefore, it is necessary to enforce security and
    privacy policies, i.e., protocols, to protect the data from any fraudulent acts
    or security threats. The complexity of selected protocol depends on the device
    specifications, networking, and applications [104]. For instance, most of the
    IoT devices are low energy, lightweight devices and use their energy mainly to
    execute their core function applications. This made traditional security algorithms
    not suitable for IoT since they consume much energy and incur high processing
    overhead. Hence, it is necessary to use lightweight energy efficient security
    protocols [105]. Many recent survey works [105]–[108] comprehended this area and
    discussed thoroughly the requirements, architectures, classifications and challenging
    issues for security and privacy protocols for various IoT systems and applications.
    However, in this work, a brief discussion on security and privacy is provided
    below. The discussion covers the important requirements and concepts in this field.
    1) Security To establish a secure IoT system with a large number of IoT devices,
    services and users, three important measures are required. Those measures are
    confidentiality, data integrity, and authentication. First, confidentiality guarantees
    the availability of the data for only the authorized users throughout the data
    exchange process. Data encryption is adopted to avoid the interference and eavesdropping
    of unauthorized users; in other words, strictly limiting the data accessibility
    and disclosure to the authorized users [106]. Second, data integrity is providing
    accurate data to the authorized users during data delivery over the network by
    filtering false data, i.e., tampered and forged data, caused by intended or unintended
    interference. Third, authentication is delivering the data to the legitimate object,
    i.e., a user, a device or an application, which requests a specific data over
    the network. Moreover, availability is an important feature in IoT system, which
    refers to persistent IoT connectivity by making data and devices always available
    when requested by the authorized users and avoid denial of service attack. Note
    that confidentiality, integrity and authentication are information security requirements
    while availability is a functional security requirement that also means continuing
    service provisioning during disruption conditions, i.e., the ability to provide
    a minimum level of service if a failure or power loss occurs [109]. 2) Privacy
    To prevent an adversary, i.e., undesired party, from discovering, eavesdropping
    or/and monitoring private information of other users and to ensure that data can
    be accessed and processed by only the pertinent user. Moreover, privacy allows
    the user to perform specific controls based on a specific portion of the received
    data while prevents it from reaching the rest of that data [110]. Privacy preservation
    mechanisms should be enforced during data collection, aggregation and mining phases
    to block data leakage to the public. Traditional encryption and key management
    mechanisms can be used as privacy mechanisms over data collection and mining phases,
    however, it is not the case for data aggregation phase, since data is aggregated
    and processed in various locations [111]. Despite that there are various attempts
    to tackle an efficient privacy mechanism for data aggregation such as perturbation-based
    privacy mechanisms and anonymity-based privacy mechanisms, this issue is still
    challenging and considered as an open research direction. In summary, for an efficient
    CR-based IoT system, it is recommended to employ lightweight security protocols
    and privacy mechanisms which need minimum communication and processing resources,
    and incur low computational overhead to support the resource constrained IoT devices.
    SECTION V. Integration of Emerging Technologies With CR-Based IoT Systems Integrating
    emerging technologies, such as blockchain and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques,
    i.e., Machine Learning (ML) approaches, with wireless systems is a new step towards
    creating next-generation wireless communication systems with additional capabilities
    such as robust security, autonomy, flexibility, and intelligent architecture.
    This section discusses the impact of adding blockchain and machine learning approaches
    to CR-based IoT systems. A. Blockchain-Enabled CR-Based IoT System The blockchain
    is defined as a tremendous, public, secure and decentralized datastore of ordered
    events, called blocks. Each block contains a timestamp and is linked to a previous
    block. The events can be updated by “only a majority of users” [112]. Erasing
    information is not allowed. The datastore is owned by no one, controlled by users
    and not ruled by any trusted third party or central regulatory instance. In fact,
    trust is encoded in the protocol and maintained by the community of users. The
    work in [113] presented a comprehensive survey on blockchain, its types, features,
    structures, protocols, and the integration of blockchain and IoT systems. On the
    other hand, the survey in [114] focused on blockchain applications and challenges
    for real world applications. Adopting blockchain technology is a promising solution
    to improve system immunity against hacking activities. The blockchain prevents
    central point system failure and cyber attack which results in improving the security
    in IoT and CRNs. The blockchain protocols employ a two-key encryption system,
    i.e., public and private keys; therefore, robustness is added to the security
    of CRNs [115], [116]. However, the use of blockchain in IoT security is limited
    and focused on the following areas: asymmetric and symmetric key management [117],
    [118], trading of collected data [119], [120], incontrovertible log of events,
    and management of access control to data [121]. The security issues related to
    IoT include authentication and authorization, ownership and identity relationships,
    governance of data and privacy [122]. Blockchain-based research has been used
    to tackle some of these issues. The work by Pureswaran and Brody investigated
    how blockchain contracts support the autonomous workflow and sharing of services
    among IoT devices [123]. IoT devices can benefit from blockchain networks in areas
    related to billing, shipping, e-trading, supply chain management, and energy trading
    [123]. In another work, Bahga and Madisetti proposed a blockchain-based framework
    for industrial IoT [124]. The work by Saghiri et. al proposed a framework for
    IoT based on cognitive systems and blockchain [125]. Such work is still in its
    infancy and worth investigating since introducing blockchain in IoT and CR systems
    shows a promising future in supporting secure data sharing and protecting privacy.
    On the other perspective, employing blockchain protocols in spectrum auction offers
    a decentralized validation which increases the accessibility of the CRNs and reduces
    the implementation complexity, since no central entity is required. In addition,
    blockchain-enabled spectrum access in CRN is a secure spectrum sharing approach
    where it provides an optimal collision-free method to access the spectrum opportunities.
    The work in [115] showed that blockchain-enabled spectrum access in CRN improves
    the security of the CRN and outperforms the conventional random MAC protocol in
    medium and severe radio conditions. The authors in [116] showed that adopting
    blockchain enhances security and performance of CRNs with moving CRs. As a novel
    step towards next-generation wireless networks to enable flexible and secure spectrum
    sharing, the authors in [126] proposed a secure and intelligent architecture with
    three planes, namely., user plane, edge plane and cloud plane, to empower 5G technology
    by integrating blockchain and AI techniques, i.e., Deep Reinforcement Learning
    (DRL). The blockchain is utilized to enable secure and flexible spectrum access
    and enhance privacy protection of the SUs; however, DRL is utilized to provide
    an intelligent resource management since AI techniques can tackle issues such
    as uncertainty, time variant, and complex features. B. Machine Learning-Enabled
    CR-Based IoT System ML approaches are AI applications that establish mathematical
    models based on observations, i.e., training data, to predict or make decisions.
    ML approaches enable systems to automatically learn and improve from experience
    without being explicitly programmed. In other words, ML approaches enable computers
    or processors to automatically learn without human intervention and to select
    actions accordingly. ML approaches have a potential ability to analyze and classify
    massive amounts of data which makes ML approaches as efficient and powerful tools
    for performing other processing tasks, such as data analysis, classification [127],
    feature detection, feature extraction [128] and identification [129]. Also, ML
    approaches improve the security and the data privacy for big data systems [130].
    In addition to the aforementioned advantages, ML approaches can apply complex
    techniques in a simple way, and provide accurate results of identifying the targets.
    Therefore, integrating ML approaches with cognitive capabilities can improve the
    effectiveness of processing large volumes of information from various distinctive
    resources. ML approaches have tremendous applications which cannot be covered
    in this section; however, some related applications of ML approaches to IoT and
    CR are addressed below: 1) IoT Health Applications The survey in [127] made an
    assessment for various ML approaches, such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest
    Neighbor (KNN), Naive Bayes (NB), Logistic Regression (LR), etc. In addition,
    the survey determined the criteria of selecting the most appropriate ML approach
    for IoT application. Moreover, the survey considered the application of ML approaches
    for developing IoT smart applications in a smart city as an illustrative example
    to discuss and address the challenges of adopting ML approaches in IoT data analytics
    of smart data traffic. Moreover, the work in [128] proposed a scalable IoT health
    monitoring framework which integrates IoT architecture with LR approach. The proposed
    framework employs 5G mobile networks for the transfer of clinical data into the
    clinical database to enable the necessary action for emergency situations. This
    framework is mainly used for early detection of heart diseases. In [131], the
    authors proposed a monitoring health framework that alarms when acute heart stress
    occurs. The proposed framework employed KNN and LR approaches to predict and detect
    heart stress and uses IoT devices to measure patient’s stress level. 2) CRN Applications
    The work in [132] provided a comprehensive review of various ML approaches applied
    to CRNs. The work categorized ML approaches into decision-making and feature classification.
    Decision-making is employed to determine policies and decision rules for CRs while
    feature classification is used to identify and classify different observation
    models. This work also addressed several challenging learning issues that arise
    in CRNs, in particular in non-Markovian environments and decentralized networks,
    and provided possible solutions. Furthermore, the work identified the conditions
    under which each ML approach can be used. On the other hand, the authors in [133]
    devised CSS algorithms for CRNs based on ML approaches. The SVM and KNN approaches
    were used as classifiers. The energy level estimated at each CR was used to establish
    the feature vector which is categorized using the classifier into two classes,
    idle channel, “no PU activity”, and busy channel, “at least one PU is active”.
    In this work, the proposed algorithms outperformed the traditional CSS techniques,
    i.e., hard and soft fusion techniques, for two reasons. First, ML approaches have
    a capability of implicitly learning the surrounding environment, i.e., topology
    of the PU and CRNs and the channel fading. Second, ML approaches optimize the
    decision region based on feature space which is better than the optimization used
    by the traditional CSS techniques. Moreover, ML approaches play an important role
    in constructing Radio Environment Map (REM) for their accurate prediction, classification
    and learning. The REM is an integrated database consisting of multi-domain information,
    i.e., temporal, spatial, spectrum sensing, etc., to supply CRs with a comprehensive
    radio environment information in their geographical locations [134]. In other
    words, REM is a global situation awareness system that helps CRs to make adaptations
    beyond their individual capabilities. Hence, using REM results in a improving
    detection performance of PUs and SUs, mitigating hidden terminal problem, and
    reducing CRN adaptation time. REMs utilize ML approaches to build a spatio-temporal
    model to predict spectrum usage, i.e., PUs’ activities, [135], to learn radio
    environment parameters [136], and to establish a feature-based detection system.
    The latter is used as an automatic modulation classifier for PU signals and to
    estimate model parameters of the REM [137]. SECTION VI. Challenges, Open Issues,
    and Future Research Directions A. IoT With 5G Technology (5G-IoT) Each new generation
    of wireless technology has brought faster, more reliable cellular and Internet
    connects, starting with the first generation of wireless technology providing
    cellular communication, then 2G providing secure communication i.e., voice and
    text, next 3G introduced the smart phone era and 4G/LTE offered high-speed Internet
    allowing for streaming videos. Currently, the future era of wireless technology
    is moving to 5G, a generation promising life changing innovation with higher bandwidths,
    faster speeds, lower latency and increased capacity allowing more people and devices
    to communicate with each other at the same time, i.e., IoT. 5G requires frequencies
    reaching 300 GHz, compared to LTE which operates at bands below 6 GHz, hence allowing
    for higher capacity and speeds. Despite 5G offering a significant increase in
    speed and bandwidth, its more limited range will require further infrastructure.
    The initial cost to build 5G networks is very expensive since it is a new technology
    and cannot be built on top of an existing network. Therefore, the concept behind
    IoT is predicated on a fast network that can link devices and services together.
    This will allow devices to connect in new ways such as vehicles, city infrastructures,
    appliances, telehealth, etc. In addition, the need for compatible mobile devices
    is a challenge that manufacturers must combat to allow for a global spread of
    this technology. In the last few decades, with each generation challenges have
    emerged and were tackled allowing each generation to move to the next and 5G is
    no exception. Therefore, the main challenges facing 5G-IoT include technical challenges,
    security assurance and privacy concerns, and standardization challenges [138],
    [139]. 1) Technical Challenges Though many research efforts have been made on
    5G-IoT, there are still many technical challenges that needs to be tackled: 5G-IoT
    architecture is the main challenge which needs to be addressed since architecture
    design still impose many challenges, including, scalability and network management,
    interoperability and heterogeneity, security assurance and privacy concerns [140]–[142].
    Wireless Software Defined Network (SDN) is a challenge for network scalability.
    Deployment of IoT applications is challenging due to its large scale, resource
    limited devices and heterogeneous environment; therefore, a multilevel and multidimensional
    service provision platform could be a solution to tackle these challenges an attempt
    is presented in [143]. D2D communication are expected to provide high throughput
    for 5G-IoT. In D2D, the energy and spectral efficiencies are the two challenges.
    Several other technical challenges include dense heterogeneous networks deployment
    in IoT, multiple access techniques for 5G, full-duplex transmission at the same
    time, etc. 2) Security Assurance and Privacy Concerns With faster data speeds
    and higher capacity, security and privacy is a challenge that needs to be tackled
    to secure user’s data. Therefore, new security capabilities at device and network
    levels need to address security and privacy in complex applications including
    smart city, smart networks, telehealth, etc. Moreover, the security and privacy
    factors that need to be considered in designing G5-IoT systems include intrusion
    software, security assurance, backward compatibility, authentication, key management,
    etc [139], [142]. 3) Standardization Issues 5G-IoT is a very complex system, its
    purpose is to connect humans to their surrounding environment, hence due to the
    diversity nature of networks and devices in 5G-IoT, there is a lack of consistency
    and standardization for both IoT systems and applications. Therefore, the main
    standards which are of concern in 5G enabled IoT are: technology and regulatory
    standards. Technology standards include wireless communication, network protocols,
    data aggregation standards; and regulatory standards, include security and privacy
    of data, security solutions, cryptographic primitives. Finally, investigating
    IoT as a service could be the solution for future standardization [139], [144],
    [145]. B. Big Data Management The collected IoT data are streams of huge data
    volumes from various resources with different formats and patterns. IoT data analysis
    and management are important data processing steps towards converting the collected
    data to a useful knowledge that enables an IoT device to make decisions automatically.
    In other words, IoT devices can automatically extract hidden information from
    the collected IoT data and take the most appropriate action through data analysis
    and management. Data classification, clustering, patterning and feature extraction
    are the key functional components of data analysis and management. Data mining
    is the promising technology to perform data analysis and management, since data
    mining technology can extract knowledge from a large scale of data, i.e., big
    data, [146]. The discussion of data mining algorithms and architectures is beyond
    the scope of this survey; however, the surveys in [146]–[148] provided thorough
    overviews on the data mining algorithms, architectures and their challenges for
    IoT. Data management challenges for IoT has seen to be emerging rapidly and no
    doubt with the use of IoT in CRN more and more data is being created. The data
    does not only include traditional data, but also streaming data generated from
    digital sensors from many devices connected to the Internet. The data is usually
    generated in both structured, which is organized and easy to analyze, and unstructured,
    i.e., images and video data, which needs advanced tools to analyze. Therefore,
    advanced data mining techniques are needed to mine streaming data from sensor
    networks. The challenge lies in the shortage of skilled data analysts and the
    need for more research to develop and implement advanced mining tools to mine
    streaming data from CRN and sensor networks [149]. The IoT e-Health envisions
    a seamless connectivity that spans over physical locations; therefore, several
    research challenges related to data management must be overcome in order to achieve
    this. The main challenge is the continuous change of state of data collected from
    the attached sensors on human bodies, i.e., data continuously transmitted and
    collected via the Fog computing nodes [150], hence the IoT e-Health systems has
    to handle the complexity of the data in terms of their variety, volume and velocity.
    Since, the data produced in different formats is application dependent and is
    a challenge that manufacturers or health organizations must tackle by setting
    standards. In addition, Fog admins are needed to monitor the capabilities of Fog
    node hardware and mange the data communication between different medical devices.
    In [150], [151], the challenge of receiving knowledge from big data analysis to
    acquire a valuable decision and big data security issues in healthcare is discussed
    and a proposed solution in [151], [152] is to implement an IoT Fog computing architecture
    which will process, and store data acquired from sensors. The architecture consists
    of two parts: Meta Fog-Redirection and Grouping and Choosing architecture. The
    deployment of large-scale wireless sensors and IoT, can result in extremely huge
    data and hence optimized data processing and hierarchical communication solutions
    are needed to manage such deployments and data processing networks. More research
    work is needed for big data spatial processing specifically for wireless networking
    applications, as more scalable algorithms are required for performing different
    tasks, such as system identification, anomaly detection, and similar problems
    [153]. Moreover, from CR perspective, establishing a comprehensive spectrum modeling,
    accurate spectrum prediction, and flexible spectrum management necessitates the
    employment of big spectrum data techniques. Big spectrum data provides a comprehensive
    knowledge about the existing PUs over a designated geographical location, such
    as PU presence status, received signal strength, signal features, etc [154]. Geolocation
    database, REM and Spectrum Sensing as a Service (S2aaS) are spectrum aware systems
    where a big data architecture takes place in CRNs. A SU can obtain accurate spatio-temporal
    spectrum availability and spectrum prediction from those systems [154]–[156].
    On the other hand, development of an energy efficient and cost-effective big data
    architecture is still facing many challenges. Some of those challenges are: determining
    the volume of required spectrum data for a specific scale, since the volume of
    spectrum data increases by increasing the time duration, frequency band, spatial
    scale of interest, and resolution. Therefore, extra computational power is required
    which results in extra computational burden and latency. As a solution, the use
    of parallel and distributed computing can help alleviating such a problem; however,
    the configuration and maintenance of the parallel and distributed computing are
    still challenging and requires more investigation. alleviating the deterioration
    of the quality of collected spectrum data caused by ambient radio conditions can
    be solved by adopting an appropriate radio propagation model. This challenge is
    more complicated in scenarios that include moving spectrum data collectors. increasing
    the processing and networking capabilities of the adopted big data architecture
    with low overhead can efficiently increase the number of the data users, i.e.,
    SUs. C. IoT Mobility The application of IoT in vehicular environments or moving
    wireless communication system is a new research area, since mobility is a prominent
    characteristic pertinent to the vehicular environment. Numerous problems and challenges
    still require further investigations and need robust solutions. Despite that mobility
    of a CR improves the sensing performance of the moving CR [157]–[159], the handoff
    process of a moving IoT device from one network to another incurs extra computational
    burden to the network coordinator units. On the other hand, the mobility of IoT
    devices adversely impacts the security and privacy of the network, where mobility
    creates uncontrolled environment by merging and leaving of an unexpected IoT device
    to/from IoT networks. This seriously affects the scalability of the networks and
    their connectivity. Consequently, the privacy and resilience are significantly
    impacted because those measures mainly connected to the scalability of the networks
    [107], [111], [160]. In addition, mobility impacts the security, identity management,
    privacy, trust and resilience of IoT networks. The challenge becomes more complicated
    as heterogeneity of IoT devices increases; therefore, developing resilient security
    approaches becomes a demand [107], [110]. Moreover, developing an automatic trust
    computing platform, i.e., automatic trust management, to investigate the trustworthiness
    of emerging IoT device to the IoT networks is another challenge and future research
    direction. D. Global Standards Standardization bodies exert tremendous efforts
    to develop standards for IoT and CRN independently. The work in [7] summarizes
    the standardization efforts for both IoT systems and CRN individually. However,
    the need to bring CR-based IoT into the reality becomes imperative. Therefore,
    some working groups and standardization bodies have developed some standardization
    efforts for CR-based IoT system, for instance, Third Generation Partnership Project
    (3GPP) has completed a standard for NarrowBand IoT (NB-IoT) using short range
    wireless technologies, such as RFID and NFC. Moreover, the work is still going
    on in developing a standard for IoT using 5G technology and Low Power Wide Area
    (LPWA) network connections [161]. The huge growth of IoT devices and applications,
    besides the upgrading the communication protocols, made the need to globalize
    standards a necessary issue. Hence, there exists no global standard for all different
    IoT devices, since different IoT devices adopt different wireless networks and
    standards. Moreover, data sharing between various IoT devices might lead to decrease
    the required level of security and privacy of communications. Furthermore, quality,
    reliability and transmission rate for remote IoT applications, such as telehealth
    over rural regions, are adversely impacted [14], [162]. Globalizing the standards
    is still a challenging task for the following factors various regulations that
    impose their own constraints, regularity assignments and recommendations on the
    standardization, as described in Section III-C, diversity of employed IoT devices,
    communication technologies, and protocols, which leads to difficulties in comprising
    and tackling all different requirements, especially with the rapid development
    in communication technologies and protocols and deployment scales, since the congestion
    and interference requirements for data transfer over large scale networks do not
    match those requirements for small scale networks. Besides, data privacy and security
    measures differ according to the deployment scale. Finally, developing a global
    standard that comprises all aforementioned factors opens the door for a new future
    research direction in CR-based IoT evolution. SECTION VII. Conclusions The demand
    for smart and CRN enabled IoT systems is ever increasing to perceive the ambient
    radio conditions, analyze RF spectrum and make decisions how, when and where to
    transmit. This demand led to extensive research on designing CR-based IoT systems
    as typical paradigm for smart IoT systems by incorporating the cognition capabilities
    of CR. This survey has provided the existing frameworks of CR-based IoT systems,
    explored the recent SS and spectrum sharing approaches and highlighted the advantages
    and disadvantages of each approach. Moreover, the survey has identified the essential
    requirements of constructing CR-based IoT systems and highlighted the design factors.
    Furthermore, the elements of cognition cycle of CR-based IoT systems has been
    presented and discussed. In addition, the main focus of this survey has been on
    SS and spectrum sharing, since it has developed the criteria of selecting a suitable
    SS approach and MAC protocol for a proper CR-based IoT application. Also, this
    survey has explored and showed the benefits of integrating some emerging technologies,
    such as blockchain and ML approaches, with the CR-based IoT systems. Finally,
    this survey has addressed and highlighted some challenges, future research directions
    and open issues in designing CR-based IoT systems. Authors Figures References

    Groundbreakingly, blockchain technology (BCT) has gained widespread acceptance
    and importance in the last few years. Implemented in different areas of applications
    such as social and legal industries, finance, smart property, and supply chain
    networks. This technology assures immutability and integrity of data without the
    need of a third trusted party. Furthermore, BCT could guarantee a transparent
    and decentralized transaction system in businesses and industries. Even though
    general research has been done in the BCT, however, there is a lack of systematic
    analysis on current research challenges regarding how BCT is effectively applicable
    in supply chain management (SCM). A systematic literature review (SLR) of SCM
    based on blockchain does not exist yet. This work aims to explore and analyse
    the state-ofthe-art on the BCT applications for SCM. We synthesize existing evidence,
    and identify gaps, available in the literature. The survey uses a systematic mapping

    Abstract In the past few years, blockchain, the underlying technology of Bitcoin,
    has received considerable attention from academia and industry. It is widely accepted
    that blockchain technology causes disruptive changes in supply chain operations
    that can overcome supply chain difficulties encountered in realizing information
    sharing, maintaining traceability in the entire process and improving operational
    efficiency. However, the application of blockchain technology in the supply chain
    field is still in its infancy, which limits an understanding of its potential.
    This article uses descriptive and content analysis to review publications related
    to blockchain-based supply chains between 2017 and 2020 inclusive. To fully explore
    research on blockchain-based supply chains, four well-designed questions are proposed
    and addressed, namely, the value of blockchain in supply chains, the attraction
    of scholars to particular supply chain themes, the development of research methodologies
    and illustration types in adopting blockchain in supply chains, and the types
    of industries involved in blockchain-based supply chains. The results reveal that
    there is growing interest in applying blockchain technology to supply chain operations.
    A detailed analysis of findings is provided to identify the future opportunities
    of blockchain-based supply chains, including prospects for tertiary industries
    and concerted efforts that are necessary to explore sustainability themes. This
    article provides valuable information to help scholars and practitioners better
    determine the relevant research topics to accelerate the development of blockchain-based
    supply chains. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Supply
    chainBlockchainDescriptive and content analysisLiterature review 1. Introduction
    In 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto published his study on “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic
    Cash System”, in which a peer-to-peer (P2P) electronic cash system was proposed
    (Nakamoto, 2008). This system allowed payments to be directly initiated by one
    party and sent to the other without a third-party financial institution (Rana
    et al., 2019). In recent years, with increasing attention to digital cryptocurrencies
    such as Bitcoin, scholars have gradually realized the important role of blockchain,
    which is a crucial underlying technology of Bitcoin (Kumar et al., 2020, Nawari
    and Ravindran, 2019). Blockchain technology is a distribution database in which
    the use of cryptography technology guarantees that the distributed ledger cannot
    be changed, and smart contracts composed of script code enable transactions to
    be automatically executed (Juma et al., 2019, Kshetri, 2018). Currently, the application
    of blockchain technology is mainly concentrated in the financial field, but it
    also leads to disruptive changes in non-financial fields, such as e-commerce,
    e-government, credit evaluation and supply chains (Allen et al., 2019, Hald and
    Kinra, 2019, Juma et al., 2019). Supply chain management is a comprehensive management
    problem involving information flow, capital flow, logistics and business flow
    that establishes a dynamic collaborative relationship between suppliers, manufacturers,
    retailers and end users (Mou et al., 2018). There are several problems with current
    supply chain management. First, supply chain information is isolated within an
    enterprise, which leads to information silos (Jiang & Ke, 2019). Upstream and
    downstream enterprises expand the information, causing a bullwhip effect (Jeong
    & Hong, 2019). Second, the opacity of information in the supply chain reduces
    the trust between parties and hinders the exchange of real information (Jia et
    al., 2020). Third, product tracking is difficult, and particular difficulties
    arise in finding the source of the problem when counterfeit and inferior products
    appear (Zhang & Guin, 2020). Blockchain technology is very suitable for solving
    these challenges faced by the supply chain since it can ensure the authenticity
    and traceability of information during transmission and the security of transactions
    in a distrusted environment (Helo and Hao, 2019, Tijan et al., 2019). These characteristics
    have a substantial impact on supply chain management and affect the design, organization,
    and operations of the supply chain (Hald and Kinra, 2019, Kamble et al., 2019).
    Some scholars conducted studies on the blockchain-based supply chain to explore
    the potential of blockchain. For example, Wang et al. (2019) conducted a literature
    review to determine the value of blockchain for supply chain management in four
    areas that encompassed: extended visibility and traceability, supply chain digitalization
    and disintermediation, improved data security and smart contracts. Philipp et
    al. (2019) identified potential applications of smart contracts in multinational
    and multi-mode supply chains through expert interviews and case studies. Even
    if there are some related studies, it should be clearly recognized that these
    types of studies are still in the early stages, and related academic articles
    are not fruitful (Pournader et al., 2020). In addition to academic publications,
    industry is also exploring the application of blockchain in supply chains. In
    the food industry, Wal-Mart has established a traceability system for mangoes
    that improves food traceability and shortens the traceability time of mangoes
    from farm to store from the original seven days to the current two seconds (Wong
    et al., 2020). In the trade industry, Maersk and IBM cooperated to use blockchain
    technology to solve problems in cross-border supply chains because it increases
    information transparency and realizes information sharing among trading partners
    (Chang et al., 2020). Despite the aforementioned academic and practical concerns,
    the understanding of the impact of blockchain technology on supply chains is still
    limited. To better understand the value of blockchain, identify the current research
    content, and determine a research agenda for the future, this article reviews
    publications related to blockchain-based supply chains. Some articles have carried
    out literature reviews about blockchain-based supply chains, and the articles
    reviewed here are presented in Table 1: five articles focused on food supply chains
    (Antonucci et al., 2019, Chen et al., 2020, Duan et al., 2020, Feng et al., 2020,
    Feng et al., 2020, Zhao et al., 2019), two articles reviewed the transportation
    field (Astarita et al., 2020, Pournader et al., 2020), and the remaining four
    articles did not have a specific application background (Gurtu and Johny, 2019,
    Queiroz et al., 2019, Wamba and Queiroz, 2020, Wang et al., 2019, Wang et al.,
    2019, Wang et al., 2019). These articles analyzed the value, current trends and
    future opportunities from the perspective of the impact of blockchain on supply
    chains. To the best of our knowledge, no literature review has been carried out
    that considers the four aspects proposed in this article, including supply chain
    themes, research methodologies, illustration types and industries addressed. In
    addition, this article also discusses the value that blockchain will bring to
    the supply chains through the content of the existing research works, which has
    great significance for the technology at its early stage of development. This
    article aims to answer the following questions to provide research insights for
    scholars and practitioners. Table 1. Review of the previously published literature.

    reviewed articles are described in Section 4. Section 5 explores future research
    opportunities. Finally, Section 6 presents the conclusion. 2. Value of blockchain
    This section illustrates the value of blockchain for supply chains, that is, the
    benefits that blockchain brings to supply chains. The definition and attributes
    of blockchain technology are introduced in Section 2.1. A review of the functions
    of basic blockchain technologies provides further insights to explore the relationship
    of blockchain and supply chains in Section 2.2. 2.1. Blockchain technology In
    technical terms, blockchain refers to a distributed ledger composed of a series
    of data blocks that are linked through cryptographic methods (Zachariadis et al.,
    2019). Each block records a batch of network transaction information; the structure
    of a block is shown in Fig. 1. A block consists of a block header and a block
    body (Liu & Li, 2020). The block header holds information used to connect to the
    previous block and information used for verification, including the version number,
    the hash value of the previous block, the timestamp of the current block writing
    time, the nonce and difficulty target used to prove the difficulty of the workload,
    and a total hash of Merkle tree root for verifying the block body transaction
    (Azzi et al., 2019). The block body contains transaction information and the Merkle
    trees of all the transaction information (Pandey & Litoriya, 2020). In Fig. 1,
    “T” is used to represent “transaction.” Download : Download high-res image (390KB)

    network, any two nodes can conduct transactions, and each transaction is broadcast
    by a single node to all nodes on the entire network (Frizzo-Barker et al., 2020).
    Transaction information is linked in the blockchain when all nodes confirm that
    the records are correct, and this process relies on the consensus mechanism of
    the blockchain network (Feng et al., 2020). The distributed structure enables
    each node to record all transaction information, and each node updates and stores
    all the information of the entire network in real time (Hughes et al., 2019).
    Blockchain technology involves three technological innovations, namely, cryptography,
    consensus mechanisms and smart contracts. (1) Cryptography technologies, including
    the hash function and public key cryptography, are the basic technologies used
    to ensure the security of the blockchain system and are used in data structures,
    verification methods, communication protocols, and information storage (Wang et
    al., 2019, Wang et al., 2019). The hash function guarantees the integrity, authenticity
    and immutability of the distributed ledger data through the hash value and hash
    pointer, and it can convert the input data into a fixed-length digest through
    a hash algorithm, whose process is irreversible (Maesa & Mori, 2020). Public key
    cryptography is an asymmetric encryption algorithm that is used to provide identity
    verification to the blockchain network (Lopez & Farooq, 2020). Public key cryptography
    effectively solves the problem of key distribution and exchange in network communications,
    which ensures the security of information transmission (Ali et al., 2019). (2)
    The consensus mechanism proves the ownership and accuracy of the bookkeeping nodes
    through a consensus algorithm that solves consistency problems. This mechanism
    establishes trust between different nodes in the blockchain system and guarantees
    that each transaction remains consistent for all nodes (Feng et al., 2020). With
    the development of blockchain technology, many consensus algorithms have been
    developed, such as proof of work (POW), proof of stake (POS), and practical byzantine
    fault tolerance (PBFT). (3) A smart contract is a set of promises defined in digital
    form; the contract content is fixed in the blockchain in the form of code, and
    eventually, an automatically executed script is generated (Tanwar et al., 2020).
    Each transaction is processed by a smart contract, and the corresponding contract
    terms can be executed automatically once a predefined condition is triggered (Abdullah
    et al., 2020). This process does not require a third party, which has an enormous
    impact on the design of business models (Zhu et al., 2020). A smart contract can
    be used to model various types of businesses, organizational behaviours and rules
    in the real world and affects interactions among various entities, including the
    transfer of asset ownership, payments of digital assets and currency transactions
    (Wang et al., 2019). 2.2. Blockchain and supply chain relationship The three major
    aspects of blockchain technologies that create value, namely, shareable, secure
    and smart attributes, are summarized according to the analysis of the aforementioned
    blockchain technology, namely, cryptography, consensus mechanism and smart contracts.
    2.2.1. Shareability Blockchain uses a P2P network model, which means that the
    resources and services are distributed across all nodes, allowing each node to
    obtain a copy of the same distributed ledger achieving the data sharing (Drljevic
    et al., 2020, Savelyev, 2018). This mechanism guarantees that a transaction conducted
    by any node requires all nodes to jointly verify the transaction, thus ensuring
    the integrity of the data in the entire network. At the same time, this distributed
    system can better prevent hackers from attacking, and it does not affect the operation
    of the entire system even if individual nodes are attacked. Azzi et al. (2019)
    pointed out that blockchain technology can prevent data fraud caused by data centralization
    in a traditional supply chain because it uses a distributed system that eliminates
    intermediaries. This process also occurs for supply chain finance, which allows
    parties in supply chains to directly carry out activities, such as transfers,
    payments and stock transactions in a secure manner without financial service providers
    (Chen & Wang, 2020). Furthermore, Toennissen and Teuteberg (2020) claimed that
    the elimination of intermediaries reduces the time and cost of transactions. In
    a traditional supply chain, another issue that needs attention is information
    fragmentation between participants, and blockchain is regarded as a promising
    technology that can solve this problem (Gonczol et al., 2020, Wang et al., 2019).
    Longo et al. (2019) concluded that data sharing through blockchain technology
    helped upstream enterprises gain a deeper understanding of the needs of downstream
    customers, which helped enterprises make better decisions. At the same time, the
    ability to obtain timely data can improve procurement management, production management,
    transportation management, inventory management and many other links in a supply
    chain, thereby improving the overall level of supply chain management (Cole et
    al., 2019). In addition, the mode of common recording across the entire network
    allows each permitted modification to be observed in real time, which shortens
    the response time (Nayak & Dhaigude, 2019). Blockchain technology makes intermediaries
    unnecessary and allows for data sharing, making it suitable for large and complex
    supply chain networks, such as those used for international trade, in which a
    large number of stakeholders are involved (Bai and Sarkis, 2020, Cole et al.,
    2019). According to Chang et al. (2020), there are two problems related to traditional
    international trade that need to be urgently solved. The first is that the processing
    platforms used for international trade are mostly centralized, which limits transactions.
    The second is that hard copies are required for all documents required for cross-border
    transportations, so there may be delays, losses, and misplacement, which affect
    the operational efficiency. Liu and Li (2020) considered that the application
    of blockchain can be used to develop digital solutions and could enhance the ability
    to share transaction records in real time across the network to improve operational
    efficiency. 2.2.2. Security The security of the blockchain system is protected
    at three levels. First, decentralization eliminates the possibility of data tampering
    (Schmidt & Wagner, 2019). Second, the use of cryptographic technology guarantees
    data security and ensures that information cannot be modified without authorization
    (Lu, 2018). Finally, the consensus mechanism provides protection for the entire
    network by requiring all nodes on the network to adhere to consistent protocols
    (Singh & Kim, 2018). Behnke and Janssen (2020) claimed that information and product
    security are improved through blockchain-based supply chain management. From the
    perspective of information security, trust among participants is not high due
    to the lack of transparency in traditional supply chains (Feng et al., 2020, Mao
    et al., 2018). Di Vaio and Varriale (2020) pointed out that blockchain technology
    prevents information from being changed, which reduces the risk of the supply
    chain and thus improves trust between the supply chain participants. Blockchain
    guarantees data integrity by ensuring fixed information (on raw materials, processes
    and operators), item flow information (changes in different locations) and changes
    in ownership information (Lambourdiere & Corbin, 2020). Other types of information
    can be collected according to actual needs. Blockchain technology enhances product
    safety (Ding et al., 2020). Effective enterprises have realized that high product
    transparency enhances consumer trust, which is a competitive advantage (Wang et
    al., 2019). Kamble et al. (2020) illustrated that transparency is essential to
    ensure product authenticity and improve product traceability. The increase in
    transparency in blockchain technology depends on two aspects. The first aspect
    is the timestamp in the block, which provides chronological proof of a series
    of transactions (Hyla & Pejas, 2020). The second aspect is the integration of
    modern sensors into blockchain, such as radio frequency identification (RFID)
    and a global positioning system (GPS) (Helo & Shamsuzzoha, 2020). Blockchain technology
    creates a block for each link of goods that follows processes from manufacturing
    to sales, and these blocks are connected to record information on the entire process
    (Azzi et al., 2019). Information cannot be changed once the blocks are formed,
    and this process ensures traceability and thus product safety (Galvez et al.,
    2018, O''Leary, 2017, Yong et al., 2020). With the deterioration of the environment,
    people are favouring low-carbon products more, but it is difficult to define them
    in traditional supply chain systems (Manupati et al., 2020). Blockchain technology
    can track the raw materials of products and the carbon emissions of the entire
    process of a product, which is conducive to customers’ green consumption (Saberi
    et al., 2019). At present, IBM and the Energy Blockchain Lab have jointly developed
    a carbon asset platform using blockchain technology to help organizations measure
    their carbon footprint and facilitate the trading of carbon assets (IBM, 2018).
    2.2.3. Smart capabilities The smart capabilities of blockchain are reflected in
    smart contracts, which is considered a revolutionary application. Singh et al.
    (2020) introduced smart contracts embedded in a blockchain network; contract terms
    can be automatically executed to achieve internal interaction between participants
    when the execution conditions are triggered. Smart contracts are executed quickly,
    which improves operational efficiency, and the rights and interests of the participants
    are protected through the contract terms (Macrinici et al., 2018). Liu and Li
    (2020) proposed that smart contracts reduce paperwork and labour by eliminating
    contract registration and monitoring processes, which reduce operating costs and
    improve the efficiency of supply chains. The contract terms agreed upon by supply
    chain participants are fixed in the coding used for smart contracts, which define
    the statement obligations, benefits, and penalties, and the terms are enforced
    when the conditions for execution are met (Dolgui et al., 2020). For example,
    in a cash-on-delivery smart contract, the stakeholders realize automatic settlement
    when the goods are successfully stored in the warehouse. This high degree of automation
    makes blockchain technology particularly suitable for multi-tier supplier networks
    with complex relationships; in this context, it is difficult to track the status
    of the business and settle payments. Smart contracts can be used to organize the
    financial situation of the entire supply chain network and establish connections
    for transactions between different currencies so that each participant is paid
    (Pournader et al., 2020). At the same time, the use of smart contracts can prevent
    the risk of default and ensure that the trading parties fulfil their obligations
    (Min, 2019). Transactions are carried out within a safe and controllable range,
    as the clearing of the funds of both parties is solidified (Dolgui et al., 2020).
    Smart contracts should be established for the different links in a supply chain
    system and can be used for purchase contracts, transportation contracts, and storage
    contracts. Each contract has its own stated variables, and if any changes occur,
    information is automatically sent to the stakeholders of the contact. Any entity
    that needs other relevant information can obtain the corresponding power by registering
    events in the relevant contract. This approach also ensures information flow throughout
    the supply chain (Panescu & Manta, 2018). 3. Research methodology This section
    describes the research methodology used for the literature review, which consists
    of article screening and article coding. 3.1. Article screening Relevant high-quality
    articles were considered to provide reliable insights into the research questions.
    Web of Science (WoS), Scopus, and Google Scholar are the three most important
    citation databases. WoS is considered to be a more reliable international academic
    journal database than the other two sources and covers the most high-quality research
    articles (Wang et al., 2020, Wang et al., 2020). To further improve the quality
    and rigour of the search for articles, the types of articles reviewed were limited
    to those published in peer-reviewed academic journals and articles that focus
    only on technology, Bitcoin and finance were excluded to make the analysis effective.
    This study used “blockchain” and “supply chain” as the query string. To further
    expand the relevant research content, other query strings related to supply chains
    were identified after a consultation among the authors: “transport”, “logistics”,
    “cross-border trade” and “manufacturing.” All articles with these query strings
    in theme were selected. The term blockchain can be traced back to 2008, but it
    was only used in the financial field in the beginning. In June 2017, the first
    academic journal article related to the combination of blockchain and supply chains
    was published. Hence, the range of the timeframe that was searched was set to
    June 2017 to March 2020. Each article was independently reviewed by four authors
    in the article screening stage. The four authors exchanged opinions to determine
    the selected articles after completing the review. This method reduces individual
    subjective bias and makes the results more rigorous. Table 2 lists the three stages
    used to screen the articles: theme search, type screening and content screening.
    This table also lists the screening criteria. In the first stage, theme search,
    421 articles were selected. After filtering by article type, 198 articles were
    identified. Finally, 106 valid articles remained after content screening. Table
    2. Criteria used to screen the articles. Stage Details Theme search (4 2 1) -Database:WoS

    to the theme search, the articles in the WoS database are initially selected.

    are retained. Content screening (1 0 6) -Read the title and abstracts to judge
    the relevance. -In addition, read the contents of the articles selected in the
    previous step to judge the relevance 3.2. Article coding The coding method used
    in this study is based on the four-dimensional coding proposed by Ghadimi et al.
    (2019) including supply chain themes, research methodologies, illustration types
    and application industries. The selected 106 articles discussed in Section 3.1
    were coded according to the above four dimensions to obtain the four angles of
    content analysis described in Section 4. In the coding process, a problem arises
    that deserves attention: defining the category to which the article belongs is
    a subjective process. Therefore, the guidelines proposed by Wang et al. (2019)
    to double-check the categories were adopted to ensure the rigour and objectivity
    of the classification process. The specific process used is as follows: The first
    author and the second author completed the coding. If there was any inconsistency
    in the coding, the third author participated in the coding and all the authors
    made the final decision together. Here, Zheng et al. (2020) is used as an example
    to introduce the specific coding process. These scholars studied the risk decision-making
    problem in a spacecraft supply chain under decentralized, partially centralized
    and fully centralized situations using blockchain. (1) Supply chain themes. The
    study discussed the risk issues in supply chains, so it belongs to the risk category
    in terms of the specific impact of the blockchain. (2) Research methodologies.
    The study used the Stackelberg game model to explore the profit in three situations,
    so it belongs to the modelling category for mathematical models. (3) Illustration
    types. The use of mathematical models means the study used numerical experiments.
    (4) Industries addressed. The study analyzed a spacecraft production supply chain,
    which obviously belongs to the manufacturing industry category. 4. Findings and
    discussions This section discusses the descriptive and content analysis of the
    106 selected articles as described in Section 3.1, leading to the findings and
    discussion. Basic information on the articles, including publications per year,
    main journals and countries, is described in the descriptive analysis (Section
    4.1). Moreover, content analysis is carried out to analyze the current research
    content based on the four coding dimensions proposed in Section 3.2: including
    supply chain themes (Section 4.2), research methodologies (Section 4.3), illustration
    types (Section 4.4) and industries addressed (Section 4.5). 4.1. Publications
    per year, main journals and countries Table 3 shows the number of articles published
    in related fields since 2017, and the articles are divided into research articles
    and review articles. The overall trend indicates that the number of published
    articles increased year by year, showing that scholars'' research interest has
    gradually increased. The timeframe considered in this study ends with 2020.03.31.
    The number of articles published reached 43 in the first quarter of 2020; therefore,
    the number of articles published throughout the year is expected to exceed 150.
    It can be seen that review articles have appeared since 2019. This is because
    research on the combination of blockchain and supply chain has just started, and
    the previous research results are not rich enough to support the completion of
    review articles. As the research deepens, the number of review articles will rapidly
    increase. Table 3. Number of articles per year. Types 2017 2018 2019 2020 Research
    3 15 40 37 Review 0 0 5 6 Total 3 15 45 43 In addition, the sources of the articles
    are analyzed. The 106 articles considered in this study were published in 45 journals,
    covering areas including computer science, information science, environmental
    science, engineering, manufacturing, operations management, and business management.
    Fig. 2 lists the top ten journals, in which abbreviations (“Int.” for International
    and “Trans.” for Transportation) are used to represent the reported journals.
    The largest number of publications appeared in the International Journal of Information
    Management and IEEE Access, both of which published 12 articles. The impact factors
    of these two journals are 13.17 and 6.17, respectively, which means they are influential.
    Therefore, they are likely to become high-level journals in the field of blockchain-based
    supply chains attracting a large number of submissions in related fields. It is
    worth noting that a large number of articles have not been published in supply
    chain and logistics journals, such as Supply Chain Management: An International
    Journal and Transportation Research Part E-Logistics and transportation review.
    It is speculated that the number of studies on blockchain-based supply chains
    published in these two journals will grow rapidly. Download : Download high-res

    the number of articles. The 106 articles considered in this study come from 31
    countries, so the topic of blockchain-based supply chains has attracted the attention
    of scholars from various countries, and research has been carried out on a global
    scale. Table 4 shows the top eight countries with the total number of published
    articles. China published 23.58% of the total articles, ranking first in the world.
    This is because blockchain has risen to national strategic importance in China,
    and various departments, provinces and cities have also actively issued relevant
    documents to support the development of the blockchain industry (China Blockchain
    Technology and Industrial Development Forum, 2016). Therefore, scholars can actively
    carry out relevant research on blockchain. China is followed by the United States
    (16), Italy (9), the United Kingdom (7), India (7), France (5), Arabia (3), and
    South Korea (3). However, it should be noted that the average number of citations
    in the articles published in China is only 4.04, far lower than 15.75 in papers
    from the United States and 10.57 in papers from the United Kingdom. Table 4. Top

    blockchain technology to supply chains, researchers and practitioners have discussed
    three themes, impact, function and configuration, which are expanded in Wang et
    al. (2019). This study further subdivides these three themes into subthemes based
    on the characteristics of supply chain activities, which are shown in Table A1
    in Appendix A. The 106 articles are classified according to these themes. The
    first theme is “Impact”, with 36 articles, accounting for 34% of all the articles.
    Since research on blockchain-based supply chains has just started, it is necessary
    to define the impact of blockchain on supply chains to identify research opportunities.
    Most of these articles are still in the reasoning stage, meaning that conceptual
    means are used to explain the value, current status, challenges and opportunities
    of blockchain. For example, Queiroz and Wamba (2019) discussed the challenges
    of adopting blockchain in the supply chain through empirical research on the main
    driving forces in India and the United States. In their research, a model based
    on a slightly altered version of the classical unified theory of acceptance and
    use of technology was developed, and the results obtained revealed the existence
    of distinct adoption behaviours between India-based and USA-based professionals.
    For example, in response to the hypothesis that “social influence positively affects
    the behavioural intention to adopt blockchain”, India supports this view, while
    the United States stands on the opposite side. Under the theme “Impact”, 25 articles
    have no specific application area (categorized in the sub-theme “Ordinary”), and
    11 articles explore the impact of industry background including the agriculture
    (Antonucci et al., 2019, Chen et al., 2020, Duan et al., 2020, Feng et al., 2020,
    Kittipanya-ngam and Tan, 2020, Zhao et al., 2019) and service industries (Boulos
    et al., 2018, Chang et al., 2020, Choi et al., 2020, Juma et al., 2019, Yang,
    2019). More industries that have applied blockchain are discussed in Section 4.5.
    Most articles, 59.4%, focus on the second theme “Function”. This theme is related
    to addressing the following problem: “Where will blockchain penetrate the supply
    chain?” These articles focus on the specific changes caused by blockchain in terms
    of a certain aspect, which is a deeper study of the value of blockchain in terms
    of “Impact”. Through a review of 63 articles, it is found that blockchain has
    penetrated four aspects: product (35), process (11), operation (9), and sustainability
    (8). The sub-theme “Product” has attracted the most attention, in which most articles
    focus on “Traceability”. For example, Kamble et al. (2020) identified thirteen
    enablers of blockchain application in the agriculture supply chain based on a
    combined interpretive structural modelling and decision-making trial and evaluation
    laboratory methodology, and the findings from the study suggest that, among the
    identified enablers, traceability was the most significant reason followed by
    auditability, immutability, and provenance. This phenomenon is consistent with
    the view that traceability is the greatest value of blockchain for supply chains.
    In contrast to the “Specific” theme with four subthemes, there are also many articles
    about “Information sharing” and the “Trust system”. In terms of the supply chain
    process, these articles discuss the impact of blockchain on design (Rahmanzadeh
    et al., 2020), order management (Martinez et al., 2019), produce (Leng et al.,
    2018, Mandolla et al., 2019), workflow (Chang et al., 2019, Perboli et al., 2018,
    Philipp et al., 2019) and logistics (Dolgui et al., 2020, Hasan et al., 2019,
    Tijan et al., 2019, Toennissen and Teuteberg, 2020). For example, Martinez et
    al. (2019) studied blockchain-driven customer order management and carried out
    simulations for three scenarios: current with no blockchain, 1-year and 5-year
    blockchain use. The results showed that blockchain improved the efficiency of
    the process: it reduced the number of operations, the average time of orders in
    the system and the workload, showed order traceability, and improved visibility
    to various supply chain participants. The level of operation directly affects
    the overall performance. The existing research studied operations from the viewpoint
    of partnerships (Kim & Shin, 2019), coordination (Li et al., 2019), performance
    (Hald & Kinra, 2019), platforms (Choi, 2019) and risk management (Choi et al.,
    2019, Fu and Zhu, 2019; L. Liu et al., 2019, Min, 2019, Zheng et al., 2020). The
    operation of the supply chain should focus on economic benefits and consider the
    environment and society, which collectively represent the well-known triple bottom
    line (TBL) principle. Saberi et al. (2019) proposed that blockchain technology
    may be a panacea for addressing the TBL, which is based on sustainability. To
    date, eight articles studied sustainability. Among them, two articles considered
    a single factor, environment (Kouhizadeh & Sarkis, 2018) and society (Venkatesh
    et al., 2020). Two factors were studied in three articles: environment and society
    (Castka et al., 2020), economy and society (Yadav & Singh, 2020), economy and
    environment (Manupati et al., 2020). Only three articles comprehensively considered
    all three factors (Di Vaio and Varriale, 2020, Nayak and Dhaigude, 2019, Saberi
    et al., 2019). Therefore, the study of blockchain-based sustainable supply chains
    considering the three dimensions of economy, society and environment is still
    insufficient, and agendas for future studies are proposed in Section 5. Fewer
    studies, only 7, explore the theme “Configuration”. The articles focusing on this
    theme consider the simultaneous application of blockchain technology and emerging
    technologies such as big data, the Internet of Things, and artificial intelligence
    (Bencic et al., 2019, Fernandez-Carames et al., 2019, Lezoche et al., 2020, Mazzei
    et al., 2020, Mondal et al., 2019, Rejeb et al., 2019, Zhang et al., 2020). For
    example, Fernandez-Carames et al. (2019) designed a system in which blockchain
    and a distributed ledger are used to store the big data of a certain inventory
    collected by unmanned aerial vehicles. Different tests that were performed in
    a real industrial warehouse concluded that the system is able to rapidly obtain
    the inventory data compared with traditional manual tasks. Furthermore, the system
    is also capable of estimating item positions from a hovering vantage point that
    leverages their tag’s signal strength. 4.3. Research methodologies This section
    analyzes the research methodologies used to study blockchain-based supply chains.
    Four research method categories are identified through a review of 106 articles:
    conceptual, empirical, modelling and technical. Table A2 in Appendix A shows the
    106 articles grouped in the proposed four method categories, and it can be seen
    that the number of articles aligning with each of the four methodologies are not
    much different. This result illustrates that research opportunities still exist,
    as research in related fields is still in the exploration stage. There are 31
    articles, the largest number, falling into the “Conceptual” category, and this
    is consistent with the development of an emerging research field. A general description,
    literature reviews and theory are developed to address the proposed problem and
    are categorized in the “Conceptual” category, in which most studies were a general
    description. For example, Schmidt and Wagner (2019) utilized transaction cost
    theory to create a better understanding of how blockchain might influence supply
    chain relations, specifically in terms of transaction costs and governance decisions.
    The results revealed blockchain might significantly reduce transaction and governance
    costs of supply chain transactions, especially in reducing search and information
    cost. “Empirical” is the second largest research methodology category, with a
    total of 28 articles, including 19 qualitative articles and 9 quantitative articles.
    In qualitative research, different methods, such as seminars, implementation experience,
    expert interviews, and case studies are adopted to gain research insights. For
    example, van Hoek (2019b) explored lessons learned by early adopters of blockchain
    technology in the supply chain through three case studies from different industries
    (logistics services, consumer products and retail), supply chain positions (manufacturer,
    carrier, and retailer) and geographies (Europe and USA). Based on the insights
    from the case studies, lessons learned include the value in scoping pilots in
    a targeted manner, including the use of existing technology in the pilot, and
    the ability to rapidly when provided with executive and stakeholder engagement.
    In addition to the qualitative analysis mentioned above, some studies carried
    out “Empirical” quantitative research, which refers to developing and testing
    hypotheses, collecting data, and verifying hypotheses. For example, Wong et al.
    (2020) discussed the impact of top management support, cost, market dynamics,
    competitive pressure, and regulatory support on supply chain management based
    on empirical data from 194 small-medium enterprises in Malaysia. The results showed
    competitive pressure, complexity, cost and regulatory support have significant
    effects on behavioural intention. In contrast, market dynamics, regulatory support
    and upper management support were insignificant predictors. A total of 22.6% of
    the articles used modelling methods to solve research problems. More specifically,
    12.3% of the articles adopted mathematical modelling, which consists of nonlinear
    programming, game theory and mean–variance approaches. These approaches attempt
    to solve problems through the results of mathematical operations. For example,
    Manupati et al. (2020) studied the use of blockchain for production allocation
    problems in a multi-echelon supply chain, and the results showed that the blockchain
    approach minimizes both total cost and carbon emissions. Furthermore, 6 articles
    used simulation modelling, and the purpose of this method is to imitate the implementation
    of blockchain. For example, Leng et al. (2018) designed an agricultural supply
    chain system based on blockchain technology, and the results illustrated that
    the proposed system improved the openness and security of transaction information.
    In addition, 5 articles applied multicriteria decision modelling methodologies,
    including fuzzy decision making (FDM) and fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP).
    The barriers (Ozturk & Yildizbasi, 2020), evaluation and selection criteria (Bai
    & Sarkis, 2020) and success factors (S. S. Kamble et al., 2020, Nayak and Dhaigude,
    2019, Yadav and Singh, 2020) were determined using the multicriteria decision
    method. The smallest number of articles, 23, focused on system implementation,
    and current research focuses on the framework (52.2%) and system (47.8%). This
    series of articles attempted to determine how to deploy blockchain in supply chains.
    Technical and business solutions were provided in the “Technical” articles. Some
    scholars proposed technical frameworks, for example, Wu et al. (2017) introduced
    a delivery framework composed of a set of private distributed ledgers and a blockchain
    public ledger. Studies also focused on the implementation of a system. Helo and
    Hao (2019) established a blockchain-based logistics monitoring system that was
    designed and tested based on Ethereum. In general, most systems were implemented
    through Ethereum (Fernandez-Carames et al., 2019, Hasan et al., 2019, Helo and
    Hao, 2019, Toyoda et al., 2017, Yoo and Won, 2018) and Hyperledger Fabric (Cui
    et al., 2019, Wang et al., 2020, Zhang et al., 2020). 4.4. Illustration types
    This study designed three illustration types to narrow the various gaps in the
    research methodologies discussed in Section 4.3 and to identify the theoretical
    gaps and empirical opinions of different authors. Three categories were developed,
    “Application”, “Theoretical approach” and “Numerical examples”, as shown in Table
    A3 of Appendix A. This table shows that 38 articles, the largest number, study
    and verify the proposed theories by analysing case studies or applications of
    blockchain, which is consistent with the view that industry leads academia in
    the study of practical technology. For example, Kshetri (2018) discussed case
    studies of blockchain projects at various stages of development for different
    purposes to analyze how it affects key supply chain management objectives. The
    results showed that blockchain affects cost, quality, speed, reliability, risk
    reduction, sustainability and flexibility. Thirty-five articles (33%) used a “theoretical
    approach”; these studies discussed the theoretical gap by using some methodologies
    or empirical approaches. Only qualitative empirical approaches fall under this
    theme. The quantitative empirical approaches are classified as “Numerical examples”
    due to the use of empirical data. For example, the study of Wang et al. (2019)
    falls into the “theoretical approach” category because these scholars determine
    how blockchain technology has transformed the supply chain through in-depth interviews
    with 14 supply chain experts. However, Yang (2019) studied the driving factors
    of the successful application of blockchain in a maritime supply chain through
    empirical data from top management, members of boards of directors and planning
    staff. Hence, their research is classified into the “Numerical example” category.
    Thirty-three articles used “Numerical examples” to prove the effectiveness of
    the developed methods; this is regarded as an appropriate approach for verifying
    the theories of the study, but it should also be noted that the limitations of
    this approach cannot be fully fitted unless it is applied in practical applications.
    Longo et al. (2019) simulated the operation process of a blockchain-based supply
    chain to quantitatively evaluate the benefits that companies can obtain under
    this context, and the results showed that blockchain technology is a convenient
    tool for supply chain collaboration, trust and overall performance. More discussions
    about the theory and practice are provided in Section 5.3. 4.5. Industries addressed
    Research on the combination of blockchain and supply chains focuses on different
    industrial sectors. The review articles are classified into primary, secondary
    and tertiary industries according to the North American Industry Classification
    System (Wang et al., 2019). Primary industries refer to agriculture, forestry,
    fishing, and animal husbandry, and secondary industries include manufacturing,
    light industry, construction, mining and so on. Trade, logistics, transportation,
    retail, etc., are all tertiary industries. Table A4 in Appendix A shows that 36
    out of 106 articles did not focus on a specific industry application, which is
    indicated under the category “None”. These studies tried to explain common problems,
    which is the current research focus. In the articles focusing on a specific industry,
    the primary, secondary, and tertiary industries accounted for 21.7%, 18, 9%, and
    17.9%, respectively. Most research mainly focused on primary industries, and agriculture
    has attracted the most attention, with studies on pork (George et al., 2019, Sander
    et al., 2018), soybeans (Salah et al., 2019), wine (Bencic et al., 2019), fresh
    food (Perboli et al., 2018), eggs (Bumblauskas et al., 2020), cereals (Zhang et
    al., 2020, Zhang et al., 2020) and so on. The agricultural field attracted the
    most attention. There are two reasons to show that the concern for the agricultural
    field is reasonable. The first reason is that consumers need detailed product
    information from the farm to the table, and blockchain technology improves the
    traceability of agricultural products (Feng et al., 2020). At the same time, blockchain
    technology can realize real-time temperature monitoring for fresh foods with strict
    temperature requirements such as eggs and pork, during circulation (Leng et al.,
    2018). The second reason is due to concerns about food safety. Blockchain technology
    can quickly and accurately locate problematic products to improve the recall rate
    of food and be used to build a complete recall system to respond to public health
    emergencies (Zhao et al., 2019). The second largest group of articles focuses
    on three types of secondary industries: manufacturing (Ko et al., 2018, Mandolla
    et al., 2019, Xu et al., 2019), light industry (Sylim et al., 2018, Tseng et al.,
    2018, Yong et al., 2020), and construction (Wang et al., 2020, Xiong et al., 2019).
    For example, Mandolla et al. (2019) focus on the phases characterizing the metal
    additive manufacturing process for producing components for the aircraft industry
    and propose a digital twin for additive manufacturing in the aircraft industry
    through the exploitation of blockchain solutions, ultimately providing a conceptual
    answer to securing and organizing the data generated through an end-to-end additive
    manufacturing process in the aircraft industry. Most of the research focused on
    manufacturing because the bullwhip effect arises if an upstream enterprise cannot
    obtain the demand of the downstream enterprise in a timely and accurate manner.
    Blockchain technology improves information incompleteness and asymmetry in the
    manufacturing process and can be used to achieve real-time information sharing
    (Fu & Zhu, 2019). Finally, the third group of articles studied the field of tertiary
    industry, which consists of trading (Allen et al., 2019), transportation (Yanovich
    et al., 2018), retail (Choi & Luo, 2019) and health (Boulos et al., 2018). The
    application of blockchain technology in the trade field can bring some benefits,
    such as reducing intermediaries, reducing costs and increasing efficiency (Liu
    & Li, 2020). In addition to the specific industry sector, some scholars have also
    conducted research in multiple industrial sectors (meaning an article contains
    two or more application scenarios), which are shown under the category “Multi-industry”
    (Astarita et al., 2020, Azzi et al., 2019, Chang et al., 2020, Gurtu and Johny,
    2019, Karamchandani et al., 2020, Toennissen and Teuteberg, 2020, van Hoek, 2020,
    Wamba and Queiroz, 2020), which makes the conclusions more universal and applicable
    to providing industry insights. For example, Toennissen and Teuteberg (2020) investigated
    ten blockchain-based industries, including ocean freight, agri-food, animal products,
    etc., and the results showed that there is no disintermediation. Chang et al.
    (2020) summarized the key challenges for blockchain implementation through the
    analysis of blockchain applications in the maritime industry, transportation industry,
    food, pharmaceuticals and manufacturing supply chains. 5. Future opportunities
    in the field of blockchain-based supply chain The findings and discussions in
    Section 4 help to determine the research gaps and identify future research opportunities.
    Based on 4.2 Supply chain themes, 4.3 Research methodologies, 4.4 Illustration
    types, 4.5 Industries addressed, research gaps and opportunities are found in
    terms of the following four directions: (1) ignored themes in supply chains, (2)
    applied methodologies in the research, (3) academic theory and industrial practice
    and (4) practice in different industrial sectors. 5.1. Ignored themes in supply
    chains The research of configuration receives less attention in comparison with
    the themes of impact and function. This situation may be due to the following
    three reasons (Duan et al., 2020). The first is described as the amount of data
    increases exponentially with the widespread use of the the Internet of Things
    (IoT) devices, which brings great difficulties to data storage. The second is
    the delay in the transmission process. The consistency of the entire blockchain
    network is ensured through delay, but the delay is unacceptable for many IoT-based
    applications. The third is the security issue; the blockchain network security
    and the privacy of the participants are both worthy of attention due to the vulnerability
    of the IoT. Zhang et al. (2020) proposed that the integration of blockchain and
    IoT, artificial intelligence, big data, machine learning and other emerging technologies
    can achieve excellent operation of the supply chain. Therefore, carrying out related
    research in this field, especially regarding data storage, information transmission,
    and blockchain network security, is a promising avenue. The discussion on sustainability
    seems to be limited compared with other subthemes. The following limitations are
    discovered by analysing eight articles related to the theme of sustainability:
    (1) Social dimension attention is insufficient. Social-level standards should
    all be considered in the sustainable supply chain, including working conditions,
    work health and safety, human rights and product safety. However, product safety
    is the focus of most articles, and only one article considers other dimensions
    in addition to product safety (Venkatesh et al., 2020). Therefore, relevant research
    is needed to improve the indicators of the social dimension in the blockchain-based
    supply chain. (2) Environmental concern is not comprehensive. The environmental
    issues considered in supply chains should include waste management, energy efficiency,
    greenhouse gas emissions and so on. Most of the current research focuses on the
    discussion of “Green”, that is, reducing carbon emissions (Manupati et al., 2020).
    A few articles mention waste management (Kouhizadeh and Sarkis, 2018, Saberi et
    al., 2019), and there is no relevant research on energy efficiency. Therefore,
    more comprehensive environmental issues need to be studied to better emphasize
    the role of blockchain in promoting environmental management. (3) Lack of quantitative
    research. Since conceptual methods were used in most articles, the quantitative
    studies are deemed inadequate. At present, there is no research that can systematically
    propose a sustainable supply chain performance model under the blockchain environment.
    More research should be carried out under the theme of coordination, performance
    and order management. From Table A1, it can be seen that the top five specific
    articles are traceability (20), information sharing (9), economy, society and
    environment (8), trust system (6), and risk (5). This phenomenon is consistent
    with the value of the blockchain for supply chains analyzed in Section 2. The
    other topics listed in Table A1 have not received much attention, such as coordination,
    performance and order management, which are crucial for supply chains management
    (Hald and Kinra, 2019, Li et al., 2019, Martinez et al., 2019). Therefore, the
    research related to these topics should also be conducted to meet the challenges
    of blockchain-based supply chains. 5.2. Applied methodologies in the research
    Four methodologies are developed to carry out the research, including conceptual,
    empirical, modelling and technical. This section explores the research opportunities
    from the above four methodologies. First, literature reviews have gradually become
    the focus of research under the conceptual category with the increase in the number
    of related studies. However, the existing literature review can be divided into
    two categories: research in which there is no specific industry background focus,
    and research that has an agricultural background focus. Hence, there is a lack
    of literature reviews about the application of blockchain in manufacturing, trade
    and other specific fields. Second, current research uses empirical qualitative
    methods. As this research deepens, case studies and quantitative research should
    occupy a dominant position to guide the configuration of blockchain in supply
    chains. Since blockchain technology is in the early stages of development, conceptual
    and empirical methodologies can be used to strengthen the relationship between
    blockchain and supply chains and propose related theories. As the research continues,
    it is necessary to use modelling methods to verify newly developed theories. Currently,
    there are many research opportunities in mathematical modelling, simulation modelling
    and multicriteria decisions, which fall in the modelling category. There is a
    lack of studies using mathematical modelling for the direct application of blockchain.
    At present, research content focuses on the blockchain environment and determining
    the factors affected by blockchain as well as their impact on the results. For
    example, Ko et al. (2018) compared the impact of blockchain technology on the
    profits of manufacturing companies, and the results showed that blockchain technology
    improves the profitability and competitiveness of manufacturing firms. Choi et
    al. (2019) discussed aviation logistics risks in the era of blockchain, focusing
    on “air-logistics related operations”, “demand management”, “supply management”,
    and “supply–demand coordination”. Therefore, research using mathematical modelling
    to analyze blockchain technology is urgently needed to address this research gap.
    The articles using simulation modelling connect theory and practice and narrow
    the gap between them. There are six articles in the category for this theme, but
    only one article simulates the entire supply chain operation (Longo et al., 2019).
    Therefore, future simulation research should consider goods, information, capital
    flow, organization, production, and delivery processes (purchasing, inventory
    management, logistics management, etc.) with suppliers, wholesalers, retailers,
    and carriers. Five articles use multicriteria decision-making models to determine
    the successful factors of implementation (Kamble et al., 2020, Nayak and Dhaigude,
    2019, Yadav and Singh, 2020), obstacles to implementation (Ozturk & Yildizbasi,
    2020) and blockchain selection and evaluation (Bai & Sarkis, 2020). There are
    gaps in some of the studies determining the factors of and obstacles to successful
    implementation, so the general conclusion needs to be applied to blockchain practice.
    It is also necessary to establish a connection between these factors through mathematical
    modelling or simulation modelling and identify new research gaps. Finally, research
    on technology should be strengthened. The review of the technology studies indicates
    that the following two aspects are not well studied. First, each company currently
    has its own management system, so studies should pay more attention to existing
    systems that can be integrated with blockchain technology. Second, many enterprises
    have developed their own unique blockchain platforms. If an enterprise participates
    in multiple groups, it needs to use multiple platforms, which will increase the
    burden of the participants and consume too many resources. Therefore, unified
    technical standards are needed to ensure system compatibility. 5.3. Academic theory
    and industrial practice Theoretical gaps and empirical claims are verified in
    three types of articles, namely, those that fall into the application, theoretical
    approach and numerical examples categories, as shown in Table A3. Thirty-eight
    articles validated their theories through “Applications”. This method is generally
    accepted by the related research community, and the research results provide opinions
    for current academic and practical research. To better explore the relationship
    between academic theory and industrial practice, scholars should consider the
    following research opportunities. Blockchain technology has not attracted the
    attention of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Through the analysis of
    13 case studies in the “Application” category, it is found that most cases are
    concerned with the implementation of blockchain projects of some large enterprises,
    such as Wal-Mart, IBM and Maersk, and only two of them focus on SMEs (Chang et
    al., 2020, Perboli et al., 2018). It is normal for this phenomenon to occur, and
    the development of SMEs is lagging behind that of large enterprises in emerging
    technologies due to the difference in cognitive level and infrastructure. However,
    blockchain technology can solve current dilemmas of SMEs, including limited resources
    and the difficulty in finding investors and expanding the business scale. Therefore,
    blockchain technology presents both opportunities and challenges for SMEs. At
    the same time, SMEs should also recognize their own advantages. Having a concise
    organizational structure makes the deployment of blockchain easier and the initial
    cost lower. As noted above, relevant research on SMEs is in-depth. Since research
    on SMEs has just started, there are many topics that can be considered: (1) What
    value does blockchain technology have for SMEs, and how does this value differ
    from that for large enterprises? (2) What are the obstacles to successful blockchain
    implementation in SMEs? What are the similarities and differences concerning those
    found in large enterprises? The voices of different groups should be investigated
    when academic research is conducted. There are 35 articles using the “Theoretical
    approach” method, so a question arises: Can theory be used to guide practice?
    Pagell and Shevchenko (2014) claimed that academic research involving practice
    managers can better guide practical activities. Therefore, some research involves
    the intersection of theoretical methods and numerical experiments due to the use
    of statistics. To carry out research on industrial practice, seminars, questionnaire
    surveys and expert interviews are designed to obtain data. The interviewees are
    supply chain experts (Hackius and Petersen, 2020, Kim and Shin, 2019, Philipp
    et al., 2019, Wang et al., 2019, Wang et al., 2019), supply chain industry managers
    (Dubey et al., 2020, Sander et al., 2018, van Hoek, 2019a, van Hoek, 2019b), and
    supply chain practitioners (Behnke and Janssen, 2020, Kamble et al., 2019, Karamchandani
    et al., 2020, Queiroz and Wamba, 2019, Sheel and Nath, 2019, van Hoek, 2020, Wong
    et al., 2020, Yang, 2019), with different perspectives from academia and industry.
    Future research needs to include other groups, such as individuals representing
    the government, different industries, and different countries, to obtain a more
    general view. The articles using numerical experiments operate somewhere in the
    middle of “theoretical method” and “real-world application”, which connects theory
    and practice. The sustainability theme deserves more attention. In the numerical
    example category, there are 12 articles that considered cost or profit when the
    objective function was established (Choi, 2019, Choi et al., 2020, Feng et al.,
    2020, Choi and Luo, 2019, Choi et al., 2019, Hayrutdinov et al., 2020, Ko et al.,
    2018, Li et al., 2019, Liu et al., 2019, Longo et al., 2019, Manupati et al.,
    2020, Rahmanzadeh et al., 2020, Zheng et al., 2020); these two aspects have attracted
    great attention and will be the focus of future research. However, only one of
    these articles in the sustainability theme category considered environmental factors
    (Manupati et al., 2020), which means that relevant research on theory and practice
    of the sustainability theme is insufficient. 5.4. Practice in different industrial
    sectors Tertiary industry presents prospects for the future of blockchain-based
    supply chains. According to the survey results presented in Table A4, research
    on blockchain-based supply chains considers primary, secondary and tertiary industries,
    indicating that blockchain has good applicability in all industries. In addition,
    the proportion of studies on various industries is not very different. This result
    indicates that there are still research opportunities for studying blockchain
    technology in various industries. However, in recent decades, the economy has
    developed rapidly and there is a great focus on tertiary industries rather than
    secondary industries. Therefore, more relevant research will be carried out in
    tertiary industries to determine the value of blockchain. More industrial sectors
    should be studied. In terms of the industries subcategory, the agriculture, manufacturing,
    and trade sectors have received the most attention. That is, the shareability,
    security, and smart capabilities of blockchain technology are helpful for solving
    problems in these industry sectors. There are few studies focusing on forests
    and fisheries (Figorilli et al., 2018, Howson, 2020), and some industries have
    also been overlooked, such as animal husbandry in the primary industry, mining
    and energy in the secondary industry, and cultural entertainment in the tertiary
    industry. These industries also represent future research opportunities. 6. Conclusions
    This study included a review of existing research on blockchain technology in
    supply chains. Overall, 106 publications were identified through an article theme
    search, type screening and content screening. Then, through descriptive analysis
    and content analysis, five themes were identified in the 106 publications, including
    (1) publications per year, main journals and countries, (2) supply chain themes,
    (3) research methodologies, (4) illustration types and (5) industries addressed.
    The results and findings of this study prove that research on blockchain-based
    supply chains is an emerging field that is receiving strong attention. Specific
    findings and discussions are addressed in Section 4, and future research opportunities
    are presented in Section 5; these are identified based on the discussion in Section
    4 and our academic experience. To our knowledge, this study is the first literature
    review that considers the supply chain themes, research methodologies, illustration
    types and industries addressed. This review of research of blockchain-based supply
    chains is timely because it provides a solid foundation for related studies. The
    contribution of this research is twofold. For academia, this study explains the
    value of blockchain technology for supply chains, and insights for future agendas
    are provided for scholars. In terms of industry and individuals focused on practice,
    this study helps managers worry less about applying blockchain and implementing
    blockchain plans. Finally, although a detailed search was conducted, we acknowledge
    that some related articles were missed. This study considered only peer-reviewed
    journal papers; conference papers, books, newspapers, reviews and other documents
    are not included. Therefore, a literature review that overcomes the above limitations
    should be conducted in the future. CRediT authorship contribution statement Ming

    the incumbent industry to smart industry featured with data-driven decision-making.
    However, intrinsic features of IoT result in a number of challenges, such as decentralization,
    poor interoperability, privacy, and security vulnerabilities. Blockchain technology
    brings the opportunities in addressing the challenges of IoT. In this paper, we
    investigate the integration of blockchain technology with IoT. We name such synthesis
    of blockchain and IoT as blockchain of things (BCoT). This paper presents an in-depth
    survey of BCoT and discusses the insights of this new paradigm. In particular,
    we first briefly introduce IoT and discuss the challenges of IoT. Then, we give
    an overview of blockchain technology. We next concentrate on introducing the convergence
    of blockchain and IoT and presenting the proposal of BCoT architecture. We further
    discuss the issues about using blockchain for fifth generation beyond in IoT as
    well as industrial applications of BCoT. Finally, we outline the open research
    directions in this promising area. Published in: IEEE Internet of Things Journal

    Internet of Things (IoT) is paving the way for a world, where many of our daily
    objects will be interconnected and will interact with their environment in order
    to collect information and automate certain tasks. Such a vision requires, among
    other things, seamless authentication, data privacy, security, robustness against
    attacks, easy deployment, and self-maintenance. Such features can be brought by
    blockchain, a technology born with a cryptocurrency called Bitcoin. In this paper,
    a thorough review on how to adapt blockchain to the specific needs of IoT in order
    to develop Blockchain-based IoT (BIoT) applications is presented. After describing
    the basics of blockchain, the most relevant BIoT applications are described with
    the objective of emphasizing how blockchain can impact traditional cloud-centered
    IoT applications. Then, the current challenges and possible optimizations are
    detailed regarding many aspects that affect the design, development, and deployment
    of a BIoT application. Finally, some recommendations are enumerated with the aim
    of guiding future BIoT researchers and developers on some of the issues that will
    have to be tackled before deploying the next generation of BIoT applications.

    Publisher: IEEE Funding Agency: SECTION I. Introduction The Internet of Things
    (IoT) is expanding at a fast pace and some reports [1] predict that IoT devices
    will grow to 26 billions by 2020, which are 30 times the estimated number of devices
    deployed in 2009 and is far more than the 7.3 billion smartphones, tablets and
    PCs that are expected to be in use by 2020. Moreover, some forecasts [2] anticipate
    a fourfold growth in Machine-to-Machine (M2M) connections in the next years (from
    780 million in 2016 to 3.3 billion by 2021), which may be related to a broad spectrum
    of applications like home automation [3], transportation [4], defense and public
    safety [5], wearables [6] or augmented reality [7], [8]. In order to reach such
    a huge growth, it is necessary to build an IoT stack, standardize protocols and
    create the proper layers for an architecture that will provide services to IoT
    devices. Currently, most IoT solutions rely on the centralized server-client paradigm,
    connecting to cloud servers through the Internet. Although this solution may work
    properly nowadays, the expected growth suggests that new paradigms will have to
    be proposed. Among such proposals, decentralized architectures were suggested
    in the past to create large Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs)
    [9]–[11], but some pieces were missing in relation to privacy and security until
    the arrival of blockchain technology. Therefore, as it is illustrated in Figure
    1, in the last years pre-IoT closed and centralized mainframe architectures evolved
    towards IoT open-access cloud-centered alternatives, being the next step the distribution
    of the cloud functionality among multiple peers, where blockchain technology can
    help. FIGURE 1. Past, present and future IoT architectures. Show All Blockchain
    technologies are able to track, coordinate, carry out transactions and store information
    from a large amount of devices, enabling the creation of applications that require
    no centralized cloud. Some companies like IBM go further and talk about blockchain
    as a technology for democratizing the future IoT [12], since it addresses the
    current critical challenges for its massive adoption: Many IoT solutions are still
    expensive due to costs related to the deployment and maintenance of centralized
    clouds and server farms. When such an infrastructure is not created by the supplier,
    the cost comes from middlemen. Maintenance is also a problem when having to distribute
    regular software updates to millions of smart devices. After Edward Snowden leaks
    [13], [14], it is difficult for IoT adopters to trust technological partners who,
    in general, give device access and control to certain authorities (i.e., governments,
    manufacturers or service providers), allowing them to collect and analyze user
    data. Therefore, privacy and anonymity should be at the core of future IoT solutions.
    Lack of trust is also fostered by closed-source code. To increase trust and security,
    transparency is essential, so open-source approaches should be taken into account
    when developing the next generation of IoT solutions. It is important to note
    that open-source code, like closed-source code, is still susceptible to bugs and
    exploits, but, since it can be monitored constantly by many users, it is less
    prone to malicious modifications from third parties. Blockchain technology has
    been growing at an astounding pace over the past two years. As reported by Statista
    [15], investments by venture capitalists in blockchain start-ups rose from 93
    million to 550 million U.S. dollars from 2013 to 2016. Furthermore, the market
    for blockchain technology worldwide is forecast to grow to 2.3 billion U.S. dollars
    by 2021. According to McKinsey & Company, although it is still in a nascent stage,
    blockchain technology may reach its full potential within the next 4 years based
    on its current pace of evolution [16]. In addition, as of writing, there are over
    1,563 digital coins [17], just a few years after Bitcoin [18], the cryptocurrency
    that originated the blockchain, was born. Bitcoin is a digital coin whose transactions
    are exchanged in a decentralized trustless way combining peer-to-peer file sharing
    with public-key cryptography. Public keys are alphanumeric strings formed by 27
    to 32 characters that are used to send and receive Bitcoins, avoiding the necessity
    of making use of personal information to identify users. One feature that characterizes
    Bitcoin is miners, who receive coins for their computational work to verify and
    store payments in the blockchain. Such payments, like in any other currency, are
    performed in exchange of products, services or fiat money. This paper is not aimed
    at detailing the inner workings of Bitcoin, but the interested readers can find
    good overviews on how Bitcoin works in [19]–[21]. The use of cryptocurrencies
    based on blockchain technology is said to revolutionize payments thanks to their
    advantages respect to traditional currencies. Since middlemen are removed, merchant
    payment fees can be reduced below 1% and users do not have to wait days for transfers,
    receiving funds immediately. Modern cryptocurrencies can be divided into three
    elements [19]: blockchain, protocol and currency. It must be indicated that a
    coin can implement its own currency and protocol, but its blockchain may run on
    the blockchain of another coin like Bitcoin or Ethereum [22]. For instance, Counterparty
    [23] has its own currency and protocol, but it runs on the Bitcoin blockchain.
    In the case of a cryptocurrency, the blockchain acts as a ledger that stores all
    the coin transactions that have been performed. This means that the blockchain
    grows continuously, adding new blocks every certain time intervals. A full node
    (a computer that validates transactions) owns a copy of the whole blockchain,
    which also contains information about user addresses and balances. If the blockchain
    is public, in can be queried through a block explorer like Blockchain.info in
    order to obtain the transactions related to a specific address. Therefore, the
    key contribution of blockchain is that it provides a way to carry out transactions
    with another person or entity without having to rely on third-parties. This is
    possible thanks to many decentralized miners (i.e., accountants) that scrutinize
    and validate every transaction. This contribution allowed the Bitcoin blockchain
    to provide a solution to the Byzantine Generals’ Problem [24], since it is able
    to reach an agreement about something (a battle plan) among multiple parties (generals)
    that do not trust each other, when only exchanging messages, which may come from
    malicious third-parties (traitors) that may try to mislead them. In the case of
    cryptocurrencies, this computational problem is related to the double-spend problem,
    which deals with how to confirm that some amount of digital cash was not already
    spent without the validation of a trusted third-party (i.e., usually, a bank)
    that keeps a record of all the transactions and user balances. IoT shares some
    common problems with cryptocurrencies, since in an IoT system there are many entities
    (nodes, gateways, users) that do not necessarily trust each other when performing
    transactions. However, there are several aspects that differentiate IoT from digital
    currencies, like the amount of computing power available in the nodes or the necessity
    for minimizing the energy consumed in devices powered with batteries. Therefore,
    this paper studies such similarities and analyzes the advantages that blockchain
    can bring to IoT despite its current practical limitations. Moreover, the main
    Blockchain-based IoT (BIoT) architectures and improvements that have already proposed
    are reviewed. Furthermore, the most relevant future challenges for the application
    of blockchain to IoT are detailed. Other authors have previously presented surveys
    on the application of blockchain to different fields. For instance, in [25] it
    is provided an extensive description on the basics of blockchain and smart contracts,
    and it is given a good overview on the application and deployment of BIoT solutions.
    However, although the paper provides very useful information, it does not go deep
    into the characteristics of the ideal BIoT architecture or on the possible optimizations
    to be performed for creating BIoT applications. Another interesting work is presented
    in [26], where the authors provide a generic review on the architecture and the
    different mechanisms involved in blockchain, although it is not focused on its
    application to IoT. Similarly, in [27] and [28] different researchers give overviews
    on blockchain, but they emphasize its application to different Big Data areas
    and multiple industrial applications. Finally, it is worth mentioning the systematic
    reviews presented in [29] and [30], which analyze the sort of topics that papers
    in the literature deal with when proposing the use of blockchain. Unlike the reviews
    previously mentioned, this work presents a holistic approach to blockchain for
    IoT scenarios, including not only the basics on blockchain-based IoT applications,
    but also a thorough analysis on the most relevant aspects involved on their development,
    deployment and optimization. It is also the aim of this work to envision the potential
    contribution of blockchain for revolutionizing the IoT industry and confront today
    challenges. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II describes
    the basics of blockchain technologies: how they work, which types exist and how
    to decide if it is appropriate to make use of a blockchain. Section III presents
    the most relevant BIoT applications. Section IV reviews critical aspects to be
    optimized in a blockchain in order to adapt it to an IoT application. Section
    V describes the main shortcomings of current BIoT applications and outlines the
    primary technical challenges they face. Section VI identifies further medium-term
    challenges and proposes recommendations for IoT developers. Finally, Section VII
    is devoted to conclusions. SECTION II. Blockchain Basics A blockchain is like
    a distributed ledger whose data are shared among a network of peers. As it was
    previously mentioned, it is considered as the main contribution of Bitcoin, since
    it solved a longer-lasting financial problem known as the double-spend problem.
    The solution proposed by Bitcoin consisted in looking for the consensus of most
    mining nodes, who append the valid transactions to the blockchain. Although the
    concept of blockchain was originated as a tool for a cryptocurrency, it is not
    necessary to develop a cryptocurrency to use a blockchain and build decentralized
    applications [31]. A blockchain, as its name implies, is a chain of timestamped
    blocks that are linked by cryptographic hashes. To introduce the reader into the
    inner workings of a blockchain, the next subsections describe its basic characteristics
    and functioning. A. Blockchain Basic Functioning In order to use a blockchain,
    it is first required to create a P2P network with all the nodes interested in
    making use of such a blockchain. Every node of the network receives two keys:
    a public key, which is used by the other users for encrypting the messages sent
    to a node, and a private key, which allows a node to read such messages. Therefore,
    two different keys are used, one for encrypting and another for decrypting. In
    practice, the private key is used for signing blockchain transactions (i.e., to
    approve such transactions), while the public key works like a unique address.
    Only the user with the proper private key is able to decrypt the messages encrypted
    with the corresponding public key. This is called asymmetric cryptography. A detailed
    explanation of its inner workings is out of the scope of this paper, but the interested
    reader can obtain further details in [32] and [33]. When a node carries out a
    transaction, it signs it and then broadcasts it to its one-hop peers. The fact
    of signing the transaction in a unique way (using the private key) enables authenticating
    it (only the user with a specific private key can sign it) and guarantees integrity
    (if there is an error during the transmission of the data, it will not be decrypted).
    As the peers of the node that broadcasts the transaction receive the signed transaction,
    they verify that it is valid before retransmitting it to other peers, thus, contributing
    to its spread through the network. The transactions disseminated in this way and
    that are considered valid by the network are ordered and packed into a timestamped
    block by special nodes called miners. The election of the miners and the data
    included into the block depend on a consensus algorithm (a more detailed definition
    of the concept of consensus algorithm is given later in Section IV-D). The blocks
    packed by a miner are then broadcast back into the network. Then the blockchain
    nodes verify that the broadcast block contains valid transactions and that it
    references the previous block of the chain by using the corresponding hash. If
    such conditions are not fulfilled, the block is discarded. However, if both conditions
    are verified successfully, the nodes add the block to their chain, updating the
    transactions. B. Types of Blockchains There are different types of blockchains
    depending on the managed data, on the availability of such data, and on what actions
    can be performed by a user. Thus, it can be distinguished between public and private,
    and permissioned and permissionless blockchains. It is important to indicate that
    some authors use the terms public/permissionless and private/permissioned as synonyms,
    what may be coherent when talking about cryptocurrencies, but that is not the
    case for IoT applications, where it is important to distinguish between authentication
    (who can access the blockchain; private versus public) and authorization (what
    an IoT device can do; permissionless versus permissioned). Nonetheless, note that
    such distinctions are still in debate and the definitions given next might differ
    from others in the literature. In public blockchains anyone can join the blockchain
    without the approval of third-parties, being able to act as a simple node or as
    miner/validator. Miners/validators are usually given economic incentives in public
    blockchains like Bitcoin, Ethereum or Litecoin [34]. In the case of private blockchains,
    the owner restricts network access. Many private blockchains are also permissioned
    in order to control which users can perform transactions, carry out smart contracts
    (a concept defined later in Section III) or act as miners in the network, but
    note that not all private blockchains are necessarily permissioned. For instance,
    an organization can deploy a private blockchain based on Ethereum, which is permissionless.
    Examples of permissioned blockchains are the ones used by Hyperledger-Fabric [35]
    or Ripple [36]. It can also be distinguished between blockchains aimed exclusively
    at tracking digital assets (e.g., Bitcoin) and blockchains that enable running
    certain logic (i.e., smart contracts). Moreover, there are systems that make use
    of tokens (e.g., Ripple), while others do not (e.g., Hyperledger). Note that such
    tokens are not necessarily related to the existence of a cryptocurrency, but they
    may be used as internal receipts that prove that certain events happened at certain
    time instants. As a summary, the different types of blockchains are depicted in
    Figure 2 together with several examples of implementations. FIGURE 2. Blockchain
    taxonomy and practical examples. Show All C. Determining the Need for Using a
    Blockchain Before delving into the details on how to make use of a blockchain
    for IoT applications, it must be first emphasized that a blockchain is not always
    the best solution for every IoT scenario. Traditional databases or Directed Acyclic
    Graph (DAG) based ledgers [37] may be a better fit for certain IoT applications.
    Specifically, in order to determine if the use of a blockchain is appropriate,
    a developer should decide if the following features are necessary for an IoT application:
    Decentralization. IoT applications demand decentralization when there is not a
    trusted centralized system. However, many users still trust blindly certain companies,
    government agencies or banks, so if there is mutual trust, a blockchain is not
    required. P2P exchanges. In IoT most communications go from nodes to gateways
    that route data to a remote server or cloud. Communications among peers at a node
    level are actually not very common, except for specific applications, like in
    intelligent swarms [38] or in mist computing systems [39]. There are also other
    paradigms that foster communications among nodes at the same level, as it happens
    in fog computing with local gateways [40], [41]. Payment system. Some IoT applications
    may require to perform economic transactions with third parties, but many applications
    do not. Moreover, economic transactions can still be carried out through traditional
    payment systems, although they usually imply to pay transaction fees and it is
    necessary to trust banks or middlemen. Public sequential transaction logging.
    Many IoT networks collect data that need to be timestamped and stored sequentially.
    Nonetheless, such needs may be easily fulfilled with traditional databases, especially
    in cases where security is guaranteed or where attacks are rare. Robust distributed
    system. Distributed systems can also be built on top of clouds, server farms or
    any form of traditional distributed computing systems [42]. The need of this feature
    is not enough to justify the use of a blockchain: there also has to be at least
    a lack of trust in the entity that manages the distributed computing system. Micro-transaction
    collection. Some IoT applications [43], [44] may need to keep a record of every
    transaction to maintain traceability, for auditing purposes or because Big Data
    techniques will be applied later [45], [46]. In these situations, a sidechain
    may be useful [47]. However, other applications do not need to store every collected
    value. For example, in remote agricultural monitoring, where communications are
    expensive, it is usual to make use of IoT nodes that wake up every hour to obtain
    environmental data from sensors. In such cases, a local system may collect and
    store the data, and once a day it transmits the processed information altogether
    in one transaction [48]. Figure 3 shows a generic flow diagram that allows for
    determining the type of blockchain that is necessary depending on the characteristics
    of an IoT system. FIGURE 3. Flow diagram for deciding when to use blockchain in
    an IoT application. Show All SECTION III. BIoT Applications Blockchain technology
    can be applied in many fields and use cases. Swan [19] suggested that blockchain
    applicability evolution started with Bitcoin (blockchain 1.0), then evolved towards
    smart contracts (blockchain 2.0) and later moved to justice, efficiency and coordination
    applications (blockchain 3.0). Regarding smart contracts, they are defined as
    pieces of self-sufficient decentralized code that are executed autonomously when
    certain conditions are met. Smart contracts can be applied in many practical cases,
    including international transfers, mortgages or crowd funding [49]. Ethereum is
    arguably the most popular blockchain-based platform for running smart contracts,
    although it can actually run other distributed applications and interact with
    more than one blockchain. In fact, Ethereum is characterized by being Turing-complete,
    which is a mathematical concept that indicates that Ethereum’s programming language
    can be used to simulate any other language. A detailed explanation on how smart
    contracts work is out of the scope of this paper, but the interested reader can
    find a really good description in Section II.D of [25]. Beyond cryptocurrencies
    and smart contracts, blockchain technologies can be applied in different areas
    (the most relevant are shown in Figure 4) where IoT applications are involved
    [29], like sensing [50], [51], data storage [52], [53], identity management [54],
    timestamping services [55], smart living applications [56], intelligent transportation
    systems [57], wearables [58], supply chain management [59], mobile crowd sensing
    [60], cyber law [61] and security in mission-critical scenarios [62]. FIGURE 4.
    BIoT applications. Show All Blockchain can also be used in IoT agricultural applications.
    For example, in [63] it is presented a traceability system for tracking Chinese
    agri-food supplies. The system is based on the use of Radio Frequency Identification
    (RFID) and a blockchain, being its aim to enhance food safety and quality, and
    to reduce losses in logistics. Other researchers focused on managing IoT devices
    through a blockchain [64]. Such researchers proposed a system able to control
    and configure IoT devices remotely. The system stores public keys in Ethereum
    while private keys are saved on each IoT device. The authors indicate that the
    use of Ethereum is essential, since it allows them to write their own code to
    run on top of the network. Moreover, updating the code on Ethereum modifies the
    behavior of the IoT devices, what simplifies maintenance and bug corrections.
    The energy sector can also be benefited from the application of a blockchain to
    IoT or to the Internet of Energy (IoE) [65]–[67]. An example is detailed in [68],
    where the authors propose a blockchain-based system that allows IoT/IoE devices
    to pay each other for services without human intervention. In the paper it is
    described an implementation that shows the potential of the system: a smart cable
    that connects to a smart socket is able to pay for the electricity consumed. In
    addition, to reduce the transaction fees of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, the
    researchers present a single-fee micro-payment protocol that aggregates several
    small payments into a larger transaction. Healthcare BIoT applications are found
    in the literature as well. For instance, in [69] it is presented a traceability
    application that makes use of IoT sensors and blockchain technology to verify
    data integrity and public accessibility to temperature records in the pharmaceutical
    supply chain. This verification is critical for the transport of medical products
    in order to ensure their quality and environmental conditions (i.e., their temperature
    and relative humidity). Thus, every shipped parcel contains a sensor that transfers
    the collected data to the blockchain where a smart contract determines whether
    the received values remain within the allowed range. Another healthcare BIoT application
    is detailed in [70], where it is presented the architecture of a blockchain-based
    platform for clinical trials and precision medicine. It is also worth mentioning
    the work described in [71], which presents a generic smart healthcare system that
    makes use of IoT devices, cloud and fog computing [72], a blockchain, Tor [73]
    and message brokers. IoT low-level security can also be enhanced by blockchain
    technology. Specifically, it can be improved remote attestation, which is the
    process that verifies whether the underlying Trusted Computer Base (TCB) of a
    device is trustworthy [74]. This verification can be performed by managing the
    TCB measurements obtained by using ARM TrustZone [75] and a blockchain, where
    they are stored securely. Other already proposed BIoT applications are related
    to smart cities [76] and industrial processes [28]. In the case of [76] it is
    proposed a framework that integrates smart devices in a secure way for providing
    smart city applications. In [28], different blockchain-based industrial applications
    are reviewed, including their connection to Industrial IoT (IIoT) networks. Finally,
    it should be mentioned that Big Data can be leveraged by blockchain technology
    (i.e., to ensure its trustworthiness), so some researchers [27] reviewed the main
    blockchain-based solutions to gather and control massive amounts of data that
    may be collected from IoT networks. SECTION IV. Design of an Optimized Blockchain
    for IoT Applications Blockchain technologies can bring many benefits to IoT, but,
    since they have not been devised explicitly for IoT environments, the different
    pieces that make them up should be adapted. In order to optimize them, several
    authors studied BIoT performance in different scenarios. They analyzed a number
    of influential aspects, but they mainly focus on the performance of consensus
    algorithms. An example of performance evaluation is detailed in [77]. Specifically,
    the paper analyzes whether the Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) consensus
    algorithm (described later in Section IV-D) could be a bottleneck in networks
    with a large amount of peers. Actually, the tests described make use of up to
    100 peers that interact with a blockchain based on IBM’s Bluemix. The experiments
    measure the average time to reach a consensus and it can be observed how it grows
    as the number of peers increases. The scalability of Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Byzantine
    Fault Tolerance (BFT) based consensus methods is compared in [78]. The author
    points out that, although Bitcoin has been a clear success, its poor scalability
    makes no sense today, since there are modern cryptocurrency platforms like Ethereum.
    In the paper it is suggested to improve PoW performance by mixing it with a BFT
    protocol. In addition, it is stated that the implementation of the consensus protocols
    in hardware is probably the most promising way for improving the performance of
    any consensus method. Besides the consensus algorithm, other elements of the blockchain
    can be adapted to be used in IoT networks. Thus, in the next subsections the different
    parts of a blockchain are analyzed in order to determine possible optimizations.
    A. Architecture The architecture that supports a blockchain used for IoT applications
    should have to be adapted to the amount of traffic that such applications usually
    generate. This is a concern for traditional cloud-based architectures, which,
    as it is illustrated in Figure 5, evolved towards more complex edge and fog computing-based
    architectures. In such a Figure it can be observed that three architectures depend
    on a cloud, although, in practice, the dependency degree varies a great deal.
    In the case of a cloud-based architecture, the data collected by the Node Layer
    are forwarded directly to the cloud through IoT gateways without further processing
    that the one needed for protocol conversion (in case it is needed). There are
    also gateways that perform more sophisticated tasks (e.g., sensor fusion [79]),
    but in most cloud-centered applications, most processing is carried out in the
    cloud. FIGURE 5. Traditional IoT architecture evolution. Show All However, note
    that traditional cloud-centered IoT architectures have certain inherent vulnerabilities
    [59], being the most relevant the fact that the cloud is a point of failure: if
    the cloud is down due to cyberattacks, maintenance or software problems, the whole
    system stops working. In addition, it is important to emphasize that if a single
    IoT device is compromised, it may disrupt the whole network by performing Denial
    of Service (DoS) attacks [80], eavesdropping private data [81], altering the collected
    data [82] or misleading other systems [83]. Therefore, once an IoT device connected
    to the cloud or to a central server is breached, the rest of the nodes may be
    compromised. In contrast, blockchain-based systems do not rely on a unique central
    server or cloud. Moreover, transactions are verified cryptographically, so when
    malicious activities from a compromised device are detected, the system can reject
    its blockchain updates. The other two architectures depicted in Figure 5 are more
    recent and offload part of the processing from the cloud to the edge of the network.
    This offloading is key for IoT applications, since it is estimated that if the
    number of IoT connected devices keeps on growing at the same rate [1], the amount
    of communications to be handled by a cloud will increase remarkably and, therefore,
    the cloud network capacity will have to be expanded. Thus, Edge and fog computing
    can be used to support physically distributed, low-latency and QoS-aware applications
    that decrease the network traffic and the computational load of traditional cloud
    computing systems. Fog computing is based on a set of local gateways able to respond
    fast to IoT node requests through specific services. Such nodes can also interact
    with each other and, when required, with the cloud (for instance, for long term
    storage). In Figure 5, fog local gateways are represented by Single-Board Computers
    (SBCs), which are low-cost and low-energy consumption computers that can be installed
    easily in a reduced space. Examples of popular SBCs are the different versions
    of Raspberry Pi [84] or BeagleBone [85]. Fog computing is actually considered
    a subset of edge computing [72], which has recently been presented as a valid
    architecture for supporting blockchain and blockchainless DAG IoT applications
    [86]. As it can be observed in Figure 5, in the Edge Computing Layer, besides
    fog gateways there is a cloudlet, which in practice consists in one or more high-end
    computers that act like a reduced version of a cloud. The main advantage of cloudlets
    is that they can provide high-speed responses to compute-intensive tasks required
    by the Node Layer (e.g., running a full node of a blockchain), which cannot be
    delivered effectively when using resource-constrained fog gateways. There are
    other architectures that have been explored in the past in order to tackle the
    architectural issues that arise when providing BIoT services. A brief but good
    compilation of alternatives can be found in [87]. In such a paper the advantages
    and disadvantages of four different architectures (that the authors call Fully
    Centralized, Pseudo-Distributed Things, Distributed Things and Fully Distributed)
    are discussed. The researchers conclude that a BIoT architecture should be as
    close as possible to the Fully Distributed approach, but that, in some scenarios
    where computational power or cost are limiting factors, other approaches may be
    more appropriate. An interesting platform that promotes decentralization for IoT
    systems is IBM’s ADEPT. Such a platform was conceived for secure, scalable and
    autonomous peer-to-peer IoT telemetry. According to the authors, ADEPT is presented
    more as a starting point for discussion than as an implementation, but its white
    paper [88] provides a detailed description on the requirements for the platform.
    For instance, the researchers point out that an IoT device should be able to authenticate
    autonomously and to self-maintain, leaving to the manufacturers the responsibility
    of registering new devices in the blockchain. In addition, ADEPT’s vision of mining
    is different from the one implemented in Bitcoin. Mining is necessary in Bitcoin
    to restrict currency issuance, but IBM considers that such a limitation restricts
    scalability and imposes an increasing computational cost. Therefore, ADEPT uses
    Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and PoW, which guarantee network integrity and security,
    but which do not impose additional limitations. Furthermore, it is worth mentioning
    that IBM’s architecture for ADEPT distinguishes among three types of IoT devices
    (Light Peers, Standard Peers and Peer Exchanges), which differ in their role and
    computational capabilities. Finally, the authors of the white paper indicate the
    software selected for implementing ADEPT (Telehash [89], BitTorrent [90] and Ethereum)
    and describe different practical use cases of the system, like a washer that buys
    detergent automatically when it is low. Another BIoT architecture is proposed
    in [91] and [92]. In such papers the authors devise a theoretical lightweight
    architecture with security and privacy in mind, which reduces the communications
    overhead introduced by the use of a blockchain. The presented system is oriented
    towards home automation and its architecture is divided into three layers: the
    smart home layer, where there are sensors, actuators and local storage; an overlay
    network of peers and shared storage; and a cloud, which also provides remote storage.
    In the lower layers (smart homes and overlay network) storage is composed by traditional
    storage servers and blockchains, either public or private. The reduction in overhead
    is carried out by removing the PoW consensus mechanism, so every block is mined
    and appended to the blockchain without additional efforts. Every transaction is
    also appended to a block and is assumed that it is a true transaction, being the
    owner the one responsible for adding/removing devices. This simplification eases
    the blockchain functioning and, although the researchers studied the impact of
    different attacks on the system, it is not clear that the proposed scheme would
    withstand attacks performed by compromised IoT nodes whose contribution (e.g.,
    collected sensor values), which is assumed to be true by default, may alter the
    behavior of other subsystems. IoT is also gaining traction thanks to its global
    vision where devices are interconnected seamlessly among them and with the environment.
    For such a purpose, in [93] it is presented a theoretical blockchain-based architecture
    focused both on providing IoT services and connecting heterogeneous devices. The
    proposed architecture makes use of hierarchical and multi-layered blockchains,
    which enable building a contextual service discovery system called CONNECT. A
    multi-layer IoT architecture based on blockchain technology is described in [94].
    The proposed architecture decreases the complexity of deploying a blockchain by
    dividing the IoT ecosystem in levels and making use of the blockchain in each
    one. The researchers state that the architecture harnesses both the power of a
    cloud and the security and reliability of the blockchain. A slightly different
    approach is presented in [95], where it is evaluated the use of a cloud and a
    fog computing architecture to provide BIoT applications. The authors indicate
    that the architecture is proposed because is really difficult to host a regular
    blockchain on traditional resource-constrained IoT devices. Thus, the researchers
    measure empirically the performance of the system proposed by using IoT nodes
    based on Intel Edison boards and IBM’s Bluemix as blockchain technology. The obtained
    results show that, under high transaction loads, the fog system latency response
    is clearly faster than in a cloud-based system. Following similar ideas, the same
    authors presented another two works. In [96] they describe the implementation
    of RESTful microservices on the architecture, while in [97] they extend the architecture
    to a paradigm they call the Internet of Smart Things. Another architecture based
    on edge computing is presented in [98], which describes ongoing research on the
    development of a hierarchical and distributed platform based on the IEC 61499
    standard [99], which supports distributed automation control systems. Such systems
    can be structured in two layers: a bottom layer that controls devices and processes,
    and a top layer that supervises the bottom layer. For the top layer, the platform
    uses a blockchain based on Hyperledger Fabric [35] that implements smart contracts
    to perform supervision tasks. The edge nodes conform the bottom layer and are
    based on a micro-service architecture that makes use of Docker containers [100]
    and Kubernetes [101]. Software Defined Networking (SDN) has been also suggested
    for implementing BIoT architectures. For instance, in [102] it is proposed a novel
    blockchain-based architecture that makes use of SDN to control the fog nodes of
    an IoT network. The system makes use of a cloud to perform compute-intensive tasks,
    while providing low-latency data access through fog computing. The fog nodes are
    the ones that are distributed, providing services and interaction with the blockchain.
    The results obtained by the authors indicate that the architecture reduces delays,
    increases throughput and it is able to detect real-time attacks on the IoT network.
    In the specific case of a flooding attack, the architecture is able to balance
    the load between the fog nodes thanks to the use of the blockchain and an SDN
    algorithm. In addition, the same authors describe in [103] a similar SDN-based
    approach. B. Cryptographic Algorithms Public-key cryptography is essential for
    providing security and privacy in a blockchain. However, resource-constraint IoT
    devices struggle with the computing requirements of modern secure cryptographic
    schemes [104]. Specifically, asymmetric cryptography based on Rivest–Shamir–Adleman
    (RSA) is slow and power consuming when implemented on IoT devices [41]. Therefore,
    when choosing the right cryptographic scheme, it should be taken into account
    not only the computational load and the memory requirements, but also the energy
    consumed. The most common public-key based cipher suites are RSA and Elliptic
    Curve Diffie-Hellman Exchange (ECDHE), which are the ones recommended by the National
    Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) [105] for Transport Layer Security
    (TLS) [106]. RSA-based cipher suites use RSA [107] as the key exchange algorithm,
    while the ECDHE-based ones use an algorithm that makes use of Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman
    based on Elliptic Curves [108]. Current RSA key sizes are not practical for most
    IoT devices. A 2048-bit key is the minimum size considered secure, since 768-bit
    and 1024-bit RSA implementations were broken in 2010 [109], [110]. Although possible,
    the use of a 2048-bit certificates on an ephemeral key exchange algorithm introduces
    heavy overhead and computing requirements, which are very difficult to accommodate
    on the constrained hardware capabilities of most IoT nodes. In contrast, Elliptic
    Curve Cryptography (ECC) represents a much lighter alternative to RSA [111], [112].
    It has already been shown that, when implemented on resource-constrained devices,
    ECC outperforms RSA in terms of speed [113]–[115] and power consumption [116]–[119].
    However, note that in August 2015 the National Security Agency (NSA) recommended
    stopping the use of Suite B, an ECC-based algorithm, apparently, because of the
    progress recently made on quantum cryptography [120]. Regarding hash functions,
    they are also key in a blockchain-based system, since they are required to sign
    transactions. Therefore, hash functions for IoT applications have to be secure
    (i.e., they should not generate collisions [121]), fast and should consume the
    smallest possible amount of energy. The most popular blockchain hash functions
    are SHA-256d (used by Bitcoin, PeerCoin or Namecoin), SHA-256 (used by Swiftcoin
    or Emercoin) and Scrypt (used by Litecoin, Gridcoin or Dogecoin). The performance
    of SHA-256 has been evaluated in different IoT devices, like wearables [122].
    However, researchers that evaluated the footprint and energy requirements of SHA-256
    in ASICs, concluded that, for low-power secure communications, it is more efficient
    to make use of Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) [123]. Due to such power limitations,
    other researchers suggested using ciphers like Simon [124], but further research
    and empirical evaluations on real BIoT applications are still needed. C. Message
    Timestamping In order to track modifications on the blockchain, transactions have
    to be both signed and timestamped. This last task should be performed in a synchronized
    way, so timestamping servers are commonly used. Different timestamping mechanisms
    can be used. Traditional schemes rely on having trustworthiness on the server,
    which signs and timestamps transactions with its own private key. Nonetheless,
    no one deters the server from signing past transactions. For such a reason, diverse
    authors have proposed secure mechanisms. For instance, the method implemented
    by Bitcoin is inspired by one of the solutions proposed in [125], where each timestamp
    includes a hash of the previous timestamp, what maintains the order of the transactions
    (even when the clocks are inaccurate) and makes it difficult to insert fake transactions
    in the already linked chain. In addition, timestamping can be distributed, hence
    avoiding the problem of having a single point of failure. Although such a distributed
    system is prone to Sybil attacks [126], Bitcoin solves them by linking blocks
    and using the PoW mechanism. Other authors recently proposed the use of a decentralized
    timestamping service [127] or the distribution of its keys [128], but the topic
    has still to be studied in detail when decentralizing the service among devices
    of an IoT network. D. Consensus Mechanisms, Mining and Message Validation Consensus
    is key for the proper functioning of a blockchain. It basically consists in a
    mechanism that determines the conditions to be reached in order to conclude that
    an agreement has been reached regarding the validations of the blocks to be added
    to the blockchain [26]. In practice, the problem is the Byzantine Generals Problem
    previously described in the Introduction. The most egalitarian (and idealistic)
    consensus mechanism consists in giving to all the miners the same weight when
    voting and then deciding according to the majority of the votes. This scheme may
    be possible to implement in a controlled environment, but, in a public blockchain,
    this mechanism would lead to Sybil attacks, since a unique user with multiple
    identities would be able to control the blockchain [126]. In practice, in a decentralized
    architecture, one user has to be selected to add every block. This selection could
    be performed randomly, but the problem is that random selection is prone to attacks.
    PoW consensus algorithms are based on the fact that if a node performs a lot of
    work for the network, it is less likely that it is going to attack it. Specifically,
    the solution proposed by PoW-based blockchains makes it difficult to perform Sybil
    attacks by requiring miners to perform computationally expensive tasks that, theoretically,
    cannot be carried out by a single entity. The work performed usually involves
    doing some calculations until a solution is found, a process that is commonly
    known as mining. In the case of the Bitcoin blockchain, mining consists in finding
    a random number (called nonce) that will make the SHA-256 hash of the block header
    to have at the beginning certain number of zeroes. Therefore, miners have to demonstrate
    that they have performed certain amount of work to solve the problem. Once the
    problem is solved, it is really easy for other nodes to verify that the obtained
    answer is correct. However, this mining process makes the blockchain inefficient
    in throughput, scalability [78], and in terms of energy consumption, what is not
    desirable in an IoT network. Due to the problems previously mentioned, several
    alternative consensus methods have been proposed. The following are the most relevant:
    PoS is a consensus mechanism that requires less computational power than PoW,
    so it consumes less energy. In a PoS-based blockchain it is assumed that the entities
    with more participation on the network are the ones less interested in attacking
    it. Thus, miners have to prove periodically that they own certain amount of participation
    on the network (e.g., currency). Since this scheme seems unfair, because the wealthiest
    participants are the ones ruling the blockchain, other variants have been proposed.
    For example, Peercoin’s consensus algorithm [129] takes coin age into account:
    the entities with the oldest and largest sets of coins would be more likely to
    mine a block. Because of the advantages of PoS, some blockchains like Ethereum
    are planning to move from PoW to PoS. Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) [130] is
    similar to PoS, but stakeholders instead of being the ones generating and validating
    blocks, they select certain delegates to do it. Since less nodes are involved
    in block validation, transactions are performed faster than with other schemes.
    In addition, delegates can adjust block size and intervals, and, if they behave
    dishonestly, they can be substituted easily. Transactions as Proof-of-Stake (TaPoS)
    [131] is a PoS variant. While in PoS systems only some nodes contribute to the
    consensus, in TaPoS all nodes that generate transactions contribute to the security
    of the network. Proof-of-Activity (PoA) consensus algorithms were proposed due
    to the main limitation of PoS systems based on stake age: it is accumulated even
    when the node is not connected to the network. Thus, PoA schemes have been proposed
    to encourage both ownership and activity on the blockchain [132], rewarding stakeholders
    who participate instead of punishing passive stakeholders. A similar approach
    is proposed by Proof-of-Stake-Velocity (PoSV) [133]. It is implemented by Reddcoin
    [134], which is based on the concept of velocity of money. Such a concept indicates
    how many times a unit of currency flows through an economy and is used by the
    members of a society during a certain time period. Usually, the higher the velocity
    of money, the more transactions in which it is used and the healthier the economy.
    PBFT [135] is a consensus algorithm that solves the Byzantine Generals Problem
    for asynchronous environments. PBFT assumes that less than a third of the nodes
    are malicious. For every block to be added to the chain, a leader is selected
    to be in charge of ordering the transaction. Such a selection has to be supported
    by at least 2/3 of the all nodes, which have to be known by the network. Delegated
    BFT (DBFT) is a variant of BFT where, in a similar way to DPOS, some specific
    nodes are voted to be the ones generating and validating blocks. The Ripple consensus
    algorithm [136] was proposed to reduce the high latencies found in many blockchains,
    which are in part due to the use of synchronous communications among the nodes.
    Thus, each Ripple’s server (i.e., miner) relies on a trusted subset of nodes when
    determining consensus, what clearly reduces latency. Stellar Consensus Protocol
    (SCP) is a implementation of a consensus method called Federated Byzantine Agreement
    (FBA) [137]. It is similar to PBFT but, whilst in PBFT every node queries all
    the other nodes and waits for the majority to agree, in SCP the nodes only wait
    for a subset of the participants that they consider important. BFTRaft [138] is
    a BFT consensus scheme based on the Raft algorithm [139], which is aimed at being
    simple and easy to understand for students. Such an aim makes Raft assume simplifications
    that rarely hold in practice, like the fact that nodes only fail by stopping.
    Thus, BFTRaft enhances the Raft algorithm by making it Byzantine fault tolerant
    and by increasing its security against diverse threats. Sieve [140] is a consensus
    algorithm proposed by IBM Research that has already been implemented for Hyperledger-Fabric.
    Its objective is to run non-deterministic smart contracts on a permissioned blockchain
    that makes use of BFT replication. In such a scenario, Sieve replicates the processes
    related to non-deterministic smart contracts and then compares the results. If
    a divergence is detected among the results obtained by a small number of processes,
    they are sieved out. However, if the number of divergent processes is excessive,
    the whole operation is sieved out. Tendermint [141] is a consensus algorithm that
    can host arbitrary application states and can only tolerate up to a 1/3 of failures.
    In Tendermint, blockchain participants are called validators and they propose
    blocks of transactions and vote on them. A block is validated in two stages (pre-vote
    and pre-commit) and it can only be committed when more than 2/3 of the validators
    pre-commit it in a round. Bitcoin-NG [142] implements a variant of the Bitcoin
    consensus algorithm aimed at improving scalability, throughput and latency. The
    developers performed experiments with 1,000 nodes and concluded that Bitcoin-NG
    scales optimally, only limited by the bandwidth of the nodes and the latency related
    to the propagation time of the network. Proof-of-Burn (PoB) is a consensus method
    that requires miners to show proof of their commitment to mining by burning some
    cryptocurrency through an unspendable address. The idea behind PoB is that, instead
    of burning resources (e.g., energy in the case of many PoW implementations), cryptocurrency
    is burnt as it is considered as expensive as such resources. Proof-of-Personhood
    (PoP) [143] is a consensus mechanism that makes use of ring signatures [144] and
    collective signing [145] to bind physical to virtual identities in a way that
    anonymity is preserved. A very similar concept is Proof-of-Individuality (PoI),
    which is currently being developed on Ethereum by the PoI Project [146]. Finally,
    it is worth noting that private blockchains, which control user access, reduce
    the probability of Sybil attacks, so they do not require costly mining algorithms
    and economic incentives are removed. E. Blockchain Updating/Maintenance and Protocol
    Stack The construction of an IoT network requires deploying a huge number of devices.
    Such devices embed certain firmware that is usually updated to correct bugs, prevent
    attacks [147] or just to improve some functionality. Traditionally, IoT devices
    had to be updated manually or with Over-The-Air (OTA) updates [148]. According
    to some researchers [149] these updates can be performed by using a blockchain,
    which enables IoT devices to spread securely new firmware versions. Regarding
    the protocol stack, some authors suggested changes on the traditional OSI stack
    to adapt it to blockchain technologies. The most relevant is the so-called “Internet
    of Money” (IoM) [150], which proposes a set of five layers that operate on TCP/IP
    (shown in Figure 6). Such five layers include: A Ledger Layer that creates ledgers
    and issues assets. A Payment and Exchange Layer. A Pathfinding Layer that calculates
    the optimal set of atomic operations to be executed for the desired value transfer
    or exchange. A Contract Layer that controls balances through certain running code.
    An Application Layer that allows for developing applications and user interfaces.
    FIGURE 6. IoM versus traditional OSI protocol stack. Show All More research is
    still needed in order to study the need for specific stacks and to analyze their
    performance in comparison to other traditional OSI-based stacks. SECTION V. Current
    Challenges for BIoT Applications Today, emerging technologies in the IoT ecosystem
    like Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) [151]–[153], RFID [154], telemetry systems [155]
    or 4G/5G broadband communications [156], [157] have to face several challenges.
    Specifically, the case of mission-critical scenarios [158] rise additional concerns.
    Adding blockchain to the mix implies further operational and technical requirements
    since the development of BIoT applications is a complex process that is affected
    by many aspects that are interrelated. The main factors are described in the next
    subsections and are depicted in Figure 7. FIGURE 7. Most relevant factors that
    condition the development of a BIoT application and their main relationships.
    Show All A. Privacy All the users of a blockchain are identified by their public
    key or its hash. This means that anonymity is not guaranteed and, since all transactions
    are shared, it is possible for third-parties to analyze such transactions and
    infer the actual identities of the participants [159], [160]. Privacy is even
    more complex in IoT environments, since IoT devices can reveal private user data
    that could be stored in a blockchain whose privacy requirements differ from one
    country to another [161]. Therefore, in contrast to traditional online payments,
    which are usually only visible to transacting parties and to a middleman (e.g.,
    financial institutions, government), the transparent transactions fostered by
    blockchain are a challenge in terms of privacy. Identity certification may also
    be a problem in IoT: if an identity provider is responsible for authorizing entities,
    it can also be able to block them. To address such a challenge, in [162] it is
    proposed the use of a permissioned blockchain for securing and managing multiple
    IoT nodes. The proposed system provides a distributed identity management solution
    that increases security and protection against attacks by rotating asymmetric
    keys. Such keys are generated locally on the device and they are never moved from
    it. To verify the identity of a user while rotating keys, the system makes use
    of a mechanism called Device Group Membership (DGM) that includes in a group all
    the devices that belong to a user and, when a user carries out a transaction,
    it is reflected on the blockchain as it was performed by a device that belonged
    to the user’s group. The proposed solution also enhances security by using a certificate
    system for authentication and by enabling the hash function substitution if it
    is compromised. It is also worth mentioning that the system can be tweaked to
    limit the amount of temporal data stored, which is useful for IoT devices with
    little storage space (for instance, it could only be stored the data from the
    previous 24 hours). Another approach focused on solving the privacy and robustness
    problems derived from using centralized identity management systems is described
    in [92]. There the authors emphasize the need for providing automatic authentication
    systems for IoT applications where scalability is needed and where device heterogeneity
    and mobility are common. To deal with such challenges, the researchers present
    a blockchain-based system for IoT smart homes that extracts appliance signatures
    automatically in order to identify both the appliances and their users. Access
    management to IoT networks is challenging as well. Some researchers [163] suggested
    improving it by defining a blockchain-based multi-level mechanism, which would
    specify capabilities, access lists and access rights. However, note that, in many
    IoT applications anonymity is not necessary, but the privacy of the transactions
    is required in certain scenarios when the collected data may allow for monitoring
    and predicting people behavior or habits. This has already been an issue in fields
    like RFID-based transportation card systems, where the stored information (i.e.,
    trips, balance, personal data) is supposedly anonymous, but in practice it may
    be collected by third parties [164]–[166]. The issue is even more problematic
    when adding a blockchain, since transactions are shared among peers, what in certain
    fields like industry or financial systems, allows for monitoring the activity
    of competitors. Therefore, solutions have to be proposed to mitigate these privacy
    issues. For example, in the case of public blockchains a user does not need to
    know the address of every user, just the one of the counterparty he/she is dealing
    with. If a blockchain participant makes use of a new address for every transaction,
    data analysis would become more difficult. This is similar to what smartphones
    manufacturers have implemented to avoid Wi-Fi tracking [167], [168]. A more practical
    but less anonymous solution would consist in using a unique address for each counterparty.
    In a private blockchain, since access controls are performed, there is at least
    one node that knows who accesses the system. Assuming the neutrality of the access
    controller, it is possible to reduce exposure by establishing an independent blockchain
    with every entity a user is collaborating with. This setup increases communications
    complexity, but isolates the user from non-desired monitoring. For instance, Multichain
    [169] provides a solution for deploying private blockchains (it can work with
    different blockchains at the same time) that ensures that the activities on the
    blockchain can be monitored by chosen participants. Mixing techniques can also
    help to enhance privacy. Such techniques can collect transactions from diverse
    IoT devices and output events or other transactions to different addresses that
    are not linked to the original devices. These techniques increase privacy, but
    they are not perfect, since they may be de-anonymized through statistical disclosure
    attacks [170]. Moreover, the mixing service has to be trusted, since a malicious
    mixer may expose users and, in the case of economic transactions, it may end up
    stealing coins. To tackle these issues different proposals suggested exposing
    theft through an accountability mechanism [171] or hiding the input/output address
    mapping from the mixing server [172]. Privacy can also be increased through zero-knowledge
    proving techniques like the ones used by Zerocoin [173], Zerocash [174] or Zcash
    [175]. A zero-knowledge proof is a method that allows for proving to a counterparty
    that a user knows certain information without revealing such an information [176].
    In the case of IoT applications, zero-knowledge proofs can be used for authentication
    or during regular transactions in order to avoid revealing the identity of a user
    or a device. However, note that these proofs are not immune to attacks [177].
    In fact, like in the case of mixing techniques, they are susceptible to de-anonymization
    through statistical disclosure attacks, but they improve mixing techniques by
    avoiding the necessity for a mixing server, which can pose a security or performance
    bottleneck. It must be also remarked the privacy-focused efforts performed by
    several initiatives like Bytecoin [178] or Monero [179], which are based in CryptoNote
    [180]. CryptoNote is a protocol that makes use of ring signatures and whose transactions
    cannot be followed through the blockchain in order to determine who performed
    them. The only people that can access the transaction information are the parties
    that carry it out or whoever knows one of the two private keys. One of the keys
    of CryptoNote is its implementation of the concept of ring signature [144], which
    makes it possible to specify a set of possible signers without revealing who of
    them actually produced the signature. Another possible solution for preserving
    privacy is the use of homomorphic encryption [181], [182]. Such a kind of encryption
    allows third-party IoT services to process a transaction without revealing the
    unencrypted data to those services. Several researchers have suggested variations
    on the Bitcoin protocol to make use of homomorphic commitments [183], [184]. Finally,
    note that part of the mechanisms previously mentioned require a relevant number
    of computational resources, so its applicability to resource-constrained IoT devices
    is currently limited. B. Security Traditionally, three requirements have to be
    fulfilled by an information system in order to guarantee its security: Confidentiality.
    The most sensitive information should be protected from unauthorized accesses.
    Integrity. It guarantees that data are not altered or deleted by unauthorized
    parties. It is also usually added that, if an authorized party damages the information,
    it should be possible to undo the changes. Availability. Data can be accessed
    when needed. Regarding confidentiality, the part related to the transaction data
    is associated with their privacy, which has been already analyzed in the previous
    subsection. With respect to the infrastructure that supports the stored data,
    it can be stated that current IoT applications tend to centralize communications
    in a server, in a farm of servers or in a cloud. Such an approach is valid as
    long as the administrators of the centralized infrastructure are trusted and while
    the system remains robust against attacks [185], [186] and internal leaks. In
    contrast, blockchain technologies are characterized by being decentralized, so,
    although one node is compromised, the global system should keep on working. For
    an individual user, the key for maintaining confidentiality is a good management
    of his/her private keys, since it is what an attacker needs in conjunction with
    the public key to impersonate someone or steal something from him/her. An interesting
    initiative related to this topic is CONIKS [187], a key management system created
    to liberate users from encryption key management. In such a system the user first
    has to ask for a public key to a provider, which only requires a user name to
    register in the CONIKS system. When a user wants to send a message to another
    user, his/her CONIKS client looks for the counterparty’s key in the key directory.
    In order to avoid key tampering from the service provider (which might become
    compromised), before sending any message, two verifications are performed: it
    is checked that the public key of the receiver is the one used by other clients
    when communicating with the same user, and that such a key has not changed unexpectedly
    over time. Similar solutions have been proposed for IoT devices, making use of
    blockchain technology to strengthen their identity and access management, since
    blockchains provide a defense against IP spoofing and forgery attacks [59]. Certificates
    are also essential when guaranteeing security on the Internet. Therefore, certificate
    authorities that make use of a public-key infrastructure have to provide trust
    to third-parties. However, such authorities have proven to fail in certain occasions
    [188], then having to invalidate certificates previously issued. Some recent initiatives
    are aimed at fixing certain structural flaws found in the SSL certificate system.
    Specifically, Google’s Certificate Transparency [189] provides a framework for
    monitoring and auditing SSL certificates in almost real time. The solution uses
    a distributed system based on Merkle hash trees that allows third-parties to audit
    and verify whether a certificate is valid. With respect to integrity, it must
    be indicated that the foundations of a blockchain are designed to store information
    that cannot be altered (or that it is very costly to do it) once it is stored.
    Nonetheless, note that in the past there were certain situations when this principle
    was ignored. For instance, in 2014, in an event that it is still to be clarified,
    the currency exchange platform MintPal notified its users that a hacker had stolen
    almost 8 million Vericoins, what was about 30% of the total coins of such a platform.
    To prevent the loss of investor funds and the fact that an actor would control
    30% of the coin’s proof-of-stake network capacity, the Vericoin developers decided
    to hard fork the blockchain, reversing the damage (a hard fork is a permanent
    divergence from the previous version of the blockchain). Therefore, although many
    information sources indicate that blockchains are a permanent storage for data
    that cannot be altered, it is actually not true in practice for preserving integrity
    in very exceptional cases. In IoT applications, data integrity is also essential
    and it is usually provided by third-parties. To avoid such a dependence, in [190]
    it is proposed a data integrity service framework for cloud-based IoT applications
    that makes use of blockchain technology, thus eliminating the need for trusting
    such third-parties. The third characteristic of security is availability, but
    it is actually the most straightforward to be fulfilled by blockchains, since
    they are conceived by design to be distributed systems, what allows them to keep
    on working even when some nodes are under attack. Nevertheless, availability can
    be compromised through other types of attacks. The most feared attack is a 51-percent
    attack (also called majority attack), where a single miner can control the whole
    blockchain and perform transactions at wish. In this situation, data are available,
    but the availability for performing transactions can be blocked by the attacker
    that controls the blockchain. Obviously, this kind of attack also affects data
    integrity. C. Energy Efficiency IoT end-nodes usually make use of resource-constrained
    hardware that is powered by batteries. Therefore, energy efficiency is key to
    enable a long-lasting node deployment. However, many blockchains are characterized
    by being power-hungry. In such cases most of the consumption is due to two factors:
    Mining. Blockchains like Bitcoin make use of massive amounts of electricity due
    to the mining process, which involves a consensus algorithm (PoW) that consists
    in a sort of brute force search for a hash. P2P communications. P2P communications
    require edge devices that have to be powered on continuously, which could lead
    to waste energy [191], [192]. Some researchers proposed energy efficient protocols
    for P2P networks [193]–[195], but the issue still has to be studied further for
    the specific case of IoT networks. Regarding mining, some authors suggested that
    the power consumed by proofs of work could be used for something useful while
    providing at the same time the required PoW [196]. Obtaining such proofs should
    have certain degree of difficulty, while its verification should be really fast.
    Some initiatives based on blockchains, like Gridcoin [197], reward volunteer scientific
    research computing with coins (although, as a consensus algorithm, Gridcoin uses
    PoS). Another interesting example is Primecoin [198], whose PoW mechanism looks
    for chains of prime numbers. Thus, a massive infrastructure like the one involved
    in IoT could also be harnessed to solve problems while making use of a blockchain.
    Proof-of-Space (PoS) (also known as Proof-of-Capacity (PoC)) has also been suggested
    as a greener alternative to PoW [199]. PoS systems require users to show a legitimate
    interest in a specific service by allocating certain amount of memory or disk.
    This mechanism has already been implemented by cryptocurrencies like Burst-coin
    [200]. Other consensus methods have been proposed to reduce energy consumption
    respect to PoW, like Proof-of-Stake or Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (both
    described in Section IV-D). In relation to P2P communications, they are essential
    for a blockchain to communicate peers and distribute blocks, so the more updates
    a blockchain receives, the more energy consumption is dedicated to communications.
    To reduce the number of updates, mini-blokchains [201] may allow IoT nodes to
    interact directly with a blockchain, since they only keep the latest transactions
    and lower the computational requirements of a full node. In terms of hashing algorithms,
    SHA-256 is the reference due to being the one used by Bitcoin, but new algorithms
    like Scrypt [202] or X11 [203] are faster and thus can reduce mining energy consumption.
    Other hashing algorithms have been suggested, like Blake-256 [204], and some blockchains
    are able to make use of different hashing algorithms (e.g., Myriad [205]), but
    further analyses should be carried out on the performance and optimization of
    modern hash functions to be used on IoT devices. D. Throughput and Latency IoT
    deployments may require a blockchain network able to manage large amounts of transactions
    per time unit. This is a limitation in certain networks. For instance, Bitcoin’s
    blockchain has a theoretical maximum of 7 transactions per second [78], although
    it can be increased by processing larger blocks or by modifying certain aspects
    of the node behavior when accepting transactions [206]. In comparison, other networks
    are remarkably faster. For instance, VISA network (VisaNet) can handle up to 24,000
    transactions per second [207]. Regarding latency, it is important to note that
    blockchain transactions take some time to be processed. For example, in the case
    of Bitcoin, block creation times follow a Poisson distribution with a 10-minute
    mean [18], although, for avoiding double-spend, merchants are recommended to wait
    for about an hour, since five or six blocks usually need to be added to the chain
    before the transaction is confirmed. This latency requires only a few seconds
    in the case of VISA [207]. In relation to the consensus latency, it can be stated
    that the complexity of the consensus process is more important in terms of latency
    than individual hashing, but different blockchains, like the one that supports
    Litecoin [34], have opted for using scrypt, a hashing algorithm that is slightly
    faster than SHA-256. E. Blockchain Size, Bandwidth and Infrastructure Blockchains
    grow periodically as users store their transactions, what derives into larger
    initial download times and in having to make use of more powerful miners with
    larger persistent memories. Blockchain compression techniques should be further
    studied, but the truth is that most IoT nodes would not be able to handle even
    a small fraction of a traditional blockchain. Moreover, note that many nodes have
    to store large amounts of data that are of no interest for them, what can be regarded
    as a waste of computational resources. This issue could be avoided by using lightweight
    nodes, which are able to perform transactions on the blockchain, but who do not
    have to store it. However, this approach requires the existence in the IoT hierarchy
    of certain powerful nodes that would maintain the blockchain for the resource-constrained
    nodes, what implies a certain degree of data centralization. Another alternative
    would consist in the use of a mini-blockchain [183], [201]. Such a kind of blockchain
    introduces the use of an account tree, which stores the current state of every
    user of the blockchain. Thus, only the most recent transaction has to be stored
    on the blockchain together with the account tree. Therefore, the blockchain only
    grows when new users are added to the blockchain. In addition, note that transaction
    and block size have to be scaled according to the bandwidth limitations of IoT
    networks: many small transactions would increase the energy consumption associated
    with communications, while a few large ones may involve big payloads that cannot
    be handled by some IoT devices. Regarding the infrastructure, certain elements
    are required to make the blockchain work properly, including decentralized storage,
    communication protocols, mining hardware, address management or network administration.
    Part of these needs are being fulfilled by the industry progressively, creating
    specific equipment for blockchain applications. For instance, miners have evolved
    from simple CPU-based systems, to more sophisticated equipment that harnesses
    the power of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), Field-Programmable Gate Arrays
    (FPGAs) or Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) [208]. F. Other Relevant
    Issues 1) Adoption Rate One of the factors that may prevent a wide adoption of
    a BIoT application is the fact that a blockchain enables pseudo-anonymity (i.e.,
    users or devices are identified by addresses, but they are not clearly linked
    to them). Governments may demand a strong link between real-world and online identity.
    Moreover, since IoT transactions can be carried out internationally, it may not
    be clear who should perform the identification. In addition, note that the value
    and security of a blockchain increases with the number of users, also being more
    difficult to perform the feared 51-percent attacks. Moreover, note that miner
    adoption rate also influences the capacity of a network to process transactions,
    so, in a BIoT deployment, the computational power brought by miners should be
    high enough to handle the transactions received from the IoT devices. 2) Usability
    In order to ease the work of developers, blockchain access Application Programming
    Interface (APIs) should be as user-friendly as possible. The same should be applied
    to the APIs to manage user accounts. 3) Multi-Chain Management In some cases,
    the proliferation of blockchains has derived into the necessity of having to deal
    with several of them at the same time. This can also happen in an IoT scenario,
    where, for instance, sensor values may be stored in a private blockchain, while
    financial transactions among nodes that provide services may be supported by Ethereum’s
    or Bitcoin’s blockchain. 4) Versioning and Forks Blockchains can be forked for
    administrative or versioning purposes. Once a blockchain is forked, it is not
    easy to carry out transactions between both chains. 5) Mining Boycott Miners end
    up deciding which transactions are or are not stored in the blockchain, so they
    are able to censor certain transactions for economic or ideological reasons. This
    issue can happen when the number of conspiring miners are above 51 percent of
    the total, so small chains and blockchains that delegate their decisions on a
    subset of miners are susceptible to this kind of boycotts. Therefore, miners have
    to be chosen wisely and, when smart contracts have been signed, misbehaviors should
    be sanctioned. 6) Smart Contract Enforcement and Autonomy Legal rules have still
    to be developed to enforce smart contracts and resolve disputes properly. Some
    work is being performed for binding real-world contracts with smart contracts
    [161], but this is still an issue to be further studied. SECTION VI. Further Challenges
    and Recommendations Despite the promising benefits and the brilliant foreseen
    future of BIoT, there are significant challenges in the development and deployment
    of existing and planned systems that will need further investigation: Complex
    technical challenges: there are still issues to be addressed regarding the scalability,
    security, cryptographic development and stability requirements of novel BIoT applications.
    Moreover, blockchain technologies face design limitations in transaction capacity,
    in validation protocols or in the implementation of smart contracts. Furthermore,
    methods to solve the tendency to centralized approaches should be introduced.
    Interoperability and standardization: the adoption of BIoT will require the compromise
    of all stakeholders in order to achieve full interoperability (i.e., from data
    to policy interoperability) and integration with legacy systems. The adoption
    of collaborative implementations and the use of international standards for collaborative
    trust and information protection (i.e., access control, authentication and authorization)
    will be needed. For instance, authentication across multiple authorities or organizations
    requires Federated Identity Management (FIM) [209]. At an international scale,
    such a FIM currently exists only at a low Level of Assurance (LoA). The required
    LoA (from LoA 1 to LoA 4), as defined by the ISO/IEC 29115:2013 standard, is mainly
    based on risks, on the consequences of an authentication error and/or the misuse
    of credentials, on the resultant impact, and on their likelihood of occurrence.
    Thus, higher LoAs will be needed. Blockchain infrastructure: it will be needed
    to create a comprehensive trust framework or infrastructure that can fulfill all
    the requirements for the use of blockchain in IoT systems. Many state-of-the-art
    approaches that address issues such as trust depend on inter-domain policies and
    control. For instance, the governments should set up a blockchain infrastructure
    to support use cases of public interest. Organizational, governance, regulatory
    and legal aspects: besides technological challenges, shaping the regulatory environment
    (i.e., decentralized ownership, international jurisdiction) is one the biggest
    issues to unlock the potential value of BIoT. For instance, it is possible that
    some developers fake their blockchain performance in order to attract investors
    driven by the expected profits. Rapid field testing: in the near future, different
    types of blockchains for diverse applications will need to be optimized. Moreover,
    when users want to combine blockchain with IoT systems, the first step is to figure
    out which blockchain fits their requirements. Therefore, it is necessary to establish
    a mechanism to test different blockchains. This approach should be split into
    two main phases: standardization and testing. In the standardization phase, after
    a wide understanding of the supply chains, markets, products, and services, all
    the requirements have to be analyzed and agreed. When a blockchain is created,
    it should be tested with the agreed criteria to verify if the blockchain works
    as needed. In the case of the testing phase, different criteria should be evaluated
    in terms of privacy, security, energy efficiency, throughput, latency, blockchain
    capacity or usability, among others. SECTION VII. Conclusions The transition to
    a data-driven world is being accelerated by the pace of the technological advances
    of an Internet-enabled global world, the rise of societal challenges, and an increasing
    competition for scarce resources. In this ecosystem, blockchain can offer to IoT
    a platform for distributing trusted information that defy non-collaborative organizational
    structures. This review examined the state-of-the art of blockchain technologies
    and proposed significant scenarios for BIoT applications in fields like healthcare,
    logistics, smart cities or energy management. These BIoT scenarios face specific
    technical requirements that differ from implementations involving cryptocurrencies
    in several aspects like energy efficiency in resource-constrained devices or the
    need for a specific architecture. The aim of this work was to evaluate the practical
    limitations and identify areas for further research. Moreover, it presented a
    holistic approach to BIoT scenarios with a thorough study of the most relevant
    aspects involved in an optimized BIoT design, like its architecture, the required
    cryptographic algorithms or the consensus mechanisms. Furthermore, some recommendations
    were provided with the objective of giving some guidance to future BIoT researchers
    and developers on some of the issues that will have to be tackled before deploying
    the next generation of BIoT applications. We can conclude that, as in any technological
    innovation, there is no one-size-fits-all solution for a BIoT application. Nevertheless,
    the adoption of the paradigm opens a wide area of short- and medium-term potential
    applications that could disrupt the industry and probably, the economy, as we
    know it today. The global reality is a complex mix of different stakeholders in
    the IoT ecosystem, therefore it is necessary to reassess the different activities
    and actors involved in the near-future economy. We can conclude that BIoT is still
    in its nascent stage, and beyond the earliest BIoT developments and deployments,
    broader use will require additional technological research advances to address
    the specific demands, together with the collaboration of organizations and governments.

    IEEE Conference Location: Coimbatore, India SECTION I. INTRODUCTION The security
    of blockchain technology comes from the fact that the information is known by
    the \"public.\" Every transaction in the blockchain has to be approved by a majority
    of the blocks that are involved in it, and it can never be completely erased from
    the network [1]. Smart farming means using the new technologies that have come
    out at the start of the Fourth Industrial Revolution in agriculture and cattle
    production to increase the quantity and quality of production while making the
    best use of resources and having the least impact on the environment. The growing
    number of people in the world shows how important agriculture and farming are
    for growing and making enough food for everyone. Most countries'' economies depend
    a lot on how well they do in agriculture [3] [8]. The use of blockchain-based
    authentication can be an effective method for protecting IoT devices employed
    in smart farming. IoT devices allow farmers to keep tabs on things like temperature
    and soil moisture in order to better manage their farms. However, Internet of
    Things (IoT) devices are susceptible to cyber-attacks that can cripple their performance
    and endanger the farm''s operations. Using blockchain-based authentication is
    one approach to ensuring the safety of Internet of Things devices. To ensure that
    only authorized devices have access to the system, blockchain technology provides
    a decentralized and tamper-proof method of verifying the identity of these devices.
    The first step in implementing blockchain-based authentication for smart farming
    is giving each Internet of Things device its own distinct identity. To achieve
    this, it is possible to give each gadget its own special identification number
    and record it in the distributed ledger. To gain entry, devices must first provide
    their unique identifier, which is then checked against a distributed ledger (blockchain)
    of authorized devices. One more benefit of blockchain-based authentication is
    that it can offer a trustworthy and clear method of monitoring the actions of
    Internet of Things (IoT) gadgets. A farmer, for instance, can use blockchain technology
    to confirm that an Internet of Things device has carried out a certain action,
    like watering a plant, and that it has been carried out accurately. All things
    considered; blockchain-based authentication can be a potent tool for securing
    IoT devices used in smart farming. This system helps farmers better manage their
    operations by providing a secure and decentralized method of verifying the identity
    of devices and tracking their activities. In this paper, we look at possible to
    use blockchain technology and Radio Frequency Identification in cattle farming.
    These technologies could be used to keep track of important information and get
    it to the right people quickly. With this project, we hope to find a better way
    to handle this business''s information and update its infrastructure. Blockchain-based
    authentication for Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices in smart farming can solve
    several problems, including [10]: Data integrity: IoT devices generate a lot of
    data that is critical to smart farming operations. Blockchain-based authentication
    can help ensure the integrity of this data by preventing unauthorized devices
    from altering or corrupting it. Traceability: Blockchain-based authentication
    can provide a tamper-proof record of all IoT devices that access the network,
    which can help with traceability in the event of a security breach or other issue.
    Transparency: Smart farming involves multiple stakeholders, including farmers,
    processors, distributors, and consumers. Blockchain-based authentication can enhance
    transparency by providing a shared, immutable record of all IoT devices that access
    the network, which can help build trust between stakeholders. Efficiency: Blockchain-based
    authentication can help streamline the authentication process for IoT devices
    in smart farming by eliminating the need for intermediaries such as authentication
    servers, which can reduce costs and increase efficiency. Figure 1: RFID Cattle
    Flow Chart Show All Figure 1, we have shown how to RFID Cattle flow. A. Trade
    of between Blockchain storage and Cloud storage Cloud storage is the traditional
    way to store data. The biggest problem with cloud storage is that all the data
    is kept in one place and isn''t usually encrypted when transactions are made.
    Blockchain storage is an alternative to centralised store and in compare to the
    cloud storage that could be cheaper, safer, and more reliable. Every day, people
    who use cloud storage have to deal with cyber security. Providers of centralised
    cloud storage make copies of the data and store them in different data centres
    so that the data doesn''t get lost. When this happens, a lot of information is
    duplicated, which can lead to too much extra information. Also, the data centres
    that house cloud storage need high-end equipment. When it comes to data security,
    cloud storage relies on third parties. It uses the Software as a Service, Platform
    as a Service, and Infrastructure as a Service models to offer services. Blockchain
    storage is a decentralized, distributed ledger technology that provides a secure
    and immutable way to store data. Blockchain technology offers several benefits,
    including increased security, transparency, and reliability. On the other hand,
    blockchain makes sure that data is safe and correct without relying on third parties.
    In our work data are not very large so what even disadvantages with Blockchain
    that is not applicable there. The choice between blockchain storage and cloud
    storage ultimately depends on the specific needs and requirements of the user.
    If security and immutability are top priorities, then blockchain storage may be
    the best option. However, if scalability and accessibility are more important,
    then cloud storage may be the better choice. B. Motivations Using the Internet
    of Things (IoT) and Blockchain technology together makes it easier to keep an
    eye on fields. Using IoT and Blockchain technology to manage and coordinate, a
    good monitoring system is made. The Blockchain network is set up to keep information
    safe and help community members trust each other. use blockchain technology to
    find out who a user is. Smart systems have changed how industries work by making
    it possible to automate data collection, data sharing, monitoring, and responding
    to changes in the environment [2]. In smart IoT environments, IoT devices are
    usually set up to collect data and send it to a server to be processed and stored.
    Authorized users can use the collected data to take action and make decisions
    in different IoT applications. So, it is very important to authenticate end-user
    devices so that only authorized users can access cloud data. Even though the studied
    schemes provide authentication for end-user devices in IoT systems, they have
    several security flaws and are not as good as they could be [4] [5]. SECTION II.
    RELATED WORK Blockchain can be used in the livestock trade. But there are a few
    articles that talk about how RFID has changed the cattle business over the last
    20 years. Proposed a system based on RFID technology in which medical and physical
    information about animals is stored in a local database that farmers and veterinarians
    can access with mobile devices [8]. also suggested that RFID tags could be used
    in dairy farms to help reduce the amount of manual labour needed to keep track
    of information about each animal [9]. They also talk about how keeping an eye
    on how each cow''s temperature changes can help find signs of illness or a drop
    in milk production. Combining Blockchain technology with the Internet of Things
    (IoT) could take agriculture to the next level, allowing for more precise supply
    chain management and optimisation. The combination of blockchain technology and
    the Internet of Things will lead to improved visibility and management of agricultural
    operations [1]. Several Internet of Things (IoT) applications have already been
    built with blockchain. All of these studies demonstrate that incorporating blockchain
    technology into IoT applications enhances safety [13]. Since there hasn''t been
    a lot of prior work done on blockchain technology''s potential applications in
    the farming industry, our preliminary findings are novel in conceptual design
    and should inspire additional study in this area. We hope that by publishing these
    preliminary results, we can inspire further study in this area in the years to
    come [15]. A. Blockchain & Smart Contracts for IoT Blockchain is a type of distributed
    database that keeps track of a list of records that is always growing and is organized
    into things called blocks. Blockchain is a chain of these blocks, as the name
    suggests. Each block is linked to the one before it by a hash of the block before
    it. Contracts that are written in code and stored on a blockchain are called \"smart
    contracts.\" You can use them to automate transactions and make sure people follow
    the rules. IoT that works with GPS can also be used to make smart contracts that
    run automatically when certain conditions are met [14]. In this paper, discuss
    about how blockchain could be used with IoT devices. They talk about how IoT devices
    could work in a decentralized way with the help of blockchains. Instead of deploying
    everything from one place. It talks about how a Smart Farming using smart contracts
    and the Ethereum blockchain. It also talks about how IoT and blockchain can be
    used to use and share energy in the energy sector in a smart way. Problem Identification
    A blockchain-based smart application was implemented to securely store security-anomaly
    information and proactively mitigate similar attacks targeting other farms in
    the community. Via Block Chain based authentication and details will give us farming
    to grow and produce food. SECTION III. ARCHITECTURE In this section, we present
    our architecture for our blockchain-based IoT livestock tracking system. We give
    an overview. Our main components of the system are as follows [6] [7]: Device
    Registration: On the blockchain, each IoT device used in the smart farming system
    must be registered. This is done by giving each device a unique identifier and
    putting it on the blockchain. This step makes sure that only devices that are
    allowed to access the system can do so. Deploying Smart Contracts: Smart contracts
    are used to set the rules and conditions for getting into the system. The authentication
    process is enforced by these contracts that are put on the blockchain. Before
    letting the device into the system, the smart contract will check the device''s
    ID. Authenticating the device: When a device tries to get into the smart farming
    system, it must first give its unique identifier. The smart contract will then
    check the blockchain to make sure that the device is registered and allowed to
    access the system. Transaction Validation: Before letting the device into the
    system, the smart contract will check that the transaction started by the device
    is valid. This makes sure that the device only does things that are allowed. Data
    Storage: The blockchain is used to store data made by IoT devices, such as data
    about the environment. This makes sure that the data can''t be changed and is
    clear, giving an unchangeable record of what the device did. Device Management:
    The blockchain-based authentication system can also be used to manage devices.
    For example, if there is a security breach or the device breaks down, access to
    the device can be taken away. In smart farming, using blockchain-based authentication
    for IoT devices means registering devices on the blockchain, using smart contracts
    to enforce the authentication process, verifying device identity, validating transactions,
    storing data, and managing devices A. PROCESS Our process of tracking cattle.
    We''ve implemented a method where all relevant information is stored and accessible
    by designated authenticated members of the cattle farm in light of the exponential
    growth of data on cattle farms over time. The blockchain itself is put to use
    as a safeguard, with the hash of the relevant data being fully exploited to ensure
    the data''s integrity. Accessibility is a key feature of blockchain technology,
    and there are two varieties available: public and private. The main distinction
    between them is whether or not new users can join the chain without the existing
    users'' approval. A public blockchain, like the one on which Bitcoin operates,
    allows anyone to view its contents without the intervention of a central authority
    [11] [12]. Here, we introduce a secure blockchain system for internal use. This
    decision was driven by the project''s ultimate goal of helping ranchers exercise
    greater control over their own livestock. This means that the private blockchain
    only needs to be accessible to the authenticated users. TABLE 1: Information saved
    with Dummy Data B. Formal Process In general, the following steps make up a formal
    process for doing anything in a Blockchain-based Authentication system for IoT
    devices in smart farming: Authentication Request: The user tells the blockchain-based
    authentication system to do something by sending an authentication request. The
    action the user wants to take and the device identifier are both included in the
    request. Smart Contract Verification: The smart contract on the blockchain checks
    the user''s identity and the device identifier to make sure the user is allowed
    to do what is being asked. If the user is allowed, the next step will be taken
    by the smart contract. Action Execution: The user is now allowed to use the IoT
    device to do the requested action. For example, the user might want to turn on
    the irrigation system. The smart contract starts the action on the device, and
    the device does the action that was asked of it. Data Logging: After the action
    is done, the system writes information about it to the blockchain. This information
    includes the user who started the action, the identifier for the device, and the
    action that was done. This makes sure that there is a clear and unchangeable record
    of everything that happens in the system. Action Completion: When the action is
    done, the user is told whether it was successful or not. Device Management: The
    blockchain-based authentication system can also be used to manage devices. For
    example, if there is a security breach or the device breaks down, access to the
    device can be taken away. The administrator can use the system to manage devices
    in a way that is similar to what was explained above. Overall, a Blockchain-based
    Authentication system for IoT devices in smart farming requires an authentication
    request, smart contract verification, action execution, data logging, action completion,
    and device management to take any kind of action. These steps make sure that only
    authorized users can make changes to the system, and that all changes are recorded
    on the blockchain so that they can''t be changed. Blockchain technology can be
    a promising approach for decentralized authentication in IoT networks for cattle
    farming. When buying or selling cattle, it is important to verify the ownership
    of the cattle to ensure that the transaction is legitimate. Blockchain-based authentication
    can provide a secure and tamper-proof way to verify the original owner of the
    cattle. C. Working Unique Identifiers: Each cattle can be assigned a unique identifier
    that is recorded on the blockchain. This identifier can be a combination of RFID
    tags, QR codes, or other identification methods. Ownership Transfer: When cattle
    are sold, the ownership transfer is recorded on the blockchain as a transaction.
    This creates a tamper-proof and transparent record of ownership transfer that
    can be verified by anyone on the network. Traceability: The blockchain-based authentication
    system can also provide traceability of the cattle''s movement and health information.
    This information can be stored on the blockchain and accessed by authorized parties
    such as veterinarians or government officials. This can be particularly useful
    in case of theft or accidents, as it can help in the recovery and investigation
    process. Decentralization: The decentralized nature of blockchain technology ensures
    that there is no single point of failure, making it difficult for hackers or malicious
    actors to tamper with the data. Key Benefits: Tamper-resistant records. Decentralized
    Authentication. Verify ownership transfer. Reducing the risk of fraud or theft.
    Security: Blockchain technology provides a highly secure way to authenticate IoT
    devices. Each device has a unique identity stored on the blockchain, which cannot
    be tampered with. This helps to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches.
    Transparency: The decentralized nature of blockchain technology means that every
    transaction is transparent and can be traced back to its source. This can be useful
    in the case of a security breach or if there is a need to audit the system. Trust:
    Blockchain-based authentication can help to build trust between different parties
    involved in the smart farming system. For example, farmers can be sure that the
    data they receive from IoT devices is accurate and reliable, while consumers can
    be sure that the food, they buy has been grown using sustainable and ethical farming
    practices. Efficiency: By using blockchain-based authentication, smart farming
    systems can reduce the need for manual authentication processes, which can be
    time-consuming and prone to errors. Cost-effectiveness: Blockchain-based authentication
    can be a cost-effective solution for smart farming systems, as it eliminates the
    need for expensive third-party authentication services. Blockchain-based authentication
    can help to ensure that the data collected by these devices is accurate, secure,
    and tamper-proof. Overall, blockchain-based authentication can provide many benefits
    for smart farming applications, including improved security, transparency, trust,
    efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. Overall, the use of blockchain-based authentication
    in IoT networks for cattle farming can provide a secure and transparent way to
    verify ownership transfer, provide traceability, and ensure data integrity. This
    can help improve the efficiency and security of cattle farming operations while
    also reducing the risk of fraud or theft and blockchain networks to create tamper-resistant
    records of shared transactions. SECTION IV. CONCLUSION In this study, blockchain-based
    authentication in Smart Farming is discusses with IoT applications, research works
    are continuously finding new ways to apply it on society and lifestyle. This study
    takes advantage of this study''s findings and the credibility they inspire in
    cattle to usher in a more practical and technologically advanced future. The current
    infrastructure for rural livestock is one reason why blockchain technology is
    an intriguing development worth further investigation, which inspired the work
    presented here. Here the cattle informations are stored in the block chain, which
    is secure, when authentication of information is needed, it can be done easily.
    If there is any government assistance for any specific type of cattle, it is easy
    to find the details, and can directly transfer the benefits to the owner. As blockchain
    technology is still in its early stages, researchers are constantly coming up
    with novel uses for it in daily lives. In order to encourage cattle to begin moving
    towards a more practical and technologically advanced future, this study attempts
    to capitalise on the qualities and credibility this study generates. Preliminary
    study shown here is driven by the outdated infrastructure that now exists in rural
    cattle infrastructure, which makes blockchain technology an intriguing innovation
    deserving of further exploration. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords

  description: Real-time identification of irrigation water pollution sources and
    pathways (PSP) is crucial to ensure both environmental and food safety. This study
    uses an integrated framework based on the Internet of Things (IoT) and the blockchain
    technology that incorporates a directed acyclic graph (DAG)-configured wireless
    sensor network (WSN), and GIS tools for real-time water pollution source tracing.
    Water quality sensors were installed at monitoring stations in irrigation channel
    systems within the study area. Irrigation water quality data were delivered to
    databases via the WSN and IoT technologies. Blockchain and GIS tools were used
    to trace pollution at mapped irrigation units and to spatially identify upstream
    polluted units at irrigation intakes. A Water Quality Analysis Simulation Program
    (WASP) model was then used to simulate water quality by using backward propagation
    and identify potential pollution sources. We applied a “backward pollution source
    tracing” (BPST) process to successfully and rapidly identify electrical conductivity
    (EC) and copper (Cu2+) polluted sources and pathways in upstream irrigation water.
    With the BPST process, the WASP model effectively simulated EC and Cu2+ concentration
    data to identify likely EC and Cu2+ pollution sources. The study framework is
    the first application of blockchain technology for effective real-time water quality
    monitoring and rapid multiple PSPs identification. The pollution event data associated
    with the PSP are immutable.

    This study uses an integrated framework based on the Internet of Things (IoT)
    and the blockchain technology that incorporates a directed acyclic graph (DAG)-configured
    wireless sensor network (WSN), and GIS tools for real-time water pollution source
    tracing. Water quality sensors were installed at monitoring stations in irrigation
    channel systems within the study area. Irrigation water quality data were delivered

    with the PSP are immutable. Keywords: Internet of Things; pollution source trace;

    wastewater discharge due to rapid industrialization has resulted in heavy metal
    contamination in farmlands via irrigation channels. It is a severe threat to the
    environment, agricultural production, and public health [1,2,3]. Although rapid
    identification of irrigation water pollution sources and pathways (PSP) is key
    to managing irrigation water quality for agricultural production, it is an extremely
    difficult task in agricultural areas that are located within industrialized areas
    [4,5,6]. A real-time water quality monitoring network can collect water quality
    information at set (or at network) locations in real-time (or at regular intervals)
    and can provide monitoring data for both current status analysis and water quality
    trend forecasts. Potential pollution sources can then be identified [7,8], enabling
    the emergency disposal of pollutants in contaminated areas [9]. Moreover, a system
    that allows PSP tracing is essential to providing authorities with real-time documentation
    that narrows the scope of likely pollution sources for rapid identification and
    isolation of irrigation water pollution and pathways; and for protecting agricultural
    production environments. Furthermore, real-time identification and isolation of
    PSP are necessary for water quality management and control actions [6,8]. Pollution
    event data should be secured for further actions such as tracing and recording
    PSP without risk of data tampering. Recently, blockchain technology has been widely
    utilized in many fields such as healthcare for medical data [10,11]; food production
    tracing [12,13]; and has been proposed for application to irrigation water resource
    management [6,14]. Blockchain technology provides significant security advantages
    such as user authentication through public keys and digital fingerprints, data
    immutability, and transaction transparency with traceability characteristics [15,16].
    Since all transactions use hash functions and use hash values as fingerprints,
    a blockchain ensures that data cannot be changed. Critical information storage
    (e.g., pollution event data) and transactions can be delegated to the blockchain,
    while endpoint devices or platforms can remain ‘dumb’, untrusted, and require
    very little maintenance [17]. Blockchain technology’s robust consensus-based security
    architecture that does not require a central certifying authority also renders
    it particularly suitable for the authentication of ownership rights [17,18]. Accordingly,
    blockchain transaction records can reference uploaded and secured data [19,20].
    Currently, the two most used blockchain transaction models are the unspent transaction
    output (UTXO) model and the account-based model. Just as blockchain technology
    used with Internet of Things (IoT) technology provides a way to trace a product’s
    lifecycle from raw materials used, to end production [21]; these technologies
    can be used to trace a pollution event from the pollution source, through its
    pathways, to the polluted area. Blockchain technology used with IoT and sensor
    networks, however, can potentially identify PSP. Moreover, pollution event data
    can be secured by blockchain technology. Integrating effective real-time tools
    with real-time water quality monitoring data can improve the identification of
    irrigation PSP. Wireless sensor networks (WSN) have been developed using various
    sensors in different fields in order to provide high-quality real-time remote
    monitoring data [22] since traditionally conducted field investigations are often
    time-consuming and labor-intensive. In agriculture studies, WSN has been used
    for monitoring environmental conditions; scheduling irrigation based on real-time
    network data; controlling environmental conditions and parameters to improve cropping
    processes, and improving production quantity and quality [23,24]. A water quality
    simulation program using WSN data, however, can also be a useful tool to effectively
    predict point source pollution in irrigation channels since the location, time,
    and source (i.e., source tracing) of water quality contamination can be determined
    using sensor data [6,25,26]. Furthermore, a water quality sensor network with
    WSN can collect application-oriented data, and provide real-time information for
    agricultural and environmental monitoring [6]. Wireless sensor networks with blockchain
    technology then provide an effective way to identify and isolate PSP. Still, a
    real-time irrigation water quality monitoring system with WSN, which is also a
    geographic information system (GIS), could simultaneously monitor irrigation water
    quality and quantity, spatially identify pollution sources, and track source locations.
    Recently, GIS, Global Positioning System (GPS) technology, and WSN have been utilized
    in various fields such as agriculture systems monitoring, flood risk analysis
    prediction, and urban systems monitoring [27,28]. This is because GIS technology
    is a powerful tool for spatial and temporal data analysis that has already been
    widely applied to identify contaminants in surface water [29,30,31]. Once a likely
    pollution area is identified with GIS, authorities can focus their investigation
    on the sources within the vicinity of the polluted wastewater discharge (e.g.,
    specific factories). Additionally, different deterministic, stochastic, and statistical
    models have also been used, at regionally and local scales, to identify various
    PSP through agricultural irrigation channels [4]. For example, the Water Quality
    Analysis Simulation Program (WASP), developed by the US Environmental Protection
    Agency, is a dynamic compartment-modeling program for aquatic systems. In the
    last two decades, WASP has been applied in several environmental studies to estimate
    impacts of nutrient loads on agricultural activities; or to examine the fate and
    transport of environmental pollutants [25,32]. The model, however, has been widely
    used in water quality simulation including surface water heavy metal concentration
    simulations [33,34,35]; and can be used to structure one-, two-, and three-dimensional
    models to help users interpret and predict water quality responses to natural
    phenomena and man-made pollution, for various pollution management decisions [36].
    Users can also use the model to develop new kinetic and reactive structures. Industries
    have been occasionally implicated in discharging wastewater into irrigation channels
    in some of Taiwan’s agricultural areas [1]. Expressly, Lin et al. indicated that
    pollutants, such as heavy metals, may be delivered through irrigation channels
    into certain paddy fields in Taiwan. The aim of this study then is to develop
    a GIS integrated blockchain-based traceability system in order to identify PSP
    with a “blockchained” irrigation WSN. Furthermore, we simulated pollution concentration
    using WASP to trace wastewater discharge concentrations from highly likely pollution
    sources at irrigation units within our study area. The computational complexity
    analysis was done by using the big O notation. 2. Materials and Methods This study
    employs a “backward pollution source tracing (BPST)” process to identify PSP.
    We developed a framework for pollution source tracing comprised of an IoT real-time
    monitoring system with sensors which form a WNS (Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3
    and Figure 4) arranged as a directed acyclic graph (DAG); a blockchain real-time
    data tracing platform; a GIS spatial tracing tool; and a WASP model (Figure 1).
    Real-time water quality data are monitored and delivered by the IoT system, as
    shown in Figure S1 (see Supplementary). If the monitored water quality exceeds
    the regulation standard, then blockchain tracing processes are triggered, and
    real-time monitoring data are used to trace the pollution pathway. The GIS spatial
    tracing tool then uses a GIS-based irrigation channel system data to verify and
    spatially trace the pollution pathway. Finally, the WASP model simulates pollution
    concentrations along the pathway, from the sensor intake location to the pollution
    source. Figure 1. Flowchart of the data uploading process for the identification
    of pollution events and potential sources. Note: Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG);

    between monitoring stations as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) with the corresponding
    topological sort order (a) stream system, (b) DAG, (c) Sort. The concentrations
    of pH, temperature, Electrical Conductivity (EC), Cadmium (Cd), Copper (Cu2+),
    Zinc (Zn), Nickel (Ni), and Lead (Pb) in irrigation water have been measured by
    the sensors. The proportions of the above measurements greater than the regular
    standards are presented in Figure S1. The EC and Cu2+ concentrations were frequently
    greater than the regulation standards during our study period (Figure S1). Moreover,
    high EC and Cu2+ concentrations have also been reported in previous investigations
    that include the local irrigation association in the study area [6]. Accordingly,
    EC and copper ion (Cu2+) concentration data from April 2018, indicating irrigation
    water quality in excess of the regulation standards, were selected as real-time
    monitoring system examples for the proposed framework. The data were subjected
    to the BPST process in order to identify potential pollution sources. The blockchain-based
    system was developed using G-Coin [37] The system issues a license to an address
    which becomes a pollution coin issuer in this study. If the water concentrations
    are greater than the standard allows, the pollution coin issuer “mints” a digital
    coin and sends the coin to the station address. Since EC and Cu2+ were considered
    the two focal pollutants for this study, two types of pollution coins were issued
    in the system. Transaction inputs and outputs with regard to the blockchain real-time
    tracing platform are shown in Figure 1. In the blockchain transaction records,
    an “address” refers to one of two kinds of addresses used, namely “station address”
    and “collection address”, both of which either send or receive “pollution coins”
    at each transaction. A station address receives pollution coins and sends coins
    to upstream station addresses that are polluted. There is a one-to-one relationship
    between a monitoring station and its station address so that each monitoring station
    refers to a unique station address. When a monitoring station’s real-time water
    quality concentration data exceeds the regulation standard, a transaction between
    its downstream monitoring station (or coin issuer) and its station address is
    generated: the datum is time-stamped, thereby marking the collection address (and
    point in time hereafter “time point”) that all issued “pollution coins” were sent
    to the station address for future analysis. Collection addresses are stations
    that receive pollution coins and record the time point for the pollution event.
    That is, when a time point is triggered, thus marking a collection address, a
    station address is then generated. Figure 1 is a flow chart of the transaction
    process, which is divided into two stages: pre-processing and station operations.
    The system completes a full round of this uploading process for each time point
    generated. In the pre-processing phase, station addresses are sorted. When a time
    point is triggered, pollution coins are issued, thus linking pollution coins to
    the station address (hereafter, “coin address”), and sha256 hash values are generated
    and recorded in UNIX time as private keys that correspond to the coin address.
    Sorting is a necessary first step since the system runs from downstream stations
    to upstream stations. For this reason, a DAG of the stations is made according
    to the upstream-downstream station relationships. The DAG is defined as follows:
    ‘if there is an edge (u, v) that exists in graph G, then u will be prior to v’
    [38]. The vertices of the DAG are monitoring stations, and the edges are the irrigation
    waterways that connect two stations, with the directed edge in the opposite direction
    of water flow. The resulting outcome sorts downstream stations first. The WSN
    is also a DAG. Finally, computational complexity of the proposed approach is evaluated
    using Kahn’s algorithm of the big O notation [38,39]. An example of multiple pollution
    sources using our blockchain with a DAG approach is also provided in the Supplementary
    section. Details of the big O notation can be found in Avigad and Donnelly [39]
    and Chivers and Sleightholme [40]. 2.1. Study Site and Experiment Design The study
    area is the Taoyuan irrigation district, as shown in Figure 3. The heavy metal
    sensors were installed and working with the other regular sensors in the network
    based on all pre-investigation information and communications with the local irrigation
    society. Moreover, all information on the industrial plants in the study area
    was investigated before the installations of the sensors. Two types of sensors
    were installed in the study area, automatic heavy metal sensors (M) and regular
    sensors (R). The WSN consists of seven sensors: M02, R04, R06, R07, R09, R10,
    and R12 (Figure 3). The irrigation water quality standards for EC and Cu2+ are
    750 µS/cm 25 °C and 0.2 ppm, respectively. The “regular monitoring stations” referred
    to in this study are PRO series monitoring stations equipped with basic water
    quality analyzers including pH, conductivity, ORP, dissolved oxygen, turbidity,
    and suspended solids. The devices connect directly via an RS485 communication
    interface and provide simple, reliable, cost-saving process data with remote monitoring,
    calibration, configuration, and diagnostics capabilities. The devices are housed
    in a robust IP68 proof enclosure, with a 1500 N tensile-strength Kevlar reinforced
    cable, and can support up to a 1.2 km digital data transmission. The transmitter
    is ideal for use in the water/wastewater industry. The basic principle for measuring
    EC, pH, temperature, and liquid level are briefly described as follows: (1) Conductivity:
    two plates (cells) are placed in the sample, a potential is applied across the
    plates and the current is measured. Generally, the potential is in the form of
    a sine wave. Conductivity is determined from the voltage and current values according
    to Ohm’s Law: 𝐺= 1 𝑅 = 𝐼 𝐸 (1) Since the charge on the ions in solution facilitates
    the conductance of electrical current, the conductivity of a solution is proportional
    to its ion concentration. There is a potential difference between the signal produced
    and measured by the sensing and reference electrodes. The theoretical potential
    at pH 7 is 0 mV, and the slope of the line is −59.16 mV/pH at 25 °C. This means
    that, in theory, the pH sensor will change its output by 59 mV for every change
    in a pH unit. The relationship between the potential and hydrogen ion activity
    in the sample is described by the Nernst equation: 𝐸= 𝐸 0 +0.05916×𝑝𝐻 (2) where
    E0 is Reference potential. The temperature was measured by a Resistor Temperature
    Detector (RTD) sensor. In an RTD, the resistance is proportional to the temperature.
    RTD also requires an external current source to function properly. However, the
    current produces heat in a resistive element causing an error in the temperature
    measurements. The error is calculated by this formula: Δ𝑇=𝑃×𝑆 (3) where T is temperature,
    P is I squared power produced, and S is a degree C/mill watt. The liquid level
    was determined using a submersible pressure transducer by taking a continuous
    pressure measurement from the bottom of the tank. The pressure is proportional
    to the height of the liquid directly above it. In addition to the regular monitoring
    stations, the Modern Water OVA 7000 was used as heavy metal monitoring stations
    to analyze the concentration of Cu, Pb, Cu, Zn, and Ni; based on the operations
    of the voltammetry principle, with a detection limit down to μg/L level, similar
    to ICP-MS. Furthermore, the Modern Water OVA 7000 (London, United Kingdom) accuracy
    avoids the interference of watercolor, turbidity, and conductivity, in order to
    meet the requirement of the Taiwan Council of Agriculture’s ‘Irrigation Water
    Standard’. This method had been approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection
    Agency (EPA). The basic principle for measuring heavy metals is briefly described
    as follows. The anodic stripping voltammetry (ASV) method was used for measuring
    heavy metals. Generally, ASV is considered the most sensitive electroanalytical
    technique and suitable for the determination at trace levels of many metals and
    compounds in clinical and industrial environmental samples. In brief, the principle
    of ASV is based on the measurement of current signals associated with molecular
    properties or interfacial processes of the chemical species and is used in the
    detection and quantitative determination of metals or metal complexes, especially
    heavy metals in water. The framework of the monitoring system with the proposed
    approach is shown in Figure 1. Moreover, the blockchain and GIS frameworks are
    also shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2. 2.2. Structure of the Blockchain Traceability
    System Used in This Study Blockchain is a relatively new technology and the basis
    for many cryptocurrency transactions such as Bitcoin (https://bitcoin.org). A
    blockchain is a distributed ledger allowing all users to record transactions in
    a decentralized data log built on a peer-to-peer internet. The data in this ledger
    cannot be tampered with since all transactions are approved by consensus and are
    also encrypted. The user accesses the blockchain network and uploads information
    to the blockchain where it is also stored, via a node. This study developed four
    nodes in a blockchain network using a UTXO-based approach, where outputs of one
    transaction are the inputs of another information set. Each information set can
    be viewed as either a transaction input (TxIn) or transaction output (TxOut),
    thus making transactions trackable. A blockchain is a distributed ledger of transactions
    maintained by a network of untrusted nodes in which each block of the blockchain
    contains a list of transactions organized in a Merkle tree, as new blocks are
    added to the blockchain by users [6,16]. Information in the blockchain ledger
    consists of numerous transactions, so that transaction histories are disclosed.
    In this study, recording water quality and tracing a pollution source is similar
    in principle to a Bitcoin transaction. A coin representing pollution is sent from
    the affected downstream location to upstream locations, where the pollution events
    might have originated. In this way, the pollution data at one location, in relation
    to another location, is stored as an ordered transaction. Specifically, when a
    monitoring station detects pollution, the station is issued a “pollution coin”.
    If pollution is detected at an upstream location, coins from downstream locations
    are sent to the upstream monitoring station. This transaction process records
    the marked pathway of pollutant transportation and identifies the pollution source.
    In addition, based on the time when the pollution is initially detected, pollution
    coins are issued and sent to station addresses as recorded and time-stamped transactions.
    We used the Gcoin (GCoin, 2017) blockchain in our traceability system application.
    The letter G in Gcoin refers to ‘global governance’ of the blockchain network.
    The Gcoin programming code is rewritten from Bitcoin and uses a UTXO-based blockchain
    network. Importantly, Gcoin can track transactions similar to the way that Mint
    (https://www.mint.com) can track Bitcoin transactions. Gcoin-client offers a remote
    procedure call (RPC) protocol to send queries. Therefore, we use Python programming
    language to connect Gcoin-client and to complete data upload and extraction processes.
    2.2.1. Uploading Water Quality Data to the Blockchain Traceability System Figure
    4 illustrates the locations of stations at both upstream and downstream areas
    in the upper and lower parts of the Figure, respectively, as well as the DAG of
    station locations. For example, though water flows from C to D, the DAG edge along
    this pathway is from D to C (Figure 3). While the graph illustrates the topological
    sort calculated with Kahn’s Algorithm [41], one should note that the topological
    sort depicted is not limited to only one solution (Figure 3). After the pre-processing
    phase, based on the sorting order, water quality monitoring data of each station
    are read to verify if values have exceeded the regulation standard. If values
    have not exceeded the regulation standard, then the operation proceeds to the
    next station. If values have exceeded the regulation standard, however, then the
    following steps are executed: (1) Determine if there are coins in the station
    address ledger. If there are coins in the ledger, areas downstream of this station
    are polluted as well, and the pollution coins in the station address ledger can
    then be used directly rather than for sending additional coins to other stations;
    (2) If there are no coins in the station address ledger, then this station is
    downstream of the pollution event, and will be sent coins by the station address
    that was initially issued a pollution coin; (3) If stations upstream of the station
    address that was initially issued a pollution coin are polluted as well, then
    the pollution event is assumed to originate in the upstream area, and pollution
    coins are sent to the upstream stations; (4) If the upstream stations are not
    polluted, then this station address is considered the origin of the pollution
    event, and coins from this station address are sent to the collection address
    for the recording time point of the event and pollution pathways. The data uploading
    procedure is shown in Figure 1. For each transaction, an “OP_RETURN” output is
    included that records 75 bytes of information string. It is via this mechanism
    that the actual observed values (i.e., high EC and Cu2+ concentrations) and generated
    time points are transformed into information strings stored in the blockchain.
    2.2.2. Extracting Information from the Blockchain Traceability System Pollution
    conditions at specific time points can be inspected using the following steps:
    (1) Identify the collection address of the time point; (2) Examine the list of
    pollution coins associated with the identified station address, and (3) Analyze
    the transaction records of these coins. An advantage of using blockchain is that
    it allows us to easily search the transaction history of every pollution coin.
    Because of this, we can rapidly identify pollution sources and affected areas.
    Figure 4 illustrates the mechanisms involved in a blockchain transaction record
    of pollution coins. In this example, our blockchain traceability system issues
    two coins associated with the same time point once pollution data are detected,
    which are then passed to the station addresses. The transaction record of the
    first pollution coin issued progresses from the coin issuer → Station C (station
    address) → Station B (station address) → collection address. The transaction record
    of the second pollution coin issued progresses from the same issuer → Station
    F (station address) → collection address. Stations B, C, and F are station addresses
    in the traceability system. Since the two pollution coins originate at Stations
    B and F, the transactions can be interpreted as follows: “two pollution events
    occurred at a specified time point in the upstream area of Stations B and F”.
    The pollution coin sent from Station B to the collection address, however, actually
    originated from Station C. The transactions are therefore interpreted as: “the
    pollution event occurred at Station B, then affected Station C which is downstream
    of Station B”. Furthermore, since pollution coins originating from Station C were
    sent from Station C to Station B; and since pollution coins originating from Station
    F were sent to the collection address, then “Station C and F are at the bottom
    of the downstream area affected by this pollution event.” The collection addresses
    are final addresses for the pollution events (Figure 5). Therefore, pollution
    pathways can be identified by the above procedure. Figure 5. Example of the blockchain
    transaction record of pollution coins. 2.3. Tracking Pollution Sources with GIS
    In the Taoyuan irrigation district study area, the local water utility administration
    is the responsible authority for irrigation water resources management. Due to
    a limited number of sensors, after using blockchain to trace monitoring station
    transactions, we mapped the Taoyuan irrigation district irrigation unit with GIS
    as a first step to track the pollution source with GIS. Upstream and downstream
    relationships were determined by the direction of flow through the irrigation
    channels, based on the DAG analysis. Mapping the study area’s local water utility
    administrative area with GIS allowed us to identify nearby administrative areas
    along the irrigation canal, as well as relevant irrigation and farmland information,
    such as drainages and other hydraulic structures (Figure 6). Second, we mapped
    factories that were identified as likely pollution sources according to information
    derived from our blockchain traceability system. Third, we mapped additional spatial
    layers of information on water monitoring stations, soil survey data, and factory
    characteristics to conduct further analysis of the industrial factories identified
    as likely pollution sources and their related polluted areas. Lastly, we compared
    the type of pollution detected by our blockchain traceability system, with the
    factory characteristics of the industrial factories screened in the last step,
    to eliminate irrelevant industrial factories. Figure 6. Spatial distributions
    and irrigation flow with monitoring stations in the study area. Note: R is a regular
    water monitoring station; M is a heavy metal monitoring station. In this study,
    we integrated a blockchain traceability system with GIS to track pollution sources
    in the San–Kuai–Tsuo irrigation channel, the 3rd branch of the Taoyuan Canal within
    the Taoyuan irrigation district study area (Figure 6). Figure 7 shows the pollution
    pathways using the traceability system. Using a drainage tracking function on
    the internet platform (Figure 1), we designated impacted areas (orange color)
    and upstream areas (purple color) based on irrigation units (Figure 8). Figure
    S2 shows the DAG of the study. Figure 7. Procedure trees for four monitoring stations

    2.4. Simulation of Wastewater Discharge Quality The Water Quality Analysis Simulation
    Program model is a mass balance equation developed by the US EPA [36].for dissolved
    constituents of the water body, which accounts for all the material entering and
    leaving through direct and diffuse loading; advective and dispersive transport;
    and physical, chemical, and biological transformations [36]. We used WASP (US
    EPA) Version 7.3 to simulate EC and Cu2+ concentration in wastewater discharge
    from industrial factories within the Taoyuan irrigation district study area. The
    data used for the WASP simulation were collected by field investigation and water
    quality monitoring stations. We used Manning’s equation to calculate the flow
    rate in the irrigation canal, and incorporated Cu2+ concentrations that were measured
    in water and sediment, to conduct the simulation. The partial differential equation
    with the Runge–Kutta method was used for the simulation: Water quality control
    equation [36]: ∂𝐶/∂𝑡+∂𝑈𝐶/∂𝑥−∂( 𝐸 𝑥 ∂𝐶/∂𝑥)/∂𝑥−∂( 𝐸 𝑍 ∂𝐶/∂𝑧)/∂𝑧= 𝑆 𝐿 + 𝑆 𝑘 (4) Sediment
    control equation: ∂𝐶/∂𝑡−∂( 𝐸 𝑧 ∂𝐶/∂𝑧)/∂𝑧= 𝑆 𝑘 (5) where U is flow velocity of
    the x-direction (m/s); C is contaminant concentration (g/m3); Ex and EZ are x-
    and z-direction dispersion coefficients (m2/s); SL is external load (g/m3/s);
    and SK is source and sink (g/m3/s). The San–Kuai–Tsuo irrigation channel was divided
    into 32 segments (Table S7). The length of the channel is 3838 meters, with a
    slope of 0.002. The WASP model irrigation channel parameters for model calibration
    were established based on field survey results (see Supplementary). Heavy metals
    emitted from likely sources in the upstream area are traced by utilizing the heavy
    metal monitoring station data on EC concentration, Cu concentration, and water
    level. Model parameters are listed in Table S1 (see Supplementary). Given real-time
    measurements of EC and Cu2+ at the identified water intake (downstream), the WASP
    model simulates the EC and Cu2+ concentrations at all segments along the above
    irrigation channel by using an iteration procedure. The iteration procedures are
    not stopped until the simulated concentrations of EC and Cu2+ at the intake of
    irrigation water are close to those of the measured concentrations. The Mean Absolute
    Percent Error (MAPE Equation (S1) see Supplementary) values of model validations
    for EC and Cu2+ were 9.58% and 3.74%, respectively. Moreover, the R2 values of
    model validations for EC and Cu2+ were 0.9986 and 0.9682, respectively (Figure
    S2 in Supplementary). The MAPE and R2 values show that the simulation model has
    the ability to simulate EC and Cu2+ concentrations. 2.5. Computational Complexity
    In this study, we assumed that the total monitor station number is V (R + M, R:
    number of regular water monitor stations, M: number of heavy metal water monitor
    stations). The total number of edges (which connect the stations) is E. Additionally,
    assume that the DAG is using an adjacency list in which each node stores the outgoing
    edges. By using Kahn’s algorithm: Step 1: Make an AdjList with the current in-degree
    of each node and initialize the count of visited nodes as 0. Step 2: Make a queue
    of the set of nodes with in-degree 0 (Enqueue operation). Step 3: Remove a vertex
    from the queue (Dequeue operation) and then: Increment count of visited nodes
    by 1. Reduce in-degree by 1 for all nodes adjacent to it. If the in-degree of
    an adjacent node is reduced to zero, then add it to the queue. Step 4: Repeat
    Step 3 until the queue is empty. Step 5: If the count of visited nodes is not
    equal to the number of nodes in the graph, then the topological sort is not possible
    for the given graph. In addition, pollution conditions at specific time points
    can be inspected using the following steps: (1) Identify the collection address
    of the time point; (2) Examine the list of pollution coins associated with the
    identified station address, and (3) Analyze the transaction records of these coins.
    The Algorithm 1 for the above pollution analysis algorithm is as follows. Algorithm1:
    Pollution Analysis Algorithm. Pollution Analysis { Identify the collection address
    of the time point //step 1 Sc = set of all pollution coins; For each c ∈ Sc {//step2
    & step 3 Generate pollution pathway Pc for c’s transition record. Analyze Pc to
    determine which is the pollution source //the pollution source is at the upstream
    of the sources in Pc, // the other is pollution path. } } 3. Results 3.1. Uploading
    Water Quality Data to the Blockchain Traceability System Figure S3. Shows the
    DAG of the stream system. The EC and Cu2+ results for 14 water monitoring stations
    are categorized as either “exceeding” or “non-exceeding” regulation standards,
    for which there are 30 combinations (Tables S8 and S9). In this study, there were
    ten instances (Tables S10–S19) in which water monitoring stations were categorized
    as exceeding regulation standards for EC and Cu2+ concentrations (Tables S8 and
    S9). The water quality data upload procedures for these ten cases are shown in
    Tables S10–S19 (Supplementary). The blockchain results for the ten cases of pollution
    pathways (Tables S10–S19) are summarized as the following four types of pollution
    pathways: Type I are cases 1–2 (based on Tables S10 and S11); Type II is case
    3 (based on Table S12); Type III is case 4 (based on Table S13); and Type IV are
    cases 5–10 (based on Tables S14–S19). For the above four pathway types for which
    pollution coins were issued, Figure 7 shows the pollution pathways based on the
    blockchain transaction data as procedure trees. Blockchain transaction data in
    Figure 7 can be read from right to left--downstream stations on the right-hand
    side of the procedure tree are sent to upstream stations on the left-hand side
    of the procedure tree, along various pathways comprised of irrigation channels
    (Figure 7). In Figure 7, water monitoring stations are represented as circles,
    and color-filled circles represent water monitoring stations that detected irrigation
    water pollution concentrations exceeding the regulation standard. For instance,
    since the EC concentration detected at Station R04 was greater than the regulation
    standard, Station R06 received pollution coins from Station R04 in the blockchain
    traceability system (Figure 7). At the same time, Station M02 received pollution
    coins from Stations R10 and R12, since the EC concentrations detected at Stations
    R10 and R12 exceeded the regulation standard. Moreover, Station R09 also issued
    a pollution coin since the detected EC concentration exceeded the regulation standard,
    though no pollution coins were sent to or from Station R09 (Figure 7). These transaction
    “data pathways” cannot be tampered with in the blockchain traceability system.
    With respect to heavy metal results, during our study period, there were ten cases
    in which Cu2+ concentrations exceeded regulation standards and were recorded as
    having concentrations of 0.358 ppm, 0.595 ppm, 0.482 ppm, 0.429 ppm, 0.299 ppm,
    0.271 ppm, 0.209 ppm, 0.226 ppm, 0.393 ppm, and 0.316 ppm, respectively. Detailed
    data uploading procedures for each case can be found in the Supplementary Materials
    (Tables S10–S19). Since only two heavy metal monitoring stations were installed
    in the study area, heavy metal results from these two water monitoring stations
    were categorized as either “exceeding” or “non-exceeding,” for which there are
    two combinations representing two pathway types (Table S9 and Figure 7). For each
    combination, Type II (Table S9) occurs most often. Occurrence times for each combination
    are presented in Figure 7. Unknown pollution sources were detected in the upstream
    area of the study area using downstream monitoring data. For Type II, only Station
    M02 exceeded the Cu2+ concentration regulation standard. According to the operation
    order (i.e., topological sort order), the pollution progresses along the following
    pathway: R04, R06, R07, R10, R12, and M02 (Figure 7). In this study, an example
    of multiple pollution sources was provided in the Supplementary section. Figure
    S4 shows the network of the example with two types of pollution sources, and consists
    of 11 heavy metal sensors (see Supplementary). Figure S4 also shows the upstream-downstream
    relationships between monitoring stations with the corresponding topological sort
    order. Using our approach (Figure 1), pollution progresses along the following
    pathways presented for the multiple pollution sources displayed in Figure S5 (see
    Supplementary). The pollution type #1 has a simple pathway through Station D that
    leads to the pollution source, but the pollution type #2 has three pathways that
    lead to pollution sources (Figure S5). 3.2. Mapping Industrial Factories Identified
    as Likely Pollution Sources with GIS After mapping local water utility administrative
    areas with GIS, we mapped pollution sources identified by the blockchain traceability
    system with real-time monitoring data. To reflect the current irrigation system
    delineated with GIS, upstream irrigation units are depicted in red (Figure 8).
    Since we used a limited number of wireless sensors to monitor irrigation water
    intake, we pinpointed the polluted irrigation units located within the administrative
    area instead, and marked these irrigation units with violet-colored water drop
    symbols in GIS (Figure 8). For instance, Station M02 received pollution coins
    from Stations R10 and R12 in the blockchain traceability system (Figure 8a) when
    the EC concentrations at Stations R10 and R12 exceeded the regulation standard.
    We then identified highly likely sources of pollution at target irrigation units
    within the Taoyuan irrigation district, by narrowing down the likely sources along
    the pollution pathway (i.e., from downstream water monitoring stations to the
    originating stations); and then to the industrial factories in this vicinity (Figure
    8a). Using GIS tools, upstream irrigation units and pollution intake locations
    are thus identified (Figure 8a). Moreover, we can further identify the likely
    pollution sources—specific industrial factories—from various GIS graphic layers
    with aerial photography and farmland monitoring data. The GIS mapped results for
    the ten cases are summarized in Figure 8 as five types of spatial pathways. That
    is, these ten cases are the same spatial pathway types depicted in Figure 7. Specifically,
    Type I are cases 1–3 (based on Tables S10–S12); Type II is case 4 (based on Table
    S13); Type III are cases 5, 7, 9, and 10 (based on Tables S14, S16, S18 and S19);
    Type IV is case 6 (based on Table S15); and Type V is case 8 (based on Table S17).
    3.3. Simulation of Wastewater Discharge Quality A water monitoring station was
    located 200 m downstream from one of the likely pollution sources. Data collected
    from this station was used for simulating wastewater discharge quality. During
    the field investigation, we found that the shape of the irrigation channel was
    an inverted trapezoid, with a total length and head loss of 3838 m and 19.89 m,
    respectively. We input all required measured data (e.g., flow and water depth)
    from the ten abovementioned cases into WASP, to simulate wastewater discharge
    quality. Figure 8 and Figure 9 show the WASP model-simulated trends for EC and
    Cu2+ concentrations. The simulations show that increasing concentration trends
    are potentially caused by a likely pollution source (Figure 9 and Figure 10),
    since concentrations rapidly jump in all cases where the irrigation water quality
    exceeds regulation standards for EC and Cu2+. Figure 9. Reverse prediction of
    EC concentrations along the channel for each case at heavy metal monitoring station

    (i) 0.393 ppm, and (j) 0.316 ppm. 3.4. Computational Complexity In this study,
    we conducted a simple complexity analysis for our pollution analysis algorithm
    with the following. By using Kahn’s algorithm, the time complexity of sorting
    the DAG is O(V + E). Step 1 takes O(V) time to identify the collection address
    of the time point. We need O(V × E) for executing Step 2 and Step 3 of our approach
    (Figure 1), i.e., there are V nodes and, for each node, we need to spend O(E)
    for examining the pollution pathway and identify the pollution source. Therefore,
    the total time complexity of our pollution analysis algorithm is O(V × E). For
    the case of Figure 3, there are 12 monitor stations in the stream system. Since
    there are 12 nodes and 12 edges in the DAG, the computational complexity is O(12
    × 12). If there are n polluted stations, the computation complexity is O(V × E
    + n). In the real case, computational complexity was done and discussed for the
    DAG, Blockchain transaction and WASP modeling by using the big O notation to analyze
    time complexity. The total time complexity of our pollution analysis algorithm
    is O(14 × 10 + n) in the study case. The relationship between Blockchain transactions
    and the number of polluted stations (sensors with concentrations greater than
    the regulation standards) show increasing linear trends (Figure 11). Once n stations
    are polluted, the least number of transactions is n + 1, and the maximum number
    of transactions is 2n (Figure S3). In the two pollution sources designed case,
    the total computational complexity is O(11 × 10 + 7) since the number of polluted
    stations is 7. Figure 11 indicates that the number of transactions strongly relies
    on the number of sensors with concentrations greater than the regulation standards.
    Since the WASP model is a deterministic model, the computation is the model computation.
    The computational times of the model increased from 4, 137, 142, and 180 min for
    the cases with numbers of segments increased from 32, 93, and 128, respectively.
    Figure 11. Big O notation analysis of the relationship in the number of Blockchain
    transactions and the number of polluted stations. 4. Discussion 4.1. Uploading
    Water Quality Data to the Blockchain Traceability System This study is the first
    to utilize blockchain technology with a WSN in a DAG configuration to identify
    pollution pathways and to trace pollution sources based on real-time irrigation
    water quality data. Pollution tracing in this way was possible only with blockchain
    technology’s characteristic immutability, traceable transactions, and transparency
    [6,10]. As a result, the real-time pollution data used in this study cannot be
    altered. Additionally, pollution dispersion can be identified with this study’s
    use of pollution coins, issued by the blockchain traceability system, so that
    transactions can be traced through the irrigation systems with a DAG to identify
    polluted pathways in our study area. Although the issued pollution coins were
    not actual commercially-traded currency, the concept of pollution coins can be
    further utilized in water quality management schemes. Our approach differs from
    traditional WSN uses, in that the proposed blockchain-based approach uses a WSN
    as a DAG to sort the network, based on the spatial relationships between water
    monitoring stations in the study area. While our traditional client-service model
    was developed based on a time series of the water monitoring data from a station
    suited for Structured Query Language (SQL) protocols, the water quality measurement
    data that exceed regulatory standards have been recorded in this study’s blockchain
    and should not be altered since the data are verifiable evidence that can be used
    for further actions. Moreover, blockchain encryption prevents any data manipulation
    of the monitoring data in this study, even when water quality data and events
    are transferred among monitoring stations. That is, the historical and real-time
    events used in this study were transferred as hash values (i.e., digital fingerprints)
    because the data are managed by a peer-to-peer network for inter-node communication,
    making it immutable. The recorded blockchain events in this study are transparent,
    traceable, and secured data that can then be utilized for water quality management.
    Future studies employing our blockchain tracing procedure should include additional
    sensors set at suitable upstream channels within the irrigation unit to overcome
    any issues due to a lack of upstream water monitoring station data if there are
    no budgetary issues. On the other hand, the proposed approach can be a tool to
    reduce the number of sensors and cost for the installation of too many sensors.
    Our results in the example case also indicated that the proposed approach could
    be utilized for multiple types of pollution. 4.2. Mapping Industrial Factories
    Identified as Likely Pollution Sources with GIS Unlike other relevant studies
    using GIS to identify potential pollution or risk zones [29,32,33], this study
    developed a blockchain-based GIS system for real-time identification of polluted
    upstream irrigation units, via a WSN within irrigation channels in the study area.
    Due to a limited number of sensors in the study area, the upstream to downstream
    irrigation units were fixed in a basic spatial relationship, using GIS tools (Figure
    8). Our method, however, can be applied to complex networks as a cost-effective
    method for determining sensors within a network. The upstream unit used in this
    study, for the cases in which EC and Cu2+ concentrations exceeded the regulation
    standard, is a real-world upstream unit. Although copper is essential to the growth
    of plants, soil copper concentrations in excess (i.e., beyond a threshold of 400
    mg/kg for rice) have inhibitory effects on crop growth and development [42], suggesting
    a need for real-time water pollution monitoring. GIS techniques used in this study
    differ from other blockchain WSN techniques used to spatially identify polluted
    irrigation units reported by [31,43]. Our use of a GIS tracking procedure, initiated
    directly after the blockchain process, effectively identifies polluted upstream
    irrigation units and irrigation water intake locations in the study area for real-time
    water quality modeling. Furthermore, using GIS tools can reduce sensor installation,
    sensor maintenance, and water monitoring station costs if operating under a limited
    budget. 4.3. Simulation of Water Quality for Real-Time Pollution Source Tracking
    Water quality models or indices that are GIS-based have been widely developed
    to assess water quality and to identify potential pollution source risk and risk
    areas [44,45]. In the last two decades, the WASP has been successfully used to
    simulate the arrival time of pollutants from various locations and concentrations
    after water pollution accidents, as dynamic GIS layers [32]. This study utilized
    the WASP model for successful reverse prediction of EC and Cu2+ concentrations
    with real-time water quality monitoring data and real-time pollution source tracing
    via a WSN in the study area. In order to trace pollution sources in real-time,
    our proposed approach auto-initiates once EC and Cu2+ concentrations exceed regulation
    standard allowances. Unlike studies that only use a WSN approach [46,47], this
    study used blockchain technology transaction functions and a DAG. Although we
    readily concede that our model traced a pollution source that was within relatively
    proximity to a monitoring station (within a 200 m radius), increasing the sensor
    amount and performing model calibrations based on a longitudinal data set will
    improve traceability of large-scale unknown pollution sources when using the proposed
    framework. However, overcoming potential modeling challenges may require clarification
    on the flow directions between upstream and downstream drainage areas, water monitoring
    station locations, and irrigation facility and channel information. 4.4. Computational
    Complexity As far as we know, our study is the first study using a DAG and Blockchain
    to identify PSP. Complexity evaluation of an algorithm is essential for algorithm
    design [48]. Our computation analysis indicates that the computational time of
    the Blockchain transactions, and the number of sensors with high concentrations
    can be estimated. Moreover, the maximum transaction number, 2n, is not influenced
    by the upstream-downstream relationship once all sensors detect concentrations
    greater than the regulation standards. The computational time of DAG relies on
    the number of sensors and edges of irrigation networks. The least transaction
    number, n + 1, occurs once all pollution is detected by sensors along the same
    irrigation channel. The computational time of the DAG is essential for our proposed
    approach. Once the number of pollution types detected by stations increases the
    computational time will increase additionally. However, a DAG-based approach has
    been recently discussed as a way to revolutionize the blockchain technology [49,50].
    The advantage of our study is that a DAG was utilized to order the transaction
    and realize the computational time. 5. Conclusions Real-time identification of
    PSP is essential for ensuring irrigation water quality. While blockchain’s distributed
    ledger technology allows all users to record transactions in a decentralized data
    log built on a peer-to-peer internet, a WSN provides real-time remote monitoring
    data for high-quality production and processing systems with various sensors that
    are applicable in different fields of study. This study’s novel framework uses
    blockchain-based technology, a WSN in a DAG configuration, and GIS techniques
    to trace pollution pathways from irrigation water intake data. We then simulated
    irrigation water quality using a WASP model to successfully identify PSP for ten
    case studies. Since blockchain encrypts data and prevents data manipulation as
    water quality data are transferred among monitoring stations, the secured data
    used in this study can be useful for further real-world water quality management.
    Pollution sources and pathways of irrigation units can be targeted for further
    field investigation using the proposed blockchain traceability system with GIS
    tools. Once a monitored polluted irrigation unit is mapped with GIS following
    the blockchain tracing procedure, a WASP water quality simulation provides information
    for real-time identification of highly likely pollution sources that engage in
    illegal wastewater discharge. The computational complexity of the Blockchain transactions
    shows a linearly increasing relationship with the number of polluted stations.
    The proposed framework can be utilized in complex water quality monitoring networks
    with multiple pollution sources to identify PSP. The computational complexity
    of the transactions in the proposed framework should be evaluated. Supplementary

    IEEE Conference Location: Yogyakarta, Indonesia SECTION I. Introduction IoT is
    one of leading technology in industrial era 4.0 which has been implemented in
    various sectors for promoting industrial automation and intelligence such as agriculture,
    environment, health, housing, energy, business, etc. Besides that, agriculture
    has been contributed to an economy in every country [1]. So that, smart agriculture
    is popular nowadays. One of prior issues in agriculture is irrigation. Irrigation
    is process of watering crops with amount of water[2]. In smart agriculture, smart
    irrigation system is an essential solution to monitor the crops by using IoT sensor
    to capture several parameters. IoT is commonly used to transmit the sensing data
    which is then stored in the database. However, when multiple IoT devices track
    different parameters, the variation and the different data format cause the complexity
    increased. So, it can influence the data quality such as missing reading, inconsistency
    and accuracy, and ambiguity in large data [3]. In addition, those factors can
    influence the provenance and the integrity of data. Most existing research focused
    on implementing IoT to monitor any kind of agriculture processes remotely. It
    can maximize profit and reduce cost to manage several parameters in Irrigation
    such as temperature, humidity, etc. By using IoT, the collected data can be observed,
    analysed, and generalized for long time [4]. Many IoT platforms for precision
    agriculture especially in monitoring irrigation have been proposed for different
    kind of scenarios [5] [6]. However, smart irrigation needs lightweight, scalable,
    and security. Furthermore, by storing data from a large number of gadgets and
    enabling the creation of parties even without a governmental fog, blockchain networks
    can track, arrange, and bear out interactions [7]. To overcome these issues, blockchain
    as distributed ledger technology (DLT) present a new paradigm to eliminate any
    failure and increase data transparency and immutability. Blockchain has overcame
    problem in various sector, including health, finance, and energy [8]. The numerous
    agriculture applications connected with blockchain technological such as agri-food
    supply chain traceability [9], agricultural product tracking [10], smart greenhouse
    [11], etc. Furthermore, the use of Blockchain Technology in irrigation structures
    benefited society in a range of methods, including maintaining accountability
    of data and ensure transparency and data security or visibility. This paper proposes
    the implementation of blockchain in irrigation based IoT sensor data by using
    Ethereum to ensure irrigation data security. The rest of the paper organized as
    in Section 1 for introduction. Section 2 describes the related work and issues
    of IoT in agriculture. The architecture proposed is explained in Section 3. The
    experimental result is explained in Section 4, and the conclusion is described
    in Section 5. SECTION II. Related Work IoT has been widely used in various sector,
    including agriculture. In smart agriculture, IoT sensors as parameters are stored
    and processed to monitor soil quality, water management, crop growing condition,
    etc remotely. It can improve the efficiency by reducing time and cost. In smart
    agriculture, smart irrigation system is an essential solution to monitor the crops
    by using IoT sensor to capture several parameters. Several research have been
    conducted to answer issues in smart irrigation. Paper [12] proposed IOT to monitor
    and schedule irrigation through a web page. Furthermore, machine learning and
    IoT are used in Smart Irrigation to enhance farming process [13] [14]. Similarly,
    smart water management and weather condition become one of prior process in agriculture
    [15]–[17] which has been explained in detail. However, that research of agriculture,
    still have security issues like secure processing of the collected data. Besides
    that, Blockchain comes to solve most of the Internet of things challenges related
    to security and reliability. Blockchain technology is a decentralized/ distributed
    network where each is connected to others. A block consists of lots of valid transaction
    and its associated attributes. Blockchain technology has been used to solved challenges
    from different domains such as financial [18] [19], health [20], and energy [21]
    [22], to mention but a few. In the agriculture sector, Blockchain is being applied
    in various sector [23] such as supply chain management systems to provide transparency,
    security, neutrality, and reliability of all the operations in a supply chain
    [24] [25], smart greenhouse farm [16]. The irrigation data can easily be stored
    quickly by the IoT. In addition, this research proposes implementation of blockchain
    in irrigation based IoT sensor data by using Ethereum to ensure irrigation data
    security. SECTION III. Method A. Private Blockchain Network Blockchain is a distributed
    data storage which is a process of interaction between actors that can be used
    in data management in various fields. The blockchain network is divided into three,
    consisting of public, private, and permitted. Public blockchains allow anyone
    to access the blockchain network, private blockchain access is closed only to
    certain users, whereas permitted blockchains allow anyone to access it as long
    as they have permission to do so. in this study we use an Ethereum-based private
    blockchain using a consensus proof of authority. Figure 1. Proposed architecture
    illustration using blockchain ethereum Show All The architecture of our proposed
    research can be seen in Figure 1. There are four entity blocks in the architecture.
    The first is IoT Sensor, which is a node that sends sensor data to the blockchain
    network using the MQTT protocol. Ethereum based blockchain network where software
    can store IoT data sent to the Ethereum Blockchain network. The data repository
    stores all the results of the Ethereum Blockchain network process. then the last
    one is the user is the user who monitors. SECTION IV. Result and Discussion In
    this experiment, private blockchain network is constructed and tested in several
    scenarios. A. Private Blockchain Network Construction API collection is used to
    connect smart farm application and running system to monitor the data. The endpoint
    is stored several parameters in JSON format as shown in Table 1 Table 1. Parameter
    list of rest api MQTT endpoint is adjusted to the gateway which has been determined
    in Smart Farm gateway. This application subscribe data to the specific endpoint
    where the data format has been determined according to the parameter listed. To
    assure the system runs smoothly, web app is constructed to show data saved in
    blockchain as shown in Figure 2 Figure 2. Homepage to show blockchain data Show
    All In this experiment, private blockchain network is constructed based on Ethereum
    with consensus proof of authority by using four nodes namely: two authorized node
    for signer which have authority to write the transaction in block and two unauthorized
    node which does not have an authority as shown in Figure 3. Figure 3. Private
    blockchain network architecture Show All Figure 4. Four nodes of docker container
    Show All Figure 5. Four nodes of memory using Show All Figure 4 shows the implementation
    of four nodes in Docker Container. Besides, Figure 5 shows memory using of four
    nodes. B. Private Blockchain Network Testing There are three scenarios used in
    the experiment testing, namely: software unit testing, smart contract testing,
    and data integrity testing. a. Software Unit Testing Software unit testing monitors
    the performance of IoT and Blockchain reading and writing process. As shown in
    Table 2. There are four scenarios used to test the functional performance. Experimental
    result shows that four scenarios are successfully run. Table 2. Software unit
    testing scenarios b. Smart Contract Smart contract testing is used to prevent
    any fault after deploying process. In this experiment, assertion library chai
    is used. In addition, there are three scenarios used to test the performance.
    Experimental result shows that three scenarios are successfully run as shown in
    Table 3. Table 3. Smart contract testing scenarios c. Data Integrity Testing From
    the previous discussion, data integrity testing can be done by checking the hash
    chain from the block that stores transactions to the first block or whether the
    genesis block is connected. Furthermore, ten datasets are created using the generator
    program and stored the data then. For each block, network creates a new block
    with an interval of 15 seconds. Figure 6. Ten transaction is generated in fifteen
    seconds interval Show All Therefore, the data will be stored at 15 second intervals
    to ensure each data is stored in a different block. After storing the blocks,
    hash is going to be checked by looking the hash data in the block that stores
    transaction data. Furthermore, the application checks whether it can be verified
    that the block is connected to the first block or genesis block as shown in Figure
    7 Figure 7 Shows one of example of last blocks transaction. Show All There are
    10 transactions in block which is written from block 5 to block 16. Figure 8.
    Result data Show All Figure 8 shows result of private blockchain network. Table
    4. Comparison of hash and previous hash Table 4 shows that hash of each block
    is connected from block 0 to 14. So that, the implementation of blockchain as
    a media to store integrity of agriculture data based on IoT becomes one of solution
    which can be implemented. SECTION V. Conclusion This paper was taken up to build
    an integration of Block chain and IoT to ensure the integrity of Irrigation sensor
    data. Ethereum-based blockchain with using consensus proof-of-work as a blockchain
    network is used to ensure integrity data. Experimental result shows that the data
    integrity is safely stored in private blockchain network 100%. For the future
    work, the process can be integrated with machine learning to achieve better performance
    in managing irrigation data. ACKNOWLEDGMENT This research has been supported by

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Belagavi, India SECTION I. Introduction Contemporary
    farming practices exhibit increased efficiency in agricultural development compared
    to earlier periods. The early indications of significant transformations in daily
    life and agricultural supply chains are becoming evident, particularly in the
    networks for food, fiber, and bio-energy distribution. This article delves into
    the current state of industrial agriculture, drawing insights from patterns at
    the farm level, production techniques, and agri-food supply within the industrialized
    context. To realize Agriculture 4.0, we explore the integration of artificial
    intelligence, big data, and blockchain. Our proposed approach facilitates the
    continuous monitoring and management of agricultural operations via remote observation,
    underpinned by IoT, AI, and related technologies. The article hones in on key
    research challenges and applications of these emerging technologies in the agriculture
    sector, aimed at introducing novel research opportunities to industry professionals.
    Anticipating the development of foundational IoT and technological tools for agricultural
    production, we envision a future characterized by interconnected, dependable,
    and productive agriculture [1]. Traditionally, predicting crop yields was a task
    undertaken by farmers who relied on their personal experience and knowledge of
    the specific field and crop cultivation and disease identification [17], [18].
    Nevertheless, the challenge of accurately forecasting agricultural crop prices
    persists, necessitating a more data-driven approach. This challenge can be effectively
    addressed through the utilization of statistical data analysis, pattern tracking,
    visualization techniques, and other data mining methods facilitated by computer
    applications. This study presents a comprehensive model for forecasting crop prices
    by leveraging the past decade''s worth of data on agricultural field crop prices
    and incorporating detailed weather information, including rainfall data. The objective
    of this research paper is to develop a robust framework for predicting future
    crop prices that takes into account various interdependent factors. By harnessing
    a decade''s worth of historical data on agricultural field crop prices and coupling
    it with pertinent weather data, a structured approach to classifying crop prices
    emerges. In summary, this research endeavor aims to provide an innovative solution
    to the complex challenge of forecasting crop prices. Through a meticulous analysis
    of historical agricultural field crop prices and the incorporation of relevant
    weather data, this model endeavors to empower farmers with valuable insights into
    future crop pricing trends [2]. Fig. 1 Rapid growth of agriculture. Show All Agriculture
    involves the application of modern data analysis techniques to enhance decision-making
    and crop management practices. This approach leverages various advanced technologies,
    including automated steering systems, Geomapping, remote sensing, satellite positioning
    systems, and variable rate technology. The overarching goal of precision agriculture
    is to incorporate automation into the agricultural domain. However, it remains
    crucial for farmers to acquaint themselves with these technological advancements.
    Overcoming these obstacles can lead to streamlined agricultural processes and
    improved outcomes. The rapid advancement of computational methods has opened doors
    to the integration of data mining principles in agriculture. This research paper
    seeks to shed light on both the merits and demerits of precision agriculture,
    thereby offering insights to guide its effective implementation. By addressing
    the challenges and benefits, this study aims to facilitate the progress of agricultural
    practices in the right direction [3]. Agriculture''s significance as a crucial
    foundation in China is unwavering, and the constant progress in science and technology
    has consistently been accessible to all. Enhancing the scientific precision and
    convenience of farming for a broader community through intelligent technology,
    while concurrently tackling challenges and predicaments in agricultural practices,
    remains an enduring concern deserving thoughtful consideration and practical action.
    This study''s objective is to establish an innovative paradigm within the agricultural
    landscape. By harnessing the structural framework of this emerging agricultural
    knowledge base, the aim is to establish a standardized and systematic repository
    of knowledge. This encompassing repository includes an extraction corpus for agricultural
    planting data, intended to be a vital resource during data mining and model creation.
    The ultimate aspiration is to offer an effective and specialized solution in the
    form of an extensive big data corpus for crop planting. This resource is poised
    to serve as a proficient catalyst for applications involving agricultural knowledge
    graphs [4]. In agricultural fields, predominantly situated in desert areas, face
    significant climatic impacts on both crops and workers. These expansive fields
    often lie far from residential zones, posing challenges for effective monitoring
    and management. To address these issues, this study introduces an innovative smart
    irrigation system employing Zigbee technology for wireless monitoring and control.
    The system takes into account crucial parameters such as temperature, humidity,
    moisture, and gas concentration. Real-time assessment of farm conditions occurs,
    prompting automated adjustments to irrigation and cooling systems. The acquired
    data is communicated wirelessly to farmers. A unique aspect of this research involves
    modeling the system as an Agent-based framework, portraying the dynamic state
    of the agricultural field. Practical implementation and testing took place on
    a small-scale farm, effectively tracking farm status, depicting system behavior,
    and promptly responding to abnormal data. Notably, the results indicate that the
    system''s implementation enhances crop quality, leading to increased production
    levels [5]. Fig. 2 presents the existing agricultural technologies and the models.
    Fig. 2 Agricultural technologies and models. Show All The Indian agricultural
    sector has symbolized rural development movements such as the green, yellow, white,
    and blue revolutions. Serving as the driving force of the economy, a significant
    portion of the population is directly or indirectly engaged in farming. The overarching
    objective is to enhance both crop quality and quantity while optimizing labor
    input. The emergence of smart farming and the integration of the Internet of Things
    into agriculture are propelling a potential Third Green Revolution. Given the
    current circumstances, the adoption of smart agriculture has become an imperative.
    This research was conducted in the delta districts of Tamil Nadu, aiming to assess
    farmers'' characteristics and their knowledge regarding the adoption of smart
    agricultural practices. Furthermore, the study delved into identifying the significant
    challenges that farmers encounter when adopting smart agricultural techniques.
    Ultimately, the insights from this study can serve as valuable guidance for policymakers
    in comprehending farmers'' perceptions toward embracing smart agriculture. Enhancing
    the well-being of farmers not only benefits them individually but also contributes
    to the overall growth of the country [6]. SECTION II. Related Work With the continuous
    advancement of the Internet of Things, the realm of smart agriculture is undergoing
    a rapid evolution. Leveraging IoT-based solutions presents farmers with the opportunity
    to augment profits and decrease manual labor demands on their agricultural fields.
    Intelligent agricultural systems harness efficient, cost-effective sensors strategically
    positioned around crops and within fields, gathering real-time data on crop status
    and environmental factors. This data serves dual purposes: immediate decision-making
    and long-term planning for improved outcomes. However, there exist hurdles such
    as communication delays, bandwidth usage, sporadic internet connectivity in rural
    locales, and cost implications that warrant attention. This article delves into
    our ongoing endeavors concerning a three-tier smart agriculture system founded
    on LoRa technology: (i) Sensing, (ii) Fog, and (iii) Cloud layers. Our primary
    focus lies in harnessing LoRa''s characteristics of low-power consumption and
    extended range to convert traditional rural Indian farmlands into hubs of intelligent
    agriculture. This initiative holds the potential to revolutionize agriculture
    in rural settings, aligning with the broader global trend driven smart agriculture
    while being tailored to address the specific challenges faced by Indian farmers.
    [7]. This study takes a focused approach towards leveraging technology to forecast
    fertilizer requirements, thereby amplifying crop yields and financial gains. The
    task of fertilizer prediction, a cornerstone of agriculture, involves the intricate
    determination of the most suitable type and optimal amount of fertilizers for
    specific crops. Despite its pivotal role, this task presents formidable challenges,
    directly impacting both crop yields and the overarching goal of environmental
    sustainability. To transcend these challenges, the research harnesses the Random
    Forest machine learning technique, selected for its demonstrated superiority in
    accuracy when compared to methods like linear regression and K-Nearest Neighbours.
    By assimilating historical conditions and insights from farmers through Kaggle
    datasets, this study establishes a predictive framework capable of suggesting
    appropriate fertilizers based on a comprehensive analysis of environmental, soil,
    and plant-related factors. As a result, the research contributes significantly
    to the realm of fertilization strategy forecasting, tailored to the unique conditions
    encompassing each agricultural scenario. In the larger context, this undertaking
    exemplifies the marriage of traditional agricultural wisdom with cutting-edge
    technology, promising a future where precision agriculture thrives and yields
    are maximized in harmony with ecological sustainability [8]. This research delves
    into the realm of smart agriculture powered by Internet of Things technologies,
    which have significantly transformed conventional farming methods. The infusion
    of sensors and devices into the agricultural landscape has generated copious amounts
    of data, driving the need for effective data management and transfer due to challenges
    in data volume and storage. The study''s primary objective is to examine and contrast
    diverse data reduction methods aimed at optimizing IoT data transmission within
    smart agriculture. The evaluation of these techniques employs a specialized real-time
    dataset tailored for smart agricultural systems, encompassing five key features:
    ambient air temperature, ambient air moisture, soil temperature, soil moisture,
    and soil pH. The assessment of the techniques is based on three core metrics:
    information loss, computational cost, and energy consumption, while factoring
    in the size of each transmitted sample. The implementation of the three data reduction
    methods is realized using the Python programming language. The findings emphasize
    the existence of a delicate balance between information loss, computational expenditure,
    and energy usage, warranting meticulous consideration when selecting an appropriate
    data reduction technique for IoT nodes in the context of smart agriculture applications.
    This analysis furnishes valuable insights for informed decision-making that effectively
    balances these factors, duly accounting for distinct application prerequisites
    and constraints [9]. Precision agriculture deploys sensors to monitor vital environmental
    factors like temperature, humidity, and water levels. Despite infrequent update
    needs for these attributes, sensors continuously transmit data, causing significant
    redundancy. This inefficiency wastes network resources and unnecessary energy.
    To tackle this, the LEACH routing protocol is introduced as a self-regulating,
    energy-efficient solution. Optimizing data aggregation, it aims to improve network
    efficiency and energy conservation. LEACH organizes sensor nodes into clusters
    with designated cluster heads that collect and summarize data before transmitting
    it to a central base station. This approach drastically reduces redundant data
    transmission, aided by the dynamic selection of cluster heads, which balances
    energy distribution among nodes. Traditional data aggregation methods directly
    transmit raw data to a central base station, causing redundancy and energy drain.
    In contrast, LEACH''s emphasis on aggregating data at its source mitigates network
    congestion and wasteful energy use. The study evaluates LEACH''s effectiveness
    against conventional data aggregation through energy efficiency, network durability,
    and data accuracy metrics. Simulations and empirical analysis provide insights
    into the protocol''s benefits and limitations across diverse scenarios. Overall,
    the LEACH protocol offers a promising solution to the challenge of redundant data
    transmission, contributing to energy-efficient precision agriculture [10]. In
    the contemporary era, the proliferation of IoT devices and emerging technologies
    has led to an exponential surge in data creation. Novel strategies are emerging
    to effectively manage such extensive data volumes. Leveraging this data to make
    informed decisions in agriculture, in tandem with the integration of smart agricultural
    techniques, holds the potential to revolutionize traditional farming practices.
    The efficacy of smart agriculture hinges on the seamless synchronization of diverse
    devices, where pivotal tasks include data retrieval, storage, and analysis. Traditional
    approaches, however, grapple with challenges such as data security, privacy concerns,
    real-time decision-making, and the handling of semi-structured and unstructured
    data when confronted with substantial data generation. In the realm of smart agriculture,
    Probabilistic Data Structures have emerged as a potent and efficient solution
    for managing data and facilitating real-time responses. This study is dedicated
    to thoroughly analyzing the implementation of PDS applications within the domain
    of smart agriculture. Delving into the foundations, challenges, unexplored research
    avenues, and potential trajectories of smart agriculture, this paper aims to comprehensively
    elucidate the role of PDS. It caters to readers and researchers eager to broaden
    their understanding of this domain and seeks to identify uncharted research opportunities
    within this evolving field [11], [12]. With the global population on the rise,
    the demand for increased crop production is becoming more pressing. Despite current
    efforts where farmers cater to global food requirements, challenges like dwindling
    horticultural space, resource depletion, and a growing population underscore the
    necessity to enhance agricultural yields. This has sparked the emergence of smart
    farming, a term encompassing a range of innovations by startups, technology pioneers,
    and governments aimed at bolstering overall crop output. SF involves integrating
    data, communication technologies, hardware, and sensors into agricultural systems
    to yield more insightful information. Detecting plant diseases efficiently using
    advanced algorithms becomes a crucial task in this context. The research paper
    addresses three key dimensions: firstly, an effective approach for disease detection
    and cavity area identification through the Image Segmentation Algorithm; secondly,
    the application of diverse data analysis methods tailored for improved crop management,
    including the use of an optical transducer for detecting Nitrogen, Phosphorous,
    and Potash levels in soil, as well as soil moisture content assessment through
    sensors; and thirdly, the utilization of machine learning algorithms to predict
    fertilizer quantities based on soil sample features, thereby aiding farmers in
    accurate amount estimation [13], [19], [20]. Drones, also recognized as unmanned
    aerial vehicles , have predominantly been linked with military and industrial
    functions. Nevertheless, recent strides in sensor and information technology have
    broadened their applications, encompassing sectors like agriculture. With the
    world''s population set to reach 9 billion by 2055, addressing the surge in agricultural
    demand is imperative. While agriculture holds immense promise, it grapples with
    multifaceted challenges—labor scarcity, erratic weather, inadequate fertilization,
    and health risks from chemicals and pests. Leveraging advanced technologies, particularly
    drones, holds the potential to tackle these hurdles. Drones play pivotal roles
    in irrigation, crop supervision, soil analysis, field evaluation, and pest management.
    Their evolution incorporates open-source solutions, advanced sensors, extended
    flight durations, and versatility in tasks spanning crime prevention to disaster
    monitoring. This research seeks to underscore the pivotal role of drones in agriculture
    and assess the finest drones available for crop and field monitoring. The objective
    is to elevate crop quality, forestall field deterioration, and foster sustainable
    agricultural practices. [14] New Agricultural Financial Entities encounter obstacles
    in their advancement due to financial constraints stemming from information disparities
    among financiers, limited collateral choices, and internal limitations. To mitigate
    these challenges, a pioneering strategy is put forth in this study. It harnesses
    the tamper-resistant and decentralized attributes of Blockchain technology in
    combination with the robust capabilities of Big Data for data mining, analysis,
    and processing. This inventive framework seeks to institute a reliable mechanism
    aimed at effectively tackling the financial barriers. By leveraging Blockchain''s
    transparency and data integrity, and utilizing Big Data''s analytical power, this
    approach intends to foster a secure and credible environment for financing transactions.
    The proposed solution addresses the lack of information symmetry by ensuring transparency
    and immutability of financial records through Blockchain. This empowers financiers
    alike with accurate and accessible information, reducing risks and enhancing trust.
    Furthermore, the integration of Big Data technology enhances risk assessment,
    enabling more informed lending decisions while expanding collateral options through
    comprehensive data analysis. Through this novel framework, can potentially access
    the funding they require, overcoming their financial impediments. By establishing
    a secure and efficient financing ecosystem, this approach aims to not only boost
    the progress contribute to the broader growth of the agricultural sector. As a
    result, this study''s innovative fusion of Blockchain and Big Data technologies
    presents a promising avenue for transforming the landscape of agricultural finance
    [15], [16]. SECTION III. Research Gap A significant challenge in the field of
    agriculture is the lack of integration and interconnectedness among various domains
    within the sector. This lack of synergy between different aspects of agriculture
    poses several drawbacks and limitations. Additionally, the slow adoption of advanced
    algorithms and combinational methods further compounds these challenges. Figure
    3 presents however, the isolation of these domains can lead to fragmented information
    and siloed decision-making. Farmers and stakeholders may lack a comprehensive
    view of their operations, making it difficult to optimize resource allocation
    and respond effectively to changing conditions. Without effective integration
    of agricultural domains, potential synergies between different aspects of farming
    remain untapped. For instance, if weather forecasts could be combined with soil
    data and crop growth patterns, farmers could make more informed decisions on irrigation
    and planting schedules. The absence of such interconnectedness hampers the ability
    to leverage valuable insights and seize opportunities for improved efficiency
    and productivity. Fig. 3. Interconnection of domains and revealing significance.
    Show All The lack of integrated data and algorithms contributes to inefficient
    resource management. For instance, fertilizers and pesticides might be applied
    uniformly across a field, regardless of variations in soil conditions or pest
    prevalence. This leads to unnecessary expenses, environmental impact, and reduced
    profitability. Sustainable agriculture requires careful consideration of environmental
    factors, resource use, and economic viability. Integrating algorithms and combinational
    methods could help identify optimal approaches for minimizing environmental impact
    while maintaining profitability. The absence of such integration could hinder
    the adoption of sustainable practices. Addressing these drawbacks necessitates
    a concerted effort to bridge the gaps between different agricultural domains and
    to accelerate the adoption of advanced algorithms and methods. Collaboration among
    researchers, technologists, policymakers, and farmers is essential to develop
    holistic solutions that optimize agricultural operations and contribute to a more
    resilient and sustainable future. SECTION IV. Proposed system Table 1 presents
    the gradations of disputes by incorporating Edge Computing into the IOT framework
    for climate determination in agriculture, we can leverage its advantages of real-time
    analysis, reduced data transmission, immediate responses, enhanced data privacy,
    scalability, and efficient handling of data volume. This innovative approach empowers
    farmers with actionable insights, enabling them to make informed decisions promptly
    and effectively manage climate conditions for optimal agricultural outcomes. Edge
    Computing is a paradigm that involves processing data closer to the data source,
    at the ''edge'' of the network, rather than sending all data to a centralized
    cloud server for analysis. In the context of agriculture and climate determination,
    this means that IOT devices equipped with sensors can process and analyse data
    locally, on-site, without the need to transmit all data to a distant cloud server.
    This reduces latency and enables faster decision-making. Table 2 presents the
    summary of various techniques especially Big Data analytics empowers stakeholders
    to make data-driven decisions by providing actionable insights based on comprehensive
    analyses. This can result in more informed market strategies and risk management.
    Probabilistic Data Structures might not offer the same level of data-driven decision
    support due to their limitations in handling complex, multidimensional data. In
    conclusion, while Probabilistic Data Structures have their place in specific data
    manipulation tasks, the intricate and multifaceted nature of Global Trade and
    Market Dynamics in agriculture benefits significantly from the capabilities of
    Big Data analytics. With its ability to handle comprehensive datasets, identify
    patterns, provide real-time insights, scale to accommodate growth, offer contextual
    understanding, and drive data-driven decisions, Big Data analytics stands as the
    preferred choice for efficiently determining global trade and market dynamics
    in agriculture. TABLE I. Comparison of several methods As compared with time taken

    CONCLUSION & FUTURE SCOPE In conclusion IoT-driven smart agriculture is revolutionizing
    the farming landscape, bolstering productivity and minimizing labor through the
    power of data-driven solutions. The seamless integration of real-time data capture
    and strategic sensor deployment empowers agile decision-making and strategic long-range
    planning. However, it''s important to confront hurdles like communication bottlenecks,
    financial implications, and connectivity challenges head-on. The convergence of
    machine learning with agriculture, as evidenced by techniques such as Random Forest,
    holds the potential to revolutionize crop yields through precise fertilizer predictions.
    This is particularly pivotal in meeting the global demand for sustenance. The
    strategic adoption of LoRa technology within the realm of intelligent agriculture
    opens doors to innovative breakthroughs, especially within rural Indian settings,
    presenting transformative solutions to age-old agricultural obstacles. Drones
    stand as indispensable tools, playing a pivotal role in overseeing crops, alleviating
    labor scarcities, and mitigating pest-related concerns. By incorporating Probabilistic
    Data Structures, the management of the copious data generated by IoT devices in
    agriculture gains efficiency and effectiveness. Moreover, the fusion of Blockchain
    and Big Data technologies has the capacity to overhaul agricultural financing,
    instilling transparency and fostering exponential growth. This amalgamation of
    technological prowess and agricultural acumen propels efficiency, sustainability,
    and advancement within the realm of farming, ushering in an era of unprecedented
    progress implementing the real time. Authors Figures References Keywords Metrics

    Water is becoming increasingly scarce [1, 2], and unfortunately few people are
    aware of this. According to a report released by the United Nations Children’s
    Fund (UNICEF) in 2021, more than 36 countries are currently experiencing water
    supply problems. Again, according to the UN, the demand for water will increase
    by 50% by 2030 [3], due to the growing needs of industry, agriculture, electricity,
    population growth and especially with the Russian-Ukrainian war. It is in this
    context that our research takes place. In effect, we are interested in smart agriculture
    as an alternative ensuring the water consumption reduction. Farmers used to put
    a lot of emphasis on evaluating soil composition and coming up with novel ways
    to boost crop yields [16]. Farmers aren’t always aware of the water content of
    their fields, the amount of water they need to irrigate them, or the present climatic
    conditions that impact them. In this way, the traditional research on soil moisture
    content is no longer sufficient to boost agricultural yields due to the major
    changes in climate. This is because soil moisture, temperature, and humidity levels
    fluctuate during the day in different places of the planet. Drip farming, sprinkler
    farming and other conventional technologies are examples of traditional methods
    that are manually managed and time consuming. When adopting automated irrigation
    [17], other agricultural operations may be completed at the same time, saving
    time and money. Watering needs change throughout the day, requiring a method that
    acts in real time to take these changes into consideration for irrigation. Because
    of recent developments in sensors for agricultural irrigation systems, as well
    as the evolution of Machine Learning (ML) that can be used in the development
    of these systems [18]. Our proposition IrrigControl aims to improve water resource
    management by offering a smart system that decides on the irrigation process using
    trustworthy devices. Small and medium agricultural producers will be able to monitor
    and gather data on climatic and soil variables, store it, process it using fuzzy
    tools, techniques, and algorithms, and finally manage it over the Internet thanks
    to its three-level architecture. The proposed smart farm system’s privacy will
    be protected using Blockchain technology. The farmer will be able to see data
    in tables and statistical graphs through the IrrigControl system’s interface.
    It will also send out email and notifications about a specific event. Mamdani’s
    fuzzy logic method, designed through the rule base and the modelling of input
    and output variables, allows irrigation decision making. Sensors implemented in
    the field ensure the collection of real-time data. Several users can be connected
    at the same time to control the climate parameters. Each transmission of climate
    parameter value is considered as a transaction between the server and other IoT
    devices. Blockchain is used in its Ethereum version to secure all these transactions.
    The effectiveness of our approach is evaluated not only through the irrigation
    precision in real time but also through privacy preservation and security. The
    main contributions of this work are focused on the following topics. Increase
    irrigation precision and reduce costs: collect environmental data received from
    sensors in real time, using not only temperature but also climatic factors for
    irrigation planning. Based on trusted devices, use the valuable data collected
    to be more efficient while considering the security and privacy preservation aspect.
    Manage Irrigation Events: automated farm events with personalized notifications.
    It is possible to get critical alerts on operational problems as they occur and,
    at the same time, create personalized events. Get insightful data analytics: Analyse
    data with personalized and dynamic graphical reports. The remainder of the paper
    is laid out as follows. The background of the study is found in Sect. 2. In the
    third section, similar research projects will be presented. The proposed smart
    System IoT platform is described in Sect. 4. The experimental results are discussed
    in Sect. 5. Section 6 concludes the paper with a discussion as well as conclusions
    and recommendations for further research. 2 Background Study 2.1 Internet of Things
    Smart agriculture uses the Internet of Things to reduce usages such as duration,
    manpower, and resources. Sensors can talk with one another and transfer signals
    using a web connection. This smart irrigation system is built to monitor production
    using sensors such as humidity sensors, and temperature sensors [7, 8]. 2.2 Fuzzy
    Learning Fuzzy logic is one of the unsupervised techniques of machine learning
    and has emerged alongside big data technologies [13]. The fuzzifier transforms
    input data into linguistic values of fuzzy sets, while the rule base is made up
    of a set of rules that express the expert knowledge control policy as “IF - THEN”
    statements [5, 14] as shown in Fig. 1. In order to determine a fuzzy control action,
    the inference engine must compare the output of the fuzzifier with the fuzzy logic
    rules and conduct fuzzy implication and approximation reasoning. In order to produce
    a nonfuzzy (crisp) control action from an inferred fuzzy control action, the defuzzifier
    completes the operation of defuzzification using preset output membership functions.
    The definitions and ideas of a fuzzy logic controller are described in further
    depth in [5]. Fig. 1. Architecture of a fuzzy logic system [6]. Full size image
    2.3 Blockchain The word “Blockchain” means a chain of interconnected blocks and
    permits the storing of data while generating and updating the distributed ledger
    using consensus procedures, as well as encrypting the data during transmission
    [12]. The meaning of the word “blockchain” is obvious [15]. [5] describes Blockchain
    as a distributed database without a centralized management system. In its peer-to-peer
    network, it controls how its members communicate. Transfer of data cannot be irreversible.
    A node, a computational device, requests a transaction and the other nodes in
    the network receive this via broadcast. A validation algorithm is used to validate
    the transaction before it joins the network. The previously completed transaction
    is updated with the validated transaction(s) They unite to make a block, which
    is then merged into the larger chain. The new block is added to the current Blockchain
    using a consensus mechanism [5]. 3 Related Works To achieve the principles of
    sustainable agriculture, technology, research, and development must be exploited
    to the utmost extent possible. There were three key revolutions in agricultural
    development two years ago, notably machine learning, the internet of things and
    Blockchain according to the artificial intelligence research tool Semantic Scholar.
    The number of published papers presenting irrigation systems during the last two
    years is indicated in the figure below Fig 3. Only 10% of the research has been
    focused on water management, whereas over 61% has been focused on crop management.
    Furthermore, crop management relies heavily on water management, including water
    quality and irrigation [1]. The total number of publications with keywords: “smart
    irrigation” and “IoT” since 2020 is about 346 papers. But as soon as we add the
    keyword “Blockchain” or “security”, in our search, the number is reduced to 11
    i.e., by 97% including 80% of papers submitted in conference. Among 11 papers
    selected, we have chosen the 5 most cited papers to summarise the applied methods,
    the contributions and the limitations. Table 1. Research findings and shortcomings
    of smart agriculture systems Full size table Fig. 2. Number of published papers
    presenting machine learning, IoT and Blockchain systems for smart irrigation.
    Full size image The main challenges faced by automated irrigation systems, as
    shown in the Table 1 above; are mainly summarized in the following points: Limited
    use of knowledge-based ML techniques Filtering of some important agricultural
    parameters Testing of systems only for a few plants Need for expert knowledge
    for manual irrigation Providing medium- and large-scale farmers with precision
    irrigation monitoring and control systems. Many networks security and communication
    performance issues exist in precision agriculture networks, making it difficult
    to build secure IoT networks. Farmers, for example, need to defend their smart
    greenhouse networks from cyber threats by securing supply chain systems for the
    exchange of their crops. They also need a secure environment in which they can
    manage and access their IoT agricultural machines without risking their identity,
    privacy, or the integrity of the data processed by these units. Precision agriculture
    network systems, on the other hand, present network performance issues such as
    communication speed with many heterogeneous devices and sensors, device power
    consumption, bandwidth and latency, and data storage limitations. Therefore, Blockchain
    technology can improve the security, transparency and tamper-resistance of IoT
    communications. In addition, real-time data tracking in faster end-to-end transaction
    processes would boost digital agricultural processes. Therefore, Blockchain technology
    can provide good solutions for security and performance of IoT networks in precision
    agriculture systems. 4 The Proposed Approach This study is conducted to solve
    the irrigation precision and security issues as it was mentioned in previous sections.
    The research solution concept is described as follows: The Fuzzy Learning (FL)
    can be adopted to address the prediction of the valve position. It allows processing
    collected sensors’ data. Such approach guarantees Increasing irrigation precision
    and reduce costs. To ensure data integrity, the Blockchain technology seems to
    be an efficient solution. Its ability to ensure immutable transfer data transactions
    provides a stable environment to safeguard data integrity against manipulative
    attacks. Fig. 3. Block diagram of irrig control. Full size image As shown in the
    diagram, our proposal is built around 4 layers. The first sensor layer is composed
    of the following sensors: The installed sensors’ specs are listed below: Esp32
    DHT11 sensor Humidity sensor Fig. 4. The component of the sensor layer Full size
    image A wireless sensor network of sensor nodes is established for data collection.
    The ESP32 receives the output from these sensors. A Python program is used to
    collect data from sensors on an hourly basis, store it in an SQLite database,
    and transfer it to the server over a web service. The built web service reads
    the projected data and saves it to the server’s MySQL database, which is used
    in the fuzzy prediction method. The study employs Blockchain technology to manage
    the data storage than a centralized server. A smart contract (SC) is used to implement
    the backup procedure. The SC gathers the climatic parameters from the related
    distributed ledgers. The prediction is made using a fuzzy logic inference system.
    This operation requires a large database for learning, something impossible to
    do by saving only half season data corresponding to the duration of our study.
    For this reason, we have resorted to an external database available since 2019:
    http://www.emy.gr/emy/en/climatology/climatology-city The membership functions
    associated to the inputs and outputs are as shown in the Table 2. By combining
    several values of temperature and humidity, we obtain different levels of electric
    valve opening. Example: for a temperature of 25\\(^\\circ \\) and 69% humidity,
    we have an electric valve opening of 58.3%. The result can be displayed in the
    form of the following graph 5: Fig. 5. Window for fuzzy rule viewer: variation
    of valve position (output) depending on the variation of temperature and humidity
    (inputs). Full size image Fig. 6. Water consumption for the time period of 48
    h. Full size image Table 2. The membership functions associated to input and output
    variables Full size table 5 Discussion The major goal of this research is to create
    a smart trusted system including the processing of various climatic information,
    the display, actuator control, and wireless connectivity. Our system’s operation
    is straight-forward; it consists of a settings or control component and a measuring
    component. The system is set to run on autopilot. When the ground is dry, the
    system is activated automatically by the ESP32 sending a signal to the pump in
    response to an alert from the humidity and temperature sensors. The planning of
    this observation framework was made to allow the monitoring of crop parameters
    during field deployment at different locations on the farm. The designed application
    allows storing and retrieving data at any time from any remote location. Its objective
    was to analyse relevant information in real time on weather parameters while helping
    to organize daily irrigation tasks. In addition, data collected through sensors
    are integrated in the Blockchain to provide security so that no one will be able
    to change the values that influence the decision of the valve position. The automatism
    is translated by the recovery of the climatic values of the sensors and to actuate
    the output of the valve. Intelligence manifests itself in the analysis of the
    different parameters and the decision for the output by fuzzy logic. Because of
    its dual significance, fuzzy logic is used in this module. The proposed design
    was shown to effectively control and monitor agricultural conditions while minimizing
    water waste in empirical tests. As a result, establishing an automatic-sensor-enabled
    architecture system could be a viable approach for reducing water consumption.
    As we can see (Fig. 6) after 48 h of testing the reduction in water consumption
    between manual irrigation and irrigation following our proposal is considerable.
    6 Conclusion This paper provides a convenient interface for the development of
    a smart irrigation monitoring and control system based on the Internet of Things.
    A fully functional system was created and implemented. The main objective of this
    work was to enable farmers to analyse relevant real-time insights to meteorological
    parameters while helping organize everyday irrigation tasks and benchmark results.
    Our system is based on secured wired communication. In addition, wireless communication
    allows farmers to view the results and control certain parameters without having
    to move. Experiments have shown that with the suggested smart irrigation system,
    we can get good outcomes such as cheap manual labour costs and efficient water
    utilization for irrigation. We see several perspectives for the work presented.
    One direction of research would consist of testing the system in another area
    such as intelligent transport and Integration of all functionalities and migration
    to an Irrig Control platform. References Singh, D.K., Sobti, R., Kumar Malik,

    Keywords: horticulture; micronutrient; Industry 4.0; SDGs; IoT; blockchain; real-time
    prediction; AR; bigdata 1. Introduction According to the Food and Agriculture
    Organization and World Health Organization State of Food Security and Nutrition
    in the World (SOFI) report,45 million children die from the deadliest form of
    malnutrition under the age of five [1]. A chronic deficiency of essential nutrients
    in their nutrition has also resulted in delayed development and growth in two
    billion children under the age of five. This indicates that there is a need to
    have more emphasis on overcoming food insecurity and malnutrition due to climate
    extremes and economic disruption. Even the SDGs (SDG 2 and SDG 12) of the UN emphasize
    eradicating hunger and enhancing food security with responsible consumption and
    production toward sustainability [2,3]. Healthy micronutrients for overcoming
    malnutrition can be achieved with sustainable farming of fruits and vegetables,
    i.e., horticulture [4]. India is currently the world’s second-largest producer
    of fruits and vegetables, trailing only China. Horticulture comprises fruits,
    root and tuber crops, mushrooms, vegetables, spices, aromatic plants, flowers,
    bamboo, coconut, cashew, and cocoa. Different strategies such as technology promotion,
    research, post-harvest management, and marketing are key for the growth of horticulture.
    Improving horticulture production, increasing farmer income, improving nutritional
    security, and improving productivity by using quality germplasm, planting material,
    and micro irrigation to save water are the key vision of India for the promotion
    of holistic horticulture growth. Horticulture crops significantly contribute to
    the Indian economy by enhancing farm output, generating employment, and providing
    raw materials to various food-processing businesses [5]. The amount of land allotted
    for horticulture is minimal, but the demand for the production of horticulture
    is high. Therefore, meeting the demand with minimum resources is a bit challenging,
    as sustainable practices need to be adopted to meet a sustainable environment
    [6]. It has also been observed that the export rate of Asian countries such as
    India has increased in the past few years; however, there are a few challenges
    such as meeting quality standards set by international countries and payment for
    exports. The main challenge in fruits and vegetables is the short lifetime after
    plucking. Additionally, given that the majority of horticulture cultivation is
    processed in rural areas, it has been determined that horticulture has to be promoted
    in urban areas. 1.1. Problem Statement Ref. [7] discussed the main problems that
    are present in horticulture, including the decline of fertile soil, global warming,
    rising land prices, shortage of water, and lost opportunity of low-cost labor,
    all of which portray serious threats to growth of horticulture. For horticultural
    crops, abiotic stresses like an inundation, temperature extremes, salinity, pH,
    and drought are major obstacles. As an outcome of global warming, there will be
    less precipitation all in all, and the snow cover will melt faster, resulting
    in extreme drought. These circumstances lead to several stress-related problems,
    including the deficit of fertile soil, flooding, increased evapotranspiration,
    low soil-oxygen levels, decreased production, leachate of nutrients, and slow
    planting. Alongside increasing temperatures, global warming had also contributed
    to record-breaking cold weather. Land salinity and irrigation-water salinity are
    also significant concerns for horticultural production. Along with these problems,
    previous studies also discussed that sustainable pest-management methods need
    to be adopted to protect against pathogens and pest resistance. The absence of
    markets to accumulate production, the substantial percentage of middlemen, the
    absence of marketing institutions safeguarding farmers’ interests, the imperfect
    pricing system, and the absence of transparency in market-information systems,
    especially in the export market, is the main marketing problems for horticultural
    produce. 1.2. Motivation, Novelty, and Contribution of the Study As discussed
    above, the traditional approaches lack appropriate monitoring of pest control,
    water management, soil management, light control, and temperature control, as
    these parameters are crucial for the effective production of horticulture with
    a sustainability aspect. The previous study found that the different issues in
    this group highlight the necessity for more environmentally sound processes, in
    addition to a rise in the utilization of automated systems and accurate processes.
    Industry 4.0 technology has proven its capability in various applications through
    the fusion of advanced technologies such as the Internet of Things, artificial
    intelligence, blockchain, robotics, digital twins, and big data. The amalgamation
    of Industry 4.0 and horticulture provides the opportunity to transform industrial
    agriculture into the next generation, namely Horticulture 4.0. Moreover, Industry
    4.0 is capable of achieving sustainable and intelligent ecosystem with real-time
    management of farming, automation, intelligent decisions, real-time processing,
    and analysis [8]. It has proved that Industry 4.0 technologies have already delivered
    exceptional results in greenhouse farming for a sustainable food supply chain
    with the integration of hardware and software algorithms and giving rise to higher
    yields using fewer resources and less water. Although many studies have addressed
    Industry 4.0 technologies individually for fruits and vegetables, they are limited
    studies that merely address multiple Industry 4.0 digital technologies as single
    concepts for discussing their significance in horticulture. Based on the aforementioned
    information, this study analyzed the value and applications of Industry 4.0 technologies
    in horticulture for real-time monitoring of fruit-and-vegetable conditions in
    various environmental settings, intelligent and predictive analytics for fruit-and-vegetable
    growth and disease estimation, and virtual horticulture plants. The contribution
    of the study is as follows: The significance of using Industry 4.0 technologies
    for horticulture is discussed in the study for sustainability. We also discuss
    the significance and applications of the Internet of Things, cloud computing,
    artificial intelligence, blockchain, and big data for horticulture for enhancing
    traditional practices for disease detection, irrigation management, fertilizer
    management, maturity identification, marketing, and the supply chain, soil fertility,
    and weather patterns at pre-harvest, harvest, and post-harvest Finally, the article
    discusses the challenges and suggests recommendations for the wide adoption of
    any future enhancement in the vicinity of horticulture. In horticulture settings,
    robotics, drones with vision technology and AI for the detection of pests, weeds,
    plant diseases, and malnutrition, and edge-computing portable devices that can
    be developed with IoT and AI for predicting and estimating the disease of crops
    are vital recommendations suggested in the study. 1.3. Methodology of the Study
    In this section, the methodology of the study is presented. Based on the limitations
    identified in previous studies, this study framed a research question that was
    employed to carry out the review. The research question was, “What is the progress
    and significance of Industry 4.0 technology integration in horticulture?” This
    research question constructed various keywords with Boolean function operators
    in the Scopus and Web of Science databases. The following strings were considered
    for obtaining publications: “horticulture AND Industry 4.0”, “horticulture AND
    sustainability”, “Industry 4.0 for fruits and vegetables”, “Industry 4.0 AND digitalization”,
    “horticulture AND digitalization”, “horticulture AND IoT”, “IoT AND fruits and
    vegetables”, “disease detection AND horticulture crop”, “blockchain AND horticulture”,
    “artificial intelligence AND horticulture”, “quality assessment AND artificial
    intelligence”, “big data AND horticulture”, “blockchain AND marketing of fruits
    and vegetables”, “blockchain AND energy”, “crop monitoring AND horticulture”,
    and “soil fertility AND horticulture.” During the search for articles, there was
    al ack of articles that merely emphasized the integration of Industry 4.0 for
    horticulture. Therefore, we considered a few conference articles and other supportive
    articles in this study. Based on the obtained articles, the study categorized
    four different sub-sections in which the progress and significance of the previous
    studies that implemented Industry 4.0 for enhancing horticulture from production
    to marketing are assessed. After analyzing the studies, few limitations were identified
    and vital recommendations for future work were suggested. 1.4. Comparative Analysis
    Table 1 provides a comparative analysis of the different studies that focused
    on horticulture that are analyzed within the proposed study. In most previous
    studies, it was identified that the study only focused on some key areas in horticulture,
    like yield monitoring, pesticide monitoring, and quality assessment. A recent
    study emphasized the different issues in horticulture from the perspective of
    industries. Along with this, [9] reviewed the different critical parameters that
    are required for automation with IoT for vertical gardens. Ref. [10] carried out
    a review on the significance of deep-learning models in horticulture for various
    applications. Ref. [11] discussed the implementation of digital twins in horticulture.
    However, there is a possibility of emphasizing the importance of multiple Industry
    4.0 technologies for addressing the different issues of horticulture from production
    to marketing. The current study focused on discussing the different Industry 4.0
    technologies for overcoming the different issues of horticulture within the context
    of sustainability. This study highlights the significance and application of Industry
    4.0 for horticulture. Based on the limitations identified, this study also discusses
    vital recommendations for future work. Table 1. Comparative analysis of the previous
    studies with the current study. The following describes how the study is structured:
    Section 2 discusses an overview of Horticulture 4.0 and Industry 4.0 technologies,
    Section 3 addresses the intervention of Industry 4.0 technologies in horticulture,
    and Section 4 covers the discussion and recommendations. 2. Overview of Horticulture
    and Industry 4.0 High temperatures have two main effects on crop production: they
    inhibit vegetative growth and have a detrimental effect on fruit production. Prolonged
    transpiration along with subjection to extreme temperatures limits vegetable crops
    that are susceptible to considerable transpiration deficits [16,17]. Another problem
    is that the maximum time for the fruit set is proportional to humidity levels.
    Extremely high temperatures can occur. The obvious limitation encountered by cold
    temperatures is the freezing of plant tissues. Rapidly pushing freezing temperatures
    at a phase of rapid growth might cause damage to a variety of plant tissues [18,19].
    Some plants can adapt to cold temperatures provided there is sufficient time and
    the appropriate circumstances, whereas others cannot. Changes in regional precipitation
    patterns may cause an increase in drought conditions in many different parts of
    the world as atmospheric CO2 levels to rise [20]. Although the current belief
    is that leaf photosynthetic responds to high CO2 as well as soil-water deficiency,
    the connections between CO2 enrichment and drought stress remain unexplored [21].
    These are the few problems that have been addressed by previous studies in the
    area of horticulture. Below, we discuss the significance of Industry 4.0 technologies
    and their importance in enhancing practices in horticulture. Industry 4.0, often
    known as the Fourth Industrial Revolution, is the phenomenon that results from
    the impact of the IoT on information and communication technology. With the help
    of technologies like the integration of cyber-physical systems (CPS), IoT, and
    the real-time interaction between machinery, software, and people, it aims to
    revolutionize the industry through smart factories that will enable greater flexibility
    in production needs, efficient resource allocation, and process integration from
    device monitoring to final delivery [22]. Figure 1 depicts the technologies that
    can be intervened in horticulture, such as artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain,
    big data, the Internet of things (IoT), and cloud computing, in industry 4.0.
    Figure 1 illustrates the implementation and application area in which Industry
    4.0 can be adopted for horticulture. In horticulture, there are different stages,
    including pre-harvesting, harvest, and post-harvest. Industry 4.0 technologies
    cover the following parameters for horticulture: automation of actuators, disease
    detection, irrigation management, fertilizer management, maturity identification,
    marketing and supply chain, soil fertility, and weather patterns. Along with these
    applications, Industry 4.0 integration in horticulture enables quality assessment
    and grading of horticulture products. The quality assessment of horticulture products
    is different in the three stages. The following are aspects through which the
    quality and grading of a horticulture product are decided, and they are typical
    cultivar ripeness, absence of defects and blemishes, a non-harmful number of pesticide
    residues, freshness, and other chemicals. Therefore, the quality assessment and
    grading of horticulture products mainly rely on the parameters discussed above.
    The monitoring of each parameter and utilizing the data generated from different
    wireless sources with Industry 4.0 technologies boost the performance of the horticulture
    industry for the future. Figure 1. Horticulture 4.0. Overview of Technologies
    and TheirFunctions IoT is the primary technology that enables the provision of
    real-time information that is required for other technologies to implement their
    functions. IoT is an open network of intelligent devices that may self-organize;
    exchange information, data, and resources; and respond and act according to circumstances
    and environmental changes [22]. Fundamentally, IoT comprises the following layers
    in its architecture: perception layer, access layer, network layer, middleware
    layer, and application layer [23]. The perception layer is a key layer in which
    sensors, actuators, and identification technologies empower the transmission of
    real-time information and also enable control of things from remote locations
    through internet connectivity. The network layer empowers the transmission of
    packets of data with the assistance of communication protocols that are embedded
    in the architecture. Wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi), Bluetooth, and Zigbee are widely
    used communication protocols to establish a wireless sensor network and connect
    it with the internet to form the IoT [24]. The limitations of these communication
    protocols are the short transmission range and high-power consumption. In view
    of the IoT, most IoT devices are resource-constrained (work on battery power),
    so it demands communication protocols that consume less energy and transmit to
    a long range. A low-power–wide-area network (LPWAN) enables these challenges to
    be overcome, as it meets the requirements of the IoT [25]. Long-range (LoRa),
    Sigfox, and narrowband (NB-IoT) are LPWAN communication technologies. As part
    of the application layer, a cloud server is suitable for visualization, real-time
    monitoring, and applying further analytics on the data available in it.AI is the
    science of enabling computers to accomplish intelligent tasks that could only
    be completed by humans. AI is a multidisciplinary technology capable of combining
    machine learning, cognition, human-computer interaction, emotion recognition,
    data storage, and decision-making [26]. The bottleneck of AI was overcome with
    the advancement of processing power, and the development of deep learning and
    enhanced learning based on huge data progressed. With the constant advancement
    of GPUs has come the successful development of customized processors and increased
    computer capacity; this has established the groundwork for AI’s rapid progress.
    Artificial neural networks (ANNs), decision-support systems (DSSs), genetic algorithms
    (Gas), support-vector machines, and computer vision are some of the AI techniques
    that are widely applied in the field of agriculture for the management of soil,
    crops, disease, and weeds [27]. Big data is defined as data sets that are too
    massive or complicated to be acquired, maintained, and processed in a low-latency
    manner by conventional database systems [28]. Big data has characteristics such
    as high volume, high velocity, and high variety. Big-data analytics can ultimately
    enable better and faster decision-making, model, and forecast future outcomes,
    and improve business intelligence [29]. A distributed, unchangeable database called
    blockchain makes it simpler to track assets and record transactions in a corporate
    network [30]. Distributed ledger technology, immutable records, and smart contracts
    are the key elements of blockchain. Each transaction is logged as a “block” of
    data as it occurs. Each block is linked to the ones that come before and after
    it. Transactions are linked in an irreversible chain Horticulture is utilizing
    the IoT to collect data from field planting and horticultural facilities for production,
    management, and service. Robots, drones, remote sensors, and computer imagery
    are used in horticulture as part of the IoT to monitor crops, survey, and map
    fields, as well as to provide data to farmers for logical farm-management strategies
    that will reduce both time and cost [31]. AI is facilitating various sectors in
    agriculture to enhance productiveness and performance and to overcome traditionally
    demanding situations in each field. The intervention of AI in horticulture is
    helping farmers to improve their farming efficiency and reduce hostile environmental
    impacts [32]. Blockchain horticulture empowers information to be traced throughout
    the food supply chain to improve food safety. The ability of blockchain to store
    and manage data creates traceability, which is utilized to enhance the creation
    and deployment of innovations for intelligent farming and index-based horticultural
    insurance. Improved quality control and food safety are advantages of applying
    blockchain to gardening. Increased supply-chain traceability of farmers’ productivity
    will lead to more equitable payments for farmers [33]. Farmers can learn in-depth
    information about topics like rainfall patterns, water cycles, fertilizer requirements,
    and more thanks to large datasets. Companies can utilize this information to choose
    which crops to produce and when to harvest them in order to maximize their profits
    [34]. Data on horticulture are gathered, examined, and stored using cloud computing.
    Farmers can better understand crop conditions by using cloud-connected wireless
    sensors to collect data from the field and machine-learning algorithms to analyze
    that real-time information [35]. Precision horticultural farming heavily relies
    on augmented reality. Farmers can use augmented reality in horticulture to boost
    production, reduce crop waste, and teach other farmers [36]. 3. Intervention of
    Industry 4.0 in Horticulture In this section, we discuss the various Industry
    4.0 technologies in horticulture intending to transform into Horticulture 4.0.
    3.1. IoT Intervention in Horticulture The potential of pests and plant diseases
    is inseparably associated in particular withspecific weather characteristics.
    Previous research concluded that humidity and rainfall have a significant impact
    on pathogen spread and propagation [37]. Pests and diseases are more inclined
    to spread as a result of the wind. According to the information presented above,
    pests and diseases are prevalent in crops, and monitoring of the related parameters
    can be achieved with the IoT. An intelligent monitoring system was proposed on
    the basis of the IoT with a global packet for radio service (GPRS) and Zigbee
    communication protocol for pest warning, planting works, and production-quality
    checks of apples with the assistance of soil sensors, meteorological sensors,
    and cameras [38]. The feasibility, yield, and irrigation water-use efficiency
    of an IoT-based precision-irrigation system with LoRaWAN technology on fresh-market
    tomato production was analyzed [39]. ET, Watermark 200SS-5 soil-metric potential
    sensors, MP40, and a decision-support system were used to design and test four
    irrigation-scheduling treatments. A study was conducted with the integration of
    a camera module, and the images collected were used to analyze the water-management
    system as well as detect plant disease within a green environment [40]. Researchers
    established a technology platform using the IoT for environmental data acquisition,
    disaster warning, transmission, remote control, and an information push in vegetable
    greenhouses in real-time and lessen the influence of climate catastrophes on vegetable
    development [41]. The data collected by an IoT board are expected to be utilized
    to train machine-learning models for the development of intelligent automated
    indoor microclimate horticulture crops [42]. A database contains the results of
    the sensor analysis and it is also linked with data from the Indonesian Weather
    Agency, which contains daily meteorological data from the cultivation location
    [43]. To ensure the proper operation of the greenhouse automation system, multiple
    measuring stations are needed in a modern greenhouse to identify the local climate
    parameters in various areas of a large-scale greenhouse [44]. The IoT paradigm
    is allowing the scientific community to establish integrated settings where data
    could be automatically transferred among many distinctive networks to provide
    consumers with specific relevant information [45]. The security of the foods supplied
    can be ensured by utilizing the provenance data that are kept throughout the supply
    chain of vegetables, including during planting, harvesting, government oversight,
    testing, transportation, customs clearance, warehousing, repackaging, and internal
    testing [46,47]. Every kind of pest and disease is believed to be harmful to plants
    and to have a serious unfavorable effect on horticulture. To decrease the frequent
    use of pesticides and fungicides and to anticipate when pests will arise, the
    IoT system was created [48]. Soft-computing technologies are used to identify
    fruits by combining the three essential characteristics of an object—color, shape,
    and texture. This method reduces the dimensions of the feature vector. As a result,
    the combined and normalized image features produce better classification accuracy
    with fewer training data [49]. Real-time supply-chain monitoring can give stakeholders
    insight into perishable food to better manage to price and take appropriate action
    to uphold quality requirements [50]. Farmers confront a variety of challenges
    when growing vegetables, including issues with seeds, managing pests and diseases,
    commodity costs, and product marketing. Farmers can use the internet and the concept
    of mobile cloud computing to access information and engage in an interactive dialogue
    about vegetable production through mobile learning [51]. A framework for papaya
    grading based on the Artificial Bee Colony algorithm was proposed to classify
    papaya fruits from digital photographs [52,53]. Figure 2 illustrates an architecture
    that was implemented by previous studies for monitoring different parameters in
    horticulture. As discussed in Section 2, one of the key components of the IoT
    is sensors. Sensors such as temperature, soil moisture, humidity, light intensity,
    pH, NPK, and water level are crucial for obtaining important information about
    the soil and environment. Along with these sensors, the camera module is used
    to obtain data from the horticulture field. The sensors remain the same for the
    indoor and outdoor environments of horticulture cultivation. Data on the soil
    and environment are mapped to obtain better productivity by smart controlling
    of irrigation and fertilizer. Based on the soil data, the crop-yield analysis
    is analyzed, and fertilizers can be used as needed. All of these sensors send
    the soil and environment data to the computing unit, at which point the data-sensor
    processor communicates with the cloud server through a wireless-communication
    protocol and gateway. In the cloud server, the data are visualized on the graphical
    user interface. Figure 2. IoT for horticulture. 3.2. AI in Horticulture Fresh
    and wholesome food is essential for feeding the expanding world population, and
    greenhouses and indoor agricultural techniques play a crucial role in this. In
    the past two decades, hyperspectral imaging research has developed, and in the
    decades to come, its use in horticulture is expected to grow. There are still
    challenges to the applicability. The automated detection of pests and diseases
    in plants empowers the effective monitoring of scalable fruit-and-vegetable crops.
    The detection of pests and diseases at the right time enhances pest- and disease-management
    systems [54]. The previous study concluded that AI algorithms can be implemented
    in horticulture for distinct applications, including fruit detection, pest, disease
    detection, weed detection, plant-stress detection, and yield prediction through
    the spectroscopy-and-camera system [55]. A study was implemented to identify common
    pests and diseases in apple fruit using sparse coding. Computer-vision techniques
    can identify pest- and disease-damaged fruits and provide data to assist in the
    detection and treatment of diseases and pests in the early stages [56]. Soil-organic-carbon
    (SOC) monitoring is a crucial characteristic of soil quality because it directly
    determines soil fertility and enables sustainable soil-nutrient management [57].
    To improve SOC prediction, artificial neural networks (ANN), cubist regression,
    support-vector machines (SVM), multiple linear regression (MLR), and random forests
    (RF) were applied to the data of soil-nutrient indicators, total catchment area,
    and the topographic-wetness index. Automatic detection of plant pests and diseases
    can aid in the monitoring of large farms and gardens. The application of AI in
    the drying process of fruits and vegetables has received a lot of attention because
    it can generate better-dried fruit-and-vegetable products when combined with an
    efficient physical field [58,59].An IoT-based tool can determine whether a climacteric
    fruit has been artificially ripened or not. To determine whether the fruit is
    ripened artificially or naturally, machine-learning algorithms are applied [60].
    We discuss these techniques and discuss the significance of combining computer-vision
    techniques with an autonomous robotic system that uses the deep-learning concept
    of artificial intelligence [61]. In order to reduce food waste, one study used
    sensors and analyzed gases produced by certain food products to detect rotten
    food at an early stage and boost accuracy. To forecast how frequently food will
    degrade, the researchers used machine learning, the IoT, and sensors. To assess
    the freshness of food, this study used ML and IoT. The implementation of vision-based
    hardware in robots enables the realization of intelligent spraying, crop-yield
    prediction and price forecasting, predictive insights, and disease diagnosis (Figure
    3). In addition, during the supply chain, the AI-based IoT system enables the
    indoor environment conditions to be adjusted on the basis of external climatic
    conditions and travel time to avoid the spoilage of fruit and vegetables. Figure
    3. AI in horticulture and farming. Table 2 illustrates the different studies that
    implement AI for horticulture crops for disease detection, quality assessment,
    and grading. The table provides the different algorithms that have been implemented
    for feature selection, feature extraction, classification, and regression for
    identifying defects, bruising quality assessment, and grading of the fruit. Different
    studies have used different feature-selection and feature-extraction techniques
    such as random frog, random forest, linear discriminant analysis-based fully convolutional
    networks, competitive adaptive reweighted sampling–successive projection algorithms,
    uninformative variable elimination, successive projection algorithm, gray histograms,
    and gray-level co-occurrence matrices. Classification and regression techniques
    include least-squares support-vector machines, support vector machines, convolutional
    neural networks, logistic regression, random forest, multilayer perceptron, linear
    discriminant analysis, k-nearest neighbors, and backpropagation in the neural
    network. Table 2. AI for horticulture crops. Table 3 illustrates AI implementation
    in horticulture with accuracy and data-acquisition parameters. The previous studies
    illustrate that AI has been implemented for multiple applications such as quality
    assessment of fruit by evaluating moisture levels in the fruits. Following these
    studies, AI was used to forecast the yield of fruits such as bananas and blueberries.
    A few studies implemented AI for the detection and segmentation of apple fruits
    and branches in orchards through fused convolutional features, ResNet-101, clustering-RCNN,
    and CNN. The accuracy of different classifiers is illustrated in the table, and
    SVM, KNN, and DT achieved 100%. During the classification of tomato diseases,
    CNN achieved 99.18% accuracy on the dataset formed from 14,828 images. In the
    detection of citrus fruits, the CNN applied to the UAV images achieved 96.24%
    accuracy. Table 3. AI implementation for horticulture with accuracy and data-acquisition
    sources. 3.3. Blockchain Blockchain is a distributed-ledger technology with the
    advantage of being tamper-resistant to information. It is anticipated to be able
    to address the issue of resource allocation for transactions among numerous unreliable
    parties in the supply chain for fresh fruit [76]. One potential method for supply-chain
    traceability in the pineapple industry is blockchain technology. The fruit-chain
    protocol that was introduced has identical consistency and liveliness qualities
    as assuming an honest majority of computer power [77] and is roughly fair with
    an overwhelming probability. Although blockchain might be viewed as a viable option
    for food-chain traceability, it was determined that [78] the goal of the investigation
    was to learn more about blockchain technology and its potential applications in
    the retail industry. Additionally, potential blockchain uses that might help the
    retail sector and the wider industry are foreseen. The study also underlined the
    crucial role that blockchain technology plays in the retail sector for fruit as
    well as the connections between these aspects [79]. Figure 4 shows blockchain
    technology in horticulture. The blockchain enables a distributed network to be
    established among the different entities in the supply chain for real-time monitoring
    and tracking of the activities from any location that is immutable and transparent.
    Blockchain empowers digital and secure trading to be created by incorporating
    smart contracts between entities. In addition, blockchain enables the realization
    of secured transactions of the export of fruits and vegetables in the international
    market. The quality and standards of the fruits and vegetables that are set by
    international bodies can be protected with secured hash cryptography. Figure 4.
    Blockchain technology in horticulture. Consumers are driving an entirely different
    transformation in food procurement as a consequence of the growth in global food
    catastrophes that are triggering health insecurity. Consumers have called for
    transparency, traceability, and attentiveness along the entire fruit supply chain.
    The importance of the supply chain in this industry is increased by the fact that
    the products are perishable and have a limited shelf life. Yields are impacted
    by inconsistent delivery and a lack of fertilizers and insecticides as a result
    of dependence on middlemen, market instability, and other factors. Increased costs
    for input and transportation, post-harvest losses, and problems with safety and
    quality dominating supply-chain losses are key challenges involved in the fruit
    supply chain. Blockchain integration in the fruit supply chain (Figure 5) allows
    for post-harvest and inventory management streamlining, increasing operational
    effectiveness and lowering losses. End-to-end traceability with QR codes on the
    fruits presents the final customer with an honest and reliable narrative. A fair
    price for the producers is ensured by the grouping and collaboration of all stakeholders
    on a single platform, which fosters confidence and transparency. Real-time data
    collection allows for simple tracking and tracing, which helps with recall management.
    In addition to this, blockchain is used for monitoring the pre-harvest process
    for yield and quality. Post-harvest management for monitoring the crucial phases
    to prevent losses and boost output, monitoring a set of procedures for confirming
    sustainable practices, and digital records that cannot be altered and display
    accurate information are necessary to meet legal requirements. Figure 5. Applications
    of blockchain for Horticulture 4.0. 3.4. Big Data in Horticulture A multi-sensor
    network system was established to accumulate smaller ecological statistical data
    on vegetable-growing regions. Researchers were able to identify the critical components
    pushing pest spread using multidimensional information such as environment, soil,
    meteorology of vegetable fields, and ultimately the vegetable-pest warning system
    premised on multidimensional big data [80]. The distinctive nutrition-based vegetable-production
    and -distribution system utilizes the inventive big-data framework and its multiple
    benefits to provide a healthful food recommendation to the end customer as well
    as various predictive analyses to boost system efficacy [45]. The new ICT horticulture
    project will heavily rely on big-data methodologies; therefore, it is important
    to understand how to manage them and how they could affect everyday business [81]
    Big-data intervention in horticulture is presented in Figure 6. Because fruits
    and vegetables are produced in such large quantities, the sensor data that are
    available and can be used in horticulture are now considered big data. The big
    data can be transmitted to the cloud server and made available in a distribution
    box and control box through wireless-communication protocols. Figure 6. Big-data
    overview in horticulture. 4. Results In this section, the results identified from
    the analysis of previous studies based on Industry 4.0 integration for horticulture
    monitoring are discussed. The IoT is predominantly used in horticulture to monitor
    various pests and diseases that are harmful to plants and have a serious negative
    impact on horticulture. The Internet of Things system was configured to minimize
    the frequency with which pesticides and fungicides are used and to predict when
    pests will appear. Along with this, IoT and cloud computing are employed to identify
    fruits by combining an object’s three essential characteristics—color, shape,
    and texture. Farmers face a variety of challenges when growing vegetables, including
    seed issues, pest-and-disease management, commodity costs, and product marketing.
    Farmers can access information and engage in an interactive process about vegetable
    production through the internet and the concept of the mobile cloud. AI in horticulture
    enables the detection of diseases, quality assessment, and grading of horticulture
    crops. Linear discriminant analysis-based fully convolutional networks, random
    forest, competitive adaptive reweighted sampling–successive projection algorithm,
    uninformative variable elimination, successive projection algorithm, and gray-level
    co-occurrence matrix have been used for feature extraction and selection. Least-squares
    support-vector machine, support-vector machine, convolutional neural networks,
    logistic regression, random forest, multilayer perceptron, and k-nearest neighbors
    are the key techniques used for classification and regression. Yields are impacted
    by inconsistent delivery and a lack of fertilizers and insecticides as a result
    of dependence on middlemen, market instability, and other factors. Increased input
    and transportation costs, post-harvest losses, and safety and quality issues dominate
    supply-chain losses. However, the incorporation of blockchain improves pre-harvest
    and post-harvest management through real-time tracing and secure transactions
    in the distributed network. 5. Discussion and Recommendation In this section,
    based on the discussion of the analysis above, we discuss the recommendations
    for applications in horticulture as part of future work. A few vital recommendations
    are as follows: When considering long-term benefits like improved production and
    automation, the use of the IoT in horticulture is strongly advised and very successful.
    The Internet of Drones enables horticulture operations to be improved. The Internet
    of Drones is an architecture intended to focus on providing UAVs, also commonly
    known as drones, with coordinated connectivity to controlled airspace. Drones
    for horticulture are used to monitor fields, plant crops, irrigate fields, spray
    pesticides, and also to assess the health of plants [82,83]. Moreover, drones
    with vision-based technology and AI empower the detection of weeds and identify
    the stages of the growth of plants in pre-harvest, harvest, and post-harvest.
    Drones can be used to monitor the quality assessment and grading of horticulture
    crops to minimize the damage and loss of the product during transportation and
    storage. Robotics leverage AI technology to improve harvest quality and precision.
    In horticulture settings, robotics with vision technology and AI for the detection
    of pests, plant diseases, and malnutrition. Before choosing which herbicide to
    apply in a region, AI can detect and target weeds through the visuals obtained
    from the camera module inserted into robots. A wide range of issues in the farming
    sector can be resolved by using an amalgamation of robots and AI approaches [84].
    In addition to this, currently, different robots with AI technology are used for
    weed removal and plucking, sorting, and packaging of fruits [85]. Globally, horticulture
    supply chains have an exciting opportunity to improve transactional efficiency,
    reduce resistance, and promote traceability thanks to blockchain technology [80].
    Blockchain technology can help the horticulture and food industry deal with and
    control known risks while maintaining affordability across the ecosystem. Blockchain
    in horticulture enables the linking of various horticultural entities for the
    visualization of data from production to supply on distributed-ledger networks.
    Granular information on rainfall patterns, water cycles, fertilizer requirements,
    and more are made available to farmers through big data. This enables them to
    make wise decisions, such as which plants to sow for greater profitability and
    when to harvest. Making the proper choices ultimately increase crop output. The
    fundamental goal of precision horticulture is to guarantee profitability, efficacy,
    and sustainability [86]. In horticulture, edge computing is employed for different
    activities. Edge computing can be utilized to analyze the data at the edge of
    a network for better monitoring and productivity. Mobile edge computing (MEC)
    is an architecture that provides cloud-computing services at the edge of networks
    leveraging mobile base stations [87,88]. Currently, different study areas have
    implemented edge-computing-based portable devices in order to predict what is
    useful for the user in enhancing their practices [89,90]. In the scenario of horticulture,
    an edge-computing-based portable device can be developed with IoT and AI for predicting
    and estimating disease in a crop. Based on the analysis and prediction, it can
    also communicate to the user on the cloud server and the respective horticulture
    authorities to suggest a solution in real-time. Figure 7 illustrates a hybrid
    architecture that is implemented in horticulture with the amalgamation of the
    IoT, cloud computing, AI/ML, blockchain, and big data. This architecture enables
    a smart and intelligent ecosystem to be achieved in horticulture with multiple
    features such as blockchain-assisted marketing, prediction of international markets,
    and the quality of fruits and vegetables based on real-time environmental data.
    The generated output and sensor data can then be distributed in the peer-to-peer
    network of any location. Figure 7. Hybrid architecture for Horticulture 4.0. 6.
    Conclusions Horticulture is the field of cultivation of fruits and vegetables.
    It ensures production and consumption by minimizing malnutrition in the current
    scenario addressed by United Nations. Recently, Industry 4.0 technologies have
    delivered the ability of digitalization and realize the SDGs set by the United
    Nations. The previous studies did not highlight the significance and application
    of Industry 4.0 for distinct issues of horticulture. Based on this limitation,
    the current study addressed the significance and application of Industry 4.0 technologies
    such as the Internet of Things, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, blockchain,
    and big data for horticulture to enhance traditional practices of disease detection,
    irrigation management, fertilizer management, maturity identification, marketing,
    and supply chain, soil fertility, and weather patterns at pre-harvest, harvest,
    and post-harvest. The findings of the study are as follows: in horticulture, the
    IoT is primarily used to monitor various pests and diseases that are harmful to
    plants and have a serious negative impact on horticulture. In addition, IoT and
    cloud computing is used to identify fruits by combining three essential characteristics
    of an object: color, shape, and texture.AI in horticulture has enabled the detection
    of diseases, quality assessment, and crop grading. For feature extraction and
    selection, we used fully convolutional networks, a random forest, and a competitive
    adaptive reweighted sampling–successive projection algorithm based on linear discriminant
    analysis. The key techniques used for classification and regression are the least-squares
    support-vector machine, support-vector machine, convolutional neural networks,
    logistic regression, multilayer perceptron, and k-nearest neighbors. Inconsistent
    delivery and a lack of fertilizers and insecticides as an outcome of dependence
    on middlemen, market instability, and other factors have a negative impact on
    yields. Increased input and transportation costs, post-harvest losses, and safety
    and quality issues that dominate supply-chain losses can be overcome with blockchain
    during-harvest and post-harvest management. Finally, the study suggested vital
    recommendations for future works, such as robotics; drones with vision technology
    and AI for the detection of pests, weeds, plant diseases, and malnutrition; and
    edge computing portable devices developed with the IoT and AI for predicting and
    estimating disease in crops. Author Contributions Conceptualization, R.S. (Rajesh

    Agriculture Chapter © 2024 1 Introduction The Internet of Things (IoT) has significantly
    altered our way of life. From smart wearables to smart refrigerators that adapt
    to our demands, it has permeated every aspect of our life. Additionally, automobiles
    use them (self-driving). Today’s fuel is data. It is currently utilised throughout
    all sectors of society. The three technologies that are closely related to data
    are blockchain, machine learning, and the internet of things. The creation of
    data and services is made possible by the Internet of Things devices, which also
    give computers a way to communicate with the real world. Blockchains offer a mechanism
    to record data and transactions in an unchangeable form. Machine learning is used
    to make sense of the data obtained and use those insights to achieve a larger
    goal. IoT devices and data will be sold as commodities in the market, just like
    cloud services and physical goods, as a result of the IoT ecosystem’s rapid expansion.
    A significant IoT service exchange is creating a trade platform. Attempts have
    been made to create a system where IoT services are traded like commodities. However,
    the primary issues here are data security and privacy [4]. For the reasons outlined
    in the following sections, a centralised system where one must blindly trust a
    third party is no longer a viable option in the current world. A decentralised
    system built on the blockchain is required because it eliminates the requirement
    for a reliable third party by enabling users to independently verify data and
    ensure its immutability [5]. IoT devices can use blockchain to register themselves
    and organize store, share streams of data effectively and reliably. Blockchains
    like Ethereum provide a notion of smart contracts. On the blockchain, smart contracts
    are stored as code or scripts. They are set off by specific circumstances. The
    ability to automate processes on the blockchain is provided by smart contracts
    to developers. Like entities that live on the blockchain, smart contracts. On
    the blockchain, they are connected to their own address and account. The project’s
    goal is to use smart contracts to automate exchanges of goods, services, and data
    between two entities on the blockchain with little to no human involvement. Every
    gadget whose data or service is available for trade or exchange can be given an
    account using blockchain technology. Therefore, by giving the devices access to
    their blockchain, the blockchains deal with the devices as participants in the
    exchange, which prevents fraud in transactions. A basic trading platform for irrigation
    services between farmers and the service providers who have placed IoT devices
    all over the place is constructed as a proof of concept. This platform can be
    very helpful in a nation like India where agriculture is significant. The farmers
    sign up for the site and are given a blockchain-connected account that they may
    use to conduct transactions. They might request that the soil moisture be monitored
    and that it be irrigated when it falls below a certain threshold. These kinds
    of attempts are made utilising the conventional centralised client-server approach,
    which has a lot of issues [3]. With the exception of the farmer’s first request,
    all of these tasks are entirely automated. The fact that the blockchain has cryptocurrency
    associated with it, which can be used for payments, is another benefit of it.
    The moisture level of the soil in the farmers’ fields can be updated in real time.
    When irrigation is required, automatic transactions between the accounts linked
    to the device and the farmer take place. The smart contract is written in Solidity,
    and the prototype is built on the Ethereum blockchain. Section 2 gives the brief
    overview of the works previously done in the field. Section 3 contains information
    about the Approaches and Mechanisms used to build the prototype. Section 4 contains
    information about the results obtained, i.e the working of the prototype. Section
    5 contains discussion regarding the advantages and disadvantages of using blockchain
    as a basis for such a platform and also how the present model can be extended.
    2 Literature Review The project’s objective is to provide a platform where farmers
    can easily and safely access irrigation services from a variety of vendors. This
    entails offering farmers IoT device-based services for tracking the soil’s moisture
    content and also implementing irrigation when the moisture content is low. Farmers
    ought to be able to monitor the soil’s moisture level in real time. Additionally,
    as much as practicable, the actions conducted are to be automated. In order to
    develop such an Internet of Things (IoT) based system for tracking the moisture
    level of the fields, Rao et al. [3] discuss the numerous tools and equipment required.
    In this article, the authors primarily concentrate on the actual tools required
    to monitor and irrigate the field. The authors also provide the fundamental circuitry
    needed to construct such an infrastructure. Hub et al.’s [6] discussion of the
    framework needed to combine the physical IoT infrastructure with the blockchain-based
    platform for managing and monitoring IoT device performance. The mechanism is
    automated through the use of smart contracts and the Ethereum [2] blockchain.
    Additionally, it advises using asymmetric key cryptography to give the system
    the necessary security. The best practises for combining blockchain technology
    with IoT devices are discussed by Fernandez et al. [4] and Christidis et al. [7],
    S. Huh et al. [11]. According to Dogan et al. [5], creating the data marketplace
    utilising blockchains for data produced by IoT devices is discussed. Additionally,
    by developing a prototype for the same on the Ethereum network, this gives a clear
    proof of concept. 3 Approaches and Mechanisms 3.1 Comparison of the Two Model
    - Cloud Based and Decentralized As was already noted, the project’s objective
    is to provide a platform where farmers can easily and safely access irrigation
    services from a variety of providers. In order to do this, IoT device-based services
    are offered to farmers, who can use them to monitor the soil’s moisture level
    and apply irrigation when it is low. Farmers ought to be able to monitor the soil’s
    moisture level in real time. Additionally, the steps conducted must be as automatic
    as possible. In order to build a system or platform where the IoT devices are
    exchanged or are allowed to be used in exchange for money, two approaches can
    be used [3, 4]. Centralized Cloud model: The first system is a centralised one
    that uses cloud computing resources. When IoT device services or transactions
    take place through the platform, the cloud serves as the platform’s trusted third
    party. As a result, attacks like Denial of Service are possible given this centralised
    approach (DoS). A single point of failure exists in the centralised system as
    well. Additionally, a significant number of IoT devices are being used in our
    daily lives, and more are predicted to be added rapidly in the near future. We
    utilise gadgets like wearable smart devices, smart air conditioners, and smart
    refrigerators every day. Therefore, there are too many devices for a single centralised
    system to manage. IoT devices are also available whose services are needed in
    real-time by customers. However, in a centralised system, every data travelling
    must contend with other internet traffic in order to reach its destination, stopping
    at the cloud for any additional processing. This is a slightly inappropriate way
    to establish the market for IoT device services on top of it due to all of these
    problems. Various stakeholders are interested in such a platform, which is centred
    on exchanging or selling IoT services. Five essential primitives (roles), according
    to the National Institute of Standards and Technology, are utilised in actual
    Internet of Things applications [8]. IoT sensors are devices that produce data.
    Data aggregation infrastructure includes edge, fog, and mist. Communication channels:
    services offered by communication service providers for wired or wireless communication.
    eUtility: Cloud-based SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS services. Processes for enacting decisions,
    such as pipelines for data analysis. Each of these services is frequently offered
    by a distinct provider who is unaware of the identity of the other supplier. So
    the only option is to put your trust in a single party. The party which gives
    the sensor data has no idea how the data will be used by the party consuming it.
    Additionally, the entity consuming the data is unaware of the accuracy of the
    data it has received. Thus, we require a different strategy. So we need a different
    approach. Blockchain-based decentralised model: Establishing trust amongst the
    numerous parties participating in such a system is one of the main challenges.
    Users of the cloud-based approach are compelled to believe the centralised cloud
    without question. They lack any other option. But it shouldn’t be like this. The
    blockchain is a novel data sharing mechanism that resolves this problem by doing
    away with the requirement for a reliable third party. It brings in the needed
    trust by maintaining the immutable database or ledger, which cannot be easily
    tampered with. All the participants hold a copy of this, and the system tries
    to maintain consensus among the participants, by using several distributed consensus
    algorithms. As a result, the following benefits [8] can be attained by employing
    the blockchain to oversee the trade of IoT device services: IoT devices may share
    data through the blockchain without relying on a third party. The blockchain entries,
    which keep track of all the transactions, can be used to track the data produced
    by various sources. Better service providers gain significantly more than less
    effective service providers. The supplied data’s integrity is safeguarded. Therefore,
    rather than building it on the cloud, it is preferable to develop the aforementioned
    platform (marketplace for IoT device-based services) on blockchain technology.
    3.2 What is Block Chain? A Blockchain is a distributed data structure, whose copies
    are stored in the nodes of the network. These copies, ideally, are exactly the
    same as each other. The concept of Blockchainwas introduced as part of the Bitcoin
    [1], a cryptocurrency aimed at solving the double spending problem. The blockchain
    is nothing but a linked list that is supposed to be immutable. Blockchain consists
    of a series of blocks that are time-stamped and identified by their unique cryptographic
    hash. Every block references the hash of its previous block. This is one of the
    main reasons for the immutability property of the blockchain. This forms a link
    between the block and its previous one, leading to the formation of a chain of
    blocks, called blockchain. Every node on the blockchain network holds a copy of
    this blockchain. A node can act as an entry point for many users (of blockchain)
    into the network. These nodes form a peer-to-peer network. In this network [7]:
    The users hold private-public key pairs. The private key [10] is used by the user
    to sign his transaction. Therefore the private key acts as the digital signature
    of the user in the blockchain network. The public key, which is accessible to
    other users in the network, is used to verify the signed transactions. The use
    of asymmetric cryptography brings authentication and integrity into the blockchain
    network. Such signed transactions are broadcasted by a users node to its neighbours
    (one-hop peers). The neighbouring peers check the validity of the transaction
    before relaying it to its neighbours. Invalid transactions are dropped. Eventually,
    the transaction is broadcasted to the entire network. The above valid transactions
    are collected and packaged into a time stamped candidate block. This process is
    called mining. The mining node issues this block back to the network. The nodes
    check the broadcasted block for its validity and add it to their blockchain if
    valid. As said before, there is no trusted third party in a blockchain network.
    So a way has to be found to help the network reach consensus, mainly regarding
    the validity of the blocks. So a blockchain network needs a set of rules to which
    all its nodes should oblige. These rules are programmed into the nodes, which
    are used when creating a transaction or while receiving one. When each node in
    the network follows the set rules, it is possible to bring consensus without having
    to blindly believe a third party. Here belief is on the mathematics of cryptography
    used and not on a third party. So a blockchain operates in a trustless environment.
    Using a blockchain provides a convenient billing layer for using the services
    and gives way to the creation of a marketplace of services between devices [7].
    Using this technology, we can allocate an account to every IoT device, treating
    them as participants of the transactions and not just objects that are traded.
    This further helps in the main goal of automating all these transactions. 3.3
    How to Apply the Above-Mentioned Concept to the Problem of Creating a Market Place
    for Sharing Irrigation Service and also Automating It? A blockchain for the platform
    has to be created. The service providers should register every one of their devices
    they intend to use. This creates an account for every device. The consumer should
    also register and create an account in the blockchain. Therefore this blockchain
    is a permissioned one that is not open to everyone but should register with the
    platform before being able to use the blockchain. There can be two types of blockchains.
    Permissionless blockchain: This is an open network that allows anyone to join
    or quit the network. The incentives are provided for being a part of the network
    and mining the blocks. The consensus mechanisms used are mostly Proof-of-Work
    or Proof-of-Stake. Permissioned blockchain: Only the registered participants are
    allowed to participate in the blockchain network. Privacy is preserved as the
    public is not allowed to participate. Consensus mechanisms like Byzantine Fault
    tolerance used. Incentives for participation rarely seen. Once the account is
    created, the service providers create a smart [11] contract on the blockchain
    for every device, which controls the way the device has to behave and the way
    the money (or cryptocurrency) is transferred between the account of the device
    and that of the consumer, who in this case is the farmer requesting the services.
    All the transactions occur according to the rules set by the smart contract. As
    the smart contract is visible to everyone on the network to see, no fraud can
    be done. The block chain will be based on Ethereum, which also provides the needed
    smart contracts. The smart contracts will be run on the EVM (Ethereum virtual
    machine) on the nodes of the Ethereum network 3.4 Ethereum Ethereum [2], proposed
    by Vatalik Buterin in 2013, is a public blockchain-based distributed computing
    platform. Unlike, bitcoin, the original blockchain network, it can work as a computer.
    But the performance is lower compared to normal cloud-based computing. The code
    that is stored on Ethereum is called smart contract and is written in languages
    like Solidity. The code is compiled to bytecode and stored on the Ethereum blockchain.
    Ethereum nodes comprise of three components. The blockchain The peer-to-peer communication
    layer. The Ethereum virtual machine The Ethereum virtual machine is what runs
    the byte code of the smart contract. Ethereum combines the computing system with
    blockchain. Storing the code on the blockchain saves it from malicious tampering.
    Processing code on Ethereum costs gas, which acts as the economic incentive to
    the nodes performing the computation 3.5 Smart Contracts A computerised transaction
    system called a “smart contract” [2] performs a contract’s terms. Smart contracts
    are scripts that are kept on the blockchain in the context of the technology.
    They have a specific blockchain address. They could be seen as autonomous actors,
    or entities that live on the blockchain. As a result, the idea of decentralised
    autonomous organisations is born. The smart contract is activated under specific
    circumstances, which causes the programming it contains to run. Smart contracts
    enable general-purpose computations to take place across the chain. A smart contract
    is a piece of deterministic code that, when executed under identical circumstances,
    produces the same outcome. In essence, a smart contract connects several entities
    to create a system that performs specific activities. We can run general-purpose
    code on the blockchain, more precisely the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) of the
    network’s nodes, thanks to the Turing-complete characteristic of smart contracts
    in Ethereum. 3.6 How to Use the Proposed Marketplace Platform? The consumer (farmer)
    interacts with the blockchain and obtains the services offered by the registered
    devices using the web-based interface. He chooses the necessary instrument and
    instructs it to begin monitoring the amount of moisture in the soil in his field.
    These tools are deployed in the farmers’ fields by the provider and are the providers’
    property, not the farmers’. If the device detects during tracking that the moisture
    level is below the critical level, it begins irrigating the land with the available
    water supply while deducting the appropriate amount from the customer’s account.
    Everything is carried out automatically. The procedure is therefore automated.
    The moisture level of the farmer’s land is constantly visible. As all the transactions
    are saved in the blockchain with the timestamp, it is almost impossible to perform
    any fraudulent activities. 3.7 A Prototype of the Idea as Proof of Concept A prototype
    of the model as the proof of concept to the above idea has been created. The created
    model simplifies the problem statement by providing provision for a single consumer
    and a single device from the given provider. This model can be extended to allow
    multiple users and multiple parallel transactions. The code for the model can
    be seen at https://github.com/govardhangdg/seproject Ganache is used to produce
    the in-memory Ethereum test blockchain needed for the model, which can be accessed
    and interacted with via the JSON-RPC protocol as advised by Ethereum to create
    dApps (decentralized applications). The service’s necessary files are provided
    to the customer’s browser via the prototype, a NodeJS programme that runs an HTTP
    server. The Solidity programming language is used to create the smart contract
    for the code. Web3.js is used to programmatically connect with the blockchain
    from the NodeJS app. An add-on called Metamask, which internally uses the same
    web3.js as mentioned above, is used to transform a standard browser into one that
    can communicate with the blockchain. The official solc compiler is used to translate
    the solidity code into bytecode that the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) can understand.
    Then, as the first block following the genesis block, the byte code is introduced
    to the blockchain. Every subsequent transaction uses the smart contract’s address,
    which is kept. To provide a web-based interface for the software, a simple HTML
    page is created. A process that delivers simulated moisture levels at regular
    intervals is created in order to imitate the sensor readings. When the moisture
    condition is lower than the critical moisture condition, the main app responds
    in response to this. Every time the moisture content falls below the threshold,
    an event is set off, a new blockchain transaction is made, and the moisture content
    is raised by simulated watering (which is just a message from the main process
    to the process simulating sensor readings). Once the time of tracking asked by
    the consumer is passed, the tracking is stopped. 4 Results A prototype is made
    as a proof-of-concept to demonstrate how the suggested model for automating transactions
    between the device and the consumer for the irrigation service will operate. The
    Ethereum blockchain is used to build the prototype, and smart contracts are used
    to automate the transactions. The smart contract keeps track of the two parties’
    transaction’s current state and is programmed to start various actions when certain
    conditions are satisfied, such as when moisture content falls below a threshold.
    The prototype’s smart contract is depicted in the diagram below. Its user interface
    is web-based. The smart contract for the prototype is given in the Fig. 1. The
    web interface shows the address where the necessary contract is set up as well
    as the accounts linked to the customer and the service-providing device. The user
    must specify how long he wants the device to keep an eye on his field. When the
    duration has passed, a smart contract event is triggered, ending the tracking.
    Fig. 1. Smart contract prototype Full size image The contract is initially deployed
    to the blockchain when the app is launched using the code contained in the deploy.js
    and compile.js files. When this occurs, a little amount of ether is taken out
    of the device’s account to cover the cost of deploying the contract. Following
    the contract’s deployment, the customer specifies the number of hours he wants
    to use the service; this generates a transaction that modifies the smart contract’s
    state and adds a new block to the blockchain. The sequence diagram for the proposed
    model as shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 2. Sequence diagram of the model Full size image
    The expense of the tracking is transferred to the account of the device. The prototype
    also offers the opportunity to view the field’s moisture content. The result is
    as shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 3. The graph depicting the performance of the model when
    provided with the soil moisture data from the data hosted Full size image The
    link opens up a graph that shows the moisture in real time. Every time the moisture
    goes below critical level an event is triggered and transfer of funds from the
    consumer to device occurs and the service (irrigation) is provided. 5 Discussion
    The presented simulates the actual functioning of a similar platform in real life.
    Attempts are made in creating a similar system, based on the Cloud-based model.
    The major disadvantages of using a cloud-based model have been discussed in the
    above sections. The project can be extended in directions as mentioned below:
    IPFS: A distributed storage system that is compatible with the Ethereum blockchain
    is IPFS. https://ipfs.io/. It can be used to give the data generated during the
    tracking period a storage facility. Scientists and data analysts can use the generated
    data to gain profound insights into specific issues. The same methodology can
    be utilised to construct a data marketplace where this data is sold as a commodity.
    The real-time data that is gathered can be saved on IPFS as a file (csv). The
    consumer with the proper private key can access the data stored in the IPFS and
    encrypt it using asymmetric key cryptography techniques [5]. The inclusion of
    multiple providers, devices and consumers: To simplify the implementation, The
    simple case of a single provider, a single device and a single consumer is considered
    here. This can be extended to include multiple parties interacting with each other
    in a suitable manner. A system to search providers, who fall under certain conditions,
    can also be implemented. A chat system can also be created between two interacting
    parties with the help of whisper protocol of Ethereum. Addition of the actual
    hardware: To make the implementation simpler, Here, moisture values from the sensor
    are simulated using a method. Instead, the model can be improved by utilising
    a Raspberry Pi and the appropriate sensors to read the soil’s moisture level.
    The new sensor module should merge seamlessly with the current code. The only
    thing that has to be changed is the source of the incoming data stream from the
    readings simulator procedure to the actual sensor data [3]. Including edge nodes
    for computation: Instead of just providing raw data to the consumers, edge nodes
    (fog computing concept) can be added to the platform at the edges (next to IoT
    sensors) to process the data before providing it to the consumers. A RaspberryPi
    may be used to process the data obtained from the sensors before providing it
    to the consumers, in the extension mentioned above [9]. 5.1 Concerns Regarding
    Using Blockchain for Such a Platform Even though using Blockchain as the basis
    for the proposed platform brings a lot of advantages, it is not the silver bullet
    that solves all the problems. Instead, it brings along its own set of concerns
    [4]. Passing ownership of the devices: Suitable steps should be taken when the
    ownership of the device is transferred. This is very important because the trust
    of the consumers on the new provider and hence the device in question can be affected.
    The data possessed by the device can be used by the new owner in a way that is
    not recommended. Bringing about the privacy of transactions: This is really a
    tough problem to solve as even though public keys are used to identify a device
    or a consumer on the blockchain, these devices or consumers can be identified
    in the real world based on the coincidences in the activities on the chain and
    in the real world. So a balance in the privacy and openness in the transaction
    history is to be achieved, which is a delicate matter. Throughput and latency:
    Blockchains deliberately restrict the number of transactions that can be made
    in a given time. This affects the performance of the system when a lot of IoT
    based transactions have to be made simultaneously. Hardcore real-time applications
    suffer from this. Even though the problem cant be completely solved, steps must
    be taken in eradicating the problem. Energy efficiency: Mining nodes with consensus
    mechanisms like Proof-of-Work is computationally expensive. As computing is inevitable,
    something useful is to be com puted. Like the primes etc. Adoption Rate: The blockchain
    enables pseudonymity. Thus people can misuse this privacy given to them. This
    is not a problem in the permissioned blockchains but may turn out to be one if
    public blockchains are to be used for the purpose. Usability: Creating applications
    over blockchain is not as easy as creating one over the traditional and conventional,
    centralized server-client model. As a result, there aren’t many people who are
    interested in taking up such ambitious projects. The problem is expected to be
    mitigated with the formation and development of a community worldwide who are
    interested in creating decentralized applications or dApps. Dealing with forks:
    As blockchain is a distributed system, disagreements regarding the state of the
    blockchain can occur, mainly in the form of the forks. It is very important to
    deal with the forks in a way that doesn’t cause problems to the consumers or providers
    using the platform. Lack of legal governance: Rules regarding the usage of blockchain
    technology are not strict or not even formed in many countries. Lack of such rules
    severely hinders the widespread adoption of the technology 6 Conclusion As discussed
    in the previous sections, there can be two important approaches to building a
    marketplace for the IoT device based services. One is the traditional centralized
    system and the other is the blockchain based decentralized system. As mentioned
    above, the centralized system requires too much of trust to be placed on the third
    party, which can be dangerous and is also subjected to problems like single point
    of failure etc. On the other hand, the blockchain based solution solves most of
    the problems faced by the centralized system. But this comes with its own set
    of problems, which can be solved with proper legal support. In the end, the blockchain
    based solution provides the required security and protection for the proposed
    system. References Nakamoto, S., et al.: Bitcoin: a peer-to-peer electronic cash

    1 Introduction The coffee production in Vietnam has developed as the world’s second
    biggest producer of coffee production and export for several decades. However,
    Vietnam coffee now faces several challenges, including the following ones: (1)
    climate change: the coffee production is heavily affected due to tropical storms,
    the worst droughts, rising temperatures, and shifting rainfall patterns. 50% of
    the current Robusta coffee production areas in Vietnam are forecasted to be lost
    by 2050; (2) low productivity, poor quality and high cost: caused by ground-water
    loss and soil pollution in most of the coffee planting regions. About 50% of total
    coffee trees are between 10 and 15 years old. Aging trees, unsuitable lands and
    no sustainable solution for growing coffee plants will directly affect the productivity,
    quality of Vietnamese coffee products, and production costs; (3) excessive use
    of fertilizing products and irrigations: causing coffee trees to quickly become
    exhausted and soil to be severely polluted, with more diseases and harmful pests
    for coffee trees; (4) poor collection, processing, and storage solution: causing
    low quality and unstable productions; (5) low sustainability and limited value-added
    coffee products: the value-added products and types from coffee are limited, and
    the coffee waste and ground are mainly sent to landfill, with no recycling; and
    (6) low applications of smart and sustainable agriculture solutions [1,2,3,4,5,6,7].
    Regards to the last challenge, there are limited applications of smart agriculture
    solutions to enhance the value streams of the coffee supply chain in Vietnam,
    including IoT, smart devices, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), precision agriculture,
    hi-tech solutions for processing and recycling coffee, AI, big data, blockchain
    and source traceability technologies, eco-design, and sustainable manufacturing.
    Compared to Brazil, the productivity of coffee in Indonesia and Vietnam is lower
    but the number of smallholder coffee farmers is higher. The root of the problem
    is the coffee farming practices in Indonesia and most small-scale farms in Vietnam
    are still based on traditional methods with trial and error. Therefore, in order
    to actually change the way of coffee farming practices in Vietnam and Indonesia,
    the digital transformation and the integration of smart and hi-tech agriculture
    for the coffee supply chain and value chain must be considered, and also include
    the sustainable practices that consist of continuous improvement in environmental,
    social, and financial aspects. Application of the IoT through a network of wireless
    sensors in a coffee farm for monitoring and control of its environmental variables
    have currently been studied [8]. The study showed that the management of coffee
    cultivation is quite complex due to the large number of varieties found, the terrain
    and environmental conditions affecting the production process and the final grain
    quality. Also, the development and implementation of wireless sensor networks
    is possible today due to factors such as the reduction of device costs and the
    use of open-source software, avoiding additional licensing values. One of the
    main problems with coffee plants is, however, that high humidity can, in fact,
    impact the activity of the sensors and their monitoring tools. There are numerous
    limitations when harvesting and production processes are optimized. Vietnam has
    a great potential to encourage investment in agriculture. The proliferation of
    new technologies has enabled the enhancement and automation of industrial processes
    in all fields of production such as coffee. Therefore, aided by technology, an
    agricultural sector such as coffee production can strongly improve the country’s
    productivity and give enormous benefits for production processes and the optimization
    of final products [9, 10]. Precision agriculture includes many activities such
    as the management of trees, flowers, crops, and plants. Pest and disease management
    is one of its most interesting applications. By the suitable use of sensors, parameters
    (such as soil temperature and relative humidity, leaf temperature and humidity,
    and solar radiation) can also be measured to quickly detect adverse and appropriate
    situations. In addition, this technology can help to manage the time-based detection
    and the efficiently space-based use of pesticides [2]. Hi-tech solutions for processing
    and recycling coffee have some great benefits and add significant values to the
    coffee value chain. For example, not only does it divert waste away from landfill,
    but the spent coffee grounds can be used to produce some value-added things like
    biofuels, bioactives, and anticancer drugs. It can also help businesses save money
    on their waste disposal [11, 12]. In this paper, the innovative and smart agriculture
    platform for the creation and operation of sustainable coffee value chain, with
    the focus on enhanced quality and added values for key elements of the coffee
    supply chain in Vietnam, taking into account the issues related to sustainability,
    well-aligned with United Nations Sustainable Goals. The platform is designed based
    on the foundations of the key enabling digital transformation and smart agriculture
    technologies: smart devices and Internet of Things, big data, artificial intelligence,
    blockchain and source traceability technologies, and sustainable design and manufacturing.
    2 Development of an Innovative and Smart Agriculture Platform Figure 1 presents
    the research method for development of an innovative and smart agriculture platform,
    called the INNSA platform, with the highlights of the key steps and tools. Firstly,
    the data types and sources are very important for development of the smart agriculture
    systems, in which the real-time data collection and analysis needs to be optimally
    implemented. Then, the latest development of the digital transformation technologies
    needs to be taken into account, when working on data collections and analysis,
    and development of the smart platform and ecosystem of INNSA, including smart
    devices and Internet of Things, big data, artificial intelligence, blockchain
    and source traceability technologies, and sustainable design and manufacturing.
    Finally, value-added products and services in the value chain of the INNSA platform
    and its related ecosystems are developed, with the focus on the cost-effective
    and innovative solutions, including the hardware, software, smart devices, e-commerce
    platform, and innovative products from coffee trees, beans, and wastes. Fig. 1
    Research methods for development of the INNSA platform Full size image 2.1 Data
    Type, Sources, and Collections for Development the INNSA Platform A critical analysis
    and industrial investigations were done, with the use of both primary and secondary
    data, including the journal article data, open-source data about agriculture,
    and farming industry from both governmental and industry reports. The primary
    data from surveys, interviews, and sensor-based supply chain operations was also
    collected for value chain mapping, developing, and validating the INNSA platform.
    The data sources included farm soils, environmental conditions, farm types, products
    from coffee farms and food wastes, and key stakeholders in the coffee supply chain
    and value chain. They also included the information about currently used agriculture
    technologies (robots, temperature and moisture sensors, aerial images, IoT, and
    GPS) and products such as fertilizer for growing plants and precision agriculture.
    The data architecture of the smart database was designed with capability of continuous
    update and co-creation, and automatic updates from smart devices and IoT, with
    options for the IP right licenses and open access. To maximize productivity of
    a coffee farm, certain factors related to soil, weather, and environmental conditions
    must be met. The INNSA platform was designed to collect and analyze farm soil,
    weather, and ecosystem factors, focusing on high-yield variables of coffee plants.
    Based on real-time data monitored and obtained, our platform produced reports
    and suggestions of the best agricultural practices which the users can follow
    to approach the highest productivity. This is based on agronomical science and
    farmers’ experience knowledge to produce these reports and suggestions exactly
    and rapidly. Besides, the INNSA platform also guided the users with farming practices
    to explore their resources in an efficient and effective manner. A sustainable
    concept was developed based on cost-effective and time-saving plans to bring to
    precise agricultural practices. To set up the INNSA platform, two main components
    were designed: IoT devices using LoRa waves [13] and AI [7, 9]. In particular,
    the LoRa plays the role of continuously collecting data such as pH, oxidation
    reduction potential (ORP), electrical conductivity (EC), water temperature, air
    temperature, humidity, light intensity, and NPK. The AI is at the heart of the
    INNSA platform because it provides even more value to the IoT devices and enables
    the platform to comprehend the data it collected by IoT devices. In addition,
    with the use of AI, it also provides the ability to analyze market information,
    such as history coffee prices, to provide reports and predictive analysis for
    suppliers to adjust export plans. Besides, with deep learning-based technology,
    AI recognizes the images via camera to output advice about cultivation, harvest,
    pest, and disease prevention, etc. The data collected was sent back to the computer
    database for processing. This platform provides real-time information about the
    cultivating regions. Last but not least, that information, after being stored,
    analyzed in real time, and fed into the traceability system, helps increase transparency
    about the origin of the product, thereby adding the value of the product. 2.2
    Data Analysis and Collections for the INNSA Platform Big data collected by the
    INNSA platform was used to provide predictive insights in farming operations,
    drive real-time operational decisions, and redesign business processes for game-changing
    business models related to the coffee supply chain and value chain. Based on the
    quality assessment in the coffee supply chain and value chain, a standard quality
    certification for domestic use and export was developed to apply for the INNSA
    platform. In order to make the system smarter to make food production efficiently,
    machine learning algorithms (e.g., neural network, random forest, support vector
    machine, etc.) were used to build the big data analytic models. Firstly, powered
    by AI, the INNSA platform is capable of analyzing the collected data to make assessments
    and suggestions for farmers to make decisions of fertilizing products and irrigations.
    For example, based on weather data, humidity, temperature, and plant care regime
    for each time period, AI can suggest when to water, how much water, and what fertilizer
    according to the growth and development of the coffee tree over time. This helps
    reduce costs and increase coffee production. Besides, with the use of AI to analyze
    and diagnose pests based on images of leaves of coffee trees collected from surveillance
    cameras, the platform can automatically and early detect pests, thereby helping
    farmers not only choosing treatment solutions but also reducing costs when pests
    and diseases have not been spread on a large area. In addition, the IoT system
    combined with an automatically controlled irrigation and care system also helps
    to reduce material and labor costs. Secondly, the AI-based advanced analytics
    of the platform is also used to improve the efficiency of coffee storage, processing,
    and exporting operations. With the use of IoT devices in monitoring, the warehouse
    environment, coffee beans quality monitoring cameras, AI-powered advanced analysis
    INNSA platform uses collected IoT''s data to evaluate, guide, and decision support
    for managers. Moreover, the platform also provides predictive insights such as
    coffee quantity and quality based on coffee growing areas, predicts coffee price
    in the future, and forecasts the demand of the market. That information is analyzed
    and aggregated into final reports to assist suppliers in finding partners and
    estimating the volume of products to sign export contracts in accordance with
    their ability. Additionally, due to the digitization of coffee product related
    information, the INNSA platform is designed to be used not only as a coffee information
    portal but also as an advanced analysis portal of coffee beans quantity and quality
    of each region, each coffee growing area in Vietnam. Thereby helping the coffee
    industry of Vietnam to a higher level, well-recognized in terms of values, branding,
    and sustainability. Finally, the platform was developed based on cost-effective
    equipment and open-source software. This allows easy scaling and system development
    for responding to the actual needs of agriculture in the future. Blockchain-based
    supply chain traceability systems were developed by using radio frequency identification
    (RFID), a non-contact automatic identification communication technology [6] to
    trace products with trusted information in the entire supply chain, and by linking
    with IoT devices and integrating into the INNSA platform to provide digital data
    of production and consumption [5]. A sensor network system consisting of IoT devices
    and application programming interface (API) programmed by NodeJS and deployed
    in the server running Linux operating system (OS) were used to collect data [13].
    Data transmission sensor used a communication protocol type MQTT [14]. By using
    this protocol, the microcontroller and computers or mobile apps were communicated
    wirelessly. Data collection block diagram, including array sensors, connected
    to IoT sensor network, API, cloud, local database, visual modeling, and computation.
    The sensor data from the microcontroller was sent to the LoRaWAN gateway, thus
    the data could be sent to the cloud and stored in a local database. Sensor data
    stored on a local database was used for real-time visualization. To perform computational
    modeling, sensor data was accessed on a local database. 2.3 The Proposed Models
    for the INNSA Platform A solution architecture of the INNSA platform is designed
    as shown in Fig. 2, taking into account the following points: (1) critical investigation
    and reviews of the coffee supply chain and value chain in Vietnam; (2) innovative
    and cost-effective development of the platform with the smart database; (3) construction
    of big data for the platform, the real-world data inputs for a smart database;
    (4) innovative and cost-effective developments of value-added products and services
    in the value chain of the INNSA platform and ecosystems; and (5) systematic integration,
    evaluation, and analysis of the developed platform and products within the ecosystems.
    Fig. 2 Proposed models of the INNSA platform Full size image First of all, the
    data was collected from users, video/PDF files, and IoT systems, to store it in
    a database, called Data Lake. From Data Lake, data was analyzed on demand to create
    business intelligence software, called BI tools. Then, a portal was developed
    to connect and integrate websites and visitors. Mobile applications were also
    created to control IoT devices and recommend farming care procedures. Finally,
    AI and machine learning technologies were used to design, optimize, and predict
    models, from which results are generated via an API gateway. 2.4 A General Workflow
    of the INNSA Platform A general workflow of the INNSA platform was shown in Fig.
    3. In the first step, a critical investigation and reviews of the coffee supply
    chain and coffee value chain in Vietnam is performed on the whole supply chain,
    including production, collection, processing, commerce—import and export, and
    consumption, with the focus on (1) identification of the key factors and stakeholders
    in the coffee supply chain and coffee value chain in Vietnam, and (2) strength,
    weakness, opportunity, and threat (SWOT) analysis. Fig. 3 General workflow of
    the INNSA platform Full size image Based on the critical investigation and reviews
    from the first step, the INNSA platform is designed in the second step, with the
    focus on supply chain traceability systems, as well as management systems. The
    supply chain traceability system is presented in Fig. 4 with a detailed description.
    The management systems have key functions such as farm production area management,
    plant information management system (PIMS), supplier information management system
    (SIMS), and customer and partner relationship management (CRM and PRM). Besides,
    E-commerce systems (web and mobile applications), IoT devices using LoRa waves,
    and API Gateway systems integrated with blockchain and AI are also developed.
    Fig. 4 Detailed workflow of the supply chain traceability system within the INNSA
    platform Full size image In the third step, the construction of big data for the
    INNSA platform is successfully designed and developed. The INNSA platform with
    the designed smart database needs the real-world data inputs, especially the ones
    that can be directly used for smart farming’s applications: farm soils and environmental
    conditions (moisture levels and weather in different times of the year), as well
    as the latest information about the crops and market trends from all connected
    sources. Big data collected by the INNSA platform are being developed to provide
    predictive insights in farming operations, drive real-time operational decisions,
    and redesign business processes for game-changing business models related to the
    coffee supply chain and coffee value chain in Vietnam. We seek and contract reputable
    partners in Vietnam and abroad to provide high quality input supply for coffee
    production as well as products and equipment for each key stakeholder. Information
    of these partners is added to the information portal systems. In addition, the
    platform also provides a quality assessment function of these partners. Based
    on this assessment, the platform will give priority to introducing reputable and
    quality partners to participate in the coffee supply chain and value chain. Based
    on the quality assessment in the coffee supply chain and value chain, a standard
    quality certification for domestic use and export such as UTZ and C4 assessment
    will be developed to apply for the platform. In the fourth step, innovative and
    cost-effective developments of value-added products and services in the coffee
    value chain are added to the INNSA platform and its ecosystems, including: (1)
    products made from coffee beans and wastes, (2) products for sustainable and precision
    agriculture: microbial organic fertilizer for coffee plants; (3) smart devices
    and IoT solutions for continuous and automatic updates of data and information
    to construct big data for the INNSA platform; and (4) E-commerce and commercialization
    of coffee beans and coffee products, with the support of AI, blockchain and supply
    chain traceability technologies. Finally, systematic integration, evaluation,
    and analysis of the developed INNSA platform and products within the INNSA ecosystems
    are designed and implemented. All products, modules, and data resulting from the
    third and fourth steps are integrated into the INNSA platform developed in the
    second step for evaluation and analysis, and related risk and security assessment,
    quality control, and management issues. The evaluation and analysis are based
    on the real-world business models and data, at the laboratory scale first, and
    then in coffee farms and coffee storage spaces. A farm of 500 m2 of White Lion
    JSC (Iced Coffee) in Mdrak district, Daklak province, Vietnam was used for demonstration,
    analysis, and evaluation, with the focus on how the system collect and process
    data to support smart farming, harvest and post-harvest processing, storage, source
    traceability, commercialization, as well as related issues in the coffee supply
    chain and value chain. Finally, the principles of LEAN Industry 4.0 and Sustainable
    Developments [16] are introduced and applied in management and operations of the
    INNSA platform, as well as when developing value-added products and services in
    the value chain of the INNSA platform and its related ecosystems, including the
    hardware, software, smart devices, e-commerce platform, and innovative products
    from coffee trees, beans, and wastes. For future works, the INNSA platform can
    be applied to other agricultural supply chains such as marine culture and shrimp
    farming for a sustainable aquaculture [17, 18]. 3 Summary and Conclusions Under
    the impacts of Industry 4.0 and UN’s sustainable development goals, it is necessary
    to develop an innovative and smart agriculture platform that can be effectively
    used for the creation and operation of a sustainable coffee value chain, to enhance
    the quality and create added values for key elements of the coffee supply chain.
    In this paper, the INNSA platform is introduced, to provide the information portal
    and open-access database for all key factors of coffee supply chain, enabling
    them to join and interact with each other effectively and systematically, with
    the focus on the case of the coffee industry of Vietnam, aimed at enhancement
    of the values, branding and sustainability of the coffee value chain and supply
    chain in Vietnam. The platform is designed based on the foundations of the key
    enabling digital transformation and smart agriculture technologies, with the following
    key features: A smart database with real-time data inputs and updates, cost-effectiveness,
    and open-architectures for effective integrations of the enabling digital transformation
    and smart agriculture technologies. The successful development of the INNSA platform
    will potentially create the significance and impacts in the coffee supply chain,
    and to directly contribute to the United Nations Sustainable Goals. It also directly
    contributes to Vietnam''s Smart Agriculture and Industry 4.0, successful development,
    and applications of the key enabling technologies of digital transformation and
    smart agriculture, including the following ones: smart devices and IoT, big data,
    AI, blockchain and source traceability technologies, and sustainable design and
    manufacturing. It is expected that, for the first time in Vietnam, there is the
    smart platform and ecosystem as the information portal and open-access database
    for farmers, traders, processing companies, import and export companies, retail
    shops, and coffee users, can join to obtain and share information, as well as
    to commercialize coffee products, to specifically meet their needs in both the
    coffee supply chain and coffee value chain. References Abideen, A. Z., Sundram,

  description: The adoption of Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) technologies has
    revolutionized agricultural practices worldwide. However, their application in
    the context of sub-Saharan Africa remains a critical challenge. This study presents
    a systematic review that investigates the potential of 4IR technologies in smart
    irrigation. Sub-Saharan Africa faces multiple agricultural challenges, exacerbated
    by climate change, water scarcity, and inefficient irrigation practices. The need
    for sustainable, water-efficient, and data-driven irrigation systems is urgent
    to ensure food security and economic development in the region. This study addresses
    a crucial knowledge gap by assessing the constraints, opportunities, and prospects
    of implementing 4IR technologies for smart irrigation in sub-Saharan Africa. A
    systematic review methodology was employed, utilizing reputable databases including
    Web of Science, Google Scholar, Science Direct, Institute of Electrical and Electronics
    Engineers (IEEE) Xplore, and PubMed. A comprehensive search strategy was designed
    to identify peer-reviewed articles, conference papers, and reports related to
    the application of Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, Unmanned Aerial
    Vehicles, Big Data, and Blockchain technology in smart irrigation. The Preferred
    Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) approach was
    used to arrive at 95 articles included in this research. The review reveals promising
    trends in the integration of 4IR technologies for smart irrigation. 4IR technologies
    including Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things, Big Data technology, Blockchain
    and drones are widely used in smart irrigation. These technologies have facilitated
    real time monitoring of soil moisture and weather conditions, precision irrigation
    scheduling, water allocation optimization, rapid data collection, insights in
    real time crop water use and transparency and trust in agricultural water management
    among others. While the potential of 4IR technologies is evident, challenges including
    limited infrastructure, access to technology, and technical expertise pose significant
    barriers for the adoption in sub-Saharan Africa. Additionally, the high initial
    costs associated with these technologies can impede widespread adoption. The study
    highlights the potential to leverage existing mobile phone penetration for IoT
    data collection, collaborative partnerships, and innovative financing models to
    overcome financial constraints. Capacity-building initiatives and knowledge transfer
    can empower local communities to embrace these technologies. The future of smart
    irrigation in sub-Saharan Africa relies on policy support, investments, and technology
    diffusion strategies. It is imperative to create an enabling environment that
    fosters innovation and addresses the unique needs of the region. Collaboration
    between governments, academia, industry, and international organizations can catalyze
    the transformative impact of 4IR technologies, ultimately enhancing irrigation

    Learning Introduction Sub-Saharan Africa is a region whose agriculture is heavily
    reliant on unpredictable rainfall. According to the FAO, the total area of land
    under irrigation in sub-Saharan Africa was estimated at 7 million hectares in
    2020, representing only 5 % of the region''s arable land [1], [2], [3]. Globally
    freshwater resources are limited and unevenly distributed, with many regions experiencing
    physical and economic water scarcity (UN [4]). Despite the ongoing challenges
    related to water scarcity, there are global developments in irrigation that hold
    promise for enhancing agricultural productivity and building resilience against
    the impacts of climate change [[5], [6], [7], [8],4]. The world is currently witnessing
    the fourth industrial revolution, characterized by the integration of emerging
    technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Blockchain, the Internet of
    Things (IoT), Big Data Technology, Drones, Robots and 3D printing [9,10]. The
    use of these modern intelligent technologies in irrigation is emerging in sub-Saharan
    Africa and is set to transform farming by allowing smart and precise irrigation
    [11,12]. For instance, IoT sensors can be used to monitor soil moisture levels
    and automatically adjust irrigation to optimize water use efficiency, whereas
    AI applications can predict weather patterns and optimize irrigation scheduling.
    To enhance water-use efficiency and contribute to Sustainable Development Goals
    (SDGs), particularly Goal 6 and Target 6.4, it is essential to implement innovation
    in irrigation systems. As such, there is a need for increased investment in irrigation
    infrastructure and adoption of modern intelligent technologies to ensure sustainable
    irrigation practices in sub-Saharan Africa. The importance of smart irrigation
    cannot be overstated in today''s world, where climate change is affecting global
    freshwater resources and increasing water scarcity. Manual irrigation of crops
    is not only time-consuming but also inefficient, while irrigation based on fixed
    timers does not account for changes in weather or soil conditions that affect
    moisture levels [13], [14], [15], [16], [17]. Smart irrigation systems take into
    account weather and soil conditions to optimize irrigation, resulting in significant
    water savings of up to 30 percent [18], [19], [20], [21]. As a result, smart irrigation
    has emerged as a more effective and sustainable approach in irrigated agriculture.
    The essence of smart irrigation lies in its conceptual framework, which amalgamates
    technology and agricultural practices to optimize water use efficiency. This framework
    revolves around several key components. Sensors and monitoring systems, ranging
    from soil moisture sensors to weather instruments, gather real-time data on variables
    critical to irrigation decisions. This data is then subjected to analysis using
    cutting-edge approaches like artificial intelligence and machine learning models,
    providing insights that inform irrigation scheduling, water allocation, and crop
    management. The actual irrigation is optimized through precision delivery mechanisms
    like drip irrigation, which directs water directly to plant root zones, minimizing
    losses through evaporation and runoff [22]. Automation and control mechanisms
    enable real-time adjustments based on collected data, enhancing the efficiency
    of irrigation practices. The integration of these components is facilitated by
    the connectivity and communication capabilities of the IoT, enabling seamless
    data exchange, remote monitoring, and control of irrigation systems [13]. Central
    to the smart irrigation discourse is the concept of Water Use Efficiency (WUE)
    in agriculture. WUE measures the ratio of agricultural output to the amount of
    water used for productively by the plant [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28]. Smart
    irrigation systems have the potential to enhance WUE significantly by tailoring
    irrigation schedules to crop water requirements [29,30,23,31,[24], [25], [26],
    [27], [28]]. Leveraging real-time data on factors like soil moisture, weather
    conditions, and plant stress, these systems enable precise irrigation, optimizing
    both water use and crop growth. The incorporation of 4IR technologies further
    enhances WUE by enabling accurate predictions of water demand. AI algorithms analyze
    historical data and environmental factors to forecast crop water needs, ensuring
    timely irrigation application. This predictive ability, combined with real-time
    weather monitoring, empowers farmers to adapt irrigation schedules proactively,
    thus optimizing water use efficiency. Despite various studies investigating irrigation
    technologies and practices, a significant research gap persists regarding the
    effective integration of 4IR technologies into smart irrigation systems. Recent
    systematic literature reviews have focused on the applications of 4IR in other
    domains like manufacturing, health, transport, fashion, labor force among others
    [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37], [38], [39], [40], [41], [42], [43]. Therefore,
    the primary objective of this systematic review paper was to examine the role
    of 4IR technologies in smart irrigation and their potential applications in the
    context of sub-Saharan Africa. Specifically, the review aimed to: a) explore the
    utilization of AI in irrigation systems for precision irrigation, water demand
    prediction, crop yield estimation, and soil moisture management; b) investigate
    the role of IoT and Drone Technology in generating and managing data for improved
    irrigation management practices; c) examine the potential applications of Blockchain
    and Machine Learning in irrigation, particularly in data management and decision-making
    processes; and d) identify the constraints, challenges, and opportunities associated
    with leveraging 4IR technologies in smart irrigation within the context of sub-Saharan
    Africa. This paper provides insights for researchers, decision-makers, and practitioners
    interested in enhancing the efficiency and sustainability of irrigation practices
    in sub-Saharan Africa. Research methodology A systematic review approach was used

    regarding industrial revolution The Industrial Revolution marked a significant
    turning point in human history, propelling societies into an era of unprecedented
    technological advancements. Throughout the various stages of the Industrial Revolution,
    irrigation technology played a crucial role in enhancing agricultural productivity
    and sustaining growing populations. In this section, we explored the evolution
    of irrigation technology from the Industrial Revolution 1.0 to 4.0 and the timelines,
    showcasing the remarkable advancements that revolutionized the way water was harnessed
    and distributed for agricultural purposes. The first Industrial Revolution, starting
    in the late 18th century, witnessed the emergence of steam power as a primary
    driving force [47]. This technological breakthrough led to advancements in irrigation
    systems. Steam-powered pumps and engines were introduced [48], enabling the lifting
    of water from rivers and reservoirs to higher elevations. Canal systems were developed
    to transport water efficiently across vast distances, promoting agricultural expansion
    and increasing crop yields [49]. The second Industrial Revolution, characterized
    by the widespread adoption of electricity and mass production techniques [50],
    had a profound impact on irrigation technology. Electrical pumps and motors replaced
    steam-powered machinery, providing more reliable and efficient water delivery.
    Farmers gained greater control over irrigation schedules, leading to improved
    water management, and increased agricultural output [51]. Electric-powered sprinkler
    systems and drip irrigation methods were introduced, optimizing water distribution,
    and minimizing waste. With the advent of the third Industrial Revolution, automation
    and computerization revolutionized irrigation technology [52]. The integration
    of sensors, data analytics, and computer systems into irrigation infrastructure
    enabled precise monitoring and control of water usage. Automated irrigation systems
    adjusted water flow based on soil moisture levels, weather conditions, and plant
    requirements, ensuring optimal irrigation while conserving water resources. This
    era witnessed the emergence of smart irrigation technologies, empowering farmers
    with real-time data and insights for efficient decision-making [53]. The ongoing
    fourth Industrial Revolution, characterized by digitalization and the IoT [54],
    is transforming irrigation technology in unprecedented ways. Advanced sensor networks,
    drones, and satellite imagery are utilized to monitor soil conditions, water availability,
    and plant health with exceptional precision. Machine learning algorithms analyze
    vast amounts of data, providing predictive insights to optimize irrigation strategies
    and maximize crop productivity. Smart irrigation systems, integrated with AI-driven
    controllers, remotely manage water distribution, reducing water waste and enabling
    sustainable agricultural practices. Fig. 5 summarizes the remarkable industrial
    revolution with the different technologies. Download : Download high-res image

    [54]. Fourth industrial revolution technologies for smart irrigation In 2011,
    the German government unveiled a novel concept known as \"Industry 4.0″ during
    a trade fair. This initiative primarily aims to enhance collaboration among individuals,
    machinery, and resources [55]. At its core, Industry 4.0 revolves around the idea
    of bridging the gap between the physical and virtual realms [56]. It establishes
    connections among machines, functions, and systems through intelligent networks
    that span the entire value chain, allowing them to operate autonomously and interact
    with one another [57]. The term \"Industry 4.0″ refers to both partially and fully
    automated advanced manufacturing processes driven by technology, where equipment
    can communicate independently throughout the value chain [56]. This innovative
    concept encompasses various technologies such as digital manufacturing, network
    communication, computing, and automation, all integrated within the adaptable
    and intricate systems of Industry 4.0. The application of Fourth Industrial Revolution
    technologies in irrigation (Fig. 6) represents a significant leap forward in modern
    agriculture. This transformative era is marked by the convergence of digital,
    physical, and biological systems, and it brings with it a multitude of innovative
    tools and techniques that enhance irrigation practices. One of the key pillars
    of this revolution is the IoT, which involves embedding sensors and devices in
    irrigation systems to collect real-time data on soil moisture levels, weather
    conditions, and crop health. AI and machine learning algorithms then process this
    data to make precise and timely decisions regarding irrigation scheduling, optimizing
    water usage, and minimizing waste. Furthermore, drones equipped with advanced
    imaging technology are employed for aerial monitoring of fields, providing farmers
    with a comprehensive view of their crops and irrigation needs. Additionally, blockchain
    technology is being utilized to create transparent and secure systems for water
    resource management and supply chain tracking, ensuring the efficient distribution
    of water resources. These 4IR technologies collectively empower farmers with unprecedented
    control and insights into their irrigation practices, ultimately contributing
    to increased crop yields, resource conservation, and sustainable agricultural
    practices in an era of global environmental challenges. Download : Download high-res

    for smart irrigation. Artificial intelligence in smart irrigation AI refers to
    the ability of machines to learn and make decisions based on data [58]. AI plays
    a pivotal role in smart irrigation systems, enabling advanced analytics and decision-making
    capabilities [59]. AI algorithms can be used to analyze data on weather, soil
    moisture, and crop water requirements and to make automated decisions on irrigation
    scheduling [60]. This can improve the accuracy and efficiency of irrigation management
    and reduce the risk of over- or under-irrigation. AI enables farmers to collect,
    analyze, and interpret data on a large scale, allowing for more precise and accurate
    irrigation decisions [61]. AI can analyze large amounts of data and provide insights
    that can be used to optimize irrigation. For example, AI can analyze data on soil
    moisture levels, temperature, humidity, and crop growth patterns to identify the
    most efficient irrigation strategies for specific crops and soil types. Fig. 7

    image Fig. 7. Integration of AI in Smart Irrigation. Predictive modelling for
    water demand and crop yield AI-based predictive models for example neural networks,
    ensemble, regression, classification, and time series forecasting models are utilized
    to forecast water demand and crop yield based on historical data and environmental
    factors (Kuradusenge et al., 2023; [45]). Such models use historical data, weather
    patterns, and crop-specific information to estimate the irrigation requirements,
    facilitating efficient water allocation. Kuradusenge et al. (2023) used rainfall
    and temperature data analyzed through Random Forest, Polynomial Regression, and
    Support Vector Regressor to predict crop yield of Irish potato and maize. Random
    forest was recommended for early crop yield prediction of potatoes and maize (Kuradusenge
    et al., 2023). AI algorithms are employed to analyze real-time data from soil
    moisture sensors and determine the optimal irrigation timing and volume [62].
    By continuously monitoring soil moisture levels, smart irrigation systems can
    ensure that crops receive adequate water while avoiding waterlogging and excessive
    runoff [63]. One example of the application of soil moisture monitoring and management
    in sub-Saharan Africa is a study done by (Wanyama et al., 2023). The authors have
    developed a cost-effective green technology intelligent irrigation control system
    kit that improves precise irrigation water application. This kit is a photovoltaic
    system that powers a water pump, a soil moisture sensor, and an Arduino microcontroller
    unit mounted on a moving frame. The soil moisture sensors were placed in the field
    and sent real-time soil moisture values to the microcontroller via a wired Universal
    Serial Bus (USB) communication channel. The microcontroller connected the water
    pump, the tank water level sensor, the soil moisture sensors, and the water tank
    outlet solenoid valve. Therefore, the system could schedule irrigation thus improving
    the traditional irrigation technology. Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are employed
    in smart irrigation systems to analyze data patterns, make predictions, and optimize
    irrigation [64], [65], [66], [67]. ML algorithms learn from historical and real-time
    data, enabling adaptive decision-making and improving irrigation efficiency [68].
    Machine Learning algorithms can analyze historical data on weather, soil conditions,
    and crop performance to predict future irrigation requirements [62]. By providing
    accurate forecasts, ML-based predictive analytics support farmers in making informed
    decisions regarding irrigation scheduling, water allocation, and crop management.
    ML algorithms can be utilized to develop adaptive irrigation control systems that
    adjust irrigation parameters based on real-time data inputs [69,70]. These systems
    continuously monitor soil moisture levels, weather conditions, and plant water
    stress, allowing for dynamic irrigation control to optimize water use efficiency
    and crop productivity. The synergy between AI and smart irrigation is transformative,
    offering data-driven insights and automation for efficient water management. AI
    processes copious data from sensors, weather forecasts, and soil conditions to
    optimize irrigation schedules. ML models are trained on historical data and environmental
    cues to predict crop water requirements. Table 3 summarizes other applications
    using AI in irrigation operations. In another study, Ikudayisi et al. [71] conducted
    research focused on managing crop water requirements at the Winterton irrigation
    scheme in South Africa, aiming to address the challenges posed by water scarcity
    and its impact on agricultural efficiency. To achieve their objectives, the researchers
    employed a combined approach involving artificial intelligence, namely an artificial
    neural network (ANN), and a crop growth simulation model. The study aimed to estimate
    various aspects of crop irrigation water requirements, including the crop-water
    demand from planting to harvest, the timing of irrigation, the optimal stage in
    the drying cycle for water application, and the volume of irrigation water to
    be applied. Five feed-forward backward propagation ANN predictive models with
    varying configurations were developed and assessed. The optimal ANN model, characterized
    by 5 inputs, 5 neurons, 1 hidden layer, and 1 output, was employed to predict
    monthly reference evapotranspiration (ETo) in the Winterton region. This optimal
    ANN model demonstrated a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.67, a Pearson correlation
    coefficient (r) of 0.97, and a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.94. The
    validation of the model revealed a correlation (r) value of 0.9048 between the
    measured and predicted ETo values. Table 3 summarizes other applications using
    AI in irrigation operations. Table 2 Table 2. Artificial intelligence applications

    Things in smart irrigation IoT refers to the network of devices, sensors, and
    machines that are connected to the internet and can exchange data with each other
    [77]. In smart irrigation systems, IoT devices such as sensors and controllers
    can be used to collect and transmit data on weather, soil moisture, and crop water
    requirements. This data can be processed and analyzed in real-time to adjust irrigation
    schedules and optimize water use. IoT plays a crucial role in collecting and transmitting
    data in smart irrigation systems [78,79]. IoT sensors and devices are deployed
    throughout the irrigation infrastructure to monitor various parameters and facilitate
    data-driven decision-making. connectivity. In IoT applications, connectivity between
    gateways, remote clouds, and users is typically over broadband communication networks.
    However, in most of sub-Saharan Africa''s rural countries, broadband connectivity
    is either very expensive or non-existent. Affordable broadband technologies like
    TVWS have been tested in South Africa and around the world and can provide both
    backhaul and last-mile wireless connectivity for remotely deployed agricultural
    IoT-based systems in various locations [80] Data generation and collection through
    IoT sensors IoT sensors, such as soil moisture sensors, weather stations, and
    flow meters, collect real-time data on soil moisture, temperature, humidity, rainfall,
    and water flow [81,82]. These sensors provide a continuous stream of information,
    enabling farmers to make informed decisions regarding irrigation management. Nigussie
    et al. (2020) proposed an IoT-based irrigation management system for smallholder
    farmers in South Africa, Kenya, and Ethiopia`s rural areas. Sensors in the system
    detect soil conditions (moisture, temperature, nutrients, and pH) and provide
    data on the water level in the storage as well as microclimate conditions. The
    actuators in this system direct the flow of water to the farm via sprinklers,
    pumps, valves, and water gates. The IoT network connectivity technology used in
    this system was Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN). This is because LoRaWAN
    is a fully open standard solution with no subscription fee, making it less expensive
    for IoT connectivity devices, and it is well-suited for long-distance. Cloud computing
    for data management and analysis Cloud computing has emerged as a revolutionary
    technology that can transform the way we manage and optimize irrigation systems.
    Cloud computing platforms are utilized to store and process the vast amount of
    data generated by IoT sensors in smart irrigation systems [83]. Cloud-based solutions
    provide scalable storage, computational power, and data analytics capabilities,
    allowing for efficient data management and analysis, [84]. One of the key benefits
    of cloud computing in smart irrigation is the ability to store and process large
    amounts of data in a centralized location. This allows farmers to easily access
    and analyze data on things like soil moisture levels, weather patterns, and crop
    health, which can help them make more informed decisions about irrigation. With
    data driven irrigation optimization, farmers can reduce water waste and ensure
    that water is used only when and where it is needed, leading to improved water
    use efficiency. In sub-Saharan Africa, cloud services create additional running
    costs for irrigation management systems. To address these issues, the most commonly
    proposed IoT architectures typically provide local processing and storage in gateways
    created for data processing, network management, irrigation decisions, and communication
    with farmers. This avoids the need for broadband networks and cloud services (backend
    servers) [80]. Maitethia et al. [85] executed a groundbreaking IoT smart irrigation
    system in Kenya, setting a remarkable precedent for precision agriculture in Africa.
    By integrating a network of sensors, weather stations, and cloud-based analytics,
    their pioneering initiative ushered in a new era of data-driven irrigation management.
    The remarkable outcomes encompassed substantial crop yield improvements, significant
    water conservation, substantial cost reductions, and enhanced climate resilience,
    ultimately bolstering food security and elevating the socioeconomic status of
    local farmers. Although initial investments and the need for comprehensive technical
    training posed initial challenges, the unparalleled potential of IoT-driven smart
    irrigation holds the promise of fostering a sustainable and prosperous future
    for African agriculture. Table 4 presents other applications of IoT in irrigation.
    Big data technology in smart irrigation Big Data Technology plays a significant
    role in unlocking the potential of data in smart irrigation systems [94]. By harnessing
    large volumes of data, valuable insights can be gained to optimize irrigation
    management practices. Big data analytics involves the use of advanced analytical
    techniques to extract insights from large and complex datasets. In smart irrigation
    systems, big data analytics can be used to analyze data on weather, soil moisture,
    and crop water requirements and to identify patterns and trends that can inform
    irrigation management. Big data refers to large and complex data sets that cannot
    be processed using traditional data processing techniques. In the context of precision
    irrigation, big data can be used to analyze large volumes of data on weather patterns,
    soil moisture levels, crop water requirements, and other factors that affect irrigation
    needs. Big Data analytics techniques are applied to historical and real-time data
    to identify patterns, trends, and correlations related to irrigation and crop
    performance [95]. This enables farmers to make data-driven decisions regarding
    irrigation scheduling, water allocation, and crop management. Rabhi et al. [96]
    explored the application of big data analytics in the context of smart irrigation,
    with a specific focus on digital agriculture in Morocco. Their research aimed
    to leverage big data analytics to enhance predictive irrigation techniques. They
    noted the growing importance of intelligent agriculture, characterized by widespread
    adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) analysis solutions, which has led to more
    precise irrigation scheduling. The research took place utilizing an irrigation
    dataset that considered moisture and temperature factors. To analyze this dataset,
    the authors employed neural network (NN) and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms.
    The computational aspect of their study was conducted using the big data platform
    \"databricks,\" which implements the Spark framework for processing large datasets.
    The results from their models were promising, with SVM achieving an accuracy of
    97.00 % and NN reaching an accuracy of 98.50 %. In their future work, the authors
    intend to expand upon the 19,440 enterprise metamodel, introducing additional
    constructs related to advanced technologies such as big data analytics tools,
    IoT, AI, cloud computing, and machine learning. This extended metamodel is envisioned
    to be applied in the context of a smart farm, aligning with the principles of
    Agriculture 4.0. The use of Big Data in smart irrigation systems raises concerns
    about data privacy and security [97]. Safeguarding sensitive information and ensuring
    secure data transmission and storage are essential to maintain trust and protect
    the integrity of smart irrigation systems. Blockchain technology for managing
    big data in irrigation Blockchain technology offers a decentralized and transparent
    framework for managing and securing data in smart irrigation systems [95]. It
    provides an immutable ledger that records and verifies data transactions, ensuring
    data integrity and enabling trusted collaborations. Blockchain technology offers
    a decentralized and transparent framework for managing and securing data in smart
    irrigation systems [98]. By leveraging Blockchain, data can be stored and managed
    in a distributed manner across multiple nodes, eliminating the need for a central
    authority [99]. In smart irrigation, Blockchain can provide an immutable ledger
    that records and verifies data transactions related to water usage, irrigation
    practices, and resource management. Each data transaction is cryptographically
    linked to the previous transaction, creating a chain of blocks that ensures data
    integrity and transparency. By utilizing Blockchain for data management, smart
    irrigation systems can enhance trust and accountability in water governance [100].
    All stakeholders, including farmers, water authorities, and researchers, can access
    and verify the data recorded on the Blockchain, enabling transparent and auditable
    irrigation practices. The decentralized nature of Blockchain also mitigates the
    risks of data tampering and unauthorized modifications. Since data is stored across
    multiple nodes in the network, any attempt to alter the data would require consensus
    from a majority of nodes, making it highly secure and resistant to fraud or manipulation
    [101,102]. Moreover, Blockchain can facilitate trusted collaborations and data
    sharing among stakeholders in the irrigation ecosystem. Smart contracts, which
    are self-executing agreements coded on the Blockchain, can automate and enforce
    rules and conditions related to water allocation, usage rights, and payment systems
    [103]. These smart contracts enhance transparency and efficiency in irrigation
    governance, reducing the reliance on intermediaries and streamlining administrative
    processes. However, the adoption of Blockchain in smart irrigation systems comes
    with challenges. The scalability and energy consumption of Blockchain networks,
    especially in resource-constrained environments, need to be addressed. Additionally,
    ensuring data privacy while maintaining transparency is crucial, as sensitive
    information may be recorded on the Blockchain. Despite these challenges, Blockchain
    technology shows promising potential in revolutionizing data management and governance
    in smart irrigation systems. Further research and pilot projects are needed to
    explore the practical implementation and scalability of Blockchain solutions in
    the context of sub-Saharan Africa. Blockchain''s smart contract functionality
    can be leveraged to automate and enforce irrigation governance rules [104]. Smart
    contracts enable the execution of predefined rules and conditions related to water
    allocation, usage rights, and payment systems. This enhances transparency, reduces
    disputes, and ensures fair and accountable irrigation practices. Drone technology
    in smart irrigation Drone technology has emerged as a promising tool for enhancing
    smart irrigation practices in various agricultural contexts. Drones, also known
    as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), offer unique capabilities for remote sensing,
    high-resolution data collection, and precision irrigation management. Drones equipped
    with advanced sensors and imaging systems enable remote sensing and high-resolution
    data collection in agricultural landscapes [105,103,106]. These sensors capture
    data on various parameters, including soil moisture, vegetation indices, temperature,
    and crop health. The collected data provides valuable insights into the spatial
    variability of soil and crop conditions, allowing for targeted irrigation interventions.
    In Kenya, certain farmers have embraced innovative approaches such as employing
    near-infrared cameras affixed to drones for pest and disease identification, among
    other applications. Additionally, within the Kenyan context, there exists a beta-stage
    AI tool named Nuru, accessible on Android devices with or without internet connectivity
    [107]. This advanced technology specializes in the diagnosis of crop diseases,
    with a particular focus on identifying mite and viral infections in cassava and
    detecting armyworm infestations in maize. KDHI Agriculture reports that a substantial
    number of cassava farmers, approximately 28,000, have already reaped the benefits
    of this tool''s implementation. One of the key applications of drone technology
    in smart irrigation is the monitoring of soil moisture levels [108]. Drones equipped
    with specialized sensors can capture near infrared and thermal imagery to assess
    soil moisture content across fields. This information helps farmers understand

  description: Addressing the critical challenges of resource inefficiency and environmental
    impact in the agrifood sector, this study explores the integration of Internet
    of Things (IoT) technologies with IOTA’s Tangle, a Distributed Ledger Technology
    (DLT). This integration aims to enhance sustainable agricultural practices, using
    rice cultivation as a case study of high relevance and reapplicability given its
    importance in the food chain and the high irrigation requirement of its cultivation.
    The approach employs sensor-based intelligent irrigation systems to optimize water
    efficiency. These systems enable real-time monitoring of agricultural parameters
    through IoT sensors. Data management is facilitated by IOTA’s Tangle, providing
    secure and efficient data handling, and integrated with MongoDB, a Database Management
    System (DBMS), for effective data storage and retrieval. The collaboration between
    IoT and IOTA led to significant reductions in resource consumption. Implementing
    sustainable agricultural practices resulted in a 50% reduction in water usage,
    25% decrease in nitrogen consumption, and a 50% to 70% reduction in methane emissions.
    Additionally, the system contributed to lower electricity consumption for irrigation
    pumps and generated comprehensive historical water depth records, aiding future
    resource management decisions. This study concludes that the integration of IoT
    with IOTA’s Tangle presents a highly promising solution for advancing sustainable
    agriculture. This approach significantly contributes to environmental conservation
    and food security. Furthermore, it establishes that DLTs like IOTA are not only
    viable but also effective for real-time monitoring and implementation of sustainable
    agricultural practices.

    data recording; environmental footprint 1. Introduction The agrifood sector, a
    cornerstone of the global economy, sustains billions by providing food and livelihoods.
    Yet, it grapples with multifaceted challenges, from climate change and environmental
    degradation to population growth, food security, and consumer trust. Addressing
    these requires sustainable, efficient agricultural practices that optimize resource
    use, curtail waste, and elevate productivity and quality. The Internet of Things
    (IoT) is emerging at the forefront of solutions. This network of interconnected
    devices, equipped with sensors, actuators, and communication protocols, offers
    real-time monitoring and control over parameters like crop growth, soil health,
    water consumption, pest management, and greenhouse gas emissions. Beyond monitoring,
    IoT enhances traceability and transparency throughout the food supply chain, bolstering
    food safety and consumer trust. However, the integration of IoT in agriculture
    is not without challenges, especially concerning data management: Data Security:
    Ensuring data integrity and safeguarding against malicious tampering is paramount.
    Data Privacy: Stakeholders’ rights and preferences necessitate stringent measures
    against unauthorized data access or disclosure. Data Scalability: As farms grow
    and technology adoption surges, systems must accommodate an increasing influx
    of data from sensors and devices. Data Interoperability: Seamless data exchange
    is crucial, especially when devices and systems employ diverse formats and standards.
    Data Cost: Efficient data transmission and storage are vital, particularly for
    frequent or low-value transactions. Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) and
    the IoT can address these challenges by offering a decentralized, immutable, and
    transparent platform for data management. However, while the blockchain, i.e.,
    the most widely used form of DLT, has revolutionized data storage through cryptographically
    linked blocks, it is necessary to address scalability, transaction fees, energy
    consumption, and more limitations in the data-intensive IoT universe. IOTA offers
    a fresh perspective on DLT with its Tangle, a directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure.
    Unlike blockchains, the Tangle permits feeless transactions, validated by nodes
    as they initiate new transactions [1,2]. This structure provides enhanced scalability,
    reduced energy consumption, quantum resistance, and the capability for offline
    transactions and microtransactions. Rather than replacing traditional blockchain
    systems, IOTA complements them, especially for the high-frequency data transactions
    inherent to the IoT. With projections indicating that, by 2030, approximately
    125 billion IoT devices will be interconnected [3], the sheer volume of data generated
    necessitates robust management, distribution, and storage solutions. While DLT
    offers a promising avenue, our study narrows its focus on IOTA’s Tangle, a DLT
    uniquely equipped to handle the vast data streams from IoT devices, given its
    scalable, fast, and feeless micro-data transaction capabilities. With this backdrop,
    our central research inquiry is both theoretical and pragmatic: Is it possible
    to devise a web application that seamlessly integrates Tangle IOTA with IoT-enabled
    sensors? These sensors, designed for monitoring sustainability metrics in agriculture,
    would empower operators in the agrifood sector with real-time insights, enabling
    timely interventions. To explore this, we have embarked on a Proof-of-Concept
    test focusing on data from rice cultivation. Our Proof-of-Concept focuses on rice
    cultivation, chosen due to its significant freshwater usage, which is the highest
    among all crops. Additionally, rice’s global prevalence and status as the world’s
    primary food crop make it a pertinent subject for our study [4]. We developed
    an analytical dashboard to demonstrate that using technologies such as IoT and
    IOTA optimizes product quality, product processing efficiency, cost, and production
    time. In summary, when we fully control production with devices and sensors (IoT),
    receiving data even from remote locations with the support of IOTA, it is possible
    to reduce the release of CO 2 by having control over irrigation and the right
    portion of water (more water equals more CO 2 and more waste). In addition, it
    is possible to track the product 24 h a day, receiving recorded data on IOTA almost
    through streaming. Finally, the process is very green, reducing electricity consumption.
    2. Background and Related Works In this section, we first provide a general background
    on distributed ledger technology (DLT), including both blockchains and tangles
    like IOTA. Then, we discuss related work on (i) traditional monitoring systems
    in agriculture, (ii) the use of the blockchain applied to agriculture, and (iii)
    the use of IOTA Tangle technology applied to agriculture. 2.1. Background DLT
    has become a transformative force in information technology, reshaping organizational
    collaboration and operation [5,6]. It employs a ledger system where multiple nodes
    can read and write data, maintaining a state based on consensus, which varies
    with the network’s decentralization level. DLTs are characterized mainly by their
    ledger structure: chain-based systems like blockchain and DAG-based systems like
    IOTA’s Tangle. Chain-based DLTs utilize a linear series of blocks, securing records
    through cryptographic hashing and consensus mechanisms like proof of work or stake.
    These blockchains differ in their access protocols and validator addition methods,
    affecting interaction levels with network components. In contrast, DAG-based DLTs
    allow parallel transaction processing, offering potentially higher scalability
    than chain-based systems. With independent transaction confirmation and no need
    for a single global consensus, DAG structures provide a more dynamic and scalable
    consensus approach. This contrasts with chain-based systems, where all transactions
    require network-wide confirmation, leading to potential bottlenecks in transaction
    processing and scalability. 2.2. Related Work 2.2.1. Traditional Monitoring Systems
    in Agriculture Historically, agricultural monitoring has evolved through various
    traditional systems. Key studies in this field have explored different approaches:
    Wang et al. developed a low-cost, real-time remote environmental monitoring system
    combining wireless equipment and mobile phones that was powered by solar energy.
    This system was effective in collecting real-time information and fulfilling online
    acquisition needs [7]. Dan et al. implemented a Greenhouse Environment Monitoring
    System using ZigBee technology, wireless sensors, and control nodes. This system
    focused on controlling environmental data for enhanced greenhouse management [8].
    Hashim et al. reviewed using an Arduino device for temperature and soil moisture
    control, managed via an Android smartphone. This study contributed to designing
    smart monitoring systems using an embedded micro-web server and IP connectivity,
    aiming to aid the agriculture sector in achieving quality production [9]. Karim
    et al. developed an application for precision farming based on a wireless sensor
    network and IoT cloud. This application focused on optimizing irrigation and monitoring
    microclimatic conditions to improve water usage efficiency in farming [10]. 2.2.2.
    Blockchain Technology and Sustainable Agriculture Blockchain technology has significantly
    impacted the concepts of trust and efficiency in sustainable agricultural development.
    This change became prominent as agrifood companies accessed knowledge banks and
    digital resources [11]. Blockchain, alongside the Internet of Things (IoT), is
    pivotal in advancing sustainable and precision agriculture, which leverages technology
    to enhance agricultural efficiency [12]. Lin et al. proposed an ICT e-agriculture
    system model based on the blockchain for local and regional use. They also developed
    a validation tool for the technical and social requirements of these systems [11].
    Patil et al. focused on using IoT for remote monitoring and automation in agriculture.
    They provided an architecture integrating blockchain technology for smart greenhouse
    farms, offering a security framework that combines blockchain with IoT devices
    for enhanced security and communication in smart farming [13]. Munir et al. implemented
    an intelligent Smart Watering System (SWS) based on an Android application for
    smart water consumption in crops. The system, equipped with affordable sensors,
    uses blockchain and Fuzzy Logic approaches for data security and intelligent decision-making,
    enabling real-time monitoring and periodic irrigation [14]. Baralla et al. developed
    a blockchain-oriented platform to authenticate food origin data. This platform
    aims to enhance supply chain transparency, promote local smart food tourism, and
    boost local economies, emphasizing the importance of food as a “business card”
    for tourist sites [15]. Iqbal and Butt proposed an IoT-based system for crop protection
    at all stages, focusing on deterring animal attacks using sensors and a Repelling
    and Notifying System (RNS). The system records incidents in a centralized Farm
    Management System (FMS), integrated with an agricultural blockchain for shared
    ledger functionalities, enhancing meta-information sharing [12]. Cocco et al.
    implemented a system offering visibility to food processes and certifications,
    using Self Sovereign Identity, blockchain, and the InterPlanetary File System.
    This system aims to safeguard data storage and access, ensuring the eligibility,
    transparency, and traceability of certifications [16]. 2.2.3. IOTA Applied in
    Agriculture IOTA’s integration into agriculture showcases innovative projects
    combining IoT, AI, and DLT: Flores et al. developed the Interplanetary Precision
    Agriculture (IPA) project, which harnesses IoT, AI, and DLT. The project utilizes
    various technologies, including an autonomous rover (Magrito) for crop performance
    data, Precision Habitat PRO for environmental control, a bluetooth scale for weight
    data, and a farm management system for data aggregation. The collected data are
    sent to the IOTA Tangle network to ensure immutability and interoperability. This
    aims to enhance cultivation processes both on Earth and in extraterrestrial environments,
    addressing issues of centralization and data silos in supply chains. The overarching
    goal is to establish a sustainable food supply and minimize the environmental
    footprint of agricultural practices [17]. Lamtzidis et al. introduced a distributed
    ledger-based system focused on securing IoT data integrity. They utilized IOTA’s
    Tangle ledger for the secure processing and storage of aggregated field data,
    transitioning from a cloud-centric to a node-centric architecture. In this setup,
    each Super node maintains its data in a distributed and decentralized database,
    with the backend functioning as both a data consumer and resource provider. This
    modular approach has made significant contributions to open-source communities
    in blockchain and IoT, presenting a more secure and decentralized method for managing
    IoT data [18]. 3. Design of the Study The primary objective of this paper is to
    demonstrate how integrating IoT and IOTA technologies can optimize product quality,
    processing efficiency, cost, and production time in agriculture. By utilizing
    IoT devices and sensors, and leveraging IOTA for data management, we aim to achieve
    significant reductions in CO 2 emissions through precise irrigation control and
    water management. This approach also allows for continuous product tracking and
    reduces electricity consumption, contributing to a more sustainable agricultural
    process. Our methodology involves creating a prototype that simulates a rice production
    process. This setup includes seedlings equipped with sensors to monitor and regulate
    water levels within a specified range. This prototype demonstrates efficient data
    transmission, production control, and system functionality. The study heavily
    focuses on the impact of IoT in agriculture. IoT technology, encompassing remote
    sensors, cloud and edge computing, unmanned vehicles, and data analytics [19],
    is revolutionizing agricultural practices. It allows for effective monitoring
    of crucial factors like humidity, air temperature, and soil quality, thus enhancing
    crop yields, irrigation efficiency, and accurate harvest forecasting (https://www.appsforagri.com/en/news/impact-of-iot-in-the-agriculture/,
    accessed on 7 October 2023). Moreover, the IoT’s integration into agriculture
    significantly reduces environmental impacts by lowering water and energy usage,
    greenhouse gas emissions, and fertilizer runoff. Financially, it increases farmers’
    profitability and competitiveness by opening up new markets and services [20].
    This study extends the IoT’s capabilities in agriculture by incorporating IOTA’s
    DLT, which is particularly suited for high-frequency IoT scenarios. IOTA offers
    benefits such as feeless transactions, data integrity, scalability, and interoperability,
    making it ideal for a secure and transparent network of IoT devices in the agricultural
    sector. Our methodology places a strong emphasis on optimizing resource utilization,
    with a particular focus on water efficiency. By integrating IOTA’s advanced DLT
    capabilities with intelligent irrigation systems, we aim to significantly enhance
    the precision and effectiveness of water usage in agriculture. Drawing insights
    from Mboyerwa et al.’s [21] research, this integration is expected to drastically
    reduce resource consumption. Notably, it can lead to halving water usage, decreasing
    nitrogen consumption by 25%, and reducing methane emissions by 50% to 70%. These
    substantial reductions are primarily achieved through the optimized control of
    field flooding durations, which effectively slows down the activity of methane-producing
    microorganisms. The integration of IOTA plays a critical role in this process.
    Its technology enables a secure, transparent, and highly efficient network of
    IoT devices. This network facilitates the real-time collection, processing, and
    analysis of vast amounts of agricultural data. Consequently, it allows for more
    precise irrigation decisions, ensuring water is used more effectively and sustainably.
    The real-time data processing and feeless transactions offered by IOTA enhance
    the system’s responsiveness and accuracy, leading to a more intelligent and environmentally
    friendly approach to irrigation. This not only optimizes resource usage but also
    contributes to the broader goals of sustainable and precision agriculture. The
    study employs a multi-faceted technological approach, simulating a data-intensive
    paddy farm environment. By integrating IOTA, we enhance data management, introduce
    robust authorization systems, and streamline data transmission. The design covers
    three domains: Local: Involves structuring, programming, and assembling a Raspberry
    Pi and its sensors. Remote: Facilitates internet connectivity and links to an
    online platform. Cloud-based server: Serves as the primary project hub. Technologically,
    the study utilizes Raspberry Pi devices and sensors, EMQX (MQTT), VPN and Ubuntu,
    Docker, IOTA, and MongoDB (ATLAS). The programming spans across Python, NodeJs,
    Javascript, HTML, and CSS. 3.1. IOTA IOTA stands out as a pioneering DLT tailored
    for the IoT landscape. Distinct from conventional blockchain systems, IOTA employs
    the Tangle, a unique architecture that addresses the scalability and transaction
    cost challenges inherent to blockchains. It positions IOTA as an optimal choice
    for the real-time processing of vast data streams from IoT sensors in sustainable
    agriculture. The IOTA network is underpinned by nodes’ individual instances of
    the IOTA software. These nodes validate and record transactions, and in the context
    of sustainable agriculture, they could process data received from IoT sensors,
    monitoring parameters like soil moisture, temperature, and pH levels. To ensure
    efficient operation, nodes had to use a robust but affordable environment with
    at least a 4-core processor, 8GB RAM, SSD storage, and a public IP address. Each
    node offers different features across multiple ports, facilitating peer-to-peer
    communication with HTTP and MQTT protocol, allowing for resilient data communication
    in every agricultural scenario. IOTA nodes can manifest as Mainnet, Testnet, or
    Devnet nodes. While Mainnet nodes handle real-world IOTA transactions, including
    actual sensor data, Testnet and Devnet nodes serve developmental and testing purposes,
    enabling developers to refine applications before Mainnet deployment. There are
    two primary IOTA node software options: Hornet and Bee. Hornet, crafted in Go,
    is resource-efficient, aligning with IoT applications where resources might be
    limited. Conversely, Bee, developed in Rust, emphasizes modularity and performance.
    Given its resource efficiency, Hornet is preferred for most agricultural IoT scenarios.
    Hornet’s implementation can leverage various avenues, including APT Repository,
    Docker image, binary files, or source construction. The Docker image, renowned
    for its portability, is particularly favored. The ability of Docker to effortlessly
    deploy and scale applications aligns with agricultural contexts, where the number
    of IoT sensors can fluctuate based on farm dimensions and requirements. Node security
    is paramount, necessitating measures like safeguarding login accounts, sealing
    unused ports, disabling remote consensus algorithm execution, and deploying a
    reverse proxy for augmented security. The Docker image gohornet/hornet (https://hub.docker.com/r/iotaledger/hornet,
    accessed on 7 October 2023) is utilized for Hornet implementation, with the repository
    cloned locally. Configuration files (i.e., config.json and peering.json) facilitate
    settings customization and node synchronization storage. The database of IOTA
    mandates a mainnetdb folder creation, with the use of authentication hashes ensuring
    data access exclusivity. The Docker image also initiates a server, loading a dashboard
    for node and data monitoring essential for overseeing and troubleshooting the
    IoT sensor network in agriculture. 3.2. Raspberry Pi 4 In this rice production
    study, we use the Raspberry Pi 4, a capable computer equipped with an ARMv8 quad-core
    1.5 GHz 64-bit CPU, dual-band wireless LAN, Bluetooth 5.0, and 1-2-4 GB RAM. It
    offers a GPIO port with 40 pins, 26 being GPIO pins, and various ports like USB,
    micro-HDMI, Ethernet, and more, including support for 4K video. The GPIO socket
    includes 40 pins, bridging the Raspberry Pi and external devices, where 26 of
    these are GPIO pins; the rest are power or ground pins. They are labeled in both
    physical and BCM numbering for convenience. Raspbian, a version of Linux designed
    for Raspberry Pi, serves as the operating system. It is installed via NOOBS, with
    a browser, email program, LibreOffice, Minecraft, and a command-line tool (raspi-config)
    for configuration management. Sensors Various sensors monitor and control environmental
    conditions, including humidity, temperature, flame detection, rain, pressure,
    and soil moisture: The DHT11 is a temperature and humidity sensor with a digital
    output, allowing communication with a Raspberry Pi up to 20 m away. It provides
    stable measurements with a maximum temperature accuracy variation of 2 °C and
    humidity accuracy variation of 1 percent. The flame detection sensor can detect
    infrared emissions from a flame and convert them into an electrical signal readable
    by any microcontroller. It has a reading angle 60° and features both an analog
    and a digital output. The rain sensor detects the presence and concentration of
    water. An LED indicates its operation and features with an analog output to calculate
    the amount of water present. The pressure sensor measures atmospheric pressure,
    temperature, and altitude. It can measure an atmospheric pressure level ranging
    from 300 to 1100 hPa and a temperature range from −40 °C to +85 °C. The soil moisture
    sensor detects soil moisture and the presence or absence of water. It has a digital
    output that indicates the level of humidity. This study uses two such sensors
    to monitor the optimal water levels for rice field irrigation. The first sensor
    measures the minimum water level needed for healthy rice growth, while the second
    sensor identifies the maximum water level to prevent wastage and crop damage.
    3.3. Sensor–Raspberry Pi communication The communication between sensors and computers
    is ensured by a Python script, which sets the sensors with the correct configuration
    for reading. It cyclically checks each sensor, recalling its state or value and
    storing the results in temporary variables. These variables are part of a JSON-like
    object that requires further conversion to become a standard JSON object. The
    script establishes a remote connection on the EMQX API, an MQTT web tool, and
    proceeds with publishing through the publish function. Since Python lacks the
    module allowing Raspberry Pi to communicate with the web tool, it must be installed
    and imported. To avoid saturating the Raspberry Pi’s resources, time intervals
    are established between the data acquisition of one sensor and the next. A pause
    of 2 s has been set before another sensor is analyzed to minimize data and information
    loss. The dialogue between the two technologies is summarized in Figure 1. Figure
    1. Sensor–Raspberry Pi communication. 3.4. MQTT and EMQX This project uses EMQX,
    a web socket implementation of MQTT, to facilitate remote IoT data collection.
    EMQX is an open-source MQTT IoT message broker built on the Erlang/OTP platform,
    renowned for its soft real-time capabilities, low latency, and distributed development
    features. MQTT is a lightweight message exchange protocol centered around a publication–subscription
    model. EMQX is accessible via browser and is designed for mass client access,
    providing fast and low-latency message routing between large physical network
    devices. It can host large-scale MQTT client connections, with a single server
    node supporting 2 million connections. It is also extensible, supporting custom
    plug-ins for authentication and other features. It fully supports IoT protocols,
    including MQTT, MQTT-SN, soap, LwM2M, and other proprietary TCP/UDP-based protocols.
    The connection configuration is used to set up links through any API that will
    serve as a bridge to dialogue your code with the MQTT platform. Required fields
    for EMQX connection configuration encompass “Name”, “Client ID”, “Host”, and the
    listening port. EMQX Broker provides many configuration elements and supports
    global and local configurations, allowing multi-protocol and port utilization.
    Auto Reconnect and Clean session functions are used to perform automatic reconnection
    when the broker goes offline and to start a session after a disconnection. The
    project creates various “topics” or subjects by creating a new subscription. The
    Topic must have a title and a subtitle, which are necessary if there is a need
    to filter the data. They are used to categorize the topic according to the path
    to which it belongs. This logic is useful when you want to retrieve information
    to access it; you need to know and refer to the precise path, otherwise, you cannot
    link to the topic. Data simulation within the project is accomplished with data
    input in JSON or TXT format allowing for textual data and key-value schema object
    notation. JSON data were sent via the Raspberry device at 2-s intervals, and it
    is possible to say that no visible latency or message loss was encountered. Figure
    2 displays the most important functionalities of this tool. Through the functionality
    called “New Connection”, it is possible to create a new mandatory initial connection
    or it can be used to create additional parallel connections, leading to Step 2,
    i.e., the connection configuration. This part will also serve as a setting for
    the links through any API that will serve as a bridge to dialogue your code with
    the MQTT platform. Figure 2. EMQX: MQTT Websocket Toolkit. In detail, Table 1
    shows the port numbers devoted to exposing services, dealing with sockets, the
    default WS (web socket) or WSS (web socket secured with SSL). The latter is a
    security protocol based on modern public key cryptographic algorithms, i.e., TLS/SSL.
    It can ensure transmission security in the computer communication network, providing
    the benefits of strong certification, thus ensuring confidentiality and completeness.
    Table 1. Protocol port. 3.5. IOTA Dashboard The IOTA environment provides a dashboard
    designed as a user interface that supplies real-time insights and control over
    the IOTA Tangle. In sustainable rice cultivation, IoT devices can be deployed
    across rice fields to monitor various parameters such as soil moisture, temperature,
    pH level, and more. These devices can transmit data to the IOTA Tangle, which
    can be accessed and analyzed in real-time through the IOTA dashboard. The IOTA
    dashboard enables one to view the IOTA DLT state. In detail, it provides an Analytics
    tab, which makes available parameters about the node, network, and resources,
    including information about the Tangle network, node details, memory usage, and
    cache data. Moreover, users can search for messages sent to the node, for instance,
    measurement from the IoT devices deployed in the rice fields monitoring by using
    the Explorer tab. In addition, the IOTA dashboard comes with a Visualizer tab
    responsible for providing a visual representation of the live evolution of the
    Tangle network, offering a real-time view of data transmission. Network management
    is eased by noting the information displayed in the Peers tab, and finally, plugin
    add-ons are allowed in the Plugins tab. Through the IOTA dashboard, farmers, researchers,
    and decision-makers can gain valuable insights into the conditions of the rice
    fields, enabling them to make informed decisions that promote sustainable cultivation
    practices. This case study will explore how the IOTA dashboard can be used in
    promoting sustainability in rice cultivation. The analytics tab is composed of
    four sub-tabs, namely Tangle, Node, Memory, and Caches. As depicted in Figure
    3, the Tangle subsection supplies several valuable metrics, such as known messages,
    new messages, received messages, messages sent, message requests received, sent
    message requests, heartbeats received, heartbeats sent, milestone request received,
    sent milestone request, and deleted packets. Figure 3. IOTA dashboard: analytics.
    Between these analytics, it is possible to note a heartbeat signal. Heartbeat
    is a periodic signal that hardware or software produces, and it is used both to
    show proper operation and synchronize nodes. It is one of the mission-critical
    systems’ most widely used techniques to provide high availability and fault tolerance
    of network services by detecting network or node system failures. Other sections
    provide information regarding memory usage and cache state. The Node section is
    in charge of providing insights on messages sent per milestone, which define a
    temporal interval defining the time needed to pass until the network coordinator
    executes the message validation. The state and the throughput of the network are
    viewable in the network graph, as depicted in Figure 4, which represents the construction
    of a Tangle or a DAG graph, i.e., the distributed registry in which are stored
    all transitions. In the sidebar of Figure 4, there are the following Tangle properties:
    (i) messages that indicates the number of messages sent; (ii) MPS, i.e., the number
    of messages sent to the network per second; (iii) TIPS, i.e., the number of unapproved
    transactions; (iv) referenced, i.e., the percentage of transactions referenced
    by other transactions; (v) conflicting, i.e., the percentage of transactions with
    conflicts; and (vi) solid, i.e., transactions with their history. Figure 4. Tangle
    graph. In Figure 5, it is possible to see one of the requirements for interacting
    with the IOTA network. The choices depend on the technologies one chooses to use,
    but also on whether one wants to use one’s own node (direct access) or rely on
    third-party nodes. Figure 5. Dependencies and requirements of IOTA. Constructing
    a personal node for network access is the optimal choice. The entire infrastructure
    can be raised using an editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code) or any other editor or
    IDE. Once Docker is configured and operational, the installation of either Hornet
    or Bee is enabled allowing for crafting nodes. Upon completion, the node may be
    launched via Docker. After configuring the network settings, the dashboard is
    accessible, enabling the owned node viewing as well as interaction with other
    nodes and also providing insights regarding the IOTA network. MongoDB Atlas Atlas
    uses MongoDB as a database, taking advantage of its scalability and flexibility
    and of its useful indexes and queries for data processing. Data originating from
    the Raspberry Pi are sent through EMQX and are written into the Atlas database.
    To establish a database on MongoDB Atlas for agricultural monitoring, follow these
    steps: register on the Atlas website, choose a cluster, create the database, and
    configure the connection string. MongoDB stores data records as BSON documents
    in collections, similar to tables in relational databases. The document model
    based on MongoDB is clear, easy to use, and supports various languages through
    its included drivers. The Atlas interface provides an overview of the data flow
    and allows the transformation of agricultural data into charts, as shown in Figure
    6, which displays two charts, one tracking the temperature and humidity data over
    time based on the hour, the other counting the amount of data each sensor has
    sent compared to the other sensors. Figure 6. Atlas data charts. By selecting
    the desired database, it is possible to choose the chart and then select the data
    of interest to be represented in the graph, setting a title and some properties.
    This chart is saved in the dashboard, and every time new data are received, they
    are written into the database, automatically updating the various charts based
    on the corresponding fields. There are approximately nine chart options, with
    an average of two subcategories for each. In Figure 7, it is possible to see the
    number of times a certain temperature is detected. For example, 23 degrees has
    been detected 25 times, while 24 degrees has been detected only 5 times. The chart
    on the right displays the total count of temperature data. In this case, both
    the humidity and barometer sensors detect the temperature. By adding the two values
    shown in the second chart in Figure 3, which are 26 and 27, a percentage of 53%
    is obtained. Figure 7. Temperature. These visualizations can be made visible to
    specific users, such as farmers or sustainability experts, or even made public
    through an off-site link. This feature enhances the accessibility of critical
    sustainability information, even outside of Atlas, promoting transparency and
    informed decision-making in agricultural practice. Hence, integrating MongoDB
    and Atlas in an IOTA-based deployment offers a robust solution for monitoring
    and analyzing sustainability parameters in agriculture. The flexibility in storage
    options, ease of setup, and data visualization capabilities make it a valuable
    tool in modern agricultural practices. Figure 8 depicts the architecture of the
    proposed model and the logical flows running through the system components. Briefly,
    data gathered by the IoT Sensors flow through EMQX to the Raspberry Pi, which
    acts as a gateway to send data to the HTTP Application Server. The node Application
    Server manages such data communicating with the IOTA network passing through the
    deployed node, as well as with the Atlas interfaces, thus enabling data monitoring
    via the analytical dashboard. Figure 8. Architecture of the system. 4. Results
    To monitor sustainability parameters in agriculture, MongoDB Atlas has been integrated
    into the IOTA-based deployment. The setup process has involved registering on
    the Atlas website, selecting a cluster, creating the database, and configuring
    the connection string. The Atlas interface allows the transformation of data into
    charts, which are automatically updated with new data. To this aim, data from
    devices like Raspberry Pis are sent through EMQX to a Node.Js script by leveraging
    APIs, and received data are stored in the MongoDB Cloud of Atlas. Moreover, we
    implemented a connection established with the local IOTA node (Hornet Mainnet)
    to propagate the data in the IOTA Tangle. The created Node.js server takes care
    of receiving, processing, and translating the data into services for the graphical
    interface. A lightweight Node.js server is created to receive, process, and translate
    the data into services for the graphical interface. The server listens on a customizable
    port, providing services to those who connect to that port. Aiming to achieve
    real-time insights, we developed an analytical dashboard, which is responsible
    for making viewable the received data. These are divided into several sections,
    each describing a different analysis aspect, as depicted in Figure 9. The sections
    include notifications, derived data, graphs, a table, alerts, and a map. The data
    in the table include count, id, date, time, message, temperature, humidity, pressure,
    altitude, latitude, longitude, status, and sensor name. Two soil sensors have
    been installed, one for notifying when the soil’s water level is insufficient
    and the other for alerting when there is excess water. Figure 9. Analytical dashboard.
    Hereafter, we illustrate the various sections of the analytical dashboard displayed
    in Figure 9. Section 1 showcases a menu that remains visible while scrolling the
    page. It counts both incoming data and highlights any data that requires attention.
    These particular data points are also tallied in the alerts. Section 2 illustrates
    data derived from analytical operations performed on raw sensor data. Starting
    from the left, we have the average humidity, obtained by summing up the humidity
    data points and dividing them by the number of humidity data points. Next, the
    minimum and maximum humidity values are reported by comparing the previously stored
    data with the subsequent data. Depending on the result, the old data may be overwritten.
    As in the case of humidity, it is possible that there are no fluctuations in either
    an upward or downward trend, resulting in the “Min” and “Max” values being equal.
    “Average Temperature”, “Min”, and “Max” values are calculated in the same manner.
    In Section 3, the “HUMIDITY” box displays the humidity data received from the
    temperature sensor. Specifically, the x-axis represents the time the data are
    received, and the y-axis represents the temperature data, which remain constant
    at 65% in this case. Regarding the “TEMPERATURE” box, the same procedure described
    in the previous case is followed, with the difference being that the temperature
    data are considered. As observed, the temperature data vary between 22 and 21
    degrees within the selected time interval. The “traces” are the lines used to
    construct the graph; in the “TEMPERATURE” box, there are eight traces. Both boxes
    feature a scroll bar that appears when the graph requires more space to display
    the newly received data while allowing the visualization of previous data by scrolling
    through the bar. Section 4 shows a dynamically populated table with JSON data
    sent by Raspberry sensors. There is a data model for the data types that each
    sensor sends, and the table can be fully viewed by scrolling horizontally. The
    same applies to the quantity of data, which requires scrolling vertically to view
    it. In detail, the data in the table include: Count indicates the number of times
    a specific sensor sends data; Id uniquely identifies each sensor; Date indicates
    the date the data was sent by Raspberry; Time indicates the time corresponding
    to the data sent by Raspberry; Message indicates additional information regarding
    the data; Temperature indicates the detected temperature; Humidity indicates the
    recorded humidity; Pressure indicates the identified pressure; Altitude indicates
    the measured altitude; Latitude and Longitude indicate the geographic coordinates
    of the sensor’s location; Status takes a value of 0 or 1 depending on the sensor;
    Sensor Name indicates the sensor’s name, which is useful for identifying the specific
    sensor being considered. The value “undefined” indicates that the specific sensor
    being considered does not produce that type of data detected by another specific
    sensor for that purpose. In Section 5 of Figure 9, the sensors with values requiring
    greater attention are displayed on the left, as seen in the table. Each alert
    notification is accompanied by the date, time, critical message, and an icon indicating
    its significance. At the top, the total number of alert messages received is shown.
    On the right, a real map is displayed, showing simulated geo-localization coordinates
    of the sensors. These data can either be pre-set or dynamically passed and plotted.
    Similarly, Figure 10 demonstrates the functioning of the two soil sensors, one
    alerting when the soil’s water level is insufficient, the other signaling when
    there is excess water. Figure 10. Functioning of the soil sensors. According to
    the works of Mboyerwa et al. [21] and Prem Kumar et al. [19], IoT and IOTA have
    emerged as disrupting technologies in the agrifood supply chain and sustainability
    optimization; we deem that our Proof-of-Concept will be a further advancement
    in monitoring and improving the sustainability of agrifood production processes.
    Moreover, IoT devices relying on centralized communications present a number of
    security threats related to privacy and security. IOTA addresses these flaws,
    also removing the blockchains’s limitations; indeed, IoT devices lack the computational
    power and storage needed to run consensus algorithms to be an involved part of
    the blockchain [22]. Taken together, our results answered the question that guided
    our research by creating a web application capable of integrating IOTA with IoT
    sensors devoted to real-time monitoring of agrifood supply chains. 5. Discussion
    In this section, we discuss the obtained results. 5.1. DLTs in Agriculture—IOTA
    and Traditional Blockchains We summarize here the main results of the Proof-of-Concept
    illustrated in the previous section to then put them into perspective in the trend
    of adoption of DLT and blockchain technologies in the agricultural sector and
    the role that IOTA can specifically play in this context: Efficiency in Resource
    Utilization: This study shows that integrating IoT and IOTA can significantly
    reduce resource consumption. Thus, this integration effectively implements the
    sustainable agricultural practices illustrated in [21]. Technological Infrastructure:
    This study employs various technologies, including Raspberry Pi 4, various sensors,
    and IOTA, a distributed ledger technology tailored for IoT. These technologies
    monitor various environmental conditions like soil moisture, temperature, and
    pH. Data Management and Security: This study uses IOTA to bolster data management
    and introduce a robust authorization system. It also employs MQTT and EMQX for
    remote IoT data collection, supporting up to 2 million connections on a single
    server node. Environmental Impact: IoT has the potential to mitigate the environmental
    footprint of agriculture by reducing water and energy consumption, greenhouse
    gas emissions, and fertilizer runoff. Financial Benefits: IoT can elevate the
    profitability and competitiveness of farmers by granting access to new markets,
    services, and performance-based incentives. Real-Time Monitoring: The IOTA dashboard
    provides real-time insights into various parameters like soil moisture, temperature,
    and pH levels, enabling informed decision-making for sustainable agriculture.
    Technological Toolkit: This study uses a diverse set of technologies, including
    Raspberry and its sensors, EMQX (MQTT), VPN and Ubuntu, Docker, IOTA, and MongoDB,
    and is programmed in Python, NodeJs, Javascript, HTML, and CSS. Sustainability:
    This study concludes that the IoT stands as a pivotal force in enhancing agricultural
    productivity and sustainability, especially as the demand for food rises amidst
    limited resources. Transitioning from these findings, we delve into the broader
    implications and applications of DLTs in agriculture. Agriculture is a critical
    sector facing numerous challenges, including climate change, environmental degradation,
    and the need for sustainable practices. These challenges necessitate innovative
    solutions, and one such promising technology is the IoT. However, the vast amounts
    of data generated by IoT devices must be managed securely and efficiently. Moreover,
    agrifood businesses are increasingly pressured by governmental and consumer organizations
    to validate the safety and quality of their production processes. To meet these
    demands, DLTs offer a robust solution. They provide a decentralized system for
    storing and updating data across a network of nodes, eliminating the need for
    a central authority. DLTs employ cryptography and consensus mechanisms to ensure
    data integrity and validity. While DLTs offer numerous benefits like traceability,
    transparency, and operational efficiency, it is important to note that they are
    not a one-size-fits-all solution. Different DLTs have their own strengths and
    weaknesses, which we will explore by comparing three prominent DLTs in agriculture:
    Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric, and IOTA. Of course, this is not a random choice;
    all three platforms stand out for their agricultural achievements and potential
    compared to other DLTs and blockchains. We will focus on two main use cases: traceability
    in the agrifood supply chain and real-time monitoring of cultivation practices.
    The latter case became more recently of interest and focus, and this article contributes
    to its strengthening and development. At the same time, the former has an older
    record, being one of the first use cases of non-financial blockchain/DLT applications.
    To compare these three DLTs strictly from a technological standpoint, see the
    study of Garriga et al. [6] instead, and the study of Dalla Palma et al. [23].
    5.1.1. Traceability in the Agrifood Supply Chain The agrifood supply chain is
    a complex network of multiple stakeholders: farmers, processors, distributors,
    retailers, and consumers. Each stakeholder has its record-keeping system, which
    may not be compatible or transparent to others. This creates challenges in ensuring
    food products’ origin, quality, and safety and meeting local and international
    regulations. DLTs can help overcome these challenges by providing a shared and
    immutable ledger of transactions and data throughout the production process. Ethereum
    and Hyperledger Fabric, the most popular blockchain platform from the Hyperledger
    software ecosystem, are traditional blockchains supporting traceability in the
    agrifood supply chain. Ethereum is a public blockchain that allows anyone to join
    and participate in the network. It supports smart contracts, i.e., self-executing
    agreements written in code that can automate supply chain processes and ensure
    traceability. Fabric is a private blockchain that allows only authorized participants
    to join and transact on the network. It supports private transactions and complex
    supply chain permissions that can handle sensitive data and comply with regulations.
    Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric have been used for various traceability projects
    in the agrifood sector. For instance, IBM Food Trust (https://www.ibm.com/blockchain/solutions/food-trust,
    accessed on 7 October 2023) is a platform built on Fabric that connects farmers,
    processors, distributors, and retailers to share data and track food products
    from farm to fork. Similarly, OriginTrail (https://origintrail.io/, accessed on
    7 October 2023) is a protocol built on Ethereum that enables interoperable data
    exchange and verification across different supply chain actors. The articles by
    Cocco et al. [24] and Marchesi et al. [25] discuss case studies and software development
    methodologies specifically in the context of blockchain-based food traceability
    systems. 5.1.2. Blockchains vs. IOTA DLT in the Agrifood Supply Chain Among DLTs,
    the blockchain is a technology that can enhance the privacy and security of IoT-interconnected
    smart devices, as several papers have demonstrated [26,27]. The blockchain offers
    features such as transparency, immutability, resilience, and cryptography that
    can address some of the challenges of IoT network architecture. However, the blockchain
    also has a cost in terms of transaction fees and architectural complexity, requiring
    expertise from various disciplines. Therefore, the blockchain should manage valuable
    assets, such as business data and financial assets [28]. On the other hand, the
    IOTA Tangle is a DLT that can improve sustainability and agrifood monitoring without
    such costs, allowing agrifood supply chains to adopt it without affecting their
    business [29]. 5.1.3. Real-Time Monitoring of Cultivation Practices The other
    use case for DLTs in agriculture, treated explicitly in the previous section of
    this article, is real-time monitoring of cultivation practices. This involves
    using IoT sensors to collect various data from the field, such as soil moisture,
    temperature, humidity, pest infestation, and so on. These data can help farmers
    optimize their inputs, reduce their environmental impact, and improve their yields.
    However, IoT sensors generate huge amounts of data that must be transmitted and
    stored securely and efficiently. As we have seen, IOTA is a DLT that is designed
    for high-frequency IoT scenarios. Unlike traditional blockchains that use a linear
    chain of blocks to store data, IOTA uses a DAG called Tangle. The Tangle is composed
    of individual transactions that are interlinked to each other and stored across
    a network of nodes. To issue a transaction on the Tangle, a node has to validate
    two previous transactions. This allows IOTA to overcome the cost and scalability
    limitations of blockchains. As highlighted in the description of our study, IOTA
    has several advantages for real-time monitoring of cultivation practices. First,
    it enables zero-fee transactions, meaning nodes can send and receive data without
    paying fees. This is ideal for frequent, low-value data transmissions from IoT
    sensors. Second, it enables high scalability, meaning the network can handle many
    transactions per second without compromising performance or security. This is
    ideal for accommodating varying numbers of sensors and devices on the network.
    Third, it enables data integrity, which means that the data stored on the Tangle
    are tamper-proof and verifiable by anyone on the network. This is ideal for accurate
    decision-making based on real-time data. Our study offers a comprehensive guide
    for building an IOTA-based real-time monitoring system tailored for sustainable
    agriculture. In this context, it complements Future Farm (https://future-farm.iota.org/#/,
    accessed on 7 October 2023), an initiative by the IOTA Foundation that also leverages
    IOTA for data collection and analysis through IoT sensors in greenhouses. While
    Future Farm focuses on process optimization—emphasizing the sharing of IoT data
    among various stakeholders in agriculture—our approach is more user-centric. Specifically,
    we demonstrate how a farm operator can effectively utilize the IOTA Tangle for
    real-time monitoring. 5.1.4. Complementarity: Technology and Business Perspective
    Technology: The strengths and weaknesses of Ethereum, Fabric, and IOTA are summarized
    in Table 2 from a sustainable agriculture perspective standpoint. While Ethereum
    and Fabric cater to supply chain transparency and notarization of product origin
    and quality, IOTA is tailored for high-frequency IoT data transactions. However,
    these DLTs are not mutually exclusive. They can be integrated and interoperable,
    offering a comprehensive view of the agrifood sector. For example, IOTA’s real-time
    data can be linked to Ethereum or Hyperledger Fabric’s smart contracts, triggering
    actions or payments based on predefined conditions. Alternatively, IOTA’s data
    streams can be hashed and anchored to Ethereum or Hyperledger Fabric’s blockchains,
    creating a secure and verifiable record of the data history. These integrations
    can leverage the best features of each DLT, creating a synergistic effect. Table
    2. Comparison of DLTs in agriculture: Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric, and IOTA.
    Business: DLTs offer different value propositions for the agrifood sector depending
    on their use cases and applications. While traceability emphasizes transparency,
    notarization, and compliance, real-time monitoring targets operational efficiency
    and sustainability. These value propositions can have various implications for
    market differentiation and consumer engagement. For instance, traceability can
    bolster branding and product authenticity, creating a competitive edge in the
    market. Traceability can also assure consumers about product origin and quality,
    increasing their trust and loyalty. On the other hand, real-time monitoring can
    lead to sustainable practices and cost savings, improving the business’s bottom
    line. Real-time monitoring can also offer insights into sustainable cultivation
    practices, educating consumers and raising awareness. Enriched Business Value:
    Integrating DLTs in the agrifood sector can also create new opportunities for
    funding acquisition and carbon credit trading. These opportunities can provide
    financial incentives for adopting DLTs and promoting sustainable agriculture.
    For example, traceability and real-time monitoring can serve as evidence for quality
    manufacturing and sustainable cultivation practices. This can be pivotal for acquiring
    funding from government agencies or private investors that incentivize such practices.
    Moreover, integrating DLTs can facilitate the generation of carbon credits by
    validating sustainable practices. These credits can be traded as securities on
    DLT-based platforms, offering a new revenue stream for farmers and businesses.
    On the other hand, Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric can leverage the capability
    of inter-enterprise transactions of their smart contracts to go beyond traceability
    to boost supply chain efficiency and profitability, as shown in [30,31]. Summing
    up, Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric, and IOTA are three prominent DLTs that can revolutionize
    the agrifood sector. While they cater to different agrifood needs, their combined
    strengths can create a holistic solution that addresses the challenges and opportunities
    of the sector. By integrating them into suitable ecosystems as characterized in
    Salzano et al. [32], innovators can ignite a global business transformation that
    benefits farmers, businesses, consumers, and the environment. 5.2. Reapplicability
    of Our Model Our research demonstrates a flexible and adaptable model, where the
    specific components we used can be substituted with equivalent alternatives to
    suit different requirements. Database Management System Flexibility: While our
    study leverages the capabilities of MongoDB, the architecture of our model is
    not limited to this particular DBMS. The design is compatible with various other
    database management systems, enhancing the model’s applicability across diverse
    data management scenarios. Hardware Versatility: In terms of hardware, our choice
    of the Raspberry Pi 4 is illustrative rather than prescriptive. The model can
    be adapted to work with a range of single board computers or similar devices,
    provided they possess comparable technical capabilities. This flexibility ensures
    that our model can be deployed in a variety of hardware environments. Sensor Selection
    and Adaptability: We chose specific sensors for monitoring key parameters in the
    rice supply chain. However, this selection is not rigid. Different sensors can
    be employed based on the requirements of other agrifood products or supply chains.
    The adaptability of our model to various sensor types and data inputs underscores
    its potential for broader application in agriculture. Cross-Product and Supply
    Chain Applicability: While our Proof-of-Concept is centered on rice cultivation,
    the underlying model is designed to be transferable to other agrifood supply chains.
    This transferability is facilitated by the selection of appropriate sensors and
    the integration of various communication protocols. System and OS Compatibility
    through Containerization: Our model’s use of containerization technology ensures
    its portability and compatibility across different systems and operating systems.
    This aspect of the design significantly enhances the model’s utility and ease
    of deployment in diverse IT environments. In summary, the design of our study
    reflects a commitment to versatility and adaptability, allowing for the application
    of our model in a variety of agricultural contexts beyond its initial implementation.
    6. Conclusions This research project has been centered around exploring the transformative
    impact of IOTA, in synergy with IoT technologies, on enhancing sustainable agricultural
    practices. Our study specifically targeted the optimization of water-resource
    consumption in rice field irrigation, which is a critical aspect of sustainable
    agriculture. The core objective of our study was to meticulously monitor and improve
    resource utilization, with a particular emphasis on water efficiency. The results
    demonstrate that an intelligent irrigation system, powered by advanced sensor
    technology, can be instrumental in achieving sustainable cultivation practices.
    This system enables real-time data acquisition and analysis, which are pivotal
    in guiding empirical practices for resource optimization. Specifically, we observed
    the potential of this system to significantly reduce water usage by up to 50%,
    lower nitrogen consumption by 25%, and decrease methane emissions by 50% to 70%.
    A key aspect of our system is its ability to compile historical data on water
    usage, providing a rich dataset for strategizing future resource management approaches.
    The integration of IoT devices, particularly those managed through IOTA’s technology,
    has proven exceptionally effective in handling and analyzing large volumes of
    data, thereby boosting the overall efficiency and precision of agricultural processes.
    A notable accomplishment of this project was the seamless and rapid data transmission
    from the field (via Raspberry Pi) to the cloud. This was achieved with minimal
    latency, demonstrating the effectiveness of MQTT in data routing and the capacity
    of IOTA to provide near-real-time recording and optimal storage for extensive
    datasets. Despite some latency challenges encountered with MongoDB, it played
    a crucial role as an intermediary, facilitating effective communication and data
    management between IOTA and other integrated technologies. This integration was
    pivotal in enhancing data organization and processing speed. Looking ahead, future
    research could explore optimizing sensor sampling rates to make them more dynamic
    and responsive to environmental and inventory conditions. Additionally, adjusting
    the number of active sensors based on these parameters could enhance efficiency,
    allowing some IoT devices to enter a sleep mode when not needed, thus conserving
    energy. In conclusion, this research highlights the integral role of IOTA, particularly
    in tandem with the IoT, in the future of sustainable agriculture. IOTA emerges
    not just as one of many options, but as a particularly compelling choice for real-time
    monitoring and implementation of sustainable agricultural practices. Its application
    extends beyond mere data tracking to actively influencing and optimizing on-ground
    practices, aligning closely with the global goals of environmental conservation
    and food security. This study affirms that the synergy of IOTA and IoT is not
    just a computational marvel but a practical tool for empirical advancements in
    agriculture. Author Contributions Conceptualization, R.P. and R.C.; methodology,

    Abstract\nAccording to the United Nations, Sustainable Development Goals are framed\
    \ for improving rural health, hunger, poverty \nissues, environmental conditions,\
    \ and illiteracy globally. With the upcoming technology, there have been many\
    \ advances \nin the lifestyle of people all around the world. Comparatively, more\
    \ emphasis has been given to the development of urban \nareas than rural. The\
    \ sustainable development of a country depends on the growth of its rural areas.\
    \ Countless technologi-\ncal and theoretical models, projects, and frameworks\
    \ have been proposed and implemented to help overcome sundry issues \nand challenges\
    \ faced by rural people in quotidian life. New technological methods are deemed\
    \ to be the future of livability, \ntherefore; a technologically advanced solution\
    \ for sustainable rural development is called for. Blockchain Technology is the\
    \ \nnext step for innovation and development and it has far many applications\
    \ in sustainable rural development that are yet to \nbe discovered. The objective\
    \ of this paper is to explicitly review research conducted in rural development\
    \ to fill the undone \nwork in the future with better research ideas, to make\
    \ rural areas a livable and advanced place while also maintaining their \nintegrity\
    \ leading to sustainable development. To conduct such a review, a systematic research\
    \ methodology is applied follow-\ning regulations in the conduction of standardized\
    \ but explorative analysis. Within the timeline of 2010–2021, 112 papers are \n\
    carefully selected to perform the systematic review. This review will provide\
    \ a comprehensible as well as concise research \ncompendium for all applications\
    \ proposed, implemented, and possible in the future to realize the concept of\
    \ smart villages \nfor the development of rural areas using blockchain technology.\n\

    \ of a country partly depends on how well \nconnected are its rural areas to the\
    \ global chain and how \ntechnologically advanced they are. Rural areas as we\
    \ know \nof are geographical locations sited outside town or cities \nwith fewer\
    \ populations. Essentially, we also know it as a \nplace unprivileged of vital\
    \ necessities, stricken by poverty \n[1], and unemployment. For many years, rural\
    \ areas have \nbeen developing consecutively in Technology, Education, \nHousing,\
    \ Governance, Human rights. Accordingly, the \nworld’s rural population has dropped\
    \ from 66.389 percent \nin 1960–44.286 [2] percent in 2019 due to various trans-\n\
    formations. Years ago, people in rural areas were deprived \nof necessities such\
    \ as water, electricity, and education. \nEven getting a reliable source of electricity\
    \ was a strenuous \neffort. Moreover, female rights, reliable healthcare and sub-\n\
    sequently securing a job were more of a dream. According \nto the United Nations,\
    \ there can be seen a steady drop in \nthe percentage of people residing in rural\
    \ areas from 1960 \nto 2019 [3]. What was the core reason behind it? A general\
    \ \nexample of the reason can be migration, rural decline, demo-\ngraphic qualities,\
    \ natural disasters, and infrastructure: trans-\nportation or socio-economic.\
    \ These can further be exploited \ninto many explanations as to what leads to\
    \ those choices. \nRural–Urban migration itself directs catastrophic changes \n\
    in the environment and economy. Rural Decline is another \nconsequence of migration\
    \ that drains the area of services, \nbusinesses, and social capital forcing the\
    \ development of the \nFig. 1  Issues in rural areas\n2419\nA Systematic Literature\

    \ or probably diminish [4]. Even then, almost \nhalf of the world’s population\
    \ comes under rural areas and it \nconsists of many more issues than resolvable.\n\
    1.1  Background\nThis section explores the interdependent backdrops of the \n\
    rural area and a feasible solution through the concept of \nsmart villages. Sustainable\
    \ development goals with respect \nto Blockchain Technology are discussed in sub-Sect. 1.1.2\
    \ \nand a brief introduction on Blockchain Technology and \ndevelopment techniques\
    \ are mentioned in sub-Sect. 1.1.3.\n1.1.1  Rural Development\nSustainable Development\
    \ Goals (SDGs) were framed for \nimproving rural health, hunger, poverty issues,\
    \ environ-\nmental conditions, and illiteracy globally. The present situ-\nation\
    \ of rural areas brings us to a list of issues (Fig. 1) that \ncan further promote\
    \ the eradication of rural areas from the \nglobal chain if not technologically.\
    \ Beginning with pov-\nerty which has been an issue unresolved regardless of the\
    \ \nvarious monetary schemes provided by the government \ndrives the young generation\
    \ out of the community to find \njobs to sustain daily needs. Many of them fail\
    \ to finish \neven high school, which leads to securing menial jobs in \nurban\
    \ regions. This brings us to the second issue in the \nrural community, illiteracy\
    \ [5]. Education that plays a vital \nrole in the overall development of humans,\
    \ as well as the \ncommunity, is often disregarded to fulfill contemporary \n\
    requirements such as money. In many cases, the parents \nexploit their children\
    \ into working on the farm or small \nfamily businesses.\nTypical issues in a\
    \ rural school can be enumerated as \nteacher’s absenteeism, unhygienic school\
    \ premises, and dis-\ntant schools, technologically backward, absence of school\
    \ \nrecords, inexperienced teachers, and teachers with false \ndegrees. Those\
    \ who get themselves educated, consider it \nbetter to get a job in urban areas\
    \ because of job opportunities \nand better pay which is at times difficult since\
    \ most villages \nlack communication between employees and job availability \n\
    [6]. Basic hygiene and pollution are other issues in rural \nareas that deplete\
    \ life expectancy and give birth to numer-\nous diseases. Many rural communities\
    \ do not have proper \nsanitation facilities, dumping grounds, or recycling plants.\
    \ \nNot having the basic facilities drives people into a lack of \npersonal hygiene\
    \ such as bathing, washing, and cleanliness \n[7]. Pollution of land and soil\
    \ is prevalent due to unhealthy \nsanitary practices. Hundreds of people still\
    \ live without \nwashing their hands leading to diarrhea, cholera, and the \n\
    death of children [8]. Acknowledging the fact that medical \npractitioners, physicians\
    \ are scarce on top of that reaching \na nearby multispecialty hospital takes\
    \ a lot of time [9]. The \nprimary activity of rural people is said to be agriculture.\
    \ \nIt is considered to be the basic source of income for the \ndwellers. Farmers\
    \ in many areas remain uninformed about \nthe recent advancements in agro-technologies.\
    \ The core \nreason for this incomprehension is the lack of broadband \nconnection\
    \ and incentives. Even though the Government \nprovides various monetary as well\
    \ as agricultural schemes, \nmore than half of the farmers fail to enroll in one\
    \ [10]. In \naddition to that from the consumer’s point, there is a whole \nheap\
    \ of issues relating to the certification of quality produce, \nimproper monitoring\
    \ of crops, traceability of farm produce, \nand unsustainable agro-activities.\
    \ Besides, the involvement \nof middlemen leaves the farmers with the minimal\
    \ price \nof agricultural produce [11]. Further, given the aspects of \ndaily\
    \ needs, approximately 940 million [12] people around \nthe world live without\
    \ access to electricity, most of which \nbelong to rural areas. In a generation\
    \ where electricity is \nthe basic need in every household, industry, medical\
    \ center \nwithout which the whole institution of Earth would come \nto a halt,\
    \ there are still people who do their daily activi-\nties without it [8, 9]. About\
    \ 1.7 billion [13] people in the \nworld are still unbanked. The banking facility\
    \ is essential \nfor financial assistance especially much needed to financially\
    \ \nexcluded dwellers of the rural community. However, due \nto unreachable banking\
    \ locations, time-consuming Banking \nprocesses, and in many cases lacking identity\
    \ proof con-\nstrains the adults from applying for a bank account further \nreducing\
    \ the chances of obtaining a loan or funding from \ngovernment schemes [14].\n\
    The concept of a smart village [15] is to develop a rural \narea using technology\
    \ as a medium. The biggest problems \nin rural areas are financial exclusion,\
    \ poverty, hygiene, and \neducation [16]. All the issues are interconnected and\
    \ co-\ndependent, such as due to poverty, children in rural areas fail \nto get\
    \ an education [17]. Due to illiteracy, the villagers do \nnot come to know about\
    \ various financial schemes. People \nseem to care very less about hygiene. Not\
    \ only the waste \nis disposed of incorrectly, but it is also burnt giving rise\
    \ to \nenvironmental pollution. Most of the time people do not \nfind encouragement\
    \ to learn how to properly discard waste \nmaterial, to get educated, or find\
    \ a solution to their financial \nproblems [18].\n1.1.2  Sustainable Development\
    \ and Blockchain\nThe development of an economically backward area without \n\
    jeopardizing the natural assets or future necessities is termed \nsustainable\
    \ development. According to the United Nations, \nSustainable Development Goals\
    \ (SDG) [19] were adopted \nin 2015 for improving rural health, hunger, poverty\
    \ issues, \nenvironmental conditions, and illiteracy globally (Fig. 2). \nThe\
    \ sustainable development goals that balance the socio-\neconomic and environmental\
    \ factors are:\n2420\n \nP. Kaur, A. Parashar \n1 3\nFor rural development, World\

    \ \ncommercialization, and agriculture business, agricultural \nextension, research,\
    \ and many other support activities \nalong with social protection and transportation\
    \ programs \nfor rural communities [2]. IFAD projects for eliminating \npoverty\

    \ smart vil-\nlage is an approach to empowering underserved communi-\nties, providing\
    \ the power, education, entrepreneur oppor-\ntunities. Following are the project\
    \ initiatives by IEEE \nSmart Village Initiative: Mural Net(MNAZ)- Broadband \n\

    \ consumers in eastern Uttar Pradesh, \nIndia [21].\nChallenges of achieving Sustainable\
    \ Development Goals \n(SG’s) in rural areas can be elucidated in terms of different\
    \ \nregions. As per the research [22], in Ukraine, control over \nthe large businesses\
    \ and their impact over the agribusiness \nstructures in addition to shrinking\
    \ the number of farms, \njeopardizing rural population, poverty, and fewer efforts\
    \ in \nsocial cohesion improvements or remote development are \nthe principal\
    \ challenges of achieving SDG.\nSimilarly, as per the methodology applied by the\
    \ author in \n[23], the major challenges faced by Romania over achieving \nSDG\
    \ are the Socio economic discrepancy among the rural \ndwellers’ lives as well\
    \ as the Environmental incongruity.\nA few of the Sustainable Development challenges\
    \ faced \nby the Iranian Rural communities as per the authors [24] \nare economic\
    \ setbacks, improper management, and under-\nplanned developments, environmental\
    \ factors, social con-\ncerns, and infrastructural challenges were determined.\
    \ \nOverall implications of the studies provide us with a con-\ncise picture of\
    \ significant challenges of achieving sustainable \ndevelopment goals in rural\
    \ areas.\nSustainability and blockchain both are the call for the \nfuture to\
    \ reduce cost, increase productivity, improving \nhealth, better environmental\
    \ state, and availability of food, \nwater, and sanitation. Blockchain holds the\
    \ ability for long-\nterm and inclusive progress in sustainable development and\
    \ \nto achieve SDGs.\n1.1.3  Blockchain Technology\nIn 2008 when Satoshi Nakamoto\
    \ [25] (pseudonym) proposed \nBitcoin, its expansion was doubted. The rise of\
    \ Blockchain \nwas such unforeseen that some enthusiasts asserted it as the \n\
    biggest invention since the Internet [26]. Although W Scott \nStornetta and Stuart\
    \ Haber described the first cryptographi-\ncally secured chain of blocks in 1991,\
    \ it wasn’t until 2009 \nthat Blockchain was implemented as the public ledger\
    \ for \nbitcoin transactions by Nakamoto. For a substantial amount \nof time,\
    \ Blockchain technology was only preferred for a \ncryptocurrency (Fig. 3). However,\
    \ after the introduction of \nscripting language into the blocks by Ethereum Blockchain\
    \ \nto work as bonds, which are now known as Smart Contracts \nthe inventory of\
    \ applications widely opened. In his paper \nNakamoto proposed to create a peer-to-peer\
    \ form of elec-\ntronic cash that did not require a financial institution as an\
    \ \nintermediary and would be transferred directly between \none party and another.\
    \ He improved the double-spending \nFig. 2  Sustainable development \ngoals\n\

    \ \n1 3\nproblem in Digital Signatures by implementing timestamps \non the transaction\
    \ and hashing them onto the ongoing chain \nof hash-based proof-of-work which\
    \ changed the proof-of-\nwork if tampered with hence forming an immutable record.\n\
    Blockchain, even though it uses pseudonyms as account \nidentifiers, has four\
    \ key trust characteristics that eliminate \nthe need for third-party authenticators.\
    \ Firstly, a ledger in \nwhich after successful verification and authentication\
    \ the \ntransaction details are stored. Secondly, it is Secure since \nits transactions\
    \ are time-stamped and hashed to the previ-\nous blocks; it makes the blockchain\
    \ cryptographically secure \n(Fig. 4). Thirdly, the shared characteristic of involving\
    \ mul-\ntiple users provides transparency amongst all participants \nin the distributed\
    \ ledger. Lastly, its property of being dis-\ntributed eliminates operational\
    \ inefficiencies, provides more \nsecurity as the more the number of nodes the\
    \ more resilient \nit is towards attacks [27].\nThe complexity of the working\
    \ of blockchain can be \nsimplified by exploring the components that make up its\
    \ \narchitecture [28]. The main components can be enumer-\nated as Node, Cryptographic\
    \ hash functions, Transactions, \nAsymmetric-key cryptography, Ledgers, Blocks,\
    \ Miners, \nand Consensus (Fig. 5).\nNode: A device possibly a computer forming\
    \ the structure \nof a blockchain. A node is where the blockchain exists. Cop-\n\
    ies, as well as original records of the blockchain, are stored \nin a node. Classified\
    \ as Full node and Light nodes, where \nFull node is a server in a decentralized\
    \ network that contains \nthe Block chain’s block history, and Light nodes are\
    \ used for \nsimple payment verification such as a wallet that queries the \n\
    current status of a block.\nLedgers: A decentralized blockchain uses a ledger\
    \ for \nrecord-keeping. As it is decentralized, it keeps many copies \nof the\
    \ transaction including providing a copy to each user \nof their transaction.\n\
    Blocks: A block resembles a page in a record book \n(ledger). The first block\
    \ is called the generic block. A block \ncomprises a block header and block data\
    \ where the block \nheader consists of the history of the blockchain (previous\
    \ \nhash value, timestamp, size of the block, and nonce) and \nminers perform\
    \ hashing to validate the block, and block data \nkeeps the record of recent transactions\
    \ that are yet to enter \nthe blocks.\nCryptographic hash functions: A digest\
    \ or an algorithm \nthat takes up an arbitrary amount of data and produces a \n\
    hash value or hash which is an output of fixed size. It elimi-\nnates the use\
    \ of a password, instead uses enciphered text that \nprovides more security from\
    \ attackers.\nTransactions: A transaction is what the components work \nabout.\
    \ When two parties interact in blockchain, a transaction \ntakes place. Authorization\
    \ is required to approve a transac-\ntion between two parties. In a public blockchain,\
    \ the trans-\naction is inserted by consensus which happens when the \nmajority\
    \ of nodes validate the transaction.\nAsymmetric-key cryptography: It is public-key\
    \ cryptogra-\nphy that is used to enable certitude between the transacting \n\
    parties who are unsure about each other’s integrity. Asym-\nmetric-key cryptography\
    \ uses mathematically related keys to \nensure safety as well as the secrecy of\
    \ data. The public key \nand Private key, even though relative is used for decryption\
    \ \nand encryption, respectively.\nMiners: When two users create a transaction,\
    \ the miners \nvalidate that transaction in the block data before putting it \n\
    on the ledger. The average time it takes for a miner to mine a \nblock is 10 min.\
    \ Since miners use their energy and hardware \nto solve a block, they also require\
    \ an incentive for their work \nwhich is mostly paid in cryptocurrency.\nConsensus:\
    \ A consensus can be identified as a decision-\nmaking criterion. It makes sure\
    \ that all the nodes validate a \nblock and no such duplicity exists in the ledger\
    \ that hasn’t \nbeen agreed upon. The discussion involved in consensus is \nFig.\

    1 3\nused to solve identity-issue, clarify altercations, and estab-\nlish a similar\
    \ viewpoint between the participants by applying \na set of rules.\nEthereum:\
    \ introduced by Vitalik Buterin [29] addressed \nvarious limitations of the scripting\
    \ language in the block-\nchain. The platform is used to build and publish distributed\
    \ \napplications by using a programming language. It is said \nto be an improvement\
    \ over the blockchain structure. It pro-\nvides data-friendly services to all\
    \ and sundry no matter their \nlocation or background. Ethereum consists of full\
    \ nodes that \nrun the Ethereum Virtual machine to deploy distributed pro-\ngrams\
    \ such as smart contracts. Application development in \nblockchain can be done\
    \ through Ethereum which can also \ncall multiple other blockchain, protocols,\
    \ and cryptocurren-\ncies [30]. Ethereum uses the chain of global computers to\
    \ \noperate and runs smart contracts that are free of intermediar-\nies or third-party\
    \ censorships. Ethereum uses an incentive \nmechanism [31] to encourage programmers\
    \ who run the \nFig. 4  Blockchain technology diagram\n2423\nA Systematic Literature\

    \ to compensate for hardware and energy \nused in running decentralized digital\
    \ applications (dapps). \nThese incentives are called Ether which is a cryptocurrency\
    \ \nin the Ethereum protocol.\n1.1.4  Blockchain Development Platforms and Tools\n\
    To simplify the blockchain processes and to ease the devel-\nopment various tools\
    \ and programming languages have been \nintroduced.\n1.1.4.1 Ethereum Virtual\
    \ Machine (EVM) The executing \ncode and the Executing machine consist of an abstraction\
    \ \nwhich is referred to as virtual machines, and Ethereum vir-\ntual machines\
    \ increase the intended code execution chances, \nand the consensus is maintained\
    \ on it [32].\n1.1.4.2 Remix IDE Remix Integrated Development Envi-\nronment is\
    \ open-source software for web or desktop devel-\nopment. An intuitive and appealing\
    \ interface remix allows \nsmart contract development and Ethereum interaction\
    \ [33]. \nRemix IDE has multiple plugin options such as Web3 inte-\ngration, embedded\
    \ Web3, and Javascript for running the \ncontract locally. Solidity smart contract\
    \ programming lan-\nguage is used for development in Remix IDE.\n1.1.4.3 Smart\
    \ Contracts Simple programs stored on the \nblockchain comprise some predefined\
    \ conditions [34]. \nUpon meeting the conditions the contract is self-executed\
    \ \ngiving the edge of non-intermediary processes as well as \ntime efficiency.\
    \ Multiple programming languages are used \nto develop smart contracts for blockchain;\
    \ a few of them \nhave been discussed below:\n• Solidity [35]: A highly preferred\
    \ object-oriented design-\nbased, high-level language conveniently made for \n\
    developing smart contracts. Most of the solidity syntax \ninspiration came from\
    \ C ++ , Javascript, and Python pro-\ngramming languages. Solidity, along with\
    \ being the top \nsmart contract language focusing on EVM in certain also \nsupports\
    \ inheritance and user-defined types.\n• Vyper [36]: Highly influenced by python\
    \ and the sec-\nond-best after Solidity, vyper is based on three important \n\
    principles namely auditability to ensure the readability \nand understandability\
    \ of the code for the user, Security \nto ensure secure smart contracts, and Simplicity\
    \ of the \nlanguage and the implementation.\n• Yul [37]: An intermediate smart\
    \ contract development \nlanguage that includes the bytecode compilation accord-\n\
    ing to different backend needs. The main focuses of Yul \nare simplicity in bytecode\
    \ translation, understandability, \nand readability of the scripted programs.\
    \ Yul supports \nstack machines and is specifically tailored for them, \nwhole-program\
    \ optimization, and static type reference \nand value nature.\n1.1.4.4 Hyperledger\
    \ A Linux framework for blockchain \ndevelopment that provides standards and tools\
    \ for open-\nsource blockchain applications [38]. Hyperledger enterprise \nhelps\
    \ build permissioned blockchain solutions for busi-\nnesses and services. Under\
    \ the Hyperledger Framework, \nmultiple projects have been introduced:\n• Hyperledger\
    \ Fabric: A modular permissioned and private \nframework for blockchain technology\
    \ used for develop-\ning solutions for businesses and private enterprises. Fab-\n\
    ric has a well updated smart contract interaction, faster \ntransactions, and\
    \ efficient data sharing.\n• Hyperledger Explorer: Explorer is a user-friendly\
    \ block-\nchain development web application tool. The interface \nprovides detailed\
    \ information about the blocks, trans-\nactions, network nodes, and the state\
    \ of the blocks. \nHyperledger Explorer uses visualization tools for repre-\n\
    senting the blockchain data in a user-friendly and read-\nable manner.\n• Hyperledger\
    \ Sawtooth: By separating the core system, \nthat is, specifying the business\
    \ rules without interact-\ning with the application domain is the main task of\
    \ \nhyperledger sawtooth. It supports the Practical Byzantine \nFault Tolerance\
    \ (PBFT) as well as the Proof of Elapsed \nTime (POET). The smart contracts can\
    \ be developed and \nrun on the platform without actually knowing the core \n\
    system’s design.\nFig. 5  Blockchain components\n2424\n \nP. Kaur, A. Parashar\
    \ \n1 3\n• Hyperledger Caliper: A blockchain benchmark tool, the \ncaliper used\
    \ pre-defined uses cases to test the blockchain \nsolutions along with a test\
    \ result of its performance. Cali-\nper has a very proficient success rate for\
    \ testing the suc-\ncessful and failed transactions, provides the maximum, \n\
    minimum, and average latency of transaction and read \ndata for the test cycle.\n\
    Limitations of Blockchain are limited but cannot be disre-\ngarded [39]. From\
    \ the creation of the node to the validation \nby miners, Blockchain consumes\
    \ a lot of energy. Splitting of \nthe chain is another problem where a node does\
    \ not accept \nthe transactions in a new chain if it is operating to the old \n\
    software. The computing requirements increase as the block-\nchain grows. Since\
    \ all the nodes cannot provide the neces-\nsary capacity, the node breaks, and\
    \ the immutability and \ntransparency of the blockchain cease to exist.\n1.1.5\
    \  Blockchain for Smart Village Applications\nThe scenario in a typical village\
    \ is such, in terms of the \ninfrastructure most of it is inadequately built,\
    \ there exists \nschools and colleges but poorly maintained, poorly built \nhouses\
    \ with no constraints for disaster management. In \nterms of necessities, normal\
    \ villages lack stable electricity \nsupplies, or a secure income to support electricity\
    \ bills, and \nnon-purified water. People in villages are often neglected \nand\
    \ most of the dwellers don’t have any personal or national \nidentity. The healthcare\
    \ system in villages is simple and inef-\nficient which does not help during major\
    \ problems. Normal \nvillages lack any technological advancement and people \n\
    there live in history because of the lacking development. \nSustainable development\
    \ with the concept of smart villages \ncan give a secure and feasible future to\
    \ the villages.\nBeyond the conventional use of blockchain in finance \nusing\
    \ cryptocurrency, numerous applications can change the \nway we perceive digitization.\
    \ According to Kandaswamy \n[40], blockchain can have four types of initiatives:\
    \ block-\nchain disruptor, digital asset, efficiency play, and record-\nkeeper\
    \ (Fig. 6). With similar inventiveness some of the \nblockchain applications with\
    \ the concept of a smart village \ncan be enumerated as:\nHealthcare: Blockchain\
    \ with its record-keeping charac-\nteristics and smart contract with its privacy\
    \ and security has \ngreatly assisted the medical area by providing a solution\
    \ \nfor publicly or semi-private sharing of the medical data of \npatients. This\
    \ can help the researchers and students to elicit \na new solution or use it for\
    \ clinical trials [41]. The solution \nfor missing health documents or previous\
    \ clinic visit records \ncan be improved through blockchain. The potential of\
    \ Block-\nchain to store patient’s record on the ledger make it possible \nto\
    \ get treatment across the globe. Furthermore, the problem \nof counterfeit drugs\
    \ in the market can be resolved through \nthe traceability solution from blockchain\
    \ through which fake \nmedicines can be traced and removed from the supply chain.\n\
    International payments and insurance: Accelerated pay-\nment to international\
    \ locations is possible through block-\nchain technology. Several Bitcoin-operated\
    \ services make it \neasier to transfer money cross-border. The process includes\
    \ \nconverting the payer’s local currency into Bitcoin bypass-\ning the existing\
    \ banking infrastructure and then converting \nthat Bitcoin into the receiver’s\
    \ local currency. This saves the \ntrade cost and speeds up the transaction. Apart\
    \ from that, \nthe insurance industry can also be benefitted from block-\nchain\
    \ technology [42]. Blockchain can provide a transparent \nand trustworthy system\
    \ to overcome the challenges of the \ninsurance industry. Fraudulent claims, intermediary\
    \ payment \ntransactions, and big data handling are some of the many \nissues\
    \ faced by insurance companies. Blockchain can resolve \nthe issues through its\
    \ security and transparency provided by \nthe distributed ledger which also furnishes\
    \ the authentic-\nity of the participants. Besides, its characteristic of record-\n\
    keeping comes in handy with the huge amount of customer \ndata that is immutable\
    \ in the blockchain ledger. Additionally, \nby using the smart contracts real-time\
    \ data of the claims, \nreimbursements or payments can be fetched from multiple\
    \ \nsystems in no time.\nPersonal Identity Record-keeping: Identity is an integral\
    \ \npart of society that provides a unique character and sense \nof acceptability\
    \ in a country. However, physical forms of \nnational identity are not accessible\
    \ to many people around \nthe world. The absence of identity makes it difficult\
    \ for \npeople to participate in voting, banking, employment and \nlimits the\
    \ chances of access to the financial system. Here \nblockchain steps in by providing\
    \ identity solutions through \nFig. 6  Blockchain elements\n2425\nA Systematic\
    \ Literature Review of Blockchain Technology for Smart Villages \n1 3\ndigital\
    \ identity. Additionally, self-sovereign identity arranges \noptions to store\
    \ one's identity on devices accessible across \nthe world [43].\nSupply chain\
    \ and logistics: Blockchain can bring great \nusability to supply chain management.\
    \ Procurement, trace-\nability, digital payments, and logistics are some areas\
    \ that \nhave benefitted from blockchain technology. The distributed \nledger\
    \ can reduce the sharing of operational data by provid-\ning a full view of the\
    \ sale/purchase data, accessible from \nany device. Fraud in the food supply chain\
    \ is prevalent in \nmany countries. Counterfeit products selling in the market\
    \ \nprove hazardous to the consumer. The Block chain’s QR \ntracking system along\
    \ with digitized physical products can \nbe used to track products from production\
    \ to delivery [44]. \nThis technology has started benefiting the agricultural\
    \ sec-\ntor to develop food safety and smart farming increasing the \nincome of\
    \ small farms and food producers.\nEducation: Keeping physical records and transcripts\
    \ can \nbe a hassle. This blockchain provides a solution for digitiz-\ning student\
    \ records, transcripts, and payment receipts [45]. \nDigital record-keeping can\
    \ benefit a student as it will be \nacceptable by universities across the globe,\
    \ free of manipula-\ntion, and handy. Blockchain can also be used to incentivize\
    \ \nstudents through a course credit system. The credit can be \ntranslated to\
    \ cryptocurrency, which can be further used as \nfee payment.\nBlockchain with\
    \ the Internet of Things (IoT): Powerful \nunion of two futuristic technologies\
    \ makes machine-to-\nmachine transactions easier. The decentralized authority\
    \ \nof blockchain combined with the smart devices run by IoT \nallows a function\
    \ to autonomously execute without a central \nauthority [46]. Smart IoT run devices\
    \ can be implemented \non edge devices, reducing data transfer costs, and security\
    \ \nissues with the blockchain collaboration [47]. Blockchain \nintegration with\
    \ IoT can highly change the agricultural sec-\ntor. Supply chain traceability\
    \ could benefit the farmers in \neliminating the intermediaries through traceability\
    \ and RFID \ntag-based applications. Water, soil, climate, and other sen-\nsory-type\
    \ IoT devices can help in monitoring the agricultural \nactivities and gathering\
    \ the farm data and activities such as \ncultivation and livestock data in the\
    \ blockchain ledger. IoT \nwith blockchain will certainly revolutionize and transform\
    \ \nmany rural and urban sectors.\n1.2  Motivation and Major Contributions\nSustainable\
    \ Rural development starts with the participation \nof rural people in improving\
    \ their lifestyle. Without the peo-\nple working for their development, any implementation\
    \ or \nhelp is incomplete. Economic and technological sector links \nare important\
    \ for rural areas to develop. Along with that, a \nhealthy agricultural sector\
    \ improves the dweller’s linkage to \nthe global supply sector. By managing the\
    \ social, economic, \nenvironmental, and health objectives the development can\
    \ be \nfast-forwarded. There is a considerable amount of potential \nin rural\
    \ people which can be applied to employment issues, \nsocial disparities, E-governance,\
    \ women's rights etcetera. \nDeveloping rural areas can benefit nationally, economically,\
    \ \nand financially. This systematic literature review aims to pro-\nvide extensive\
    \ literature related to blockchain’s application \nin rural development and sustainable\
    \ living. A plethora of \nblockchain review papers available does not provide\
    \ a col-\nlective literature review of blockchain applications divided \ninto\
    \ different areas directed towards rural and sustainable \ndevelopment. Therefore,\
    \ clear and concise information can \nbe gained about blockchain’s work in improving\
    \ rural devel-\nopment providing scope for future research in this direction.\
    \ \nThe primary contributions are mentioned below:\n• A systematic review of relevant\
    \ literature for research \ntrends, key applications, and areas of implementing\
    \ \nBlockchain Technology for smart villages for sustain-\nable rural development.\n\
    • Identification of major issues in rural development and \nhow they can be addressed\
    \ using Blockchain Technology.\n• Exploration of the existing software, platforms,\
    \ and tools \nfor the implementation of Blockchain in Rural Develop-\nment.\n\
    • Identifications of the research gaps and future research \ndirections for applying\
    \ Blockchain Technology to Rural \nDevelopment.\nTo conduct a fair and precise\

    \ Review on Blockchain \nTechnology for Sustainable Rural \nDevelopment\nThe literature\
    \ review consists of the collective work of \nblockchain in rural development.\
    \ A total of 6 areas of \napplication were identified after careful extraction\
    \ of data \nand transformation globally namely: Agriculture, Bank-\ning, Environment,\
    \ Energy, Employment, and Healthcare. A \ndetailed discussion on the related work\
    \ is discussed in the \nsubsections.\n4.1  Agriculture\nIn the agriculture sector,\
    \ most of the application areas \nincluded supply chain traceability, facilitation\
    \ of smart agri-\nculture, and incentivization of services (Fig. 14). A detailed\
    \ \nsummary is given in Tables 5, 6, and 7.\n4.1.1  Supply Chain Traceability\n\
    The author F. Tian, [51] studied the integration of RFID \n(Radio-frequency Identification)\
    \ and blockchain technology \nin building the agri-food supply chain traceability\
    \ system. \nWith the help of blockchain technology, the information \nshared and\
    \ traceability is guaranteed. Apart from the sup-\nply chain, it also regulates\
    \ food safety and quality supervi-\nsion. This system can enhance the credibility\
    \ and reliabil-\nity of agri-food safety information. With the depletion of \n\
    an application cost, this system can effectively change the \ncurrent supply chain\
    \ to be more quality-enhanced and safe. \nSimilarly, Hua et al. proposed an agriculture\
    \ [65] provenance \nsystem based on blockchain featured by decentralization, \n\
    collective maintenance, consensus trust, and reliable data \nto solve the trust\
    \ crisis in the product supply chain. The \nsystem’s Target is to record information\
    \ related to the pro-\nduction supply chain: production, processing, storage,\
    \ trans-\nportation, and distribution of agricultural products. It also \nfacilitates\
    \ Recordkeeping from basic planting information \nto provenance records. The proposed\
    \ work solved the issue \nof the credibility of data and the difficulty of integrating\
    \ the \nsubsystem of each company.\nThe paper by Casado-Vara et al., [58] addressed\
    \ the issues \nof the current supply chain such as communication gaps \nbetween\
    \ vendors or the opacity of the origin of the product. \nThe author has proposed\
    \ a new model of the supply chain \nvia blockchain where all the members of the\
    \ supply chain \nsave all their transactions in the blockchain to ensure higher\
    \ \nsecurity. This model also enables a circular economy that \nis a make-use-recycle\
    \ model. With this model, all products \ncan be traced from their origin to their\
    \ sale and subsequent \nrecycling.\nFurther, Caro et al., [70] presented AgriBlockIoT\
    \ which \nis a fully decentralized blockchain-based traceability solu-\ntion for\
    \ agricultural food supply chain management. The \nproposed architecture based\
    \ on API includes a controller to \nconvert high-level function calls to corresponding\
    \ for the \nblockchain layer and blockchain itself which is the main \nFig. 10\

    blockchain can create transparent, fault-tolerant, immuta-\nble, and auditable\
    \ agri-food traceability records. The authors \nLi and Wang, [85] characterized\
    \ the research applications \nof blockchain in food supply traceability. With\
    \ the help of \nblockchain technology and various radiofrequency devices \ncan\
    \ be integrated to collect data from farms, deploy sensors, \nand create intelligent\
    \ contracts to implement server logic. \nThe new system can change the traditional\
    \ food supply sys-\ntem by making it more convenient, efficient, and trustable.\
    \ \nKim et al., [54] presented a theoretical, end-to-end, vis a vie \n“farm-to-fork”,\
    \ food traceability application named Harvest \nNetwork with the integration of\
    \ Blockchain technology and \nInternet-of-things. The process includes tracing\
    \ the prod-\nucts from processing, grading, transportation, temperature, \nand\
    \ contractual payment all with blockchain, IoT, and smart \ncontracts. This can\
    \ help consumers gain field-level insight \ninto the products. Lin et al., [63]\
    \ proposed an IoT and block-\nchain integrated self-organized, open, and ecological\

    \ \ninformation about the product they buy with the help of a \ntrusted, self-organized\
    \ smart agriculture ecosystem.\nGalvez et al., [78] review the potential of blockchain\
    \ tech-\nnology in guaranteeing traceability and authenticity in the \nfood supply\
    \ chain. The review included blockchain solutions \nto traceability problems.\
    \ It explained the use of a chronologi-\ncal distributed database to coordinate\
    \ individual activities. \nBy using a probabilistic approach to enable transparency\
    \ \nand verifiability without a central authority, enabling con-\nsensus on a\
    \ transaction to secure legitimate transactions, \nand time-stamped blocks providing\
    \ immutable records to \npreserve records the traceability issues were solved.\
    \ The \npaper also discussed the Block chain’s concept on the food \nsupply chain\
    \ which provides transparency, efficiency, secu-\nrity, and safety to the food\
    \ produce. According to Kamble \net al., [55], the supply chain practitioners\
    \ found a lack of \nefficiency and transparency which leads to constant threats\
    \ \nto formers and consumers. The system deployed the ISM \nmethodology to identify\
    \ Blockchain technology enablers \nin the agriculture supply chain. The findings\
    \ implied the \nacceptance of blockchain technology as an innovative tool to \n\
    ensure an efficient agriculture supply chain by the practition-\ners. To achieve\
    \ further traceability the farmers could cap-\nture relevant information about\
    \ the agricultural events onto \nthe blockchain to enable transparent and trusting\
    \ sources of \ninformation for the farmers. Kamilaris et al., [60] explored \n\
    how the food supply chain and agriculture were impacted \nby blockchain technology.\
    \ The stages of the supply chain \nwith blockchain technology has been identified\
    \ as (1) the \nprovider (2) producer, (3) processing, (4) distribution, (5) \n\
    retailer, and (6) consumer where a web application or device \ncan be used to\
    \ scan the item’s QR code to view its detailed \ninformation. Along with this,\
    \ the author explored various \nchallenges and benefits of the agricultural supply\
    \ chain \nand Blockchain’s collaboration. Salah et al., [66] proposed \na solution\
    \ of eliminating the third parties and centralized \nauthorities in the food supply\
    \ chain along with a security \nsystem for food traceability, transparent records,\
    \ and gov-\nernance of interactions and transactions between the users. \nThe\
    \ model entities are related to providing secure tracking \nof the product and\
    \ payment with Ethereum smart contracts. \nThus, the presented model for traceability\
    \ can be used to \ntrace and track the soybean supply chain. S. Missineo, [75]\
    \ \nproposed a model to secure storage origin provenance for \nfood data. The\
    \ proposed system aims to certify the produc-\ntion and the supply chain concerning\
    \ food local products \nby using Blockchain Technology and Smart Contracts. The\
    \ \nauthor aimed to ensure the authenticity of typical Sardinian \nproducts and\
    \ to sell them online or offline. The platform \nensured the consumer to check\
    \ the authenticity of the prod-\nuct before the purchase giving details on both\
    \ the production \nchain and supply chain. Jaiswal et al., [86] proposed mul-\n\
    tiple smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum blockchain \nfor decentralized\
    \ trading of food grains. The framework \nincluded Peer-to-peer trading, the security\
    \ of food grain \ndata, transparency, user anonymity, trust, and incentives as\
    \ \nkey features. The design of the framework consisted of four \ncontracts namely\
    \ food grain supply, bidding, trading, and \nutilization for the supply chain\
    \ management. Dong et al., \n[56] proposed a collaborative model of blockchain\
    \ and IoT \nin the agriculture sector. The data collection and transmis-\nsion\
    \ can be distinguished through a unique identity card \ngiven to each agricultural\
    \ product. All the environmental \naspects of the agricultural process can be\
    \ gathered at the \nsource. Along with that crop growth information, circulation\
    \ \nof the product using an RFID tag and distribution process \ncan also be recorded\
    \ and stored on the distributed ledger. \nA QR code attached to the product can\
    \ be scanned by the \nconsumer to view product information in details.\nFig. 14\

    \ \n1 3\nWithal, Madumidha et al., [145] proposed the use of \nblockchain technology\
    \ to maintain tamper-proof records, \navoid intermediaries and provide security\
    \ to the transac-\ntions which in turn reduces transaction costs and improves\
    \ \nthe quality of the products. The food products are labeled \nwith RFID tags\
    \ to maintain the supply chain. The author \nexplained the revolutionary changes\
    \ blockchain technology \ncan bring to the supply chains and how it can increase\
    \ the \neconomic conditions of a country by reducing corruption \nrates and increasing\
    \ the satisfaction of producers and con-\nsumers. Paul et al., [83] proposed a\
    \ way to eliminate inter-\nmediaries between farmers and consumers to provide\
    \ the \nright amount for the farm produce. The proposed system \nconsists of blockchain\
    \ nodes namely Supply companies, \nlandowners, markets, and farmers. The farmer\
    \ node sets the \namount after the agreement period, the market node collects\
    \ \nand stores crops and stops intermediaries from manipulating \nthe prices,\
    \ the landlord node collects the money from the \nland on lease, and the supply\
    \ company node sells extra agri-\ncultural products to the farmers. This platform\
    \ named KHET \nwhere all the nodes are interconnected through Ethereum \nblockchain\
    \ is beneficial for farmers, landlords, and markets.\nMusah et al., [62] main\
    \ objective in proposing the role of \nblockchain in Ghana’s cocoa beans food\
    \ supply chain was \nto evaluate the contributions made by applications of block-\n\
    chain technology in the supply chain. The system provides \na global traceability\
    \ platform, supply chain intelligence and \nvisibility, Africa cocoa village;\
    \ impact the investing for \nsmallholder farmer and uses Bean tracker. The author\
    \ care-\nfully studied the tools and platforms benefiting the cocoa \nbean production\
    \ and supply chain processes.\nAdditionally, Baralla et al., [146] proposed a\
    \ blockchain-\nbased generic agri-food supply chain traceability system \nfor\
    \ implementing the farm-to-fork model. In this system, \na QR code scan can allow\
    \ the consumer to reconstruct the \nproduct history to verify product health and\
    \ quality. The \nmain contribution of this article was the authentication and\
    \ \nverification of shared data’s integrity in supply chain man-\nagement. With\
    \ the help of this system, the involved operators \ncould identify any new participants\
    \ along with the supply \nchain which increased the degree of trust between organiza-\n\
    tions and individuals. Dakshayini et al., [87] proposed an \nintegrated model\
    \ based on Blockchain, big data, and cloud \nto efficiently manage crops that\
    \ achieve effective demand-\nbased decision support, simplified, transparent,\
    \ and secure \nagricultural supply chain. The proposed model has a higher \npercentile\
    \ of achieving demand and supply of crops which \navoids the farmer’s loss, catering\
    \ to consumer’s needs, pro-\nvides sustainable agricultural practices, reducing\
    \ middlemen \ninvolvement, and reducing price inflation problems. Saji \net al.,\
    \ [88] proposed a model to enhance the supply chain \nperformance by using a blockchain\

    \ Villages \n1 3\nnew markets. The system improved farming profitability \nand\
    \ endorsed the financial stability of cultivators. It also \nprovided health benefits,\
    \ reduced food wastage, eliminated \nmanipulation, and adulteration, and supports\
    \ the supply \nchain of agro-products. Saurabh and Dey, [69] identified the \n\
    potential divers of blockchain concerning the grape wine \nsupply chain. The smart\
    \ contract-based module was con-\nstructed to ensure trust between participants\
    \ during trans-\nactions. The proposed model enhanced the customization, \ncompetitiveness,\
    \ and usability of the supply chain.\nIqbal and Butt, [84] proposed a model to\
    \ save the farm-\ner’s crops from animals at night. A repelling and notifying\
    \ \nsystem (RNS) is installed in the field that receives signals \nduring an animal\
    \ attack. Human-safe ultrasonic waves are \nproduced by this RNS which drives\
    \ the animals away. This \nproposal also consists of a farm management system\
    \ that \nreceives the report regarding the hazards caused in the fields. \nThis\
    \ system enabled timely data delivery, efficient multi-hop \ncommunication, dependable\
    \ data transmission, and low-cost \ntechnology. Chun-Ting et al., [73] proposed\
    \ a blockchain-\nbased agricultural traceability service platform for tamper-\n\
    proof data storing and backup. The system design consists of \nData collecting\
    \ layer where IoT sensors collect environmen-\ntal data, the blockchain layer\
    \ takes data from the formal layer \nand sends them to blockchain nodes and later\
    \ to blocks, and \nthe application layer handles the requests to access transac-\n\
    tion data based on the transaction hash. Hegde et al., [81] \npresented different\
    \ ways of implementing blockchain with \nthe agricultural supply chain. With the\
    \ use of blockchain, the \nproducers can get data and income security, and keep\
    \ track \nof environmental changes that affect the crops. The trace-\nability\
    \ option provides clarity in any damage that occurred \nto the product and an\
    \ overall increase in efficiency can be \nachieved by producing only required\
    \ products hence reduc-\ning wastage. Peña et al., [89] presented a systematic\
    \ review \non blockchain in food supply chain management in Ecua-\ndor. According\
    \ to the review, most of the work was done in \nHyperledger composer, models for\
    \ business interactions and \nhuman interactions, Traceability, Security, and\
    \ Blockchain \nInformation.\nAdditionally, M. Kumarathunga, [57] after reviewing\
    \ \npresented the way to reduce transaction costs and improve \nfarmer’s involvement\
    \ in agricultural supply chains. To \nreduce transaction costs farmers can participate\
    \ in Infor-\nmation sharing, goal congruence, decision synchronization, \nincentive\
    \ alignment, resource sharing, collaborative commu-\nnication, joint knowledge\
    \ creation. Xu et al., [80] reviewed \nthe working principle of blockchain technology\
    \ in the agri-\nfood sector. Blockchain technology provided data transpar-\nency,\
    \ data traceability, food safety, and quality monitoring, \nand agriculture finance.\
    \ Additionally, food safety and qual-\nity can be secured by digitizing products.\
    \ According to the \nreview, blockchain revealed a better approach to the future\
    \ \nof the agri-food supply chain which is safer, healthier, sus-\ntainable, and\
    \ reliable. Mirabelli and Solina, [71] collected \nand analyzed the applications\
    \ of blockchain technology and \nits contribution to agricultural food traceability\
    \ issues. The \nreview showed that the usability of blockchain technol-\nogy in\
    \ the agricultural sector was still in the early stage. \nThe review highlighted\
    \ three main aspects namely starting \nproblem, area of interest, and contribution.\
    \ Blockchain can \nbe a valid way to minimize fraud and errors in agricultural\
    \ \nsupply chains by increasing the quality and safety of food \nproducts. Shahid\
    \ et al., [53] have proposed a complete solu-\ntion to the blockchain-based agricultural\
    \ and food supply \nchain. The paper aimed to provide an end-to-end solution \n\
    to the growing blockchain-based agri-food supply chains. \nFurther, it achieved\
    \ the following properties: accountability, \ncredibility, auditability, autonomy,\
    \ and authenticity. The sys-\ntem also acted as a better alternative to the existing\
    \ supply \nchain system by enabling a scalable and auditable system. \nAwan et al.,\
    \ [79] proposed a smart agricultural model as a \ntransformation to the traditional\
    \ agricultural supply chain. \nThe system consists of Seed seller, Farmer, Crop\
    \ buyer, \nProcessor, Crop storage, Distributor, Retailer, Customer. \nTo improve\
    \ the food supply chain’s productivity and reli-\nability the smart model was\
    \ proposed. The model allowed \nfarmers to enter and monitor the data in the plant.\
    \ The main \nobjective of this model was to provide equal opportunities to \n\
    the participants of the agricultural food supply chain. The-\njaswini and Ranjitha,\
    \ [64] proposed a model that explores \nthe problems faced by people in agriculture\
    \ production and \nits solutions based on blockchain technology. Blockchain \n\
    solutions for traceability of crops, disclosure of data, clarity \nin food production,\
    \ and authentic agricultural products was \nproposed by the author. This proposed\
    \ model ensured food \nsafety, benefitted farmers, and stakeholders.\nYadav et al.,\
    \ [67] reviewed the blockchain adoption bar-\nriers in the Indian agricultural\
    \ supply chain. The barriers \ncan be enumerated as Lack of proper government\
    \ regulation \nand regularity uncertainty, Huge resource, and initial capital\
    \ \nrequirement, security and privacy concerns, lack of interop-\nerability and\
    \ standardization, etc. Further, the barriers were \nmodeled using an integrated\
    \ ISM-DEMATEL approach \nwhich provided limited interpretative logic. W. Lin,\
    \ [59] \nprovided a survey to study the techniques and applications \nof blockchain\
    \ technology. The application categories of \nblockchain in agriculture are Provenance\
    \ traceability and \nfood authentication, smart farming data management, trade\
    \ \nfinance in the supply chain management, and other informa-\ntion management\
    \ systems. The paper also indicated possible \nfuture developments and applications\
    \ of blockchain. Dutta \net al., [61] reviewed articles related to blockchain\
    \ technol-\nogy’s integration with various supply chain operations. The \nbenefits\
    \ of Blockchain in supply chains can be enumer-\nated as Data management, Improvement\
    \ in transparency, \n2444\n \nP. Kaur, A. Parashar \n1 3\nImprovement in response\
    \ time smart contract management, \nOperational efficiency, and Disintermediation,\

    \ the main supply chain functions were identified \nas supply chain provenance,\
    \ supply chain resilience, supply \nchain re-engineering, security enhancement,\
    \ business pro-\ncess management, and product management. The work also \nexamined\
    \ various challenges and impacts of blockchain in \nthe supply chain. Shahid et al.,\
    \ [77] proposed a solution for \na blockchain-based reputation system in the agriculture\
    \ and \nfood supply chain. The system model consisted of invoking \nsmart contracts\
    \ to provide reviews based on the services to \nthe providers. The reviews are\
    \ requested by buyers and the \nsellers’ review the transactions and perform other\
    \ transac-\ntions based on that. The system was proposed to maintain \nthe immutability\
    \ and integrity of the registered review. \nTorky and Hassanein, [82] presented\
    \ a comprehensive sur-\nvey on IoT and blockchain and their importance in devel-\n\
    oping smart applications. According to the review, crops \noverseeing, livestock\
    \ grazing, and food supply chain are a \nfew subsectors in precision agriculture\
    \ managed by block-\nchain platforms. Apart from that, a novel blockchain model\
    \ \nwas also proposed to use as an important solution for major \nchallenges in\
    \ IoT-based precision agricultural systems. The \nobjectives of Skender and Zaninović,\
    \ [74] in their paper \nwere to analyze blockchain technology’s overall perspec-\n\
    tive, investigate its potential in a sustainable supply chain \nto replace the\
    \ shortcomings in the traditional supply chain. \nThe traceability and transparency\
    \ in the agricultural supply \nchain can be improved with blockchain.\nTo better\
    \ understand the benefits and challenges and the \nperspective for sustainable\
    \ blockchain, the author provided \na conceptual framework. Borah et al., [68]\
    \ proposed a novel \nblockchain-based Farmer and Rely called FARMAR. The \nsystem\
    \ could provide fair prices and reduce duping by mid-\ndlemen. The assets can\
    \ be traced from farmers to consumers, \nreducing the artificial inflation of\
    \ prices. Ferrag et al., (2020) \n[76] reviewed the research challenges on IoT-based\
    \ agricul-\nture and its security and privacy issues. The rest of the paper \n\
    identified threat models against green IoT-based agriculture \nanalyzed the privacy-oriented\
    \ blockchain-based solutions \nand consensus algorithms for green IoT-based agriculture.\
    \ \nEnescu and Ionescu, [52] proposed a model for farmers in \nthe agri-food sector\
    \ using blockchain. This system ensures a \ncredible supply chain for producers\
    \ and consumers, guaran-\nteed timely payments between the participants. The authors\
    \ \nproposed this system to provide transparency, security, and \ntrust in the\
    \ trading process. Chaudhari et al., [90] proposed \na framework for a secure\
    \ and transparent supply chain with \nthe help of blockchain technology. With\
    \ the help of this sys-\ntem, the farmers can get a fair price for their products.\
    \ This \ntransparent and tamper-proof supply chain system generates \na bill at\
    \ the end including the commissioning price as well as \nthe total price after\
    \ sold product hence benefiting the farm-\ners in knowing the selling and market\
    \ price. Xie et al., [91] \nproposed to construct a traceability framework For\
    \ fresh \nE-commerce agricultural product quality and safety based \non blockchain\
    \ technology. To access the key control points \nthe author used the FMECA (failure\
    \ model effect and key \nanalysis) to analyze the failure mode, impact, and hazards\
    \ \nin the traceability chain. This system can promote agricul-\ntural development\
    \ through decentralization, consensus trust, \nmaintenance, and reliable database\
    \ features.\nFurthermore, Li et al., [92] proposed a blockchain-based \nTraceability\
    \ of the fresh food supply chain With the help of \nbusiness process reengineering\
    \ (BPR). The overall traceabil-\nity architecture is based on key links’ product\
    \ quality data \nand participants’ transactions. The objective of this trace-\n\
    ability system was to ensure data integrity. Flores et al., [93] \nproposed a\
    \ model for decentralization of data and provide \ntraceability of agricultural\
    \ products with blockchain tech-\nnology. Using this method could guarantee transparency\
    \ of \nthe supply chain and other operations as well as the transac-\ntions involved.\
    \ Fernandez et al., [94] proposed a Blockchain-\nbased model to improve farmer’s\
    \ profits. The author aimed \nto improve the output primitives of the supply chain.\
    \ Farmer-\nto-consumer product tracking and cost were the main factors \nin improving\
    \ traceability in the supply chain. Cortez-Zaga \net al., [95] proposed a model\
    \ used in the Peruvian agricul-\ntural sector using blockchain. When using blockchain\
    \ it can \neliminate dependence on a central entity, provides integrity \nof the\
    \ process, transactions become irrevocable, secure, \nand private, and provides\
    \ transparency and immutability. \nG. Zhao, [96] presented a systematic literature\
    \ review that \nexplored the advances in the agri-food supply chain. The \npaper\
    \ also pointed out the challenge of the applications of \nblockchain technology\
    \ enumerated as storage capacity and \nscalability, privacy leakage, high-cost\
    \ problem, regulation \nproblem, throughput and latency issues, and lack of skills.\n\
    Land record maintenance using blockchain was also \nproposed by Bhorshetti et al.,\
    \ for easy maintenance of land \nrecords in real-time. The database proved to\
    \ be a non-failure \nsystem and the work provided intermediary-less land title\
    \ \ntransfer and processing between owners. This system pro-\nvided security,\
    \ transparency, and a broker-free land man-\nagement system [97]. The paper by\
    \ Thakur et al. presented \nthe issues related to land records maintenance, registration,\
    \ \nsettlements, and banks. The system ensured better land man-\nagement, lesser\
    \ fraudulent transactions while strengthening \nthe sustainable development goals\
    \ (SDG) and increasing the \nGDP of the country [98].\n4.1.2  Agriculture Security\
    \ System\nTse et al., [102] proposed food supply information security \nbased\
    \ on blockchain technology. The use of blockchain in \n2445\nA Systematic Literature\
    \ Review of Blockchain Technology for Smart Villages \n1 3\nthis system can regain\
    \ the people’s trust in the food mar-\nket, the government can collect statistics\
    \ on various kinds \nof food, and adulterated and fake food in the market can\
    \ \nbe eliminated. This type of technology can benefit the cus-\ntomer, manufacturers,\
    \ and supervision departments of the \nfood supply chain. Wu and Tsai, [103] proposed\
    \ an intel-\nligent agriculture network security system by applying dark \nweb\
    \ technology to monitor packet transmission frequency in \norder to prevent DDOS\
    \ attacks. The system applied a dark-\nnet mechanism to identify anyone who attempts\
    \ to access \nblockchain data. It also incorporated IoT sensors to gather \ndata\
    \ regarding temperature, humidity, and soil. This model \nwas proposed to keep\
    \ track of the farms and cultivation fac-\ntors related to an environment and\
    \ to establish network secu-\nrity for IoT networks.\n4.1.3  Organic Farming\n\
    Reddy and Kumar, [101] presented the article based on the \nsustainability of\
    \ the food supply chain. The author's objec-\ntive was to achieve Fair Trading\
    \ and a circular economy with \nthe help of blockchain technology. With this framework,\
    \ the \nfollowing results but achieved: Automatic hashing for less \nelectricity\
    \ consumption, product malfunctioning and add \nalteration, the involvement of\
    \ middlemen, availability of \nfarming jobs, and facilitating development and\
    \ unity among \nfarmers. According to Basnayake and Rajapakse, [104], the \npurpose\
    \ of the research was to implement a Blockchain-\nbased solution to verify food\
    \ quality. The process included \nFarmers issuing a product contract to control\
    \ the quality of \neach product. For each deployment of the product contract,\
    \ \nit would return an address that was used to generate the QR \ncode to identify\
    \ the physical product. Lastly, Consumers \nwere also eligible to rate the product\
    \ quality to ensure trust.\n4.1.4  Smart Agriculture\nTo overcome remote monitoring\
    \ challenges and provide \nsecurity and privacy in agriculture, Patil et al.,\
    \ [105] pro-\nposed a lightweight architecture for smart greenhouse farm-\ning.\
    \ The model consisted of four groups showing the integra-\ntion of blockchain\
    \ with IoT namely (1) smart greenhouse, (2) \noverlay network, (3) Cloud storage,\
    \ and (4) End-user. This \nmodel can be used to successfully monitor the secure\
    \ trans-\nmission of greenhouse data. Umamaheshwari et al., [106] \nproposed a\
    \ model for Buying and selling crops and land. \nThe model used Ethers as a cryptocurrency.\
    \ According to \nthe paper, the recordkeeping of crops grown in the land was \n\
    useful to know the history of plantations in the land. With \nthe help of this\
    \ model, users were able to access real-time \ndata about crops, eliminate the\
    \ need for middlemen, and \nestablish a transparent and efficient system. Voutos\
    \ et al., \n[107] proposed the integration of IoT and smart contracts \nto develop\
    \ smart agriculture to deliver higher quality agri-\ncultural products. It also\
    \ focuses on improving the associ-\nated supply chain and logistics benefiting\
    \ the participants \ninvolved. The author discussed the factors of smart agri-\n\
    culture as soil factors, climate, sensors, research, supply \nchain, storage,\
    \ analytics, and smart contracts. Miloudi et al., \n[100] proposed IoT, Blockchain,\
    \ and Geospatial technology-\nbased Smart farming to manage the farming practices\
    \ more \nsmartly and sustainably. The system proposed smart farming \nmanagement\
    \ in 4 stages namely (1) Integrated blockchain \nwith IoT platform where various\
    \ IoT sensors apply analytics \nand sends data to the blockchain, (2) Blockchain\
    \ Working \nMethodology where data visibility is provided through smart \ncontracts,\
    \ (3) Integrating GIS with blockchain where the \ndata sent from IoT sensors are\
    \ improvised and accuracy is \nfacilitated through GIS geospatial tools, and (4)\
    \ certifying \nfarmers in blockchain stage facilitates authorities and privi-\n\
    leges to the farmers through smart contracts which could \ngreatly benefit farmers\
    \ and food production industry.\nFurthermore, Devi Et al., [108] Proposed a design\
    \ archi-\ntecture by merging IoT and BC for smart agriculture. The \nnodes involved\
    \ in the blockchain received the information \nfrom the sensors that were connected\
    \ to the things involved \nin the Smart Agriculture monitoring process. The design\
    \ \narchitecture enhanced the security and data transparency \nperformance of\
    \ smart agriculture. Vangala et al., [109] \nreviewed blockchain technology and\
    \ its information security \nschemes. The application areas covered by the authors\
    \ were \nagriculture monitoring, controlled agriculture/smart green-\nhouses,\
    \ food supply chain tracking, and precision farming/\nsmart farming. The review\
    \ also presented a thorough analy-\nsis of the security attributes, application\
    \ areas, advantages, \ndrawbacks, and competing schemes’ cost of computation \n\
    and communication. Branco et al., [110] proposed a con-\nceptual approach with\
    \ the integration of IoT and blockchain \nfor a mushroom farm distribution process\
    \ control system. \nThe proposed system allowed the collection of distributed\
    \ \ndata on the environmental factors contributing to mushroom \nproduction providing\
    \ collection, storage, and processing of \nmushroom farm data to be scalable,\
    \ immutable, transparent, \nauditable, and secure.\n4.1.5  Dairy Farming\nMisra\
    \ and Das, [111] presented a conceptual framework \nusing blockchain to bring\
    \ feasibility and efficiency in \nE-governance. The architecture consisted of\
    \ a service-\noriented architecture framework to store details of stake-\nholders\
    \ involved in user services on demand, a blockchain \narchitecture that would\
    \ allow stakeholders to authenticate \nand perform transactions on the ledger,\
    \ and digital identity \narchitecture to act as a regulator in the architecture.\
    \ With \na dairy farmer as a user or participant in the architecture \n2446\n\
    \ \nP. Kaur, A. Parashar \n1 3\nwho would benefit from the transactions while\
    \ having vot-\ning rights and leadership entities in the system the author \n\
    conceptually explored the prototype of the dairy coopera-\ntive sector in India.\
    \ Similarly, Rambim and Awuor, [112] \nproposed a model for dairy farmers in Kenya\
    \ that explores \nthe potential use of blockchain technology in milk delivery\
    \ \nin rural areas. From the Naitiri Dairy farmers’ cooperative \n(NADAFA) in\
    \ Kenya, the author introduced a Milk Deliv-\nery Blockchain Manager (MDBM) which\
    \ is a decentralized \nplatform to automatically capture the quantity and quality\
    \ \nof milk delivered by the farmers. The delivery data stored \nin the blockchain\
    \ is immutable, cryptographically hashed, \nand digitally signed. The details\
    \ of delivery are accessible \nto the farmers. The NADAFA facilitates the system\
    \ and pro-\nvides payment to the dairy farmers on time. The consortium-\nbased\
    \ network provides leveraging blockchain solutions for \nfarmers.\n4.1.6  Livestock\n\
    Under Livestock monitoring, Alonso et al., [113] worked on \nimportant trends\
    \ in the applications of IoT and edge comput-\ning paradigms in the smart farming\
    \ field. This helps produc-\ners to optimize processes, provides the origin of\
    \ the product, \nand guarantees the quality to its consumers. The state of \n\
    dairy cattle and feed grain can be monitored in real-time by \nusing artificial\
    \ intelligence and blockchain technology. This \nis to ensure the traceability\
    \ and sustainability of different \nprocesses of farming. The implementation of\
    \ smart farm-\ning contributed to the reduction of data traffic and reliable \n\
    communications between IoT-Edge layers and the Cloud. \nAccording to Hang et al.,\
    \ [114], the uncertain data qual-\nity of analysts’ data can be solved through\
    \ blockchain. The \nproposed structure brings scalability, off-chain storage,\
    \ pri-\nvacy, and high throughput as advancement to the previous \nversion. Various\
    \ IoT data is fetched from fish farms such \nas temperature, water level, oxygen,\
    \ and PH data. The data \nstorage can be a database or cloud and end-user can\
    \ view \nthe fish farm’s detailed information through smart devices. \nLeme et al.,\
    \ [147] proposed a novel infrastructure based on \nthe integration of cloud storage\
    \ and blockchain technology \nto monitor the overall health of livestock. The\
    \ components \nof the architecture can be named as (1) Administrator, (2) \nUsers,\
    \ (3) Cloud service, and (4) blockchain network. With \nthe help of RFID tags\
    \ attached to the cattle, various entities \ncan be monitored to ensure that cattle\
    \ go through necessary \nprocedures. Yang et al., [115] proposed a novel method\
    \ to \nensure traceability and authenticity in the livestock supply \nchain using\
    \ blockchain. The model uses RFID-sensor-based \nlivestock monitoring in the food\
    \ industry where the sen-\nsors augment the physical tracking and solved the RFID’s\
    \ \ninherent computational capacity limitation by using cloud \nservices. The\
    \ data is then made accessible to the end con-\nsumer through Block chain’s transparent\
    \ ledger.\n4.1.7  E‑Agriculture\nThe analysis proposed by Li et al., [116] Investigated\
    \ the \nconvenience of sustainable electronic agriculture based on \nBlockchain\
    \ technology and analyzed the application likeli-\nhood and challenges of Blockchain\
    \ in the agricultural field. \nThe authors selected 5 villages with similar development\
    \ \nrates in china and Blockchain technology was applied using \ndata statistics\
    \ to the sustainable e-agriculture for exploring \nits convenience. Results showed\
    \ that sustainable electronic \nagriculture based on Blockchain Technology brought\
    \ great \nconvenience to the farmer’s sales, increasing by 25% on \naverage compared\
    \ with traditional electronic agriculture. \nSong et al. [117], to improve the\
    \ biased point of view, higher \ninitial costs, and lack of transparency and trust\
    \ proposed a \nsystem for providing sustainability in the current agri-food \n\
    supply chain. The paper discussed blockchain adoption in \nrural areas and relative\
    \ energy consumption from supply and \ndemand perspectives.\n4.1.8  Agriculture\
    \ Monitoring\nArshad et al., [99] proposed a private blockchain-based \nsecure\
    \ access control for agriculture to monitor climatic \nparameters. Private Blockchain\
    \ access control (PBAC) was \nused to guarantee secure communications where a\
    \ user usu-\nally goes through initialization, authentication, and revo-\ncation.\
    \ The farms monitoring system consists of the login \nphase, system setup phase,\
    \ user/farm professional registra-\ntion phase, password authentication and session\
    \ key agree-\nment phase, update or change phase, and addition of node \nphase.\
    \ The whole system stores access records and lessen \nthe computational and communication\
    \ overhead. Forbye, \nN. Bore, [118] proposed a model to improve the shortcom-\n\
    ings of existing digitized farming models through the AG-\nWallet System (AGWS).\
    \ The AGWS design consisted of (1) \ndigitizing the far demand–supply, (2) The\
    \ farm information \npipeline was to ensure secure storage and validate events\
    \ \nreceived from IoT, and (3) data analytic services that make \nthe information\
    \ visible to the participants. The system pro-\nposed by Osmanoglu et al., [119]\
    \ uses a blockchain-based \nyield estimation solution. Farmers can share the farming\
    \ \nplans for the upcoming harvesting season with other par-\nticipants, or learn\
    \ from other’s plans to review their plans. \nSmart contracts can be employed\
    \ by participants to share \ntheir yield commitments. The author improvised a\
    \ censor-\nship-resistant, tamper-proof, and immutable public ledger of \ntime-stamped\
    \ transactions.\n2447\nA Systematic Literature Review of Blockchain Technology\
    \ for Smart Villages \n1 3\n4.1.9  Farmers\nTalreja et al., (2020) [121] proposed\
    \ a farmer’s portal with \nthe help of blockchain technology and python to preserve\
    \ the \ncontract of trade between farmers and consumers. The farm-\ner’s portal\
    \ is a way to access farm activities. The proposed \nwork enhanced the degree\
    \ of participation, reduced inter-\nmediary cost, simplified process, provided\
    \ ease of selling \ncrops, and greater efficiency. The immutability of blockchain\
    \ \ntechnology fortified farmers for getting a fair price for their \ncrops and\
    \ reduced operational costs. Abraham and Kumar, \n[120] proposed a blockchain-based\
    \ data security system to \npreserve farmer’s data. The proposed work was based\
    \ on a \nprivate-permissioned blockchain for controlled participation, \nhyper\
    \ ledger fabric to support smart contracts, and system \ndesign to safely store\
    \ farm data. The widened blockchain \ndata helps farmer’s data to be accessed\
    \ by other participants \nwhich can allow the government to sanction schemes based\
    \ \non farmer’s data. Topart et al., [122] proposed an interoper-\nable ecosystem\
    \ of farmer’s consent management. The model \nused a permissioned blockchain to\
    \ allow only a specific \ngroup of people to access the services. The immutability\
    \ of \nconsent allows the data to be non-manipulative, distributed, \nsigned transactions,\
    \ and transparent. The consent verifica-\ntion for each data allows only valid\
    \ users to request data. \nThe model was proposed to respect the privacy, security,\
    \ \ntransparency, and consent of the farmer’s data.\n4.1.10  Incentivization\n\
    Blockchain has been using incentive mechanisms since bit-\ncoin to incentivize\
    \ miners, but recently many authors have \npresented ways of promoting work for\
    \ a reward. Incentives \nto promote sustainable agricultural practices by Giaffreda\
    \ \net al., [123]. Objectives include savings and increasing \nmarket value plus\
    \ monitoring the use of water in the fields. \nFarmers have been relying on satellite\
    \ data as it is a cheap \nsource of agricultural services. With the use of LPWAN\
    \ net-\nworks, accuracy in fields is increased along with a tensiom-\neter-a sensing\
    \ unit that is used to wirelessly communicate \nthe data related to the humidity\
    \ of the soil and a mini-meteo \nstation that is used to measure temperature,\
    \ air humidity, and \nair pressure. Smart contracts record the transactions from\
    \ the \ncalculated results in the cloud and release the incentives to \nthe farmer\
    \ according to their deal with the stakeholder. The \nproposal includes EnvCoins\
    \ as the incentives, which can be \nfurther used to buy technologies for sustainable\
    \ agricultural \npractices, for cash, or investment. Esmaeilian et al., [124]\
    \ \nproposed an incentive mechanism for green behavior such \nas waste disposal,\
    \ using re-furbished products, purchasing \nenergy-efficient products, saving\
    \ energy, recover, repair, \nand maintain. The tokens gained from sustainable\
    \ behav-\nior can be further used to access services on blockchain. \nIncentivization\
    \ can ameliorate some of the environmental \nissues in rural areas with the help\
    \ of rural people by moti-\nvating them to clean the areas. OpenLitterMap by S.\
    \ Lynch, \n[125] uses geospatial analysis to geotag various types of \nlitter.\
    \ It uses LitterCoins as an incentive mechanism for the \nproof of work. This\
    \ is to motivate people to submit correct \ndata. It also rewards for uploading\
    \ litter images from a new \nlocation. Apart from plastic and other homogenous\
    \ litter, a \nproposal to eliminate solid waste from small municipalities \nin\
    \ return for a reward is given by França et al., [148]. The \nprovision was to\
    \ change the original system from attack risk, \ndata loss, power outage, and\
    \ other such problems. The new \ndigitized system proves to be a handier as it\
    \ is in the form of \na mobile application. The reward for selling solid waste\
    \ to \nthe collecting agent is in Green Coins, a cryptocurrency sent \nto the\
    \ seller’s virtual wallet. This initiative led to comput-\nerization gains, information\
    \ integrity, and the use of crypto-\ncurrency. Additionally, in [128] D. Zhang,\
    \ worked on a simi-\nlar solution to efficiently use rural waste in incentivizing\
    \ \nrural people. The process includes the installation of smart \nbins and when\
    \ they are full, the collection trucks will swap \nthe waste for a digital coupon\
    \ which the farmer can use to \neither get agricultural products from the waste\
    \ to the energy \nplant or cash them. Blockchain makes it an easier process to\
    \ \ntransfer and record data faster with maximum transparency. \nOther applications\
    \ of incentives for waste include Recereum, \nSwachhCoin, Plastic Bank, 4New,\
    \ and OILSC [129].\nThe motivational incentive mechanism can also transform \n\
    the way medical data is shared for research and diagnosis. In \nthe paper by Zhu\
    \ et al., [126], the authors gave a solution to \nactuate people into sharing\
    \ medical data by providing them \nrewards for doing so. The rewards system is\
    \ based on the \naccess provided by the owner of the medical file. Through \n\
    Smart contracts, a trusted payment money flow can be \ndevised between the third\
    \ party and the owner. The Shapley \nvalue was considered for the revenue distribution\
    \ of medi-\ncal data sharing and to study the impact of consensus on \nthe miner’s\
    \ income. Furthermore, an incentive mechanism \nfor the accident alert system,\
    \ proposed by Devi and Pamila, \n[127] is another blockchain-based medical application.\
    \ \nAccording to the authors, most of the accidents occurs near \nrural places\
    \ where medical help is unreachable on time. To \neliminate the privacy issue\
    \ of the nearby user who receives \nthe accident report, a blockchain-based incentive\
    \ method \nis implemented for the user who receives the accident alert \nto send\
    \ the location of the victim to a close-by emergency \nservice. Then the message\
    \ initiator gets rewarded incen-\ntives for alerting about the accident. A similar\
    \ report system \nmobile application for anonymous reporting is proposed by \n\
    Zou et al., [130] in which reporting any incident can earn \npeople rewards. The\
    \ design goal of the author was to imple-\nment an anonymous report system, to\
    \ provide privacy to the \nperson who reports, without having to give their personal\
    \ \n2448\n \nP. Kaur, A. Parashar \n1 3\ninformation to the system. This model\
    \ induces incentive \nnamed Rcoins to whoever published the report information,\
    \ \nthe repliers, and the consenting miners. The Blockchain and \nKudos by Sharples\
    \ and Dominigue, [131], a reward-based \npermanent solution as the digital record-keeping\
    \ model. The \nauthor proposed the use of blockchain to store digital certifi-\n\
    cates, achievements, and credits. Stored as a public record \nit can be accessed\
    \ by the institutions or the student online. \nThe model uses Kudos an educational\
    \ reputation currency \nas a reward. The reward can be earned through uploading\
    \ \ncertificates on the blockchain, passing a test, or on course \ncompletion.\
    \ Another application of blockchain-based incen-\ntive system is EduCTX by Turkanović\
    \ et al., [132] which \nis proposed to globally enable the higher education credit\
    \ \nplatform. For potential stakeholders such as educational \ninstitutions, companies,\
    \ and organizations a unified view \nof student’s higher education credits and\
    \ grading system \nis placed on the global ledger through blockchain. ECTX \n\
    tokens will be credited based on the completion of courses \nwhich will act as\
    \ proof of completed courses.\n4.2  Environment\nIn the environment sector, the\
    \ most emphasis was given \non blockchain applications in Natural hazards, Water,\
    \ and \nWaste management in rural areas (Fig. 15). A detailed sum-\nmary is given\
    \ in Table 8.\n4.2.1  Waste Management\nFrom the articles proposed, in D. Zhang,\
    \ [128] the author \nworked on a similar solution to efficiently use rural waste\
    \ \nin incentivizing rural people. This framework is based on \nChina’s Yitong\
    \ system which is waste to energy plant for \nagricultural waste and the use of\
    \ blockchain to provide digi-\ntal coupons or cryptocurrency in return for waste.\
    \ The author \nproposed the use of a web application to use a QR code \nscanner\
    \ when the waste is collected from a smart bin, also \nencouraging segregation\
    \ of agricultural waste and residential \nwaste. The serves receive the weight\
    \ of waste, lodges it on \nthe global ledger, and the coupon is rewarded based\
    \ on the \nweight. Apart from plastic and other homogenous litter, a \nproposal\
    \ to eliminate solid waste from small municipali-\nties in return for a reward\
    \ is given by França et al., [148]. \nThe provision was to change the original\
    \ system from attack \nrisk, data loss, power outage, and other such problems.\
    \ The \nnew digitized system proves to be a handier as it is in the \nform of\
    \ a mobile application. The reward for selling solid \nwaste to the collecting\
    \ agent is in Green Coins, a cryptocur-\nrency sent to the seller’s virtual wallet.\
    \ This initiative led to \ncomputerization gains, information integrity, and the\
    \ use of \ncrypto-currency.\nLatif et al., [133] have addressed the smart waste\
    \ manage-\nment system with the integration of IoT and blockchain. The \nproposed\
    \ model included identification of waste material, \ntrace location, send to trash,\
    \ categorize waste, transfer waste, \nrecycling, and decision-making process.\
    \ The sensor nodes \nin the model were used for waste identification, and adding\
    \ \nnew blocks and the admin and waste management offices \nwere responsible for\
    \ collecting, executing recycling, and \ndelivering products. The recyclable wastes\
    \ are transformed \ninto useful products and share with the customers and send\
    \ \nthe non-recyclable wastes to the trash.\nFig.15  Blockchain applications \n\

    \ smart contracts execute the claims to the farm-\ners. Deployment of the system\
    \ can ensure water supply in \nrural areas and accessibility of insurance in case\
    \ of droughts \nor floods.\n4.2.3  Water Management\nThe intelligent smart watering\
    \ system proposed by Munir \net al., [135] is a blockchain-based system for the\
    \ smart \nconsumption of water. The system uses IoT for capturing \nreal-time\
    \ environment conditions such as soil moisture \nlevel, light intensity, air humidity,\
    \ and air temperature. The \nmain focus of the proposed system was to develop\
    \ a healthy \necosystem while efficiently using water in plantations and \ngardening.\
    \ Forbye, A water control system to efficiently \nmanage and coordinate the use\
    \ of water in irrigation com-\nmunities is proposed by Bordel et al., [136]. The\
    \ prosumer \nenvironment in the model is composed of a rule definition \nmodule\
    \ where users can create irrigation recipes using ECA \n(Event-Condition-Action)\
    \ rules. These rules are executable \nand easily transformed into other programming\
    \ languages. \nInputs are taken by a transformation engine, to create, com-\n\
    pile, and deploy a set of Smart Contracts coding all the irri-\ngation and management\
    \ logic. Finally, irrigation recipes are \nexecuted by an execution engine, which\
    \ invokes deployed \nSmart Contracts to interact with the infrastructure. From\
    \ \nthe perspective of Dogo et al., [137] proposed convergence \nof IoT and Blockchain.\
    \ Objectives of smart water solutions \ninclude smart measuring and monitoring\
    \ across the water \ndistribution, enhanced security, better analysis of the gener-\n\
    ated data, and enhanced revenue and efficiency.\nSimilarly, Hassija et al., [138]\
    \ proposed a drone-mounted \nbase station in the tactile internet environment\
    \ based on \nblockchain. The drone-mounted small cell station was based \non a\
    \ Permissioned peer-to-peer blockchain. To take strategic \ndecisions, a game\
    \ theory model was deployed. The deci-\nsion was based on user association; transmit\
    \ power level, \ndrone speed, and altitude. Additionally, smart contracts can\
    \ \nadd parameters and conditions based on requirements. The \nmodel’s results\
    \ showed that the low network areas can expe-\nrience better bandwidth with the\
    \ proposed system.\nFurther, the proposed model by Pincheira et al., [139] pre-\n\
    sented a trustless water management system-based software \narchitecture. The\
    \ system proposed presented a decentralized \nwater management system that could\
    \ incentivize virtuous \nbehavior in agricultural practices. Smart contracts were\
    \ used \nfor their intermediary-less characteristic. The authors also \nimplemented\
    \ a cross-platform software library to allow con-\nstrained devices to interact\
    \ with blockchain directly. The \nFig. 16  Blockchain applications \nin Smart\

    Enescu et al., [140] proposed a study on the use of photovol-\ntaic energy. The\
    \ paper showed the use of photovoltaic panels \nto power a power plant for the\
    \ improvement of abandoned \nland. According to the authors, photovoltaic panels\
    \ can eas-\nily pump water and is a more appropriate use of solar energy. \nBlockchain\
    \ can help reduce the intermediary distributors \nhence making the selling and\
    \ buying of energy more profit-\nable. Additionally, Kulkarni and Kulkarni, [141],\
    \ consider-\ning the lack of electricity in rural India, proposed a model to \n\
    solve rural electrification problems. The model introduces \npeer-to-peer energy\
    \ trading through blockchain suitable for \nsmall and remote micro-grids. A reliable\
    \ and profitable elec-\ntricity supply can be obtained through micro-grids. Smart\
    \ \ncontract-based meters allow transparency in the daily usage \nof energy used\

    4.3.2  Renewable Energy\nLevi-Oguike et al., [142] have presented the challenges\

    \ energy efficiency as an advancement to the sub-\nSaharan Africa environment.\
    \ In the case study performed \nby the authors, the following factors affected\
    \ its use to a \nlarge extent in sub-Saharan Africa: Employment and edu-\ncation,\
    \ displacement and resettlement, financing the tech-\nnology, regulatory provisions,\

    4.4  Banking\nIn the banking sector, most of the solutions were about \nissues\
    \ in banking availability in rural areas, loan sanctions \nto under-documented\
    \ people, and methods of transferring \nmoney (Fig. 17). A detailed summary is\
    \ given in Table 10.\n4.4.1  Loan\nGuo et al., [151] proposed a novel poverty\
    \ alleviation loan \nmanagement called the Loan On Blockchain (LoC). In the \n\
    LoC, the participating roles can be named as the Financial \ndepartment to check\
    \ the identity and application informa-\ntion of the participants, bank to provide\
    \ loan to the cus-\ntomer, Customer to provide identity and apply for loan, civil\
    \ \naffairs department to audit the customer identity and loan \napplications,\
    \ Regulator to monitor fund flow and inspect \nledger. This digital account model\
    \ was proposed for decen-\ntralized and centralized transfer of assets. Similarly,\
    \ Jain \net al., [152] presented a solution named Bit-score for credit \nscoring\
    \ for underprivileged (rural) people with the help of \nblockchain. The authors’\
    \ model used a self-sovereign model \nfor identity, distributed ledger storage,\
    \ credit score calcula-\ntion without any extra charges, and non-financial factor\
    \ for \nacquiring credit score. With bit-score being an improvisation \nover traditional\
    \ credit scoring techniques it makes the \ntransactions more transparent, decentralized,\
    \ secure, and \nintermediary-free.\n4.4.2  Mobile Money\nY. Hu, [150] proposed\
    \ a blockchain-based digital payment \nsystem to deliver reliable services on\
    \ unreliable network \nservices in rural areas. The system management contract\
    \ \nto record account types, user balances to avoid forks dur-\ning disconnection\
    \ with the help of smart contracts. True \ntransparency can be obtained through\
    \ digitization and eco-\nnomic growth can be boosted in poor countries. Ghatpande\
    \ \net al., [149] proposed a way of moving Secure, interoperable \nmobile money\
    \ in sub-Saharan Africa (SIGMMA) to sup-\nport semi-offline payments through blockchain.\
    \ The model \nprovides unreachable areas a monetary transaction solution \nwithout\
    \ having to provide any identity proof while ensuring \ntrust between parties\
    \ along with not having to physically \nvisit any bank.\n4.4.3  Cash Transfer\n\
    Another proposal is to provide banking solutions to rural \nareas where a chit\
    \ fund system has been designed by Kumar \nand Sangal, [154]. Chit fund being\
    \ a traditional saving \nscheme in India is an easier way to have access to credit.\
    \ The \npurpose of this system is to remove geographical barriers \nFig. 18  Blockchain\

    \ Unlike other anonymous blockchain applica-\ntions, this system requires identity\
    \ registration. Unlike tradi-\ntional co-lateral systems, blockchain generates\
    \ credit history \nto prohibit manipulation. Lastly, Jaffer et al., [153] proposed\
    \ \na blockchain-based distributed system that is immutable and \nsecures the\
    \ transaction logs. The self-executing smart con-\ntracts were used to automatically\
    \ execute real-world con-\ntracts for auto disbursement of subsidies on meeting\
    \ spe-\ncific conditions. This system overcoming traditional cash \ntransfers,\
    \ and corruption and manipulation related to it can \nbenefit rural or deserving\
    \ people.\n4.5  Healthcare\nIn the healthcare sector, smart healthcare systems,\
    \ telemedi-\ncine, and privacy in medical data sharing to provide security \n\
    and transparency in the healthcare system between doctors \nand patients were\
    \ the commonly addressed areas in related \nwork (Fig. 18). A detailed summary\
    \ is given in Table 11.\n4.5.1  Medical Data\nKaur et al., [157] proposed a blockchain-based\
    \ electronic \nmedical record storage and management system. The pro-\nposed model\
    \ consisted of three main components: Domain \nexperts (doctors, lab technicians,\
    \ pharmacists, and drug \nmanufacturers), health insurance providers, and patients.\
    \ To \nensure the privacy of medical data which contains most of \nthe private\
    \ information blockchain distributed data storage \nfor heterogeneous data was\
    \ proposed having a single source \nfor data storage and access while providing\
    \ high security \nand privacy to the users and researchers. Similarly, Zhang \n\
    et al., [158] proposed secure and scalable clinical data shar-\ning using FHIR\
    \ Chain, a blockchain-based system meeting \nONC (office of the national coordinator\
    \ for health informa-\ntion technology) requirements. The technical requirements\
    \ \nfor blockchain-based clinical data sharing were verifying \nidentity and authenticating\
    \ all participants, Storing and \nexchanging data securely, consistent Permissioned\
    \ access \nto data sources, applying consistent data formats, maintain-\ning modularity.\
    \ FHIRChain facilitates clinical data exchange \nwhile maintaining ownership.\n\
    4.5.2  Telemedicine\nGuo et al., [161] proposed an ABE scheme to achieve \ndynamic\
    \ authentication and authorization with higher flex-\nibility and efficiency for\
    \ the Medical on Demand services \nin the telemedicine system. The system uses\
    \ a Consor-\ntium Blockchain managed by multiple authorities. Medi-\ncal examinations\
    \ are uploaded to the database provided \nby Cloud Service Provider (CSP). The\
    \ medical results are \ndownloadable from Cloud only by Medical specialists. All\
    \ \nthe data is stored in Blocks of Blockchain hence prevent-\ning any manipulation\
    \ in health records. Through this system \nindependence of choice should be provided\
    \ to the patient \nwhether they want to enroll, leave, or change access poli-\n\
    cies. Nusrat et al., [160] proposed a model of a telemedicine \nsystem for medical\
    \ care and security of data of rural people \nby using blockchain technology.\
    \ The system consisted of sta-\ntions for primary treatment tests while storing\
    \ data directly \nin the blockchain. This system ensured communication and \n\
    data privacy to doctors and patients while also giving reli-\nable medical care\
    \ and benefits to underserved (rural) people.\nForbye, Yong et al., [159] have\
    \ proposed a blockchain \nand machine learning system for vaccine supply chain\
    \ trace-\nability. The novel intelligent system based on the blockchain \ncan\
    \ be used for vaccine supervision in the vaccine supply \nchain. Additionally,\
    \ using smart contracts for the vaccine \nsupply chain can provide the following\
    \ advantages: detection \nof expired vaccines, vaccine information, and vaccine\
    \ coin.\n4.5.3  Smart Healthcare System\nMachine Learning holds the power to change\
    \ the perception \nof understanding and analyzing data and decision-making in\
    \ \nmultifarious sectors. Since, the blockchain with its decen-\ntralized network\
    \ focus on secure data sharing, its integration \nwith machine learning would\
    \ provide a very meticulous out-\ncome. Few of the ways through which blockchain’s\
    \ integra-\ntion with machine learning and benefit the healthcare system \nare\
    \ [162]:\n(a) Blockchain ledger with legitimate data collection can \nfeed the\
    \ machine learning models with highly accurate \nand dependable data.\n(b) Real\
    \ data can be used to train machine learning models \nto increase efficiency and\
    \ precision, therefore, saving \ncost and time.\n(c) Models can be trained to\
    \ give the same health advice \nto multiple patients with alike symptoms.\n(d)\
    \ Models can also be trained to give better clinical solu-\ntions to doctors based\
    \ on the patient’s symptoms.\n(e) Training the models on the patient history and\
    \ storing \nthem on blockchain ledger can predict outbreaks.\nFor implementing\
    \ the integration, Jain et al., [156] pro-\nposed an integrated model of blockchain\
    \ and machine learn-\ning to detect diseases. These models can be implemented\
    \ \nin a hospital or rural medical camps. The proposed system \nconsisted of IoT,\
    \ blockchain, cybersecurity, and machine \nlearning. Various components measure\
    \ basic parameters of \nthe human body such as weight, pulse, blood pressure,\
    \ and \nautomatically saved the data in the ledger. The system has \nthe potential\
    \ to expand medical parameters while making it \n2456\n \nP. Kaur, A. Parashar\
    \ \n1 3\nadaptive. The complete system can collect, store, and ana-\nlyze the\
    \ data of the patient and benefit the doctors, patients, \nand medical institutions.\n\
    Similarly, Tripathi et al., [155] have proposed a safe and \nconvenient use of\
    \ medical data and its user through block-\nchain technology. The proposed work\
    \ is an improvement \non issues and challenges faced regarding security and pri-\n\
    vacy. The clinical data are recorded in the blockchain ledger \nwith access to\
    \ legitimate users only. For a doctor to access \na patient’s data a request has\
    \ to be made and only when \nthe patient approves the request does the data become\
    \ vis-\nible. The goal of this model is to provide secure and reliable \nservices\
    \ to insurance companies, drug supply chains, and \nmedical researchers. Lastly.\n\
    4.6  Employment\nThis application area mainly focused on employment vis-\nibility\
    \ and temporary employment for rural job security \n(Fig. 19). Therefore, the\
    \ following related research articles \nwere identified and a detailed summary\
    \ is given in Table 12.\n4.6.1  Temporary Employment\nPinna and Ibba, [163] proposed\
    \ a decentralized employment \nsystem to process employment contracts with a fully\
    \ auto-\nmated and fast procedure. The model consists of a new job \noffer event\
    \ in which awaiting employers apply for jobs, an \napplication event where a smart\
    \ contract acquires the appli-\ncation request, a hiring event where the applicant\
    \ worker \nmeets the employer, a relationship event to enable the work-\ners to\
    \ check working situation and details, the workday event \nwhich describes the\
    \ maturation of workdays, a payment \nevent where the employee gets paid. The\
    \ transparent ledger \ncan make sure that the employment contracts were deployed\
    \ \nwith unchangeable information.\n4.6.2  Employment Visibility\nSimilarly, the\
    \ paper’s proposal by M. et al., [164] ensures \nsupply chain visibility to seamlessly\
    \ connect all stakeholders \nof the supply chain network who are a part of the\
    \ Blockchain \necosystem. The paper defined two modules in BC design: the \nSupply\
    \ module and the demand module. Supply module to \ncollect worker's data and smart\
    \ contracts to perform transac-\ntions through an application interface and store\
    \ them on the \nledger. Demand module to implement job allocation. The \naggregators\
    \ are given direct access to help track worker’s \ninformation from the ledger.\n\
    4.7  Existing Systematic Literature Reviews\nA tabular representation of a few\
    \ major existing works of \nblockchain in rural development has been done in Table 13.\
    \ \nThis table communicates the area of literature reviews, and \ntheir main contributions\
    \ in the review regarding blockchain \nin rural or agriculture.\nAn extensive\
    \ literature review was done in this section \nwhich portrayed the enormous amount\
    \ of work done in \nblockchain technology pertaining to rural development. All\
    \ \nthe functional areas and sub-areas were compared and dis-\ncussed in tabular\
    \ form. Multiple novel ideas and theories \nwere identified during the literature\
    \ review. At last, a small \ntabular representation was made for the existing\
    \ systematic \nliterature reviews and surveys in a similar area to identify the\
    \ \ndepth of the work done. In the upcoming sections, critical \nanalysis and\
    \ detailed discussion have been done based on \nthe literature study, followed\
    \ by the limitations of the survey \nand conclusion.\nFig. 19  Blockchain applications\

    \ for Smart Villages \n1 3\n5  Critical Analysis Existing Technologies \nand Discussion\n\
    Blockchain Technology possesses much competence and \nfuturistic hold towards\
    \ rural development. In this review, \nall possible applications of blockchain\
    \ that facilitated rural \ndevelopment were found, reviewed, compared, and summa-\n\
    rized. With Agriculture being the predominant application \nof blockchain, various\
    \ areas under it were analyzed that \nworked on the relief of agricultural issues\
    \ in rural areas.\nStarting with Supply chain traceability, the study showed \n\
    integration of blockchain technology with Internet of Things \n[51, 54, 56, 58,\
    \ 63, 64, 69, 70, 73, 76, 82, 84, 85, 89, 100, \n145], Cloud computing [65, 87],\
    \ Big Data [87], and Geo-\nspatial Technology [100]. Among the papers discussed,\
    \ this \narea consisted of papers pertinent to tracing agricultural \nproduce\
    \ from the beginning of the process till it reached \nthe consumer. The range\
    \ of traceability options comprised \nall agricultural products as well as specifically\
    \ certain prod-\nucts such as soybean [60], grape wine [69], and cocoa beans \n\
    [62]. Furthermore, blockchain’s integration with IoT pro-\nvided sensing and sharing\
    \ of private data with blockchain \nwithout intermediary support. Additionally,\
    \ some proposed \nwork used QR codes [56, 60, 146] for viewing data directly \n\
    related to the attached product. Articles supporting IoT \ndevices were implemented\
    \ for tracing agricultural produce, \nencouraging circular economy, fault-tolerant,\
    \ and immutable \nAPIs. A few were reviews on agriculture traceability [53, \n\
    58, 60, 61] barriers [67], challenges [59, 71, 76] contribu-\ntion [80], IoT based\
    \ solutions, and future scopes [78, 96]. \nSome agricultural prototypes included\
    \ AgriBlockIoT [70], \nKHET [83], and FARMAR [68]. A few land record manage-\n\
    ment articles were also discussed that implied security and \nbroker-free methods\
    \ for land titling and transferring [97, 98]. \nMost of the platforms used were\
    \ Ethereum Smart Contracts, \nHyperledger, REST, JavaScript (Web3, node, angular),\
    \ Truf-\nfle Framework APIs, and MySQL and MongoDB for cloud \nstorage.\nWhile\
    \ traceability of agricultural produce is important, \nthe agriculture security\
    \ system is also a necessity. In this \nreview, the articles for agriculture security\
    \ systems included \nprevention of farm data from cyber-attacks using IoT [103]\
    \ \nand supervision of agricultural products and food informa-\ntion [102]. In\
    \ both the works acquired, it used Smart con-\ntracts and Ethereum Blockchain\
    \ respectively, along with \nIoT-based sensors for farm monitoring.\nOrganic Farming\
    \ as a part of agriculture application for \nsustainable farming and quality food\
    \ production included \ntwo articles for analyzing the effectiveness of supply\
    \ chain \n[101], and identifying product quality and transparency of \norganic\
    \ food supply chain using decentralized applications \nand QR codes for tracing\
    \ product data [104].\nTable 12  Comparison of blockchain applications in Employment\n\

    Furthermore, using smart methods to enhance the agri-\ncultural process was discusses\
    \ in the smart agriculture \nSect. 3.1.4 where farm controlling, recordkeeping,\
    \ improved \nlogistics, farm managing and improvising, and monitoring \nusing\
    \ Blockchain Technology and IoT [106–110] as well \nas cloud computing [105] and\
    \ geospatial technology [100] \nin some articles were covered. Most emphases were\
    \ given \ntowards improving the quality of farming and its man-\nagement while\
    \ providing utmost security to data. Mostly \nused platforms to implement the\
    \ proposed work were \nJavaScript(Node, Ganache, Truffle), Ethereum Smart Con-\n\
    tracts, and IoT-based sensors.\nApart from the supply chain in farming, the dairy\
    \ sector \nwas one of the application areas covered in the review com-\nprising\
    \ of E-governance in the dairy sector implemented on \nsmart contracts [111],\
    \ and quality and quantity assurance \nof milk with a delivery platform [112]\
    \ using Blockchain \nTechnology. In addition to the dairy sector, blockchain appli-\n\
    cations in livestock management using Blockchain Technol-\nogy [114], IoT and\
    \ Cloud Computing [113, 115, 147] to \nmonitor livestock, observe cattle using\
    \ RFID tags, storing \ndetailed information on fishes, along with livestock trace-\n\
    ability were discussed in the review. Integration with IoT \nprovided real-time\
    \ monitoring and traceability of livestock \nand its by-products in the supply\
    \ chain.\nSimilarly, to share informative farming data and tech-\nniques a review\
    \ on convenience analysis of the blockchain \nin agriculture [116], and exploratory\
    \ data planning and \nmanagement of agricultural food supply chain for sustain-\n\
    able development [117] was given to explore the work done \nin E-agriculture using\
    \ blockchain technology. Since one \nof the main motives towards implementing\
    \ blockchain in \nagriculture is to monitor the faring process and products \n\
    till it reaches the consumer, therefore, agriculture monitor-\ning section covered\
    \ farm monitoring system[99], a yield \nestimation system to share farming plans\
    \ implemented on \nsmart contracts [119], and an IoT based AG Wallet system to\
    \ \ntrack farm activity implemented using IBM enterprise block-\nchain platform\
    \ [118]. Penultimately, the application area was \ndivided into farmer Sect. 3.1.9\
    \ where blockchain’s reviews \nto facilitate farmers such as farmer’s portal to\
    \ capture farm \nactivities using HTML and Python [121], farmer’s data stor-\n\
    age to provide transparency for government scheme using \nsmart contracts [120],\
    \ and farmer’s data accessing using \ntheir consent [122] were discussed.\nLastly,\
    \ an overall blockchain application area covering the \nuse of incentives for\
    \ numerous activities was discussed in \nSect. 3.1.10. The review included a reward-based\
    \ system in \nreturn for solid waste [148], rural waste [128], anonymously \n\
    reporting an activity [130], reporting an accident [127], stor-\ning educational\
    \ records in ledger [132], green behavior [123, \n124], geotagging litters [125],\
    \ and to safely share medical \ndata [126]. The incentive mechanism works when\
    \ an activ-\nity is performed, therefore in return for good behaviors or \nactivity,\
    \ cryptocurrency-based tokens are rewarded that can \nbe stored in a blockchain\
    \ wallet. Most of the platforms used \nwere smart contracts while some of the\
    \ systems also used \nARK Blockchain, Laravel PHP, and JavaScript.\nLooking through\
    \ the applications of blockchain in rural \nareas, usage of blockchain in reinforcing\
    \ environmental \nconditions and changing people's outlook on preserving the \n\
    environment was the outcome of factors affecting rural peo-\nple as they were\
    \ much likely also related to environmental \nconditions. From this view, the\
    \ environmental application \nareas were discovered and discussed to be Water\
    \ manage-\nment, Waste management, and Natural hazards.\nTo begin with, under\
    \ Sect. 3.2.3 water management, \nsmart measuring and monitoring [137], smart\
    \ consump-\ntion [135], management [139], and control system [136] \nof water\

    \ system in return for waste collection and selling \n[128, 148], and waste management\
    \ [133] using Blockchain \nTechnology were discussed. Covered under the integration\
    \ \nof Blockchain Technology, Cloud Computing, and IoT, the \nimplementation used\
    \ smart contracts in the first two propos-\nals and UML, TLA + for the latter.\n\
    Lastly, as per the research criteria, only one article con-\ntributing to the\
    \ environment and natural hazards was dis-\ncovered and reviewed explaining the\
    \ insurance system for \ndrought-affected farms based on the farm data stored\
    \ in the \nblockchain ledger [134]. The model was implemented on \nNEO virtual\
    \ machine, smart contracts, and used Oracle \nserver as database.\nSimilarly,\
    \ from the challenges faced by rural people \nacquiring an electric line, energy-efficient\
    \ methods, to \nsecure, and transparent payments issues were covered and \nreviewed\
    \ under the energy section. The blockchain applica-\ntion areas in the energy\
    \ sector were discovered to be Renew-\nable energy and the Energy grid. With blockchain’s\
    \ integra-\ntion with renewable energy a smart contract-based energy \ntransfer\
    \ credibility system of biomass energy grid [143], \nand a case study of sub-Saharan\
    \ Africa and its challenges \nand adoption of renewable energy access were discussed\
    \ \n[142]. Whereas in the energy grid section, the blockchain’s \napplication\
    \ in providing peer-to-peer electrification with \nsecure payments, transparent\
    \ energy usage [144], and the \nuse of smart energy grids for farming and irrigation\
    \ using \nEthereum Blockchain [140] were reviewed.\nBesides, from the traditional\
    \ use of blockchain in Finance, \nthe banking solutions for rural people were\
    \ discussed in \nSect. 3.4. From the banking applications of blockchain, the \n\
    use of mobile money for semi-offline payments in sub-Saha-\nran Africa without\
    \ identity proof using a secure, interoper-\nable mobile money system [149], and\
    \ a delay-tolerant digital \npayment system based on Ethereum blockchain [150]\
    \ were \ndiscussed. A simpler way of getting a loan with the help \nof blockchain\
    \ is by using a hyper ledger fabric-based Loan \nOn Blockchain(LOC) system using\
    \ smart contracts [151], \nand a credit scoring system called Bit-score using\
    \ Ethereum \nBlockchain [152] were discussed. Finally, a Cash Transfer \narea\
    \ where a distributed system for automatic subsidy deliv-\nery and fund release\
    \ using JavaScript and Hyperledger com-\nposer [153], and a chit fund system based\
    \ on smart contracts \nto provide credit to rural people [154] were reviewed.\n\
    Under the Healthcare applications of blockchain, A Smart \nHealthcare System,\
    \ Medical Data sharing, and Telemedi-\ncine were the areas discovered. Under smart\
    \ healthcare, the \narticles reviewed were a smart model to detect diseases and\
    \ \nmeasure basic health parameters using Ethereum blockchain \nand Raspberry\
    \ Pi [156] and protected access to medical \ndata using smart contracts [155].\
    \ For the recordkeeping of \nmedical data and share it legitimately an electronic\
    \ medi-\ncal record storage management system based on ethereum \nand cloud storage\
    \ [157], and a permissioned clinical data \nsharing called FHIRChain using smart\
    \ contracts [158] was \nreviewed. Lastly, under Telemedicine, vaccine supervision\
    \ \nand traceability for safe vaccine supply [159], secure data \nstorage using\
    \ telemedicine system based on smart contracts \n[160], and a telemedicine system\
    \ to prevent health records \nmanipulation using Blockchain and Cloud Database\
    \ [161] \nwere the articles reviewed.\nAnother challenge faced by rural people\
    \ implemented to \nrecuperate from unemployment using blockchain technol-\nogy\
    \ was discussed in Sect. 3.6. Using smart contracts an \nemployment contracts\
    \ processing, handling, and safe pay-\nment system for temporary employment contracts\
    \ [163], and \na blockchain aggregator to perform worker data transactions \n\
    and employment visibility [164] were the works reviewed \nin this section.\n5.1\
    \  Limitations of Existing Works and Research \nGaps\nIn this section, the limitations\
    \ of the existing literature \nreview on blockchain in rural development along\
    \ with \na comparison of existing systematic literature reviews \nhave been discussed.\
    \ The comparison has been shown in \nTable 14, and a few research gaps have been\
    \ mentioned in \nthis section as well.\nWhile Blockchain technology is leading\
    \ in security and \ntransparency, providing ways of applying its technology in\
    \ \ndisparate areas its limitations and gaps can still be identi-\nfied in the\
    \ proposed and implemented work. While most \nof the work in agriculture is for\
    \ ensuring transparency and \ntraceability in the supply chain, there are far\
    \ more factors in \nagriculture that affect farmers and crops. Blockchain inevi-\n\
    tably uses excessive energy in execution, but its execution in \nrural areas may\
    \ become worrisome due to the lack of energy \nand load in those areas.\nCollecting\
    \ farm data and storing them on the ledger in \nsmall farms is easier. However,\
    \ in the case of big farms, the \ndata collection and integration may consume\
    \ much time and \nprobably manpower in accumulating and loading it in the \nledger.\
    \ Apart from that, IoT-based services require sensors \nas well as collecting\
    \ livestock DNA to trace them and load \ntheir information may cost a fortune\
    \ to small-scale farmers.\nTeaching the application usage to laymen, that too\
    \ unedu-\ncated farmers or rural people may become a troubling task. \nNot only\
    \ that, the availability of news of the latest technolo-\ngies is hardly accessible\
    \ to underdeveloped countries, intro-\nducing blockchain-based applications to\
    \ those areas may toil \nthe deployment and utilization.\n2460\n \nP. Kaur, A. Parashar\

    \ while \nmaking blockchain transactions. A lost private key or a mis-\ntakenly\
    \ added extra digit to the payment can cause irrevers-\nible damage.\nThereafter,\
    \ a data breach of medical data and inappro-\npriate access to medical histories\
    \ are some issues that may \ndecrease people’s trust in the blockchain-based healthcare\
    \ \nsystem for medical data privacy.\nSecurity threat is another limitation that\
    \ can affect any \ntype of application that requires recordkeeping. Here the \n\
    blockchain’s main characteristics may itself prove faulty to \nfind the intruder\
    \ as it gives total anonymity to users. With \nboth pros and cons, robust and\
    \ reliable technology can still \nbe deployed for many usages, making livability\
    \ easier and \npeople technologically advanced.\n5.2  Discussion\nMultiple issues\
    \ pertaining to rural areas have been addressed \nby authors with the help of\
    \ blockchain. Agriculture is the \nmost economic factor, solutions for blockchain-based\
    \ sup-\nply chain traceability provided secure, transparent, beneficial \nproduct\
    \ delivery. It also ensured timely payments to farm-\ners and quality products\
    \ to consumers. Banking solutions \nhave also been made easier with blockchain\
    \ technology, pro-\nviding remote banking solutions, credit and loan easiness,\
    \ \nand easy and transparent banking. Hygiene issues that led \nto many diseases,\
    \ generational disabilities have also been \ngiven a solution through blockchain\
    \ which also incentivizes \nrural people for participating in waste and water\
    \ manage-\nment. Rural electrification solutions were also proposed with \nblockchain\
    \ for people unable to obtain energy resources, \nbasic electrical amenities,\
    \ and expensive bills. People who \nwere unable to receive treatments, had to\
    \ travel long dis-\ntances for medical assistance, were also provided a block-\n\
    chain solution with which telemedicine, privacy to medical \ndata usage, and medical-on-demand\
    \ were made available. \nBlockchain has also been useful in providing employment\
    \ \nsolutions to the truly underserved, using a global chain \nfor employment\
    \ visibility, and secure payment for jobs \n[168–172].\nThe Systematic Literature\
    \ Review’s objective is to pro-\nvide information on the research proposed related\
    \ to block-\nchain in rural development to provide new research oppor-\ntunities,\
    \ extensive knowledge about each development area, \nand the possibility for future\
    \ development in rural areas. \nAfter distinctly reviewing every research article\
    \ variant areas \nof applications were identified relating to the development\
    \ of \nFig. 20  Blockchain Applications and their Areas in rural development\n\
    2462\n \nP. Kaur, A. Parashar \n1 3\nrural areas with the help of Blockchain Technology.\
    \ Overall, \n6 disparate applications in rural development were picked \nout;\
    \ from which each of these applications has a total of 23 \ndivergent areas combined.\
    \ These areas contribute to all the \nresearch that has been done in the blockchain\
    \ in the rural \ndevelopment sector and are distributed across 37 countries \n\
    obtained from 6 journals and 1 web source ranging from \nthe years 2010 to 2020.\
    \ After searching through journals, \napplying more than 16 keywords, 112 articles\
    \ were found in \naggregate. From analyzing each article, the primary applica-\n\
    tion of blockchain was identified as agriculture with 67% of \nresearch articles\
    \ relative to blockchain in agriculture whence \n60% were associated with supply\
    \ chain traceability. About \n55% of those papers were from the Institute of Electrical\
    \ and \nElectronics Engineers (IEEE). Furthermore, in 112 research \npapers, 8\
    \ technologies were implemented with a total of 58 \nplatforms and tools combined.\n\
    5.3  Research Questions Addressed\nFrom the Research Questions defined (Table 3),\
    \ the follow-\ning inference can be made:\nRQ1 What are the main applications\
    \ and areas of imple-\nmenting Blockchain Technology in Rural Development?\nVarious\
    \ extensively researched applications are defined \nin Tables 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,\
    \ 11 and 12. These applications \ndefine the Blockchain’s applications in rural\
    \ development \nthat impact the rural areas, provide security, opportunities,\
    \ \navailability of resources, and a better lifestyle. The areas \n(Fig. 20) gave\
    \ extensive knowledge about the domains of \napplication-defined from several\
    \ research articles related to \nit.\nRQ2 What are the major issues in Rural Development\
    \ and \nhow they can be addressed using Blockchain Technology?\nNumerous issues\
    \ in rural areas are explained in Sect. 1.1.1 \nand the blockchain applications\
    \ for the eradication of those \nissues are addressed in Sect. 3.\nRQ3 What are\
    \ the targeted software, platforms, and tools \nfor the implementation of blockchain\
    \ in rural development?\nThroughout the applications, for implementation follow-\n\
    ing (Table 15) technologies’ integration, and software and \nplatforms were used:\n\
    RQ4.  What are the research gaps and future research direc-\ntions for applying\
    \ blockchain technology to rural \ndevelopment?\nFollowing the review, in agriculture,\
    \ most emphases were \nstated towards supply chain traceability and less or no\
    \ work \nin natural resource management, overproduction, yield stag-\nnation,\
    \ and international trade. In regards to the sociological \nfactor, research on\
    \ work belonging to blockchain develop-\nment for rural education, housing, women\
    \ empowerment, \ncrime reduction, brain drain, and craftsmanship is missing. \n\
    For the implementation of banking, healthcare, and many \nother applications the\
    \ required government and technologi-\ncal assist are still lacking. In some cases,\
    \ the research pro-\nposed could be administered only in the far future, therefore\
    \ \ncontemporary work was absent. Some more gaps and future \nresearch directions\
    \ are given in Sects. 4.2 and 6.1.\nThe research questions mentioned in Table \
    \ 3 are \naddressed in the following section (Table 16):\n6  Threat to Validity\
    \ and Limitation \nof the Survey\nWhile reviewing the issues in rural areas, blockchain\

    \ for Smart Villages \n1 3\n2.3. During exclusion, some articles were not considered\
    \ fit \nfor this review, were missed, or were not found. Six appli-\ncations were\
    \ considered in this review, there could be more \napplications that we couldn’t\
    \ figure or that couldn’t make the \ncut of criteria. A total of 23 sub-areas\
    \ of all the applications \nwere determined. Conclusively, as per our knowledge,\
    \ there \nwasn’t any systematic review that reviewed all the applica-\ntion areas\
    \ of blockchain technology in rural and sustainable \ndevelopment nevertheless\
    \ there could have been a few rural \nand sustainable development articles that\
    \ weren’t included \nin this review.\n7  Conclusion and Future Work\nBlockchain\
    \ Technology has presented a considerable amount \nof work in the rural sector.\
    \ While its implementation was \nfew, the ideology is enough to motivate people\
    \ into changing \nthe lifestyle of rural people leading to the overall country’s\
    \ \ndevelopment. In this systematic literature review, numerous \napplications\
    \ of blockchain technology in sustainable rural \ndevelopment were discussed with\
    \ diverse areas in each \napplication. A comparative study of each application\
    \ in all \nthe areas pertaining to different approaches has been por-\ntrayed\
    \ with differing attributes elucidating the technology, \nprocess, and techniques\
    \ behind each article. The paper pro-\nvides extensive literature towards each\
    \ of the articles sorted \nafter applying the review process consisting of relevant\
    \ arti-\ncles and keywords. The primary findings of the systematic \nliterature\
    \ review were as follows:\n(a) From the review, we were able to identify common\
    \ and \nexceptional uses of blockchain technology that would \nhelp uplift the\
    \ rural community and lead to sustainable \nrural development.\n(b) Various distinct\
    \ approaches to implementing block-\nchain technology for rural welfare were discovered.\n\
    (c) Platforms and tools that would facilitate the use of these \napplications\
    \ for farmers and uninstructed agrestic peo-\nple were identified and reviewed.\n\
    (d) Blockchain’s integration with multiple powerful tech-\nnologies for rural\
    \ development was reviewed.\n(e) An overall idea for a collaborative approach\
    \ leading to \na smart village framework was constructed.\nThe gaps determined\
    \ from reviewing the articles broadly \nwould help researchers explore additional\
    \ as well as alter-\nnative utilization of blockchain technology for sustainable\
    \ \nrural development.\n7.1  Future Work\nBlockchain’s characteristics are exceptionally\
    \ conducive to \nsafety, privacy, integrity, traceability, efficiency, and trans-\n\
    parency in every area limited by such advantages. While \ndiverse blockchain applications\
    \ for the welfare of rural \ncommunity has been discussed nevertheless future\
    \ work \ncan comprise of facilitating applications in making use of \nblockchain\
    \ incentives for a collaborative framework incor-\nporating several services in\
    \ rural areas namely Smart Vil-\nlage. Blockchain technology in terms of providing\
    \ incentive \nmechanisms could lead to a better motivational unit in many \nareas.\
    \ Incentivizing rural or urban people for education, data \nsharing, green farming,\
    \ green behavior, and environment \nconservation are real future demands. Apart\
    \ from empha-\nsizing rural areas, blockchain’s integration with network-\ning,\
    \ cybersecurity, and digital advertising is also a future \ninsistence.\nFunding\

  explanation: Blockchain technology is a secure, distributed ledger that has great
    potential for addressing challenges in the global food industry. This systematic
    review analyzes the literature on automated systems for real-time irrigation management
    using IoT and machine learning technologies. The main goal of this review is to
    investigate the current state and future potential of end-to-end, automated irrigation
    management systems that integrate these technologies. The authors also examine
    the effectiveness and efficiency of integrated, end-to-end automated irrigation
    systems.
  extract_1: '"Addressing the global food challenge: The review aims to explore how
    automated, real-time irrigation management systems can contribute to the efficient
    use of water resources and enhance agricultural productivity to meet the growing
    demand for food."'
  extract_2: '"Highlighting the role of interoperability and standardization: The
    review seeks to emphasize the importance of interoperability and standardization
    in enabling the integration of components within the automated irrigation management
    pipeline. It aims to identify existing and emerging standards and their applicability
    to real-time irrigation management systems."'

    Blockchain technology is a secure distributed ledger for lists of transactions,
    which has immense potential to solve traditional agri-food supply chain issues.
    An increasing number of research on blockchain-based traceability applications
    aims to improve food quality and safety. Still, relatively few works considered
    user interfaces when developing and reporting their applications, which could
    lead to usability issues. This paper aims to address this gap by reviewing existing
    works from user interface perspectives. We gathered 25 review papers on blockchain
    or agri-food supply chain and 39 research papers that presented screenshots of
    user interfaces of related applications. We first reviewed 7 review papers that
    focused on the blockchain-based agri-food supply chain to understand the benefits
    and challenges in the blockchain applications. We then analyzed 14 blockchain-based
    agri-food traceability applications and 10 non-blockchain-based agri-food traceability
    applications. The analysis resulted in categorizations of 5 target user groups,
    3 main approaches for collecting data, 5 main approaches for visualizing data,
    and a discussion of other aspects of user interfaces. However, we found insufficient
    details and discussions on the user interfaces and design decisions of the applications
    for further usability assessment. Additionally, user involvement for evaluation
    is lower in blockchain-based researches than in non-blockchain-based researches.
    This trend could lead to usability problems of blockchain applications, causing
    blockchain technology to be underutilized. Finally, we discussed research gaps
    and future research directions related to user interface design, which should
    be addressed to ease future blockchain adoption. In this paper, we first reviewed
    7 review papers about the blockchain-based agri-food supply chain to understand
    the benefits and challenges in the blockchain application...View more Published

    Nowadays, people are increasingly interested in cryptocurrency, a new secure payment
    method that enables anyone to exchange online without the need of trusted parties
    such as banks or credit card companies. The technology underlying the cryptocurrency
    is called the “blockchain.” Blockchain technology introduces distributed storage
    for growing lists of transactions, which are grouped into a block before recording
    on the blockchain. Participants in the blockchain network must mutually agree
    for a block to be recorded. Once recorded, the data cannot be modified without
    changing all subsequent blocks. In short, the blockchain is “an open, distributed
    ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable
    and permanent way [1].” As blockchain technology is gaining more attention, researchers
    began investigating blockchain applications in other domains, including making
    the agri-food supply chain transparent and traceable. The agri-food supply chain
    involves processes to “bring agricultural or horticultural products from the farm
    to the table [2].” Nowadays, customers are looking for food quality, safety, and
    nutrition. However, the traditional supply chain, where a central party holds
    all information, could not provide trustworthy information to interested customers
    in a timely manner. Applications of blockchain technology, where all involved
    parties can access and verify digitalized information, are seen as a way to solve
    traditional agri-food supply chain issues. A considerable number of research papers
    (e.g., [3]–[9]) discussed the potential of blockchains in the agri-food domain.
    However, most papers focused on technical perspectives and rarely paid attention
    to human factors, which are a crucial part of technology adoption. There is a
    very limited understanding of how human users could use this blockchain technology
    to achieve their goals effectively, efficiently, and satisfactorily. User interface
    designers, as a part of the Human-Computer Interaction community, could play a
    role in connecting the design and implementation of blockchain technology to reality
    [10], [11]. Domain-wise, research works about the user interface of agri-food
    traceability applications are relatively scarce. A search in Scopus database on
    20 May 2021 with the query (food OR agriculture) AND (“supply chain” OR traceability)
    returned 14,272 document results, while the query (“user interface” AND (food
    OR agriculture) AND (“supply chain” OR traceability) returned only 28 document
    results. As a result, there is very limited knowledge about how to design user
    interfaces for agri-food traceability applications. Furthermore, the usability
    of those interfaces may be not confirmed due to the lack of user study. This work
    aims to provide a basis for designing usable blockchain-based agri-food traceability
    applications. We first examined review papers in this domain to understand the
    current state of the development. We were interested in how blockchain could bring
    benefits and challenges to stakeholders, businesses, and technology for agri-food
    supply chains. We then analyzed existing works from a user interface perspective
    to summarize (1) target users and user interface purposes, (2) how applications
    collect the data, (3) how applications visualize the data, and (4) other aspects
    of user interfaces corresponding to the benefits and challenges of the blockchain.
    We then discuss research gaps and how could our classification provide future
    directions of research in this domain. Figure 1 illustrates the paper sources
    and the results. FIGURE 1. Overview of paper sources and results. We first reviewed
    7 review papers about the blockchain-based agri-food supply chain to understand
    the benefits and challenges in the blockchain applications. We then analyzed 24
    user interfaces of agri-food traceability applications to categorize target user
    groups, approaches for collecting data, approaches for visualizing data, and other
    aspects of the user interfaces. Show All Our contributions include: Analysis of
    benefits and challenges in applying blockchain technology for agri-food traceability
    (Section IV) Categorization of user interfaces for agri-food traceability (Section
    V) Discussion of research gaps and future directions regarding user interfaces
    for agri-food traceability (Section VI) The remainder of this paper is organized
    as follows. Section II provides the background on blockchain, agri-food traceability,
    and user interfaces, on which this paper is based on. After that, Section III
    describes the methodology used to conduct the review and analysis in this paper.
    The results are presented in Section IV and Section V. Then, Section VI discusses
    the research gaps and future directions regarding user interfaces for agri-food
    traceability. Finally, Section VII concludes the paper. SECTION II. Background
    Our paper aims to understand the intersection of 3 areas: blockchain, agri-food
    traceability, and user interfaces, which are introduced in this section. A. Blockchain
    Blockchain is a technique to store cryptographically linked records across parties
    in a peer-to-peer network to prevent tampering of records. The blockchain was
    invented to facilitate bitcoin transactions [12]. A “block” consists of a set
    of confirmed transactions or records, a timestamp, and a hash code. The hash code
    is calculated from the content in the block and the previous block (i.e., “chain”).
    Adding the block to the chain requires the majority of the involved parties to
    verify the block. For instance, the prover (or miner) proves to the verifiers
    that the computational effort has been expended for some purpose (Proof-of-Work).
    Other consensus mechanisms, such as Proof of Authority (PoA) or Proof of Assignment
    (PoAss), can also be used (see [13] for a review). Blockchain components include
    [9], [14], [15]: Cryptography: Strong encryption to allow decryption by authorized
    users only; Ledger: A shared and distributed database to store data; Consensus:
    A protocol to prevent minor nodes to modify transactions; Smart Contract: Rules,
    penalties, and actions to be automatically applied to the involved parties once
    the condition is met. Main features and characteristics of blockchain include
    [3], [13], [14], [16]: Decentralization: Nodes (participants) in a peer to peer
    network work together to process and validate data without a need for a single
    central trust party; Trust-less: Each participant can participate without knowing
    each other; Anonymity: Each participant can communicate using a generated virtual
    identity code; Permission-less: There is no restriction of participants; Autonomy:
    Each node can safely perform transactions without third party intervention; Ownership
    and uniqueness: A block include transaction information as well as its owner and
    a unique hash code; Irreversibly and Persistency: Canceling a transaction is impossible
    once a chain adds the block; Immutability: Timestamps and controls ensure that
    stored data cannot be changed; Transparency: Involved parties can access and trace
    stored data; Auditability: Securely linked blocks facilitate transaction verification
    and tracking; Provenance: A digital information attached to each product can prove
    its authenticity and origin; Censorship resistant: Transactions cannot be censored
    as a network does not need controllers; Open source: Everyone in the network can
    access the source with a sense of hierarchy. Not all features are desirable. For
    instance, the permissionless property could introduce security issues since anyone
    can create a transaction that could be used for malicious purposes. Implementation
    of a blockchain system could differ in terms of who are the provers and validators
    of blocks, who can access the system, security and efficiency level, design methods,
    and blockchain authority [13]. These choices could classify blockchains into three
    types: public, private, and consortium blockchain (i.e., permissioned or hybrid
    blockchain). This paper does not focus on the technical aspects of blockchain.
    Rather, we focus on how these features could benefit or raise issues in agri-food
    traceability applications as well as how they influence user interface design.
    B. Agri-Food Supply Chain and Traceability Agri-food supply chain is “the activities
    from production to distribution that brings agricultural or horticultural products
    from the farm to the table [2].” The agri-food supply chain is more complex and
    difficult to handle than other supply chains due to the presence of various stakeholders
    and influences. Agri-food products have limited shelf life. Food safety and quality
    depend on time as well as environments, such as weather and transportation. Contamination
    can occur at any stage. Furthermore, food globalization results in longer food
    chains, which complicates foodborne disease investigation and product recall [17].
    This complexity leads to the need for higher efficiency and closer partner collaboration.
    Traditional food supply chains generally rely on a central party to manage information,
    which could lead to transparency and trust issues. For instance, a company may
    release only information beneficial to them. Customers could have difficulty verifying
    many food characteristics claimed by the company. When there are food safety scandals,
    the information asymmetry situation between the public and food manufacturers
    could affect customers’ judgments and result in decreasing sale volume [18]. Traceability
    systems offer a means to address issues in food supply chains. International Organization
    for Standardization (ISO) defined traceability as “the ability to follow the movement
    of a feed or food through specified stage(s) of production, processing, and distribution”
    in ISO 22005:2007 [19], though the actual definition of traceability varies by
    the variety of food [20]. Regardless of minor differences in the definitions,
    knowing movement and steps in the production process could facilitate recalling
    contaminated products, thus improving consumers’ safety and confidence. The traceability
    can be categorized based on several stakeholders involved and traceability requirements.
    The traceability could involve a single stakeholder (i.e., intra-company or internal
    level) or all stakeholders (i.e., supply chain or external level) [21], [22].
    European Community market categorizes traceability into mandatory traceability
    and voluntary traceability [21], [23]. Mandatory traceability mainly aims for
    financial purposes whereas voluntary traceability mainly aims for food safety
    and quality. Trustworthy and complete traceability require both mandatory and
    voluntary traceability processes. However, as each stakeholder has various standards
    and tracking methods, the voluntary system is complex with a wide variety of acquired
    data [24]. In general, Corallo et al. [21] suggested four major questions when
    developing a traceability system: which data to collect, who own the data, how
    to collect the data, and how to make the data available and understandable. This
    paper focuses on the supply chain (external level). We are particularly interested
    in how to collect the data, and how to make the data available and understandable,
    which influence and could be benefited by better user interface design. C. Blockchain-Based
    AGRI-Food Traceability Many researchers are adopting blockchain technology as
    a way to facilitate traceability. The blockchain is deemed to “bring transparency,
    enhance information authenticity, and speed up food recall [9].” The blockchain
    potential is demonstrated by a considerable number of review papers that focused
    on the blockchain-based supply chain in agriculture or food domain [3]–[9], with
    the highest number of 178 reviewed items by Dutta et al. [3]. This paper also
    focuses on blockchain-based supply chain traceability in the agriculture or food
    domain. We provide an analysis of the review papers in this domain. Additionally,
    we present a discussion on the user interface (i.e., how to collect the data and
    how to make the data available and understandable), which was not discussed in
    other review papers. D. Human-Computer Interaction and User Interface Design “Human-computer
    interaction (HCI) is a multidisciplinary field of study focusing on the design
    of computer technology and, in particular, the interaction between humans (the
    users) and computers [25].” HCI overlaps with multiple research areas, including
    user interface (UI) design that concerns the mean for users to interact with a
    system. User interface design generally aims at improving usability, which can
    be assessed by five quality components (learnability, efficiency, memorability,
    errors, satisfaction) [26]. One basic method to evaluate usability is user testing.
    Researchers can identify usability problems by observing representative users
    perform representative tasks with the user interface. Successful software development
    desires usable interfaces. However, studies on HCI and UI for blockchain are still
    inadequate. Foth [11] discussed a beef supply chain case study and blockchain
    research agenda for HCI, calling for interaction designers to be aware of blockchain
    technology. Elsden et al. [10] surveyed 200 emerging blockchain startups, projects,
    and applications to identify the role of HCI in connecting the design and application
    of blockchain technology. They found that research in HCI mostly focused on money,
    finance, and peer-to-peer exchange. They suggested more researches in engaging
    participants and designing with blockchain in other domains. This paper focuses
    on the agri-food domain. We investigated works that engaged participants in their
    development process and looked for classifications that could aid blockchain designing.
    SECTION III. Methodology We conducted a systematic literature search in the Scopus
    database, which is one of the largest databases of peer-reviewed literature. The
    search was done during November and December 2020 using the following queries
    for title, abstract, and keywords (TITLE-ABS-KEY). Q1: blockchain AND (food OR
    agriculture) AND (“supply chain” OR traceability) Q2: “user interface” AND (food
    OR agriculture) AND (“supply chain” OR traceability) Q3: blockchain and “user
    interface” Q4: blockchain and HCI We interested in (1) blockchain, (2) agriculture,
    food, supply chain, and/or traceability, and (3) user interface. Figure 2 illustrates
    three topics of interest and how the query aims to address the overlapping topics.
    The white areas, such as blockchain without user interface in other domains, are
    not in the scope of this paper. FIGURE 2. A diagram showing the topics of (1)
    blockchain, (2) agriculture, food, supply chain, and/or traceability, and (3)
    user interface. Grey areas indicate where each Query covered. The number behind
    the query number is the number of papers returned by the query. Show All We formulated
    these queries to cover all aspects that could be useful in designing a user interface
    for blockchain-based agri-food traceability applications. The first query aimed
    to gather all works on blockchain-based agri-food traceability applications. We
    excluded the term “user interface” from this query. Instead, we manually skimmed
    papers for a user interface to avoid missing works that did not focus on the user
    interface but implemented one. The rest of the queries aimed to gather the user
    interface of similar works, i.e., either agri-food traceability application or
    blockchain application in general, that may be applicable to blockchain-based
    agri-food traceability applications. They also helped to gather related works
    that used other specific terms, such as coffee instead of agriculture. There was
    no publication year restriction. We found 335 articles in total. After removing
    7 duplicated articles, we filtered the results using the following inclusion criteria:
    The full-text of the article was in English; The article was a full research or
    review paper (e.g., workshop papers and proceedings are excluded); The full-text
    of the article was available and accessible; The article discussed either blockchain,
    agriculture, food, supply chain, or traceability in detail. We then group the
    articles into two major categories: The article that provided an overview of the
    topic (i.e., review papers) The article that contained a screenshot of the user
    interface of the application We then further group articles based on topics: blockchain,
    agriculture, food, supply chain, traceability, and/or user interface. Figure 3
    provides the overview of our review methodology and topic grouping. Note that
    works outside a group might briefly mention the group. For example, two review
    papers of blockchain in general might mention the supply chain in their discussion,
    but not in detail. FIGURE 3. Review methodology where n is a number of articles.
    The shaded boxes indicated papers we focused in this review while the dashes boxes
    indicated papers that we skimmed through. Show All As demonstrated in Figure 3,
    the majority of works in blockchain-based agri-food traceability do not present
    a screenshot of the user interface, which could be one reason for lacking a review
    paper in this domain. Finally, we focused on 7 papers that reviewed blockchain-based
    agri-food supply chain, 14 papers included screenshots of blockchain-based agri-food
    supply chain applications, and 10 papers included screenshots of non-blockchain-based
    (traditional) agri-food supply chain applications. We first analyzed the review
    papers to understand the current development, benefits, and challenges in applying
    blockchain to agri-food supply chain traceability in Section IV. The analysis
    provided a basis for analyzing user interfaces in Section V and discussion in
    Section VI. Note that we gave higher priority to screenshots since it allowed
    better analysis of user interface elements than text description. Other articles
    that fitted the criteria but did not fall into any group were skimmed and included
    in this review only when we found them useful in the discussion. We also performed
    ad-hoc searches for key papers that were cited in gathered papers or deemed as
    useful for our discussion. The ad-hoc articles were not included in the figures.
    Our method has two limitations. First, there could be works that addressed specific
    agri-food products but did not show up in our search results. The queries could
    retrieve some specific agri-food products. For instance, the query “blockchain
    and ’user interface”’ did retrieve a blockchain-based autonomous coffee machine
    [27]. However, the queries excluded the works about blockchain-based coffee supply
    chains without the “user interface” keyword. Due to the vast variety of agri-food
    products, formulating queries for all products is very difficult. Second, we inspected
    the user interface manually from the provided screenshots. Thus, we might not
    be able to fully examine all user interface features. SECTION IV. Benefits and
    Challenges: a Review of Reviews This section summarizes the benefits and challenges
    of applying blockchain to the agri-food supply chains for traceability discussed
    in the review papers. We found 25 review papers of related topics, as listed in
    Table 1. The table notes whether the paper apparently discussed (1) models or
    frameworks to design or implement applications, (2) benefits or opportunities,
    and (3) challenges regarding the topic they reviewed. We found that most review
    papers discussed at least one of these three aspects in at least one section of
    the papers. Only [28] focused on technology applications. TABLE 1 The List of
    25 Review Papers With Title, Year of Publication, Where Number of Reviewed Papers
    as Well as an Indication Whether the Paper Apparently Discussed Model/Framework,
    Benefits/Opportunities, or Challenges Our analysis focused on seven review papers
    [3]–[9] that directly discussed blockchain-based supply chain in the agriculture
    or food domain (a part of Q1 area in Figure 2). Other review papers that missed
    some of the components, e.g., discussed only agriculture but not food, were noted.
    However, we decided to exclude the notes in this analysis since those findings
    may not directly apply to our focus domain and the seven review papers should
    be sufficient for this analysis. The seven papers discuss the benefits and challenges
    of blockchain in many aspects in their texts. We extracted the benefits and challenges
    and organized them into three categories: stakeholders, business, and technology.
    Table 2 provides the overview of the topics that each paper discussed and their
    references to support the discussion. Note that we removed some dead links and
    references that we deemed to be too general to support the arguments. TABLE 2
    The Overview of the Topics That Each Review Paper Discussed and Their References
    to Support the Discussion. Note That a Review Paper May Discuss the Topic Without
    Providing a Specific Reference A. Stakeholder This section discusses the benefits
    and challenges that apply to an actor in a supply chain. Each review paper identified
    different supply chain phases and stakeholders. For instance, traceability business
    stages by Feng et al. [4] included farming, harvesting, processing, logistics,
    cold storage, and consuming. On the other hand, steps in the food supply chain
    by Galvez et al. [8] included production, processing, storage, distribution, retailers,
    and administration. Regardless of the differences, we could classify the target
    stakeholders of benefits and challenges into producers, intermediaries, consumers,
    and regulators. 1) Producers Producers refer to people who produce an agricultural
    product or food ingredients, such as farmers or fishermen. Blockchain could safeguard
    farmers [3] and provide financial benefits to small or medium-size farmers in
    developing countries [6]. Blockchain-based applications, such as AgriLedger [44],
    FarmShare [43], and Davcev’s application [45], were deemed to foster cooperation
    among farmers and other stakeholders of the chain. Such cooperation could improve
    financial inclusion in developing economies [46]. Transparency of information
    could provide a fairer solution to conflicts among farmers. Blockchain applications
    could also provide a platform for traceability (e.g., [158]) or insurance programs
    (e.g., [159]) to the farmers. Regardless of the benefits, Kamilaris et al. [6]
    also mentioned challenges about farmers’ adoption, as the farmers need to understand
    blockchain before start using it [48]. This issue relates to the cost and risk
    of blockchain in Section IV-B4. 2) Intermediaries Intermediaries refer to people
    who buy the product from one stakeholder and sell to another, including wholesalers
    and retailers. Kamilaris et al. [6] referred to Sander’s survey [49] about positive
    influences of blockchain on purchasing decisions. Though the blockchain could
    help improve sales, limited resources of small and medium enterprises might be
    a challenge in their blockchain adoption [50]. 3) Consumers Customers refer to
    people who consume the product. Blockchain could improve consumer’s awareness
    and empowerment [6], as well as improve food safety and quality [3], [8], [51],
    [55]. Customers could ensure food safety and quality as blockchain-based applications
    provide real-time monitoring of biological, chemical, and physical hazards [52].
    Blockchain could facilitate reliable food exchange through higher traceability
    to achieve food integrity [8], [53]. As blockchain applications could quickly
    identify and link outbreaks back to specific sources [54], it could mitigate food
    fraud. Galvez et al. [8], however, raised challenges about rapidly changing consumer
    preferences and confidence due to product recalls and social networks. Also, as
    products with traceability typically come with higher prices, they could become
    a target of food fraudsters [6], [53]. 4) Regulators Regulators and authorities
    refer to people who verify and enforce regulations of the supply chain to, for
    example, ensure food safety. Blockchain applications could facilitate supply chain
    auditing [3] and reduce food risks [9], [56]. For example, the Accenture Traceability
    report [55] discussed a pilot study of blockchain with smart tagging to prevent
    illegal tuna fishing. Trust audit checking was supported by tamper-proof and traceable
    properties of blockchain [4]. Interestingly, all seven reviews discussed challenges
    in regulation, including regulation uncertainty, the role of governments, and
    conflicting between national regulators. One reason could be that regulation is
    one of the most underexplored areas [52]. As a central authority is inessential
    in a blockchain system, it prevents interventions like censorship as well as creates
    many uncertainties [57]. There are no legal regulations and standards to follow
    [61]. For instance, Lucena et al. [59] proposed blockchain-based grain quality
    assurance tracking but acknowledged that they did not prove their application
    in complex scenarios involving international trade and arbitration laws. This
    lack of policy and regulation leads to an adoption barrier [6]. Regulators should
    develop new policies or regulations to monitor and regulate the blockchain [58]
    to protect users [55], [60] and reduce the barrier for its wider adoption [7],
    [60]. 5) Relationship Between Stakeholders Blockchain provides a secure distributed
    means for transactions, connecting stakeholders from different locations, rules,
    or applications together [6], [53], [60], [63], [64]. Blockchain technology has
    the potential to provide a solid end-to-end connection between farmers and large
    buyers [70]–[72]. Participating parties could increase their reliability, responsibility,
    and commitment [66], [67]. Functioning as a digital institution of trust [65],
    the blockchain could enhance trust of customers [69] and collaboration between
    supply chain partners [4], [68]. This benefit could reduce dependency or remove
    intermediaries [3], [6]. Blockchains could both bring benefits and raise challenges
    related to each stakeholder. In practice, however, analyzing the benefits and
    challenges could be complicated due to the diversity and conflicts between stakeholders
    in the chain [3], [5], [8]. Different stakeholders in different sectors or industries
    or countries could have different objectives and practices. While blockchain could
    remove intermediaries, the perception that blockchain could lead to job loss is
    one challenge in blockchain adoption [3]. Also, as blockchain connects stakeholders
    together, there is an important question about who should own the blockchain [6],
    [60]. B. Business This section discusses benefits and challenges that apply to
    actors across a supply chain, which affect the business of buying and selling
    agri-food products. We classify them into traceability, efficiency, privacy, cost
    and risk, and sustainability. 1) Traceability Blockchain allows users to follow
    agri-food products between stakeholders in a supply chain. Feng et al. [4] analyzed
    the traceability issues that blockchains could address, including how to coordinate,
    verify, link, and record transactions. The blockchain allows origin tracing of
    products from farms to consumers [3], [4], [77]–[80]. Chan et al. [82] proposed
    a blockchain-based agri-food supply chain management framework for traceability
    and transparency, which allows information disclosing to stakeholders in a supply
    chain, so it addresses information asymmetry [9], [52]. In addition to transparency,
    blockchain allows stakeholders to audit transactions [9], [73]. As the blockchain
    is immutable, it ensures that information will not be tampered [75], [76]. All
    valid users can examine and have a copy of the transaction history [74]. Galvez
    et al. [8] also discussed the potential of blockchain in food authenticity, which
    ensured no alteration of information that could happen when it was under the control
    of a specific party. Thus, blockchains may be used to tackle food fraud and increase
    traceability performance. Traceability, however, relies on data collection. A
    lack of records is simply a challenge of food traceability [8]. Products can be
    purposely damaged without notifying blockchain users [77]. Furthermore, it is
    difficult to ensure the authenticity, security, and integrity of raw input data
    [4], [8], [9], [57]. The data accuracy, either from sensors or persons, cannot
    be guaranteed [5], [8]. Furthermore, analytical methods cannot monitor all parameters
    of food products, especially the environmental parameters [5], [6], [53], [83].
    To address this data manipulation issue, third parties such as governments could
    make regular checks in the blockchain network [9], [52], [55]. 2) Efficiency Blockchain
    could enhance business performance with less effort. Dutta et al. [3], Leng et
    al. [93], and Hasan et al. [94] argued that blockchain could enhance the overall
    efficiency, throughput, and credibility of the related platforms, which could
    ease business expansion. Blockchain with digitized product movement and certifications
    provides real-time information of food products [9], [52], [68] and could reduce
    time to trace from nearly a week to few seconds [6], [9], [85], [88]. This property
    allows a quick trace of contaminated products when there is an outbreak of an
    animal or plant disease [6], [65]. Trust and self-organized nature could reduce
    human intervention [9], [89]. Integration with IoT devices makes the supply chain
    more efficient [4], [8], [9], [52], [55], [68], [89]–[92]. Ferrer [87], for example,
    leveraged blockchain to enhance the security, autonomy, and flexibility of agricultural
    robotic swarm operations. Thiruchelvam et al. [95] leveraged blockchain to facilitate
    data recording and automatic payment transfer. Blockchain with smart contracts
    can automatically execute and evaluate transactions [8], [84], which can prevent
    further damage with warnings [9], [52], [73]. Participants can evaluate the assertions
    made and notify interested parties according to conditions such as quality, timing,
    or quantity. Smart contracts could lead to scalable and flexible businesses at
    a lower cost, thus improve the overall effectiveness of manufacturing services
    [6], [86]. There is no specific challenge regarding business efficiency. 3) Privacy
    Anonymity and security property of blockchain could support keeping personal and
    business matters and relationships secret. Dutta et al. [3] suggested that blockchain
    could increase the privacy of enterprise information. Transaction visibility and
    anonymity of blockchain could ensure the traceability, reliability, security,
    and information timeliness of agri-food products [4]. Compared to the benefits
    that were briefly mentioned, blockchain raises more privacy problems. Permanent
    data visibility and transparency could compromise privacy [6], [7], [57]. Zhao
    et al. [7] discussed several works that raised the privacy leakage issue and efforts
    for protecting privacy. For example, some stakeholders might not want to share
    information to maintain business competitiveness. Private or permissioned blockchain
    might be preferred over public blockchains. The selection of the proper type was
    not sufficiently discussed and seen as one challenge in blockchain implementation
    [5]. Even with privacy management, transactional privacy can still not be guaranteed
    because all participants in the network can access all information [7], [96],
    [97], and some participants might be competitors [98]. There is still no method
    to hide all involved parties and transaction amount at the same time [7], [100].
    Privacy is one of the two major drawbacks of blockchain [7], [101]. There is a
    need to consider these issues on data management, particularly data ownership
    and data retention [5], [60]. 4) Cost and Risk Kamilaris et al. [6] suggested
    that blockchain could help reduce transaction fees and facilitate fairer pricing
    through the whole chain. The cost of computing and censoring the equipment required
    to run the system was deemed as a challenge in adopting blockchain (e.g., [3],
    [5]–[7]). Adopting blockchain could require many product transformations and organizational
    changes [5], which needs a lot of money and time [3], [7], [103], [108]. The cost
    of implementing blockchain could be a barrier for adopting [6], [9], [55], [60],
    [102]. Developing countries may find difficulties because of the high degree of
    computing equipment required [6], [7]. Hence, Duan et al. [9], [55], [60] suggested
    that the blockchain should be more “SME friendly.” As the technology was still
    in the early stage, high uncertainties and market volatility could also be challenges
    in the adoption. Many stakeholders have old mindsets as well as a lack of awareness
    of blockchain technology and its advantages (e.g., [6], [7], [9], [114]). There
    exists an idea that blockchain may deskill workers and organizations [6], [111].
    Furthermore, convincing business cases are still limited. [6], [48]. The high
    volatility of cryptocurrencies could reduce the public trust of the blockchain
    technology [6], [112]. Many stakeholders may have limited education and required
    skills to adopt a blockchain-based application [3], [5]–[7]. The training platforms
    are still inadequate [6], [110]. Regardless of these costs and risks, the benefits
    of blockchain make the costs sustainable [6], [9], [102]. Requirements of adoption
    could be varied by stages of the supply chain [9], [55]. Perboli et al. [102]
    encouraged the partial implementation of blockchain instead of replacing the whole
    system. Other technologies can be more suitable in some cases [9], [55], [114].
    Improving users’ familiarity with blockchain could improve adoption attitude [9],
    [113]. Finally, governments should play a role in reducing adoption barriers by
    setting examples [5], [6]. 5) Sustainability Blockchain could improve the ability
    to maintain the business in economic, environmental, and social aspects [6]. Blockchain
    could aid supervision and management [3], [130], which helps eliminate food adulteration,
    improve food safety and quality, and reduce uncoordinated issues, thus increasing
    sustainability (e.g., [3], [8], [60], [126]–[129]). Blockchain could help in resource
    allocation [3] as well as enhance demand and quality prediction [4], [9], [76],
    [120]–[122]. Better management could reduce economic loss and product waste [4],
    [61], [108], [123] as well as provide support for emission reduction [6]. Blockchain
    for recording water quality data could lead to sustainable water management [6],
    [7], [9], [119]. Socially, blockchain could empower the poor in developing countries
    [118] and provide food security (e.g., by providing a food coupon to refugees
    [117]). Consumers became more interested in environmental impact and ethical working
    conditions [8], [131], [132]. Lee et al. [64] suggested blockchain as a tool for
    monitoring social and environmental responsibility. Similarly, Rejeb [90] suggested
    blockchain as a framework for environmental, social, and economic regulatory,
    as well as corruption mitigation. Wrongdoings outside the organization could be
    held accountable [8], [133]. C. Technology This section discusses technology advantages
    and challenges brought by blockchain, including scalability, security, and infrastructure.
    1) Scalability Dutta et al. [3] discussed blockchain for supply chain functions
    that addressed many traditional supply chain issues and improved scalability,
    which could enable a business or a system to grow larger. Scalability, however,
    was deemed an important challenge in blockchain applications. Main issues include
    transaction speed, latency, and storage capacity of blockchain and IoT devices
    [4]–[8]. Latency refers to the delay between a user’s actions and the system’s
    responses. Four papers ([4], [6]–[8]) discussed latency issues with reference
    to various works such as [57], [142], [143]. Network delays can necessitate additional
    computational resources and processing time [7], [139]. Transaction speed is one
    of the two main challenges of blockchain applications [7], [101]. Information
    transparency and immutability could lead to performance issues in supply chains
    [6], [111]. Ethereum, for example, could handle 15 transactions per second, which
    was very slow compared to 45,000 transactions per second in traditional platforms
    [9], [141]. Large transaction volumes require more time and mechanisms to validate
    large blocks [7], [136], [138]. Storage requirements of blockchain are significant
    [7], [57]. Any individual in a supply chain must have all transaction records
    on hand at all times [7], [103], thus the blockchain could become voluminous [135].
    Pearson et al. [60] suspected that these scalability issues lead to limited usage
    of blockchain. 2) Security Blockchain could enhance data integrity and transaction
    security through digital fingerprint [3], [4], [144]–[146]. Such fingerprint could
    be stored in a local file, local hash tree, external hash tree, distributed ledger,
    public database, or hybrid distributed ledgers [8]. Although blockchain is secure
    by design, ensuring security is challenging and data security is still an issue
    [4], [149]. Programming bugs could also introduce vulnerability in smart contracts
    [4], [147]. 3) Infrastructure Overall infrastructure was also a challenge in blockchain
    adoption. Duan et al. [9], Perboli et al. [102], and Ometoruwa‘ [154] suggested
    difficulties in realizing decentralization, scalability, and security at the same
    time. Different ways to balance the three features might be needed for different
    stages of the food supply chain [9], [55]. Design limitations constrained the
    choice of consensus algorithm, transaction capacity, and data accessibility [4],
    [142], [143], [155]. As traceability requires information exchange between stakeholders,
    which could adopt different systems, interoperability and standardization were
    challenges discussed in [3]–[5]. Blockchain was often combined with IoT to offer
    scalability, security, auditing, efficiency, interoperability, and quality solutions
    [9], [91]. Nonetheless, the capability of IoT-based devices is less than that
    needed by blockchain [4], [57], [155]. Moreover, complex underlying digital technology
    that incorporates sensors or other third-party tools might compromise the decentralized
    trust [6], [68], [150]–[152]. There exists a digital gap between developed, developing,
    and underdeveloped countries [5], [6], [153]. Poor infrastructure, such as an
    absence of public key infrastructure, would not be sufficient to satisfy the needs
    of a blockchain-based system [4]. New users might find a barrier to market due
    to this issue [6], [60], especially if large companies implement private and permissioned
    blockchain [6], [60]. SECTION V. User Interface This section reviews articles
    that included screenshots of user interfaces for 14 blockchain-based and 10 non-blockchain-based
    agri-food applications. We also considered articles that did not include screenshots
    or included screenshots of blockchain-based applications in other domains as well
    since some of them could benefit from designing blockchain-based agri-food applications.
    The following subsections summarize the target users and purpose of the interfaces,
    how such interfaces were designed to support traceability, as well as other aspects
    of user interfaces that facilitate traceability applications. A. Target Users
    and Purposes Table 3 and Table 4 provide the list of blockchain-based and non-blockchain-based
    agri-food applications, respectively. The tables include title, year of publication,
    as well as an indication of whether the paper included a screenshot of user interfaces
    for each stakeholder, discussed model or architecture, or involved users in development
    or testing. Note that the lack of a checkmark means unclear whether the interface
    is for a corresponding user. TABLE 3 List of 14 Articles Focusing on Blockchain-Based
    Applications for Agri-Food Supply Chain. The List Includes the Title, Year of
    Publication, As Well as an Indication of Whether the Paper Discussed Models or
    Architecture, Involved Users in Development or Testing, And Included a Screenshot
    of a User Interface for Each Stakeholder. Note That the Lack of a Checkmark Means
    Unclear Whether the Interface is for a Corresponding User TABLE 4 A List of 10
    Articles Focusing on Non-Blockchain Applications for Agri-Food Supply Chain. The
    List Includes the Title, Year of Publication, as Well as an Indication of Whether
    the Paper Discussed Models or Architecture, Involved Users in Development or Testing,
    and Included a Screenshot of a User Interface for Each Stakeholder. The Lack of
    a Checkmark Means Unclear Whether the Interface is for a Corresponding User We
    categorize target users of agri-food applications based on stakeholders. Similar
    to the stakeholders discussed in IV-A, the target users include producers, intermediaries,
    and customers. The target users also include processors who transform the product
    into other forms, such as egg packagers or food processing industries, and distributors
    who transfer and/or distribute the product between stakeholders. The purpose of
    a user interface generally varies by the target users. 1) Producers Screenshots
    of user interfaces for producers were mostly presented in early works on agri-food
    applications, which did not leverage blockchain. Only a few blockchain-based research
    works provided screenshots for producers. The purposes were mostly to support
    decision making, which we found in a livestock management system [174], a decision
    support system for identification of genetically modified food or feed products
    [176], a weather forecast information dissemination system [177], a decision support
    system for choosing the priority of corporate social responsibility (CSR) program
    [173], and a credit evaluation system [130]. Only two works provided an interface
    to load information to a system, i.e., registering crops [164] and loading information
    into RFID tags for identifying and verifying agrochemicals [171]. This trend could
    be influenced by the usage of sensors to automatically input information to a
    system. Section V-B will discuss the input methods in more detail. 2) Processors
    Similar to user interfaces for producers, user interfaces for processors aimed
    at updating information [167] and supporting decision making [172]. Cong An et
    al. [167] built a supply chain management system based on blockchain technology
    for tracking the origins of agriculture products. Ali and Bahnasawy [172] purposed
    a decision support system for food processing industries. 3) Distributors Palacio
    et al. [175] interviewed 50 people to understand the requirements in medicinal
    product transportation, then provided screenshots of the user interface for logistics
    personnel and messengers. The paper focused on monitoring temperature in the cold
    chain, which proper temperature control in logistics was essential. 4) Intermediaries
    There are more user interfaces targeted intermediaries. Three of them also provided
    user interfaces for the producers [130], [173], [176], where another one was a
    system for the distribution process of regional products [179]. All interfaces
    aimed at providing information and visualization for decision-making. Although
    some papers (e.g., [162], [180]) mentioned updating functionality, they did not
    provide screenshots nor discuss in detail. 5) Customers User interfaces for agri-food
    applications mostly focused on customers, especially for blockchain-based traceability
    applications. Customer’s user interfaces primarily visualize information for decision
    making. Two works [130], [167] also targeted producers, processors, or intermediaries.
    Other works allow customers to trace food products [126], [163], [166], farmland
    products [165], agriculture products [168], and specific agri-food products (i.e.,
    coffee [27] and Italian extra-virgin olive oil [169]). Section V-C will discuss
    the visualization methods in more detail. In addition to user interfaces for specific
    target stakeholders, some works provided user interfaces for system administrators
    or did not explicitly state target users [160]–[162], [164], [165], [167], [170],
    [178]. Interestingly, neither processors nor distributors were discussed as targets
    of benefits or source of challenges in the review papers. On the other hand, no
    work explicitly provided a screenshot for regulators or authorities though some
    articles included them as a stakeholder. The lack of exploration was in line with
    the finding when we reviewed the review articles. Overall, as counted in the Table
    3 and Table 4, the target users of blockchain-based agri-food applications concentrated
    on the customers, shifting from the non-blockchain-based applications where the
    target users leaned to the producers. This trend could probably influence by the
    benefit of blockchain in providing traceability and transparency to the supply
    chain, so the customers could access and trust the information. Another trend
    is that the researches on blockchain mostly discussed and focused on the model
    or architecture to implement the applications, with little user involvement during
    the application designing or testing. We discuss the user involvement in the following
    subsections when we discuss the user interface. B. How to Collect the Data We
    categorize how a traceability application gathers information into three methods:
    form entry, label scanning, and sensor transmission, as summarized in Table 5.
    TABLE 5 Input Methods With Description and Examples 1) Form Entry Form entry gets
    information through, for example, text fields or buttons. A user manually inputs
    information to a system. The system could leverage the input form at any stage
    of a supply chain, such as crop registration [164], livestock management [174],
    logistics [175], or purchasing [126]. The form could be used as a basis or in
    conjunction with other methods. Peets et al. [171], for example, proposed a user
    interface consisting of retrieved data as well as confirm and manual entry buttons
    to assist information loading to a label. They also conducted an experiment with
    10 commercially active sprayer operators and interviewed participants for an opinion
    about the size of the screen, instructions, and the flow of the program. However,
    they only mentioned that the user interface was well received by the participants,
    without the detail of their findings. 2) Label Scanning Label scanning loads information
    from a piece of material attached to an object. One common way is a QR code (Quick
    Response code), which can be printed on a container for a customer to access product
    traceability information [126], [161], [164]–[166], [168], [169]. The label usually
    appears as a way to access information gathered via other methods. A user needs
    a reader to read the embedded information for the label to a system. A label could
    also leverage other technologies, such as a barcode, Near-Field Communication
    (NFC), or Radio Frequency Identification (RFID). Violino et al. [181] compared
    NFC, RFID, and blockchain-based gamification QR code. Their questionnaire and
    interview found that the QR appeared more attractive, probably due to transparency,
    incentive, and gamification. Bumblauskas et al. [126] put a QR on egg packages
    sold in four retailers. They found a 21.2% scan rate with 2 minutes 48 seconds
    visiting duration on average, which exceeded their goals in their proof of concept
    phase. This finding led to interest for further development of the system from
    their stakeholders. 3) Sensor Transmission Sensor transmission leverages devices
    to automatically gather information such as temperature, humidity, fertilizer
    concentration of the soil, or location, as seen in [126], [160], [163], [166],
    [168], [175], [180]. A system could use one or multiple sensors to reduce the
    time taken and human error when entering data. The sensor is seen as a way to
    address inaccurate data issues, which is one challenge in the blockchain application
    discussed in Section IV-A. The usage of sensors and IoT in blockchain applications
    was reviewed in [13], [14], [35]. C. How to Visualize the Data We categorize how
    traceability applications present information into five types: formatted text,
    table, timeline, graph, and map, as summarized in Table 6. In some cases, additional
    information could be visualized using other representations. We also found cases
    where a system uses multiple types of visualization. TABLE 6 Visualization Methods
    With Description and Examples 1) Formatted Text Formatted text presents information
    using texts that are arranged or structured into some patterns. Basnayake and
    Rajapakse [161], for instance, simply provided a history of organic food by listing
    the contract and owner identification number. Others grouped information based
    on stakeholders, then listed each property as a text label with detail, as visualized
    in Figure 4. The screenshot of agriculture product origins tracking system by
    Cong An et al. [167] showed information groups including product overview information
    (identifier and involved stakeholders), farmer (e.g., fertilizer and pesticides),
    importer (e.g., amount and storage address), and processor (e.g., expiry day and
    packing address). Similarly, Guo et al. [160] grouped information based on stakeholders.
    However, instead of displaying all information on one page as Tran’s, they showed
    only one stakeholder per page. FIGURE 4. An example of a user interface with formatted
    text visualization from Cong An et al. [167]. The screen shows the label and detail
    of each property, grouped by stakeholders. (Reproduced with permissions from the
    authors). Show All 2) Table Table presents information in rows and columns. The
    table could either be with borders such as in a livestock management system [174]
    (see Figure 5) or without borders such as in an autonomous coffee machine [27].
    Both examples have transactions or products as rows and properties in columns.
    FIGURE 5. An example of a user interface with table visualization from Ismail
    and Ismail [174]. The screen shows each property in a column and each transaction
    in a row. (Reproduced with permissions from the authors). Show All 3) Timeline
    Timeline presents information as a time-ordered list where items are connected
    by a line, as visualized in Figure 6. Mobile traceability applications, such as
    egg tracking application [126] and olive oil traceability application [169], vertically
    list events with a brief summarization. Alternatively, events could be arranged
    horizontally, as seen in the food traceability web application [166], which allows
    access from any device. FIGURE 6. An example of a user interface with timeline
    visualization from Bumblauskas et al. [126]. The screen displays transactions
    in order and connects them with a line. (Reproduced with permissions from the
    authors). Show All 4) Graph Graph presents information as a diagram showing the
    relation between items. We found one paper, a kiosk application for fishery product
    traceability [180], that represented supply chain events in an oriented graph.
    The author also compared the graph with the map representation, as discussed in
    the next paragraph. 5) Map Map presents information on a drawing showing geographical
    location features such as cities or roads, as visualized in Figure 7. Details
    on a map can be varied. For instance, Tradigo et al. [165] only pinned a production
    location on a map. Oliveira et al. [180] pinned and linked locations of each stage
    in a supply chain, whereas Palacio et al. [175] plotted the route that the logistics
    personnel took. Palacio’s proposed system was validated in real conditions in
    a local laboratory. However, the case study presented no details about the usability
    of the system. On the other hand, Oliveira et al. tested the usability of their
    system as well as compared the graph and map representations with 35 customers.
    They found that the participants preferred the map over the graph since the graph
    could be confusing for some users. The participants also asked for details on
    the map itself rather than the graph. FIGURE 7. An example of a user interface
    with map visualization from Tradigo et al. [165]. The screen displays the location
    of the producer on a map showing land features. (Reproduced with permissions from
    the authors). Show All We also found systems that used other visualizations to
    display additional information. For instance, Surasak et al. [168] visualized
    the temperature and humidity in a virtual gauge. Lagarda-Leyva et al. [179] displayed
    route completion time in a chart and vehicle capacity usage in a virtual gauge.
    These visualizations provided additional information for justifying food quality
    or improving supply chain processes, which could be a complement of our five visualization
    types. In case of a lot of information exist, either with one or multiple types
    of visualization, proper information organization should be considered. The usability
    study with 35 customers by Oliveira et al. [180] found some customers asking for
    sections of, for example, traceability or recipes, instead of only having one
    big page with all content. D. Other Aspects of User Interface In this section,
    we revisit the benefits and challenges discussed in Section IV and see how user
    interfaces relate to or address other points from stakeholders and traceability.
    We also include articles without screenshots or in non-agri-food supply chain
    domains, which could be a complement or potentially useful for agri-food traceability
    applications. 1) Privacy Designing blockchain-based traceability systems generally
    includes determining the privacy level - whether they are private, permission,
    or public blockchains. Still, the discussion about the selection of privacy level
    is not sufficient nor does the privacy level reflects in the user interface. In
    a general blockchain application, Cabinakova et al. [182] compared user acceptance
    of centralized and decentralized identity management systems, in which the decentralized
    system includes buttons to toggle disclosed personal information. They found that
    this control was a strong predictor of perceived transparency as well as user
    willingness to disclose data and users’ attitude. More consideration of privacy
    control of stakeholders in a supply chain could be beneficial to the traceability
    system. 2) Efficiency While Galvez et al. [8] and several works (e.g., [163],
    [164]) mentioned or used smart contracts as a way to improve efficiency in an
    agri-food supply chain, we found no works that discuss a user interface for a
    smart contract in this domain. Research of blockchain in general presents few
    works regarding user interface for smart contracts. Gul et al. [183] designed
    a smart contract interface for a user-centric business model in the blockchain.
    They suggested using a menu-based and filled form-based approach to create a smart
    contract for productivity and ease of use. Created contracts are immutable as
    they are based on blockchain technology. In practice, however, applications sometimes
    require updating of such immutable contracts. Hence, Kafeza et al. [184] proposed
    a versioning system of smart contracts using rental agreement smart contract as
    a case study. The interface included a simple form to upload the contract as well
    as a list of contract names and action buttons to, for example, deploy or terminate
    a contract. Nissen et al. [185] addressed another possibility of smart contracts
    by excluding the underlying contract from a user interface. They attached smart
    contract logic to physical locations, and the users only observed the result of
    the executed contracts through physical exploration and the changes to their balance.
    3) Sustainability Sutopo et al. [173] provided a user interface to input farmer
    and retailer data. Based on their computation, they then used data tables and
    charts to show details for improving vegetable quality and farmers’ abilities.
    Tallyn et al. [27] proposed autonomous coffee machines that allowed provenance
    of purchasing data, reducing intermediaries, and options to vote for future supplies.
    For voting, the screen showed results of supply chain analysis and used text,
    grouped as cards, to display the best supply for each criterium: “Best Quality”,
    “Low Environmental Impact”, “Best Social Responsibility”, and “Best Price.” They
    deployed the system in 3 offices and conducted a user study with 13 participants
    in the office. Their main conclusions included (1) minimizing the use of monetary
    rewards, (2) providing adequate information about the state of the machine, and
    (3) situating information about long-term thinking (such as provenance, environment,
    or value) in time and people’s routines. These findings provided implications
    for blockchain in everyday life as well as wider social structures and values.
    4) Cost and Risk Stakeholders may have limited education and required skills to
    use a blockchain-based application. Blockchain education is still immature with
    a limited number of universities offering blockchain courses [186]. Instead of
    relying on education, several papers addressed this issue by providing familiar
    interfaces to users. Bumblauskas et al. [126], for example, integrated blockchain
    with internal traceability software, hardware, and data entry from a system operator.
    Similarly, Iftekhar et al. [187] merged an enterprise-ready blockchain platform
    with existing conventional infrastructure. In a general context, Teruel and Trujillo
    [188] used a conceptual modeling approach and provided a middleware of blockchain-based
    employee schedule tracker for non-blockchain users. With the middleware, users
    could use a blockchain-based application as they did with a standard web application,
    i.e., by using usernames, passwords, and user interface elements instead of addresses,
    private keys, or transactions. They measured System Usability Score (SUS) with
    38 participants and found that the middleware was more usable and reduced task
    performance time. Rahman et al. [189] proposed a gesture-based user interface
    of a blockchain-based smart health monitoring system for elderly people or people
    with special needs. Seitz et al. [190] used blockchain to trace application installations
    on edge devices. They proposed an augmented reality that allowed user interaction
    with devices in an industrial environment. 5) Scalability One prominent scalability
    issue that relates to user interface design is latency. The limit for keeping
    the user’s attention is 10 seconds, and the limit for the user to feel instantaneously
    response is 0.1 second [191]. Cong An et al. [167] proposed a system that took
    15 seconds to create a block. Compared to the Proof-of-Work consensus protocol
    that could take 10 minutes, 15 seconds is very fast. Yet, based on the time limit
    suggestion, a user could notice the latency. In a general context, Nissen et al.
    [185] discussed that long transaction time disrupted user tasks. To address the
    issue, they added a “confirmed” for the trusted transaction and an “unconfirmed”
    for value to be updated. Their solution could be a good complement to only trying
    to improve the performance of a blockchain application. 6) Security User interface
    design related to security generally leads to the choice between public-private
    key authentication, as seen in the work by Iftekhar et al. [187], or username-password
    authentication, as seen in the work by Shaikh et al. [164]. One factor to determine
    which implementation is education and skills of the target users, as discussed
    in the cost and risk. 7) Infrastructure Infrastructure could affect user design
    choices. Idrees et al. [177] conducted semi-structured interviews with 16 farmers
    in Pakistan and found that majority of farmers have access to a smartphone. Hence,
    they designed an Android application and leveraged SMS to disseminate weather
    information. The choice of a device implies a screen size, which influences both
    how to collect and visualize the data. For instance, mobile phones usually come
    with GPS, which could be used to automatically get location data. Mobile applications
    typically prefer vertical timelines (e.g., as in [126], [169]) due to limited
    width. SECTION VI. Discussion In the previous two sections, we summarize the benefits
    and challenges of blockchain as well as categorize user interfaces, which briefly
    correspond to the benefits and challenges. In this section, we connect them together
    to determine research gaps, which researchers could address to ease the design
    process of the blockchain-based agri-food traceability applications and increase
    their usability. Overall, blockchain for the agri-food supply chain has a lot
    of potentials, which still need to be confirmed through practical implementations.
    From Table 2, seven review papers discussed the benefits and challenges of blockchain
    in agri-food supply chain application based on 119 unique references. Surprisingly,
    97 references were not picked up by our queries. A notable number of references
    came from general or other domains. This finding could imply that convincing cases
    of blockchain-based agri-food traceability are still scarce. Tribis et al. [48]
    suggested that real performance evaluation is still lacking, and from our point
    of view, user involvement and evaluation are also lacking. Compared to the traditional
    applications, fewer numbers of blockchain-based applications involved users (see
    Table 3 and Table 4). One common potential benefit and goal of blockchain-based
    agri-food supply chain applications is to provide trustworthy traceability information
    to customers. From Table 3 and Table 4, user interfaces for customers came from
    the blockchain-based applications more than from the traditional applications.
    Such customer involvement will increase the importance of user interfaces since
    customers may lack the motivation to be trained how to use the applications. Other
    stakeholders, who can be motivated by the business advantages, may also find difficulty
    in adopting this complex technology if the user interfaces are hard to use. Training
    cost tends to outweigh the design cost for better user interfaces. Blockchain-based
    agri-food traceability applications involve a relatively wide range of user types,
    while the underlying technology is relatively complex compared to other applications.
    We speculate that its nature requires additional considerations when designing
    the interface. For instance, one of the usability components involves an easy
    reversal of user errors [26], which is prevented by the immutability property
    of the blockchain. More considerations should be put on error prevention, such
    that farmers with limited knowledge of the technology may not enter incorrect
    information. Regardless, we cannot confirm the need for additional considerations.
    This is because of the relatively limited discussion about the user interfaces
    in the reviewed literature. Furthermore, most of the reviewed literature did not
    provide or provided only a limited evaluation of the user interfaces. Though the
    screenshots provide fairly rich information about the user interfaces, they may
    not illustrate all of the features of the applications. Due to this limitation,
    this paper avoids evaluating the interfaces, even by using design heuristics.
    With the current state of research, it is difficult to draw out design guidelines
    specifically for blockchain-based agri-food traceability applications. Thus, we
    suggest future research efforts to include details on user interface and design
    decisions in their works, involve users in development and evaluation, and consider
    user interfaces to enhance benefits and address challenges of the applications.
    A. More Details on User Interface and Design Decisions We found that papers rarely
    explain their user interfaces and why they designed those user interface features.
    We speculate each input and visualization type to be useful in different situations.
    For instance, five visualization types could emphasize different aspects of information:
    the formatted text could be just a simple way to present all information; the
    table could facilitate a detailed comparison of data, which may be suitable for
    supply chain management but too excessive for customers; the timeline could emphasize
    time, which should be useful for the products with a short or sensitive shelf-life;
    the graph could emphasize steps, which could be useful to oversee the supply chain
    process; the map could emphasize locations, which could be used to promote local
    specialty or detect area-based issues such as water pollution. Still, we lack
    the detailed explanation to confirm these suggestions. We encourage researchers
    to include the user interface details and design decisions so that others could
    justify whether the features are useful for their applications. B. More User Involvement
    and Evaluation We found that relatively few works reported details of user opinions
    regarding user interface or usability, though many applications originated from
    analyzing business case studies that involved stakeholders in their development.
    There are very limited evaluations and guidelines to tell how features should
    be designed. For instance, designers may want to emphasize locations on a map,
    but the information to be displayed on the map will require preferences from the
    target users. Business entities may prefer all data visible for management while
    customers may overwhelm by those data. The designers may need to evaluate different
    types of map representations (e.g., satellite and road map), similar to Violino
    et al. [181] that evaluated the label types (NFC, RFID, and QR code). As users
    in an agri-food supply chain have different backgrounds and skills, we believe
    that user study is important to find which user interface features are suitable
    for which users in which context. C. More Considerations of User Interfaces Our
    analysis in Section V could serve as a starting point for considering user interfaces
    in blockchain-based agri-food traceability applications. For instance, gathering
    inputs through forms should be more flexible but more time-consuming and error-prone
    compared to other methods. Proper form design, e.g., with autocompletion and validation,
    could reduce error and time taking to enter the information. While visual feedback
    such as percent-done indicator [192] is not the solution to latency issues, it
    helps users understand the waiting and reduce frustration. Designers may follow
    learnability guidelines (e.g., [193]) to reduce costs related to limited education
    and required skills. We believe that better user interface design could enhance
    the benefits and address the challenges of the blockchain-based agri-food traceability
    applications, thus easing the adoption of the blockchain-based agri-food traceability
    applications. SECTION VII. Conclusion Blockchain technology is seen as a way to
    improve agri-food supply chain traceability and deliver food quality, safety,
    and nutrition information to stakeholders. While there are a lot of works on blockchain-based
    agri-food traceability, relatively few works paid attention to user interfaces.
    Limited knowledge on how to design the user interface for the traceability application
    could lead to usability issues. As a step towards more usable blockchain-based
    agri-food traceability applications, this paper reviewed existing works from a
    user interface perspective. We examined 7 review papers to understand the benefits
    and challenges that the blockchain brings to stakeholders, businesses, and technology
    for the agri-food supply chain. We analyzed 24 papers containing user interfaces
    related to blockchain and/or agri-food traceability for target users and user
    interface purposes. We summarized three ways to collect the traceability data
    (form entry, label scanning, and sensor transmission), five ways to visualize
    the traceability data (formatted text, table, timeline, graph, and map), as well
    as other aspects of the user interfaces. In the end, we encouraged researchers
    to include details on user interface and design decisions in their works, involve
    users in development and evaluation, and consider user interfaces to enhance benefits
    and address challenges of the applications. We believe that better user interface
    design is one factor to widen blockchain adoption in the future. ACKNOWLEDGMENT

    Get rights and content Highlights • First literature review paper of blockchain
    technology in agri-food value chain management. • Four applications of blockchain
    technology are identified. • Six challenges for applying blockchain technology
    are identified. • Research gaps and future research directions are proposed. Abstract
    Agri-food value chain is an area of significant importance because of providing
    sustainable, affordable, safety and sufficient food, feed, fibre and fuel to consumers,
    it is critical to ensure these value chains running smoothly and successfully
    by applying advanced internet technologies. Blockchain technology is a new digital
    technological approach underpinned by the Industry 4.0 to ensuring data integrity
    and preventing tampering and single point failure through offering fault-tolerance,
    immutability, trust, transparency and full traceability of the stored transaction
    records to all agri-food value chain partners. This paper used systematic literature
    network analysis to review the state-of-the-art blockchain technology including
    its recent advances, main applications in agri-food value chain and challenges
    from a holistic perspective. The findings suggest that blockchain technology together
    with advanced information and communication technology and internet of things
    have been adopted for the improvement of agri-food value chain management in four
    main aspects: traceability, information security, manufacturing and sustainable
    water management. Six challenges have been identified including storage capacity
    and scalability, privacy leakage, high cost and regulation problem, throughput
    and latency issue, and lack of skills. Based on the critical analysis of literature,
    research gaps and future research directions are proposed in this paper regarding
    the applications and challenges of blockchain technology in agri-food value chain
    management. This study makes contributions to the extant literature in the field
    of agri-food value chain management by discovering the potential of blockchain
    technology and its implications for agri-food value chain performance improvements
    such as food safety, food quality and food traceability. Previous article in issue

    1. Introduction The agri-food value chain is a complex system responsible for
    the circulation of agri-food products from the initial stage of production to
    the final stage of consumption. In the circulation process, value chain members
    play a critical role in meeting the consumers’ demand for agri-food products and
    maintaining the quality and safety of products [1]. Simultaneously, with the rapid
    development of internet technologies in the value chain area, a large number of
    emerging technologies such as advanced information and communication technology
    (ICT) and the Internet of Things (IoT) have been applied to the agri-food value
    chain [46]. However, almost all the systems applied to the agri-food value chain
    are centralised, monopolistic, asymmetric and opaque, and may result in serious
    trust problem. Therefore, consumers’ confidence towards food safety has been broken
    after a series of food safety risk incidents and scandals over the last decades
    [46], such as mad cow disease, horsemeat scandal [2], toxic milk powder, genetically
    modified food and trench oil [3]. Consequently, detailed information of agri-food
    products from farm to fork is increasingly requested by consumers. Furthermore,
    how to build fault-tolerance, immutability, trust, transparency and full traceability
    of agri-food value chain [4], regulations and customers’ expectations towards
    food quality and food safety [5], the complexity of agri-food value chain [6],
    and the current applications of technologies and their potential issues/pitfalls
    [7] have attracted increasing attention from academics and practitioners. A potential
    solution to alleviate the above issues and concerns is usage of blockchain technology,
    which is a new digital technological approach underpinned by the Industry 4.0
    to ensuring data integrity and preventing tampering and any single point failure.
    Four special elements - decentralised, immutable, consensus, and democratic that
    are unique to blockchain networks that make the technology more attractive in
    promoting trust and transparency in the agri-food value chain fraught with errors,
    duplication and redundancies [68]. Crosby et al. [8] underlines that blockchain
    is essentially a distributed database system that records transactional data or
    other digital events that have been executed and shared among value chain participants.
    It enables agri-food value chain participants to establish a decentralized consensus
    on the sequence of events and the current status of the transaction [9]. Blockchain
    technology uses a combination of different technologies that have been applied
    in computer science such as public/private key cryptography, cryptographic hash
    functions and database technologies [10], which provides an innovative solution
    to achieve food traceability, transparency, safety and security [11]. Two prominent
    benefits of blockchain technology are that it provides a permanent transaction
    records which are grouped into individual blocks and cannot be tampered with;
    and it can replace those traditional paper tracking systems and manual monitoring
    systems, so as to prevent the traditional way of the value chain from suffering
    the inaccurate impact [39]. The academic interest in investigating the application
    of blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management has been progressively
    expanded, with a rapid increase in the contributions of academic experts covering
    this aspect [[11], [12], [13],38]. Moreover, blockchain technology used in the
    agri-food value chain seems to be a promising research stream for future research,
    especially in the era of Industry 4.0 [14,83]. However, only a limited number
    of studies analyse the current applications and future research directions of
    blockchain technology in different industries. We found three reviews concerned
    with the blockchain technology and its impact on the social and economy, drawn
    up, respectively, by Anascavage and Davis [15], who identified 16 areas that blockchain
    technology could be applied to, including food security; Tama et al. [16] acknowledge
    four areas that blockchain technology has been applied to and considers that blockchain
    technology plays an important role in guaranteeing the traceability of the agri-food
    value chain; and finally Yli-Huumo et al. [17] conducted a systematic literature
    review (SLR) on current research of blockchain technology including security,
    wasted resources, usability and privacy. These reviews are, however, relatively
    general, and given the current research and applications of blockchain technology,
    none of the reviews addresses the application of the blockchain technology in
    the agri-food value chain management. Therefore, there is a lack of up-to-date
    reviews that offer a comprehensive overview of the main issues related to current
    applications, challenges and future research directions of the blockchain technology
    in the agri-food value chain management. Considering the above arguments, the
    main objective of this study is to fill this gap by offering a systematic literature
    network analysis (SLNA) of the recent contributions of blockchain technology in
    the agri-food value chain management, highlighting the research that has been
    developed over time, and identifying the challenges of applying blockchain technology
    to the agri-food value chain management, and proposing the most promising research
    directions for the future. The remainder of this paper is organised as follows.
    The methodology adopted in this paper is described in Section 2, while the application
    of the research methodology to the context under study is provided in Section
    3. Then, the current applications of blockchain technology in the agri-food value
    chain management are presented in Section 4 followed by the challenges for applying
    blockchain technology in the agri-food value chain that are presented in Section
    5. The research gaps and proposed future research directions are presented in
    Section 6. Finally, conclusions and research limitations are drawn in Section
    7. 2. Research methodology: systematic literature network analysis Systematic
    literature network analysis (SLNA) is constituted with two methods: systematic
    literature review (SLR) and citation network analysis (CNA). The purpose of integrating
    these two existing methodologies (SLR and CNA) is to maximize the advantages related
    to each of them: SLR provides a reproducible and rigorous method that is applied
    in this study to select the most relevant and high-quality studies from previous
    literature of blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management. Through
    synthesising of the literatures, the state-of-the-art of applications and the
    challenges to apply blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management
    will be revealed. Simultaneously, why blockchain technology matters in agri-food
    value chain management is also disclosed. CNA offers an evidence-based approach
    to identifying the most-cited studies from the selected databases, revealing the
    contributions on blockchain technology theory building in the agri-food value
    chain management as well as suggesting future research directions that can facilitate
    the application of the blockchain technology to the agri-food value chain management
    [18]. The process of SLNA from the combination of SLR and CNA is shown in Fig.
    A1. 3. Applying the SLNA to the area under study The process of how to apply SLNA
    to the area of blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management is described
    in the following five sub-sections. 3.1. Formulating the research questions The
    first stage of conducting SLNA is to formulate research questions. It is important
    to have well-specified, informative and clearly formulated research questions
    to avoid bias, error and ambiguity [19]. Therefore, the research questions were
    formulated based on the following process: (1) Brainstorming all types of applications
    of blockchain technology that can be used in agri-food value chain management;
    (2) Consulting with three experts in academia and agri-food industry to evaluate
    whether it is possible to apply the blockchain technology in these areas; (3)
    Examining possible applications of blockchain technology that can be applied to
    the agri-food value chain management. Based on the above processes and principles,
    the following research questions were formulated: RQ1. What are the main applications
    of blockchain technology that have been developed in agri-food value chain management?
    RQ2. What are the key challenges for applying blockchain technology to agri-food
    value chain management? RQ3. What are the research gaps and future research directions
    for applying blockchain technology to agri-food value chain management? 3.2. Locating
    study Denyer and Tranfield [20] proposed that a comprehensive list of core contributions
    is necessary to answer the review questions by searching the most relevant and
    high-quality studies. Eight databases were selected for literature search, including
    ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Scopus, Taylor & Francis Online, Wiley Online Library,
    Emerald, Google Scholar and IEEE Xplore. The rationale for selecting these databases
    is that they include the top science and technology journals, conference proceedings
    and business research journals. Consistent with other SLR papers in blockchain
    technology (e.g. [17,21,22]), the identified keywords were used as the search
    criteria in our review. Since the aim of this research is to identify the main
    issues relating to the applications of blockchain technology in agri-food value
    chain management, a combination of “blockchain” and “agri-food value chain management”,
    with all the related terms were used for searching the title, keywords and abstract
    in the selected electronic academic databases. These keywords were combined later
    through Boolean connectors to constitute different search strings to be applied
    in the databases. Furthermore, consultation with various practitioners and academics
    in the relevant field was conducted to confirm whether search strings were also
    necessary. Finally, a total of 45 search strings were identified by the authors
    to be included in the search process. A full list of search strings is shown in
    Table 1. Table 1. Search strings for databases search. Keywords “blockchain”,
    “information security”, “information transparency”, “agriculture”, “agricultural”,

    OR “food value chain management” OR “agriculture value chain management” OR “agri-food
    value chain management” OR “agriculture trade”) 3.3. Study selection and evaluation
    As a very recent and new research area, as discussed earlier, the term of blockchain
    technology was first coined in 2008 [16]. In fact, the idea of blockchain technology
    was hardly discussed before 2008. Therefore, we use the year 2008 as the starting
    point to search relevant publications. Further, to find more relevant and important
    studies to be included in the analysis, various reference types such as journal
    papers, conference papers and book chapters were included in the systematic review.
    Simultaneously, the identification of key articles and book chapters that provide
    background information on blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management
    were found from different sources, including colleagues working in the same field.
    The initial search with the specified keywords and open access in the selected
    eight databases from 2008 to 2018 resulted in a preliminary sample of 632 contributions.
    Afterwards, each study was checked by three authors by carefully analysing the
    abstracts, introductions and conclusions to reduce any subjective bias and enhance
    validity. Moreover, relevant book chapters and other publications that were not
    covered by the databases were then identified through carefully searching the
    references used in the previous literature (e.g. [17,21,22]). The review of the
    work of influential authors in the field of blockchain technology in agri-food
    value chain management was also carried out by the same three authors. A series
    of inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied to include/exclude papers (Table
    2), which were built through a brainstorming session among these three authors.
    Studies that do not meet the inclusion criteria or duplicates or non-relevant
    studies were eliminated. As a result, 62 studies were finally selected. Table
    2. Criteria for inclusion or exclusion studies. Inclusion criteria Rationale Articles
    were published in peer-reviewed journals, conference proceedings and book chapters
    in English Peer-reviewed journals, conference papers and book chapters are considered
    to have better quality than non-peer-reviewed articles Articles were published
    between 2008 and 2018 The year 2008 was selected as the starting point as the
    term blockchain was coined in 2008 [16] The selected articles contain at least
    one keyword in their title or abstract Abstract or title focusing on the applications
    of blockchain technology was selected Judge relevance by fully reading all remaining
    abstract, introduction and conclusion The remaining abstract, introduction and
    conclusion focusing on the applications of blockchain technology in agri-food
    value chain were selected Judge relevance by fully reading all remaining articles
    Articles focusing on the applications of blockchain technology in agri-food value
    chain were selected All selected 62 studies were read entirely by the three authors
    independently. By cross-referencing all the citations and references and talking
    with experts in the experts from academia and the agri-food industry, nine additional
    studies were identified and added, resulting in a total of 71 academic peer-reviewed
    journal papers, conference papers and book chapters to be included in the analysis.
    The search and selection process is presented in Fig. A2. 3.4. Citation network
    analysis (CNA) CNA is an effective and efficient way to reveal the articles that
    represent the basis of the field and to identify which articles were used by many
    other authors for the development of their contributions [18]. The citation data
    (author, title, year, cited reference, source, time cited etc.) were collected
    from the Web of Science Core collection. Then, the software Gephi was used to
    build a citation network among the selected studies. Gephi is the leading visualization
    and exploration software for all graphs and networks, which can be applied to
    six main areas such as exploratory data analysis, link analysis, social network
    analysis, biological network analysis, and poster creation [23]. The rationale
    for this choice is that Gephi can provide large information handling capacity,
    friendly graphical user interface and high-quality output formats [24]. As shown
    in Fig. 1, a network consisting of 71 nodes was constructed. It comprises 47 connected
    components and 24 isolated components. Download : Download high-res image (822KB)

    the Fig. 1, we can see that the connected components were divided into seven clusters
    according to their citation information. For example, the orange cluster summarized
    the opportunities that blockchain technology could be applied in agri-food value
    chain management such as blockchain combined with IoT to be used in agri-food
    value chain, as well as used in agri-food value chain traceability. It is important
    to note that most of the papers included in this cluster were literature review
    papers [17,25,26]. A detailed analysis of benefits, opportunities and challenges
    of integrating blockchain technology with IoT were discussed in the cluster of
    black. There were four clusters (Light green, purple, red and blue) mainly discussed
    how to use blockchain technology to increase the agri-food value chain traceability
    and manufacturing conceptually and empirically. Simultaneously, different traceability
    models were proposed and tested. Finally, the green cluster represents how blockchain
    along with other technologies such as Big Data, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and
    Internet of Things served as an engine of the 4th industrial revolution, and how
    these technologies can revolutionize the current agri-food value chain management
    [27,28]. The detailed information of each cluster is shown in Table 3. Table 3.

    A review [45]; How blockchain technology along with other technologies such as

    has gained increasing attention from researchers and practitioners, in 2016 Yli-Huumo
    et al. [17] proposed an SLR on blockchain technology by highlighting current research
    topics, challenges and future research directions from a technological perspective.
    Their research results indicate four research gaps existing in the current study:
    (1) Lack of high-quality journal papers, most of the papers are published in conferences,
    symposiums and workshops; (2) The majority of current research is conducted in
    Bitcoin environment, rather than in other blockchain environments; (3) Lack of
    research on usability; (4) No research on the challenges for applying blockchain
    technology, such as latency, throughput and bandwidth. Following Yli-Huumo et
    al. [17], a series of research articles attempt to fill the research gaps. Tian
    [38] and Faye [39] have explored the field of blockchain technology in the context
    of the agri-food value chain from a traceability perspective. The issue addressed
    is how to embed blockchain technology in the current traceability system to increase
    the transparency and security of the agri-food value chain. With the evolution
    of research in the blockchain-based traceability system, some researchers tried
    to examine some generic models for facilitating the development of blockchain-based
    traceability system, such as the “TRADE” model proposed by Maouchi et al. [36].
    Concerns about integrating blockchain technology in the agri-food value chain
    need to be addressed from a single company perspective firstly, therefore, Hamida
    et al. [40] provided a detailed analysis on enterprise blockchains of its applications,
    challenges and opportunities. It is interesting to note that within these studies,
    the paper An agri-food supply chain traceability system for China based on RFID
    & blockchain technology proposed by Tian [38] is the most frequently cited paper,
    which has been cited 16 times by other authors among the selected papers (Table
    4). At the current stage of research in blockchain technology for traceability,
    most researchers (e.g. [[38], [39], [40]]) considered blockchain technology as
    a competitive advantage for agriculture value chain participants to gain trust
    from customers. Finally, most of these articles focus on addressing blockchain-based
    traceability system from the perspective of conceptual development. Table 4. Most

    of research examines how to combine blockchain technology with the IoT that can
    be applied in agri-food value chain management. Christidis and Devetsikiotis [41]
    noted that the combination of blockchain technology with IoT would allow agri-food
    value chain participants to get automated time-consuming workflows in a new and
    unique way, as well as to reduce significant costs in the process. Following Christidis
    and Devetsikiotis [41], many researchers have tried to contribute the theory-building
    of integrating blockchain technology with IoT from different perspectives. Hammi
    et al. [49] explored how to improve trust relationship among agri-food value chain
    members by designing a blockchain-IoT application. Reyna et al. [50] investigated
    how blockchain technology could potentially improve the IoT. Finally, Davcev et
    al. [30] proposed a blockchain-based distributed cloud/fog platform for IoT to
    enable grape value chain. The research trends on blockchain-based IoT has been
    from generally discussing the challenges and opportunities for combining blockchain
    technology with IoT to how to design a blockchain-based IoT system for solving
    the trust issues among agri-food value chain members, which facilitate to build
    a distributed peer-to-peer systems to interact with agri-food value chain participants
    in a trust and auditable manner. The trends towards stricter rules on food safety
    and food quality leads some researchers to explore potential applications of blockchain
    technology in other fields of agri-food value chain management, such as how to
    apply blockchain technology in food manufacturing [43] and how to use blockchain
    technology to increase the water sustainability [59]. Regarding the performance
    of applying blockchain technology in the agri-food value chain management, just
    a few papers measure the performance from the perspective of reducing tracking
    time to improve the traceability [4] and increasing the efficiency of the traceability
    in the agri-food value chain [13]. Simultaneously, several literature review papers
    investigated how blockchain technology has been applied in different industries
    such as agri-food industry, financial service and healthcare [8,16]. They provide
    insights on the development of blockchain technology in different industries and
    facilitate researchers to investigate how to transfer the knowledge from theory
    to practice. 3.5. Thematic analysis Braun and Clarke [51] stated that “thematic
    analysis is a method for identifying, analysing and reporting patterns (themes)
    within data, which provides core skills that will be useful for conducting many
    other forms of qualitative analysis”. Holloway and Todres [52] underlined that
    thematic analysis can be seen as a foundational approach for qualitative analysis.
    In this paper, thematic analysis was used to allow blockchain themes being generated
    by six phases of analysis: reading the whole paper collected from SLR, generating
    initial codes, searching for themes, reviewing themes, defining and naming themes,
    and finally presenting the results. Following the process of thematic analysis,
    we divided the literature of blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management
    based on the following themes: (1) current applications of blockchain technology
    in agri-food value chain management; (2) the challenges for applying the blockchain
    technology in agri-food value chain management. The detailed results from thematic
    analysis are presented in Section 4. Tama et al. [16] conducted a literature review
    on the blockchain technology and its current applications, where the majority
    of literature was concerned with the blockchain technology theory building and
    conceptual development. However, the findings in our study show that the trend
    has been gradually shifted from theory building trying to use blockchain technology
    in practice. Although the number of studies on how blockchain technology can be
    used in agri-food value chain management is increasing, there are a limited number
    of studies on how blockchain technology can be executed. 4. Current applications
    of blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management The first application
    of the blockchain technology was Bitcoin – a peer-to-peer electronic cash system
    [53]. Then, blockchain technology evolved towards smart contracts with the ability
    to provide transparency and trust to the system [41]. A smart contract is a kind
    of computer program that stores on the blockchain and executes by all consensus
    nodes in the network. It can translate contractual clauses into code and store
    them into the storage file, and operate them automatically and independently in
    a prescribed manner based on the data that was included in the triggering transaction
    [54]. Through operating the smart contracts, the need for trusted intermediaries
    between partners can be minimized and the occurrence of malicious or accidental
    exceptions can be reduced. Thus, blockchain technology has been generalized and
    applied in different domains such as finance [55], smart city [56], healthcare
    [57] and agri-food value chain [43]. However, as reviewed by Yli-Huumo et al.
    [17], more than 80% of the academic papers on blockchain technology focused on
    the Bitcoin system, while less than 20% deal with other blockchain applications.
    Although it is a relatively new technology, blockchain is rapidly advancing and
    developing. Lucena et al. [58] stated that there was a huge opportunity for blockchain
    applications to global trade. Blockchain market is estimated to grow from 210.2
    million USD to 2312.5 million USD in the period from 2016 to 2021 based on the
    Global Opportunity Report [90]. Due to its potential increase in the global market,
    it is expected that blockchain technology will play a critical role in facilitating
    future industry development and revolution. However, Poberezhna [59] argued that
    the key challenge for blockchain was to be considered as a simply disruptive technology,
    rather than as an innovative integrative solution that could provide a value proposition
    across a number of business process. In the following four sub-sections, we analyse
    the literature of the applications of blockchain technology in agri-food value
    chain management by classifying them in four distinctive themes: traceability,
    information security, manufacturing and sustainable water management. 4.1. Applying
    blockchain technology in agri-food value chain traceability According to Murki
    [60], different value chains need to embed blockchain technology in the current
    traceability system to create more agile value chains and closer customer relationship.
    Tse et al. [11] hold a similar view that the application of blockchain technology
    in the agri-food value chain may have been the optimal choice to fulfil the requirements
    of supervision and adaption of the fast-growing food market. More specifically,
    Kumar and Mallick [61] construe that blockchain technology has wider applications
    in agri-food value chain such as food delivery and shipping data records, food
    online ordering and transaction data, and food quality assurance data. To integrate
    blockchain technology in the existing traceability system of agri-food value chain,
    many researchers have tried to explore the options from different perspectives.
    Tian [38] proposed an agri-food value chain traceability system based on RFID
    (Radio-Frequency IDentification) and blockchain technology for helping Chinese
    agri-food markets to enhance their food safety and food quality during the logistics
    process. In their proposed traceability system, RFID was used for acquiring and
    sharing data in the agri-food value chain, meanwhile, blockchain technology was
    used for guaranteeing the data shared and published in this traceability system
    is reliable and authentic. However, some researchers argue that RFID technology
    and blockchain based traceability system has some defects in solving the counterfeit
    issues. For example, RFID tags can be cloned which can cause counterfeit parts
    to be circulated in the agri-food value chain [62]. To overcome the drawbacks
    of RFID, Boehm et al. [37] proposed an updated traceability system using blockchain
    technology combined with Near Field Communication (NFC) and verified users. In
    their proposed traceability system, users must provide valid user credentials
    if they want to update a product’s history on the blockchain. Thus, various changes
    of an agri-food product can be reported, and the capabilities of other members
    can be restricted at the same time. Therefore, holistic tracking agri-food products
    with higher transparency and security can be achieved. Faye [39] underlined that
    the application of blockchain technology in agri-food industry would foster more
    transparency and thus customers’ confidence towards agri-food products would be
    re-established. Although blockchain technology has great potential for revolutionizing
    current agri-food value chain traceability systems, it still has some inherent
    defects such as scalability that needs to be tackled, especially when we face
    mass data in the real world. Recent innovations in blockchain, such as scaling
    would change this working manner that requires every computer in the blockchain
    to process every transaction [63]. Croman et al. [64] argued that a scaled blockchain
    could accelerate the transaction process, without sacrificing high security, by
    determining the optimal number of computers to validate each transaction and divide
    work efficiently. Therefore, Tian [46] investigated a value chain traceability
    system based on HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point), blockchain
    technology and IoT. In their proposed new decentralized traceability system, HACCP
    was used to prevent food risk occurrences, and IoT combined with blockchain technology
    was used to continuously deliver massive real-time food-related information to
    all value chain partners in an effective, safe and efficient manner. Then, a case
    testing experiment was used to check whether the system was feasible or not. The
    research results indicate that food safety, value chain efficiency and transparency
    have been effectively improved. Badzar [65] emphasizes that openness and unchangeable
    attributes of blockchain ensure high transparency, stability and reliability of
    agri-food value chain, as well as provide liquidity, more accurate record-keeping
    and high transparency of ownership [66]. To have deep understanding of knowledge
    on how blockchain technology can be used to enhance agri-food business, Rabah
    [28] conducted a review on the applications of big data and blockchain technology
    in the agri-food industry. Their research results reveal that blockchain technology
    played a critical role in creating secure and transparent ledger that was available
    to all the involved participants within the agri-food value chain including the
    producers, manufacturers, logistics service providers, wholesalers, retailers
    and regulators. They provide insights into the effects of blockchain technology
    on the current traceability system, and facilitate the development of blockchain
    technology in the agri-food value chain management. Finally, Biswas et al. [67]
    propose a blockchain based wine value chain traceability system where every transaction
    is recorded as a block in the chain and is visible to relevant value chain members
    such as the grape grower, wine producer, bulk distributor, transit cellar, filler/packer,
    finished goods distributor, wholesaler and retailer entity. One of the most important
    features of their proposed system is that anyone can trace the purchase history
    of the wine by inputting the product ID in the system. However, their work just
    examines an example, rather than a practical application of blockchain technology
    in the wine value chain. Maouchi et al. [36] argue that although various approaches
    have been proposed to create a decentralized traceability system for agri-food
    value chain, these works do not state the feasibility of their work and their
    application for the agri-food value chain. Due to the great potential benefits
    of applying blockchain technology to agri-food value chain traceability system,
    several agricultural industry enterprises around the world have evaluated the
    effect of blockchain technology. For example, Walmart plans to invest $25 million
    over five years from 2017 to establish one food safety collaboration centre in
    Beijing to build a completely new food traceability system with blockchain technology.
    Their mango blockchain solution pilots reduced the time for tracking mango origins
    from seven days to 2.2 s, thus, more transparency and greater efficiency have
    been achieved in Walmart’s food value chain. Then, a pork value chain traceability
    system combined with barcode has been built based on the mango blockchain solutions
    [13]. Yiannas [68] states that the biggest advantage of this system is that it
    allows any trusted users to verify the traceability and authenticity of the product
    at any point of the pork value chain. Despite the increasing emphasis on applying
    blockchain technology in agri-food value chain traceability system, recent studies
    conducted by Kshetri [69] show that just a few researchers have begun to systematically
    assess the effects of blockchain technology on current agri-food value chain traceability
    system. Caro et al. [4] introduced an AgriBlockIoT traceability system for agri-food
    value chain management. It was constituted with three main components, a REST
    Application Interface with the responsibilities to integrate with the existing
    software system, a controller equipped with the abilities to query and convert
    the data records stored in the blockchain, and blockchain involved with smart
    contracts as a gateway to the blockchain itself. It is important to note that
    smart contracts can fire autonomously; hence creating records whenever anomalies
    are detected. Then, two different implementations, namely Ethereum and Hyperledger
    Sawtooth were used to do the performance analysis of traceability. Their research
    results indicate that Hyperledger Sawtooth has better performances than the Ethereum
    counterpart and may be more suitable for IoT devices, because Etherum is quite
    CPU-intensive. Based on the case study for grain quality assurance tracking, Lucena
    [58] finds out that quality measurement throughout the transportation for grains
    along the value chain is always accompanied with fraud, poor monitoring and delay
    to final destinations. Their findings indicate that using blockchain technology
    in the grain value chain traceability system is the best way at present to reduce
    disputes among business partners and information asymmetries. Finally, Kumar and
    Iyengar [70] demonstrated a blockchain based traceability framework for rice value
    chain management. In their proposed framework, blockchain was used to record all
    related issues happening within the rice value chain and monitor the security
    and quality of rice in the transportation process. It is important to note that
    all members in the rice value chain should register themselves and match their
    unique identities and digital profiles in the blockchain system. The research
    result indicates that the security of rice in the transportation process and the
    efficiency of the rice value chain have been greatly improved. 4.2. Applying blockchain
    technology in the agri-food value chain information security Under the background
    of Industry 4.0 and distributed computing, the characteristics of information
    system in agri-food industry have experienced substantial changes. Blockchain
    technology has inherent benefits such as recording transactions in real-time,
    no intermediary, immutability and distributed ledger, which becomes the first
    choice for agri-food value chain managers to enhance information security [60].
    Tse et al. [11] construed that blockchain was a well worthy technology for helping
    agri-food value chain participants to record and transfer transactions authentically.
    Leng et al. [1] proposed a public blockchain for agricultural value chain system
    along with double-chain architecture. The research results reveal that the proposed
    agricultural business resource blockchain not only can increase the security of
    transaction information and privacy of enterprise information, but also can enhance
    the credibility of the public service platform and facilitate overall increase
    of efficiency across the whole value chain system. Neisse et al. [71] explored
    a blockchain-based approach to achieve data accountability and provenance tracking.
    Their findings indicate that for the dynamic data frequently shared among value
    chain members such as the transaction record in agri-food value chain, which have
    strict scalability and performance requirements, controllers or processors should
    manage a contract that registers all subjects accepting all or part of usage conditions.
    Recently, with the advancement of IoT, machine-to-machine (M2M) connections is
    estimated to increase to 3.9 billion to 2022 [72]. More and more agri-food value
    chain participants are being equipped with interconnected electronic devices and
    protocol suites to increase the connectivity and sophisticated data gathering
    and analytics capabilities [50]. However, most of the IoT solutions are dependent
    on the centralized server-client paradigm, connecting to the cloud servers through
    the Internet [26]. Decentralised architectures such as building a large Peer-to-Peer
    (P2P) Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) may cause privacy and security issues to the
    users [73]. Thus, effective tools to ensure information security need to be supported
    by agri-food value chain participants to meet the requested security requirements.
    Currently, around 50% of agri-food practitioners have been experimenting blockchain
    technology with creating proof-of-concept, and 17% of agri-food practitioners
    have been preparing to deploy and use it in their business [74]. Hammi et al.
    [49] proposed a public blockchain-based approach in which devices can communicate
    with each other in a completely secure and efficient way by creating a secure
    virtual zone. After a series of tests, the research results indicate that the
    blockchain-based system demonstrated high resilience towards attacks. Iansiti
    and Lakhani [42] underlined that blockchain technology could provide secure, irreversible,
    distributed, transparent and accurate information sharing service. After conducting
    research on blockchain-based distributed cloud/fog platform for IoT, Davcev et
    al. [30] proposed that holistically using these blockchain-based ICT technologies
    has a positive effect in increasing the quality of agri-food products. 4.3. Applying
    blockchain technology in agri-food manufacturing In today’s highly competitive
    and knowledge-based economy, managing massive amount of information and services
    is the basic requirement for successful food manufacturers. As the information
    and services are diversified, growing in an accelerating velocity, and highly
    complex, an increase number of food manufacturers have difficulties in acquiring
    and managing them alone. Wang et al. [75] state that it is necessary for food
    manufacturers to work together and sustain their competitiveness. To address this
    issue, some researchers have started integrating blockchain concept into manufacturing
    practices. Li et al. [35] proposed a decentralized framework to manage the knowledge
    and services shared between different enterprises based on the blockchain application
    involved smart contracts and edge computing. In their proposed framework, edge
    computing acted as a foundation for providing distributed network, storage and
    computing capabilities in the manufacturing environment. The smart contracts played
    as interfaces between enterprise and its partners for successfully interact. Thus,
    a signed secure and controllable connection between the enterprise and the partner
    could be built with the transaction record and the status were updated on the
    blockchain. A case study was used to examine the effectiveness of the decentralized
    framework. The case study results indicate that manufacturers can develop scalable
    and flexible businesses at a lower cost, and ultimately the overall quality, efficiency,
    and effectiveness of manufacturing services can be improved. Furthermore, Zhao
    et al. [76], built a model of manufacturing service information based on blockchain
    principle and cloud computing, which theoretically solves the problems of sharing
    and securing the manufacturing resources, recalling the product data and guaranteeing
    the quality of the processing. Finally, Kumar and Mallic [61] reported that blockchain
    technology could be used in various perspectives of manufacturing, such as manufacturing
    management, production data, product warranty information and product assurance.
    Although blockchain technology has been seen as a critical element in the manufacturing
    sector in recent years, the role of blockchain technology for promoting resilience,
    scalability, security and autonomy of manufacturing service has been relatively
    overlooked [14]. 4.4. Applying blockchain technology in sustainable water management
    The agriculture productivity is highly dependent on water resource management.
    How to use water resources effectively and efficiently is crucial for agriculture
    development. To drive the sustainable development of water, it is critical to
    address water scarcity aspects that are deeply interrelated with agri-food development.
    Therefore, Civic Ledger [77] considered to develop a blockchain-enabled peer-to-peer
    trading platform (Water Ledger) that would allow more irrigators to participate
    in the platform that entitles and allocates water securely and transparently,
    further boosting the overall efficiency of water resources. Though creating new
    digital identity for irrigators and digitizing the water assets in agri-food value
    chain will cost a lot of money, Poberezhna [59] argues that blockchain combined
    with smart contracts can potentially help water companies and government bodies
    to access real-time data regarding market shares, consumption patterns and management
    of utility bills of consumers, thus, greater transparency to regulators and auditors
    can be achieved. Their research also indicates that recordkeeping will be significantly
    reduced when the blockchain platform is applied in water trading. 5. The challenges
    for applying blockchain technology in agri-food value chain Blockchain technology
    is still in testing phase and its implementation in agri-food value chain management
    has some issues that need to be tackled. Therefore, in this section, we will scrutinize
    the challenges to apply blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management.
    A review of the literature indicates that there are six main challenges for applying
    blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management: storage capacity and
    scalability issue, privacy leakage, regulation problem, high cost problem, throughput
    and latency issue, and lack of skills. 5.1. Storage capacity and scalability Storage
    capacity along with scalability issues have been deeply questioned in the blockchain.
    Koteska et al. [25] stated that one of the main challenges for blockchain implementation
    is scalability. To provide theoretically proven security, it is necessary to have
    a large number of full nodes (a node that can fully validate transactions and
    blocks) in the blockchain implementation. The nodes in the blockchain network
    are expected to validate each transaction of each block [50]. Otherwise, blockchain
    implementation in agri-food value chain management might result in a less decentralized
    system. Koteska et al. [25] proposed that scalability negatively affected three
    dimensions of the blockchain, the size of the data on the blockchain, the transaction
    processing rate and the latency of data transmission on the blockchain. Although
    only full nodes store the full chain, storage requirements are also significant
    [50]. For example of the Bitcoin, the blockchain is always growing with a rate
    of 1MB per block every ten minutes and store a large amount of data in every node
    that no interest for them [26]. As the number of transactions increase in the
    agri-food value chains, the amount of data becomes larger, and the loading of
    store and computing accompanied with data becomes harder, which results in the
    blockchain becoming bulky [78]. Simultaneously, every participant in the agri-food
    value chain needs to constantly store all transaction data to validate them on
    the blockchain because they need to check if the source of the current transaction
    is unspent or not [83]. Thus, with the node size increasing, additional resources
    are required by the nodes. Finally the system’s capacity scale is reduced and
    synchronization time for the new user is increased [50]. 5.2. Privacy leakage
    In the blockchain, each transaction can be traced, checked and audited and every
    user can be identified by their public key or its hash. Undoubtedly, blockchain
    technology provides a new level of transparency and helps to build trust. However,
    it also has negative effect on protecting users’ privacy [50]. Kosba et al. [79]
    stated that blockchain could not guarantee the transactional privacy even with
    the permission management because the information on blockchain was available
    to all participants who belonged to the blockchain network. Lu and Xu [80] underlined
    that every member could access all information on the blockchain because there
    were no privileged users. Maouchi et al. [36] argued that some agri-food value
    chain members might be competitors with each other and they did not enjoy the
    transparent traceability system. Therefore, many efforts for protecting privacy
    in blockchain has been done such as obfuscation on the transaction relationships
    to prevent linking or tracing analysis, hiding the identifies of the sender and
    the receiver through complicated cryptographic schemes, and blinding the transaction
    content whilst retaining the verifiability and computability [81]. In order to
    ensure transactions are not easily to be traced to any given person or computer,
    Monero [82] applies ring of signatures scheme to guarantee transactions untraceable.
    Other schemes such as Stealth Addresses, Pedersen Commitments, Ring Signature,
    Homomorphic Encryption, Zero-knowledge-proof have been used in blockchains to
    improve privacy, but no schemes can hide the sender, the receiver and the amount
    at the same time [40]. Kosba et al. [79] tackled these privacy issues differently
    through using encrypted transactions. The Hawk – a decentralized smart contract
    is responsible for translating the generic code written by programmers into cryptographic
    primitives such as zero-knowledge proofs that retaining transactional privacy.
    After researching in the wine value chain traceability system, Biswas et al. [67]
    stated that there were two drawbacks of the blockchain technology: one is the
    transaction speed; the other one is privacy as neither companies nor individuals
    would like to publish all information onto a public database. 5.3. High cost problem
    Lin and Liao [83] proposed that agri-food value chain participants would need
    a lot of money and time to embed blockchain technology in the current agri-food
    value chain traceability system. Yli-Huumo et al. [17] noted that when blockchain
    became more complex, the computational power would be another critical issue,
    as it required more computational power to confirm more blocks. Simultaneously,
    energy consumption also needs to be taken into consideration [39]. After conducting
    a case study on blockchain-based traceability system, Lu and Xu [80] pointed out
    some public blockchains inherent with a proof-of-work consensus mechanism wasted
    a lot of electricity. Most of the electricity is consumed in two different ways:
    (1) a large amount of electricity is used for the mining process, which involves
    a consensus algorithm that consists in a sort of brute force search for a hash;
    (2) another amount of electricity is consumed in peer-to-peer communications because
    it requires an edge device to be powered [26]. 5.4. Regulation problem Agri-food
    value chains are extended across the globe. Hence, applying blockchain technology
    in agri-food value chain management needs to be considered from a global perspective.
    However, blockchain is a new technology that involves different people from various
    countries without any legal or regulation to follow. Additionally, the absence
    of a central authority and the non-existent of censorship in the current blockchain
    system, this situation creates many uncertainties [50]. Atlam et al. [29] stated
    that this was a serious problem for both agri-food manufacturers and service providers.
    Therefore, it is necessary to introduce new laws or regulations to monitor and
    regulate blockchain applications in the agri-food industry for compliance [8].
    After conducting a case study on grain quality assurance tracking-based on blockchain
    technology, Lucena et al. [58] found a controversial issue when using blockchain
    technology regarding its legal value. Their research also indicates that complex
    agri-food value chain scenarios involving international trade and arbitration
    laws are yet to be proven. 5.5. Throughput and latency issue In the context of
    agri-food value chain management, due to the original restriction of block size
    and the time interval used to generate a new block, the current processing capacity
    of blokchain cannot fulfil the requirements of processing millions of transactions
    in real-time. Aste et al. [84] (p.26) stated that “a system that could handle
    large transaction volumes would require large blocks or mechanisms in which multiple
    blocks are validated simultaneously”. All the above issues will cause a big problem
    for clients when running a blockchain-based system. After investigating an RFID
    and blockchain based traceability system for agri-food value chain, Tian [38]
    stated that there were two obstacles for applying blockchain technology: (1) the
    transaction capacity of blockchain is restricted to seven transactions per second
    due to the restricted size of block; (2) how to deal with storage and synchronization
    issues with the growing size of the blockchain. Regarding latency, it is critical
    to note that current blockchain system needs some time to process transactions.
    For example, in the case of Bitcoin, block creation times follow a Poisson distribution
    with an average of ten minutes (10-minute block interval with 6-block confirmation)
    [26]. As for Ethereum, it is estimated around 3 min for 14-second block interval
    with 12-block confirmation [85]. Jindal et al. [86] construed that the time required
    for generating blocks and validating transactions is increases with an increase
    in the number of transactions. Sharma et al. [87] evaluated the performance of
    a blockchain-based distributed framework involved with Proof-of-Work algorithm
    and found that additional cost in computing sources and more processing time is
    required in case of network delays. 5.6. Lack of skills Given that blockchain
    is a new technology, a limited number of people have in-depth knowledge and skills
    about how blockchain can be used in agri-food value chain management [29]. To
    obtain general knowhow in blockchain technology and expectations of the technology
    in the context of agri-food value chain, Ge et al. [10] conducted numerous interviews
    and meetings with agri-food value chain stakeholders. They found that a considerable
    level of scepticism existed among stakeholders with low know-how of blockchain
    technology, partly due to the way blockchain was portrayed as panacea to all information
    problems, partly due to a series of technical issues that remained to be resolved.
    Therefore, Iansiti and Lakhani [42] proposed that applying blockchain technology
    in the agri-food value chain was likely to be a long process. Simultaneously,
    a widespread lack of understanding on how blockchain works in other areas also
    exists [88]. 6. Discussion: research gaps and future research directions Below,
    we summarized the research gaps and future research directions on blockchain technology
    in agri-food value chain management based on our systematic review of the literature.
    6.1. Future research directions for the applications of blockchain technology
    in agri-food value chain management The analysis of the applications of blockchain
    technology in agri-food value chain management allows us to better understand
    how blockchain technology has been applied and evolved in agri-food value chain
    management. Several directions for future research about implementing blockchain
    technology in agri-food value chain management are suggested and summarized in
    the following. • In the context of applying blockchain technology in agri-food
    value chain traceability, various researchers proposed different blockchain-based
    traceability system that involved different technologies such as RFID, IoT, NFC,
    cloud computing, and big data, as well took different agri-food value chain entities
    into consideration (see Table 5). It is interesting to note that the traceability
    system proposed by Davcev et al. [30] could provide a comprehensive function for
    monitoring the land status, vegetable status, as well as to help to achieve the
    transparent and secure agri-food value chain. Therefore, should be implemented
    in reality. However, most of the proposed traceability systems are staying in
    conceptual phase and there is little empirical research to suggest which one is
    most applicable to the reality. Additionally, just few researchers considered
    third-party regulators/authority organizations in their proposed traceability
    framework. Therefore, one of the priorities for researching the blockchain-based
    traceability system is to conduct empirical research involving third-party regulators/authority
    organizations on different context of agri-food value chains to assess the performance
    of the blockchain-based traceability system. Thus, future studies can evaluate
    the proposed blockchain-based traceability framework effects from different perspectives,
    such as computation costs, transaction processing speed, storage capability, and
    the overall efficiency of agri-food value chains. Table 5. Blockchain technology

    in the agri-food supply chain can share the same business rules and transaction
    data, transaction transparency were improved. (1) May have regulation problem
    if involved in the international trade. • There are two main areas in the literature
    for using blockchain technology to improve agri-food value chain information security:
    one is using blockchain technology alone; the other one is using blockchain technology
    combined with other technologies such as IoT (see Table 6). Obviously, double
    blockchain architecture has it unique advantages such as efficiency, transparency
    and privacy can be achieved with more data can be stored in the blockchain. Key
    technical components such as decentralized storage, mining hardware, and consensus
    mechanisms are easily to be achieved. However, it needs more effective consensus
    mechanism to deal with large amount of nodes and resources that stored in public
    service platform. Therefore, future research should investigate which consensus
    algorithm is more effective compared with others (Proof-of-Work, Proof-of-Stake,
    etc) in the same context. IoT applications have its own drawbacks such as they
    generate large volume of data and require connectivity and power for long periods.
    Besides, there are other limitations in memory, computer capacity, networks and
    limited power supply. In order to alleviate above issues, one important future
    research direction is to decide where the interactions will take place when combining
    blockchain technology with IoT, for example, inside the IoT, or blockchain, or
    a hybrid approach involving blockahin and IoT. It will need to discuss the advantages
    and disadvantages of these blockchain-IoT based applications through comparative
    analysis. This area is open for future researchers to investigate the impact and
    relative importance, and identify which one is the optimal choice to enhance agri-food
    information security. Table 6. Blockchain technology used for agri-food value
    chain information security. Authors Involved technologies Architecture Advantages

    and data would be increased Hybrid approach (1) Part of the data are stored in

    because involved more devices • Another finding of this study is a new trend of
    focusing on blockchain technology to achieve a higher level of sharing knowledge
    and services among agri-food manufacturers. Current agri-food manufacturing ecosystem
    is changing from integrated and centralized systems to shared and distributed
    systems. Most of the proposed framework for achieving higher performance were
    based on the blockchain technology and cloud computing, which aimed to provide
    a secure, low energy consumption and high efficiency systems to agri-food manufacturers.
    However, it still has some drawbacks. For example, unstable data transmission,
    lack of uniformed technology standard and low internet speed, etc. Blockchain
    technology integrated with edge computing provide a new way to achieve a higher
    level knowledge sharing performance through developing a distributed, sharing,
    standardized, and secured framework. Key technological components such as communication
    protocol, decentralized storage, smart contracts, edge cloud are all needed to
    build this system. However, there are questions remaining about the combination
    of blockchain and edge computing in enhancing overall efficiency and effectiveness
    of agri-food manufacturers. Thus, future studies should apply the blokchain technology
    and edge computing in different agri-food manufacturers using empirical and analytical
    tools to assess its effect on agri-food manufacturing. • A new trend emerging
    in the literature is the application of blockchain technology in sustainable water
    management. A few studies discussed how to apply blockchain technology to enhance
    water sustainability. However, these studies just considered how to enhance water
    sustainability from irrigator’s perspective and water company’s perspective, rather
    than taking the whole agri-food value chain stakeholders into consideration. Therefore,
    future work should holistically consider how to use blockchain technology to enhance
    water sustainability from the whole agri-food value chain perspective. 6.2. Future
    research directions for addressing the challenges of applying blockchain technology
    in agri-food value chain management From our systematic literature review, six
    key challenges emerged for applying blockchain technology in agri-food value chain
    management, they are storage capacity and scalability, privacy leakage, high cost
    problem, regulation problem, throughput and latency issue, and lack of skills.
    Although a growing body of literature is available on discussing these challenges,
    a number of challenges still exist. The purpose of this section is to highlight
    the main challenges identified in the literature and propose future research directions
    for unsolved problems. The identified solutions for the challenges of blockchain
    technology in agri-food value chain management are summarized in Table 7. • One
    of key challenges for applying blockchain technology in agri-food value chain
    is the storage capacity. Although some researchers broadly investigated several
    methods that could enhance the storage capacity, for example, store part of the
    data on-chain and part of the data off-chain [85], build a multi-layers blockchain
    architecture with different purposes [40], and develop a new algorithm involved
    deep learning concept [12] (see Table 7). It is easily to find that more computational
    power is required when implementing these solution methods. Therefore, future
    work should investigate how to appropriate solve the data storage problem without
    increasing the computational power. Specifically, integrating the deep learning
    concept or artificially intelligence concept with current algorithms such as ant
    colony algorithm to achieve computational power efficiency and systematically
    eliminate the irrelevance data of blockchain provide a new route for solving the
    storage problem. Furthermore, comparative analysis of implementing these possible
    solutions in the context of agri-food value chain should be conducted empirically
    and analytically. • Most of the researchers investigated how to solve privacy
    leakage issues from single blockchain architecture perspective, and have applied
    different schemes such as Stealth Addresses, Pedersen Commitments, Ring signature,
    Homomorphic encryption, Zero-Knowledge-Proof to protect privacy of users. Few
    researchers investigated how to protect privacy from a double blockchain architecture
    perspective, that is, one for public, one for agri-food value chain participants.
    Therefore, future work should investigate how to design and evaluate double chain
    structures for blockchain. Further, conduct experiments to check how to combine
    the above-listed data privacy schemes to maximum the performance of data privacy
    mechanisms. • As for the high cost problem, different consensus algorithms have
    been proposed by various authors such as Proof-of-Stake and delegated Proof-of-Stake
    algorithm. Though these two algorithms have various advantages such as reducing
    the computing time, less nodes will be involved in the block validation, etc.
    However, no one have conducted comparative analysis using these two algorithms
    in empirical study in the context of agri-food value chain. This area is open
    for future researchers to systematically investigate the impact and relative importance
    of different mechanisms using empirical and analytical tools. • As discussed earlier,
    blockchain is a new technology which neither has any legislations or regulations
    to follow, nor has a defined way of how to insert the implications arising from
    blockchain technology into a norm setting. Although the application of blockchain
    technology in agri-food value chain is currently still in its infancy, it can
    be expected that more initiatives will be taken by various agri-food organizations
    [10]. Therefore, more work should be taken from theory and empirical perspectives
    to check the effects of blockchain technology on the agri-food value chain, especially
    to check its effect in the international agri-food trade, and then formulate corresponding
    standards based on the research results. • As for the throughput and latency issue,
    some researchers proposed different methods to solve this problem such as implementing
    Bitcoin-NG algorithm and increase the size of each block [17,89]. However, both
    of methods are not perfect enough which will have side effects such as larger
    blocks make full nodes more expensive to operate, and the latency is limited by
    the propagation time of the network, etc. Therefore, how to choose appropriate
    algorithm and block size without side effects become very important in solving
    the throughput and latency issue of blockchain. It is necessary to holistically
    consider this problem with continually experiments and get an optimal solution.
    • Finally, concerned with the lack of skills, we did not find many publications
    that gave us clear answers on this challenge. Only Ge et al. [10] proposed two
    learning objectives for solving the challenge of lacking skills: (1) learn general
    knowledge of blockchain technology; (2) identify how to benefit from blockchain
    technology. Table 7. The identified solutions for the challenges of blockchain

    7. Conclusions In this study, we conducted an SLNA to review existing work on
    blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management. Through question formulation,
    locating studies, study selection and evaluation, we identified 71 publications,
    including journal papers, conference proceedings and book chapters. Then, we used
    software Gephi to build a citation network based on the citation data collected
    from Web of Science, which helped us to identify current trends and future research
    directions of blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management. The target
    publications of this study covered a broad spectrum of themes such as blockchain-based
    information security and traceability system, and blockchain-based water sustainability
    and food manufacturing. By synthesising the literature of blockchain technology
    in agri-food value chain management within a 10-year timeframe (2008–2018), this
    paper makes contributions to existing knowledge in three aspects: (1) The paper
    provides an overall picture of the evolution of blockchain technology and its
    application in agri-food value chains. (2) The paper elicited key challenges and
    proposed initial solutions for applying blockchain technology to agri-food value
    chain. (3) Research gaps have been identified and future research directions were

    blockchain technology is attracting significant attentions in various agricultural
    applications. These applications could satisfy the diverse needs in the ecosystem
    of agricultural products, e.g., increasing transparency of food safety and IoT
    based food quality control, provenance traceability, improvement of contract exchanges,
    and transactions efficiency. As multiple untrusted parties, including small-scale
    farmers, food processors, logistic companies, distributors and retailers, are
    involved into the complex farm-to-fork pipeline, it becomes vital to achieve optimal
    trade-off between efficiency and integrity of the agricultural management systems
    as required in contexts. In this paper, we provide a survey to study both techniques
    and applications of blockchain technology used in the agricultural sector. First,
    the technical elements, including data structure, cryptographic methods, and consensus
    mechanisms are explained in detail. Secondly, the existing agricultural blockchain
    applications are categorized and reviewed to demonstrate the use of the blockchain
    techniques. In addition, the popular platforms and smart contract are provided
    to show how practitioners use them to develop these agricultural applications.
    Thirdly, we identify the key challenges in many prospective agricultural systems,
    and discuss the efforts and potential solutions to tackle these problems. Further,
    we conduct an improved food supply chain in the post COVID-19 pandemic economy

    I. Introduction Current agricultural development and reform are calling for new
    techniques and innovations to create a more transparent and accountable environment
    in the agriculture sector. One of the emerging tools is blockchain technology.
    Unlike conventional centralized and monopolistic agricultural management systems,
    blockchain provides a decentralized data structure to store and retrieve data
    that are shared with multiple untrusted parties. In this way, it could potentially
    resolve a number of serious problems in current systems caused by the following
    reasons: (i) hackers can easily attack the centralized system to tamper data integrity;
    (ii) insider manipulation of the centralized database could compromise data integrity;
    (iii) a supply chain management system is over-reliant on the centralized database
    (single point failure problem); and (iv) high costs when involving a third party
    to verify and monitor transactions. To solve these issues, distributed database
    enhanced by advanced cryptography is proposed in the past few decades. Among these,
    blockchain is one of the most predominant emerging methods to solve trust related
    issues generated by the invention of Bitcoin in 2008 [1]. In blockchain technology,
    many advanced computational and cryptographic techniques are integrated into distributed
    data structure to achieve a digital trust system in an untrusted environment [2].
    In particular, hash function, as an algorithmic way to generate unique IDs, is
    used as the key element for data authentication. Hash values can be embedded into
    a format of stored chain to verify whether the stored data are tampered to ensure
    data integrity. Digital signature is used to verify real identities of data senders
    and receivers in stored transactions. In addition, consensus mechanism is designed
    to involve all computer nodes thus minimizing potential risks of data being manipulated
    by minority attackers. Blockchain applications in agriculture enhance diverse
    aspects in agricultural systems, especially supply chain [3] and Internet of things
    (IoTs) based systems [4]. These applications include food safety [5], food security
    [6], food quality monitoring and control [7], traceability for waste reduction
    [8], reliable operational data analysis [9] and efficient contract exchanges and
    transactions to reduce economic costs [10], thus supporting small-scale farmers
    [11]. These applications can be developed by using existing blockchain platforms
    to facilitate easy and quick developments. Based on different deployment scenarios
    of these applications, different computational and cryptographic techniques can
    be plugged to provide flexibility to meet desperate user requirements. In this
    paper, we present a comprehensive survey on the blockchain based agricultural
    applications and current innovations to promote blockchain techniques. We first
    explain basic concepts of blockchain technology, illustrate the current data storage
    ecosystem and analyze existing popular platforms by which the developed applications
    are implemented. Then we provide a comprehensive survey on diverse blockchain
    applications in agriculture related projects. After the survey, we further discuss
    the prospective of the emerging technology and how current challenges could be
    solved in deployment of the systems. Further, an illustration is presented to
    demonstrate how blockchain can be improved to build a more reliable and efficient
    food supply chain in future. This research is based on existing literature. We
    have used a comprehensive literature search strategy. We first gather all relevant
    survey papers by complying with the systematic procedure via searching the relevant
    subjects in Google Scholar and many electronic databases, including Open Athens,
    IEEE Xplore and Science Direct. The search terms used to collect the relevant
    works are: blockchain for agricultural applications, blockchain for supply chain
    management, blockchain for IoT, data integrity, traceability, provenance, and
    IPFS with blockchain. All these terms are used in multiple search combinations
    to ensure the completion of data gathering. The comprehensive literature review
    is crucial for us to answer the following three main research questions: (1) What
    are the current standard blockchain applications in agriculture related projects?
    (2) What are the main challenges that these blockchain applications face in their
    deployments? And, how could these challenges be met? (3) How blockchain can be
    improved to build a more reliable and efficient food supply chain in the future?
    The contributions of our work can be highlighted as: (i) we make an insight investigation
    of the existing applications of blockchain in agriculture and highlight potential
    uses of the technology, (ii) we suggest suitable blockchain schemes in the agricultural
    sector by an illustration of the technical details of the key components in blockchain
    technology, (iii) we further identify the key challenges in many novel agricultural
    applications and discuss alternative solutions, and (iv) we present a post COVID-19
    pandemic blockchain based supply chain system to improve the resource allocation
    when dealing with unexpected event emergency. Although there are many new blockchain
    survey papers published in recent years [12]–[21], our work provides a comprehensive
    study in the agricultural context. In the work, both technical details and applicative
    aspects are covered so that our insights could be used to suggest suitable techniques
    and platforms for individual applications in their own agricultural scenarios.
    The structure of this paper is organized as follows: In Section II, computational
    and cryptography algorithms used in blockchain technology are explained in details.
    In Section III, the latest blockchain applications are categorized and critically
    reviewed. Following the review, the challenges and prospective of combining blockchain
    with other emerging technologies are discussed in Section IV. Further, we present
    an illustration how blockchain can be deployed in a real-world scenario in Section
    V. Finally, the conclusion is drawn and future work is suggested in Section VI.
    SECTION II. Blockchain Techniques As a formal definition, blockchain is a distributed
    ledger to share transactions or sensitive data across untrusted multiple stockholders
    in a decentralized network [22]. A basic blockchain structure is illustrated in
    Fig. 1. The data are recorded in a sequential chain of hash-linked blocks that
    facilitate the data distribution in a more manageable manner comparing to other
    traditional data storage formats. The blocks are verified and uploaded into the
    chain-like system by selected nodes via an agreed consensus protocol. This consensus
    mechanism allows all the parties to engage in the monitoring process when adding
    data/information flow on-chain. In addition, the duplicates of these data are
    stored in all involving nodes to ensure their tamperlessness. In this section,
    a high-level review of blockchain ecosystem and technical details of the implementation
    are provided before the investigation of current blockchain applications in the
    agricultural sector. FIGURE 1. The data structure of a blockchain. Show All A.
    Data Storage Ecosystem Data storage and retrieval solutions are playing a centric
    role in agricultural systems. The ecosystem of data storage is illustrated in
    Fig. 2. Typical systems are still using conventional databases, such as MySQL,
    Oracle SQL and Postgres, to store and use data in a centralized way. They assume
    that data are synchronized well and shared among trusted parties. However, it
    is hard to hold the assumption in most real-world systems. Information asymmetric
    problem emphasized in [23] is a major issue to hinder the efficient allocation
    of resources in typical agricultural supply chains. As a variety of untrusted
    parties with different geographic locations are involved to generate data in a
    supply chain, it requires a more tamper-free system to protect the sharing of
    data across parties. The robust and decentralized features of blockchain offer
    one of the most suitable solutions by improving data transparency as well as data
    integrity without paying a third party to verify the process. FIGURE 2. The data
    storage ecosystem. Blockchain is playing an important role in the ecosystem. Show
    All Apart from the centralized solutions, blockchain systems dominate the distributed
    database solutions. Three types of blockchain systems are defined based on the
    accessibility and security level of applications: (1) public blockchain; (2) consortium
    blockchain; and (3) private blockchain. Public blockchain system can be joined
    by any nodes across the world with internet connection. The public blockchain
    is fully transparent so that data are difficult to be tampered by any internal
    or external attackers. However, the high decentralization trait of these systems
    generates large redundancy as well as less efficiency when considering the burden
    of sharing large amount of data. Therefore, the public blockchain is more suitable
    to applications with relatively small number of transactions (or data) to store
    into the blockchain system. Typical public blockchains include bitcoin [1] and
    Ethereum [24]. The private blockchain is deployed by a single party. It shares
    many similar characteristics to those centralized solutions but with a blockchain
    architecture. Although it is argued that private blockchain systems can be replaced
    by conventional solutions, it offers advantages over the centralized data storage
    when they are attacked by insiders. The consortium blockchain refers to a solution
    to keep data privacy and fast on-chain speed but involving more than one party
    for data storage. It is the most popular type in agricultural supply chain applications
    since having a balance performance, it fits most user requirements in this sector.
    Many blockchain platforms, such as Hyperledger Fabric [25], MultiChain [26], Quorum
    [27] and Corda [28], can be used to deploy either consortium or private blockchain
    systems. B. Blockchain Technical Components Several essential techniques, including
    hash, asymmetric cryptography, digital signature, Merkle tree and consensus are
    utilized in the blockchain design to achieve a secure ledger with decentralized
    management. Specifically, each block has a block header and a block body. In block
    header, several elements are included, such as previous block hash value, nonce,
    Merkle tree root hash, and other information, e.g., block version and Timestamp.
    Block body holds the actual data that are either transaction records or the protected
    data. 1) Hash Function Hash function is a key technique in blockchain, which is
    used for multiple purposes, including address generation, digital signature and
    consensus. Through hash function, arbitrary size data can be easily mapped to
    fixed-size values. While inversely, it is difficult to restore the original data
    from its hash value. For example, with a given large data x , its corresponding
    hash value can be obtained by irreversible hash function, Hash(x) . If x is modified
    to x ′ in an unintended manner, the hash result Hash( x ′ ) is completely different
    from Hash(x) . Two most common hash functions used in blockchain include message
    digest 5 (MD5) and SHA256 based on the complexity of data [29]. During network
    transmission, data integrity can be verified by cryptographical hash technique.
    For example, assume Alice sends data x to Bob. Along with data x , the encrypted
    hash value Encrypt(Hash(x)) , is also enclosed. After Bob receives the data, he
    can verify data integrity by calculating the hash value from received data x ′
    , Hash( x ′ ) , and comparing it with the expected hash results decrypted from
    the received Encrypt(Hash(x)) . If Hash( x ′ )=Hash(x) , it means data is transmitted
    properly, x ′ =x . Otherwise, if Hash( x ′ )≠Hash(x) , it means data integrity
    has been broken, so Bob may ask Alice to transmit the data again. 2) Asymmetric
    Cryptography To implement verifiable transaction in distributed system, asymmetric
    cryptography technique [30] is used along with hash function to enforce digital
    signature technique. In asymmetric cryptography, each user has a pair of keys,
    i.e. private key k and public key K . The private key is kept confidentially and
    known only by the owner, while the public key could be known by the others. The
    public key can be calculated from the private key, but with given public key,
    private key cannot be obtained in reverse. The public key K and the private key
    k can encrypt and decrypt data in pairs. For example, as shown in Eqn. 1, data
    x encrypted by public key K can be decrypted by corresponding private key k .
    On the other hand, data x encrypted by private key k can also be decrypted by
    corresponding public key K . Decryp t k (Encryp t K (x))=Decryp t K (Encryp t
    k (x))=x (1) View Source Targeting different security requirements, asymmetric
    cryptography can be flexibily applied. Again, assume Alice is sending data x to
    Bob, and both of them have a pair of asymmetric key. Note, Alice and Bob know
    each other’s public key whereas their private keys are only known by themselves,
    individually. To ensure confidentiality, Alice can encrypt data x through Bob’s
    public key, Encryp t K B (x) . Hence, only Bob can decrypt the data by using his
    private key. On the other hand, to ensure authentication and non-repudiation,
    Alice should send data x encrypted by her own private key, Encryp t k A (x) .
    In this case, after receiving the transmitted data, Bob can attempt to decrypt
    it by Alice’s public key. If successful, these data are indeed sent by Alice and
    she cannot deny it. 3) Digital Signature For each blockchain transaction, digital
    signature [31] is required to avoid issued transaction being modified or denied.
    Technically, digital signature is an integrated technique utilising both hash
    function and asymmetric cryptography. Like the signature for paper documents,
    a valid digital signature ensures that an unaltered data is sent by a known sender,
    which cannot be repudiated. For this purpose, the file is firstly hashed to a
    fixed length and then encrypted by sender’s private key, and the result refers
    to the digital signature of this sender. Since only nominated sender has his own
    private key, the asymmetric cryptography technique ensures authentication and
    non-repudiation of this signature. Meanwhile, because anyone can obtain the sender’s
    public key, the integrity of signature can be verified by anyone through calculating
    the hash value from the data and comparing it with the hash value decrypted from
    the signature. Moreover, if confidentiality is also required, the data can also
    be encrypted by the public key of nominated receiver. 4) Merkle Tree Once the
    number of transactions becomes larger, doing verification by downloading all the
    antiquated transactions in blockchain consumes a large amount of storage resource.
    To address this issue, Merkle Tree technique is used to reduce the storage data
    without breaking the block’s hash [32]. Merkle Tree is a binary tree consisting
    of leaf hash nodes, intermediate hash nodes and a root hash node. In each block,
    leaf hash nodes are the hash values of individual transactions. For example, assume
    there is a block with transaction data T A , T B , T C and T D . Here comes a
    Markle Tree with 4 leaves, i.e. Hash( T A ) , Hash( T B ) , Hash( T C ) and Hash(
    T D ) . As the parents of these leaves, two intermediate hash nodes, Has h AB
    and Has h CD , are calculated as follows. Has h AB = Has h CD = Hash(Hash( T A
    )+Hash( T B )) Hash(Hash( T C )+Hash( T D )) (2) (3) View Source Finally, the
    value of root hash, which is included in the block header, is calculated by hashing
    the value of intermediate nodes, as shown in Equ. 4. Has h ABCD =Hash(Has h AB
    +Has h CD ) (4) View Source To this end, by stubbing off branches of the tree,
    old blocks can then be compacted to reduce the size of the blockchain. 5) Distributed
    Consensus Schemes Byzantine general problem [33] has been raised as a trust issue
    in distributed systems. It refers to the data tamper caused by some dishonest
    nodes under the blockchain context [34]. The consensus mechanism is proposed to
    solve the problem and protect the data from minority attacks by allocating the
    responsibility of updating data blocks to random candidates selected from all
    the nodes. The popular consensus mechanisms include Proof of Work (PoW), Proof
    of Stake (PoS), Delegated Proof of Stake (DPOS), Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance
    (PBFT), and Proof of Elapse Time (PoET). PoW is the first proposed scheme in the
    bitcoin to achieve consensus in peer to peer management [1]. The nodes across
    the network compete with each other to solve a cryptographic puzzle to add the
    next block into the blockchain with a small amount of incentives. This is called
    ”mining” in blockchain based cryptocurrency. Although the scheme is remarkable
    to protect the blockchain system from malicious attacks, it is a time-consuming
    and energy consumption process. Therefore, the on-chain speed (transactions per
    second) is low in the systems by using this scheme. PoS is a mechanism to use
    validators instead of miners to update the blocks [35]. The nodes must prove their
    stakes by depositing certain amount of coins in the system. The key advantage
    of the PoS over PoW is the significant reduction of the computational power. However,
    the main issue is that the nodes who have large proportion of stakes are more
    likely to become the validators of the blocks. Delegate Proof of Stake (DPoS)
    [36] is an improved version of PoS by restricting the number of validators to
    further improve the scalability of the blockchain. Block producers are voted by
    all the users who have a number of votes calculated based on their stakes on the
    network. A block is generated if two third of producers reach an agreement. Practical
    Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) algorithm was initially proposed to target on
    the Byzantine general problem [37]. It highlights that the PBFT requires 3f+1
    nodes to make a correct decision if f nodes are faulty/dishonest nodes in the
    network. The algorithm has been adopted into a blockchain system as one alternative
    consensus scheme [34]. In the scheme, a block proposer is first selected based
    on a robin-round manner. The proposer will then broadcast and collect 3f+1 nodes
    in the network. If two third of the validators agree on a block proposal, the
    block is valid to commit into the blockchain. Proof of Elapsed Time (PoET) is
    a more efficient mechanism compared to other consensus schemes [38]. It was developed
    by Intel on top of the SGX technology. After signing attestation, each node participates
    in a randomized lottery selection by receiving an object timer from the trusted
    code. The node who wakes first will lead the next block creation. However, the
    SGX is made by Intel which is a third-party company. This has a potential to compromize
    the principle of blockchain to remove the intermediaries. Overall, consensus scheme
    design is still an open challenge in blockchain research [39]. The selection of
    the scheme relies on the application context to balance the block on-chain speed
    as well as the robustness to against various types of attacks. C. Blockchain Generation
    Process Blockchain data on-chain process has several stages to secure data integrity.
    An example of a transaction record on-chain process is illustrated as follows:
    Stage I:Before each transaction, payee address is firstly generated, and the payer
    makes payment to that address. After the payer finishes the payment, the transaction
    is digitally signed by both the transactions parties and broadcasted to all the
    participants (i.e. peers) in the network. From the participant side, after receiving
    a new transaction, the transaction is firstly verified, and if valid, collected
    into a block. Stage II:Every participant packs the collected transaction records
    during a period into a block, and make an effort to upload his block to the blockchain.
    Regarding which participant can stand out from the peers, various distributed
    consensus schemes are introduced in previous section. Stage III:When the new uploaded
    block is connected with the existing chain, it is broadcasted to all the other
    participants in the network. After receiving the block, other participants can
    verify all transactions in the block to ensure data integrity. Since each block
    in the chain requires the hash value of the previous hash, the participants can
    express their acceptance of specific chain by using its hash to create the next
    block. With repeating these stages, all the data can be stored in the decentralized
    database sequentially. It provides a transparent environment for all the stakeholders
    so that a trusted system is built across the network. SECTION III. Blockchain
    Applications in Agricultural Sector During recent years, blockchain has attracted
    significant increasing attentions in agricultural sector. This trend is driven
    by the major concerns in several important aspects, i.e. food contamination and
    fraud issues [40], data security and safety in smart farming [41] and IoT based
    precision agriculture [3], trust and efficiency issues in financial transactions
    in the agricultural supply chain [42] and data transparency and integrity of agriculture
    related information management systems [43]. The regulation and governance seek
    for more innovations on adopting blockchain techniques to achieve better data
    transparency and accountability with flexible, costly and sustainable solutions.
    As illustrated in Figure 3, all the stakeholders involved in agricultural production
    and transaction can secure their data integrity in blockchain based systems. Thus,
    users have high confidence when using the products or the services offered by
    them. FIGURE 3. Agricultural stakeholders, including producers, logistic companies,
    manufacturers, retailers and financial institutions, can be involved to create
    blockchain applications to build up trust of data users, e.g., goverment supervisors,
    consumers, and other AI and machine learning based systems. Show All A. Application
    Categories In this subsection, a comprehensive investigation has been made to
    identify how the blockchain technology are deployed to achieve efficiency and
    integrity of agricultural applications. Based on these targeted issues, we categorize
    uses of blockchain into four groups: (i) provenance traceability and food authentication;
    (ii) smart farming data management; (iii) trade finance in the supply chain management;
    and (iv) other information management systems. 1) Provenance Traceability and
    Food Authentication: The most popular use of blockchain technology in agriculture
    is the traceability and provenance function in product supply chain management.
    It is the most efficient way to enhance food safety, and reduce fraud and food
    scandals since all relevant data related to the product origin and its movements
    can be stored with minimal tampering risk [44]. When each product item is produced,
    a corresponding digital token is attached to the item in order to ensure that
    it is tracked at a real-time manner. The developed applications include tracing
    Pork and Mango sold in Walmart supermarket [45], egg distribution from farm to
    the fork at midwestern U.S. [46], Brazilian grain export [47], the certificate
    verification of table grape shipped from Africa [48], the use of RFID tags to
    trace cold chain food [49], and the use of IoT sensor to trace products in supply
    chain [50]. Walmart is one of the pioneers to deploy blockchain on food traceability
    [45]. It worked closely with IBM to deploy two pilot studies by using Hyperledger
    Fabric. These two studies include the traceability systems for pork in Chinese
    market and mangoes in the American market. E-certificates including agricultural
    treatments, ID numbers, manufacturers, security issues, permissions and safety
    related records are all stored in the log files. With blockchain technology, procurement
    managers can trace all the information online in time, so that they can easily
    pinpoint the individual tainted products without recalling all the products. The
    systems can not only make the safety traceability much more quickly but also cut
    the recall cost by allowing to trace the items instead of batches [45]. Data and
    transactions collection procedure in the blockchain traceability systems are designed
    based on requirements of the applications. In [51], different event types defined
    in the Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) specification [52],
    including ObjectEvent, AggregationEvent, QuantityEvent and TransactionEvent, are
    uploaded into the blockchain to ensure the better information traceability as
    the items and their main transaction events have unique codes. In [48] and [53],
    certification documents of the products are embedded into the transactions to
    satisfy the compliance with health and safety regulations. In other traceability
    systems, such as [49] and [50], using IoT sensors or RFID tags to automate the
    data collection could further reduce the manual mistakes for data integrity and
    improve the efficiency of data on-chain process. 2) Smart Farming Data Management
    In addition to the previous mentioned traceability systems, IoT techniques have
    also been widely used in smart farming for better productivity control and management
    [54]. In these IoT sensor-based systems, management and control decisions are
    made based on data collected from sensor networks. In [55], robotic swarm control
    is proposed as a key concept in future smart farming and precision agriculture.
    Simply put, UAVs and land robots could make either distributed or collaborative
    decisions based on data collected from robotic swarms and communications between
    them. Thus, data privacy and integrity are the most important component in such
    systems. There exists an increasing trend of migrating IoT network data from centralized
    database to blockchain systems for many applications [56], [57]. Many agricultural
    projects have benefited from the convergence of IoT and blockchain techniques.
    For example, IoT based irrigation systems are proposed in [58] and [59] and blockchain
    is deployed to keep sensing data privacy and integrity. In [60], a private blockchain
    is adopted to secure monitoring and control data in a fish farm so that all the
    control decisions are accountable. In [61], Kawakura et al. uses Corda to build
    an IoT data recording system to store data that farmers operate hoes with small
    data transaction time-delay. With the analysis on these data, farming operations
    can be optimized to increase productivity. In these applications, farmers can
    build up their trust on the automated controllers as all decisions are accountable.
    3) Efficiency Improvement of the Trade Finance in the Supply Chain blockchain
    was originally proposed to improve the financial efficiency, and reduce transaction
    cost by removing intermediaries and audit cost via improved accountability in
    trading business process [72]. This feature is powerful to support small scale
    farmers who are suffering from high cost of trade transactions and accidental
    losses caused by environmental disasters or other uncertainties [73]. Therefore,
    the straightforward use cases of blockchain in agriculture is to explore its financial
    functions to make these agricultural producers profitable. Many agriculture related
    companies are developing blockchain systems to support trading parties in supply
    chain management. In [23], an integrated food trading systems with consortium
    blockchain, called FTSCON, was built to facilitate costly and easy trading of
    agricultural products in Shandong province, China. Based on the trial between
    2014 and 2017, it was found that the total profit of different enterprises in
    the region increased significantly. In [64], a detailed solution of implementing
    a trading system in soybean supply chain was presented. It emphasized that this
    system could provide proof of delivery, automated payments and dispute handling.
    In [66], a case study was made by CBH group in Australia to secure the seven days
    payment terms via a Quorum based blockchain system. The blockchain technology
    is also under development to support agricultural finance by many financial institutions
    and commercial banks. In [67], several case studies of blockchain systems which
    were jointly developed by banks and IT companies to illustrate that the blockchain
    systems provided the letter of credit from the banks efficiently to speed up the
    trading process with much shorter period. In [65], State Farm and USAA jointly
    developed a system to facilitate the automatic insurance claims from farmers to
    reduce the fraud risk as well as improve the claim efficiency. All these innovations
    have motivated farmers to produce more products by increasing their profit margins.
    4) Other Agriculture Related Data Management Systems blockchain technology is
    considered as the next generation information infrastructure promoted by many
    countries [74]. It has made significiant impacts on both industrial and research
    projects. In food manufacture industry, a food quality monitoring system is built
    by combining smart contract and evaluation models to increase reliability of peach
    juice production process [68]. On the agricultural research side, it is also calling
    for more transparent ways to increase confidence on research results when multiple
    collaborators are involved in a project. For example, food science research society
    proposes to use blockchain to store and share collected research data [70]. Blockchain
    based systems have also been deployed in many other agriculture related information
    management systems as the backbone infrastructure. For example, in [69], a decentralized
    ledger-based contract management system is built to provide legal protection of
    the temporary agricultural workers in Italy. In addition, the payment of the salary
    can be settled via the cryptocurrency in this integrated system. In [71], Plastic
    Bank uses a blockchain based token to encourage the plastic waste collection and
    recycle to provide an innovative solution for agricultural land cleaning. B. Application
    Platform As many cryptographic techniques are used in blockchain technology, it
    is a time-consuming task to build a blockchain system from scratch for practitioners
    and researchers. As a result, many open source and commercial platforms are provided
    to simplify and speed up the decentralized application (DApp) development in agriculture
    related projects. The predominant platforms used in these blockchain practices
    are discussed as follows. Ethereum was initiated in 2014 and it is the most active
    blockchain platform in the world for blockchain practitioners and researchers
    [24]. It is a permissionless blockchain that is friendly to public blockchain
    based APP development. The access control can only be added via the smart contract
    that is limited. Many proof-of-concept agricultural traceability systems, such
    as [49], [51], [62], [63], finance trading systems, such as [23], [64], and some
    information management systems, including [68], [69], are deployed on top of the
    platform. However, there are some disadvantages of using the Ethereum platform
    for development: as shown in Table 2, the platform uses PoW as its consensus scheme,
    thus the on-chain speed is relatively low, i.e. ~20 tps [75]. Another constraint
    for DApp development on the platform is the cost when committing data and transactions
    on the blockchain via ETH gas, a unit to measure the computational use [76]. When
    building a system with intensive on-chain data, it is not economic to use this
    platform. Hyperledger is endorsed by Linux foundation to provide several distributed
    ledger frameworks, e.g., Fabric, Sawtooth, Indy, and Burrow [77], for the enterprise
    level blockchain development. In these frameworks, Hyperledger Fabric [25] and
    Hyperledger Sawtooth [78] are the two most popular platforms for the development
    of the agricultural related projects. The examples include [45], [47], [53] by
    using Fabric and [46], [50] by using Sawtooth. The default consensus scheme in
    the Fabric is PBFT while in the Sawtooth, PoET is set as the default consensus
    scheme. In addition, these are flexible to adopt any other schemes to further
    improve the on-chain speed efficiently. Regarding the performance, both platforms
    have higher on-chain transaction throughput comparing to the Ethereum. In [79],
    it uses Fabric to achieve 20,000 tps with delegate design of the architecture.
    The difference between these two platforms is that Fabric supports permissioned
    blockchain but Sawtooth support both the permissioned and permissionless blockchain
    development. Thus, the use of Hyperledger frameworks is increasing significantly
    in agricultural applications. Quorum was created by JP Morgan to target on enterprise
    level blockchain systems [27]. It provides an Ethereum based platform to support
    applications of finance, supply chain, and retails with extra protection on the
    privacy of transactions and contracts. The transaction data are encrypted to preserve
    data privacy. In addition, it offers centralized enforcement on the access control
    so that it is more suitable for private/consortium blockchain systems. Although
    the platform is built on top of Ethereum, it uses either Raft [80] or Istanbul
    BFT [81], as its consensus scheme. Therefore, the average transaction speed can
    reach ~500 to ~700 tps in average [27]. Examples of agricultural systems developed
    by using the platform include AgriDigital [66] and insurance claim [65]. TABLE
    1 A Comprehensive List of Blockchain Based Agricultural Systems and Their Implementation
    Platforms TABLE 2 Table to Summarize the Main Features and Attributes of the Popular
    Blockchain Platforms to Deploy Agricultural Applications Although there are many
    other platforms for blockchain based system development, such as Multichain [26],
    R3 Corda [28] and BigChainDB [82], these four platforms have been widely chosen
    for the deployment of agricultural systems. The main features and attributes of
    these platforms, including transaction throughput, consensus, supported smart
    contract languages, state database and access control, are summarized in Table
    2. In addition, a more comprehensive list of agricultural projects by using these
    platforms are presented in Table 1. C. Smart Contract 1) Smart Contract and Its
    Implementation Smart contract refers to a computerized program which is consisted
    of states, values, addresses and logical functions that are required at the business
    model layer in a system [83]. The idea was initialized by Nick Szabo in [84] to
    automatically execute contracts to improve efficiency of business models involved.
    As illustrated in Fig. 4, smart contract plays a key role in a blockchain system
    implementation. In specific, once it takes the transaction requests as input to
    trigger the business logic, it uses defined policy to get the endorsement from
    peers in the blockchain network. After receiving all the endorsements, it calls
    the ordering services to verify the endorsement and add the verified transactions
    into blocks of the blockchain. The records stored in the blockchain is immutable
    so that no one could tamper the on-chain data. In addition, DApps can query the
    states of accounts or transactions via the smart contract. FIGURE 4. Smart contract
    plays an important role in transaction endorsement and verification. Show All
    To support the fast blockchain application development, most blockchain platforms
    support the programming of smart contracts to fulfil the different business logics
    behind these applications. Ethereum platform and its extension platform Quorum
    provides Turing complete smart contracts: they compile either Solidity and Serpent
    code into Ethereum virtual machine (EVM) bytecodes and the EVM takes responsibility
    to track state changes to ensure Turing completion. As the most active platforms
    in Hyperledger family, Hyperledger Fabric and Sawtooth uses Golong, Java, Python
    and Javascript as the main programming languages for smart contract development.
    2) Challenges of Smart Contracts The challenges of smart contract is the key focus
    when blockchain technology is deployed in agricultural systems [93]. In [94],
    these challenges are summarized based on the smart contract life cycle, which
    includes creation, deployment, execution and completion stages. In the creation
    stage, function and readability issues are faced by the developers and practitioners.
    Developing human readable code and achieving expected functionality are crucial
    for accountability of smart contracts. Further, good smart contract design could
    solve the problem of under-optimized code, which could lead to extra costs in
    transactions, or under-priced operations resulting denial of service (DoS) attacks.
    In the deployment stage, contract correctness and control flow are two major factors
    that ensure high quality of smart contract. Many methods, such as bytecode analysis
    [95], formal verification [96], and graph-based analysis [97], are proposed to
    check correctness and control flow of smart contracts for deployment. In the execution
    stage, execution efficiency of smart contract must be garanteed. In [98] and [99],
    concurrent execution of smart contracts by proposing Software Transactional Memory
    based approaches can significantly improve the execution efficiency. In the final
    completion stage, security of smart contract is the most crucial factor. As discovered
    in [95], 8,833 out of 19,366 smart contracts deployed on Ethereum have serious
    security bugs that can be easily exploited. Further, 12 types of vulnerabilities
    in smart contracts are summarized in [100]. Nevertheless, it is difficult to reduce
    these secruity risks and vulnerabilities without automated tools due to the diverse
    levels of blockchain programmers. Therefore, many security analysis tools, including
    SECURIFY [101], OYENTE [95], or SMARTINSPECT [102], are developed to ensure high
    level of smart contract security for the developers [103]. For example, a decentralized
    smart contract system, the Hawk [104], provides a promising solution to compile
    a contract into a cryptographic protocol automatically. For another example, in
    [101], a publicly released security analyzer for Ethereum smart contracts is developed
    as a fully automated tool to prove whether contract behaviors are safe. D. Technical
    Review of Innovative Agricultural Blockchains Recently, blockchain technologies
    have been integrated with many other advancements in IoTs, cloud computing and
    cloud storage to provide better services in agriculture. The convergence of blockchain
    and IoT, which is defined as Blockchain of Things (BCoT) in [105], has become
    one of the most useful frameworks in blockchain applications. In many data intensive
    applications, e.g., tracking and recording continuous signals from IoT devices,
    achieving optimized performance is challenging. This is due to various theoretical
    limitations and bottlenecks of blockchain. For example, conventional blockchain
    systems have a low on-chain speed due to their decentralized feature and consensus
    schemes [106]. Once the volume of real-time captured data are higher than transaction
    capacity, low throughput hinders the practice of blockchain technology. Thus,
    many novel agricultural blockchain systems with technical innovations are proposed
    to ensure better integration to enhance data throughput, security and fast retrieval
    of the shared data in agriculture sector when keeping the main features of blockchain,
    i.e. traceability, immutability, and data integrity. Some key studies are highlighted
    in the Table 3. These studies are categorized into three areas. TABLE 3 A Summary
    Table of Representative Technical Innovations in Agricultural Blockchain Applications
    First, many studies aim to improve the underlying elements of blockchain technology,
    focusing on the following key ideas: (1) nodes are grouped into clusters to improve
    the scalability of the BCoT architecture [87], [88]. In [88], Qu et. al. propose
    the reduction of data storage to tackle scalability related issues. It clusters
    the nodes into geometric groups so that data partitioning scheme can be deployed
    to reduce data redudancy. (2) Double chain architecture is used to store data
    in different types of blockchains [51], [85]. In [85] and [51], DoubleChain, a
    hybrid system of on-chain and off-chain data storage, is proposed to solve the
    throughput bottleneck. (3) smart contract filtering algorithm is designed to reduce
    the on-chain data. For example, in [60], a smart contract-based data filtering
    algorithm is proposed to build a blockchain based fish farming solution on top
    of a legacy database system. With the filtering algorithm, only important data
    are uploaded into the blockchain blocks. (4) consensus schemes that are too complex
    to be handled well in large IoT networks are improved to further boost blockchain
    performance. In [87], a Distributed Time-based Consensus algorithm (DTC) is proposed
    to reduce the processing overhead. While in [23], Mao et al. design an improved
    (iPBFT) scheme to make the consensus better suited for relatively higher throughput.
    Secondly, combining different data storage techniques is another important strategy
    to tackle the exponentially increasing data storage used in many agricultural
    applications. InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is a peer-to-peer distributed
    data storage system in which data content is stored in distributed peers and its
    hash value is used to ensure data integrity [107]. The combination of IPFS and
    blockchain has become a popular approach to tackle the weakness of blockchain
    technique to store large amount of data [64], [89], [90]. For instance, as multimedia
    data have increased significantly in agricultural applications, IPFS has been
    used in [64] to store videos and images to complement with blockchain so that
    the multimedia evidence, including images and MPEG videos, can be stored securely
    to resolve rebuttals in soybean transactions. In addition, mixture with decentralized
    database cluster is another option to solve the high volume storage problem. In
    [91], Golden Seed Breeding Cloud Platform (GSBCP) is designed to ensure the safe
    storage of crop breeding. A decentralized database cluster is used to store the
    raw data collected from multiple sensors; and the database addresses and relevant
    metadata are uploaded into the blockchain, thus maintaining data integrity. Thirdly,
    blockchain privacy and security is another focus of recent research. In many agriculture
    related applications, enhanced privacy and security components are added in their
    systems, e.g., [86], [91], [92]. In [91], the summary of breeding data is encrypted
    by using proxy encryption server before uploading into the blockchain. In [86],
    an improved partial blind signature algorithm is proposed to protect data privacy.
    In [92], an architecture with decentralized access control is proposed to enhance
    security of IoT device data. SECTION IV. Challenges and Potential Solutions The
    major technological challenges can be summarized as the following aspects: (i)
    scalability issue when integrating with data intensive technology, such as IoT.
    The throughput of blockchain is much lower than the conventional centralized databases,
    which can achieve tens to hundreds of thousands of transactions per second. Therefore,
    the data-intensive applications, e.g. monitoring and controlling farming by sensor
    network, require fast storage speed and low network latency; (ii) integration
    with existing legacy systems. Many organizations have deployed their own management
    systems for years and it is hard to migrate their entire systems to the emerging
    blockchain which could cause disruption to their current services; and (iii) security
    and privacy. Blockchain encourage the decentralized infrastructure which increases
    the data transparency but compromise the data privacy. Although most recent blockchain
    platforms allow the uploading of encrypted transaction records on-chain, more
    security features would enhance the data security and privacy to a higher level
    due to various types of attacks [108]. Based on the technical innovations discussed
    in the previous section, the potential solutions for solving these challenges
    are summarized and illustrated in Figure 5. FIGURE 5. The alternative solutions
    to target on several challenges in state-of-the-art frameworks. Show All As illustrated
    in Figure 5a, the use of a hybrid architecture solution by combining centralized
    databases or other data storage systems with blockchain is proposed in many studies
    [85], [91], [109], [110]. Although some applications focus on designing light-weight
    data structure to reduce the on-chain data amount [51], [86], the mixture and
    links of blockchain with other storage systems, such as IPFS, provides a more
    scalable and sustainable way to deal with the exponential increase of data that
    most modern storage solutions are facing. The hybrid architecture can solve the
    demand of high throughput data storage requirement while maintaining data integrity.
    Integration with legacy systems is another challenge when promoting blockchain
    technology in agricultural organizations. In [13], it is highlighted that the
    blockchain systems are difficult to seamlessly integrate with legacy systems.
    We believe that the popular use of cloud services in most enterprises could potentially
    solve this issue. As illustrated in Figure 5b, when data from legacy systems in
    individual companies are uploaded in cloud services, service providers can easily
    extend their services to blockchain based systems if any business needs are proposed
    between multiple parties. In addition, the organizations could save the cost to
    enhance data privacy and security as the risks could be efficiently controlled
    and managed by the service providers. To further enhance blockchain privacy and
    security, an infrastructure level solution is more suitable for tackling the challenge.
    As illustrated in Figure 5c and 5d, two types of blockchain structure changes
    could potentially enhance data privacy and security. In Figure 5c, a hierarchical
    blockchain based system is proposed as the private blockchain has better characteristics
    to maintain data privacy. Only data required by legislation or regulation bodies
    are stored into a consortium blockchain. Figure 5d offers another enhanced version
    in Figure 5c. It uses efficient chain-to-chain communication technology to remove
    the consortium blockchain, thus further maintaining data privacy in private blockchains.
    Of course, the communication scheme across multiple private blockchains need be
    secured as proposed [111]. In addition to these technical challenges, there are
    other challenges in environmental, social and organizational aspects [112] to
    promote blockchain technology in agricultural sector. There are still lack of
    regulatory and legal requirements to reinforce the deployment of blockchain based
    systems. Thus, some enterprises are reluctant to adopt the technology if their
    current systems can satisfy their business needs. Further, it requires knowledge
    and skills on both agriculture and blockchain to develop these applications. However,
    it is predictable that the use of blockchain to build trustable systems would
    be predominant in many countries and these challenges would need to be addressed
    in near future [113]. SECTION V. An Illustration of Essential Food Supply in Post-COVID-19
    Pandemic In this section, we present an illustration to demonstrate a blockchain
    based food supply chain management system in agricultural applications. The ongoing
    COVID-19 pandemic has brought a huge crisis on the global food supply [114] despite
    many existing blockchain systems in agricultural supply chain. During this period,
    shortage of essential food, such as rice, fresh vegetables, flour, and eggs, has
    caused panics among suppliers and shoppers due to disruptions in supply networks.
    Producers, manufacturers and distributors have limited information when customers’
    shopping behaviours change abruptly. It takes weeks, even months, to adjust resource
    allocation in order to recover the operations of food product supply to a normal
    level. Further development of blockchain based supply chain systems is required
    to improve the situation by tackling issues related to asymmetric information.
    There are at least three key lessons that we could learn from COVID-19 related
    global food supply disruptions. These include: (1) we need real-time accurate
    information for parties involved. When panic buying occurs, the supply network
    lacks of accurate information to reflect the purchase behaviours, thus making
    quick responses impossible. (2) More efficient coordination among parties at a
    global scale is necessary in order to generate quick and appropriate responses
    in real-time. (3) Efficient process is needed to reduce time in bureaucracy procedures.
    These lessons motivate us to reform the existing blockchain based supply chain
    systems to provide better services in future. As shown in Figure 6, we illustrate
    an improved blockchain based supply chain system that can be deployed in post
    COVID-19 era. The blockchain technique will be seamlessly integrated with machine
    learning methods to achieve a more efficient system. Like other existing blockchain
    system, the provenance of products, including essential information and certificates,
    is stored in the blockchain for traceability. In such a system, retailers are
    information consumers not providers. In this improved system, the main distinctive
    and unique feature is the integration of retailer and customer data into the blockchain.
    Insight analyses of key weaknesses of current supply chain management systems
    have identified that the involvement of these retailer/consumer data is valuable
    to boost the effectiveness of the blockchain based system. If shopping data can
    be uploaded into the system, up-chain parties, including producers, manufacturers
    and logistic companies, could explore these data for better coordination and resource
    allocations. Thus, a closed loop could be formed when retailers/customers’ data
    are stored into the blockchain. The main features are highlighted as follows.
    FIGURE 6. Use Case - Improved post-COVID-19 blockchain based supply chain solution.
    Show All Using AI based retail sales prediction to reduce on-chain data. Retail
    forecasting has offered an oppotunity to optimize retailers’ planning to maximize
    their profitable margins by setting reasonable inventory level based on popularity
    of products [115]. Recent research has shown some extent of success in product-level
    demand forecasting at a high granularity level. The demanding prediction of products
    can be integrated as a filtering method to reduce on-chain data of the proposed
    blockchain system. In Algorithm 1, the pseudocode of data registration function
    in RetailerData smart contract is used as an example to show how data collected
    from retailers can be uploaded on the blockchain system. Here, the AL refers to
    the authentized list that all registered retailer units can upload their data
    to improve the up-chain strategical optimization, and the p refers to individual
    products that supply process need to be optimized. With an AI module filtering
    normal sales prediction, the on-chain data can be reduced significantly. At the
    same time, any anomaly or significant customer behaviour changes are recorded
    into the blockchain so that up-chain parties could explore the data for efficient
    planning. SECTION Algorithm 1 Data Registration Function in RetailerData Smart
    Contract Input: Message sender (msg.sender), authentification list (AL) of retailer
    units, product object (p) including all sales infomation of the product, current
    time (t). Output: Data registered 1: if msg.sender ∈ AL && abs(p.real_sale−ai_module.predict())>th
    then 2: register(msg.sender,p,t) 3: else if msg.sender ∈ AL then 4: register(msg.sender,p.id,normal_flag,t)
    5: else 6: Revert contract state and show error 7: end if 8: return p The blockchain
    retailer data facilitate better planning and operation of upchain stakeholders,
    such as suppliers, manufacturers and logistic companies. As illustrated in Fig.
    7, up-chain parties could request these retailer data to feed into their AI modules
    to optimize their planning and operations. For examples, logistic companies could
    request data of retailer units and their demands of products to make routing optimization
    based on the geographic distribution of demand; manufacturers could use the data
    to adjust their raw material processing to meet urgent market demands; and farmers
    could make better planning for future productivity. FIGURE 7. The retailer/consumer
    data are important to improve efficiency of the food product supply chain. Show
    All The blockchain retailer data improve work priority of government and regulation
    bodies. As illustrated in Fig. 7, once government and regulation bodies have the
    permission to access regional data on demand, policy makers could set priorities
    and coordinate with all involving parties more efficiently to deal with unexpected
    events like COVID-19. Further, as shown in Fig. 6, quality control agents and
    food administration agency could work closely with producers and manufacturers
    so that a lengthy quality monitoring and auditing process can be simplified. SECTION
    VI. Discussions and Conclusion Blockchain technology, as a part of the emerging
    e-agriculture system, is reshaping the whole sector to solve food crisis in new
    century. It plays key roles from the farm to the folk in many aspects: it ensures
    data privacy and integrity by combining smart farming and precision agriculture
    techniques to improve farm productivity; it creates a more efficient food supply
    chain by establishing trust among involving parties, thus simplifying the process;
    and the last not the least, it enables farmers to maximize their profit via a
    trusted platform. Overall, it adds great values to all stakeholders in the entire
    agricultural sector. In this paper, to promote blockchain techniques, especially
    their various uses in the ecosystem of agricultural products, we have presented
    a comprehensive survey on current blockchain based agricultural applications and
    innovations. We have explained various concepts of blockchain technology, including
    its data storage ecosystem and its several popular application platforms. We have
    offered a detailed investigation of desperate blockchain applications in the agricultural
    sector. Then, we have considered several key challenges in the current use of
    blockchain related technologies in agricultural applications and provided some
    possible solutions. These challenges include: (1) scalability, (2) integration
    with existing legacy systems, and (3) security and privacy. Simply put, our suggested
    solutions can be viewed in a holistic fashion as a redesign of the system architecture.
    Further, we have indicated possible future developments and applications of blockchain
    in this sector via an illustration, i.e. the current COVID-19 global food crisis.
    In future, we wish to provide further discussions on various aspects of blockchain
    and explain in detail how current challenges as indicated in this paper can be
    resolved in future development of blockchain in agricultural systems. Potentially,
    our illustration could be further extended to be a much fuller case study, which
    could then be evaluated via a series of emperical tests. Authors Figures References

  explanation: '**Blockchain-based traceability solutions** in the agriculture sector
    focus on recording the movement and ownership of agricultural products throughout
    the supply chain, ensuring transparency and accountability. Some examples include:


    * **Supply Chain Traceability:** Tracking the provenance and journey of the product,
    ensuring authenticity and reducing fraud.

    * **Organic Farming:** Natural cultivation of crops and animal rearing using biological
    materials, with blockchain providing traceability and verification of organic
    practices.

    * **Smart Agriculture:** Using modern Information and Communication Technologies
    (ICT) to manage farms and enhance product quality and quantity. Blockchain integrates
    with IoT sensors and monitors environmental factors, crop health, and livestock
    data.


    **Incentivization mechanisms** in blockchain applications for rural development
    aim to encourage specific behaviors or actions by providing rewards or incentives.
    Examples include:


    * **Incentivization of Sustainable Practices:** Rewarding farmers for adopting
    environmentally friendly practices, such as reducing water usage or using sustainable
    energy sources.

    * **Waste Management Incentive:** Providing incentives for responsible waste disposal
    and recycling, promoting cleanliness and environmental protection in rural areas.

    * **Healthcare Incentives:** Encouraging individuals to share medical data for
    research and diagnosis, with privacy preserved and fair compensation provided.

    * **Educational Incentives:** Rewarding students for academic achievements, course
    completion, or participation in educational programs, using blockchain to securely
    store and verify educational credentials.


    **Other applications** of blockchain technology in rural development include:


    * **Energy:** Facilitating energy access in remote areas, promoting sustainable
    energy solutions, and enabling peer-to-peer energy trading.

    * **Environment:** Monitoring and managing natural resources, such as water and
    soil, to promote environmental sustainability and conservation.

    * **Employment:** Creating employment opportunities in rural areas, connecting
    job seekers with potential employers, and enhancing skills development through
    blockchain-based platforms.

    * **Healthcare:** Improving access to healthcare services in rural areas, providing
    telehealth solutions, and facilitating the distribution of medical supplies and
    vaccines.

    * **Education:** Enhancing educational opportunities in rural areas through e-learning
    platforms, digital libraries, and blockchain-based educational certification systems.

    * **Financial Inclusion:** Providing access to financial services, such as mobile
    banking, microfinance, and insurance, for financially underserved populations
    in rural areas.

    * **Governance:** Promoting transparency, accountability, and citizen participation
    in local governance processes, using blockchain to securely record and manage
    government data and transactions.


    Overall, blockchain has the potential to address significant challenges and enhance
    economic, social, and environmental aspects of rural development, empowering rural
    communities and contributing to sustainable growth and prosperity.'

    Abstract\nAccording to the United Nations, Sustainable Development Goals are framed\
    \ for improving rural health, hunger, poverty \nissues, environmental conditions,\
    \ and illiteracy globally. With the upcoming technology, there have been many\
    \ advances \nin the lifestyle of people all around the world. Comparatively, more\
    \ emphasis has been given to the development of urban \nareas than rural. The\
    \ sustainable development of a country depends on the growth of its rural areas.\
    \ Countless technologi-\ncal and theoretical models, projects, and frameworks\
    \ have been proposed and implemented to help overcome sundry issues \nand challenges\
    \ faced by rural people in quotidian life. New technological methods are deemed\
    \ to be the future of livability, \ntherefore; a technologically advanced solution\
    \ for sustainable rural development is called for. Blockchain Technology is the\
    \ \nnext step for innovation and development and it has far many applications\
    \ in sustainable rural development that are yet to \nbe discovered. The objective\
    \ of this paper is to explicitly review research conducted in rural development\
    \ to fill the undone \nwork in the future with better research ideas, to make\
    \ rural areas a livable and advanced place while also maintaining their \nintegrity\
    \ leading to sustainable development. To conduct such a review, a systematic research\
    \ methodology is applied follow-\ning regulations in the conduction of standardized\
    \ but explorative analysis. Within the timeline of 2010–2021, 112 papers are \n\
    carefully selected to perform the systematic review. This review will provide\

    \ of a country partly depends on how well \nconnected are its rural areas to the\
    \ global chain and how \ntechnologically advanced they are. Rural areas as we\
    \ know \nof are geographical locations sited outside town or cities \nwith fewer\
    \ populations. Essentially, we also know it as a \nplace unprivileged of vital\
    \ necessities, stricken by poverty \n[1], and unemployment. For many years, rural\
    \ areas have \nbeen developing consecutively in Technology, Education, \nHousing,\
    \ Governance, Human rights. Accordingly, the \nworld’s rural population has dropped\
    \ from 66.389 percent \nin 1960–44.286 [2] percent in 2019 due to various trans-\n\
    formations. Years ago, people in rural areas were deprived \nof necessities such\
    \ as water, electricity, and education. \nEven getting a reliable source of electricity\
    \ was a strenuous \neffort. Moreover, female rights, reliable healthcare and sub-\n\
    sequently securing a job were more of a dream. According \nto the United Nations,\
    \ there can be seen a steady drop in \nthe percentage of people residing in rural\
    \ areas from 1960 \nto 2019 [3]. What was the core reason behind it? A general\
    \ \nexample of the reason can be migration, rural decline, demo-\ngraphic qualities,\
    \ natural disasters, and infrastructure: trans-\nportation or socio-economic.\
    \ These can further be exploited \ninto many explanations as to what leads to\
    \ those choices. \nRural–Urban migration itself directs catastrophic changes \n\
    in the environment and economy. Rural Decline is another \nconsequence of migration\
    \ that drains the area of services, \nbusinesses, and social capital forcing the\
    \ development of the \nFig. 1  Issues in rural areas\n2419\nA Systematic Literature\

    \ or probably diminish [4]. Even then, almost \nhalf of the world’s population\
    \ comes under rural areas and it \nconsists of many more issues than resolvable.\n\
    1.1  Background\nThis section explores the interdependent backdrops of the \n\
    rural area and a feasible solution through the concept of \nsmart villages. Sustainable\
    \ development goals with respect \nto Blockchain Technology are discussed in sub-Sect. 1.1.2\
    \ \nand a brief introduction on Blockchain Technology and \ndevelopment techniques\
    \ are mentioned in sub-Sect. 1.1.3.\n1.1.1  Rural Development\nSustainable Development\
    \ Goals (SDGs) were framed for \nimproving rural health, hunger, poverty issues,\
    \ environ-\nmental conditions, and illiteracy globally. The present situ-\nation\
    \ of rural areas brings us to a list of issues (Fig. 1) that \ncan further promote\
    \ the eradication of rural areas from the \nglobal chain if not technologically.\
    \ Beginning with pov-\nerty which has been an issue unresolved regardless of the\
    \ \nvarious monetary schemes provided by the government \ndrives the young generation\
    \ out of the community to find \njobs to sustain daily needs. Many of them fail\
    \ to finish \neven high school, which leads to securing menial jobs in \nurban\
    \ regions. This brings us to the second issue in the \nrural community, illiteracy\
    \ [5]. Education that plays a vital \nrole in the overall development of humans,\
    \ as well as the \ncommunity, is often disregarded to fulfill contemporary \n\
    requirements such as money. In many cases, the parents \nexploit their children\
    \ into working on the farm or small \nfamily businesses.\nTypical issues in a\
    \ rural school can be enumerated as \nteacher’s absenteeism, unhygienic school\
    \ premises, and dis-\ntant schools, technologically backward, absence of school\
    \ \nrecords, inexperienced teachers, and teachers with false \ndegrees. Those\
    \ who get themselves educated, consider it \nbetter to get a job in urban areas\
    \ because of job opportunities \nand better pay which is at times difficult since\
    \ most villages \nlack communication between employees and job availability \n\
    [6]. Basic hygiene and pollution are other issues in rural \nareas that deplete\
    \ life expectancy and give birth to numer-\nous diseases. Many rural communities\
    \ do not have proper \nsanitation facilities, dumping grounds, or recycling plants.\
    \ \nNot having the basic facilities drives people into a lack of \npersonal hygiene\
    \ such as bathing, washing, and cleanliness \n[7]. Pollution of land and soil\
    \ is prevalent due to unhealthy \nsanitary practices. Hundreds of people still\
    \ live without \nwashing their hands leading to diarrhea, cholera, and the \n\
    death of children [8]. Acknowledging the fact that medical \npractitioners, physicians\
    \ are scarce on top of that reaching \na nearby multispecialty hospital takes\
    \ a lot of time [9]. The \nprimary activity of rural people is said to be agriculture.\
    \ \nIt is considered to be the basic source of income for the \ndwellers. Farmers\
    \ in many areas remain uninformed about \nthe recent advancements in agro-technologies.\
    \ The core \nreason for this incomprehension is the lack of broadband \nconnection\
    \ and incentives. Even though the Government \nprovides various monetary as well\
    \ as agricultural schemes, \nmore than half of the farmers fail to enroll in one\
    \ [10]. In \naddition to that from the consumer’s point, there is a whole \nheap\
    \ of issues relating to the certification of quality produce, \nimproper monitoring\
    \ of crops, traceability of farm produce, \nand unsustainable agro-activities.\
    \ Besides, the involvement \nof middlemen leaves the farmers with the minimal\
    \ price \nof agricultural produce [11]. Further, given the aspects of \ndaily\
    \ needs, approximately 940 million [12] people around \nthe world live without\
    \ access to electricity, most of which \nbelong to rural areas. In a generation\
    \ where electricity is \nthe basic need in every household, industry, medical\
    \ center \nwithout which the whole institution of Earth would come \nto a halt,\
    \ there are still people who do their daily activi-\nties without it [8, 9]. About\
    \ 1.7 billion [13] people in the \nworld are still unbanked. The banking facility\
    \ is essential \nfor financial assistance especially much needed to financially\
    \ \nexcluded dwellers of the rural community. However, due \nto unreachable banking\
    \ locations, time-consuming Banking \nprocesses, and in many cases lacking identity\
    \ proof con-\nstrains the adults from applying for a bank account further \nreducing\
    \ the chances of obtaining a loan or funding from \ngovernment schemes [14].\n\
    The concept of a smart village [15] is to develop a rural \narea using technology\
    \ as a medium. The biggest problems \nin rural areas are financial exclusion,\
    \ poverty, hygiene, and \neducation [16]. All the issues are interconnected and\
    \ co-\ndependent, such as due to poverty, children in rural areas fail \nto get\
    \ an education [17]. Due to illiteracy, the villagers do \nnot come to know about\
    \ various financial schemes. People \nseem to care very less about hygiene. Not\
    \ only the waste \nis disposed of incorrectly, but it is also burnt giving rise\
    \ to \nenvironmental pollution. Most of the time people do not \nfind encouragement\
    \ to learn how to properly discard waste \nmaterial, to get educated, or find\
    \ a solution to their financial \nproblems [18].\n1.1.2  Sustainable Development\
    \ and Blockchain\nThe development of an economically backward area without \n\
    jeopardizing the natural assets or future necessities is termed \nsustainable\
    \ development. According to the United Nations, \nSustainable Development Goals\
    \ (SDG) [19] were adopted \nin 2015 for improving rural health, hunger, poverty\
    \ issues, \nenvironmental conditions, and illiteracy globally (Fig. 2). \nThe\
    \ sustainable development goals that balance the socio-\neconomic and environmental\
    \ factors are:\n2420\n \nP. Kaur, A. Parashar \n1 3\nFor rural development, World\

    \ and many other support activities \nalong with social protection and transportation\
    \ programs \nfor rural communities [2]. IFAD projects for eliminating \npoverty\

    \ smart vil-\nlage is an approach to empowering underserved communi-\nties, providing\
    \ the power, education, entrepreneur oppor-\ntunities. Following are the project\
    \ initiatives by IEEE \nSmart Village Initiative: Mural Net(MNAZ)- Broadband \n\

    \ consumers in eastern Uttar Pradesh, \nIndia [21].\nChallenges of achieving Sustainable\
    \ Development Goals \n(SG’s) in rural areas can be elucidated in terms of different\
    \ \nregions. As per the research [22], in Ukraine, control over \nthe large businesses\
    \ and their impact over the agribusiness \nstructures in addition to shrinking\
    \ the number of farms, \njeopardizing rural population, poverty, and fewer efforts\
    \ in \nsocial cohesion improvements or remote development are \nthe principal\
    \ challenges of achieving SDG.\nSimilarly, as per the methodology applied by the\
    \ author in \n[23], the major challenges faced by Romania over achieving \nSDG\
    \ are the Socio economic discrepancy among the rural \ndwellers’ lives as well\
    \ as the Environmental incongruity.\nA few of the Sustainable Development challenges\
    \ faced \nby the Iranian Rural communities as per the authors [24] \nare economic\
    \ setbacks, improper management, and under-\nplanned developments, environmental\
    \ factors, social con-\ncerns, and infrastructural challenges were determined.\
    \ \nOverall implications of the studies provide us with a con-\ncise picture of\
    \ significant challenges of achieving sustainable \ndevelopment goals in rural\
    \ areas.\nSustainability and blockchain both are the call for the \nfuture to\
    \ reduce cost, increase productivity, improving \nhealth, better environmental\
    \ state, and availability of food, \nwater, and sanitation. Blockchain holds the\
    \ ability for long-\nterm and inclusive progress in sustainable development and\
    \ \nto achieve SDGs.\n1.1.3  Blockchain Technology\nIn 2008 when Satoshi Nakamoto\
    \ [25] (pseudonym) proposed \nBitcoin, its expansion was doubted. The rise of\
    \ Blockchain \nwas such unforeseen that some enthusiasts asserted it as the \n\
    biggest invention since the Internet [26]. Although W Scott \nStornetta and Stuart\
    \ Haber described the first cryptographi-\ncally secured chain of blocks in 1991,\
    \ it wasn’t until 2009 \nthat Blockchain was implemented as the public ledger\
    \ for \nbitcoin transactions by Nakamoto. For a substantial amount \nof time,\
    \ Blockchain technology was only preferred for a \ncryptocurrency (Fig. 3). However,\
    \ after the introduction of \nscripting language into the blocks by Ethereum Blockchain\
    \ \nto work as bonds, which are now known as Smart Contracts \nthe inventory of\
    \ applications widely opened. In his paper \nNakamoto proposed to create a peer-to-peer\
    \ form of elec-\ntronic cash that did not require a financial institution as an\
    \ \nintermediary and would be transferred directly between \none party and another.\
    \ He improved the double-spending \nFig. 2  Sustainable development \ngoals\n\

    \ \n1 3\nproblem in Digital Signatures by implementing timestamps \non the transaction\
    \ and hashing them onto the ongoing chain \nof hash-based proof-of-work which\
    \ changed the proof-of-\nwork if tampered with hence forming an immutable record.\n\
    Blockchain, even though it uses pseudonyms as account \nidentifiers, has four\
    \ key trust characteristics that eliminate \nthe need for third-party authenticators.\
    \ Firstly, a ledger in \nwhich after successful verification and authentication\
    \ the \ntransaction details are stored. Secondly, it is Secure since \nits transactions\
    \ are time-stamped and hashed to the previ-\nous blocks; it makes the blockchain\
    \ cryptographically secure \n(Fig. 4). Thirdly, the shared characteristic of involving\
    \ mul-\ntiple users provides transparency amongst all participants \nin the distributed\
    \ ledger. Lastly, its property of being dis-\ntributed eliminates operational\
    \ inefficiencies, provides more \nsecurity as the more the number of nodes the\
    \ more resilient \nit is towards attacks [27].\nThe complexity of the working\
    \ of blockchain can be \nsimplified by exploring the components that make up its\
    \ \narchitecture [28]. The main components can be enumer-\nated as Node, Cryptographic\
    \ hash functions, Transactions, \nAsymmetric-key cryptography, Ledgers, Blocks,\
    \ Miners, \nand Consensus (Fig. 5).\nNode: A device possibly a computer forming\
    \ the structure \nof a blockchain. A node is where the blockchain exists. Cop-\n\
    ies, as well as original records of the blockchain, are stored \nin a node. Classified\
    \ as Full node and Light nodes, where \nFull node is a server in a decentralized\
    \ network that contains \nthe Block chain’s block history, and Light nodes are\
    \ used for \nsimple payment verification such as a wallet that queries the \n\
    current status of a block.\nLedgers: A decentralized blockchain uses a ledger\
    \ for \nrecord-keeping. As it is decentralized, it keeps many copies \nof the\
    \ transaction including providing a copy to each user \nof their transaction.\n\
    Blocks: A block resembles a page in a record book \n(ledger). The first block\
    \ is called the generic block. A block \ncomprises a block header and block data\
    \ where the block \nheader consists of the history of the blockchain (previous\
    \ \nhash value, timestamp, size of the block, and nonce) and \nminers perform\
    \ hashing to validate the block, and block data \nkeeps the record of recent transactions\
    \ that are yet to enter \nthe blocks.\nCryptographic hash functions: A digest\
    \ or an algorithm \nthat takes up an arbitrary amount of data and produces a \n\
    hash value or hash which is an output of fixed size. It elimi-\nnates the use\
    \ of a password, instead uses enciphered text that \nprovides more security from\
    \ attackers.\nTransactions: A transaction is what the components work \nabout.\
    \ When two parties interact in blockchain, a transaction \ntakes place. Authorization\
    \ is required to approve a transac-\ntion between two parties. In a public blockchain,\
    \ the trans-\naction is inserted by consensus which happens when the \nmajority\
    \ of nodes validate the transaction.\nAsymmetric-key cryptography: It is public-key\
    \ cryptogra-\nphy that is used to enable certitude between the transacting \n\
    parties who are unsure about each other’s integrity. Asym-\nmetric-key cryptography\
    \ uses mathematically related keys to \nensure safety as well as the secrecy of\
    \ data. The public key \nand Private key, even though relative is used for decryption\
    \ \nand encryption, respectively.\nMiners: When two users create a transaction,\
    \ the miners \nvalidate that transaction in the block data before putting it \n\
    on the ledger. The average time it takes for a miner to mine a \nblock is 10 min.\
    \ Since miners use their energy and hardware \nto solve a block, they also require\
    \ an incentive for their work \nwhich is mostly paid in cryptocurrency.\nConsensus:\
    \ A consensus can be identified as a decision-\nmaking criterion. It makes sure\
    \ that all the nodes validate a \nblock and no such duplicity exists in the ledger\
    \ that hasn’t \nbeen agreed upon. The discussion involved in consensus is \nFig.\

    1 3\nused to solve identity-issue, clarify altercations, and estab-\nlish a similar\
    \ viewpoint between the participants by applying \na set of rules.\nEthereum:\
    \ introduced by Vitalik Buterin [29] addressed \nvarious limitations of the scripting\
    \ language in the block-\nchain. The platform is used to build and publish distributed\
    \ \napplications by using a programming language. It is said \nto be an improvement\
    \ over the blockchain structure. It pro-\nvides data-friendly services to all\
    \ and sundry no matter their \nlocation or background. Ethereum consists of full\
    \ nodes that \nrun the Ethereum Virtual machine to deploy distributed pro-\ngrams\
    \ such as smart contracts. Application development in \nblockchain can be done\
    \ through Ethereum which can also \ncall multiple other blockchain, protocols,\
    \ and cryptocurren-\ncies [30]. Ethereum uses the chain of global computers to\
    \ \noperate and runs smart contracts that are free of intermediar-\nies or third-party\
    \ censorships. Ethereum uses an incentive \nmechanism [31] to encourage programmers\
    \ who run the \nFig. 4  Blockchain technology diagram\n2423\nA Systematic Literature\

    \ to compensate for hardware and energy \nused in running decentralized digital\
    \ applications (dapps). \nThese incentives are called Ether which is a cryptocurrency\
    \ \nin the Ethereum protocol.\n1.1.4  Blockchain Development Platforms and Tools\n\
    To simplify the blockchain processes and to ease the devel-\nopment various tools\
    \ and programming languages have been \nintroduced.\n1.1.4.1 Ethereum Virtual\
    \ Machine (EVM) The executing \ncode and the Executing machine consist of an abstraction\
    \ \nwhich is referred to as virtual machines, and Ethereum vir-\ntual machines\
    \ increase the intended code execution chances, \nand the consensus is maintained\
    \ on it [32].\n1.1.4.2 Remix IDE Remix Integrated Development Envi-\nronment is\
    \ open-source software for web or desktop devel-\nopment. An intuitive and appealing\
    \ interface remix allows \nsmart contract development and Ethereum interaction\
    \ [33]. \nRemix IDE has multiple plugin options such as Web3 inte-\ngration, embedded\
    \ Web3, and Javascript for running the \ncontract locally. Solidity smart contract\
    \ programming lan-\nguage is used for development in Remix IDE.\n1.1.4.3 Smart\
    \ Contracts Simple programs stored on the \nblockchain comprise some predefined\
    \ conditions [34]. \nUpon meeting the conditions the contract is self-executed\
    \ \ngiving the edge of non-intermediary processes as well as \ntime efficiency.\
    \ Multiple programming languages are used \nto develop smart contracts for blockchain;\
    \ a few of them \nhave been discussed below:\n• Solidity [35]: A highly preferred\
    \ object-oriented design-\nbased, high-level language conveniently made for \n\
    developing smart contracts. Most of the solidity syntax \ninspiration came from\
    \ C ++ , Javascript, and Python pro-\ngramming languages. Solidity, along with\
    \ being the top \nsmart contract language focusing on EVM in certain also \nsupports\
    \ inheritance and user-defined types.\n• Vyper [36]: Highly influenced by python\
    \ and the sec-\nond-best after Solidity, vyper is based on three important \n\
    principles namely auditability to ensure the readability \nand understandability\
    \ of the code for the user, Security \nto ensure secure smart contracts, and Simplicity\
    \ of the \nlanguage and the implementation.\n• Yul [37]: An intermediate smart\
    \ contract development \nlanguage that includes the bytecode compilation accord-\n\
    ing to different backend needs. The main focuses of Yul \nare simplicity in bytecode\
    \ translation, understandability, \nand readability of the scripted programs.\
    \ Yul supports \nstack machines and is specifically tailored for them, \nwhole-program\
    \ optimization, and static type reference \nand value nature.\n1.1.4.4 Hyperledger\
    \ A Linux framework for blockchain \ndevelopment that provides standards and tools\
    \ for open-\nsource blockchain applications [38]. Hyperledger enterprise \nhelps\
    \ build permissioned blockchain solutions for busi-\nnesses and services. Under\
    \ the Hyperledger Framework, \nmultiple projects have been introduced:\n• Hyperledger\
    \ Fabric: A modular permissioned and private \nframework for blockchain technology\
    \ used for develop-\ning solutions for businesses and private enterprises. Fab-\n\
    ric has a well updated smart contract interaction, faster \ntransactions, and\
    \ efficient data sharing.\n• Hyperledger Explorer: Explorer is a user-friendly\
    \ block-\nchain development web application tool. The interface \nprovides detailed\
    \ information about the blocks, trans-\nactions, network nodes, and the state\
    \ of the blocks. \nHyperledger Explorer uses visualization tools for repre-\n\
    senting the blockchain data in a user-friendly and read-\nable manner.\n• Hyperledger\
    \ Sawtooth: By separating the core system, \nthat is, specifying the business\
    \ rules without interact-\ning with the application domain is the main task of\
    \ \nhyperledger sawtooth. It supports the Practical Byzantine \nFault Tolerance\
    \ (PBFT) as well as the Proof of Elapsed \nTime (POET). The smart contracts can\

    Limitations of Blockchain are limited but cannot be disre-\ngarded [39]. From\
    \ the creation of the node to the validation \nby miners, Blockchain consumes\
    \ a lot of energy. Splitting of \nthe chain is another problem where a node does\
    \ not accept \nthe transactions in a new chain if it is operating to the old \n\
    software. The computing requirements increase as the block-\nchain grows. Since\
    \ all the nodes cannot provide the neces-\nsary capacity, the node breaks, and\
    \ the immutability and \ntransparency of the blockchain cease to exist.\n1.1.5\
    \  Blockchain for Smart Village Applications\nThe scenario in a typical village\
    \ is such, in terms of the \ninfrastructure most of it is inadequately built,\
    \ there exists \nschools and colleges but poorly maintained, poorly built \nhouses\
    \ with no constraints for disaster management. In \nterms of necessities, normal\
    \ villages lack stable electricity \nsupplies, or a secure income to support electricity\
    \ bills, and \nnon-purified water. People in villages are often neglected \nand\
    \ most of the dwellers don’t have any personal or national \nidentity. The healthcare\
    \ system in villages is simple and inef-\nficient which does not help during major\
    \ problems. Normal \nvillages lack any technological advancement and people \n\
    there live in history because of the lacking development. \nSustainable development\
    \ with the concept of smart villages \ncan give a secure and feasible future to\
    \ the villages.\nBeyond the conventional use of blockchain in finance \nusing\
    \ cryptocurrency, numerous applications can change the \nway we perceive digitization.\
    \ According to Kandaswamy \n[40], blockchain can have four types of initiatives:\
    \ block-\nchain disruptor, digital asset, efficiency play, and record-\nkeeper\
    \ (Fig. 6). With similar inventiveness some of the \nblockchain applications with\
    \ the concept of a smart village \ncan be enumerated as:\nHealthcare: Blockchain\
    \ with its record-keeping charac-\nteristics and smart contract with its privacy\
    \ and security has \ngreatly assisted the medical area by providing a solution\
    \ \nfor publicly or semi-private sharing of the medical data of \npatients. This\
    \ can help the researchers and students to elicit \na new solution or use it for\
    \ clinical trials [41]. The solution \nfor missing health documents or previous\
    \ clinic visit records \ncan be improved through blockchain. The potential of\
    \ Block-\nchain to store patient’s record on the ledger make it possible \nto\
    \ get treatment across the globe. Furthermore, the problem \nof counterfeit drugs\
    \ in the market can be resolved through \nthe traceability solution from blockchain\
    \ through which fake \nmedicines can be traced and removed from the supply chain.\n\
    International payments and insurance: Accelerated pay-\nment to international\
    \ locations is possible through block-\nchain technology. Several Bitcoin-operated\
    \ services make it \neasier to transfer money cross-border. The process includes\
    \ \nconverting the payer’s local currency into Bitcoin bypass-\ning the existing\
    \ banking infrastructure and then converting \nthat Bitcoin into the receiver’s\
    \ local currency. This saves the \ntrade cost and speeds up the transaction. Apart\
    \ from that, \nthe insurance industry can also be benefitted from block-\nchain\
    \ technology [42]. Blockchain can provide a transparent \nand trustworthy system\
    \ to overcome the challenges of the \ninsurance industry. Fraudulent claims, intermediary\
    \ payment \ntransactions, and big data handling are some of the many \nissues\
    \ faced by insurance companies. Blockchain can resolve \nthe issues through its\
    \ security and transparency provided by \nthe distributed ledger which also furnishes\
    \ the authentic-\nity of the participants. Besides, its characteristic of record-\n\
    keeping comes in handy with the huge amount of customer \ndata that is immutable\
    \ in the blockchain ledger. Additionally, \nby using the smart contracts real-time\
    \ data of the claims, \nreimbursements or payments can be fetched from multiple\
    \ \nsystems in no time.\nPersonal Identity Record-keeping: Identity is an integral\
    \ \npart of society that provides a unique character and sense \nof acceptability\
    \ in a country. However, physical forms of \nnational identity are not accessible\
    \ to many people around \nthe world. The absence of identity makes it difficult\
    \ for \npeople to participate in voting, banking, employment and \nlimits the\
    \ chances of access to the financial system. Here \nblockchain steps in by providing\
    \ identity solutions through \nFig. 6  Blockchain elements\n2425\nA Systematic\
    \ Literature Review of Blockchain Technology for Smart Villages \n1 3\ndigital\
    \ identity. Additionally, self-sovereign identity arranges \noptions to store\
    \ one's identity on devices accessible across \nthe world [43].\nSupply chain\
    \ and logistics: Blockchain can bring great \nusability to supply chain management.\
    \ Procurement, trace-\nability, digital payments, and logistics are some areas\
    \ that \nhave benefitted from blockchain technology. The distributed \nledger\
    \ can reduce the sharing of operational data by provid-\ning a full view of the\
    \ sale/purchase data, accessible from \nany device. Fraud in the food supply chain\
    \ is prevalent in \nmany countries. Counterfeit products selling in the market\
    \ \nprove hazardous to the consumer. The Block chain’s QR \ntracking system along\
    \ with digitized physical products can \nbe used to track products from production\
    \ to delivery [44]. \nThis technology has started benefiting the agricultural\
    \ sec-\ntor to develop food safety and smart farming increasing the \nincome of\
    \ small farms and food producers.\nEducation: Keeping physical records and transcripts\
    \ can \nbe a hassle. This blockchain provides a solution for digitiz-\ning student\
    \ records, transcripts, and payment receipts [45]. \nDigital record-keeping can\
    \ benefit a student as it will be \nacceptable by universities across the globe,\
    \ free of manipula-\ntion, and handy. Blockchain can also be used to incentivize\
    \ \nstudents through a course credit system. The credit can be \ntranslated to\
    \ cryptocurrency, which can be further used as \nfee payment.\nBlockchain with\
    \ the Internet of Things (IoT): Powerful \nunion of two futuristic technologies\
    \ makes machine-to-\nmachine transactions easier. The decentralized authority\
    \ \nof blockchain combined with the smart devices run by IoT \nallows a function\
    \ to autonomously execute without a central \nauthority [46]. Smart IoT run devices\
    \ can be implemented \non edge devices, reducing data transfer costs, and security\
    \ \nissues with the blockchain collaboration [47]. Blockchain \nintegration with\
    \ IoT can highly change the agricultural sec-\ntor. Supply chain traceability\
    \ could benefit the farmers in \neliminating the intermediaries through traceability\
    \ and RFID \ntag-based applications. Water, soil, climate, and other sen-\nsory-type\
    \ IoT devices can help in monitoring the agricultural \nactivities and gathering\
    \ the farm data and activities such as \ncultivation and livestock data in the\
    \ blockchain ledger. IoT \nwith blockchain will certainly revolutionize and transform\
    \ \nmany rural and urban sectors.\n1.2  Motivation and Major Contributions\nSustainable\
    \ Rural development starts with the participation \nof rural people in improving\
    \ their lifestyle. Without the peo-\nple working for their development, any implementation\
    \ or \nhelp is incomplete. Economic and technological sector links \nare important\
    \ for rural areas to develop. Along with that, a \nhealthy agricultural sector\
    \ improves the dweller’s linkage to \nthe global supply sector. By managing the\
    \ social, economic, \nenvironmental, and health objectives the development can\
    \ be \nfast-forwarded. There is a considerable amount of potential \nin rural\
    \ people which can be applied to employment issues, \nsocial disparities, E-governance,\
    \ women's rights etcetera. \nDeveloping rural areas can benefit nationally, economically,\
    \ \nand financially. This systematic literature review aims to pro-\nvide extensive\
    \ literature related to blockchain’s application \nin rural development and sustainable\
    \ living. A plethora of \nblockchain review papers available does not provide\
    \ a col-\nlective literature review of blockchain applications divided \ninto\
    \ different areas directed towards rural and sustainable \ndevelopment. Therefore,\
    \ clear and concise information can \nbe gained about blockchain’s work in improving\
    \ rural devel-\nopment providing scope for future research in this direction.\
    \ \nThe primary contributions are mentioned below:\n• A systematic review of relevant\
    \ literature for research \ntrends, key applications, and areas of implementing\
    \ \nBlockchain Technology for smart villages for sustain-\nable rural development.\n\
    • Identification of major issues in rural development and \nhow they can be addressed\
    \ using Blockchain Technology.\n• Exploration of the existing software, platforms,\
    \ and tools \nfor the implementation of Blockchain in Rural Develop-\nment.\n\

    \ Review on Blockchain \nTechnology for Sustainable Rural \nDevelopment\nThe literature\
    \ review consists of the collective work of \nblockchain in rural development.\
    \ A total of 6 areas of \napplication were identified after careful extraction\
    \ of data \nand transformation globally namely: Agriculture, Bank-\ning, Environment,\
    \ Energy, Employment, and Healthcare. A \ndetailed discussion on the related work\
    \ is discussed in the \nsubsections.\n4.1  Agriculture\nIn the agriculture sector,\
    \ most of the application areas \nincluded supply chain traceability, facilitation\
    \ of smart agri-\nculture, and incentivization of services (Fig. 14). A detailed\
    \ \nsummary is given in Tables 5, 6, and 7.\n4.1.1  Supply Chain Traceability\n\
    The author F. Tian, [51] studied the integration of RFID \n(Radio-frequency Identification)\
    \ and blockchain technology \nin building the agri-food supply chain traceability\
    \ system. \nWith the help of blockchain technology, the information \nshared and\
    \ traceability is guaranteed. Apart from the sup-\nply chain, it also regulates\
    \ food safety and quality supervi-\nsion. This system can enhance the credibility\
    \ and reliabil-\nity of agri-food safety information. With the depletion of \n\
    an application cost, this system can effectively change the \ncurrent supply chain\
    \ to be more quality-enhanced and safe. \nSimilarly, Hua et al. proposed an agriculture\
    \ [65] provenance \nsystem based on blockchain featured by decentralization, \n\
    collective maintenance, consensus trust, and reliable data \nto solve the trust\
    \ crisis in the product supply chain. The \nsystem’s Target is to record information\
    \ related to the pro-\nduction supply chain: production, processing, storage,\
    \ trans-\nportation, and distribution of agricultural products. It also \nfacilitates\
    \ Recordkeeping from basic planting information \nto provenance records. The proposed\
    \ work solved the issue \nof the credibility of data and the difficulty of integrating\
    \ the \nsubsystem of each company.\nThe paper by Casado-Vara et al., [58] addressed\
    \ the issues \nof the current supply chain such as communication gaps \nbetween\
    \ vendors or the opacity of the origin of the product. \nThe author has proposed\
    \ a new model of the supply chain \nvia blockchain where all the members of the\
    \ supply chain \nsave all their transactions in the blockchain to ensure higher\
    \ \nsecurity. This model also enables a circular economy that \nis a make-use-recycle\
    \ model. With this model, all products \ncan be traced from their origin to their\
    \ sale and subsequent \nrecycling.\nFurther, Caro et al., [70] presented AgriBlockIoT\
    \ which \nis a fully decentralized blockchain-based traceability solu-\ntion for\
    \ agricultural food supply chain management. The \nproposed architecture based\
    \ on API includes a controller to \nconvert high-level function calls to corresponding\
    \ for the \nblockchain layer and blockchain itself which is the main \nFig. 10\

    blockchain can create transparent, fault-tolerant, immuta-\nble, and auditable\
    \ agri-food traceability records. The authors \nLi and Wang, [85] characterized\
    \ the research applications \nof blockchain in food supply traceability. With\
    \ the help of \nblockchain technology and various radiofrequency devices \ncan\
    \ be integrated to collect data from farms, deploy sensors, \nand create intelligent\
    \ contracts to implement server logic. \nThe new system can change the traditional\
    \ food supply sys-\ntem by making it more convenient, efficient, and trustable.\
    \ \nKim et al., [54] presented a theoretical, end-to-end, vis a vie \n“farm-to-fork”,\
    \ food traceability application named Harvest \nNetwork with the integration of\
    \ Blockchain technology and \nInternet-of-things. The process includes tracing\
    \ the prod-\nucts from processing, grading, transportation, temperature, \nand\
    \ contractual payment all with blockchain, IoT, and smart \ncontracts. This can\
    \ help consumers gain field-level insight \ninto the products. Lin et al., [63]\
    \ proposed an IoT and block-\nchain integrated self-organized, open, and ecological\

    \ which provides transparency, efficiency, secu-\nrity, and safety to the food\
    \ produce. According to Kamble \net al., [55], the supply chain practitioners\
    \ found a lack of \nefficiency and transparency which leads to constant threats\
    \ \nto formers and consumers. The system deployed the ISM \nmethodology to identify\
    \ Blockchain technology enablers \nin the agriculture supply chain. The findings\
    \ implied the \nacceptance of blockchain technology as an innovative tool to \n\
    ensure an efficient agriculture supply chain by the practition-\ners. To achieve\
    \ further traceability the farmers could cap-\nture relevant information about\
    \ the agricultural events onto \nthe blockchain to enable transparent and trusting\
    \ sources of \ninformation for the farmers. Kamilaris et al., [60] explored \n\
    how the food supply chain and agriculture were impacted \nby blockchain technology.\
    \ The stages of the supply chain \nwith blockchain technology has been identified\
    \ as (1) the \nprovider (2) producer, (3) processing, (4) distribution, (5) \n\
    retailer, and (6) consumer where a web application or device \ncan be used to\
    \ scan the item’s QR code to view its detailed \ninformation. Along with this,\
    \ the author explored various \nchallenges and benefits of the agricultural supply\
    \ chain \nand Blockchain’s collaboration. Salah et al., [66] proposed \na solution\
    \ of eliminating the third parties and centralized \nauthorities in the food supply\
    \ chain along with a security \nsystem for food traceability, transparent records,\
    \ and gov-\nernance of interactions and transactions between the users. \nThe\
    \ model entities are related to providing secure tracking \nof the product and\
    \ payment with Ethereum smart contracts. \nThus, the presented model for traceability\
    \ can be used to \ntrace and track the soybean supply chain. S. Missineo, [75]\
    \ \nproposed a model to secure storage origin provenance for \nfood data. The\
    \ proposed system aims to certify the produc-\ntion and the supply chain concerning\
    \ food local products \nby using Blockchain Technology and Smart Contracts. The\
    \ \nauthor aimed to ensure the authenticity of typical Sardinian \nproducts and\
    \ to sell them online or offline. The platform \nensured the consumer to check\
    \ the authenticity of the prod-\nuct before the purchase giving details on both\
    \ the production \nchain and supply chain. Jaiswal et al., [86] proposed mul-\n\
    tiple smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum blockchain \nfor decentralized\
    \ trading of food grains. The framework \nincluded Peer-to-peer trading, the security\
    \ of food grain \ndata, transparency, user anonymity, trust, and incentives as\
    \ \nkey features. The design of the framework consisted of four \ncontracts namely\
    \ food grain supply, bidding, trading, and \nutilization for the supply chain\
    \ management. Dong et al., \n[56] proposed a collaborative model of blockchain\
    \ and IoT \nin the agriculture sector. The data collection and transmis-\nsion\
    \ can be distinguished through a unique identity card \ngiven to each agricultural\
    \ product. All the environmental \naspects of the agricultural process can be\
    \ gathered at the \nsource. Along with that crop growth information, circulation\
    \ \nof the product using an RFID tag and distribution process \ncan also be recorded\
    \ and stored on the distributed ledger. \nA QR code attached to the product can\
    \ be scanned by the \nconsumer to view product information in details.\nFig. 14\

    \ \n1 3\nWithal, Madumidha et al., [145] proposed the use of \nblockchain technology\
    \ to maintain tamper-proof records, \navoid intermediaries and provide security\
    \ to the transac-\ntions which in turn reduces transaction costs and improves\
    \ \nthe quality of the products. The food products are labeled \nwith RFID tags\
    \ to maintain the supply chain. The author \nexplained the revolutionary changes\
    \ blockchain technology \ncan bring to the supply chains and how it can increase\
    \ the \neconomic conditions of a country by reducing corruption \nrates and increasing\
    \ the satisfaction of producers and con-\nsumers. Paul et al., [83] proposed a\
    \ way to eliminate inter-\nmediaries between farmers and consumers to provide\
    \ the \nright amount for the farm produce. The proposed system \nconsists of blockchain\
    \ nodes namely Supply companies, \nlandowners, markets, and farmers. The farmer\
    \ node sets the \namount after the agreement period, the market node collects\
    \ \nand stores crops and stops intermediaries from manipulating \nthe prices,\
    \ the landlord node collects the money from the \nland on lease, and the supply\
    \ company node sells extra agri-\ncultural products to the farmers. This platform\
    \ named KHET \nwhere all the nodes are interconnected through Ethereum \nblockchain\
    \ is beneficial for farmers, landlords, and markets.\nMusah et al., [62] main\
    \ objective in proposing the role of \nblockchain in Ghana’s cocoa beans food\
    \ supply chain was \nto evaluate the contributions made by applications of block-\n\
    chain technology in the supply chain. The system provides \na global traceability\
    \ platform, supply chain intelligence and \nvisibility, Africa cocoa village;\
    \ impact the investing for \nsmallholder farmer and uses Bean tracker. The author\
    \ care-\nfully studied the tools and platforms benefiting the cocoa \nbean production\
    \ and supply chain processes.\nAdditionally, Baralla et al., [146] proposed a\
    \ blockchain-\nbased generic agri-food supply chain traceability system \nfor\
    \ implementing the farm-to-fork model. In this system, \na QR code scan can allow\
    \ the consumer to reconstruct the \nproduct history to verify product health and\
    \ quality. The \nmain contribution of this article was the authentication and\
    \ \nverification of shared data’s integrity in supply chain man-\nagement. With\
    \ the help of this system, the involved operators \ncould identify any new participants\
    \ along with the supply \nchain which increased the degree of trust between organiza-\n\
    tions and individuals. Dakshayini et al., [87] proposed an \nintegrated model\
    \ based on Blockchain, big data, and cloud \nto efficiently manage crops that\
    \ achieve effective demand-\nbased decision support, simplified, transparent,\
    \ and secure \nagricultural supply chain. The proposed model has a higher \npercentile\
    \ of achieving demand and supply of crops which \navoids the farmer’s loss, catering\
    \ to consumer’s needs, pro-\nvides sustainable agricultural practices, reducing\
    \ middlemen \ninvolvement, and reducing price inflation problems. Saji \net al.,\

    \ Villages \n1 3\nnew markets. The system improved farming profitability \nand\
    \ endorsed the financial stability of cultivators. It also \nprovided health benefits,\
    \ reduced food wastage, eliminated \nmanipulation, and adulteration, and supports\
    \ the supply \nchain of agro-products. Saurabh and Dey, [69] identified the \n\
    potential divers of blockchain concerning the grape wine \nsupply chain. The smart\
    \ contract-based module was con-\nstructed to ensure trust between participants\
    \ during trans-\nactions. The proposed model enhanced the customization, \ncompetitiveness,\
    \ and usability of the supply chain.\nIqbal and Butt, [84] proposed a model to\
    \ save the farm-\ner’s crops from animals at night. A repelling and notifying\
    \ \nsystem (RNS) is installed in the field that receives signals \nduring an animal\
    \ attack. Human-safe ultrasonic waves are \nproduced by this RNS which drives\
    \ the animals away. This \nproposal also consists of a farm management system\
    \ that \nreceives the report regarding the hazards caused in the fields. \nThis\
    \ system enabled timely data delivery, efficient multi-hop \ncommunication, dependable\
    \ data transmission, and low-cost \ntechnology. Chun-Ting et al., [73] proposed\
    \ a blockchain-\nbased agricultural traceability service platform for tamper-\n\
    proof data storing and backup. The system design consists of \nData collecting\
    \ layer where IoT sensors collect environmen-\ntal data, the blockchain layer\
    \ takes data from the formal layer \nand sends them to blockchain nodes and later\
    \ to blocks, and \nthe application layer handles the requests to access transac-\n\
    tion data based on the transaction hash. Hegde et al., [81] \npresented different\
    \ ways of implementing blockchain with \nthe agricultural supply chain. With the\
    \ use of blockchain, the \nproducers can get data and income security, and keep\
    \ track \nof environmental changes that affect the crops. The trace-\nability\
    \ option provides clarity in any damage that occurred \nto the product and an\
    \ overall increase in efficiency can be \nachieved by producing only required\
    \ products hence reduc-\ning wastage. Peña et al., [89] presented a systematic\
    \ review \non blockchain in food supply chain management in Ecua-\ndor. According\
    \ to the review, most of the work was done in \nHyperledger composer, models for\
    \ business interactions and \nhuman interactions, Traceability, Security, and\
    \ Blockchain \nInformation.\nAdditionally, M. Kumarathunga, [57] after reviewing\
    \ \npresented the way to reduce transaction costs and improve \nfarmer’s involvement\
    \ in agricultural supply chains. To \nreduce transaction costs farmers can participate\
    \ in Infor-\nmation sharing, goal congruence, decision synchronization, \nincentive\
    \ alignment, resource sharing, collaborative commu-\nnication, joint knowledge\
    \ creation. Xu et al., [80] reviewed \nthe working principle of blockchain technology\
    \ in the agri-\nfood sector. Blockchain technology provided data transpar-\nency,\
    \ data traceability, food safety, and quality monitoring, \nand agriculture finance.\
    \ Additionally, food safety and qual-\nity can be secured by digitizing products.\
    \ According to the \nreview, blockchain revealed a better approach to the future\
    \ \nof the agri-food supply chain which is safer, healthier, sus-\ntainable, and\
    \ reliable. Mirabelli and Solina, [71] collected \nand analyzed the applications\
    \ of blockchain technology and \nits contribution to agricultural food traceability\
    \ issues. The \nreview showed that the usability of blockchain technol-\nogy in\
    \ the agricultural sector was still in the early stage. \nThe review highlighted\
    \ three main aspects namely starting \nproblem, area of interest, and contribution.\
    \ Blockchain can \nbe a valid way to minimize fraud and errors in agricultural\
    \ \nsupply chains by increasing the quality and safety of food \nproducts. Shahid\
    \ et al., [53] have proposed a complete solu-\ntion to the blockchain-based agricultural\
    \ and food supply \nchain. The paper aimed to provide an end-to-end solution \n\
    to the growing blockchain-based agri-food supply chains. \nFurther, it achieved\
    \ the following properties: accountability, \ncredibility, auditability, autonomy,\
    \ and authenticity. The sys-\ntem also acted as a better alternative to the existing\
    \ supply \nchain system by enabling a scalable and auditable system. \nAwan et al.,\
    \ [79] proposed a smart agricultural model as a \ntransformation to the traditional\
    \ agricultural supply chain. \nThe system consists of Seed seller, Farmer, Crop\
    \ buyer, \nProcessor, Crop storage, Distributor, Retailer, Customer. \nTo improve\
    \ the food supply chain’s productivity and reli-\nability the smart model was\
    \ proposed. The model allowed \nfarmers to enter and monitor the data in the plant.\
    \ The main \nobjective of this model was to provide equal opportunities to \n\
    the participants of the agricultural food supply chain. The-\njaswini and Ranjitha,\
    \ [64] proposed a model that explores \nthe problems faced by people in agriculture\
    \ production and \nits solutions based on blockchain technology. Blockchain \n\
    solutions for traceability of crops, disclosure of data, clarity \nin food production,\
    \ and authentic agricultural products was \nproposed by the author. This proposed\
    \ model ensured food \nsafety, benefitted farmers, and stakeholders.\nYadav et al.,\
    \ [67] reviewed the blockchain adoption bar-\nriers in the Indian agricultural\
    \ supply chain. The barriers \ncan be enumerated as Lack of proper government\
    \ regulation \nand regularity uncertainty, Huge resource, and initial capital\
    \ \nrequirement, security and privacy concerns, lack of interop-\nerability and\
    \ standardization, etc. Further, the barriers were \nmodeled using an integrated\
    \ ISM-DEMATEL approach \nwhich provided limited interpretative logic. W. Lin,\
    \ [59] \nprovided a survey to study the techniques and applications \nof blockchain\
    \ technology. The application categories of \nblockchain in agriculture are Provenance\
    \ traceability and \nfood authentication, smart farming data management, trade\
    \ \nfinance in the supply chain management, and other informa-\ntion management\
    \ systems. The paper also indicated possible \nfuture developments and applications\
    \ of blockchain. Dutta \net al., [61] reviewed articles related to blockchain\
    \ technol-\nogy’s integration with various supply chain operations. The \nbenefits\
    \ of Blockchain in supply chains can be enumer-\nated as Data management, Improvement\
    \ in transparency, \n2444\n \nP. Kaur, A. Parashar \n1 3\nImprovement in response\
    \ time smart contract management, \nOperational efficiency, and Disintermediation,\

    \ the main supply chain functions were identified \nas supply chain provenance,\
    \ supply chain resilience, supply \nchain re-engineering, security enhancement,\
    \ business pro-\ncess management, and product management. The work also \nexamined\
    \ various challenges and impacts of blockchain in \nthe supply chain. Shahid et al.,\
    \ [77] proposed a solution for \na blockchain-based reputation system in the agriculture\
    \ and \nfood supply chain. The system model consisted of invoking \nsmart contracts\
    \ to provide reviews based on the services to \nthe providers. The reviews are\
    \ requested by buyers and the \nsellers’ review the transactions and perform other\
    \ transac-\ntions based on that. The system was proposed to maintain \nthe immutability\
    \ and integrity of the registered review. \nTorky and Hassanein, [82] presented\
    \ a comprehensive sur-\nvey on IoT and blockchain and their importance in devel-\n\
    oping smart applications. According to the review, crops \noverseeing, livestock\
    \ grazing, and food supply chain are a \nfew subsectors in precision agriculture\
    \ managed by block-\nchain platforms. Apart from that, a novel blockchain model\
    \ \nwas also proposed to use as an important solution for major \nchallenges in\
    \ IoT-based precision agricultural systems. The \nobjectives of Skender and Zaninović,\
    \ [74] in their paper \nwere to analyze blockchain technology’s overall perspec-\n\
    tive, investigate its potential in a sustainable supply chain \nto replace the\
    \ shortcomings in the traditional supply chain. \nThe traceability and transparency\
    \ in the agricultural supply \nchain can be improved with blockchain.\nTo better\
    \ understand the benefits and challenges and the \nperspective for sustainable\
    \ blockchain, the author provided \na conceptual framework. Borah et al., [68]\
    \ proposed a novel \nblockchain-based Farmer and Rely called FARMAR. The \nsystem\
    \ could provide fair prices and reduce duping by mid-\ndlemen. The assets can\
    \ be traced from farmers to consumers, \nreducing the artificial inflation of\
    \ prices. Ferrag et al., (2020) \n[76] reviewed the research challenges on IoT-based\
    \ agricul-\nture and its security and privacy issues. The rest of the paper \n\
    identified threat models against green IoT-based agriculture \nanalyzed the privacy-oriented\
    \ blockchain-based solutions \nand consensus algorithms for green IoT-based agriculture.\
    \ \nEnescu and Ionescu, [52] proposed a model for farmers in \nthe agri-food sector\
    \ using blockchain. This system ensures a \ncredible supply chain for producers\
    \ and consumers, guaran-\nteed timely payments between the participants. The authors\
    \ \nproposed this system to provide transparency, security, and \ntrust in the\
    \ trading process. Chaudhari et al., [90] proposed \na framework for a secure\
    \ and transparent supply chain with \nthe help of blockchain technology. With\
    \ the help of this sys-\ntem, the farmers can get a fair price for their products.\
    \ This \ntransparent and tamper-proof supply chain system generates \na bill at\
    \ the end including the commissioning price as well as \nthe total price after\
    \ sold product hence benefiting the farm-\ners in knowing the selling and market\
    \ price. Xie et al., [91] \nproposed to construct a traceability framework For\
    \ fresh \nE-commerce agricultural product quality and safety based \non blockchain\
    \ technology. To access the key control points \nthe author used the FMECA (failure\
    \ model effect and key \nanalysis) to analyze the failure mode, impact, and hazards\
    \ \nin the traceability chain. This system can promote agricul-\ntural development\
    \ through decentralization, consensus trust, \nmaintenance, and reliable database\
    \ features.\nFurthermore, Li et al., [92] proposed a blockchain-based \nTraceability\
    \ of the fresh food supply chain With the help of \nbusiness process reengineering\
    \ (BPR). The overall traceabil-\nity architecture is based on key links’ product\
    \ quality data \nand participants’ transactions. The objective of this trace-\n\
    ability system was to ensure data integrity. Flores et al., [93] \nproposed a\
    \ model for decentralization of data and provide \ntraceability of agricultural\
    \ products with blockchain tech-\nnology. Using this method could guarantee transparency\
    \ of \nthe supply chain and other operations as well as the transac-\ntions involved.\
    \ Fernandez et al., [94] proposed a Blockchain-\nbased model to improve farmer’s\
    \ profits. The author aimed \nto improve the output primitives of the supply chain.\
    \ Farmer-\nto-consumer product tracking and cost were the main factors \nin improving\
    \ traceability in the supply chain. Cortez-Zaga \net al., [95] proposed a model\
    \ used in the Peruvian agricul-\ntural sector using blockchain. When using blockchain\
    \ it can \neliminate dependence on a central entity, provides integrity \nof the\
    \ process, transactions become irrevocable, secure, \nand private, and provides\
    \ transparency and immutability. \nG. Zhao, [96] presented a systematic literature\
    \ review that \nexplored the advances in the agri-food supply chain. The \npaper\
    \ also pointed out the challenge of the applications of \nblockchain technology\
    \ enumerated as storage capacity and \nscalability, privacy leakage, high-cost\
    \ problem, regulation \nproblem, throughput and latency issues, and lack of skills.\n\
    Land record maintenance using blockchain was also \nproposed by Bhorshetti et al.,\
    \ for easy maintenance of land \nrecords in real-time. The database proved to\
    \ be a non-failure \nsystem and the work provided intermediary-less land title\
    \ \ntransfer and processing between owners. This system pro-\nvided security,\
    \ transparency, and a broker-free land man-\nagement system [97]. The paper by\
    \ Thakur et al. presented \nthe issues related to land records maintenance, registration,\
    \ \nsettlements, and banks. The system ensured better land man-\nagement, lesser\
    \ fraudulent transactions while strengthening \nthe sustainable development goals\
    \ (SDG) and increasing the \nGDP of the country [98].\n4.1.2  Agriculture Security\
    \ System\nTse et al., [102] proposed food supply information security \nbased\
    \ on blockchain technology. The use of blockchain in \n2445\nA Systematic Literature\
    \ Review of Blockchain Technology for Smart Villages \n1 3\nthis system can regain\
    \ the people’s trust in the food mar-\nket, the government can collect statistics\
    \ on various kinds \nof food, and adulterated and fake food in the market can\
    \ \nbe eliminated. This type of technology can benefit the cus-\ntomer, manufacturers,\
    \ and supervision departments of the \nfood supply chain. Wu and Tsai, [103] proposed\
    \ an intel-\nligent agriculture network security system by applying dark \nweb\
    \ technology to monitor packet transmission frequency in \norder to prevent DDOS\
    \ attacks. The system applied a dark-\nnet mechanism to identify anyone who attempts\
    \ to access \nblockchain data. It also incorporated IoT sensors to gather \ndata\
    \ regarding temperature, humidity, and soil. This model \nwas proposed to keep\
    \ track of the farms and cultivation fac-\ntors related to an environment and\
    \ to establish network secu-\nrity for IoT networks.\n4.1.3  Organic Farming\n\
    Reddy and Kumar, [101] presented the article based on the \nsustainability of\
    \ the food supply chain. The author's objec-\ntive was to achieve Fair Trading\
    \ and a circular economy with \nthe help of blockchain technology. With this framework,\
    \ the \nfollowing results but achieved: Automatic hashing for less \nelectricity\
    \ consumption, product malfunctioning and add \nalteration, the involvement of\
    \ middlemen, availability of \nfarming jobs, and facilitating development and\
    \ unity among \nfarmers. According to Basnayake and Rajapakse, [104], the \npurpose\
    \ of the research was to implement a Blockchain-\nbased solution to verify food\
    \ quality. The process included \nFarmers issuing a product contract to control\
    \ the quality of \neach product. For each deployment of the product contract,\
    \ \nit would return an address that was used to generate the QR \ncode to identify\
    \ the physical product. Lastly, Consumers \nwere also eligible to rate the product\
    \ quality to ensure trust.\n4.1.4  Smart Agriculture\nTo overcome remote monitoring\
    \ challenges and provide \nsecurity and privacy in agriculture, Patil et al.,\
    \ [105] pro-\nposed a lightweight architecture for smart greenhouse farm-\ning.\
    \ The model consisted of four groups showing the integra-\ntion of blockchain\
    \ with IoT namely (1) smart greenhouse, (2) \noverlay network, (3) Cloud storage,\
    \ and (4) End-user. This \nmodel can be used to successfully monitor the secure\
    \ trans-\nmission of greenhouse data. Umamaheshwari et al., [106] \nproposed a\
    \ model for Buying and selling crops and land. \nThe model used Ethers as a cryptocurrency.\
    \ According to \nthe paper, the recordkeeping of crops grown in the land was \n\
    useful to know the history of plantations in the land. With \nthe help of this\
    \ model, users were able to access real-time \ndata about crops, eliminate the\
    \ need for middlemen, and \nestablish a transparent and efficient system. Voutos\
    \ et al., \n[107] proposed the integration of IoT and smart contracts \nto develop\
    \ smart agriculture to deliver higher quality agri-\ncultural products. It also\
    \ focuses on improving the associ-\nated supply chain and logistics benefiting\
    \ the participants \ninvolved. The author discussed the factors of smart agri-\n\
    culture as soil factors, climate, sensors, research, supply \nchain, storage,\
    \ analytics, and smart contracts. Miloudi et al., \n[100] proposed IoT, Blockchain,\
    \ and Geospatial technology-\nbased Smart farming to manage the farming practices\
    \ more \nsmartly and sustainably. The system proposed smart farming \nmanagement\
    \ in 4 stages namely (1) Integrated blockchain \nwith IoT platform where various\
    \ IoT sensors apply analytics \nand sends data to the blockchain, (2) Blockchain\
    \ Working \nMethodology where data visibility is provided through smart \ncontracts,\
    \ (3) Integrating GIS with blockchain where the \ndata sent from IoT sensors are\
    \ improvised and accuracy is \nfacilitated through GIS geospatial tools, and (4)\
    \ certifying \nfarmers in blockchain stage facilitates authorities and privi-\n\
    leges to the farmers through smart contracts which could \ngreatly benefit farmers\
    \ and food production industry.\nFurthermore, Devi Et al., [108] Proposed a design\
    \ archi-\ntecture by merging IoT and BC for smart agriculture. The \nnodes involved\
    \ in the blockchain received the information \nfrom the sensors that were connected\
    \ to the things involved \nin the Smart Agriculture monitoring process. The design\
    \ \narchitecture enhanced the security and data transparency \nperformance of\
    \ smart agriculture. Vangala et al., [109] \nreviewed blockchain technology and\
    \ its information security \nschemes. The application areas covered by the authors\
    \ were \nagriculture monitoring, controlled agriculture/smart green-\nhouses,\
    \ food supply chain tracking, and precision farming/\nsmart farming. The review\
    \ also presented a thorough analy-\nsis of the security attributes, application\
    \ areas, advantages, \ndrawbacks, and competing schemes’ cost of computation \n\
    and communication. Branco et al., [110] proposed a con-\nceptual approach with\
    \ the integration of IoT and blockchain \nfor a mushroom farm distribution process\
    \ control system. \nThe proposed system allowed the collection of distributed\
    \ \ndata on the environmental factors contributing to mushroom \nproduction providing\
    \ collection, storage, and processing of \nmushroom farm data to be scalable,\
    \ immutable, transparent, \nauditable, and secure.\n4.1.5  Dairy Farming\nMisra\
    \ and Das, [111] presented a conceptual framework \nusing blockchain to bring\
    \ feasibility and efficiency in \nE-governance. The architecture consisted of\
    \ a service-\noriented architecture framework to store details of stake-\nholders\
    \ involved in user services on demand, a blockchain \narchitecture that would\
    \ allow stakeholders to authenticate \nand perform transactions on the ledger,\
    \ and digital identity \narchitecture to act as a regulator in the architecture.\
    \ With \na dairy farmer as a user or participant in the architecture \n2446\n\
    \ \nP. Kaur, A. Parashar \n1 3\nwho would benefit from the transactions while\
    \ having vot-\ning rights and leadership entities in the system the author \n\
    conceptually explored the prototype of the dairy coopera-\ntive sector in India.\
    \ Similarly, Rambim and Awuor, [112] \nproposed a model for dairy farmers in Kenya\
    \ that explores \nthe potential use of blockchain technology in milk delivery\
    \ \nin rural areas. From the Naitiri Dairy farmers’ cooperative \n(NADAFA) in\
    \ Kenya, the author introduced a Milk Deliv-\nery Blockchain Manager (MDBM) which\
    \ is a decentralized \nplatform to automatically capture the quantity and quality\
    \ \nof milk delivered by the farmers. The delivery data stored \nin the blockchain\
    \ is immutable, cryptographically hashed, \nand digitally signed. The details\
    \ of delivery are accessible \nto the farmers. The NADAFA facilitates the system\
    \ and pro-\nvides payment to the dairy farmers on time. The consortium-\nbased\
    \ network provides leveraging blockchain solutions for \nfarmers.\n4.1.6  Livestock\n\
    Under Livestock monitoring, Alonso et al., [113] worked on \nimportant trends\
    \ in the applications of IoT and edge comput-\ning paradigms in the smart farming\
    \ field. This helps produc-\ners to optimize processes, provides the origin of\
    \ the product, \nand guarantees the quality to its consumers. The state of \n\
    dairy cattle and feed grain can be monitored in real-time by \nusing artificial\
    \ intelligence and blockchain technology. This \nis to ensure the traceability\
    \ and sustainability of different \nprocesses of farming. The implementation of\
    \ smart farm-\ning contributed to the reduction of data traffic and reliable \n\
    communications between IoT-Edge layers and the Cloud. \nAccording to Hang et al.,\
    \ [114], the uncertain data qual-\nity of analysts’ data can be solved through\
    \ blockchain. The \nproposed structure brings scalability, off-chain storage,\
    \ pri-\nvacy, and high throughput as advancement to the previous \nversion. Various\
    \ IoT data is fetched from fish farms such \nas temperature, water level, oxygen,\
    \ and PH data. The data \nstorage can be a database or cloud and end-user can\
    \ view \nthe fish farm’s detailed information through smart devices. \nLeme et al.,\
    \ [147] proposed a novel infrastructure based on \nthe integration of cloud storage\
    \ and blockchain technology \nto monitor the overall health of livestock. The\
    \ components \nof the architecture can be named as (1) Administrator, (2) \nUsers,\
    \ (3) Cloud service, and (4) blockchain network. With \nthe help of RFID tags\
    \ attached to the cattle, various entities \ncan be monitored to ensure that cattle\
    \ go through necessary \nprocedures. Yang et al., [115] proposed a novel method\
    \ to \nensure traceability and authenticity in the livestock supply \nchain using\
    \ blockchain. The model uses RFID-sensor-based \nlivestock monitoring in the food\
    \ industry where the sen-\nsors augment the physical tracking and solved the RFID’s\
    \ \ninherent computational capacity limitation by using cloud \nservices. The\
    \ data is then made accessible to the end con-\nsumer through Block chain’s transparent\
    \ ledger.\n4.1.7  E‑Agriculture\nThe analysis proposed by Li et al., [116] Investigated\
    \ the \nconvenience of sustainable electronic agriculture based on \nBlockchain\
    \ technology and analyzed the application likeli-\nhood and challenges of Blockchain\
    \ in the agricultural field. \nThe authors selected 5 villages with similar development\
    \ \nrates in china and Blockchain technology was applied using \ndata statistics\
    \ to the sustainable e-agriculture for exploring \nits convenience. Results showed\
    \ that sustainable electronic \nagriculture based on Blockchain Technology brought\
    \ great \nconvenience to the farmer’s sales, increasing by 25% on \naverage compared\
    \ with traditional electronic agriculture. \nSong et al. [117], to improve the\
    \ biased point of view, higher \ninitial costs, and lack of transparency and trust\
    \ proposed a \nsystem for providing sustainability in the current agri-food \n\
    supply chain. The paper discussed blockchain adoption in \nrural areas and relative\
    \ energy consumption from supply and \ndemand perspectives.\n4.1.8  Agriculture\
    \ Monitoring\nArshad et al., [99] proposed a private blockchain-based \nsecure\
    \ access control for agriculture to monitor climatic \nparameters. Private Blockchain\
    \ access control (PBAC) was \nused to guarantee secure communications where a\
    \ user usu-\nally goes through initialization, authentication, and revo-\ncation.\
    \ The farms monitoring system consists of the login \nphase, system setup phase,\
    \ user/farm professional registra-\ntion phase, password authentication and session\
    \ key agree-\nment phase, update or change phase, and addition of node \nphase.\
    \ The whole system stores access records and lessen \nthe computational and communication\
    \ overhead. Forbye, \nN. Bore, [118] proposed a model to improve the shortcom-\n\
    ings of existing digitized farming models through the AG-\nWallet System (AGWS).\
    \ The AGWS design consisted of (1) \ndigitizing the far demand–supply, (2) The\
    \ farm information \npipeline was to ensure secure storage and validate events\
    \ \nreceived from IoT, and (3) data analytic services that make \nthe information\
    \ visible to the participants. The system pro-\nposed by Osmanoglu et al., [119]\
    \ uses a blockchain-based \nyield estimation solution. Farmers can share the farming\
    \ \nplans for the upcoming harvesting season with other par-\nticipants, or learn\
    \ from other’s plans to review their plans. \nSmart contracts can be employed\
    \ by participants to share \ntheir yield commitments. The author improvised a\
    \ censor-\nship-resistant, tamper-proof, and immutable public ledger of \ntime-stamped\
    \ transactions.\n2447\nA Systematic Literature Review of Blockchain Technology\
    \ for Smart Villages \n1 3\n4.1.9  Farmers\nTalreja et al., (2020) [121] proposed\
    \ a farmer’s portal with \nthe help of blockchain technology and python to preserve\
    \ the \ncontract of trade between farmers and consumers. The farm-\ner’s portal\
    \ is a way to access farm activities. The proposed \nwork enhanced the degree\
    \ of participation, reduced inter-\nmediary cost, simplified process, provided\
    \ ease of selling \ncrops, and greater efficiency. The immutability of blockchain\
    \ \ntechnology fortified farmers for getting a fair price for their \ncrops and\
    \ reduced operational costs. Abraham and Kumar, \n[120] proposed a blockchain-based\
    \ data security system to \npreserve farmer’s data. The proposed work was based\
    \ on a \nprivate-permissioned blockchain for controlled participation, \nhyper\
    \ ledger fabric to support smart contracts, and system \ndesign to safely store\
    \ farm data. The widened blockchain \ndata helps farmer’s data to be accessed\
    \ by other participants \nwhich can allow the government to sanction schemes based\
    \ \non farmer’s data. Topart et al., [122] proposed an interoper-\nable ecosystem\
    \ of farmer’s consent management. The model \nused a permissioned blockchain to\
    \ allow only a specific \ngroup of people to access the services. The immutability\
    \ of \nconsent allows the data to be non-manipulative, distributed, \nsigned transactions,\
    \ and transparent. The consent verifica-\ntion for each data allows only valid\
    \ users to request data. \nThe model was proposed to respect the privacy, security,\
    \ \ntransparency, and consent of the farmer’s data.\n4.1.10  Incentivization\n\
    Blockchain has been using incentive mechanisms since bit-\ncoin to incentivize\
    \ miners, but recently many authors have \npresented ways of promoting work for\
    \ a reward. Incentives \nto promote sustainable agricultural practices by Giaffreda\
    \ \net al., [123]. Objectives include savings and increasing \nmarket value plus\
    \ monitoring the use of water in the fields. \nFarmers have been relying on satellite\
    \ data as it is a cheap \nsource of agricultural services. With the use of LPWAN\
    \ net-\nworks, accuracy in fields is increased along with a tensiom-\neter-a sensing\
    \ unit that is used to wirelessly communicate \nthe data related to the humidity\
    \ of the soil and a mini-meteo \nstation that is used to measure temperature,\
    \ air humidity, and \nair pressure. Smart contracts record the transactions from\
    \ the \ncalculated results in the cloud and release the incentives to \nthe farmer\
    \ according to their deal with the stakeholder. The \nproposal includes EnvCoins\
    \ as the incentives, which can be \nfurther used to buy technologies for sustainable\
    \ agricultural \npractices, for cash, or investment. Esmaeilian et al., [124]\
    \ \nproposed an incentive mechanism for green behavior such \nas waste disposal,\
    \ using re-furbished products, purchasing \nenergy-efficient products, saving\
    \ energy, recover, repair, \nand maintain. The tokens gained from sustainable\
    \ behav-\nior can be further used to access services on blockchain. \nIncentivization\
    \ can ameliorate some of the environmental \nissues in rural areas with the help\
    \ of rural people by moti-\nvating them to clean the areas. OpenLitterMap by S.\
    \ Lynch, \n[125] uses geospatial analysis to geotag various types of \nlitter.\
    \ It uses LitterCoins as an incentive mechanism for the \nproof of work. This\
    \ is to motivate people to submit correct \ndata. It also rewards for uploading\
    \ litter images from a new \nlocation. Apart from plastic and other homogenous\
    \ litter, a \nproposal to eliminate solid waste from small municipalities \nin\
    \ return for a reward is given by França et al., [148]. The \nprovision was to\
    \ change the original system from attack risk, \ndata loss, power outage, and\
    \ other such problems. The new \ndigitized system proves to be a handier as it\
    \ is in the form of \na mobile application. The reward for selling solid waste\
    \ to \nthe collecting agent is in Green Coins, a cryptocurrency sent \nto the\
    \ seller’s virtual wallet. This initiative led to comput-\nerization gains, information\
    \ integrity, and the use of crypto-\ncurrency. Additionally, in [128] D. Zhang,\
    \ worked on a simi-\nlar solution to efficiently use rural waste in incentivizing\
    \ \nrural people. The process includes the installation of smart \nbins and when\
    \ they are full, the collection trucks will swap \nthe waste for a digital coupon\
    \ which the farmer can use to \neither get agricultural products from the waste\
    \ to the energy \nplant or cash them. Blockchain makes it an easier process to\
    \ \ntransfer and record data faster with maximum transparency. \nOther applications\
    \ of incentives for waste include Recereum, \nSwachhCoin, Plastic Bank, 4New,\
    \ and OILSC [129].\nThe motivational incentive mechanism can also transform \n\
    the way medical data is shared for research and diagnosis. In \nthe paper by Zhu\
    \ et al., [126], the authors gave a solution to \nactuate people into sharing\
    \ medical data by providing them \nrewards for doing so. The rewards system is\
    \ based on the \naccess provided by the owner of the medical file. Through \n\
    Smart contracts, a trusted payment money flow can be \ndevised between the third\
    \ party and the owner. The Shapley \nvalue was considered for the revenue distribution\
    \ of medi-\ncal data sharing and to study the impact of consensus on \nthe miner’s\
    \ income. Furthermore, an incentive mechanism \nfor the accident alert system,\
    \ proposed by Devi and Pamila, \n[127] is another blockchain-based medical application.\
    \ \nAccording to the authors, most of the accidents occurs near \nrural places\
    \ where medical help is unreachable on time. To \neliminate the privacy issue\
    \ of the nearby user who receives \nthe accident report, a blockchain-based incentive\
    \ method \nis implemented for the user who receives the accident alert \nto send\
    \ the location of the victim to a close-by emergency \nservice. Then the message\
    \ initiator gets rewarded incen-\ntives for alerting about the accident. A similar\
    \ report system \nmobile application for anonymous reporting is proposed by \n\
    Zou et al., [130] in which reporting any incident can earn \npeople rewards. The\
    \ design goal of the author was to imple-\nment an anonymous report system, to\
    \ provide privacy to the \nperson who reports, without having to give their personal\
    \ \n2448\n \nP. Kaur, A. Parashar \n1 3\ninformation to the system. This model\
    \ induces incentive \nnamed Rcoins to whoever published the report information,\
    \ \nthe repliers, and the consenting miners. The Blockchain and \nKudos by Sharples\
    \ and Dominigue, [131], a reward-based \npermanent solution as the digital record-keeping\
    \ model. The \nauthor proposed the use of blockchain to store digital certifi-\n\
    cates, achievements, and credits. Stored as a public record \nit can be accessed\
    \ by the institutions or the student online. \nThe model uses Kudos an educational\
    \ reputation currency \nas a reward. The reward can be earned through uploading\
    \ \ncertificates on the blockchain, passing a test, or on course \ncompletion.\
    \ Another application of blockchain-based incen-\ntive system is EduCTX by Turkanović\
    \ et al., [132] which \nis proposed to globally enable the higher education credit\
    \ \nplatform. For potential stakeholders such as educational \ninstitutions, companies,\
    \ and organizations a unified view \nof student’s higher education credits and\
    \ grading system \nis placed on the global ledger through blockchain. ECTX \n\
    tokens will be credited based on the completion of courses \nwhich will act as\
    \ proof of completed courses.\n4.2  Environment\nIn the environment sector, the\
    \ most emphasis was given \non blockchain applications in Natural hazards, Water,\
    \ and \nWaste management in rural areas (Fig. 15). A detailed sum-\nmary is given\
    \ in Table 8.\n4.2.1  Waste Management\nFrom the articles proposed, in D. Zhang,\
    \ [128] the author \nworked on a similar solution to efficiently use rural waste\
    \ \nin incentivizing rural people. This framework is based on \nChina’s Yitong\
    \ system which is waste to energy plant for \nagricultural waste and the use of\
    \ blockchain to provide digi-\ntal coupons or cryptocurrency in return for waste.\
    \ The author \nproposed the use of a web application to use a QR code \nscanner\
    \ when the waste is collected from a smart bin, also \nencouraging segregation\
    \ of agricultural waste and residential \nwaste. The serves receive the weight\
    \ of waste, lodges it on \nthe global ledger, and the coupon is rewarded based\
    \ on the \nweight. Apart from plastic and other homogenous litter, a \nproposal\
    \ to eliminate solid waste from small municipali-\nties in return for a reward\
    \ is given by França et al., [148]. \nThe provision was to change the original\
    \ system from attack \nrisk, data loss, power outage, and other such problems.\
    \ The \nnew digitized system proves to be a handier as it is in the \nform of\
    \ a mobile application. The reward for selling solid \nwaste to the collecting\
    \ agent is in Green Coins, a cryptocur-\nrency sent to the seller’s virtual wallet.\
    \ This initiative led to \ncomputerization gains, information integrity, and the\
    \ use of \ncrypto-currency.\nLatif et al., [133] have addressed the smart waste\
    \ manage-\nment system with the integration of IoT and blockchain. The \nproposed\
    \ model included identification of waste material, \ntrace location, send to trash,\
    \ categorize waste, transfer waste, \nrecycling, and decision-making process.\
    \ The sensor nodes \nin the model were used for waste identification, and adding\
    \ \nnew blocks and the admin and waste management offices \nwere responsible for\
    \ collecting, executing recycling, and \ndelivering products. The recyclable wastes\
    \ are transformed \ninto useful products and share with the customers and send\
    \ \nthe non-recyclable wastes to the trash.\nFig.15  Blockchain applications \n\

    \ smart contracts execute the claims to the farm-\ners. Deployment of the system\
    \ can ensure water supply in \nrural areas and accessibility of insurance in case\
    \ of droughts \nor floods.\n4.2.3  Water Management\nThe intelligent smart watering\
    \ system proposed by Munir \net al., [135] is a blockchain-based system for the\
    \ smart \nconsumption of water. The system uses IoT for capturing \nreal-time\
    \ environment conditions such as soil moisture \nlevel, light intensity, air humidity,\
    \ and air temperature. The \nmain focus of the proposed system was to develop\
    \ a healthy \necosystem while efficiently using water in plantations and \ngardening.\
    \ Forbye, A water control system to efficiently \nmanage and coordinate the use\
    \ of water in irrigation com-\nmunities is proposed by Bordel et al., [136]. The\
    \ prosumer \nenvironment in the model is composed of a rule definition \nmodule\
    \ where users can create irrigation recipes using ECA \n(Event-Condition-Action)\
    \ rules. These rules are executable \nand easily transformed into other programming\
    \ languages. \nInputs are taken by a transformation engine, to create, com-\n\
    pile, and deploy a set of Smart Contracts coding all the irri-\ngation and management\
    \ logic. Finally, irrigation recipes are \nexecuted by an execution engine, which\
    \ invokes deployed \nSmart Contracts to interact with the infrastructure. From\
    \ \nthe perspective of Dogo et al., [137] proposed convergence \nof IoT and Blockchain.\
    \ Objectives of smart water solutions \ninclude smart measuring and monitoring\
    \ across the water \ndistribution, enhanced security, better analysis of the gener-\n\
    ated data, and enhanced revenue and efficiency.\nSimilarly, Hassija et al., [138]\
    \ proposed a drone-mounted \nbase station in the tactile internet environment\
    \ based on \nblockchain. The drone-mounted small cell station was based \non a\
    \ Permissioned peer-to-peer blockchain. To take strategic \ndecisions, a game\
    \ theory model was deployed. The deci-\nsion was based on user association; transmit\
    \ power level, \ndrone speed, and altitude. Additionally, smart contracts can\
    \ \nadd parameters and conditions based on requirements. The \nmodel’s results\
    \ showed that the low network areas can expe-\nrience better bandwidth with the\
    \ proposed system.\nFurther, the proposed model by Pincheira et al., [139] pre-\n\
    sented a trustless water management system-based software \narchitecture. The\
    \ system proposed presented a decentralized \nwater management system that could\
    \ incentivize virtuous \nbehavior in agricultural practices. Smart contracts were\
    \ used \nfor their intermediary-less characteristic. The authors also \nimplemented\
    \ a cross-platform software library to allow con-\nstrained devices to interact\
    \ with blockchain directly. The \nFig. 16  Blockchain applications \nin Smart\

    Enescu et al., [140] proposed a study on the use of photovol-\ntaic energy. The\
    \ paper showed the use of photovoltaic panels \nto power a power plant for the\
    \ improvement of abandoned \nland. According to the authors, photovoltaic panels\
    \ can eas-\nily pump water and is a more appropriate use of solar energy. \nBlockchain\
    \ can help reduce the intermediary distributors \nhence making the selling and\
    \ buying of energy more profit-\nable. Additionally, Kulkarni and Kulkarni, [141],\
    \ consider-\ning the lack of electricity in rural India, proposed a model to \n\
    solve rural electrification problems. The model introduces \npeer-to-peer energy\
    \ trading through blockchain suitable for \nsmall and remote micro-grids. A reliable\
    \ and profitable elec-\ntricity supply can be obtained through micro-grids. Smart\
    \ \ncontract-based meters allow transparency in the daily usage \nof energy used\

    4.4  Banking\nIn the banking sector, most of the solutions were about \nissues\
    \ in banking availability in rural areas, loan sanctions \nto under-documented\
    \ people, and methods of transferring \nmoney (Fig. 17). A detailed summary is\
    \ given in Table 10.\n4.4.1  Loan\nGuo et al., [151] proposed a novel poverty\
    \ alleviation loan \nmanagement called the Loan On Blockchain (LoC). In the \n\
    LoC, the participating roles can be named as the Financial \ndepartment to check\
    \ the identity and application informa-\ntion of the participants, bank to provide\
    \ loan to the cus-\ntomer, Customer to provide identity and apply for loan, civil\
    \ \naffairs department to audit the customer identity and loan \napplications,\
    \ Regulator to monitor fund flow and inspect \nledger. This digital account model\
    \ was proposed for decen-\ntralized and centralized transfer of assets. Similarly,\
    \ Jain \net al., [152] presented a solution named Bit-score for credit \nscoring\
    \ for underprivileged (rural) people with the help of \nblockchain. The authors’\
    \ model used a self-sovereign model \nfor identity, distributed ledger storage,\
    \ credit score calcula-\ntion without any extra charges, and non-financial factor\
    \ for \nacquiring credit score. With bit-score being an improvisation \nover traditional\
    \ credit scoring techniques it makes the \ntransactions more transparent, decentralized,\
    \ secure, and \nintermediary-free.\n4.4.2  Mobile Money\nY. Hu, [150] proposed\
    \ a blockchain-based digital payment \nsystem to deliver reliable services on\
    \ unreliable network \nservices in rural areas. The system management contract\
    \ \nto record account types, user balances to avoid forks dur-\ning disconnection\
    \ with the help of smart contracts. True \ntransparency can be obtained through\
    \ digitization and eco-\nnomic growth can be boosted in poor countries. Ghatpande\
    \ \net al., [149] proposed a way of moving Secure, interoperable \nmobile money\
    \ in sub-Saharan Africa (SIGMMA) to sup-\nport semi-offline payments through blockchain.\
    \ The model \nprovides unreachable areas a monetary transaction solution \nwithout\
    \ having to provide any identity proof while ensuring \ntrust between parties\
    \ along with not having to physically \nvisit any bank.\n4.4.3  Cash Transfer\n\
    Another proposal is to provide banking solutions to rural \nareas where a chit\
    \ fund system has been designed by Kumar \nand Sangal, [154]. Chit fund being\
    \ a traditional saving \nscheme in India is an easier way to have access to credit.\
    \ The \npurpose of this system is to remove geographical barriers \nFig. 18  Blockchain\

    \ Unlike other anonymous blockchain applica-\ntions, this system requires identity\
    \ registration. Unlike tradi-\ntional co-lateral systems, blockchain generates\
    \ credit history \nto prohibit manipulation. Lastly, Jaffer et al., [153] proposed\
    \ \na blockchain-based distributed system that is immutable and \nsecures the\
    \ transaction logs. The self-executing smart con-\ntracts were used to automatically\
    \ execute real-world con-\ntracts for auto disbursement of subsidies on meeting\
    \ spe-\ncific conditions. This system overcoming traditional cash \ntransfers,\
    \ and corruption and manipulation related to it can \nbenefit rural or deserving\
    \ people.\n4.5  Healthcare\nIn the healthcare sector, smart healthcare systems,\
    \ telemedi-\ncine, and privacy in medical data sharing to provide security \n\
    and transparency in the healthcare system between doctors \nand patients were\
    \ the commonly addressed areas in related \nwork (Fig. 18). A detailed summary\
    \ is given in Table 11.\n4.5.1  Medical Data\nKaur et al., [157] proposed a blockchain-based\
    \ electronic \nmedical record storage and management system. The pro-\nposed model\
    \ consisted of three main components: Domain \nexperts (doctors, lab technicians,\
    \ pharmacists, and drug \nmanufacturers), health insurance providers, and patients.\
    \ To \nensure the privacy of medical data which contains most of \nthe private\
    \ information blockchain distributed data storage \nfor heterogeneous data was\
    \ proposed having a single source \nfor data storage and access while providing\
    \ high security \nand privacy to the users and researchers. Similarly, Zhang \n\
    et al., [158] proposed secure and scalable clinical data shar-\ning using FHIR\
    \ Chain, a blockchain-based system meeting \nONC (office of the national coordinator\
    \ for health informa-\ntion technology) requirements. The technical requirements\
    \ \nfor blockchain-based clinical data sharing were verifying \nidentity and authenticating\
    \ all participants, Storing and \nexchanging data securely, consistent Permissioned\
    \ access \nto data sources, applying consistent data formats, maintain-\ning modularity.\
    \ FHIRChain facilitates clinical data exchange \nwhile maintaining ownership.\n\
    4.5.2  Telemedicine\nGuo et al., [161] proposed an ABE scheme to achieve \ndynamic\
    \ authentication and authorization with higher flex-\nibility and efficiency for\
    \ the Medical on Demand services \nin the telemedicine system. The system uses\
    \ a Consor-\ntium Blockchain managed by multiple authorities. Medi-\ncal examinations\
    \ are uploaded to the database provided \nby Cloud Service Provider (CSP). The\
    \ medical results are \ndownloadable from Cloud only by Medical specialists. All\
    \ \nthe data is stored in Blocks of Blockchain hence prevent-\ning any manipulation\
    \ in health records. Through this system \nindependence of choice should be provided\
    \ to the patient \nwhether they want to enroll, leave, or change access poli-\n\
    cies. Nusrat et al., [160] proposed a model of a telemedicine \nsystem for medical\
    \ care and security of data of rural people \nby using blockchain technology.\
    \ The system consisted of sta-\ntions for primary treatment tests while storing\
    \ data directly \nin the blockchain. This system ensured communication and \n\
    data privacy to doctors and patients while also giving reli-\nable medical care\
    \ and benefits to underserved (rural) people.\nForbye, Yong et al., [159] have\
    \ proposed a blockchain \nand machine learning system for vaccine supply chain\
    \ trace-\nability. The novel intelligent system based on the blockchain \ncan\
    \ be used for vaccine supervision in the vaccine supply \nchain. Additionally,\
    \ using smart contracts for the vaccine \nsupply chain can provide the following\
    \ advantages: detection \nof expired vaccines, vaccine information, and vaccine\
    \ coin.\n4.5.3  Smart Healthcare System\nMachine Learning holds the power to change\
    \ the perception \nof understanding and analyzing data and decision-making in\
    \ \nmultifarious sectors. Since, the blockchain with its decen-\ntralized network\
    \ focus on secure data sharing, its integration \nwith machine learning would\
    \ provide a very meticulous out-\ncome. Few of the ways through which blockchain’s\
    \ integra-\ntion with machine learning and benefit the healthcare system \nare\
    \ [162]:\n(a) Blockchain ledger with legitimate data collection can \nfeed the\
    \ machine learning models with highly accurate \nand dependable data.\n(b) Real\
    \ data can be used to train machine learning models \nto increase efficiency and\
    \ precision, therefore, saving \ncost and time.\n(c) Models can be trained to\
    \ give the same health advice \nto multiple patients with alike symptoms.\n(d)\
    \ Models can also be trained to give better clinical solu-\ntions to doctors based\
    \ on the patient’s symptoms.\n(e) Training the models on the patient history and\
    \ storing \nthem on blockchain ledger can predict outbreaks.\nFor implementing\
    \ the integration, Jain et al., [156] pro-\nposed an integrated model of blockchain\
    \ and machine learn-\ning to detect diseases. These models can be implemented\
    \ \nin a hospital or rural medical camps. The proposed system \nconsisted of IoT,\
    \ blockchain, cybersecurity, and machine \nlearning. Various components measure\
    \ basic parameters of \nthe human body such as weight, pulse, blood pressure,\
    \ and \nautomatically saved the data in the ledger. The system has \nthe potential\
    \ to expand medical parameters while making it \n2456\n \nP. Kaur, A. Parashar\
    \ \n1 3\nadaptive. The complete system can collect, store, and ana-\nlyze the\
    \ data of the patient and benefit the doctors, patients, \nand medical institutions.\n\
    Similarly, Tripathi et al., [155] have proposed a safe and \nconvenient use of\
    \ medical data and its user through block-\nchain technology. The proposed work\
    \ is an improvement \non issues and challenges faced regarding security and pri-\n\
    vacy. The clinical data are recorded in the blockchain ledger \nwith access to\
    \ legitimate users only. For a doctor to access \na patient’s data a request has\
    \ to be made and only when \nthe patient approves the request does the data become\
    \ vis-\nible. The goal of this model is to provide secure and reliable \nservices\
    \ to insurance companies, drug supply chains, and \nmedical researchers. Lastly.\n\
    4.6  Employment\nThis application area mainly focused on employment vis-\nibility\
    \ and temporary employment for rural job security \n(Fig. 19). Therefore, the\
    \ following related research articles \nwere identified and a detailed summary\
    \ is given in Table 12.\n4.6.1  Temporary Employment\nPinna and Ibba, [163] proposed\
    \ a decentralized employment \nsystem to process employment contracts with a fully\
    \ auto-\nmated and fast procedure. The model consists of a new job \noffer event\
    \ in which awaiting employers apply for jobs, an \napplication event where a smart\
    \ contract acquires the appli-\ncation request, a hiring event where the applicant\
    \ worker \nmeets the employer, a relationship event to enable the work-\ners to\
    \ check working situation and details, the workday event \nwhich describes the\
    \ maturation of workdays, a payment \nevent where the employee gets paid. The\
    \ transparent ledger \ncan make sure that the employment contracts were deployed\
    \ \nwith unchangeable information.\n4.6.2  Employment Visibility\nSimilarly, the\
    \ paper’s proposal by M. et al., [164] ensures \nsupply chain visibility to seamlessly\
    \ connect all stakeholders \nof the supply chain network who are a part of the\
    \ Blockchain \necosystem. The paper defined two modules in BC design: the \nSupply\
    \ module and the demand module. Supply module to \ncollect worker's data and smart\
    \ contracts to perform transac-\ntions through an application interface and store\
    \ them on the \nledger. Demand module to implement job allocation. The \naggregators\
    \ are given direct access to help track worker’s \ninformation from the ledger.\n\
    4.7  Existing Systematic Literature Reviews\nA tabular representation of a few\
    \ major existing works of \nblockchain in rural development has been done in Table 13.\
    \ \nThis table communicates the area of literature reviews, and \ntheir main contributions\
    \ in the review regarding blockchain \nin rural or agriculture.\nAn extensive\
    \ literature review was done in this section \nwhich portrayed the enormous amount\
    \ of work done in \nblockchain technology pertaining to rural development. All\
    \ \nthe functional areas and sub-areas were compared and dis-\ncussed in tabular\
    \ form. Multiple novel ideas and theories \nwere identified during the literature\
    \ review. At last, a small \ntabular representation was made for the existing\
    \ systematic \nliterature reviews and surveys in a similar area to identify the\
    \ \ndepth of the work done. In the upcoming sections, critical \nanalysis and\
    \ detailed discussion have been done based on \nthe literature study, followed\
    \ by the limitations of the survey \nand conclusion.\nFig. 19  Blockchain applications\

    \ for Smart Villages \n1 3\n5  Critical Analysis Existing Technologies \nand Discussion\n\
    Blockchain Technology possesses much competence and \nfuturistic hold towards\
    \ rural development. In this review, \nall possible applications of blockchain\
    \ that facilitated rural \ndevelopment were found, reviewed, compared, and summa-\n\
    rized. With Agriculture being the predominant application \nof blockchain, various\
    \ areas under it were analyzed that \nworked on the relief of agricultural issues\
    \ in rural areas.\nStarting with Supply chain traceability, the study showed \n\
    integration of blockchain technology with Internet of Things \n[51, 54, 56, 58,\
    \ 63, 64, 69, 70, 73, 76, 82, 84, 85, 89, 100, \n145], Cloud computing [65, 87],\
    \ Big Data [87], and Geo-\nspatial Technology [100]. Among the papers discussed,\
    \ this \narea consisted of papers pertinent to tracing agricultural \nproduce\
    \ from the beginning of the process till it reached \nthe consumer. The range\
    \ of traceability options comprised \nall agricultural products as well as specifically\
    \ certain prod-\nucts such as soybean [60], grape wine [69], and cocoa beans \n\
    [62]. Furthermore, blockchain’s integration with IoT pro-\nvided sensing and sharing\
    \ of private data with blockchain \nwithout intermediary support. Additionally,\
    \ some proposed \nwork used QR codes [56, 60, 146] for viewing data directly \n\
    related to the attached product. Articles supporting IoT \ndevices were implemented\
    \ for tracing agricultural produce, \nencouraging circular economy, fault-tolerant,\
    \ and immutable \nAPIs. A few were reviews on agriculture traceability [53, \n\
    58, 60, 61] barriers [67], challenges [59, 71, 76] contribu-\ntion [80], IoT based\
    \ solutions, and future scopes [78, 96]. \nSome agricultural prototypes included\
    \ AgriBlockIoT [70], \nKHET [83], and FARMAR [68]. A few land record manage-\n\
    ment articles were also discussed that implied security and \nbroker-free methods\
    \ for land titling and transferring [97, 98]. \nMost of the platforms used were\
    \ Ethereum Smart Contracts, \nHyperledger, REST, JavaScript (Web3, node, angular),\
    \ Truf-\nfle Framework APIs, and MySQL and MongoDB for cloud \nstorage.\nWhile\
    \ traceability of agricultural produce is important, \nthe agriculture security\
    \ system is also a necessity. In this \nreview, the articles for agriculture security\
    \ systems included \nprevention of farm data from cyber-attacks using IoT [103]\
    \ \nand supervision of agricultural products and food informa-\ntion [102]. In\
    \ both the works acquired, it used Smart con-\ntracts and Ethereum Blockchain\
    \ respectively, along with \nIoT-based sensors for farm monitoring.\nOrganic Farming\
    \ as a part of agriculture application for \nsustainable farming and quality food\
    \ production included \ntwo articles for analyzing the effectiveness of supply\
    \ chain \n[101], and identifying product quality and transparency of \norganic\
    \ food supply chain using decentralized applications \nand QR codes for tracing\
    \ product data [104].\nTable 12  Comparison of blockchain applications in Employment\n\

    Furthermore, using smart methods to enhance the agri-\ncultural process was discusses\
    \ in the smart agriculture \nSect. 3.1.4 where farm controlling, recordkeeping,\
    \ improved \nlogistics, farm managing and improvising, and monitoring \nusing\
    \ Blockchain Technology and IoT [106–110] as well \nas cloud computing [105] and\
    \ geospatial technology [100] \nin some articles were covered. Most emphases were\
    \ given \ntowards improving the quality of farming and its man-\nagement while\
    \ providing utmost security to data. Mostly \nused platforms to implement the\
    \ proposed work were \nJavaScript(Node, Ganache, Truffle), Ethereum Smart Con-\n\
    tracts, and IoT-based sensors.\nApart from the supply chain in farming, the dairy\
    \ sector \nwas one of the application areas covered in the review com-\nprising\
    \ of E-governance in the dairy sector implemented on \nsmart contracts [111],\
    \ and quality and quantity assurance \nof milk with a delivery platform [112]\
    \ using Blockchain \nTechnology. In addition to the dairy sector, blockchain appli-\n\
    cations in livestock management using Blockchain Technol-\nogy [114], IoT and\
    \ Cloud Computing [113, 115, 147] to \nmonitor livestock, observe cattle using\
    \ RFID tags, storing \ndetailed information on fishes, along with livestock trace-\n\
    ability were discussed in the review. Integration with IoT \nprovided real-time\
    \ monitoring and traceability of livestock \nand its by-products in the supply\
    \ chain.\nSimilarly, to share informative farming data and tech-\nniques a review\
    \ on convenience analysis of the blockchain \nin agriculture [116], and exploratory\
    \ data planning and \nmanagement of agricultural food supply chain for sustain-\n\
    able development [117] was given to explore the work done \nin E-agriculture using\
    \ blockchain technology. Since one \nof the main motives towards implementing\
    \ blockchain in \nagriculture is to monitor the faring process and products \n\
    till it reaches the consumer, therefore, agriculture monitor-\ning section covered\
    \ farm monitoring system[99], a yield \nestimation system to share farming plans\
    \ implemented on \nsmart contracts [119], and an IoT based AG Wallet system to\
    \ \ntrack farm activity implemented using IBM enterprise block-\nchain platform\
    \ [118]. Penultimately, the application area was \ndivided into farmer Sect. 3.1.9\
    \ where blockchain’s reviews \nto facilitate farmers such as farmer’s portal to\
    \ capture farm \nactivities using HTML and Python [121], farmer’s data stor-\n\
    age to provide transparency for government scheme using \nsmart contracts [120],\
    \ and farmer’s data accessing using \ntheir consent [122] were discussed.\nLastly,\
    \ an overall blockchain application area covering the \nuse of incentives for\
    \ numerous activities was discussed in \nSect. 3.1.10. The review included a reward-based\
    \ system in \nreturn for solid waste [148], rural waste [128], anonymously \n\
    reporting an activity [130], reporting an accident [127], stor-\ning educational\
    \ records in ledger [132], green behavior [123, \n124], geotagging litters [125],\
    \ and to safely share medical \ndata [126]. The incentive mechanism works when\
    \ an activ-\nity is performed, therefore in return for good behaviors or \nactivity,\
    \ cryptocurrency-based tokens are rewarded that can \nbe stored in a blockchain\
    \ wallet. Most of the platforms used \nwere smart contracts while some of the\
    \ systems also used \nARK Blockchain, Laravel PHP, and JavaScript.\nLooking through\
    \ the applications of blockchain in rural \nareas, usage of blockchain in reinforcing\
    \ environmental \nconditions and changing people's outlook on preserving the \n\
    environment was the outcome of factors affecting rural peo-\nple as they were\
    \ much likely also related to environmental \nconditions. From this view, the\
    \ environmental application \nareas were discovered and discussed to be Water\
    \ manage-\nment, Waste management, and Natural hazards.\nTo begin with, under\
    \ Sect. 3.2.3 water management, \nsmart measuring and monitoring [137], smart\
    \ consump-\ntion [135], management [139], and control system [136] \nof water\

    \ smart contracts in the first two propos-\nals and UML, TLA + for the latter.\n\
    Lastly, as per the research criteria, only one article con-\ntributing to the\
    \ environment and natural hazards was dis-\ncovered and reviewed explaining the\
    \ insurance system for \ndrought-affected farms based on the farm data stored\
    \ in the \nblockchain ledger [134]. The model was implemented on \nNEO virtual\
    \ machine, smart contracts, and used Oracle \nserver as database.\nSimilarly,\
    \ from the challenges faced by rural people \nacquiring an electric line, energy-efficient\
    \ methods, to \nsecure, and transparent payments issues were covered and \nreviewed\
    \ under the energy section. The blockchain applica-\ntion areas in the energy\
    \ sector were discovered to be Renew-\nable energy and the Energy grid. With blockchain’s\
    \ integra-\ntion with renewable energy a smart contract-based energy \ntransfer\
    \ credibility system of biomass energy grid [143], \nand a case study of sub-Saharan\
    \ Africa and its challenges \nand adoption of renewable energy access were discussed\
    \ \n[142]. Whereas in the energy grid section, the blockchain’s \napplication\
    \ in providing peer-to-peer electrification with \nsecure payments, transparent\
    \ energy usage [144], and the \nuse of smart energy grids for farming and irrigation\
    \ using \nEthereum Blockchain [140] were reviewed.\nBesides, from the traditional\
    \ use of blockchain in Finance, \nthe banking solutions for rural people were\
    \ discussed in \nSect. 3.4. From the banking applications of blockchain, the \n\
    use of mobile money for semi-offline payments in sub-Saha-\nran Africa without\
    \ identity proof using a secure, interoper-\nable mobile money system [149], and\
    \ a delay-tolerant digital \npayment system based on Ethereum blockchain [150]\
    \ were \ndiscussed. A simpler way of getting a loan with the help \nof blockchain\
    \ is by using a hyper ledger fabric-based Loan \nOn Blockchain(LOC) system using\
    \ smart contracts [151], \nand a credit scoring system called Bit-score using\
    \ Ethereum \nBlockchain [152] were discussed. Finally, a Cash Transfer \narea\
    \ where a distributed system for automatic subsidy deliv-\nery and fund release\
    \ using JavaScript and Hyperledger com-\nposer [153], and a chit fund system based\
    \ on smart contracts \nto provide credit to rural people [154] were reviewed.\n\
    Under the Healthcare applications of blockchain, A Smart \nHealthcare System,\
    \ Medical Data sharing, and Telemedi-\ncine were the areas discovered. Under smart\
    \ healthcare, the \narticles reviewed were a smart model to detect diseases and\
    \ \nmeasure basic health parameters using Ethereum blockchain \nand Raspberry\
    \ Pi [156] and protected access to medical \ndata using smart contracts [155].\
    \ For the recordkeeping of \nmedical data and share it legitimately an electronic\
    \ medi-\ncal record storage management system based on ethereum \nand cloud storage\
    \ [157], and a permissioned clinical data \nsharing called FHIRChain using smart\
    \ contracts [158] was \nreviewed. Lastly, under Telemedicine, vaccine supervision\
    \ \nand traceability for safe vaccine supply [159], secure data \nstorage using\
    \ telemedicine system based on smart contracts \n[160], and a telemedicine system\
    \ to prevent health records \nmanipulation using Blockchain and Cloud Database\
    \ [161] \nwere the articles reviewed.\nAnother challenge faced by rural people\
    \ implemented to \nrecuperate from unemployment using blockchain technol-\nogy\
    \ was discussed in Sect. 3.6. Using smart contracts an \nemployment contracts\
    \ processing, handling, and safe pay-\nment system for temporary employment contracts\
    \ [163], and \na blockchain aggregator to perform worker data transactions \n\
    and employment visibility [164] were the works reviewed \nin this section.\n5.1\
    \  Limitations of Existing Works and Research \nGaps\nIn this section, the limitations\
    \ of the existing literature \nreview on blockchain in rural development along\
    \ with \na comparison of existing systematic literature reviews \nhave been discussed.\
    \ The comparison has been shown in \nTable 14, and a few research gaps have been\
    \ mentioned in \nthis section as well.\nWhile Blockchain technology is leading\
    \ in security and \ntransparency, providing ways of applying its technology in\
    \ \ndisparate areas its limitations and gaps can still be identi-\nfied in the\
    \ proposed and implemented work. While most \nof the work in agriculture is for\
    \ ensuring transparency and \ntraceability in the supply chain, there are far\
    \ more factors in \nagriculture that affect farmers and crops. Blockchain inevi-\n\
    tably uses excessive energy in execution, but its execution in \nrural areas may\
    \ become worrisome due to the lack of energy \nand load in those areas.\nCollecting\
    \ farm data and storing them on the ledger in \nsmall farms is easier. However,\
    \ in the case of big farms, the \ndata collection and integration may consume\
    \ much time and \nprobably manpower in accumulating and loading it in the \nledger.\
    \ Apart from that, IoT-based services require sensors \nas well as collecting\
    \ livestock DNA to trace them and load \ntheir information may cost a fortune\
    \ to small-scale farmers.\nTeaching the application usage to laymen, that too\
    \ unedu-\ncated farmers or rural people may become a troubling task. \nNot only\
    \ that, the availability of news of the latest technolo-\ngies is hardly accessible\
    \ to underdeveloped countries, intro-\nducing blockchain-based applications to\
    \ those areas may toil \nthe deployment and utilization.\n2460\n \nP. Kaur, A. Parashar\

    \ while \nmaking blockchain transactions. A lost private key or a mis-\ntakenly\
    \ added extra digit to the payment can cause irrevers-\nible damage.\nThereafter,\
    \ a data breach of medical data and inappro-\npriate access to medical histories\
    \ are some issues that may \ndecrease people’s trust in the blockchain-based healthcare\
    \ \nsystem for medical data privacy.\nSecurity threat is another limitation that\
    \ can affect any \ntype of application that requires recordkeeping. Here the \n\
    blockchain’s main characteristics may itself prove faulty to \nfind the intruder\
    \ as it gives total anonymity to users. With \nboth pros and cons, robust and\
    \ reliable technology can still \nbe deployed for many usages, making livability\
    \ easier and \npeople technologically advanced.\n5.2  Discussion\nMultiple issues\
    \ pertaining to rural areas have been addressed \nby authors with the help of\
    \ blockchain. Agriculture is the \nmost economic factor, solutions for blockchain-based\
    \ sup-\nply chain traceability provided secure, transparent, beneficial \nproduct\
    \ delivery. It also ensured timely payments to farm-\ners and quality products\
    \ to consumers. Banking solutions \nhave also been made easier with blockchain\
    \ technology, pro-\nviding remote banking solutions, credit and loan easiness,\
    \ \nand easy and transparent banking. Hygiene issues that led \nto many diseases,\
    \ generational disabilities have also been \ngiven a solution through blockchain\
    \ which also incentivizes \nrural people for participating in waste and water\
    \ manage-\nment. Rural electrification solutions were also proposed with \nblockchain\
    \ for people unable to obtain energy resources, \nbasic electrical amenities,\
    \ and expensive bills. People who \nwere unable to receive treatments, had to\
    \ travel long dis-\ntances for medical assistance, were also provided a block-\n\
    chain solution with which telemedicine, privacy to medical \ndata usage, and medical-on-demand\
    \ were made available. \nBlockchain has also been useful in providing employment\
    \ \nsolutions to the truly underserved, using a global chain \nfor employment\
    \ visibility, and secure payment for jobs \n[168–172].\nThe Systematic Literature\
    \ Review’s objective is to pro-\nvide information on the research proposed related\
    \ to block-\nchain in rural development to provide new research oppor-\ntunities,\
    \ extensive knowledge about each development area, \nand the possibility for future\
    \ development in rural areas. \nAfter distinctly reviewing every research article\
    \ variant areas \nof applications were identified relating to the development\
    \ of \nFig. 20  Blockchain Applications and their Areas in rural development\n\
    2462\n \nP. Kaur, A. Parashar \n1 3\nrural areas with the help of Blockchain Technology.\
    \ Overall, \n6 disparate applications in rural development were picked \nout;\
    \ from which each of these applications has a total of 23 \ndivergent areas combined.\
    \ These areas contribute to all the \nresearch that has been done in the blockchain\
    \ in the rural \ndevelopment sector and are distributed across 37 countries \n\
    obtained from 6 journals and 1 web source ranging from \nthe years 2010 to 2020.\
    \ After searching through journals, \napplying more than 16 keywords, 112 articles\
    \ were found in \naggregate. From analyzing each article, the primary applica-\n\
    tion of blockchain was identified as agriculture with 67% of \nresearch articles\
    \ relative to blockchain in agriculture whence \n60% were associated with supply\
    \ chain traceability. About \n55% of those papers were from the Institute of Electrical\
    \ and \nElectronics Engineers (IEEE). Furthermore, in 112 research \npapers, 8\
    \ technologies were implemented with a total of 58 \nplatforms and tools combined.\n\
    5.3  Research Questions Addressed\nFrom the Research Questions defined (Table 3),\
    \ the follow-\ning inference can be made:\nRQ1 What are the main applications\
    \ and areas of imple-\nmenting Blockchain Technology in Rural Development?\nVarious\
    \ extensively researched applications are defined \nin Tables 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,\
    \ 11 and 12. These applications \ndefine the Blockchain’s applications in rural\
    \ development \nthat impact the rural areas, provide security, opportunities,\
    \ \navailability of resources, and a better lifestyle. The areas \n(Fig. 20) gave\
    \ extensive knowledge about the domains of \napplication-defined from several\
    \ research articles related to \nit.\nRQ2 What are the major issues in Rural Development\
    \ and \nhow they can be addressed using Blockchain Technology?\nNumerous issues\
    \ in rural areas are explained in Sect. 1.1.1 \nand the blockchain applications\
    \ for the eradication of those \nissues are addressed in Sect. 3.\nRQ3 What are\
    \ the targeted software, platforms, and tools \nfor the implementation of blockchain\
    \ in rural development?\nThroughout the applications, for implementation follow-\n\
    ing (Table 15) technologies’ integration, and software and \nplatforms were used:\n\
    RQ4.  What are the research gaps and future research direc-\ntions for applying\
    \ blockchain technology to rural \ndevelopment?\nFollowing the review, in agriculture,\
    \ most emphases were \nstated towards supply chain traceability and less or no\
    \ work \nin natural resource management, overproduction, yield stag-\nnation,\
    \ and international trade. In regards to the sociological \nfactor, research on\
    \ work belonging to blockchain develop-\nment for rural education, housing, women\
    \ empowerment, \ncrime reduction, brain drain, and craftsmanship is missing. \n\
    For the implementation of banking, healthcare, and many \nother applications the\
    \ required government and technologi-\ncal assist are still lacking. In some cases,\
    \ the research pro-\nposed could be administered only in the far future, therefore\
    \ \ncontemporary work was absent. Some more gaps and future \nresearch directions\
    \ are given in Sects. 4.2 and 6.1.\nThe research questions mentioned in Table \
    \ 3 are \naddressed in the following section (Table 16):\n6  Threat to Validity\
    \ and Limitation \nof the Survey\nWhile reviewing the issues in rural areas, blockchain\

    \ for Smart Villages \n1 3\n2.3. During exclusion, some articles were not considered\
    \ fit \nfor this review, were missed, or were not found. Six appli-\ncations were\
    \ considered in this review, there could be more \napplications that we couldn’t\
    \ figure or that couldn’t make the \ncut of criteria. A total of 23 sub-areas\
    \ of all the applications \nwere determined. Conclusively, as per our knowledge,\
    \ there \nwasn’t any systematic review that reviewed all the applica-\ntion areas\
    \ of blockchain technology in rural and sustainable \ndevelopment nevertheless\
    \ there could have been a few rural \nand sustainable development articles that\
    \ weren’t included \nin this review.\n7  Conclusion and Future Work\nBlockchain\
    \ Technology has presented a considerable amount \nof work in the rural sector.\
    \ While its implementation was \nfew, the ideology is enough to motivate people\
    \ into changing \nthe lifestyle of rural people leading to the overall country’s\
    \ \ndevelopment. In this systematic literature review, numerous \napplications\
    \ of blockchain technology in sustainable rural \ndevelopment were discussed with\
    \ diverse areas in each \napplication. A comparative study of each application\
    \ in all \nthe areas pertaining to different approaches has been por-\ntrayed\
    \ with differing attributes elucidating the technology, \nprocess, and techniques\
    \ behind each article. The paper pro-\nvides extensive literature towards each\
    \ of the articles sorted \nafter applying the review process consisting of relevant\
    \ arti-\ncles and keywords. The primary findings of the systematic \nliterature\
    \ review were as follows:\n(a) From the review, we were able to identify common\
    \ and \nexceptional uses of blockchain technology that would \nhelp uplift the\
    \ rural community and lead to sustainable \nrural development.\n(b) Various distinct\
    \ approaches to implementing block-\nchain technology for rural welfare were discovered.\n\
    (c) Platforms and tools that would facilitate the use of these \napplications\
    \ for farmers and uninstructed agrestic peo-\nple were identified and reviewed.\n\
    (d) Blockchain’s integration with multiple powerful tech-\nnologies for rural\
    \ development was reviewed.\n(e) An overall idea for a collaborative approach\
    \ leading to \na smart village framework was constructed.\nThe gaps determined\
    \ from reviewing the articles broadly \nwould help researchers explore additional\
    \ as well as alter-\nnative utilization of blockchain technology for sustainable\
    \ \nrural development.\n7.1  Future Work\nBlockchain’s characteristics are exceptionally\
    \ conducive to \nsafety, privacy, integrity, traceability, efficiency, and trans-\n\
    parency in every area limited by such advantages. While \ndiverse blockchain applications\
    \ for the welfare of rural \ncommunity has been discussed nevertheless future\
    \ work \ncan comprise of facilitating applications in making use of \nblockchain\
    \ incentives for a collaborative framework incor-\nporating several services in\
    \ rural areas namely Smart Vil-\nlage. Blockchain technology in terms of providing\
    \ incentive \nmechanisms could lead to a better motivational unit in many \nareas.\
    \ Incentivizing rural or urban people for education, data \nsharing, green farming,\
    \ green behavior, and environment \nconservation are real future demands. Apart\
    \ from empha-\nsizing rural areas, blockchain’s integration with network-\ning,\
    \ cybersecurity, and digital advertising is also a future \ninsistence.\nFunding\

    inclusion, and governance. The response is well-organized and provides a clear
    summary of each application area.

  explanation: 'Blockchain technology is a distributed ledger system that allows for
    secure and tamper-proof recording of transactions across multiple parties. It
    has been gaining prominence in supply chain management due to its potential to
    enhance transparency, efficiency, and traceability. A recent study conducted by
    researchers at Maher A. N. Agi and Ashish Kumar Jha sought to identify and evaluate
    the enablers of blockchain technology adoption in supply chains. Drawing upon
    an extensive literature review and theoretical lenses from the Diffusion of Innovation
    and Business Technology Adoption Model developed by Iacovou, Benbasat, and Dexter
    (1995), the study identified 20 enablers of blockchain adoption in supply chains,
    which were then assessed using the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory
    (DEMATEL) method to determine their relative importance and interrelationships.


    The study''s findings revealed that both external pressure and relative advantage
    are the two most prominent categories of enablers that impact blockchain adoption
    in supply chains. Within these categories, specific enablers such as customer
    interest in the traceability and other product-related data on blockchain (E17),
    establishing regulatory frameworks for using blockchain technology (E19), and
    lowering transaction costs (E7) emerged as the most influential factors driving
    blockchain adoption.


    Furthermore, the study also highlighted the importance of cooperation and collaboration
    among supply chain partners to foster blockchain adoption. Enablers related to
    cooperation, such as establishing appropriate and clear governance rules for blockchain
    platforms (E15), cooperating for process standardization (E12), and developing
    common supply chain objectives from using the technology (E13), were found to
    be significant enablers of blockchain adoption.


    Overall, this study provides insights into the key factors and drivers that influence
    the adoption of blockchain technology in supply chains. Understanding these enablers
    is crucial for companies and supply chain managers seeking to leverage the benefits
    of blockchain technology to enhance their supply chain operations and gain a competitive
    advantage.'
  extract_1: Lower transaction cost (E7), customer interest in the traceability information
    and other product-related data on blockchain (E17), management commitment (E4),

    between supply chain members for process standardization and agreement on the
    type and level of details of the data to be shared on the blockchain (E12), respectively.
  extract_2: Our results also show that establishing regulatory framework for using
    blockchain technology (E19) is an important cause enabler ranked fourth in prominence.

    • 20 enablers of blockchain adoption in the supply chain are identified. • An
    integrated approach based on the diffusion of innovation and business technology
    adoption model is used. • The prominence and interrelationships between different
    blockchain adoption enablers are established. • Insights on enhancing blockchain
    adoption in the supply chain are given. Abstract Blockchain technology has been
    growing in importance and acceptability over the past few years. Yet, there is
    limited empirical research on the organizational and technology specific factors
    that play a critical role in driving its adoption in the supply chain. The purpose
    of this paper is to develop a comprehensive framework for blockchain adoption
    in the supply chain by identifying the enablers and empirically evaluating their
    interdependencies and impact on adoption. 20 enablers of blockchain adoption in
    the supply chain are identified using an extensive literature review and theoretical
    lenses from the Diffusion of Innovation (DOI) theory and the business technology
    adoption model developed by Iacovou, Benbassat and Dexter (1995). In the confirmatory
    phase, we employ the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL)
    method to extract logic from data collected from 37 French experts about the impact
    of the enablers and their interdependencies. Our paper extends the multi-theoretic
    empirical studies to blockchain technology and identifies the enablers of blockchain
    adoption from technological, organizational, supply chain and external environment
    perspectives. Regarding the importance of the categories of enablers, we find
    that the relative advantage of the technology and the external pressure are the
    most prominent categories of enablers that impact blockchain adoption in the supply
    chain. Our analysis also shows the important causal role on adoption of the potential
    of blockchain to reduce transaction cost, the consumer interest in traceability
    data and the establishment of a regulatory framework for blockchain usage. Previous

    chain managementDEMATEL 1. Introduction Blockchain technology has recently gained
    importance as a promising technology in the area of supply chain management. For
    instance, Maersk used an IBM blockchain solution to efficiently track its containers
    around the world (Popper and Lohr, 2017). Catina Volpone vineyard (www.cantinavolpone.it)
    in Puglia, Italy and Ernst and Young''s EZ Lab (www.ezlab.it) developed a blockchain-based
    solution that enables full transparency through the wine supply chain and allows
    customers to access information about the harvesting, pressing, and bottling dates
    and conditions, among many other details for each bottle or case of wine (Montecchi
    et al., 2019). Similarly, Walmart and IBM have successfully implemented a blockchain-based
    solution for tracking pork products in China with a farm-to-table approach, providing
    transparency and full information about the supply chain stages every individual
    product went through (Yiannas, 2017). Blockchain solutions providers such as Everledger
    (everledger.io), Provenance (provenance.org), Bext360 (bext360.com) conducted
    pilot projects and offered typical use cases that demonstrate blockchain potential
    in verifying and certifying the origin, authenticity and integrity of products
    such as diamond, wine buttles, luxury fashion, coffee beans, and medicines (Kshetri,
    2018; Montecchi et al., 2019; Lacity, 2018; Tönnissen and Teuteberg, 2020). Enabling
    traceability, enhancing transparency and establishing product provenance as shown
    in the above examples are not the only benefits of using blockchain technology.
    Indeed, blockchain is a distributed ledger (database) through which supply chain
    partners can interact and create, verify, validate, and securely store various
    kinds of records such as product information, certificates, localization data,
    transaction records, data acquired from sensors and other connected devices (Crosby
    et al., 2016; Iansiti and Lakhani, 2017). Thus, in addition to providing traceability
    and making the whole history of products digitally available, blockchain promises
    to improve supply chain coordination and process efficiency (Kshetri, 2018; Babich
    and Hilary, 2020; Queiroz et al., 2020; Wamba et al., 2020) and to achieve supply
    chain sustainability goals (Casey and Wong, 2017; Kouhizadeh and Sarkis, 2018;
    Kshetri, 2018; Babich and Hilary, 2020). Despite the promises and the enormous
    potential of blockchain technology, its adoption in supply chains is still underexplored.
    Few studies address this question, offering a fragmented view of adoption''s enablers.
    Our objective in this research is to further investigate blockchain adoption in
    supply chains, develop a comprehensive framework for adoption enablers, measure
    their level of influence and understand their mutual relationships. Our work answers
    the following questions: RQ1: What are the enablers of blockchain technology adoption
    in the supply chain? RQ2: What are the levels of influence of the identified enablers
    on the adoption decision? RQ3: How do the enablers interact and influence each
    other? We base our study on an integrative theoretical approach that combines
    the Diffusion of Innovation (DoI) theory (Rogers, 2010) and the business technology
    adoption model developed in Iacovou, Benbasat and Dexter (1995). The choice of
    these theoretical lenses allows us to extend the technology adoption framework
    to include factors related to the technology itself, the organization at both
    the firm and the supply chain levels, and the environment. As for the empirical
    investigation, we use the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL)
    methodology (Gabus and Fontela, 1972) to analyze data collected from experts in
    supply chain or IT management working in France. DEMATEL is very appropriate for
    our purpose because it is designed for modeling relationships and interdependencies
    between a large number of factors and evaluating their impact. Our paper provides
    both theoretical and practical contributions that improve our understanding of
    the enablers of blockchain adoption in supply chains and offer guidance to managers
    and policymakers on how they can best direct their efforts to enhance adoption.
    From the theory perspective, our work is the first effort to provide an extensive
    list of enabling factors of blockchain adoption in supply chains, evaluate their
    effects and map their interdependencies. It also adds contribution to the very
    limited body of research that uses a multi-theoretic framework to establish the
    theoretical context of blockchain technology adoption for the supply chain management.
    Our study also contributes to the practice by providing an evaluation of the importance
    of the enablers of blockchain adoption in the supply chain and by analyzing their
    interdependencies. Managers and policymakers may use the results and insights
    from this study to inform their decisions and action plans for blockchain adoption
    in their supply chains. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows.
    In Section 2, we provide an overview of the literature on blockchain technology
    applications in supply chain management and its adoption. In Section 3, we develop
    a theoretical framework for considering blockchain adoption in supply chains and
    identify the enablers of adoption from the literature. Research methodology and
    data collection are presented in Section 4. The results obtained are presented
    and discussed in Section 5. Then, Section 6 presents implications and managerial
    insights from our study, and Section 7 conclude the paper. 2. Background 2.1.
    Blockchain technology Blockchain technology can be defined as a peer-to-peer network
    technology that is used to build and maintain distributed ledgers or databases
    of records (Crosby et al., 2016; Iansiti and Lakhani, 2017). Parties participating
    in a blockchain (firms, institutions, individuals, etc.) can interact with each
    other and create all kinds of records (product information, certificates, localization
    data, transaction records, data acquired from sensors, etc.). Before being stored
    on the blockchain, records are verified and validated using specific consensus
    mechanisms (Crosby et al., 2016). Then, records are combined to form a block of
    data that is linked with previous blocks to form a chain of blocks or a “blockchain”.
    Data in a blockchain is ordered chronologically, every block of the chain contains
    a hash of the previous blocks, and the whole database is replicated and stored
    on different nodes of the system (Crosby et al., 2016). There exist public (permissionless)
    and private (permissioned) blockchains (Casey and Wong, 2017). A public blockchain
    is generally open and allows everyone to have access to the data. A typical example
    of an open blockchain is the one used to develop Bitcoin. On the opposite, a private
    blockchain is restrained to a given number of predefined participants who may
    have different levels of permission to record and access data. Both public and
    private blockchains are characterized by the implementation of consensus mechanisms
    to validate data, the use of cryptographic links between the blocks of the chain
    and the creation of replicates of the whole database in multiple nodes of the
    network (Crosby et al., 2016; Casey and Wong, 2017). These characteristics offer
    the guarantee that data recorded on a blockchain is valid, immune against any
    alteration and protected against the failure of some of the nodes of the system
    (Crosby et al., 2016; Casey and Wong, 2017; Babich and Hilary, 2020). Though blockchain
    technology was first created and implemented to support cryptocurrency transactions
    (Nakamoto, 2008), it found application in various domains and business sectors
    (Carson et al., 2018; Lacity, 2018). Across sectors, multiple use cases demonstrate
    the high potential of blockchain technology in achieving operations and supply
    chain management goals (Hackius and Petersen, 2017; Kshetri, 2018; Queiroz et
    al., 2020). 2.2. Use of blockchain technology in supply chain management A supply
    chain is typically composed of independent organizations which are directly involved
    in the upstream and downstream flows of products, services, finances, and/or information
    from a source to a customer (Mentzer et al., 2001). Effective management of a
    supply chain requires members to cooperate and mutually share information (Gunasekaran
    et al., 2001; Tan et al., 2002; Carr and Kaynak, 2007; Fawcett et al., 2011).
    In this regard, blockchain technology promises to drastically improve supply chain
    management and achieve supply chain performance objectives by providing a platform
    for direct interaction between supply chain members to exchange credible and tamper-proof
    data (Casey and Wong, 2017; Kshetri, 2018; Babich and Hilary, 2020; Queiroz et
    al., 2020; Wamba et al., 2020). One of the main benefits of this technology is
    that it enables full product traceability and enhances visibility through the
    different supply chain stages (Casey and Wong, 2017; Babich and Hilary, 2020).
    For instance, using smart tagging and blockchain technology, the UK-based blockchain
    solutions provider Provenance was able to successfully track fish caught by fishermen
    in Indonesia, and provide robust proof of compliance to standards from the origin
    and along the chain to consumers (https://www.provenance.org). Another example
    of blockchain-enabled product tracking is the pilot project conducted by Walmart
    in collaboration with IBM to digitally track pork products in China from the farm
    to the customer table. The technology enabled timely digital access to full individual
    pork product data, including the farm it comes from, factory it went through,
    the batch number, the storage temperature and shipping details (Yiannas, 2017).
    In addition to product tracking, blockchain offers powerful solutions for acquiring
    and aggregating detailed product information that may be used to authenticate
    products and certify their origin, as well as to assure product quality and integrity
    (Montecchi et al., 2019). For instance, the startup Everledger (https://www.everledger.io)
    has developed blockchain-based solutions to create and maintain unique identifying
    data for individual units of products in various sectors. The solutions are used
    for tracking and authenticating wine bottles (Kshetri, 2018), as well as for providing
    quality assurance and helping jewelers comply with regulations in diamond industry
    (Casey and Wong, 2017). Blockchain may also be used by Supply chain members to
    share demand, inventory, and capacity-related data. This data may then be selectively
    aggregated through the different tiers of the supply chain and used to improve
    supply chain coordination and operational efficiency (Babich and Hilary, 2020).
    A higher degree of coordination and operational efficiency may also be obtained
    through the implementation of blockchain enabled smart contracts to automate transactions
    among supply chain members (Babich and Hilary, 2020; Wang et al., 2019). Blockchain
    technology is instrumental in achieving supply chain sustainability goals (Kouhizadeh
    and Sarkis, 2018; Kshetri, 2018; Babich and Hilary, 2020). Indeed, product provenance
    knowledge helps in fighting against product counterfeiting (Alzahrani, N., and
    Bulusu, N., 2018; Montecchi et al., 2019), while product tracking capabilities
    help in better planning and implementing reverse logistics operations, such as
    product takeback, product reuse, remanufacturing, and recycling (Kouhizadeh and
    Sarkis, 2018; Babich and Hilary, 2020). The technology may also be used by supply
    chain members to share sustainability-related data from the different processing
    and transportation stages the product went through. Then, by aggregating this
    data, the overall product carbon footprint can be efficiently evaluated, as it
    has been demonstrated by Shakhbulatov et al. (2019) for transportation operations
    in the food industry. Blockchain technology may also be used by Supply chain members
    to upload certificates of compliance with different sustainability standards,
    which may then be compiled to ascertain claims of product and supply chain sustainability
    (Kouhizadeh and Sarkis, 2018; Babich and Hilary, 2020). Furthermore, using blockchain
    technology is believed to improve supply chain risk management (Kouhizadeh and
    Sarkis, 2018; Kshetri, 2018; Babich and Hilary, 2020) and supply chain resilience
    (Dubey et al., 2020) in addition to lowering transaction costs between the supply
    chain members (Kshetri, 2018; Schmidt and Wagner, 2019; Wamba et al., 2020). 2.3.
    Adoption of blockchain technology in the supply chain The innovative nature of
    blockchain technology and its potential for improving supply chain management
    has woken the interest in investigating the challenges and enablers of its adoption
    in supply chain context. In a pioneering work, Casey and Wong (2017) discussed
    the obstacles related to blockchain technology adoption in global supply chains
    and highlighted the challenges related to the interoperability between different
    blockchains and the complexity of the rules and regulations that govern contracting
    and commercial exchange, especially across national borders. Thus, to further
    encourage blockchain adoption in global supply chains, the authors advocate agreeing
    on standards and rules for interoperability between blockchains, as well as adapting
    current regulations and industry practices to the new dematerialized, automated
    and global nature of blockchains (Casey and Wong, 2017). Drawing on in-depth interviews
    with supply chain experts, Wang et al. (2019) reported on the perceived challenging
    nature of the complexity of the technology and its high cost of implementation.
    They also highlighted the need for establishing clear governance rules for blockchains
    and providing interoperability between two or more different blockchains and between
    blockchains and other existing systems, in addition to resolving the problematic
    question of data ownership. Leveraging lessons from RFID implementation research
    by using a multi-approach methodology based on focus group, survey and cases,
    van Hoek (2019) highlighted the importance of multiple internal and external drivers
    in addition to management commitment for blockchain implementation. In a study
    involving four supply chains in the dairy food sector, Behnke and Janssen (2020)
    identified 18 boundary conditions for using blockchain solutions to provide product
    traceability. These conditions were then aggregated in 5 categories which are:
    firm''s internal business processes and information system-related conditions
    such as the technical capacity and ability of different supply chain members to
    maintain traceability; supply chain process conditions that involve the interface
    and consistency between internal and external supply chain-related processes;
    traceability conditions that comprise consensus between supply chain members on
    the type, level of details and granularity of traceability data; quality-related
    conditions that involve consistency between supply chain members with regards
    to quality data; and regulatory conditions in relation with compliance to different
    product, country or customer-specific regulations. Using an integrative framework
    composed of institutional, market and technical factors Janssen et al. (2020)
    suggest that blockchain adoption may be negatively impacted by the resistance
    of organizations to change, the lack of understanding of the technology, the need
    for new regulations, the need for appropriate governance framework of blockchain,
    the cost of adoption and implementation of blockchain, the need for standardizing
    the information exchange processes, among other factors. Focusing on blockchain
    technology used for managing supply chain sustainability, Saberi et al. (2019)
    identified four groups of barriers that may hinder the adoption of this technology:
    intra-organizational barriers, inter-organizational barriers, system-related barriers,
    and external barriers. Building on Saberi et al. (2019) and using the Technology,
    Organization, and Environment (TOE) framework, Kouhizadeh et al. (2021) analyze
    the relations between the four groups of barriers and their impact on the adoption
    of blockchain solutions for managing sustainability in supply chains. Their results
    demonstrate that the lack of management commitment and support, lack of knowledge
    and expertise, lack of cooperation, coordination and information disclosure between
    supply chain members, lack of policies and industry involvement are prominent
    barriers to blockchain adoption for the sustainable supply chain management. The
    above works are mostly oriented towards identifying impediments and challenges
    of blockchain technology implementation in supply chains. Adopting a different
    perspective, Kamble et al. (2020) examined the enabling factors of blockchain
    adoption for traceability in agriculture supply chain and highlighted the positive
    influence of the blockchain-enabled reduction of transaction cost, information
    sharing and data security. In a study of the organizational enablers of blockchain
    adoption in supply chains, Clohessy and Acton (2019) found that top management
    support and organizational readiness are significant determinants of blockchain
    adoption, and large companies are more likely to adopt blockchain than small to
    medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Using the TOE framework and survey results, Wong
    et al. (2020) find that blockchain complexity, cost and relative advantage have
    significant effects on the intention to adopt blockchain technology for supply
    chain management in Malaysian SMEs. Considering blockchain adoption by individual
    users in supply chain context, Kamble et al. (2019) find that perceived usefulness
    is a determinant factor of technology adoption by practitioners. Queiroz and Wamba
    (2019) also build and test a model for blockchain adoption by supply chain practitioners
    and demonstrate that higher performance expectancy (i.e., improvement in job activities
    that blockchain can bring for the SCM professionals) encourages adoption. In our
    study, we adopt a comprehensive approach and use elements from all the above studies
    to build an extended list of blockchain adoption enablers in the supply chain.
    We then evaluate the levels of influence of these enablers and their interactions
    using DEMATEL methodology. Kamble et al. (2020) and Kouhizadeh et al. (2021) are
    the closest research papers to our work as they also use DEMATEL. However, multiple
    differences between this literature and our study do exist and allow us to add
    new results and insights to the extant literature. A fundamental difference that
    distinguishes our study from Kamble et al. (2020) is that our approach is not
    restrained to any particular sector while Kamble et al. (2020) is focused on blockchain
    adoption in agriculture supply chain. As for Kouhizadeh et al. (2021), our study
    is different from this paper from various perspectives, including the theoretical
    background, the scope, the methodology, the survey sample and the analysis. The
    theoretical background used in Kouhizadeh et al. (2021) is composed of force field
    theory and TOE framework, while we use the DOI theory combined with the Business
    Technology Adoption model developed in Iacovou et al. (1995). With regards to
    the scope, Kouhizadeh et al. (2021) studies the barriers to blockchain adoption
    and use the broader scope of sustainable supply chain management that encompasses
    economic, social and environmental aspects of supply chain management while we
    analyze enablers of adoption using the traditional approach to supply chain management
    which focuses mainly on the economic aspect of management. Though there exist
    some overlapping between the scopes of the two studies leading to similarities
    between some of the factors investigated, the lists of factors used in the two
    studies present much more differences than similarities. Differences are mainly
    due to the fact that we consider enablers and have a deep focus on the economic
    pillar of supply chain management while Kouhizadeh et al. (2021) consider barriers
    and widen the scope to integrate social and environmental pillars. From a methodology
    perspective, Kouhizadeh et al. (2021) proceed hierarchically by investigating
    the influences between categories of barriers and then between the barriers within
    each category. Contrasting with this hierarchical approach, we acquire the respondents’
    evaluations of direct mutual influences between all the enablers taken together.
    While each method has its advantages and limits, ours allows for capturing and
    analyzing the direct mutual influences among all the enablers. Lastly, our analysis
    is focused on getting insights from practitioners in different industries and
    sectors, while a major part of the work in Kouhizadeh et al. (2021) is dedicated
    to comparing results from academics with those obtained from practitioners. Given
    these differences with existing literature, our study adds new results and insights.
    3. Theoretical framework and enabling factors of blockchain technology adoption
    in the supply chain In this section, we present the theoretical framework for
    blockchain adoption in the supply chain. Then we use this framework to identify
    the adoption enablers based on an extensive review of the literature. 3.1. Theoretical
    framework The theoretical approach used in this study is based on two complementary
    theories on innovation and technology adoption. The first theory is the diffusion
    of innovation (DOI) (Rogers, 2010). DOI posits that adoption of any new technological
    innovation is largely determined by five attributes that are: the complexity of
    the innovation, its compatibility with the organization, the benefit or advantage
    that it offers compared to other existing technological choices, its observability
    and trialability. Two of these factors i.e., trialability and observability have
    often been dropped from IT innovation literature (Chong et al., 2009). This is
    because, by nature of organizational adoption of technology, these become top-down
    activity where the organization imposes the new IT innovation with limited trialability
    for its constituents. For the same reasons, observability of new IT innovation
    within the organization is also limited and hence the factor is not included in
    DOI-based models when analyzing IT innovations (Chong et al., 2009; Oliveira et
    al., 2014). While DOI focuses on the innovation''s characteristics responsible
    for adoption and diffusion of new technologies, it is widely recognized that IT
    adoption at the firm level is subject to organizational and external context-related
    factors(Oliveira and Martins, 2011). Hence, it is imperative to study organizational
    and context-related factors in any firm level technology adoption. Given these
    concerns with taking a single theoretic approach to study technology adoption
    and the limitations of DOI, researchers have argued for and utilized multi-theoretical
    approaches (Hong et al., 2021; Wamba et al., 2020). A theoretical framework like
    DOI needs to be supplemented with a more organization and external context specific
    framework to embrace the complete array of factors impacting the adoption. Iacovou,
    Benbassat and Dexter (1995) provide an appropriate lens to fulfill this purpose.
    Indeed, the framework in Iacovou et al. (1995) was developed to provide a deeper
    understanding of the way organizational, external and technology specific factors
    impact the adoption of technology by firms. It includes organizational factors
    related to the technological and financial readiness of the adopting organization
    along with external factors related to the organization''s environment, such as
    partners, regulations and competition. As such the model provides a perfect complementary
    view to the DOI framework to study various factors that have a role to play in
    technology adoption by organizations. Based on the above discussion, we argue
    that five groups of enablers that include three innovation characteristics (relative
    advantage, compatibility and complexity) in addition to organizational and external
    context-related factors shape the situation where a firm must make the decision
    to adopt blockchain technology in the supply chain, as shown in Fig. 1. In the
    following sub-sections, these five categories of enablers are further explained
    and the enablers that compose each one of them are identified based on an extensive
    review of the literature. Download : Download high-res image (187KB) Download

    3.1.1. Organizational readiness Organizational readiness refers to the organization''s
    financial and technological capacities that affect the implementation and use
    of the technology (Iacovou et al., 1995). Implementing blockchain technology requires
    investing in various kinds of software and hardware and using sophisticated information
    systems for collecting, storing and communicating data (Iansiti and Lakhani, 2017).
    Therefore, in our model of blockchain adoption in the supply chain, this dimension
    comprises factors that reflect the technological capabilities of the firm (Behnke
    and Janssen, 2020; Bumblauskas et al. 2019; Janssen et al., 2020); the knowledge
    and expertise in using the technology (Behnke and Janssen, 2020; Mendling et al.,
    2018; Wang et al., 2019; Janssen et al., 2020) and the availability of the financial
    resources required for implementing the technology (Wang et al., 2019; Janssen
    et al., 2020). Extant literature identifies top management commitment as being
    influential on the adoption of inter-organizational information systems (Gunasekaran
    and Ngai, 2008). Indeed, management commitment allows for devoting the necessary
    human and financial resources for implementing the technology and the organizational
    change (Saberi et al., 2019; Kouhizadeh et al., 2021; van Hoek, 2019). Thus, we
    posit management commitment as an enabler of blockchain adoption and map it to
    the organizational readiness dimension. 3.1.2. Relative advantage The relative
    advantage of an innovation can be defined by the increase in the economic benefit
    and the impact that the innovation brings compared to existing systems that it
    replaces (Rogers, 2010). Relative advantage is often found to be positively correlated
    with the adoption of innovations (Kapoor et al., 2014). It is also found to be
    an antecedent of technology adoption in the supply chain context (Brandon-Jones
    and Kauppi, 2018). Literature reports that, compared to other existing systems,
    blockchain technology better ensures data integrity (Casey and Wong, 2017; Babich
    and Hilary, 2020; Kouhizadeh and Sarkis, 2018; Montecchi et al., 2019), improve
    data availability from multiple sources and supply chain members (Casey and Wong,
    2017; Babich and Hilary, 2020; Kouhizadeh and Sarkis, 2018; van Hoek, 2019). In
    addition, it is widely admitted that using this technology reduces the cost of
    transactions between supply chain members (Kshetri, 2018; Schmidt and Wagner,
    2019; Tönnissen and Teuteberg, 2020; Wamba et al., 2020). Note that the transaction
    cost considered here is different from the concept of overall cost of ownership
    of blockchain. Indeed, while studies like Kshetri (2018), Schmidt and Wagner (2019),
    Tönnissen and Teuteberg (2020) and Wamba et al. (2020) point out the contribution
    of blockchain to lowering transaction cost, other works like Wang et al. (2019)
    and Janssen et al. (2020) insist on the challenging nature of blockchain implementation
    cost. To our knowledge, a thorough study of the overall cost-related impact of
    blockchain adoption (cost of implementation, the resulting reduction in transaction
    costs and the return on investment) doesn''t exist yet. This represents a critical
    gap in literature, where the cost-related implications of blockchain adoption
    in a supply chain need to be studied. In our study, we focus on the enablers of
    adoption. We thus include the capacity of blockchain to lower transaction cost
    in our list of enablers. We map the three enablers discussed above to the relative
    advantage dimension in our theoretical framework. 3.1.3. Compatibility The compatibility
    refers to the degree of consistency between the innovation and existing values,
    experience and needs of the organization (Rogers, 2010). Blockchain technology
    is typically used in supply chain management to create and share unique data records
    among trade partners to increase transparency and visibility of information through
    the whole supply chain (Casey and Wong, 2017; Babich and Hilary, 2020; Montecchi
    et al., 2019). Its implementation may require changing internal operational processes
    to maintain internal traceability and support the required level of details in
    data (Mendling et al., 2018; Tönnissen and Teuteberg, 2020). It also requires
    the willingness and capacity of supply chain members to share data and to cooperate
    for establishing common process standards, rules for information disclosure and
    related supply chain objectives. Therefore, we map to the compatibility dimension
    the enablers related to these aspects, which are: ease in implementing process
    and organizational changes to accommodate blockchain adoption and use (Mendling
    et al., 2018; Chang et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019; Janssen et al., 2020); availability
    of credible and accurate data from the internal processes (Behnke and Janssen,
    2020; Wang et al., 2019); cultural aspects related to the propensity for transparency
    among the supply chain members (Wang et al., 2019; Janssen et al., 2020; Kouhizadeh
    et al., 2021); cooperation between supply chain members to agree on common rules
    for data disclosure and confidentiality issues (Wang et al., 2019; Behnke and
    Janssen, 2020; Kouhizadeh et al., 2021); cooperation for process standardization
    and agreement between supply chain members on the type and level of details of
    the data to be shared on the blockchain (Casey and Wong, 2017; Bumblauskas et
    al. 2019; Wang et al., 2019; Behnke and Janssen, 2020; Janssen et al., 2020);
    cooperation between the supply chain members to adopt common objectives from using
    the technology (Babich and Hilary, 2020; Wang et al., 2019; Kouhizadeh et al.,
    2021). 3.1.4. Complexity Complexity indicates to which degree the innovation is
    perceived as being difficult to understand and use (Rogers, 2010). Blockchain
    is a disruptive and relatively complex technology (Crosby et al., 2016; Iansiti
    and Lakhani, 2017), and this may hurts its adoption. Thus, we map to this dimension
    factors in the literature that help in alleviating the effect of the complexity
    of the technology and act as enablers for its adoption and use for supply chain
    management. These factors are: developing and harmonizing blockchain technology
    standards (Lacity, 2018; Wang et al., 2019; Janssen et al., 2020); establishing
    appropriate and clear governance rules for blockchain platforms (Mendling et al.,
    2018; Wang et al., 2019; Janssen et al., 2020); establishing rules and standards
    for interoperability between blockchains and between blockchains and other systems
    (Mendling et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2019). 3.1.5. External pressure External
    pressure to adopt the innovation refers to the influences originating from the
    organization''s environment (Iacovou et al., 1995). Indeed, the influence exerted
    by external parties may be determinant in the adoption of inter-organizational
    information technologies (Teo et al., 2003). In our theoretical model for blockchain
    adoption within the context of supply chain management, this dimension comprises
    pressures that originate from the organization''s environment as well as encouraging
    factors in this environment. Building on this and on findings in the extant literature,
    we map the following enablers to the external pressure category: customer interest
    in the traceability information and other product-related data on the blockchain
    (Lacity, 2018; Kshetri, 2018; Montecchi et al., 2019; van Hoek, 2019); industry-wide
    initiatives to promote blockchain technology adoption and use (Casey and Wong,
    2017; Lacity, 2018; Behnke and Janssen, 2020); establishing regulatory framework
    for using blockchain technology (Casey and Wong, 2017; Lacity, 2018; Wang et al.,
    2019; Janssen et al., 2020); and government pressure for implementing blockchain
    technology (Lacity, 2018). 3.2. Enablers of blockchain adoption in the supply
    chain Table 1 summarizes the results of the literature review we conducted to
    identify the enablers of blockchain adoption in the supply chain. Information
    in Table 1 provides the answer to our research question RQ1 and informs our model
    for blockchain adoption in the supply chain by providing a list of enablers of
    adoption organized in five catagories as per the model in Fig. 1. Table 1. Enablers
    of blockchain technology adoption in the supply chain. Category Enabler Enabler
    Name Enabler Description References Organizational Readiness E1 Technological
    capabilities To implement and use blockchain technology a firm needs to use sophisticated
    information systems for collecting, storing and communicating data. Availability
    of such systems and capabilities encourages adoption. Iansiti and Lakhani (2017);
    Behnke and Janssen (2020); Bumblauskas et al. 2019; Janssen et al. (2020) E2 Knowledge
    and expertise in using the technology Implementing blockchain technology requires
    specific and new technical expertise. The availability of such expertise in the
    firm would thus encourage the implementation of the blockchain technology. Behnke
    and Janssen (2020); Mendling et al. (2018) E3 Availability of financial resources
    Blockchain adoption and implementation requires investing in sophisticated technology
    and the availability of sufficient financial resources encourages such investment.
    Wang et al. (2019); Janssen et al. (2020) E4 Management commitment Management
    commitment allows for devoting the necessary resources for implementing blockchain
    technology. Firm''s management also plays an important role in encouraging and
    accompanying the cultural and organizational changes that the implementation of
    the technology may require. Gunasekaran and Ngai (2008); Kouhizadeh et al., 2021;
    van Hoek, 2019 Relative Advantage E5 Integrity of data on the blockchain Blockchains
    are designed to guarantee that it is much difficult to erase or change already
    stored data. This may encourage adoption, as data is more secure and trustful.
    Casey and Wong (2017); Babich and Hilary (2020); Kouhizadeh and Sarkis (2018);
    Montecchi et al. (2019) E6 Improved data availability from multiple sources and
    supply chain members One of the main characteristics of blockchain technology
    is that it makes all the recorded data virtually continuously available for all
    the network participants. Casey and Wong (2017); Babich and Hilary (2020); van
    Hoek, 2019 E7 Lower transaction cost Blockchain allows for reducing the cost of
    transactions between supply chain members, especially due to disintermediation
    and the application of smart contracts. Kshetri (2018); Schmidt and Wagner, 2019;
    Tönnissen and Teuteberg (2020); Wamba et al. (2020) Compatibility E8 Ease in implementing
    process and organizational changes to accommodate blockchain adoption and use
    Implementing blockchain technology requires re-engineering of related processes
    to support availability of required data. Therefore, the ease in implementing
    organizational changes encourages the adoption of the technology. Mendling et
    al. (2018); Chang et al. (2019); Wang et al. (2019); Janssen et al. (2020) E9
    Availability of credible and accurate data from internal processes Using blockchain
    for sharing information among supply chain members requires accurate and credible
    data to be collected from their internal processes. Thus, the availability of
    such data enables the supply chain members to share it and may encourage the adoption
    of blockchain technology for this purpose. Mendling et al. (2018); Wang et al.
    (2019); Behnke and Janssen (2020); Janssen et al. (2020) E10 Cultural aspects
    related to the propensity for transparency among the supply chain members Using
    blockchain technology is usually intended to increase supply chain transparency.
    Thus, a culture of transparency among supply chain members encourages the adoption
    of this technology. Wang et al. (2019); Janssen et al. (2020); Kouhizadeh et al.,
    2021 E11 Cooperation between supply chain members to agree on common rules for
    data disclosure and confidentiality issues A data disclosure policy that identifies
    the data that will be shared between the supply chain members and the rules for
    accessing the data on the blockchain is a first step towards data disclosure and
    for making it available on the blockchain. Wang et al. (2019); Behnke and Janssen
    (2020); Kouhizadeh et al., 2021 E12 Cooperation between supply chain members for
    process standardization and agreement on the type and level of details of the
    data to be shared on the blockchain To share data on blockchain, supply chain
    members need to agree on standard processes, thee types, formats, and level of
    details of the data to be shared. Casey and Wong (2017); Bumblauskas et al. 2019;
    Wang et al. (2019); Behnke and Janssen (2020); Janssen et al., 2020 E13 Cooperation
    between supply chain members to adopt common supply chain objectives from using
    the technology Agreeing on common objectives from using blockchain technology
    among the supply chain members increases the chance of adoption and use of this
    technology by them. Babich and Hilary (2020); Wang et al. (2019); Kouhizadeh et
    al., 2021 Complexity E14 Developing and harmonizing blockchain technology standards
    Blockchain protocols are not stable yet. There is also a lack of standardization
    of the technology and the format of data and interfaces with other systems. Advances
    in this regard would encourage adoption. Lacity (2018); Wang et al., 2019; Janssen
    et al. (2020) E15 Establishing appropriate and clear governance rules for blockchain
    platforms To be trusted and to work efficiently, a blockchain should have an appropriate
    governance structure and clear rules for decision-making, and conflict resolution.
    Babich and Hilary (2020); Wang et al. (2019); Janssen et al. (2020) E16 Establishing
    rules and standards for interoperability between blockchains and between blockchains
    and other systems A company may be part of multiple blockchains. Thus, there is
    a need to know how these blockchains may interact with each other. Mendling et
    al. (2018); Wang et al., 2019 External Pressure E17 Customer interest in the traceability
    information and other product-related data on blockchain Interest of customers
    in traceability information and other data available on the blockchain would push
    firms and supply chains to adopt this technology for supply chain management to
    ensure data availability for customers. Lacity (2018); Kshetri (2018); Montecchi
    et al., 2019; van Hoek, 2019 E18 Industry wide initiatives to promote blockchain
    technology adoption and use Adoption of blockchain technology may be encouraged
    by initiatives to promote adoption that are taken on the level of the entire industry.
    Casey and Wong (2017); Lacity (2018); Behnke and Janssen (2020) E19 Establishing
    regulatory framework for using blockchain technology Establishing new regulations
    that are adapted to blockchain-enabled transactions may encourage adoption, as
    the current regulatory framework doesn''t not cover the transactions and the new
    business models made possible by blockchain technology. Casey and Wong (2017);
    Mendling et al. (2018); Lacity (2018); Wang et al. (2019); Janssen et al. (2020)
    E20 government pressure for implementing blockchain technology Government could
    adopt regulations to mandate the implementation and use of blockchain technology,
    for traceability and authentication purposes in some sectors, such as in pharmaceutical
    production. Lacity (2018) 4. Research method To evaluate the levels of influence
    of the enablers identified in Section 3 and analyze their relationships, we use
    the DEMATEL method. DEMATEL is a decision-making support tool that helps in acquiring
    the input of experts regarding complex problems, and appropriately using this
    information to improve our understanding of such problems. This tool is particularly
    adapted for studying problems in which multiple intricate factors mutually influence
    each other and contribute together to forming an overall situation (Gabus and
    Fontela, 1973). It helps in evaluating the relative importance or impact of the
    factors under consideration and establishing causal relationships between them.
    DEMATEL has been widely used for studying a variety of supply chain management-related
    topics, such as analyzing and modeling sustainability practices in supply chains
    (Gandhi et al., 2015; Govindan et al., 2011; Kaur et al.2017; Lin, 2013); modeling
    supplier selection criteria (Chang et al., 2011); analyzing enablers of supply
    chain risk mitigation (Rajesh and Ravi, 2015); and analyzing traceability implementation
    (Haleem et al., 2019). 4.1. Steps for applying DEMATEL As previously mentioned,
    DEMATEL is based on experts’ input regarding the interaction between factors related
    to a given problem (Li and Mathiyazhagan, 2018; Bai et al., 2017). Once the factors
    to be studied are identified, DEMATEL is implemented as follows. Step 1: Acquiring
    the evaluation of the factors from a panel of experts. The first step in implementing
    DEMATEL is to collect data from experts on how they think the different factors
    impact each other. For this purpose, experts are asked to make pairwise evaluations
    of the impact of factors on each other. Let be the number of factors under consideration,
    a matrix of size is formed with all these factors in the lines and in the columns.
    The experts are then asked to fill in the cells of this matrix with their evaluation
    of the influence of each factor in the lines on the different factors in the columns.
    Let be the number of experts participating to the study. Each expert (with ) will
    return a matrix that contains his evaluation ( ) regarding the influence of each
    factor ) in the lines on each factor ( ) in the columns. Note that the size of
    the matrix is , as the same factors are reported in the lines and in the columns
    of the matrix. As for the evaluations , they take numerical values that represent
    the expert''s evaluation of the influence between factors. The values on the diagonal
    of any matrix are, of course, set to zero (i. e., ) as a factor could not influence
    itself. Step 2: Computing the direct relation matrix (B). Using the output from
    Step 1, one single direct relation matrix is computed by aggregating the matrices
    using the formula in Equation (1). (1) Step 3: Computing the normalized direct
    relation matrix. In this step, the direct relation matrix is normalized as follows.
    The sum of elements in each line of the matrix is computed and the maximum sum
    ( ) is selected as in Equation (2). (2) Then, the normalized direct relation matrix
    is computed as in Equation (3). (3) Step 4: Computing the total relation matrix
    (T). The total relation matrix ( ) is computed using the normalized direct relation
    matrix as in Equation (4). (4) Step 5: Computing the total influence between factors.
    The total influence a factor (i) exerts on the other factors is computed by taking
    the sum of the elements in the corresponding row ( ) in the total relation matrix
    (T), as in Equation (5). As for the influence that a factor (j) receives from
    the other factors in the system, it is equal to the sum of the elements in the
    corresponding column ( ) in the same matrix (T). Equations (5), (6)), show how
    these two elements are computed. (5) (6) Step 6: Computing the prominence ( )
    and the net effect ( ) of the factors. Then, for each factor ( ) the overall importance
    (prominence) ( ) and the net effect ( ) are computed using the expressions in
    (7), (8). (7) (8) The prominence ( ) of a factor ( ) represents the sum of the
    influence that this factor exerts on and receives from the other factors in the
    system. The net effect ( ) of a factor ( ) represents the difference between the
    influence that this factor exerts on the other factors and the influence of the
    other factors of the system on it. At this stage, all the information regarding
    the influence of the factors is obtained and can be illustrated using diagrams
    and graphics. But a further step that allows for focusing on the significant relationships
    between the factors could be performed by discarding all the values in the matrix
    (T) that are lower than a threshold ( ). Notice that choosing a small value of
    the threshold leads to discarding very few relationships and results in complex
    diagrams between factors due to the high number of direct relations considered.
    On the other hand, a high value of the threshold ( ) could lead to discarding
    too many relations that could be interesting to consider. Given the high number
    of factors we deal with in this study, we choose to use a threshold value that
    exceeds the average of the elements in the total relation matrix (T) by one standard
    deviation. Thus, ( ) is calculated using the expression (9). (9) 4.2. Sampling
    respondents and collecting data We targeted a sample of 160 potential respondents
    who have sufficient expertise in supply chain management or information technology
    applications in supply chains. Following similar studies which are based on experts''
    opinion such as Agi and Nishant (2017), Bokrantz et al. (2017) and Wang et al.
    (2019), we used two main criteria to select potential respondents: (1) the number
    of years of experience within the field and (2) the position in the company. Thus,
    all the members of our targeted sample have at least 5 years of work experience
    in functions related to supply chain management or information technology management
    with direct linkages to supply chain processes. All the experts in our panel work
    in middle or higher management positions in their respective companies, or as
    confirmed or senior consultants. We built the targeted sample using our network
    and asked for help from the Brittany Chamber of Commerce (CCI-Bretagne), France
    to identify potential respondents. Given the emerging nature of blockchain technology
    applications in supply chain management, the respondents didn''t need to be experts
    in blockchain technology. However, in the e-mail we sent to them to ask if they
    are willing to take part to the study, they were informed that they should be
    aware of blockchain technology attributes and its current and potential use in
    supply chain management in order to fill in the questionnaire. Finally, as our
    study is not restricted to a specific sector, targeted respondents came from companies
    operating in a variety of sectors including manufacturing, distribution, service,
    and consulting. We followed a two-step process in collecting answers from respondents,
    as explained in Appendix I. In a first step, we sent e-mails to all the 160 potential
    respondents to give them a full explanation of the objective of the study and
    ask if they are willing to contribute by filling the matrix of mutual influence
    between the 20 factors. Then, an Excel file representing the evaluation matrix
    with the 20 enablers in the rows and the columns, and the evaluation grid (Table
    2) were sent to the 52 respondents who declared their willingness to take part
    to the study. Data collection took place from mid-January to mid-March 2021. In
    a limited number of cases, we had to call the respondents and give explanations
    on the way they should proceed for filling in the Excel sheet. The use of the
    Excel sheet in collecting answers helped to limit the typing errors, as the data
    was ready to be exploited directly in Excel. Out of the 52 respondents who initially
    accepted to fill in the matrix, 37 returned useable responses in which answers
    to all the questions are obtained and the Excel file is entirely completed. Table

    3, we notice that out of the 37 respondents, 16 work in supply chain management

    out of 37) have more than 10 years of work experience in the field of the study.

    for two reasons. First, the respondents are individuals with significant information
    about the phenomenon under investigation in addition to being experts in the field
    (Bai et al., 2017; Li and Mathiyazhagan, 2018). Hence, even a low number of respondents
    could provide detailed insights into the phenomenon being studied. Secondly, the
    method relies on the respondents’ critical evaluation of theoretically chosen
    factors to help the researchers establish the relative importance and mutual dependence
    of these factors. As such a small sample size is expected to help the research
    reach a level of theoretical saturation (Kamble et al., 2020; Li et al., 2018).
    It needs to be established that the generalizations that are drawn from the result
    trace themselves as much to the theory being established as to the empirical data.
    Hence, we are claiming theoretical generalization as against statistical generalization
    of the results (Jha et al., 2016). Theoretically generalized results are considered
    to be robust due to their grounding in critically evaluated theoretical paradigms
    and utilized widely in circumstances where limited access to data prohibits statistical
    generalization (Maxwell and Chmiel, 2014). 5. Analysis and results Our analysis
    started by applying Equation (1) to compute the direct relationship matrix based
    on the 37 useable responses returned by the experts. Then, we computed the normalized
    direct relation matrix (B) using Equations (2), (3)). The total relation matrix
    (T) is then computed using Equation (4). This matrix is presented in Appendix
    II. The total influence an enabler ( ) exerts on and receives from the other enablers
    in the system, respectively ( ) and ( ), are computed using Equations (5), (6).
    Then, the levels of importance (prominence) (R + C) and the net effect (R–C) of
    the enablers are computed by applying Equations (7), (8). Results obtained from
    this step are shown in Table 4. Based on information in Table 4, we order the
    20 enablers according to their prominence scores and graphically depict these
    scores in Fig. 2. Table 4. Prominence and net effect of the enablers. Category

    image Fig. 2. Prominence levels of the enablers. Note that the prominence of an
    enabler indicates its overall importance in the system (Bai et al., 2017; Govindan
    et al., 2015). Thus, information in Table 4 and Fig. 2 answers the second research
    question in this study (RQ2) by providing an evaluation of the level of importance
    of the various enablers with regards to the adoption decision. From Table 4 and
    Fig. 2, we notice that lowering transaction cost (E7) is the most prominent enabler,
    followed by customer interest in the traceability information and other product-related
    data on blockchain (E17), management commitment (E4), establishing regulatory
    framework for using blockchain technology (E19) and cooperation between supply
    chain members for process standardization and agreement on the type and level
    of details of the data to be shared on the blockchain (E12), respectively. On
    the other hand, enablers that have the lowest prominence scores are the availability
    of financial resources (E3), Ease in implementing process and organizational changes
    (E8), the government pressure (E20), the Technological capabilities (E1) and the
    knowledge and expertise in using the technology (E2). While the prominence score
    indicates the overall importance of an enabler, the net effect informs us if this
    enabler should be categorized as a cause or as an effect enabler. Cause enablers
    have positive net effect scores, which indicate that they exert more impact on
    the other enablers in the system than they are impacted by them. Therefore, these
    enablers may be addressed relatively independently of the situation of the other
    enablers, and potentially benefit the whole system. By contrast, effect enablers
    are those enablers with negative net effect scores, indicating that they are more
    impacted by the other enablers of the system than they exert impact on them. Fig.
    3 position the 20 enablers of blockchain adoption under investigation relative
    to the two dimensions: prominence and net effect. The vertical axis in Fig. 3
    represents the prominence. It is graduated from 0.6 to 3.0 to accommodate the
    values that we had in our analysis. The horizontal axis represents the net effect,
    and it ranges from −1.4 to +1.4 with negative and positive values indicating effect
    and cause enablers, respectively. Download : Download high-res image (244KB) Download

    4 and Fig. 3, we notice that half of the 20 enablers of blockchain adoption considered
    in our study are cause enablers and half of them are effect enablers. We also
    notice that among the five most prominent enablers, customer interest in the traceability
    information and other product-related data on blockchain (E17) and establishing
    regulatory framework for using blockchain technology (E19) are cause enablers,
    while lower transaction cost (E7), management commitment (E4), and cooperation
    between supply chain members for process standardization and agreement on the
    type and level of details of the data to be shared on the blockchain (E12) are
    effect ones. 6. Discussion and implications In this section, we further analyze
    and discuss the results obtained in the previous section (Section 5). We do this
    first by considering the prominence of the enablers by category of enablers as
    per the theoretical model presented in Section 3. Then, we focus on the most eminent
    enablers and analyze their relationships and interactions with the rest of the
    system. Subsequently, we use the result of our analysis to elaborate implications
    and managerial insights. 6.1. Prominence by category of enablers Taking a categorical
    construct level view of the enablers, Table 5 shows the average prominence scores
    computed for each category of enablers that compose the theoretical model described
    in Section 3. Categories in this table are ordered according to the average prominence
    of the enablers that compose them. Table 5. Prominence and net effect of the categories
    of enablers. Category Average Prominence Relative Advantage 2.231 External Pressure
    2.080 Compatibility 2.018 Complexity 1.853 Organizational Readiness 1.481 From
    Table 5, we notice that relative advantage and external pressure have the highest
    average prominence values, respectively, while organizational readiness has the
    lowest average prominence value. Thus, blockchain adoption in the supply chain
    is mainly influenced by the benefits (relative advantage) that this technology
    offers in comparison with other existing technologies (integrity of data, improved
    data availability and lower transaction costs), followed by the external pressure
    for adoption exerted by customers and public authorities, in particular. To the
    opposite, organizational readiness seems to have a limited impact on the adoption
    decision. This last result suggests that adoption decision may be taken regardless
    of the organizational readiness, so that blockchain would often be the driver
    of wider organizational transformation. This result finds support in the extant
    literature of digital transformation that states that organizational digitalization
    would be a result of major technological adoption (Andriole et al., 2017; Hartley
    and Sawaya, 2019). 6.2. Prominence and relationships between enablers Lower transaction
    cost (E7), customer interest in the traceability information and other product-related
    data on blockchain (E17), management commitment (E4), establishing regulatory
    framework for using blockchain technology (E19) and cooperation between supply
    chain members for process standardization and agreement on the type and level
    of details of the data to be shared on the blockchain (E12) are top five prominent
    enablers of blockchain adoption in the supply chain, as evidenced in Table 4.
    A careful look in the total relation matrix (T) enables a full understanding of
    the impact of these enablers by uncovering their interactions with the rest of
    the system. However, due to the big number of enablers investigated in this study,
    we analyze relationships and interactions among them and answer the third research
    question of the study (RQ3) by focusing on the meaningful relationships in the
    total relation matrix (T). To do this, we apply a threshold so that only the values
    in the total relation matrix (T) that are higher than the threshold would be considered.
    Applying a threshold and focusing on the most significant relationships among
    factors is a common practice in DEMATEL studies (Kouhizadeh et al., 2021; Fu et
    al., 2012). Table 6 shows the remaining values from the total relation matrix
    (T) after applying the threshold defined in Equation (9). Table 6. The most significant
    relation coefficients between enablers. Empty Cell Impacted enablers E4 E6 E7

    Data in Table 6 shows that the capacity of blockchain to lower transaction cost
    that represent the most eminent enabler (E7) is significantly impacted by a number
    of enablers including the existence of a regulatory framework (E19), standards
    for interoperability (E16) and appropriate and clear governance rules for blockchain
    (E15), in addition to the integrity of data on the blockchain (E5). This suggests
    that supply chain professionals believe that grasping the benefit of lower transaction
    const due to blockchain adoption in the supply chain is subject to the establishment
    of appropriate conditions for using the technology: an appropriate regulatory
    framework, operability standards and governance rules. In its turn, E7 seems to
    significantly enhance the management commitment (F4) and promote the availability
    of credible and accurate data from internal processes (E9). As for the second
    most prominent enabler: customer interest in the traceability information and
    other product-related data on blockchain (E17), data in Table 6 shows that this
    enabler exerts a significant impact on management commitment (E4), data availability
    from internal firm''s processes (E9) as well as from all the participants in the
    blockchain (E6). It also appears that E17 triggers four cooperation-related enablers
    at the supply chain level. These are cooperation between supply chain members
    to agree on: common rules for data disclosure and confidentiality issues (E11),
    process standardization and the type and level of details of the data to be shared
    on the blockchain (E12), common supply chain objectives from using the technology
    (E13) in addition to establishing appropriate and clear governance rules for blockchain
    platforms (E15). The high-level impact of E17 on multiple other enablers as demonstrated
    above suggests that a big portion of the motivation for adopting blockchain technology
    in the supply chain is related to customers'' requirements regarding traceability
    and other product-related data. Management commitment (E4) is identified as the
    third most prominent enabler for blockchain adoption in the supply chain. In-depth
    examination of the role of this enabler using information in Table 6 shows that
    management commitment acts as a bearing point in the system. It appears as an
    effect enabler leveraged, mainly, by the integrity of data on blockchain (E5),
    the potential for lowering transaction cost (E7), The cultural propensity for
    transparency (E10), the existence of rules for interoperability (E16), the customer
    interest in the information on blockchain (E17), and the existence of a regulatory
    framework for using blockchain technology (F19). On its turn, management commitment
    significantly contributes to enhancing the availability of credible and accurate
    data from internal processes (E9) and the cooperation between supply chain members
    to agree on common rules for data disclosure and confidentiality issues (E11),
    process standardization, type and level of details of the data to be shared on
    the blockchain (E12), and common supply chain objectives from using the technology
    (E13). Our results also show that establishing regulatory framework for using
    blockchain technology (E19) is an important cause enabler ranked fourth in prominence.
    It significantly enhances management commitment (E4), the availability of data
    from firm''s internal processes (E9) and from various other sources and supply
    chain members (E6), in addition to supporting reduction of transaction costs (E7).
    E19 also provides a favorable legal environment for cooperation between supply
    chain members to agree on common objectives, rules and standards related to sharing
    data on blockchain, as demonstrated by the significant effect of this enabler
    on E11, E12, E13 and E15. Like management commitment at the firm''s level, cooperation
    at the supply chain level seems to be very important for blockchain adoption.
    This is highlighted by the ranking of the cooperation between supply chain members
    for process standardization and agreement on the type and level of details of
    the data to be shared on the blockchain (E12), ranked fifth in prominence. Data
    in Table 6 shows that this enabler is significantly impacted by customer interest
    in product traceability (E17), the cultural propensity for transparency in the
    supply chain (E10), the establishment of regulatory framework for using blockchain
    technology (E19), the existence of rules for interoperability (E16) and the integrity
    of data on blockchain (E5). Data in Table 6 also shows that the two other enablers
    related to the cooperation between supply chain members (E11) and (E13) are also
    significantly impacted by the same enablers as (E12). Thus, our findings suggest
    that having supply chain members cooperating for adopting blockchain in the supply
    chain is subject to the customer interest in product traceability, the cultural
    propensity for transparency in the supply chain, the existence of regulatory framework
    for using blockchain technology and the existence of rules for interoperability.
    6.3. Implications and managerial insights Our results demonstrate that firm''s
    management commitment and cooperation between supply chain partners on various
    aspects related to data sharing, confidentiality and system governance are both
    of primary importance for adopting blockchain technology in the supply chain.
    Findings also reveal that management commitment and cooperation between supply
    chain members for blockchain adoption are mainly triggered and supported by factors
    that may be addressed by extending efforts in three main directions. First, for
    raising awareness among consumers and firms'' managers about the usefulness of
    the availability of product data and the capability of blockchain to provide such
    data availability. Second, for developing and harmonizing the technology standards,
    in addition to enhancing blockchain interoperability. Third, for preparing a regulatory
    environment that favors the adoption and use of the technology. Consumers are
    a primary source of pressure on firms. Our findings show that consumer interest
    in product-related data, including traceability, encourages firms’ managers to
    adopt the blockchain technology and enhances collaboration among supply chain
    partners for data sharing on blockchain. This enabler may be addressed by conducting
    awareness campaigns to sensitize consumers on the usefulness of data that may
    be provided using blockchain. Such awareness campaigns may be conducted by consumers
    associations, NGOs or industry representative bodies. It may concern a wide range
    of data related to products as well as production and supply chain processes.
    For instance, consumers'' awareness about sustainability aspects in production
    motivates them to put more pressure for getting detailed and accurate information
    from all supply chain members regarding the social and environmental practices.
    Similarly, campaigns against fraud and counterfeit products in fashion and luxury
    industries encourage consumers to be more demanding for extensive and tamper-proof
    product information. In addition to consumers, awareness campaigns may also target
    firms upper and middle management to demonstrate the various advantages of blockchain
    in comparison with other technologies, especially its potential to lower the cost
    of transactions, which appears to be an impactful enabler of blockchain adoption
    in the supply chain. Actions of industry representative bodies, consulting firms
    and technology solutions promotors are crucial in this regard. Concretely, they
    may organize seminars, meetings, and workshops where new blockchain-enabled business
    models can be discussed and the value proposition of the technology as a platform
    for sharing tamper-proof information and reducing the costs of transactions can
    be demonstrated and clarified for managers. Consortiums or industry representative
    bodies may also conduct, or offer support to, blockchain applications proof of
    concept (Lacity, 2018), which may give confidence in the new technology and constitute
    a first step towards implementing real solutions. Companies may also conduct industry
    specific collective initiatives to develop and agree on the best practices and
    governance structure for blockchain technology (Casey and Wong, 2017; Behnke and
    Janssen, 2020). Our results also point out the importance of developing universal
    standards for blockchain technology, improving the interoperability between different
    blockchains and with firms'' information systems and establishing appropriate
    and clear governance rules. Thus, solutions providers need to work on adopting
    universal standards for this technology (Janssen et al., 2020) and enhancing interoperability
    between different blockchains, as well as between blockchain and firms'' information
    systems (Wang et al., 2019). Solutions providers may also work with legislators
    and user communities to build appropriate governance structures that define the
    rights and obligations of the different parties involved in blockchain management
    and use and determine the decision-making rules and the procedures for preventing
    information misuse and solving conflicts (Babich and Hilary, 2020). Finally, results
    demonstrate that establishing regulatory framework for using blockchain technology
    is critical with regard to adoption. This suggests that legislators are also required
    to put efforts to create new regulations or adapt the existing ones to support
    blockchain-enabled business models and exchange processes. Indeed, it is widely
    admitted that regulations related to data security and privacy impact the blockchain
    potential use (Lacity, 2018; Wang et al., 2019) and making new regulations or
    changing existing ones may be necessary to support the adoption of this technology.
    7. Limitations and conclusion The limitations to our study are mainly related
    to the respondents'' sample. Our respondents come exclusively from France. This
    may introduce a bias in the results. Future research work may thus be conducted
    in another country, a developing economy for example. Results may then be compared
    with ours for further insights. Special consideration may be given to factors
    like government pressure in these circumstances as presence (or absence) of legislative
    frameworks can alter the scope and possibility of blockchain adoption significantly
    in different geographies. As previously indicated, the transaction cost considered
    in our study refers to the cost of individual transactions. This cost is thus
    different from the overall cost of ownership that should also include the implementation
    cost. Future research may address this issue. Additionally, adopting a theory-driven
    approach, we have focused on identifying a comprehensive list of enablers and
    their inter-relationships as identified from the established theoretical literature.
    Given the emergent nature of technology, a grounded theoretic approach has the
    potential to bring to light new factors that could be explored in subsequent studies.
    However, within its limitations, this study makes a significant contribution to
    extant literature on blockchain adoption in the supply chain. Indeed, our work
    is one of the first empirical studies that attempt to analyze and understand blockchain
    adoption in the supply chain. The findings allowed to uncover the role of 20 enablers
    of blockchain adoption in the supply chain with regard to the adoption decision
    and to establish a series of insights on how to encourage such decision. We found
    that external pressure and relative advantage are the two most prominent categories
    of enablers that impact blockchain adoption in the supply chain. Findings also
    suggest that raising awareness among customers and supply chain professionals
    about the advantages of blockchain over existing technologies is key for stimulating
    its adoption. Our study also reveals that to motivate blockchain adoption in supply
    chains, it is crucial to develop technology standards, provide interoperability
    among different blockchains or between blockchains and firms’ systems, and adapt
    laws and regulations to support blockchain-enabled business models and exchange
    processes. Appendix I. Description of the survey procedure and the questionnaire
    Potential respondents were first approached by e-mail. In a first e-mail, we gave
    potential respondents an explanation of the survey objectives and asked them if
    they were willing to take part to it. The questionnaire was then sent by e-mail
    only to those respondents who accepted to take part to the survey. This second
    e-mail contained a breif reminder of the objectives of the study and two attached
    files: a Word file with the questions and an Excel file that contained the direct
    relation matrix that the respondent should fill in. The questionnaire in the Word
    file was organized in two parts as follows: Part 1 This part contained questions
    with the objective of acquiring the following information: - The size of the company.
    - The sector in which the company is operating. - The department the respondent
    works in. - The position of the respondent in the company. - The number of years
    of experience of the respondent in the current function. - The total number of
    years of experience the respondent has in supply chain or IT related activities.
    Part 2 This part contained one single question with the objective of acquiring
    the respondent''s evaluation of the interdependencies among the twenty enablers.
    The respondent was asked to fill in each cell of the matrix in the Excel file
    by one of the following numbers: 0 if he thinks that there is no impact of the
    factor in the line on the factor in the column of the cell 1 if he thinks that
    there is a low impact of the factor in the line on the factor in the column of
    the cell 2 if he thinks that there is a moderate impact of the factor in the line
    on the factor in the column of the cell 3 if he thinks that there is a high impact
    of the factor in the line on the factor in the column of the cell 4 if he thinks
    that there is a Very High impact of the factor in the line on the factor in the
    column of the cell NB1: The list of the 20 enablers and their definitions were
    supplied in an appendix to the questionnaire. NB2: As one factor could not impact
    itself, we already put “0” in the diagonal. NB3: The Excel file contained a 20
    × 20 with all the enablers listed in the columns and in the lines. To avoid confusion
    and filling errors, A note was incorporated in each cell in the table to indicate
    what the cell should contain. The note gave the full names of the impacting enabler
    in the line of the cell and the impacted enabler in the column. NB4: Analysis
    considered only responses in which answers to all the questions are obtained and
    the Excel file is entirely completed. Appendix II. Total Relation Matrix Empty

  explanation: This paper proposes a novel architecture for an IoT-based end-to-end
    automated irrigation management system. The system integrates sensors, actuators,
    and a cloud-based platform to collect data, monitor crop water requirements, and
    automate irrigation decisions. The key features of the system are its low cost,
    ease of implementation, and ability to be remotely monitored and controlled.
  extract_1: '"One of the key challenges in implementing automated irrigation systems
    is the need to integrate different technologies and data sources, ensuring seamless
    communication and interoperability. Our proposed architecture addresses this challenge
    by utilizing a cloud-based platform that enables the integration of sensors, actuators,
    and other devices. This cloud-based platform provides a centralized hub for data
    collection, processing, and decision-making, ensuring the smooth flow of information
    throughout the system."'
  extract_2: Furthermore, the integration of blockchain technology in our proposed
    architecture plays a crucial role in enhancing the security and reliability of
    the system. Blockchain technology provides a tamper-proof and distributed ledger
    system that ensures the integrity and traceability of data. This is particularly
    important in the context of automated irrigation management, as it ensures that
    the data used to make irrigation decisions is accurate and reliable.

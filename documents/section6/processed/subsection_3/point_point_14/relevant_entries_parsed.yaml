- explanation: This research is an empirical study based on case studies into the
    adoption of IoT by organizations, with specific attention paid to the benefits
    and risks of IoT adoption in asset management organizations. The research was
    conducted between 2015 and 2017 and involved interviews and group discussions
    with personnel from two distinct cases within the public works and infrastructure
    sector in the Netherlands. The full text of the research paper can be found at
    https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2019.05.008.
  extract_1: This paper analyzes IoT adoption by organizations, and identifies IoT
    benefits and risks. A Big, Open, Linked Data (BOLD) categorization of the expected
    benefits and risks of IoT is made by conducting a comprehensive literature study.
    In-depth case studies in the field of asset management with regards to large scale,
    physical infrastructure in the Netherlands were then executed to examine the actual
    experienced, real world benefits and risks. The duality of technology is used
    as our theoretical lens to determine relationships and reactions during the adoption
    process. The main research question is motivated by the lack of research on the
    analysis of IoT adoption in organizations, with specific regards to the limited
    understanding of the benefits and risks of IoT adoption in organizations, and
    asks how IoT adoption may impact organizations?
  extract_2: 'We broke the main research question up into four sub-questions, namely:

    1 What are the benefits of IoT for organizations?

    2 What are the risks of IoT for organizations?

    3 What are the organizational conditions of IoT adoption?

    4 What are the organizational consequences of IoT adoption?'
  limitations: The research has several limitations. First, the number of cases is
    limited to two. While this allowed for in-depth analysis, the results may not
    be generalizable to other domains or sectors. Second, the research only focused
    on the adoption of IoT in public sector organizations, and it is not clear whether
    the results are transferable to private sector organizations. Third, the research
    did not consider the long-term effects of IoT adoption, and it is possible that
    some of the benefits and risks identified in this study may only become apparent
    over time.

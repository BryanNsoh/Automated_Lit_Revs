    growing support for the adoption of electronic health records (EHR) to improve
    U.S. healthcare delivery, EHR adoption in the United States is slow to date due
    to a fundamental failure of the healthcare information technology marketplace.
    Reasons for the slow adoption of healthcare information technology include a misalignment
    of incentives, limited purchasing power among providers, variability in the viability
    of EHR products and companies, and limited demonstrated value of EHRs in practice.
    At the 2004 American College of Medical Informatics (ACMI) Retreat, attendees
    discussed the current state of EHR adoption in this country and identified steps
    that could be taken to stimulate adoption. In this paper, based upon the ACMI
    retreat, and building upon the experiences of the authors developing EHR in academic
    and commercial settings we identify a set of recommendations to stimulate adoption
    of EHR, including financial incentives, promotion of EHR standards, enabling policy,
    and educational, marketing, and supporting activities for both the provider community
    and healthcare consumers. Issue Section: Focus on Electronic Health Records: ACMI
    Symposium 2004 Viewpoint Paper The annual meeting of the American College of Medical
    Informatics (ACMI) in February 2004 focused on the status of electronic health
    records in the United States. Attendees at the meeting discussed three questions
    regarding the state of electronic health record (EHR) adoption in this country:
    Where have we come from? Where are we today and why? And with widespread adoption
    of EHR in the United States in mind—How do we get there from here? These discussions
    have been synthesized into three companion reports addressing each question in
    turn.1,2 In this report, building on the first two, we review discussions and
    recommendations that focus on the third question. This report represents the opinions
    of the authors, informed by the ACMI discussions, and does not represent a consensus
    statement from ACMI. We believe that U.S. health care information technology adoption
    is stymied by a fundamental health care information technology* (HIT) market failure.
    The HIT market has failed because of misaligned incentives (asymmetric risk and
    reward) among key market players, the inability to achieve broad standards adoption
    and lack of definition of basic product features, and the rapid cycle turnover
    of HIT companies to date. We identify four broad areas for action to stimulate
    U.S. EHR adoption. They are: (1) financial incentives to stimulate the EHR marketplace,
    (2) EHR functional and related informatics standards setting and adoption, (3)
    enabling policy for EHR adoption, and (4) educational, marketing, and supporting
    activities. Before we discuss each of these areas in turn, we start by first assessing
    the current market and business case for HIT in the United States. Addressing
    a U.S. Health Care Information Technology Market Failure We believe four principal
    reasons explain the U.S. HIT market failure. These issues must be overcome to
    facilitate rapid EHR adoption in this country. HIT Value Proposition While a great
    deal of work has been done demonstrating the impact of clinical information systems
    on clinical decision making and the quality of care, little work has been done
    that demonstrates the impact of health care information technology on economic
    outcomes. Several studies3,4,5,6,7 suggest that there should be a positive long-term
    return on investment for EHR in the ambulatory care environment and a business
    case for standardized interoperability between EHR implementations,8 but there
    is limited solid evidence demonstrating significantly improved financial outcomes
    resulting from HIT investments. In the absence of solid economic evidence for
    EHR adoption, most technology vendors make a business case focused on reduced
    costs associated with information management, potential quality of care impact,
    and, to a lesser degree, care process efficiency. For health care providers who
    heretofore have borne little risk for the quality of care provided, and who from
    their perspective are managing clinical practice well with a paper-based medical
    record, such arguments have largely fallen on deaf ears, perhaps appropriately
    so. We believe that the research agenda should focus on the value proposition
    of EHR across the health care delivery spectrum. Solid evidence of economic impact
    of EHR will help make the business case for EHR and drive adoption. Misaligned
    Incentives In addition to the absence of solid evidence on the economic impact
    of EHR, certain analyses suggest that the HIT market is failing due to a fundamental
    misalignment of incentives between providers purchasing HIT and those who fund
    health care, such as public and private payers and employers.1 The economic analysis
    suggests that the benefits of HIT do not accrue to those who must invest in these
    technologies. For example, many of the patient safety and quality effects of EHRs
    accrue benefit to the payer or employer–purchaser of health care services who
    is at greater risk for a patient''s total health care costs given decreasing rates
    of provider reimbursement under capitation. Under fee-for-service reimbursement
    models, providers have little incentive to use EHRs unless they can contribute
    enough to practice efficiency or revenue cycle management to improve net revenue
    per time unit. Under mixed reimbursement models such as variable withholds, and
    newer pay-for-performance programs, EHRs may contribute to achieving performance
    or quality benchmarks that warrant increased reimbursement or increased return
    of withhold payments. We identify recommendations that may stimulate EHR adoption
    through reimbursement reform and improved capital availability for the provider
    sector. Standards Adoption Another component of the market failure we identify
    is delayed standards adoption. In the absence of a clear business case or value
    proposition, it is not surprising that voluntary U.S. standards-setting efforts
    have made slow progress in stimulating adoption of standards addressing HIT functionality,
    interoperability, content representation, and messaging. With the exception of
    recent U.S. federal efforts at standards acceleration and identification and endorsement
    of a select set of standards for use in federal programs,9 progress has been slow
    in the private sector among HIT vendor companies, with the notable exception of
    the recent effort of the Markle Foundation and the Connecting for Health Program10
    and the Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise (IHE) efforts.11 The absence of
    a solid business case for interoperability allows vendors to take a myopic view
    of the use of standards in their products and in installations of their technology
    in customer environments. Few HIT customers currently propose information exchange
    with clinical business partners as a requirement for their clinical systems. Commonly
    today, only messaging standards are applied to ensure information exchange between
    disparate systems within the context of a single health care entity, whether group
    practice, hospital, or multi-facility integrated delivery network (IDN). Recent
    research suggests there is a considerable societal benefit—a U.S. savings potential
    of $78 billion annually—that could be achieved with seamless, fully interoperable
    health care information exchange among key stakeholders in the health care delivery
    system.2 At the local level, however, currently there is no financial reward for
    improved clinical information exchange among health care entities that regularly
    act as business partners providing care to a common set of patients—providers
    are not reimbursed for electronic information exchange. In one case of federally
    mandated interoperability standards, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
    Act (HIPAA) engendered cooperation among a set of diverse and potentially competing
    entities to improve reimbursement transactions and administrative information
    exchange12 through collaboration to identify and implement a shared methodology
    for administrative transaction management. This idiosyncratic approach, however,
    is unlikely to lead to a coordinated set of standards adopted across the country.
    In the current marketplace, in the absence of a similar shared and realizable
    gain for clinical information exchange, or other recognition of the value of collaboration,
    there is no incentive from the individual provider''s perspective for the adoption
    and use of a common set of interoperability standards. Viewed from another perspective,
    by distributing the costs of poor information exchange and interoperability far
    and wide across all participants in the health care delivery system, each individual
    entity may be acting rationally from a local perspective, but no entity perceives
    the magnitude of the lost value in the aggregate (A. Milstein, personal communication,
    July 2004). This behavior precludes spending by individual providers or purchasers
    of HIT for a potential public good dependent upon the cooperation of other independent
    entities. When the vendors of HIT do not perceive their customers stating interoperability
    as a requirement of their systems, they act rationally and do not include these
    features in their products. Thus, there is an opportunity for a third party, such
    as the federal government and private payers, to introduce reimbursement or regulatory
    policy changes that would drive standards adoption. Viable Companies and Products
    The difficulties we have described prevent the development of a robust marketplace
    for HIT. While the academic literature has produced solid evidence on the impact
    of HIT on patient safety,13 the quality of care,14,15 care process efficiencies,16
    and even revenue cycle management,17 the absence of a clear business case and
    fundamental misalignment of incentives has protracted the emergence of this market.
    To its credit, the venture capital community recognizes the potential value of
    HIT and has made considerable investments over the last decade; however, the market
    remains characterized by a few large vendors (typically with diversified product
    portfolios, not solely dependent upon their HIT product lines) selling to providers
    with sufficient operating margins and capital reserves to make considerable investments
    and stay the course, and a large number of small, highly unstable smaller EHR
    vendors with a relatively short mean lifespan. These same providers are typically
    at risk themselves, through self-insured or publicly funded health plans, for
    a percentage or all of their health care expenditures and thus experience the
    rewards of HIT investments themselves through internally aligned incentives (for
    example, Kaiser Permanente, Veteran''s Health Administration). The majority of
    physicians'' office environments and small and midsize community hospital settings
    have yet to make significant HIT investments and in many cases do not believe
    they are in a financial position to do so. In the absence of a viable marketplace,
    and with little barrier to entry in the absence of a standards conformance requirement,
    the HIT industry is replete with hundreds of EHR vendors attempting to provide
    products to fulfill niche requirements from just a few customers, paying little
    attention to functional, data representation, or interoperability standards for
    EHR. While the EHR may be conceived as a “system of systems”18 the lack of clarity
    around basic product definition, relevant standards, and market segments, stifles
    demand from a wary customer. Recommendations We now discuss four areas in which
    we suggest action is warranted to help stimulate the adoption of EHRs in this
    country: market incentives; EHR and informatics standards; enabling policy; and
    educational, marketing, and supporting activities. We prioritize these in a manner
    that we believe will lead to the quickest response, and in several areas efforts
    are underway. However, some require additional effort, and we suggest these initiatives
    may proceed concurrently. This report represents the authors'' opinions on these
    issues informed by the ACMI meeting held in February 2004, evidence in the literature,
    and experiences in both academic and commercial settings developing health care
    information technology. Market Incentives Given the heterogeneity of the U.S.
    delivery system and reimbursement mechanisms, we recommend the use of market mechanisms
    to stimulate HIT adoption. Such mechanisms take essentially one of two forms and
    can be expected to produce increased EHR adoption. We also suggest that an EHR
    certification process is called for to identify use of HIT that warrants one or
    both of these mechanisms. Finally, we suggest that open source technologies may
    have a role in lowering the price of HIT applications or components (particularly
    knowledge components), or pieces of the technology infrastructure for interoperability.
    We discuss these recommendations in turn. Reimbursement Reform The most direct
    way to stimulate any market is to increase demand. Such an increase would occur
    if users of HIT were directly or indirectly rewarded for using HIT. A direct reward
    could arise if, for example, payers required not only submission of administrative
    claims data electronically, but also submission of any attendant clinical information
    or other claims attachments in electronic form, and a differential payment was
    made to the provider supplying these data. This requirement would stimulate the
    adoption of HIT so that providers could supply both clinical and administrative
    data electronically. Secondary uses of these data for both individual provider
    performance assessment and secondary population health surveillance and public
    health management would produce secondary gains. A more indirect mechanism would
    be to reward providers for attaining desired performance benchmarks across a variety
    of acute and chronic care conditions in both in-patient and out-patient care settings.
    While not a direct reward for the use of HIT, this would have the likely effect
    of causing providers to adopt HIT to capture relevant performance measures and
    produce timely reports, warrant the bonus payment, or return withheld reimbursement
    from payers. The costs of producing such benchmark reports and gathering the requisite
    data without HIT would be greater than doing so with HIT. Such an approach imposes
    fewer constraints on the providers in terms of what constitutes acceptable HIT,
    and thus many secondary benefits may not as readily accrue—either to the providers
    or to society. Nevertheless, this may be the least invasive mechanism that could
    leverage much of the existing HIT and produce dramatic results. The Bridges to
    Excellence program19 and the Leapfrog Group standards20 are notable examples of
    such efforts for out-patient and in-patient care settings, respectively, and several
    similar programs are in development or pilot stages around the country. Nevertheless,
    there is a paucity of evidence on what the effect of specific financial incentive
    mechanisms on EHR adoption is—this should be a research priority and tops our
    list of recommendations (Table 1). Table 1Recommendations to Stimulate U.S. EHR
    Adoption Expand the HIT Research Agenda Increase funding to evaluate the impact
    of HIT in practice, with a focus on economic outcomes, costs and benefits. Evaluate
    the utility of “open source” or public domain software for EHR and implementation
    and maintenance methods for such systems. Financial Incentives to Stimulate EHR
    Marketplace Reimbursement reform: Establish financial incentives for the use of
    EHR in practice. Capital availability: Establish low-interest loans or a grant
    program to facilitate hardware and software adoption in health care settings.
    EHR Certification and Accreditation: Establish a process to certify EHR products
    as having requisite functionality in accordance with accepted standards and an
    accreditation process for level of use of EHR in practice. HIT Standard Setting
    Coordinate existing efforts to specify essential standards for basic EHR functionality,
    data representation, and messaging. Specify a minimal clinical data set covering
    a patient''s demographics, medications, medical conditions, allergies, advance
    directives, and selected data pertinent to patient safety and health care quality.
    Specify minimal functional standards for HIT systems in acute care and inpatient
    care settings, personal health records, and key functional components such as
    CPOE. Enabling Policy Promulgate Medicare Modernization Act relaxations to Social
    Security Act, Sec. 1877 (Stark). Establish federal policy on clinical data ownership
    and stewardship. Establish policy framework for Regional Health Care Information
    Authorities. Establish U.S. national licensure in the health professions. Educational,
    Marketing, and Supporting Activities. Establish educational and marketing campaign
    for the public—“Got EHR?”. Establish educational campaign for health professionals.
    Establish educational campaign for health care management. Create a National Health
    Care Information Technology Resource Center. Open in new tab Capital Availability
    We believe that reimbursement reform is only one part of what will necessarily
    be a two-part approach to market incentives. While reimbursement reform may cause
    an increase in operating revenue for providers adopting HIT, it does not address
    the fundamental capital barrier that providers face in making the initial investment
    and capital outlay in expensive HIT software, hardware, support services, and
    the lost revenue typically associated with HIT adoption in the early phase of
    implementation. Many experts have described and proposed a variety of mechanisms
    to increase capital availability to small office environments, community hospitals,
    and other care settings, that lack sufficient capital reserves or credit to access
    capital markets. We suggest that what has occurred in many other countries should
    occur in the United States: low interest loans or even one-time grants to providers
    adopting HIT are in the nation''s and the payers'' interest to catalyze HIT adoption.
    Whatever the approach to providing initial hardware and software it must include
    a workable plan to both sustain and update those systems. We need to recognize
    that commitment to HIT is not a one-time expense. EHR Certification Process We
    believe that an EHR certification process is called for to attest to the appropriate
    functionality of EHRs, and an accreditation program is called for to attest to
    the level of use of an EHR in practice. HIT purchasers need assurance that their
    technology purchases will warrant incremental payments from payers. Payers need
    to be assured that their incentives are going to physicians who are using more
    than a spreadsheet as their EHR—it must meet minimal functional standards. In
    addition, they need to have assurance that the system is being used appropriately
    to achieve patient safety and quality gains; for example, that each clinician
    is using an electronic prescribing module for every prescription. While this may
    be viewed by some as something that raises the bar for entry into the HIT marketplace,
    this concern pales in comparison to fears HIT purchasers have that their investments
    will be for naught or concerns of the payer community, who fears being asked to
    comply with one or more of the reimbursement mechanisms we have described with
    no means to ensure compliance with HIT adoption or adequacy of the HIT itself.
    Open Source EHR and Related Technologies Finally, another market mechanism to
    stimulate market demand for a desired product is to lower the price. Many pundits
    have written about so-called “open source” software systems in health care, and
    many providers describe their willingness to pay for HIT at a price-point that
    is far below current prices for EHR.21 While it may be debated whether the open
    source model may ever truly apply to EHR applications given their complexity,
    rich knowledge content for decision support, and mission-critical nature, what
    is clear is that for many providers, one of the main barriers to adoption is the
    cost of current technology. However, it is important to note what has been successful
    using the open source process. Most successes have been with tools and technology
    components rather than large applications. The question of open-source software
    and component technologies warrants critical analysis and may be addressed at
    many levels: perhaps it is not the EHR application before the end user that should
    be open source, but rather the enabling technology and knowledge infrastructure
    underlying and supporting the end-user application. Much like the U.S. interstate
    highway system was viewed as a critical infrastructure for any form of transportation,
    public or private, we suggest that there are analogous critical information infrastructure
    components undergirding local HIT applications used in offices and hospitals that
    will enable the National Healthcare Information Infrastructure (NHII). These may
    include regional transaction hubs or information exchanges, secure networks and
    patient-matching infrastructure, public-interest organizational structures to
    manage regional information exchanges and broker communitywide investment and
    serve as a local certification authority, and so on. In addition, currently, each
    provider organization wrestles with the task of implementing and maintaining knowledge-based
    rules and alerts in its HIT applications. This time-consuming and difficult task
    could be ameliorated if there were an accessible library of such knowledge in
    the public domain. If such component tools and technologies were open source and
    readily available in the public domain, it could have a profound impact on vendors
    building HIT technologies as it would reduce their internal development costs
    and mitigate risks of adopting standards. EHR and Informatics Standards A great
    deal of activity in recent years brought considerable attention to the issue of
    standards development and acceleration of this process.4,8,22 Yet, from either
    a public or private perspective, adoption of even a minimal set of standards remains
    rare with a few notable exceptions.23,24 The standards development organizations
    have focused primarily on specific standards such as messaging and have assumed
    that other groups would develop the additional necessary standards for complete
    interoperability including terminology standards and a reference information model.
    More recently, HL-7, for example, has begun to develop standards for broader areas,
    addressing the complete set of standards that is necessary for interoperable data
    exchange. Lack of awareness regarding existing standards, confusion about which
    standard is the right standard, and lack of proof of the value of standards has
    severely limited the adoption and implementation of standards. We believe that
    specification of a minimal set of essential standards that have the property of
    supporting interoperability (the ability to exchange clinical information reliably)
    is critical to rapid adoption of HIT—and a key component in deriving value from
    HIT.7 It is beyond the scope of this report to recommend specific standards, but
    we suggest that efforts underway in the Consolidated Healthcare Informatics initiative,
    the newly created Commission on Systemic Interoperability, and private sector
    efforts at HL-7 and ASTM, be coordinated to ensure successful definition of essential
    standards for clinical information content representation and messaging.25 Beyond
    the specification of standards for clinical information content and messaging,
    additional work is needed in specifying a variety of uniform clinical information
    data sets to facilitate interoperability between EHR implementations. The Continuity
    of Care Record effort26 is a notable example in which a set of information is
    defined to facilitate transfer of patients between health care entities for care
    and is a useful intermediate step toward seamless health care information exchange
    and interoperability. We believe such instruments should be based upon a minimal
    set of patient care information that includes patient demographics, insurance
    coverage, allergies, medications, current medical problems and conditions, and
    the patient''s advance directives. Such a core data set serves as a means by which
    clinicians may quickly become familiar with a patient and serves as a foundation
    for clinical decision support in electronic health records. Availability of a
    common core set of laboratory data, and such ancillary information as prior electrocardiogram,
    would also be useful to promote patient safety and health care quality, and reduce
    redundant utilization. Another area requiring definition and clarity is in the
    area of functionality of clinical information systems. Not only is this useful
    from the business perspectives described above, it also is critical for enabling
    the interoperability of an essential minimal care data set and is essential for
    certification purposes that will warrant additional payments or other incentives
    to providers from payers when the use of an EHR can be documented and attested
    to. The HL-7 functional model of the EHR is an excellent start, and the draft
    standard is now available for trial use.27 It is clear, however, that much more
    work needs to be done on functional standards for personal health records that
    interact with EHR systems, inpatient clinical information systems, and additional
    detail and specification regarding critical functional modules such as provider
    order entry and clinical decision support. Enabling Policy We identify four areas
    in which national policy could have a profound impact on the adoption of HIT:
    modification of Stark antitrust regulations, policies to guide clinical data ownership
    and stewardship, mechanisms to support creation of regional health care information
    authorities, and lastly, and with a longer view of clinical practice in this country,
    establishing means for national professional licensure in the health care professions.
    We discuss these in turn. The Medicare Modernization Act22 (MMA) supports provider
    adoption of electronic prescribing technology and provides for some relaxation
    of the Stark regulations in the Social Security Act (Section 1877). It is critical
    that these regulations be supported in practice from two perspectives. First,
    physicians in distinct organizational entities (different businesses) must be
    allowed to form purchasing cooperatives to allow economies of scale to accrue
    in HIT purchasing decisions. This would allow providers to experience considerable
    savings when participating in volume purchase agreements with vendors. Secondly,
    larger hospitals and integrated delivery networks must be allowed to improve the
    ability of physicians using their office technology to interact with that hospital
    or IDN clinical information systems for review of patient care data. In addition,
    health care data from the provider offices should be made available to the hospital
    systems. In situations in which community providers have affiliations with multiple
    inpatient care facilities, this ability is particularly important for patient
    safety and quality of care—they must have a complete view of their patients''
    health care data from wherever care is provided. The MMA requirement that the
    hospital or IDN data be made available to any provider in the community may only
    be made possible through a community health information exchange. Before discussing
    regional information exchange, however, it is useful to address clinical information
    ownership and stewardship. Many physicians express concern about adopting HIT
    when they cannot be assured that the information will be made available to them
    should they elect to switch EHR vendors. In addition, de-identified, aggregated
    clinical data may be viewed as a critical public good in light of bioterrorism
    and protecting the public health—biosurveillance and epidemiology research would
    be well served through access to anonymous clinical data arising from EHRs. The
    regulations implementing the HIPAA provide guidance for managing information security
    and privacy. These guidelines have been used effectively to facilitate the most
    notable demonstration of clinical information exchange to date—the Indiana Network
    for Patient Care (INPC). In this case, clinical information is shared broadly
    across the greater Indianapolis metropolitan area. Stewardship for the data is
    provided by the Regenstrief Institute, which is well versed in clinical information
    management and has the leadership, technical capacity, and political capital to
    help establish policies and procedures for the INPC. The lessons learned from
    this demonstration and others5,28 should be collected and elevated to the national
    policy level so that other communities wishing to create similar regional health
    care information exchanges could readily adopt policies and procedures that work.
    While the HIPAA legislation, including the Privacy Rule, established protections
    for the security and confidentiality of personally identifiable health care information,
    it does not address fundamental issues of data ownership. Clarification of the
    rights of both the providers who gather and collect patient data, and the patient
    as source of the data, would be useful to help establish the value of these data
    and appropriate uses of the data in exchange for compensation in research and
    marketing purposes. Clarification of these rights and privileges will help define
    the methods to obtain patient consent and grant access to or exchange of personally
    identifiable health care information by authorized individuals. Such policy could
    allow explicit recognition of the multiple uses of medical record data within
    health care institutions and providers'' offices for billing, documentation, decision
    support, and quality analysis, as well as the patient''s rights with respect to
    secondary uses of the data beyond health care operations. To derive value from
    HIT in clinical settings, two things must happen simultaneously: functionally
    rich EHRs supporting comprehensive patient data management, decision support,
    and health care workflow must be adopted in acute and chronic care settings,3
    and these systems must share data with one another. That is, clinical information
    systems in disparate health care business entities must exchange clinical information
    on common patients for treatment purposes.2 Given the rational but myopic business
    perspective of most health care providers, we believe that to achieve regional
    health care information exchange, an appropriate regional authority must be established
    to guide development and implementation of data sharing policies and procedures
    among providers and patients, legal frameworks, enabling technologies (e.g., patient
    matching algorithms), and management of shared expenses and financial benefits
    in a coherent and sustainable business model. Such regional health care information
    exchanges are under development in several areas,10,21,28 and several legislative
    efforts support this notion,29 but it would be useful to have in place federal
    guidelines, and seed money, that could be applied locally and regionally to ensure
    their success. Finally, with the advent of “wired” clinical care environments
    and their emerging interconnectivity, and an increasingly mobile patient, we suggest
    that soon it will be advantageous for providers and their patients to have licensure
    in the health professions be provided at the federal level. Providers should be
    able to act on behalf of their patients even remotely; for example, when a patient
    is in another state, experiences a medical problem, and communicates electronically
    with his or her provider at home (who has access to both the local and remote
    health care data). Short of national licensure per se, relaxation of state regulations
    to facilitate reciprocity of professional licensure between state agencies is
    a worthy first step. Broadening the geographic scope of licensure in the heath
    professions will allow the development of regional health care information exchanges
    that truly reflect “medical marketplaces” that may span across state boundaries.
    With national licensure or improved reciprocity between states, providers would
    be able to physically practice more readily in more than one state. More importantly,
    however, as health care becomes more “wired,” providers will be able to seamlessly
    collaborate across state lines, rendering opinions remotely from the patient care
    site or remotely performing critical interpretive duties such as reading radiology,
    nuclear, electrocardiographic, sonographic, and other image modalities and interpreting
    biomedical signals, which do not require physical proximity to the patient. Educational,
    Marketing, and Supporting Activities Achieving President Bush''s vision—that most
    Americans would have an electronic health record within ten years—will require
    an extraordinary effort. In addition to the recommendations above, we feel there
    is need for an educational and marketing campaign not dissimilar to the public
    announcements and efforts surrounding smoking cessation, drug abuse, obesity,
    accident prevention, and other campaigns in the interest of the public''s health.
    At the 2004 ACMI Retreat, Kevin Johnson of Vanderbilt University suggested a campaign:
    “Got EHR?” We suggest a three-pronged marketing and educational campaign directed
    at consumers, health care professionals, and the executive suites of our provider
    organizations across the country. The public has heard the news from the IOM reports
    that made the front pages of local newspapers, describing medical error,30 poor
    quality of care, and the role of HIT,31 but they do not yet generally perceive
    the risks of receiving care from providers and hospitals that do not have HIT
    with clinical decision support in place. It is often mistakenly believed that
    HIT is already in use.32 Just as a consumer buying a car today would never think
    of selecting one without seatbelts, airbags, or other safety features, American
    consumers should ask whether their personal physician and their hospital have
    CPOE and EHR systems in place and in use. Secondly, health care professionals
    may be increasingly aware of the potential benefits of HIT, but they have not
    yet adopted these technologies to any significant degree. In conjunction with
    alignment of incentives and reimbursement reforms we have described, an education
    campaign needs to be directed toward health care professionals to help them understand
    the potential of HIT, its use, and its limitations. This may begin by expanding
    the curriculum devoted to clinical informatics in the health professions schools.
    Finally, an educational campaign should also be directed at the executive suites
    of our health care enterprises, both large and small, where the strategic and
    investment decisions are made about the business of health care. Without leadership
    and commitment, whether it is the small office environment or the largest IDN,
    adoption of HIT will not proceed. Even if every physician, nurse, and hospital
    were committed to adopting HIT, however, to facilitate rapid adoption, it is critical
    that we engineer adoption strategies that scale. That is, every clinic and hospital
    environment must not be forced to rediscover best practices for implementing HIT;
    there should be a National Resource Center for HIT that can be a repository of
    best practices and expertise for HIT implementation to accelerate the process.
    The recently announced requests for proposals from the AHRQ appear to be well
    targeted to meet this need. In addition, we believe there should be a national
    repository that would make available clinical knowledge required for HIT adoption,
    be readable, and be encoded in a standardized manner, including items such as
    appropriate controlled terminology, standard code sets, care rules, alerts and
    reminders, order sets, documentation templates, and forms, so that each clinic
    and hospital does not have to rediscover the best clinical knowledge for implementation
    within their chosen clinical systems. We believe the absence of such a resource
    protracts the implementation of HIT, and in some settings, the absence of the
    appropriate resources will make sophisticated decision support in clinical systems
    an unattainable goal. These resources should be public–private collaboratives
    that serve the interests of the HIT marketplace as well as the public and private
    purchasers of health care. Conclusion There is growing support for the widespread
    adoption of EHR as a fundamental strategy to improve U.S. health care delivery,
    efficiency, quality, and safety. Despite considerable evidence to support adoption
    of EHR, progress has been slow to date. We suggest that the current HIT marketplace
    has failed because of several factors, including misalignment of financial incentives,
    absence of a clear business case for EHR adoption and for interoperability between
    EHR implementations, and incomplete specification and adoption of relevant standards.
    To accelerate EHR adoption we believe a variety of stimuli are needed to align
    incentives, provide new incentives for adoption of interoperable EHRs, coordinate
    and promote relevant standards, and educate the health care community and consumers.

  explanation: This systematic review aimed to explore the challenges and strategies
    for integrating automated systems with existing irrigation infrastructure and
    other precision agriculture technologies. The authors searched relevant databases
    for studies published between January 2000 and May 2022, and identified 14 relevant
    studies. They found that the integration of automated systems with irrigation
    infrastructure can improve water use efficiency, reduce labor costs, and increase
    crop yields. However, there are also challenges to consider, such as the high
    cost of implementation, the need for skilled labor to operate and maintain the
    systems, and the potential for increased waterlogging and salinization.

    \ \nMany promising technological innovations in health and social care are characterized\
    \ by nonadoption or\nabandonment by individuals or by failed attempts to scale\
    \ up locally, spread distantly, or sustain the innovation long term at the\norganization\
    \ or system level.\nObjective: Our objective was to produce an evidence-based,\
    \ theory-informed, and pragmatic framework to help predict and\nevaluate the success\
    \ of a technology-supported health or social care program.\nMethods: The study\
    \ had 2 parallel components: (1) secondary research (hermeneutic systematic review)\
    \ to identify key domains,\nand (2) empirical case studies of technology implementation\
    \ to explore, test, and refine these domains. We studied 6\ntechnology-supported\
    \ programs—video outpatient consultations, global positioning system tracking\
    \ for cognitive impairment,\npendant alarm services, remote biomarker monitoring\
    \ for heart failure, care organizing software, and integrated case management\n\
    via data sharing—using longitudinal ethnography and action research for up to\
    \ 3 years across more than 20 organizations. Data\nwere collected at micro level\
    \ (individual technology users), meso level (organizational processes and systems),\
    \ and macro level\n(national policy and wider context). Analysis and synthesis\
    \ was aided by sociotechnically informed theories of individual,\norganizational,\
    \ and system change. The draft framework was shared with colleagues who were introducing\
    \ or evaluating other\ntechnology-supported health or care programs and refined\
    \ in response to feedback.\nResults: The literature review identified 28 previous\
    \ technology implementation frameworks, of which 14 had taken a dynamic\nsystems\
    \ approach (including 2 integrative reviews of previous work). Our empirical dataset\
    \ consisted of over 400 hours of\nethnographic observation, 165 semistructured\
    \ interviews, and 200 documents. The final nonadoption, abandonment, scale-up,\n\
    spread, and sustainability (NASSS) framework included questions in 7 domains:\
    \ the condition or illness, the technology, the\nvalue proposition, the adopter\
    \ system (comprising professional staff, patient, and lay caregivers), the organization(s),\
    \ the wider\n(institutional and societal) context, and the interaction and mutual\
    \ adaptation between all these domains over time. Our empirical\ncase studies\
    \ raised a variety of challenges across all 7 domains, each classified as simple\
    \ (straightforward, predictable, few\ncomponents), complicated (multiple interacting\
    \ components or issues), or complex (dynamic, unpredictable, not easily disaggregated\n\
    into constituent components). Programs characterized by complicatedness proved\
    \ difficult but not impossible to implement.\nThose characterized by complexity\
    \ in multiple NASSS domains rarely, if ever, became mainstreamed. The framework\
    \ showed\npromise when applied (both prospectively and retrospectively) to other\
    \ programs.\nJ Med Internet Res 2017 | vol. 19 | iss. 11 | e367 | p. 1\nhttp://www.jmir.org/2017/11/e367/\n\

    \ testing, NASSS could be applied across a range of technological innovations\
    \ in health\nand social care. It has several potential uses: (1) to inform the\
    \ design of a new technology; (2) to identify technological solutions\nthat (perhaps\
    \ despite policy or industry enthusiasm) have a limited chance of achieving large-scale,\
    \ sustained adoption; (3) to\nplan the implementation, scale-up, or rollout of\
    \ a technology program; and (4) to explain and learn from program failures.\n\

    \ scale-up, spread, sustainability framework; innovation adoption\nBackground\n\
    In 2004 and 2005, Greenhalgh et al published a multilevel\nframework for studying\
    \ diffusion of innovations in health care,\nbased on a cross-disciplinary systematic\
    \ literature review [1,2].\nA key finding was that most empirical studies had\
    \ focused on\nshort-term adoption of simple innovations by individual\nadopters.\
    \ Studies of complex innovations (especially those\nrequiring an organizational-\
    \ or system-level adoption decision\nand a recurrent budget line); of the nonadoption\
    \ and\nabandonment of innovations by individuals; and of local\nscale-up, distant\
    \ spread, and long-term sustainability were\nsparse.\nAn update of that review\
    \ in 2010 focused explicitly on\norganizational-level \nadoption \nand \nmainstreaming\
    \ \nof\ntechnological innovations [3]. It identified some new literature\non organizational-level\
    \ routinization [4], but little new evidence\non scale-up, spread, or sustainability—a\
    \ finding that has been\nconfirmed by other reviews since [5-9].\nIn recent years,\
    \ technological innovation has moved apace and\nis now widely viewed as a significant\
    \ potential contributor to\nhealth and wealth [10]. Yet the track record of technology\n\
    programs, especially those that require major changes in\norganizations or the\
    \ wider care system, is poor because of the\ncombined problems of nonadoption\
    \ and abandonment by\nindividuals and difficulties with scale-up and spread [11].\
    \ While\nthere is a growing general literature on the long-term\nsustainability\
    \ of technology-supported change [12], studies of\nthe sustainability of health\
    \ and social care programs remain\nsparse.\nThese problems are illustrated by\
    \ the paradox of telehealth (a\nterm with contested definitions [13] but, broadly\
    \ speaking,\nremote health care to the patient’s home). Despite much\npolicy-level\
    \ talk of triggering a revolution in service delivery\nand many small-scale proof-of-concept\
    \ examples, telehealth\nservices are rarely mainstreamed or sustained [14]. Nonadoption\n\
    and abandonment of telehealth technologies by their intended\nusers is common\
    \ [15-17]. A nationwide audit in Norway showed\nthat, despite geographical remoteness,\
    \ a history of early adoption\nof telehealth, a strong policy push, and adoption\
    \ in principle by\n75% of all hospitals, fewer than 1% of outpatient consultations\n\
    in participating specialties were actually undertaken via\ntelehealth in 2013\
    \ [18].\nPoor uptake of technological innovations is often explained in\nterms\
    \ of barriers and facilitators. In a recent review of telehealth\nin heart failure,\
    \ for example, we identified technology barriers,\npatient barriers, staff barriers,\
    \ team barriers, business and\nfinancial barriers, and governance and regulatory\
    \ barriers [13].\nThis list (and a reciprocal list of facilitators) resonates\
    \ with\nother barriers-and-facilitators studies in the literature, including\n\
    electronic patient record systems [7,19], electronic prescribing\n[20,21] and\
    \ surgical safety checklists [22]. Such studies are a\nuseful start, but they\
    \ fall short of theorizing the failure to adopt,\nscale up, spread, or sustain\
    \ a technology-supported program.\nAs our 2004 review of diffusion of innovations\
    \ found, it is not\nindividual factors that make or break a technology\nimplementation\
    \ effort but the dynamic interaction between them.\nThe more complex an innovation\
    \ or the setting in which it is\nintroduced, the less likely it is to be successfully\
    \ adopted, scaled\nup, spread, and sustained [7,23,24]. These interactions are\n\
    unlikely to be elucidated by the randomized controlled trial\ndesign that still\
    \ dominates much health technology research\n[25]. Rather, we need studies that\
    \ are interdisciplinary,\nnondeterministic, locally situated, and designed to\
    \ examine the\nrecursive relationship between human action and the wider\norganizational\
    \ and system context [25].\nAmong others, Lupton [26], May and Finch [27], Nicolini\
    \ [28],\nPols and Willems [29], Maniatopoulos et al [30], and our own\nteam [31]\
    \ have used different approaches to produce rich\ntheorizations of the unfolding\
    \ fortunes of technology-supported\nprograms in health care. But such academic\
    \ outputs are not\ndirectly accessible to the clinician on the ward, the manager\
    \ in\nthe office, or the executive in the boardroom—nor, indeed, to\nthe patient\
    \ in his or her home. Other authors (whose work is\nsummarized in the Results\
    \ section below) have drawn on such\nliterature to produce unifying frameworks\
    \ aimed at informing\nthe work of implementation, although no previous framework\n\
    has focused explicitly on nonadoption, abandonment, scale-up,\nspread, or sustainability.\n\
    We aimed to produce an evidence-based, theory-informed, but\nalso accessible and\
    \ usable framework that would enable those\nseeking to design, develop, implement,\
    \ scale up, spread, and\nsustain technology-supported health or social care programs\
    \ to\nidentify and help address the key challenges in different domains\nand the\
    \ interactions between them.\nMethods\nStudy Design\nFigure 1 summarizes our design\
    \ and methodology. The study\nhad 2 parallel components: (1) secondary research\
    \ (hermeneutic\nsystematic review) to identify key domains and interactions,\n\

    Primary Research: 6 Empirical Case Studies\nWe selected a diverse sample of case\
    \ studies from 2 research\nprograms: Virtual Online Consultations: Advantages\
    \ and\nLimitations (VOCAL) and Studies in Co-creating Assisted\nLiving Solutions\
    \ (SCALS), whose detailed methodology and\nethical approval have been described\
    \ elsewhere [25,32]. VOCAL\n(2015-2017, with an earlier set-up phase from 2011)\
    \ was an\nin-depth study of the development, introduction, and local\nrollout\
    \ of remote (video) consultations across 3 contrasting\nclinical specialties in\
    \ a large, multisite UK hospital trust [32].\nSCALS (2015-2020, with some data\
    \ collected from 2013) is an\naction research study of the challenges faced by\
    \ UK health and\nsocial care organizations who introduce technology-supported\n\
    new service models; it includes examples from health care (eg,\nremote biomarker\
    \ monitoring, video consultations, technologies\nfor integrating care across organizations)\
    \ and social care (safety\nalarms, global positioning system [GPS] tracking, care\n\
    organizing apps) [25].\nCase studies in VOCAL and SCALS involved qualitative\n\
    interviews (with patients, clinicians, managers, technical\ndesigners, \ncommercial\
    \ \npartners, \nand—where\nrelevant—investors), analysis of documents (correspondence,\n\
    business plans, clinical records), ethnography (of technology\nuse by patients\
    \ or clients and staff, of meetings and events, and\nof technology design and\
    \ functionality), and video recording\nof both ends of remote consultations [25,32].\

    \ Review\nArticles describing technology implementation frameworks and\ntheir\
    \ applications were eligible if they (1) studied a technology\nthat was perceived\
    \ as new by intended users, (2) aimed (through\nthe uptake and use of the technology)\
    \ to improve service\nefficiency, or patient or client outcomes in health or social\
    \ care;\nand (3) offered some kind of conceptual or theoretical\nframework. We\
    \ were particularly interested in patient-facing\ntechnologies such as telehealth,\
    \ but we also assessed other\nframeworks (eg, for health information systems)\
    \ for transferable\ninsights.\nWe began by selecting relevant studies from our\
    \ hermeneutic\nliterature review of telehealth in heart failure (covering 32\n\
    previous systematic reviews and 60 additional articles, including\nmany that covered\
    \ conditions beyond heart failure) [13]. We\nsearched the reference lists of key\
    \ studies [33-41]; we also put\ntheir titles into Google Scholar to identify 160\
    \ articles\n(surprisingly few) that had cited them subsequently, and\nmanually\
    \ screened these titles for relevance. We chose this\n“ancestry and snowballing”\
    \ approach because initial database\nsearching proved neither sensitive nor specific\
    \ [42].\nHaving obtained few hits, we extended our search to the wider\nliterature\
    \ by tracking our original 2004 diffusion of innovations\nreview [1]; we manually\
    \ screened the titles and abstracts of over\n4500 publications that had cited\
    \ it. We did the same with 8 other\nhighly cited reviews on the broader topic\
    \ of innovation in health\ncare [4-9,27,43] (around 3000 additional hits), using\
    \ progressive\nfocusing to limit the dataset. We favored authoritative reviews\n\
    and added selected primary studies (characterized by strong\ntheory, naturalistic\
    \ methods, and rich detail, and including a\nfocus on technology implementation).\
    \ Where articles cited a\nspecific theory, we obtained the original article describing\
    \ that\ntheory.\nWe used a simple data extraction form to summarize key aspects\n\
    of each study (both theoretical and empirical). Using the\nhermeneutic (interpretive)\
    \ methodology described in detail\npreviously [13], we combined the findings of\
    \ primary studies\nand previous reviews to generate a preliminary list of domains,\n\
    potential interactions, and theoretical mechanisms.\nSynthesis and Framework Development\n\
    All 6 case studies generated large amounts of qualitative and\nquantitative data,\
    \ not all of which was relevant to the objective\nof this study. Our first task\
    \ was to delineate a more focused\ndataset of individual index cases (patients\
    \ or clients) along with\nrelevant staff interviews, field notes, and background\
    \ documents\n(Table 1). For each case study, we analyzed qualitative data\nthematically\
    \ and produced an initial narrative summary of the\ncase, which we refined in\
    \ the light of emerging theoretical\nevidence from the literature review. We conducted\
    \ data analysis\nof the empirical case studies in parallel with progress on the\n\
    hermeneutic literature review; each influenced the other.\nFindings broadly coalesced\
    \ around key domains of influence\n(the patient, the technology, staff, and so\
    \ on), which informed\nthe development of an initial framework and raised further\n\
    questions about the implementation process.\nRefinement, Peer Review, and Testing\n\
    We developed initial versions of the nonadoption, abandonment,\nscale-up, spread,\
    \ and sustainability (NASSS) diagram and\nframework part way through the empirical\
    \ work to guide our\naction research and inform cross-case theorization. As we\n\
    applied the framework to real cases, challenges occurred that\nwere not covered\
    \ by it (eg, patients unable to use technologies\nbecause of comorbidities), so\
    \ we searched more specifically for\narticles to inform additional domains and\
    \ questions. We shared\na near-final version of the framework with colleagues\
    \ involved\nin 10 further large-scale technology-supported change programs\n(including\
    \ email and video consultations in primary care; an\nonline peer support network\
    \ for people with mental health needs;\nremote biomarker monitoring in transplant\
    \ patients; and an\nonline tool for people to identify local services appropriate\
    \ to\ntheir health and care needs); we further refined the framework\nin the light\
    \ of their feedback.\nResults\nTable 1 shows the datasets for our empirical case\
    \ studies. Below,\nwe give a brief overview of the cases before summarizing our\n\
    literature review and introducing the NASSS framework.\nEmpirical Case Studies\n\
    Case A: Video Outpatient Consultations\nThis case included 4 clinical services:\
    \ 3 hospital-based services\nfrom VOCAL (young adult diabetes, prenatal diabetes,\
    \ and\ncancer surgery, all using Skype; SS, unpublished data, 2017)\nand 1 community-based\
    \ from SCALS (a nurse-led heart failure\nservice run from 4 community hospitals,\
    \ using predominantly\nFaceTime). In each, patients judged “appropriate” for video\n\
    consultations by the doctor or nurse were offered this option.\nNational policy\
    \ makers viewed video consulting as a way of\ndelivering health care efficiently\
    \ to an aging population with\nrising rates of chronic illness. But the reality\
    \ of establishing\nsuch services in busy and financially stretched public sector\n\
    organizations proved far more complex and difficult than\nanticipated; progress\
    \ was slow and required multiple\norganizational workarounds. Technical challenges\
    \ in setting up\nvideo consultations with patients were typically mundane but\n\
    potentially prohibitive (eg, forgotten passwords, poor\nconnectivity, outdated\
    \ software). When clinical, technical, and\npractical preconditions were met,\
    \ video consultations appeared\nsafe and were popular with both patients and staff,\
    \ although\nonly some clinicians agreed to participate.\nBy the end of the study\
    \ period, video consultations had been\nabandoned in the prenatal diabetes service\
    \ and put on hold in\nthe community heart failure service, but the young adult\
    \ diabetes\nand cancer surgery services were conducting around 20% of\nfollow-up\
    \ consultations remotely. In the (extremely busy)\nprenatal diabetes clinic, video\
    \ consultations aligned poorly with\na context involving multidisciplinary teams\
    \ (patients were\ntypically seeing multiple clinicians across departments) for\
    \ a\nrelatively short-term but high-risk condition and in the absence\nof integrated\
    \ records (paper medical notes were held by the\npatient so not physically at\
    \ hand for the clinician). In the heart\nfailure clinic, the physical examination\
    \ (eg, heart rhythm, leg\nJ Med Internet Res 2017 | vol. 19 | iss. 11 | e367 |\
    \ p. 5\nhttp://www.jmir.org/2017/11/e367/\n(page number not for citation purposes)\n\
    Greenhalgh et al\nJOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH\nXSL•FO\nRenderX\nedema)\
    \ that the nurses considered essential was not easy in the\nremote environment\
    \ (although sometimes possible with patient\nand caregiver assistance); multimorbidity\
    \ and polypharmacy\nwere common and in most cases the perceived risks and\nuncertainties\
    \ associated with remote consulting were considered\nto outweigh the benefits.\n\
    Case B: GPS Tracking in Cognitive Impairment\nElectronic tracking through GPS\
    \ is used to monitor people with\ncognitive impairment who “wander” outside the\
    \ home. We\nworked with a public sector social care organization to\nimplement\
    \ and adapt GPS tracking devices and a linked\nmonitoring service for such individuals\
    \ (of whom 11 were\nconsidered eligible and 7 assented). In what were typically\
    \ very\ncomplex care contexts, GPS devices were useful to the extent\nthat they\
    \ aligned with a wider sociotechnical care network that\nincluded lay caregivers,\
    \ call centers, and health and social care\nprofessionals. In this context, “safe”\
    \ wandering was a\ncollaborative accomplishment that depended on the technology’s\n\
    material features, affordances, and aesthetic properties; a\ndistributed knowledge\
    \ of the individual and the places they\nwandered through; and a collective and\
    \ dynamic interpretation\nof risk. Each index case required a high degree of tinkering\n\
    (including customization of the device, liaison with the\ntechnology supplier,\
    \ and adjustment of work routines) to achieve\na solution that was acceptable.\
    \ Despite this, only 3 individuals\nwere still using the technology by the end\
    \ of the 18-month study\nperiod.\nCase C: Pendant Alarms\nPendant alarms (worn\
    \ around the neck or on a wrist strap and\nconnected to a remote call center)\
    \ were the only patient-facing\ntechnology in widespread use in our dataset. Both\
    \ study sites\nhad a well-established sociotechnical infrastructure that included\n\
    a named care team with expertise and local knowledge. Supply\nof a pendant alarm\
    \ was typically initiated by a public sector\norganization and involved a local\
    \ technology supplier to fit it,\nwith or without support from an age charity.\
    \ Clients could also\nself-refer. The setup usually depended on a network of lay\n\
    caregivers available to respond to a summons; a safe box was\nusually installed\
    \ containing a key so the rescuer could let\nthemselves in, or an emergency response\
    \ (eg, ambulance or\n24/7 social care) was summoned as required. Users paid a\
    \ set-up\nfee (around £25; US $40) plus a small weekly support fee\n(around £4.50;\
    \ US $7), although some local care providers\noffered this service free of charge\
    \ (eg, to people in receipt of\nwelfare benefits). In almost all cases, the individual\
    \ had multiple\nand complex needs (physical, cognitive, social) and was using\n\
    multiple technologies in addition to the alarm [44].\nIn many but not all cases,\
    \ activation of the pendant alarm led\nto help arriving promptly. On some occasions,\
    \ there was a\nmismatch: the alarm was triggered when there was no objective\n\
    need (perhaps by accident) or, more commonly, not triggered\nwhen caregivers felt\
    \ it should have been—because the individual\ndid not want to trouble anyone,\
    \ did not believe the problem was\nserious or urgent or was unable to activate\
    \ the device (eg, during\na fit), or was not wearing the alarm at the time of\
    \ the crisis.\nSometimes, call center operators made judgments and put in\n“emotional\
    \ work” to support the caller without alerting their\nrelative or reassured them\
    \ while help was on its way [45]. In 1\nsite, use of pendant alarms had evolved\
    \ in that some lonely\npeople (especially those with cognitive impairment) were\
    \ being\nencouraged to press the alert button and talk to a call center\noperator\
    \ even when there was no emergency, in order to reduce\ncall-outs of the emergency\
    \ services.\nCase D: Remote Biomarker Monitoring (Telehealth)\nThis case study\
    \ involved cardiology departments in 6 UK\nhospitals, each implementing biomarker\
    \ monitoring (weight,\nblood pressure, heart rate) for heart failure as part of\
    \ a\nmulticenter randomized controlled trial (Seamless User-Centred\nProactive\
    \ Provision of Risk-Stratified Treatment for Heart\nFailure [SUPPORT-HF]). The\
    \ tablet technology supplied to\npatient participants had been developed using\
    \ a codesign\nmethodology [46]. Participants in both arms of the trial received\n\
    the technology and automated feedback messages (eg, if results\nwent outside preset\
    \ parameters); in the intervention arm, the\npatient’s family physician was alerted\
    \ to out-of-range results\nand offered suggestions for changes in therapy, whereas\
    \ in the\ncontrol arm, results were made available on a Web portal for\nthe patient’s\
    \ physician to access if they chose to. Staff at the\ndifferent SUPPORT-HF sites\
    \ engaged variably with the study,\nsometimes leading to slower than predicted\
    \ recruitment. A\nminority of clinicians were reluctant to refer patients or engage\n\
    with the trial protocol, citing “previous bad experiences with\ntelehealth,” concern\
    \ that a remote monitoring service would\nthreaten their jobs, or a perception\
    \ that patients “deserved\nbetter.” Patient participants expressed a range of\
    \ views about\nremote biomarker monitoring; some took an active interest in\n\
    their readings, engaged enthusiastically with the feedback they\nreceived, and\
    \ found this monitoring reassuring. Others found\nthe experience confusing and\
    \ did not know (or wish to know)\nwhat the numbers meant. In some cases, a research\
    \ nurse known\nto the participants provided (unofficial) telephone support to\n\
    maintain engagement. Another problem with the remote\nmonitoring service was the\
    \ variability of broadband speed\noutside the main cities, which meant that more\
    \ than half of\npotentially eligible participants in 1 site could not be included\n\
    in the study.\nCase E: Care Organizing Software\nThis case study followed the\
    \ very different fortunes of 2\nsoftware products, each designed to help relatives\
    \ and friends\n(and sometimes professional staff as well) organize tasks and\n\
    visits for someone with health or care needs. Product A, a Web\nportal, had been\
    \ developed in-house by a small software\ncompany, based on a previous caring\
    \ experience by one of the\ncompany staff. The business model was to sell the\
    \ product to\ncare organizations who would then provide it to their clients\n\
    for free. The developer did not initially anticipate that either\nintended end\
    \ users or participating care organizations would\nneed any training or ongoing\
    \ support to use the portal. Product\nA was not successful during the study period;\
    \ fewer than 5\nfamilies were ever identified as actively using it.\nProduct B\
    \ was a smartphone app (with linked Web portal) that\nhad been developed via publicly\
    \ funded research and\ndevelopment using codesign methodology by a national\n\
    caregivers’charity. The charity had previously identified a need\nJ Med Internet\
    \ Res 2017 | vol. 19 | iss. 11 | e367 | p. 6\nhttp://www.jmir.org/2017/11/e367/\n\
    (page number not for citation purposes)\nGreenhalgh et al\nJOURNAL OF MEDICAL\
    \ INTERNET RESEARCH\nXSL•FO\nRenderX\nfor such software; they worked with a specialist\
    \ app developer\ncompany and carefully selected pilot families. From the outset,\n\
    the charity recognized that caregivers would need to be made\naware of the product\
    \ through mass mailing and to be actively\ninvited and supported to use it, and\
    \ that a helpdesk service would\nbe needed. The app was made available commercially\
    \ (via the\nApp Store) for £2.99 (about US $5). Users signed up gradually\nbut\
    \ steadily; there was no tipping point, but at the time of writing\nover 1000\
    \ families are using the product through the care\ncharity; in a preliminary evaluation,\
    \ most spoke highly of it\n(and of the charity support).\nCase F: Integrated Case\
    \ Management Via Data Sharing\nCase management is a way of organizing health and\
    \ social care\nservices \nthrough \nassessment \nand \ncare \nplanning \nby\n\
    multidisciplinary teams with the aim of managing the growing\nchallenge of emergency\
    \ hospital admissions (and readmissions)\nin older people with multiple health\
    \ and care needs. To avoid\nthe high human and financial cost of such admissions,\n\
    coordinated action and frequent dialogue between primary care\nproviders, secondary\
    \ care providers, and social care and other\nformal and informal caregivers is\
    \ often needed. In the SCALS\nstudy, 1 site had introduced an integrated data\
    \ warehouse\nincorporating a predictive risk modeling tool to automate the\nidentification\
    \ of people at high risk of hospital admissions\nthrough risk stratification,\
    \ and to facilitate shared access to care\nplans in efforts to achieve integrated\
    \ care. Although the data\nwarehouse was part of business as usual in this site,\
    \ in practice\npeople at high risk of hospital admission were identified through\n\
    a combination of risk stratification and clinical judgment. Care\nplans were shared\
    \ in a range of ways, sometimes through the\nintegrated data warehouse and sometimes\
    \ bypassing it.\nLiterature Review\nOur search for evidence-based approaches to\
    \ guide our empirical\nwork on the above case studies identified 28 technology\n\
    implementation frameworks, informed by several theoretical\nperspectives, which\
    \ we sorted into a simple taxonomy\n[13,43,47-72]; see Multimedia Appendix 1.\n\
    A key limitation of many previous frameworks was the lack of\ndetailed analysis\
    \ of the condition or problem for which a new\ntechnology was [part of] the intended\
    \ solution. Some assumed\na “textbook” condition—simple, isolated, easily characterized,\n\
    and amenable to management by algorithm or protocol using a\none-size-fits-all\
    \ (or minimally customizable) technology. Yet\nthere is much empirical evidence\
    \ that the health and care needs\nof real people are extremely heterogeneous,\
    \ even when they\nhave the “same” condition. For example, Tait et al’s\ncase-by-case\
    \ analysis of patients in a heart failure clinic found\nthat every one of them\
    \ required significant customization and\nongoing adaptation of the care package\
    \ recommended in the\nguideline [73].\nA prominent policy prediction, typically\
    \ couched in the language\nof “empowerment,” is that remote technology will make\
    \ care\nmore efficient by encouraging self-management of chronic\nconditions [74].\
    \ But as May et al have pointed out in their\nburden of treatment theory, shifting\
    \ the work of care from clinic\nto community places new demands on the sick (and\
    \ hence raises\nethical questions) [75]. Depending on the condition, such work\n\
    may also be physically or cognitively impossible. The anchored,\nrealistic, cocreative,\
    \ human, integrated, and evaluated\n(ARCHIE) framework derived from our earlier\
    \ empirical work\non assisted living technologies emphasized the diverse\nmanifestations\
    \ of multimorbidity and social care need; it\nrecommends commencing with a realistic\
    \ assessment of the\nnature (and likely progression) of the condition and a focus\
    \ on\nwhat matters to the user [47].\nNo previous framework explicitly considered\
    \ inequalities in\naccess, uptake, and use of health and care technologies by\
    \ age,\nsex, socioeconomic status, or ethnic group, although previous\nempirical\
    \ studies have highlighted substantial differences across\nsuch groups [76]. Chronic\
    \ health conditions and care needs are\nstrongly patterned by social determinants.\
    \ For example, type 2\ndiabetes, heart failure, depression, cognitive impairment,\
    \ and\ngeneral frailty are all more than twice as common in the poorest\nand least\
    \ well-educated quintiles of society as in the richest and\nbest educated [77].\
    \ The poor may also have less rich social\nnetworks, less reliable access to broadband,\
    \ lower digital\nliteracy, and greater likelihood of having problems such as debt\n\
    or unsuitable housing [77,78].\nMost previous frameworks addressed the material\
    \ properties of\nthe technology, such as its physical features, functionality,\
    \ and\ninteroperability. Few considered its symbolic properties (some\ntechnologies—such\
    \ as mobile phones—have connotations of\nyouth, progress, and friendship; others—such\
    \ as GPS tracking\ndevices or pendant alarms—symbolize dependence or external\n\
    control). One or two frameworks considered what knowledge\nor skills (and hence\
    \ training and support) were needed for\nintended users to be confident in operating\
    \ the technology.\nA question addressed tangentially or not at all by previous\n\
    frameworks was what kind of knowledge does the technology\ngenerate? For example,\
    \ telehealth technologies fall into two\nbroad categories. Remote monitoring devices\
    \ transmit objective\nbiomarkers such as weight, blood pressure, and oxygen\n\
    saturation, and responses to closed questions on symptoms and\ncompliance, and\
    \ perhaps also transmit instructions or\neducational messages (what Pols has called\
    \ “cold” telehealth\n[79]). Remote communication devices create the possibility\
    \ for\nmore conventional conversations between patients and clinicians\nby telephone\
    \ or video (“warm” telehealth). These different\ntechnologies bring very different\
    \ kinds of knowledge into play\nand, by design or default, exclude other knowledge\
    \ and\ninfluences from the frame.\nVery few frameworks in our sample included\
    \ an assessment of\nwhether a technology was likely to be worth introducing—that\n\
    is, its value proposition. “Value” means different things to\ndifferent stakeholders;\
    \ it has parallels to Rogers’ term “relative\nadvantage’(the extent to which a\
    \ potential adopter believes that\nthe innovation is better than what has gone\
    \ before [80]). From\nthe patient’s perspective, there is often a trade-off between\
    \ the\npotential benefits of technologies, their costs (and the person’s\nwillingness\
    \ and ability to contribute to these), the work required\nto use them (and the\
    \ person’s capacity to do so), and the\ndesirability of medicalization and surveillance\
    \ [81].\nJ Med Internet Res 2017 | vol. 19 | iss. 11 | e367 | p. 7\nhttp://www.jmir.org/2017/11/e367/\n\

    \ technology’s upstream\nvalue as viewed by investors (especially the business\
    \ case for\ngenerating profits, further spin-offs, and highly qualified jobs),\n\
    drug and device regulators (preliminary evidence of efficacy\nand safety), and\
    \ financial regulators (auditable business\nprocesses and governance), and its\
    \ downstream value as viewed\nby clinicians and policy makers (including its impact\
    \ on patients\nand health care costs) [82,83]. Health technology development\n\
    is often characterized by poor alignment between supply-side\nand demand-side\
    \ value [82,84,85].\nIn previous frameworks, technology adoption by health care\n\
    staff was most commonly theorized using Davis’s technology\nacceptance model,\
    \ comprising perceived usefulness, perceived\nease of use, and attitude toward\
    \ the technology [86]; or\nBandura’s social learning theory, the relevant aspect\
    \ of which\nis that people learn by observing and imitating the behavior of\n\
    others [87,88]. Critics of the technology acceptance model have\nargued that it\
    \ fails to account for human and social change\nprocesses [89]. Sociological theories\
    \ of technology adoption,\nwhich emphasize the norms and expectations associated\
    \ with\ndifferent social positions and professional groups [26,27,31],\nwere not\
    \ extensively used in previous frameworks, with the\nexception of May and Finch’s\
    \ normalization process theory\n[27], of which relational integration—how the\
    \ technology affects\nhuman relations such as the doctor-patient relationship—is\
    \ one\ncomponent.\nIn considering our own case studies, we were drawn to\nsociological\
    \ theories because the new technologies often had\nimplications for staff identity,\
    \ professional commitments, and\nscope of practice. Acceptance by professional\
    \ staff may be the\nsingle most important determinant of whether a new\ntechnology-supported\
    \ service succeeds or fails at a local level\n[17,36,39,79,90,91]. Local champions\
    \ appear key to persuading\ntheir peers that the technology-supported service\
    \ is effective,\nsafe, and “normal” (ie, professionally appropriate) [17,92].\
    \ We\nhave previously developed a theoretical model of clinician\nresistance to\
    \ new health care technology made up of 4 elements:\nresistance to the policy\
    \ reflected in the technology (eg, a policy\nof shifting the work of disease management\
    \ from professional\nto patient); resistance to the sociomaterial constraints\
    \ (eg,\nclunkiness, dependability) of the new technology; resistance to\ncompromised\
    \ professional practice (eg, less scope for exercising\njudgment); and resistance\
    \ to compromised professional\nrelationships (eg, a perception that a remote interaction\
    \ is less\nprofessional than a face-to-face one) [93].\nOne framework in our sample\
    \ addressed technology acceptance\nby patients. The digital health engagement\
    \ model was based on\nboth burden of treatment theory and normalization process\n\
    theory [48]. It proposes 4 key influences on whether an\nindividual will engage\
    \ with a health technology: personal agency\nand motivation (which is affected\
    \ by aspects of their illness);\npersonal life and values; the engagement and\
    \ recruitment\napproach taken by those seeking to promote the technology;\nand\
    \ the quality of the health technology.\nTwo frameworks drew on DeLone and McLean’s\
    \ classic\ntheoretical model of information system success [94]. This\nconsiders\
    \ system quality, information quality, usage attributes,\nuser satisfaction, individual\
    \ impact, and organizational impact\n[49,50]. While this framework had some resonance\
    \ with our\nempirical data, it did not address the patient-facing aspects of\n\
    health and care technologies, nor did it address contextual\ninfluences or change\
    \ over time (we classified it as a static\nframework), and hence did not help\
    \ us with our study of\nscale-up, spread, and sustainability.\nSurprisingly few\
    \ frameworks considered the organizational\nsetting. Some antecedent characteristics\
    \ of organizations have\nbeen shown to support innovation at an organizational\
    \ level [1].\nThese include a devolved organizational structure (with each\ndepartment\
    \ or unit able to make semiautonomous decisions),\nsignificant organizational\
    \ slack (that is, spare resources that can\nbe channeled into new projects), and\
    \ strong leadership, good\nmanagerial relations, a risk-taking climate (staff\
    \ are rewarded\nrather than punished for trying things out), opportunities for\n\
    sense making (that is, collectively arguing out the meaning of\nan innovation\
    \ [95]), and what is known as absorptive capacity:\n“a set of organizational routines\
    \ and processes by which\n[organizations] acquire, assimilate, transform, and\
    \ exploit\nknowledge to create a dynamic organizational capacity” [96].\nThese\
    \ organizational determinants of innovation align with\ncomplexity theory’s emphasis\
    \ on local adaptation and the need\nfor creativity to address unique emerging\
    \ issues [97]. A specific\ninnovation is more likely to be taken up if there is\
    \ strong tension\nfor change, good innovation-system fit (that is, the innovation\n\
    fits well with existing work and routines), widespread support\nfor (and limited\
    \ opposition to) the innovation, and systematic\nassessment of the implications\
    \ [1].\nAnother important aspect of implementation omitted by most\nprevious frameworks\
    \ was the health or care organization’s\nbusiness model for introducing the technology.\
    \ This includes\nthe resources to support the model, key partners and\nrelationships,\
    \ the transaction mechanism (how will the\norganization interact with the supplier?),\
    \ the value structure\n(how and when will value, including benefits for patients,\
    \ be\ncreated and investment costs recouped?), and organizational\ndesign issues\
    \ (what changes in organizational structure and\nprocesses are required or presumed\
    \ by the new technology?)\n[11,14]. A review by van Limburg et al highlighted\
    \ the financial\nand business challenges associated with eHealth technologies,\n\
    including their (typically) fragmented deployment, multiple\nstakeholders and\
    \ interdependencies, lack of recognition of the\nongoing work of implementation,\
    \ and an overreliance on the\nresults of experimental efficacy trials [11].\n\
    Most, but not all, previous frameworks considered how a new\ntechnology would\
    \ fit with existing organizational routines\n(defined as recurrent, collective\
    \ patterns of interaction that both\ncoordinate and control organizational work\
    \ [4]). Technologies\ncreate opportunities for developing new routines and care\n\
    pathways, but they also disrupt existing patterns of team\ninteraction in ways\
    \ that can prove more complex than initially\nanticipated [98]. There is, almost\
    \ inevitably, a crucial gap\nbetween the nuanced, flexible, and often unpredictable\
    \ nature\nof human activity and what it is possible to deliver technically.\n\
    This is especially crucial when considering something as\ncomplex and exception\
    \ filled as clinical work (Case A) [99].\nAs Grudin (cited by Symon et al [100])\

    \ the\nway things are supposed to work and the way they do\nwork. Software that\
    \ is designed to support standard\nprocedures can be too brittle. [page 25]\n\
    Cherns’ classic theory of sociotechnical design, originally\ndeveloped in the\
    \ 1970s, is built on the principle that introducing\ntechnologies in an organization\
    \ is a social process that depends\non values, mindsets, and engagement, as well\
    \ as on clear and\nextensive communication about what changes are occurring and\n\
    why [101]. It is also an evolutionary process (sociotechnical\nsystems are grown,\
    \ not built), hence best achieved by early and\nactive input of frontline workers\
    \ into the [re]design of work\nroutines—a principle that has long been recognized\
    \ (but rarely\nadequately applied) in health care [100,102]. Also highly\nrelevant\
    \ to the health and care environment is what Weick called\n“technology as equivoque”\
    \ [103] and Orlikowski (drawing on\nearlier work on the social construction of\
    \ technology) called\n“interpretive flexibility” [104]: a technology introduced\
    \ into an\norganization is open to multiple interpretations; successful\nembedding\
    \ will require opening up a space for dialogue,\nlistening to concerns, and allowing\
    \ people time to argue out the\nchallenges and learn from the experiences of others\
    \ before a\n“closure” over possible interpretations is reached [88,105]. As\n\
    Stewart and Williams [105] stated,\nInnovation is not restricted to the prior\
    \ design of an\nartefact, but continues as artefacts are implemented\nand used\
    \ (innofusion). Supplier offerings are\ninevitably incomplete in relation to the\
    \ complex,\nheterogeneous and evolving requirements of users;\nwork needs to be\
    \ done by specific users to incorporate\nthese generic solutions to their particular\
    \ contexts\nand practices (domestication). [page 195]\nSurprisingly, few previous\
    \ frameworks in the health and social\ncare literature have attempted to capture\
    \ this insight, which\npartly explains why on-the-job training in technology use\
    \ and\nongoing helpdesk support are key to the implementation process\n[1].\n\
    A prominent theme in our empirical findings—but addressed\ntangentially or not\
    \ at all by most previous frameworks—was\nthat implementing health technology\
    \ programs involves a great\ndeal of work [106]. Normalization process theory\
    \ unpacks\nimplementation work into 4 categories: coherence (the work\nthat people\
    \ do to make sense of a practice), cognitive\nparticipation (work to enroll and\
    \ engage other people in relation\nto that practice), collective action (work\
    \ to enact the new\npractice, including efforts to bridge the model-practice gap\n\
    described above), and reflexive monitoring (the work involved\nin assessing and\
    \ adjusting a practice in use, including evaluating\nthe impact of the technology\
    \ and demonstrating its value to\nothers) [27]. Implementation work may be particularly\
    \ onerous\nin relation to health technologies because of the complexities\nand\
    \ institutional challenges of addressing, for example, data\nsecurity and patient\
    \ privacy, interoperability across multiple\ninformation systems, resistance from\
    \ health care professionals\nwith a high degree of autonomy, and disruption to\
    \ the critical\ngranularity of clinical workflow [106]. First-order problems\n\
    (such as slow technical performance) typically generate\nsecond-order problems,\
    \ such as dramatically increased\nworkloads \n(sometimes \nnecessitating \nsafety-critical\n\
    workarounds), and perhaps third-order ones, such as reputational\ndamage [106].\
    \ Failures in all 4 of May and Finch’s work\ncategories were evident in a systematic\
    \ review of reasons for\nunsuccessful telemedicine implementation informed by\n\
    normalization process theory [107].\nAround half of the frameworks identified\
    \ in this review included\na question on the wider context for technology-supported\
    \ care\n[108]. New technologies generate technical—and commercial\nand political—questions\
    \ around interoperability standards,\ncustomer lock-in, customizability, substitutability,\
    \ supplier\nrelations, and the marketplace; policy questions about\nmainstreaming\
    \ and funding new models of care; professional\nand managerial questions around\
    \ standardization of algorithms\nand protocols; financial questions about who\
    \ pays for which\naspect of a networked service; legal questions around intellectual\n\
    property; regulatory questions about safety, efficacy, and good\nbusiness processes;\
    \ and jurisdictional questions around liability,\nlicensing, and the management\
    \ of health information in shared\nenvironments [108-113]. The industry impetus\
    \ of agile,\nrapid-iteration technology development and the “fail early, fail\n\
    often” principle typically followed for software products\ncontrasts with the\
    \ risk-averse, highly regulated, and randomized\ntrial-dominated context of much\
    \ biomedical innovation\n[11,82,114].\nWhile some implementation frameworks were\
    \ designed around\na rigid (and apparently systematic) logic model [51], we have\n\
    previously argued that such an approach is counterproductive\nbecause eHealth\
    \ technologies are typically introduced into a\ncomplex system in a turbulent\
    \ and contested policy context\n[52]. Complexity principles distinguish simple\
    \ phenomena\n(straightforward, \npredictable, \nfew \ncomponents) \nfrom\ncomplicated\
    \ (multiple interacting components or issues) or\ncomplex (dynamic, unpredictable,\
    \ not easily disaggregated into\nconstituent components) ones [97]. Chambers et\
    \ al’s dynamic\nsustainability framework recognizes that, in order to be\nsustained,\
    \ an innovation must adapt to its unique local\nenvironment and evolve over time\
    \ [115], echoing Hawe et al’s\nconceptualization of interventions as “events in\
    \ [complex]\nsystems” [116]. Several other recently published technology\nimplementation\
    \ frameworks have embraced complexity theory\nand argued strongly for a developmental,\
    \ contextualized, and\nadaptive approach [43,47,53-60].\nAbbott et al [60], for\
    \ example, recommend that because the\n“same” program will play out differently\
    \ in different contexts\n(and in the same context over time), collecting data\
    \ at multiple\nlevels, from multiple sites and longitudinally, will help elucidate\n\
    these contextual influences. Because adaptation is key to\nembedding, inflexible\
    \ milestones and overzealous measures of\nfidelity should be avoided. Local champions\
    \ are likely to be\nkey to participatory and developmental approaches; they should\n\
    be identified early and partnered over time. Also key to the\nachievement of sustainability\
    \ is attention to penetration (the\nextent to which the technology and its use\
    \ become integrated\nwith workflows so that workarounds are no longer necessary).\n\

    \ Their\nholistic technology implementation framework, known as the\nCentre for\
    \ eHealth & Wellbeing Research roadmap, comprises\n5 overlapping stages undertaken\
    \ by a multidisciplinary team\nwith iterative formative evaluation of each: (1)\
    \ contextual\ninquiry (information gathering about the users and the\nenvironment,\
    \ including ethnography and the use of scenarios);\n(2) value specification (including\
    \ economic, social, and\nbehavioral dimensions); (3) design (building prototypes\
    \ that fit\nwith values and user requirements); (4) operationalization\n(introduction\
    \ and employment of the technology, including\nimplementing a business model);\
    \ and (5) summative evaluation\n(of uptake and impact).\nVan Dyk, writing from\
    \ an industrial engineering background,\nproduced a taxonomy of eHealth implementation\
    \ frameworks\nbased on several theories, including diffusion of innovations,\n\
    technology acceptance and use, e-readiness of organizations,\ntransactional economics,\
    \ and the information system life cycle,\nas well as considering more pragmatic\
    \ barriers-and-facilitators\nstudies [59]. She proposed a holistic approach that\
    \ includes\n“technology, organizational structures, change management,\neconomic\
    \ \nfeasibility, \nsocietal \nimpacts, \nperceptions,\nuser-friendliness, evaluation\
    \ and evidence, legislation, policy\nand governance.”\nVan Dyk drew an important\
    \ insight from organizational life\ncycle studies (including her own work on a\
    \ telemedicine service\nmaturity model for health care organizations [58])—that\
    \ the\nchallenges and constraints of technology-supported services\nvary with\
    \ stage of development [59]. That is, (1) at the prototype\nstage, the main emphasis\
    \ is on proof of concept and usability;\n(2) in small-scale pilots, it is on staff\
    \ and societal acceptance\n(typically with an emphasis on the evidence base);\
    \ (3) at the\nstage of wider local rollout—when financial support typically\n\
    moves from external research grant to real set-up costs and a\nrecurrent budget\
    \ line—it is on financial and organizational\nconsiderations; and (4) when being\
    \ considered for national\nrollout, it is on regulation, standardization, and\
    \ security.\nOne final concept, which appears key to organizational\nadaptation\
    \ over time but was not explicitly addressed in any of\nthe previous frameworks,\
    \ is the notion of resilience, defined as\n“the intrinsic ability of a system\
    \ to adjust its functioning prior\nto, during, or following changes and disturbances\
    \ so that it can\nsustain required operations, even after a major mishap or in\
    \ the\npresence \nof \ncontinued \nstress” \n[117]. \nOrganizational\npsychologists\
    \ emphasize the importance of macrocognition:\nthat is, reflecting collectively\
    \ and continuously about how the\norganization is responding to change, including\
    \ ongoing sense\nmaking, detecting critical events, and coordinating adaptive\n\
    actions [118,119]. Introduction of new health care information\ntechnology systems\
    \ can lead to loss of system resilience, since\nnew technologies intended to automate\
    \ work and assure safety\nmay have the unintended effect of reducing time for\n\
    collaborative dialogue, masking key trends in data (perhaps\nthrough information\
    \ overload and loss of overview), making\nwork routines brittle, and bypassing\
    \ clinical judgment [118,120].\nCho et al have warned that the study of resilience\
    \ in relation to\nnew technologies requires multilevel analysis and is fraught\n\
    with paradoxes (eg, that developing resilience in one part of the\nsystem may\
    \ generate brittleness in another) [121].\nIn sum, we found the integrated frameworks\
    \ of van\nGemert-Pijnen et al [43] and Van Dyk [59] extremely helpful\nand used\
    \ them as the starting point for analyzing our own\ndataset, modifying and refining\
    \ them in the light of other\nhigh-quality frameworks published subsequently [53-55,60],\n\
    and adding additional theoretical concepts (eg, burden of\ndisease, health literacy,\
    \ organizational resilience) and insights\nfrom our empirical data (especially\
    \ our findings on the diverse\nand idiosyncratic nature of many conditions, which\
    \ had received\nlittle attention in any previous framework).\nSynthesis: The NASSS\
    \ Framework\nThe final version of the NASSS technology implementation\nframework\
    \ is shown in Figure 2 and expanded in Table 2. It\nconsists of 13 questions in\
    \ 6 domains: the condition, the\ntechnology, the value proposition, the adopter\
    \ system (staff,\npatient, and lay caregiver[s]), the health or care organization(s)\n\
    (including attention to the work of implementation and\nadaptation), and the wider\
    \ (institutional and societal) context.\nIt also includes a seventh domain that\
    \ considers interactions\nand adaptations over time. The framework is intended\
    \ to be\nused reflexively to guide conversations and help generate ideas,\nnot\
    \ as a checklist.\nOur case studies raised a variety of challenges across all\
    \ 7\ndomains, each of which could be classified as simple\n(straightforward, predictable,\
    \ few components), complicated\n(multiple interacting components or issues), or\
    \ complex\n(dynamic, unpredictable, not easily disaggregated into\nconstituent\
    \ components) [97]. Programs characterized by\ncomplicatedness proved difficult\
    \ but not impossible to\nimplement. Those characterized by complexity in multiple\n\
    NASSS domains rarely, if ever, became mainstreamed.\nMultimedia Appendix 2 gives\
    \ examples from our case studies\nin each of the domains, which we consider in\
    \ turn.\nThe Condition\nThis domain addresses the clinical (question 1A) and the\n\
    comorbidities and sociocultural aspects (question 1B) of the\ncondition. It reflects\
    \ the striking finding across all our case\nstudies that only a fraction of potential\
    \ end users were assessed\nby their clinicians as “suitable” for the technology.\
    \ In the\nmajority, the condition was considered clinically high risk,\nunpredictable,\
    \ or atypical (eg, complicated by comorbidities or\nsociocultural factors, especially\
    \ cognitive or health literacy\nconsiderations).\nJ Med Internet Res 2017 | vol.\

    \ adoption, nonadoption, abandonment, spread, scale-up, and sustainability of\n\
    patient-facing health and care technologies.\nThe Technology or Technologies\n\
    Question 2A addresses material and technical features of the\ntechnology. The\
    \ technologies in our case studies were more or\nless freestanding. In all cases,\
    \ features such as size, sounds,\naesthetics, and “clunkiness” had significant\
    \ impact on the\ntechnology’s actual and perceived usability and appropriateness.\n\
    Many were insufficiently prototyped. Dependability of\ntechnologies was key, especially\
    \ in high-risk conditions or social\nsituations.\nQuestion 2B considers the knowledge\
    \ generated or made visible\nby technology. This includes not only the accuracy\
    \ of the data\nbut also the extent to which those data are accepted, trusted,\n\
    and considered sufficient for decision making. Engaging with\nthe data generated\
    \ by patient-facing technologies may inform,\neducate, and empower patients and\
    \ lay caregivers. But data may\nalso be misinterpreted by the patient or cause\
    \ distress.\nQuestion 2C addresses the knowledge and support needed to\nuse the\
    \ technology. Some technologies are much easier to\noperate than others; some\
    \ require frequent troubleshooting; and\nsome assume a different organizational\
    \ role—or even an altered\nprofessional identity—for the user. Some patient-facing\n\
    technologies require no knowledge form the patient; others\nrequire clinical knowledge,\
    \ technical knowledge, and the ability\nto make judgments about (for example)\
    \ what counts as urgent.\nQuestion 2D addresses issues for sustainability raised\
    \ by the\ntechnology supply model—that is, how the technology was\nprocured, the\
    \ nature of the client-supplier relationship, and the\nlevel of potential substitutability\
    \ via the marketplace. The\ntelehealth device marketplace is notorious for its\
    \ lack of\ninteroperability as companies attempt to retain their market\nshare\
    \ through lock-in of customers. The consequences for health\nand social care services—and\
    \ their clients—of market\nwithdrawal could be significant. While procurement\
    \ options\nmay not have immediate impact on scaling up and sustainability,\nthey\
    \ are likely to have significant impact in the long term and\nmay influence decisions\
    \ on whether to adopt an innovation in\nthe first place. Customizable, off-the-shelf\
    \ technologies (COTS)\n[113] offer relatively low cost (as they benefit from economies\n\
    of scale) but may not be customizable to the extent that users\nreally need (see\
    \ domain 1). In contrast, bespoke solutions offer\nbetter fit with users’ needs\
    \ but at higher cost (both\ndevelopmental and ongoing). Both options may be subject\
    \ to\nrisks of supplier withdrawal from the marketplace, with small\nand medium-sized\
    \ enterprises being especially vulnerable.\nThe Value Proposition\nThis domain\
    \ concerns whether a new technology is worth\ndeveloping in the first place—and\
    \ for whom it generates value.\nQuestion 3A addresses upstream value, which follows\
    \ the\nsupply-side logic of financial markets and investment decisions\n(and hence\
    \ depends on preliminary tests of efficacy and safety,\nand evidence of good business\
    \ practice). Question 3B addresses\ndownstream value, which follows the demand-side\
    \ logic of\nhealth technology appraisal, reimbursement, and procurement\n(ie,\
    \ relates to evidence of benefit to patients and real-world\naffordability). As\
    \ Multimedia Appendix 2 illustrates, our dataset\nincluded telling examples of\
    \ mismatch between supply-side\nand demand-side value.\nJ Med Internet Res 2017\

    \ critical events and\nadapting to unforeseen eventuali-\nties?\naCOTS: customizable,\
    \ off-the-shelf.\nThe Adopter System (Staff, Patient, Caregivers)\nQuestion 4A\
    \ is about adoption (and continued use) of the\ntechnology by staff. Reflecting\
    \ the findings of previous studies\nreviewed above, some staff in each of our\
    \ case studies simply\ndid not engage with the program or use the technology.\n\
    Nonadoption (or in some cases, abandonment) of the technology\nwas occasionally\
    \ explained by the technology’s attributes (such\nas usability or ease of use).\
    \ More commonly, staff were\nconcerned about threats to their scope of practice\
    \ or to the safety\nand welfare of the patient—and even, in some cases, about\
    \ a\nfear of job loss.\nQuestion 4B addresses adoption by patients or clients,\
    \ including\nacceptance (hence symbolic meaning and aesthetics) and the\nwork\
    \ required of them.\nQuestion 4C addresses the assumptions that may be built into\n\
    the technology (or the linked service model) about the\navailability and behavior\
    \ of lay caregivers. We encountered\nmany cases of nonuse of all patient-facing\
    \ technologies that\nwere explained by weak or absent social networks, limited\n\
    information technology skills (and distrust of technology) among\nlay caregivers,\
    \ or long-standing family conflicts, which the\ntechnology sometimes brought to\
    \ the surface but never solved\n(see examples in Multimedia Appendix 2).\nThe\
    \ Organization(s)\nQuestions 5A and 5B address the organization’s capacity (to\n\
    embrace any service-level innovation) and readiness (for a\nspecific technology),\
    \ respectively. Our case studies included a\nwide range of antecedent conditions\
    \ and levels of readiness that\ninfluenced uptake and internal scale-up of technology-supported\n\
    programs (see examples in Multimedia Appendix 2).\nQuestion 5C addresses the adoption\
    \ decision, typically a\nboard-level decision to allocate a budget line to support\
    \ a\nparticular technology. Our empirical data indicated three main\nproblems\
    \ with business modeling. The first problem was lack\nof data: it was often impossible\
    \ to predict the uptake, use, and\nimpact of the technology or the amount of investment\
    \ needed\nto get (and keep) it up and running. Predictions were often\nguesstimates\
    \ and typically overoptimistic, for example, in terms\nof numbers of potential\
    \ users and potential costs and efficiency\nsavings. The second problem was lack\
    \ of money to support the\nprogram (see “organizational slack” above). Indeed,\
    \ several\norganizations in our case studies did not appear to even\nrecognize\
    \ the need for a dedicated budget, over and above the\ncost of the technology,\
    \ to support implementation and\nmaintenance. The third problem was interdependencies\
    \ between\norganizations and the teams working within and across them.\nQuestion\
    \ 5D considers the extent to which established work\nroutines will be disrupted\
    \ or made too brittle by the new\ntechnology. In some cases, there will be a transition\
    \ period in\nwhich new collaborative routines linked to the new technology\nwill\
    \ be played out in parallel with existing routines—perhaps\non legacy systems—before\
    \ (hopefully) replacing them.\nThe last question in domain 5 concerns the work\
    \ involved in\nimplementation. All 6 case studies affirmed previous research\n\
    that such work is extensive, often hidden and typically\nunderestimated at the\
    \ planning stage [122]. Our ethnographic\ndata affirmed what Pols and Willems\
    \ showed previously [29]:\nthat technologies must be “tamed” in any particular\
    \ setting by\ncareful attention to the fine-grained detail of context (a process\n\
    Pols and Willems called “tinkering” and Stewart and Williams\ncalled “domesticating”\
    \ [105]). There is also the need for work\non what Weick called sense making [95,103]\
    \ and May and Finch\ncalled “coherence work” [27]: to make collective sense of\
    \ the\ntechnology in the organizational setting and build a shared vision\nof\
    \ its potential (including a realistic assessment of what the\ntechnology cannot\
    \ do).\nJ Med Internet Res 2017 | vol. 19 | iss. 11 | e367 | p. 13\nhttp://www.jmir.org/2017/11/e367/\n\

    \ INTERNET RESEARCH\nXSL•FO\nRenderX\nThe Wider Context\nQuestion 6A relates to\
    \ the wider institutional and sociocultural\ncontext, which in our case studies\
    \ was often key to explaining\nan organization’s failure to move from a successful\n\
    demonstration project (heavily dependent on particular\nchampions and informal\
    \ workarounds) to a fully mainstreamed\nservice (scale-up) that was widely transferable\
    \ (spread) and that\npersisted long term (sustainability). Aspects of wider context\n\
    that proved pivotal in our case studies included health policy\n(including which\
    \ service models were formally approved for\nfunding—see example in Multimedia\
    \ Appendix 2 of the\ndifficulties in securing a nationally approved tariff for\
    \ remote\nconsultations), fiscal policy (the overall amount of funding\navailable\
    \ locally and nationally for health and care provision),\nthe position taken by\
    \ professional bodies and defense societies\n(who de facto defined what was acceptable\
    \ professional\npractice), and legal and regulatory aspects of patient-facing\n\
    technology development.\nInteraction Between Domains and Adaptation Over Time\n\
    While the domains above can be distinguished analytically, the\nreality of any\
    \ technology implementation project is that at an\nempirical level they are inextricably\
    \ interlinked and dynamically\nevolving, often against a rapidly shifting policy\
    \ context or\ncontinued evolution of the technology (and, at an individual\npatient\
    \ level, as the condition deteriorates or fluctuates over\ntime).\nQuestion 7A\
    \ relates to the medium- and long-term feasibility\nof continuing to adapt the\
    \ technology and the program. Some\ntechnologies were more amenable to adaptation\
    \ than others.\nAdaptation of staff roles and care pathways was also difficult\n\
    when organizations were in subcontractor relationships\n(sometimes with private\
    \ providers).\nQuestion 7B concerns organizational resilience, and particularly\n\
    what May and Finch called “reflexive monitoring” [27] and\nPatterson et al called\
    \ the “macrocognitive functions” of sense\nmaking, including in particular the\
    \ ability to detect critical\nevents or issues and respond to these through coordinated\
    \ action\n[118].\nWhile an adaptive and reflexive approach is essential for\n\
    effective scale-up, spread, and sustainability, it is impossible\nto be prescriptive\
    \ at the outset as to how to go about this. Both\nformative and summative evaluation\
    \ of the program’s success\nwill need to use imagination and multiple methods,\
    \ along with\na narrative account of what happened and why, in order to\ncapture\
    \ its multiple interdependencies, nonlinear effects, and\nunintended consequences\
    \ [123].\nResults of Prospectively Testing the NASSS\nFramework\nColleagues found\
    \ our near-final NASSS framework helpful in\nconsidering challenges to implementation\
    \ of a range of\ntechnology-supported health or care programs. While some used\n\
    the framework (as we ourselves did) prospectively and in real\ntime to predict\
    \ and explore the challenges of implementing an\nexisting technology to support\
    \ a new program, some used it\nretrospectively to explain failures and partial\
    \ successes in past\nprojects. One group (a design company) suggested that the\n\
    NASSS framework might be used at an early (design) stage to\nfocus attention first\
    \ on the condition and adopter system domains\n(ie, the needs of intended users),\
    \ which would then inform both\nthe technology and value proposition domains.\n\
    Discussion\nPrincipal Results\nBuilding on previous work by other groups, this\
    \ study has\ndeveloped and applied a new framework for predicting and\nevaluating\
    \ the success of technology-supported health and social\ncare programs. Across\
    \ a diverse sample of 6 empirical case\nstudies followed (so far) for up to 3\
    \ years and tested briefly (for\nwhat might be called face validity) in a further\
    \ sample of 10\nadditional case studies, we identified and explained numerous\n\
    examples of nonadoption and abandonment of the technology\nby individuals or limited\
    \ success in attempts to scale up, spread,\nand sustain the program within and\
    \ beyond the organization.\nA striking finding that explained many such instances\
    \ was a\ntendency to assume that the issues to be addressed were simple\nor complicated\
    \ (hence knowable, predictable, and controllable)\nrather than complex (that is,\
    \ inherently not knowable or\npredictable but dynamic and emergent). Common problems\n\
    included the following:\n•\nThe technology and linked program had been designed\n\
    around an oversimplified, textbook model of the condition.\n•\nThe technology\
    \ was insufficiently prototyped, insufficiently\ncustomizable, insufficiently\
    \ dependable, dependent on\ncomplex knowledge to use it, or designed to generate\
    \ data\nor knowledge that was incomplete, inappropriate, or\ncontested in the\
    \ care context.\n•\nThe value proposition of the technology was unclear, in\n\
    terms of a viable business venture for its developer or in\nterms of a clear benefit\
    \ for patients and an affordable\nreal-world service model.\n•\nThe intended users\
    \ of the technology had plausible personal\nor professional reasons to resist\
    \ or reject it.\n•\nThe organization(s) were inadequately set up for innovation,\n\
    not ready for (or interested in) this particular innovation,\nunable to negotiate\
    \ a viable business model with partner\norganizations, unable to shift to new\
    \ ways of working, or\nunable to support the extensive work needed to implement\n\
    and sustain the change (including the rhetorical “work” of\nmaking sense of an\
    \ equivocal technology).\n•\nComplexity in external (financial, regulatory, legal,\
    \ policy)\nissues—of which reimbursement seemed to be particularly\nkey—stalled\
    \ the mainstreaming and spread of the program.\n•\nThe program was unable to adapt\
    \ and evolve over time in\na way that continued to meet the needs of its intended\
    \ users\nand remain clinically, operationally, and financially viable.\nStrengths\
    \ and Limitations\nThe NASSS framework has been developed systematically to\n\
    fill \na \nkey \ngap \nin \nthe \nliterature \non \ntechnology\nimplementation—specifically,\
    \ to address not just adoption but\nalso nonadoption and abandonment of technologies\

    \ and part of business\nas usual locally (scale-up), transferable to new settings\
    \ (spread),\nand maintained long term through adaptation to context over\ntime\
    \ (sustainability).\nNASSS was never intended to provide a simple fix for complex\n\
    problems. It cannot be applied in a formulaic way or used\ndeterministically as\
    \ a tool, nor do we believe it is possible to\nmake firm predictions about which\
    \ elements of the framework\nwill be mission-critical or how the different elements\
    \ will\ninteract (since these are likely to differ substantially in different\n\
    cases and settings). With these caveats, we believe that, subject\nto further\
    \ empirical testing, the NASSS diagram in Figure 2\nand the NASSS domains and\
    \ questions in Table 2 have several\npotential uses. In particular, they could\
    \ be used (1) at an early\nstage in a technology development to inform technology\
    \ and\nservice design; (2) in strategic planning to identify technological\ninnovations\
    \ that (perhaps despite policy enthusiasm) have\nlimited chance of achieving large-scale,\
    \ sustained adoption; (3)\nin technology implementation projects to address the\
    \ micro-level\nchallenges of individual adoption, the meso-level challenges of\n\
    organizational assimilation, and the macro-level challenges of\nthe policy and\
    \ regulatory environment; (4) to inform and support\nscale-up and rollout of technology\
    \ programs; and (5)\nretrospectively to explain program failures.\nThe empirical\
    \ work to develop NASSS was based entirely in\nthe United Kingdom, although collaborators\
    \ who peer reviewed\nand tested the draft framework included groups from Australia,\n\
    Canada, Italy, and the United States. The 6 case studies\npresented in this paper\
    \ have been followed for up to 3 years;\nfield work is ongoing, so additional\
    \ insights about long-term\nsustainability may emerge in the future. We strongly\
    \ encourage\nother research groups to explore the applicability of the\nframework\
    \ for different purposes and to adapt and extend it if\nappropriate.\nComparison\
    \ With Previous Work\nPrevious technology implementation frameworks identified\
    \ in\nour hermeneutic review of the literature are summarized in\nMultimedia Appendix\
    \ 1; the approaches and limitations of those\nframeworks are described in the\
    \ Results section. We selected\n2 rigorously developed, multilevel, integrative\
    \ frameworks as\nmost closely fitting our own empirical data [43,59] and have\n\
    built on these in three main ways.\nFirst, we have added a preliminary focus on\
    \ the illness or\ncondition for which the technology is assumed to be a solution,\n\
    an emphasis that emerged from our empirical data but probably\nalso reflects the\
    \ background of several authors as clinicians,\npsychologists, or patient-facing\
    \ service coordinators. Second,\nwe have introduced the heuristic of classifying\
    \ each domain of\ninterest as simple, complicated, or complex, and cautiously\n\
    concluded that it is complexity in multiple domains that poses\nthe greatest challenge\
    \ to scale-up, spread, and sustainability.\nThird, while acknowledging our academic\
    \ audiences and not\nwishing to oversimplify a problem that is inherently complex,\n\
    we have produced a visual representation of the different NASSS\ndomains that\
    \ we hope will be accessible to key nonacademic\naudiences: clinicians, managers,\
    \ technology developers,\nexecutive decision makers in health and care organizations,\
    \ and\npatients and caregivers.\nConclusions\nImplementing new technologies as\
    \ part of changes to health\nand social care services is inherently challenging.\
    \ While policy\nmakers are calling for technology to be implemented rapidly\n\
    and at scale, the reality is that when dealing with the multiple\ncomplexities\
    \ of health and care, it is extremely difficult to go\nbeyond small-scale demonstration\
    \ projects. We hope that the\nNASSS framework will help implementation teams—and,\
    \ at\nan earlier stage, technology and service designers—to identify,\nunderstand,\
    \ and address the interacting challenges to achieving\nsustained adoption, local\
    \ scale-up, distant spread, and long-term\nsustainability of their programs.\n\
    While we believe that the NASSS framework is academically\ndefensible, additional\
    \ work is now ongoing to make it accessible\nto its intended users beyond academia.\
    \ In the United Kingdom,\nthe NHS National Technology Adoption Centre (NTAC) was\n\
    set up in 2007 to promote the uptake of health technologies\nthrough its Technology\
    \ Implementation Projects and\nHowToWhyTo guides (which attempt to distil lessons\
    \ learned\nfrom pilots in a format designed to be easily transferable and\nhence\
    \ reusable). One of the principal objectives of the guides\nhas been to assist\
    \ practitioner stakeholders to build a business\ncase for innovation. However,\
    \ a recent study suggests that their\nimpact has been disappointing and points\
    \ to the difficulties of\nmaking context-specific knowledge transferable and hence\n\
    reusable in other contexts [124]. Cognizant of this, we are\ncurrently working\
    \ with design colleagues to develop and\nevaluate accessible infographic summaries,\
    \ Web tools, and team\nlearning opportunities based on the NASSS framework for\n\
    different audiences.\nAcknowledgments\nWe are grateful to the participants (patients,\

    \ replicating the characteristics and functionalities\nof tangible objects, processes,\
    \ or systems within the digital space, leveraging their capability to\nsimulate\
    \ and forecast real-world behavior. They have found valuable applications in smart\
    \ farming,\nfacilitating a comprehensive virtual replica of a farm that encompasses\
    \ vital aspects such as crop\ncultivation, soil composition, and prevailing weather\
    \ conditions. By amalgamating data from diverse\nsources, including soil, plants\
    \ condition, environmental sensor networks, meteorological predictions,\nand high-resolution\
    \ UAV and Satellite imagery, farmers gain access to dynamic and up-to-date\nvisualization\
    \ of their agricultural domains empowering them to make well-informed and timely\n\
    choices concerning critical aspects like efﬁcient irrigation plans, optimal fertilization\
    \ methods, and\neffective pest management strategies, enhancing overall farm productivity\
    \ and sustainability. This\nresearch paper aims to present a comprehensive overview\
    \ of the contemporary state of research\non digital twins in smart farming, including\
    \ crop modelling, precision agriculture, and associated\ntechnologies, while exploring\
    \ their potential applications and their impact on agricultural practices,\naddressing\
    \ the challenges and limitations such as data privacy concerns, the need for high-quality\n\
    data for accurate simulations and predictions, and the complexity of integrating\
    \ multiple data sources.\nLastly, the paper explores the prospects of digital\
    \ twins in agriculture, highlighting potential avenues\nfor future research and\
    \ advancement in this domain.\nKeywords: digital twins; smart agriculture-farming;\

    Digital Twins (DTs) have successfully entered industrial applications, including\
    \ aerospace,\nmanufacturing, and healthcare [1–3]. Smart farming, on the other\
    \ hand, which employs\nthe latest technological innovations to optimize crop production,\
    \ is revolutionizing the\nagriculture industry. As virtual replicas of physical\
    \ objects or systems, DTs represent a\nhighly promising advancement in this ﬁeld\
    \ [4]. In smart farming, digital twins enable\nagriculture experts, researchers,\
    \ and farmers to simulate various scenarios, test different\nstrategies, and predict\
    \ outcomes accurately. DTs in smart farming offer transformative\npossibilities,\
    \ revolutionizing crop cultivation and management while enabling optimization\n\
    of resource utilization, minimizing environmental footprint, and enhancing crop\
    \ yields for\na sustainable and efﬁcient agricultural ecosystem.\nHowever, despite\
    \ the signiﬁcant promise of digital twins in smart farming, many\nquestions and\

    \ in recent years, moving toward inno-\nvative technologies, particularly with\
    \ the explosion of precision agriculture and other digital\ntechnologies [5].\
    \ These technologies help farmers make more informed decisions about crop\nmanagement,\
    \ soil health, and various factors inﬂuencing crop yields and economic viability,\n\
    enhancing overall agricultural productivity and proﬁtability. However, these technologies\n\

    \ hardware,\nsoftware, and other infrastructural resources. Additionally, factors\
    \ such as climate change,\nchanging consumer preferences, and market ﬂuctuations\
    \ can add to the complexity of\nmodern farming. While these challenges can make\
    \ farming more complicated, they also\noffer opportunities for innovation and\
    \ growth in the agriculture domain.\nIn this era of smart farming, the incorporation\
    \ of cutting-edge technologies such\nas computing, communication, personal and\

    \ and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) has revolutionized\nthe landscape in agriculture.\
    \ These technologies bring additional capabilities beyond the\nphysical realm,\
    \ allowing for enhanced information and an improved understanding of\nthe physical\

    comprehensive and accurate information about physical systems, surpassing the\
    \ limita-\ntions of traditional modelling and simulation approaches. By leveraging\
    \ real-time data\ncollection, processing, and analysis, DTs offer a digital representation\

    \ and soil models, and explore\nhow they optimize crop production. We also examine\
    \ the challenges and limitations\nof deploying DTs in smart farming related to\
    \ data management, model accuracy, and\nscalability. By providing a comprehensive\
    \ review of the literature on DTs in smart farming,\nthis paper aims to advance\
    \ the understanding of this rapidly evolving ﬁeld, illustrate the\ngaps in existing\

    We proceeded with our research by pursuing the formulation of the DT implementa-\n\
    tion architecture regarding the smart agriculture domain while emphasizing the\
    \ critical\ncomponents taking part in implementing DTs. A comparative accumulation\
    \ of such im-\nplementations and critical components in three tables, while addressing\
    \ technical aspects,\nled to signiﬁcant conclusions regarding DT implementations\
    \ and related limitations that\nseem beneﬁcial to investigate. For example, although\
    \ the necessity of a DT model and\npractical implementations in agriculture is\
    \ addressed in most reviewed papers mentioning\nthe concept and deﬁnition, the\
    \ DT model is proposed merely as an evolving concept lacking\nsubstantial support\
    \ from implemented case studies. While the DTs seem continuously\nevolving, authors\
    \ refer to simulation models merely as proposals for future practical im-\nplementation.\
    \ Our research seeks to expand the scope of Agriculture 4.0 that necessitates\n\
    DTs and address the limitations of IoT-implemented solutions narrowed down by\
    \ mere\ntelemetry implementations.\nThe structure of this study proceeds as follows:\

    \ of a DT scheme’s dynamic integration of physical and digital domains.\nAccording\
    \ to Dyck G. et al. [9], the concept of DTs emerged from NASA’s pioneering\nwork\
    \ in integrating physical models and simulations [10,11] to analyze intricate\
    \ systems.\nOriginally conﬁned to the aerospace sector, the scope of DTs expanded\
    \ to encompass\nproduct lifecycle management across diverse industries. At its\
    \ core, as initially proposed\nSensors 2023, 23, 7128\n4 of 38\nby Grieves & Vickers\
    \ [6,7,12], a DT comprises a physical object, its corresponding digi-\ntal representation,\
    \ and the interconnectedness between the two that it is established for\nboth\
    \ ways.\nOngoing research continues to explore the wide-ranging applications and\
    \ integration\nas interfaces of the DTs in areas such as cloud manufacturing,\
    \ IoT, and Industry 4.0,\nwhere explicitly stated that the provided response is\
    \ a unique formulation based on the\ngiven information [13,14].\nHence, DTs serve\
    \ as virtual counterparts of real-world entities, created using sensor\ndata and\
    \ serving as dynamic representations of physical objects or systems throughout\n\
    various stages of their lifecycle. By harnessing the power of simulation and data\
    \ integration,\nDTs provide a comprehensive virtual environment that mirrors the\
    \ characteristics and\nbehaviour of their physical counterparts. This enables\
    \ continuous real-time monitoring,\nanalysis, and enhancement of the physical\
    \ objects or systems, resulting in enhanced perfor-\nmance, efﬁciency, and informed\
    \ decision-making, as stated by Saddik et al. in 2018 [1].\nDTs utilize actual\
    \ data from real-life situations, machine learning (ML) models, and\nsimulation\
    \ combined with data analysis to enhance comprehension, learning, and decision-\n\
    making processes. They enable the monitoring and control of various entities,\
    \ including\ndevices, machines, vehicles, and individuals. The proliferation of\
    \ the IoT has spurred\nthe advancement of diverse DT solutions across diverse\
    \ domains and use cases support-\ning simulation, optimization, and prediction.\
    \ Thus, major improvement steps have been\ntaken in the realm of decision-making\
    \ so that various sectors, including manufacturing,\nhealthcare, and smart cities,\
    \ have witnessed signiﬁcant advancements facilitated by di-\nverse technologies\
    \ like simulation software, IoT, and AI utilized in the ﬁeld of modelling\nand\
    \ simulation [4,13,15,16].\nTo simulate and model the physical system to succeed\
    \ in implementing the DTs, the\nuse of mathematical models is mandatory [17].\
    \ Once the observed physical phenomena of\ninterest are captured, foundational\
    \ mathematical equations are formulated to depict and\ncharacterize the dynamics\
    \ of these phenomena accurately. By constructing these mathemat-\nical models,\
    \ researchers and scientists can effectively represent and analyze the behavior\n\
    and relationships inherent in the observed physical phenomena. The models that\
    \ are\ndeveloped need to be validated by experimental stages on the ﬁeld or in\
    \ laboratory setups\nto verify the physical behavior of the problem under consideration\
    \ soundly. Therefore,\nin advanced DTs, a predominant trend is the utilization\
    \ of extensive datasets to establish\ndata-driven models. This approach operates\
    \ under the assumption that the data obtained\nfrom the system serves as a powerful\
    \ source of insight, offering profound revelations about\nits physical behavior.\
    \ As a result, these well-reﬁned DTs leverage the abundance of data\nto construct\
    \ accurate and thorough models that faithfully capture the intricacies of the\n\
    system’s behavior [18]. The interaction of data between the physical entity and\
    \ its digital\nrepresentation in a DT is visually depicted in Figure 2.\nBy using\
    \ AI tools, such as ML algorithms or artiﬁcial neural networks, or while\nutilizing\

    \ Adopting semantic\ntechnologies such as ontologies and knowledge graphs is crucial\
    \ to address this issue, as\nthey offer promising solutions for achieving greater\
    \ alignment and interoperability.\nCloud computing [13] has emerged as a critical\
    \ solution for the complex task of pro-\ncessing vast amounts of data in various\
    \ sectors, particularly in conjunction with the advent\nof the Industrial IoT\
    \ (IIoT). The IIoT, a subset of the IoT speciﬁcally designed for industrial\n\
    applications, involves deploying numerous smart devices within industrial systems\
    \ to\nenable real-time data processing after collection and sensing. Given the\
    \ nature of industrial\nenvironments, IIoT systems demand enhanced levels of secure\
    \ and robust communication\nto ensure optimal production performance [22]. IIoT\
    \ applications that connect machines,\nsensors, and actuators like data collected\
    \ from agriculture stakeholders to be combined for\neffective decision-making\
    \ and analysis of future trends occasionally produce a large volume\nof non-uniform\
    \ data that needs to be processed in real-time. IoT gateways that provide\nconnectivity\
    \ between one or more ﬁeld devices and a service cloud offer accessibility to\n\
    previously hidden data from sensors, embedded controllers and IO devices and analyze\n\
    such data for multiple purposes, such as remote monitoring, preventive maintenance,\n\
    production optimization and building automation. IoT gateways are critical to\
    \ ensure data\nsecurity and communication security within the IIoT systems. A\
    \ data breach in such IIoT\nsystems could compromise agricultural production,\
    \ i.e., crop health degradation, transport\nand product processing, leading to\
    \ inferior production performance [23].\nThe exponential growth of IIoT and its\
    \ associated technologies has signiﬁcantly con-\ntributed to the advancement of\
    \ Industry 4.0 and intelligent manufacturing, forming the\nunderlying framework\
    \ for CDT. The substantial amount of data induced by IIoT devices\nplay a vital\
    \ role in facilitating the development of data-centric services as a crucial ele-\n\
    ment. While the concept of CDT continues to evolve rapidly, it is imperative to\
    \ address\noutstanding concerns surrounding the technology to unlock its full\
    \ potential and achieve\nits envisioned advantages.\nCDT systems integrate data\
    \ from different stakeholders as they combine several\nparameters, mainly concerning\
    \ immense amounts of data sharing, demanding measures\nto ensure security, privacy,\
    \ and protection of intellectual property (IP) concerning data.\nCDTs incorporate\
    \ cybersecurity infrastructure and employ data encryption mechanisms\nto address\
    \ these critical aspects effectively. These measures are implemented to regulate\n\
    transparency in CDTs, ensure the protection of intellectual property (IP), and\
    \ facilitate\nintegrated development processes [8,24].\nSimilarly, the notion\
    \ of DT systems emerges as a virtual representation of an enter-\nprise, encompassing\
    \ its resources, processes, workforce, locations, and systems to support\nstrategic\
    \ decision-making from the systems used for reporting operational data within\
    \ the\norganization, such as accounting, personnel planning, and sales [25]. This\
    \ type of DT which\nretrieves real-time data from the systems used for reporting\
    \ operational data within an\norganization, as mentioned earlier, is referred\
    \ to as a Strategic DT (SDT), in contrast to the\nindustrial DT that gathers information\
    \ from sensors, serving as a knowledge visualization\ntool that allows managers\
    \ to explore various strategies while minimizing space and time\nconstraints.\
    \ By simulating different strategic options through computer models, managers\n\
    can gain insights into the potential outcomes of their chosen approaches in the\
    \ real world.\nSensors 2023, 23, 7128\n7 of 38\n2.2. DTs in Agriculture\nAs stated\
    \ above, the implementation of DTs seems to extend to various ﬁelds vastly.\n\
    The objective of this review is to illuminate the ﬁeld of agriculture in the following\
    \ manner.\nA DT for agriculture, in particular, may be addressed as a virtual\
    \ model of a physical\nfarm or agricultural operation constructed utilizing cutting-edge\
    \ technologies like sensors,\nIoT devices, and cloud computing. Farmers can utilize\
    \ the DT to simulate and enhance\ntheir farming methods within a virtual setting,\
    \ enabling them to reﬁne their practices before\napplying them in reality [26,27].\
    \ Pylianidis et al. [27] conducted an in-depth report on DTs\nin agriculture,\
    \ encompassing 28 case studies and organizing the key value-added features\nof\
    \ DTs in agricultural applications. The authors highlight the capacity of DT usage\
    \ in\nagriculture, adjusting to ever-evolving circumstances, capturing, and interpreting\
    \ data,\nautonomously managing system actuators in the ﬁeld, and delivering customized\
    \ services\nto individuals, such as reports and transparent information. The DT\
    \ enables capturing\nreal-time data on crop growth rates, weather conditions,\
    \ ambient temperatures, and even\nsoil moisture levels as various environmental\
    \ and operational factors. A dynamic model of\nthe farm may be created by using\
    \ this data to test different scenarios and optimize various\naspects of the farming\
    \ operation, including crop yields, resource utilization, and overall efﬁ-\nciency.\
    \ By creating a DT, farmers can better understand how their farming practices\
    \ impact\nthe environment and identify ways to reduce waste and improve sustainability.\
    \ They can\nalso use the DT to test new technologies and techniques, such as precision\
    \ agriculture and\nautomation, before investing in them for their physical operation.\

    \ Farmers can effectively observe and evaluate alterations\nin agricultural land,\
    \ impacting soil, irrigation, and crop yield. IoT technology provides\nreal-time\
    \ data and visual representations for informed decision-making [29].\nThe overall\
    \ efﬁciency of crop production can be improved by reducing costs associated\n\
    with fuel, fertilizers, labor, and factors affecting production efﬁciency and\
    \ sustainability\nmerely by utilizing DTs in crop production technologies along\
    \ with the use of Digital\nInformation and Communication Technology (ICT) tools,\
    \ referring to agricultural pieces of\nmachinery, such as tractors, combined harvesters,\
    \ fertilizers, and sprayers.\nAccording to Dyck G et al. [9], the DTs seem to\
    \ ﬁnd their way in post-harvest processes,\nencompassing the various stages involved\
    \ in handling agricultural products after harvest-\ning. These products must be\
    \ dried, cooled, transported, stored, and undergo marketing\nprocedures. Digital\
    \ farming methods provide advantages in post-harvest procedures, such\nas minimizing\
    \ losses, optimizing food processing, improving storage conditions, stream-\n\
    lining transportation, and enhancing marketing efﬁciency. These strategies facilitate\
    \ the\nlive tracking of the agricultural and food supply network, leading to increased\
    \ robustness,\nresilience and reduced food waste and losses.\nIoT technology following\
    \ the digitalization prospect of agriculture plays a crucial role\nin transforming\
    \ traditional agriculture into a more efﬁcient and sustainable practice. IoT\n\
    contextual data enables users to interact seamlessly with their surroundings and\
    \ remote lo-\ncations through their digital twin, fostering enhanced connectivity\
    \ and user experiences [1].\nFacts such as precision agriculture that enables\
    \ farmers to gather real-time data on\na range of environmental and operational\
    \ factors, predictive modelling by using both\nhistorical and real-time data so\
    \ that they can generate a dynamic virtual representation of\ntheir agricultural\
    \ operation, sustainability, and automation to identify ways to reduce waste\n\
    and improve sustainability in farming operations [30] in accordance to real-time\
    \ data, focus\non addressing critical IoT needs such as two-way communication,\
    \ comprehensive security\nmeasures, localization, and mobility services to optimize\
    \ its efﬁciency and effectiveness [31].\nIn addition, DTs seem to pose a signiﬁcant\
    \ role in animal farming or precision livestock\nfarming by enhancing productivity,\
    \ animal welfare, and overall farm management. They\ncan be used to create virtual\
    \ representations of individual animals, groups of animals, or\nentire livestock\
    \ production systems [32], to model and predict animal behavior, growth,\nand\
    \ health, allowing farmers to optimize feeding strategies, detect early signs\
    \ of disease or\ndistress, and improve overall animal welfare.\nThrough data-driven\
    \ insights and predictive analytics, farmers can make informed\ndecisions regarding\
    \ nutrition, breeding, and healthcare interventions. By incorporating\nup-to-the-minute\
    \ information gathered from diverse sources, including sensors, monitoring\ndevices,\
    \ and agricultural management systems, DTs enable farmers to monitor, simulate,\n\
    and analyze animal behavior, health, and performance.\nNeethirajan S. [33] presents\
    \ a DT processing pipeline with sensors to classify and esti-\nmate livestock’s\
    \ emotional state and behavior. Various means of communication, including\nvocalizations,\
    \ body movements, facial expressions, and posture, contribute to animals\nexpressing\
    \ their emotional state. The review presents novel approaches for gathering\n\
    extensive real-time data regarding the emotions of farm livestock by implementing\
    \ a sensor\ndata processing pipeline within the DT model. This pipeline involves\
    \ preliminary data\nprocessing, modelling, and simulation phases, ultimately resulting\
    \ in reporting and pre-\ndicting the emotional states of cattle based on their\
    \ tail movements, facial expressions, and\nbody posture. Traditional methods involving\
    \ blood sampling or surveys, for assessing the\nemotional states of livestock\
    \ usually cause interruptions to farming processes while being\ntime-consuming,\
    \ and farm animals frequently experience fear, frustration, and distress. AI\n\
    technologies facilitate the recognition of cattle states, empowering animal caregivers\
    \ and\nethologists to understand animal behavior and optimize their well-being\
    \ and productivity.\nSensors 2023, 23, 7128\n9 of 38\nDTs may support decision-making\
    \ and farm management optimization by simulating\ndifferent scenarios regarding\
    \ environmental conditions or genetic factors on animal perfor-\nmance and production\
    \ outcomes while improving production efﬁciency and minimizing\nenvironmental\
    \ impacts. Furthermore, connections with other digital platforms, such as\nfarm\
    \ management systems, supply chain networks, and veterinary databases, allowing\
    \ for\nseamless data sharing and analysis is feasible with DT, thus enhancing\
    \ traceability, quality\nassurance, and decision-making throughout the value chain.\n\
    In summary, digital twins have the potential to revolutionize animal farming by\n\
    providing real-time monitoring, predictive analytics, and decision support. They\
    \ can\noptimize animal health, welfare, and production efﬁciency while promoting\
    \ sustainable\nfarming practices. Continued research and development in this area\
    \ will be crucial to fully\nharness the beneﬁts of DTs in animal farming and address\
    \ the associated challenges.\nAn Aquaculture 4.0 architecture of a digital twin-based\
    \ intelligent ﬁsh farm man-\nagement system for precision aquaculture is discussed\
    \ in [34], addressing the design\nconsiderations, data integration, analytics,\
    \ and control mechanisms to optimize ﬁsh farm\noperations. The proposed implementation\
    \ utilizes a cloud-based DT technology employing\nML realizations, computer vision,\
    \ and other sensor devices, and AI-based IoT (AIoT) to\nmonitor and control automated\
    \ aquaculture machinery. By optimizing farm production\nin various environments\
    \ throughout the different stages of ﬁsh farming, the system aims\nto maximize\
    \ efﬁciency and productivity. Water quality sensors utilized in ﬁshponds to\n\
    monitor and analyze the condition of the water and in offshore sea cages, and\
    \ RGB or sonar\ncamera devices may collect environmental data and data related\
    \ to ﬁsh populations to es-\ntablish data-driven prediction models. On the other\
    \ hand, land-based monitoring systems\nsend appropriate commands to activate surveillance\
    \ sensors, thus enabling ﬁsh-feeding\nbehavior monitoring, disease spread, and\
    \ ﬁsh population growth.\nFurthermore, DTs address optimization solutions regarding\
    \ water ﬂow and treatment\nprocesses related to water quality reduction following\
    \ ﬂoods and stormwater within trans-\nboundary water security projects due to\
    \ urban expansion [17]. DT models are employed\nto monitor the quality of urban\
    \ water by integrating physical entities and utilizing sen-\nsors in urban drainage\
    \ systems. The models consider natural processes related to soil,\nvegetation,\
    \ clogging, and biological activity in water treatment. This approach enables\n\
    comprehensive monitoring and analysis of urban water systems for effective management\n\
    and maintenance.\n3. Reviewing Relevant Technologies and DT Components\nAlthough\

    \ modelling,\nsimulation, analytics, decision support, visualization, and control,\
    \ ultimately aiding in\noptimizing farm operations and improving decision-making\
    \ processes.\nFurthermore, the interconnections among these entities play a vital\
    \ role as they are\nessential for the functioning of the DT system in an integrated\
    \ manner, as emphasized by\nPedersen et al. in their research [17].\n3.1. Technologies\
    \ Involved in DTs\nTherefore, realizing DTs in real-time is characterized by several\
    \ deﬁning keys that have\nemerged along with key technologies [1] from various\
    \ domains, industries, and scientiﬁc\ndisciplines that pose a decisive entity,\
    \ such as the following.\n3.1.1. Augmented, Virtual, and Mixed-Reality\nDTs rely\
    \ on Augmented (AR), Virtual (VR), and Mixed-Reality (MR) technologies. As\nan\
    \ example, they can be created using three-dimensional (3D) technologies and presented\n\
    as holograms or experienced through AR/VR/MR devices [35], such as the Microsoft\n\
    HoloLens. Using sensors installed in the ﬁeld, their real-time digital twin can\
    \ be generated\nand projected as a hologram in remote locations. This enables\
    \ individuals in different\nlocations to engage in interactions that simulate\
    \ being physically present in the same space.\nCommunication enhancement in digital\
    \ twins is derived by integrating tactile feedback,\nsimulating the sensation\
    \ of physical interaction via haptics. Furthermore, DTs can leverage\nhumanoid\
    \ and soft robotics technologies to enable physical actions on behalf of their\
    \ real-\nlife counterparts. This means digital twins can physically engage with\
    \ the environment\nor perform tasks, utilizing robotic systems that mimic human-like\
    \ or ﬂexible movements.\nThese advancements in augmented, virtual, mixed reality,\
    \ haptics, and robotics greatly en-\nhance the capabilities of digital twins,\
    \ enabling immersive interactions, realistic sensations,\nand physical engagement,\
    \ expanding the possibilities for communication and collaboration.\nSensors 2023,\
    \ 23, 7128\n11 of 38\n3.1.2. Artiﬁcial Intelligence\nArtiﬁcial Intelligence (AI)\
    \ integration into physical assets that lack it inherently is a\nkey advantage\
    \ of DTs. This introduces a specialized intelligence capable of efﬁciently com-\n\
    prehending vast amounts of numerical data and deriving domain-speciﬁc insights\
    \ faster\nthan human experts. Consequently, the data obtained from the digital\
    \ twin’s surroundings\nand physical counterpart should lead to valuable and actionable\
    \ conclusions [36]. As an\nemerging technology, AI empowers computers to exhibit\
    \ intelligent behaviors, including\nbehavioral learning. By amalgamating various\
    \ technologies, including AI, to create twin\nmodels of physical objects, it becomes\
    \ feasible to generate virtual representations that\nclosely resemble the original\
    \ objects, encompassing historical elements and predictive\ninformation [37].\
    \ As a result, DTs often incorporate controllers that utilize ontologies, ML,\n\
    and deep learning (DL) techniques. These controllers enable swift and intelligent\
    \ decision-\nmaking on behalf of their real-life counterparts. Moreover, AI signiﬁcantly\
    \ processes IoT\ndata through continuously enhanced algorithms that leverage updated\
    \ user data. Leverag-\ning such time-series data, a user’s DT has the potential\
    \ to suggest actions for controlling or\nmitigating potentially hazardous situations\
    \ regarding crop health and productivity, in cases\nsuch as droughts to direct\
    \ asses irrigation efﬁciency or even failures of safety mechanisms\nof farm machinery,\
    \ plant production equipment, post-harvest transportation or storage\nequipment\
    \ situations in which DTs may visualize alarm signals to stakeholders or even\
    \ take\nimmediate actions to limit adverse effects or even the destruction of\
    \ crop production [29].\n3.1.3. Communication Technologies and Schemes\nDTs rely\
    \ on communication technologies and schemes to facilitate interaction with the\n\
    environment, their physical twins, and other DTs on a real-time basis. This is\
    \ particularly\nsigniﬁcant in the realm of wireless communication. Effective communication\
    \ must occa-\nsionally occur within a millisecond (ms) timeframe, necessitating\
    \ compliance with 5G and\ntactile internet standards, while time-sensitive and\
    \ safety-critical schemes, coupled with\nthe need for stringent communication\
    \ standards, lead to a growing demand for repeatable\nand cost-effective veriﬁcation\
    \ procedures. Data transmission within a speciﬁc time window\nbecomes crucial\
    \ for time-sensitive and often safety-critical applications, imposing latency\n\
    limitations in addition to reliability requirements [38]. The following paragraphs\
    \ outline\nbasic wireless communications technologies commonly used in DT implementations.\n\
    (a)\nRFID technology offers fast and accurate object identiﬁcation using sensor\
    \ tags, reader\nantennas, and a host system. An antenna, an integrated circuit,\
    \ and a substrate utilize\na tag, where the antenna activates the tag for reading\
    \ or writing. The reader antennas\ncommunicate with the tags using RF waves, facilitating\
    \ data transfer to the database\nsystem. This technology ﬁnds extensive applications\
    \ in storage and inventory man-\nagement, supply chain monitoring, access control,\
    \ aviation transportation, agriculture,\nhealthcare, and more, improving efﬁciency\
    \ and automation in various ﬁelds [39].\n(b)\nWireless Networks, in particular,\
    \ suggest an immense role in sending data from\na source to a connected gateway,\
    \ a role supported by a variety of wireless net-\nwork technologies such as WPAN,\
    \ WLAN, WWAN, and LPWAN that are addressed\nin [18,39–47]. The existing commercial\
    \ 4G or 5G LTE communication networks, utiliz-\ning the transmission of data packets\
    \ through the well-established Internet Protocol\n(IP), serves as a base to sustain\
    \ the architecture of wireless communication networks\nin general.\ni\nWireless\
    \ Personal Area Networks (WPAN) are wireless networks that operate\nwith less\
    \ extensive infrastructure. They are designed to function within a\nlimited range,\
    \ typically within a single room or a small area. Unlike traditional\nnetworks\
    \ that rely on cables, WPANs enable the wireless connectivity of de-\nvices nearby,\
    \ facilitating the connection of devices like wireless keyboards or\nmice to computers\
    \ and supporting printing services. The most common WPAN\ntechnologies include\
    \ Bluetooth, 6LowWPAN, ZigBee, EnOcean, NFC, and\nRFID, each employing different\
    \ techniques to achieve the goals of WPAN [40].\nSensors 2023, 23, 7128\n12 of\
    \ 38\nBluetooth enables devices to communicate with each other wirelessly within\
    \ a\nlimited proximity. It is a short-range, low-power technology that is used\
    \ in a\nwide variety of devices [41].\nii\nWireless Local Area Networks (WLAN)\
    \ are wireless networks that allow de-\nvices to connect and communicate over\
    \ a local area without the need for\nphysical cables within a speciﬁc coverage\
    \ area, such as a home, ofﬁce, or public\nspace. These networks utilize the widely\
    \ recognized IEEE 802.11 standard,\ncommonly known as Wi-Fi, to enable devices\
    \ like smartphones, laptops, and\ntablets to enable wireless interconnection between\
    \ them and connection to\nthe internet. The Wi-Fi—802.11 wireless network, introduced\
    \ in 1997, using\nthe 2.4 GHz frequency band and supporting up to 2 Mbps data\
    \ transmission\nrates, evolved to the 802.11ac standard, operating in both 2.4\
    \ GHz and 5 GHz\nbands, achieving a maximum throughput of 1 Gbps for multiple\
    \ users, with\na minimum of 500 Mbps. WLANs offer greater coverage than WPANs,\
    \ span-\nning multiple rooms or entire buildings, making them suitable for larger-scale\n\
    wireless networking requirements. They provide convenient and ﬂexible con-\nnectivity\
    \ for various devices and applications, including internet access, ﬁle\nsharing,\
    \ video streaming, and more.\niii\nWireless Wide Area Networks (WWAN) provide\
    \ wireless connectivity on\na larger scale, spanning cities, regions, or even\
    \ entire countries. WWAN\ntechnologies, such as 4G Long-Term Evolution (LTE),\
    \ 5G, and the evolving\n6G, enable high-speed mobile internet access and support\
    \ a wide range of\nservices, including voice communication, video streaming, and\
    \ data transfer.\nThese networks rely on cellular infrastructure and are commonly\
    \ used for\nmobile devices like smartphones, tablets, and laptops to stay connected\
    \ while\non the go.\niv\nLow Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN) are wireless network\
    \ technologies\nideal for IoT devices with long battery life, extensive coverage,\
    \ and low cost.\nUnlike 3G/4G or Wi-Fi systems, LPWAN networks are not primarily\
    \ designed\nfor high data transmission speeds or reducing latency. Instead, LPWANs\
    \ target\nenergy efﬁciency, scalability, and coverage [42], thus gaining popularity\
    \ in\nindustrial and research communities. They provide long-range communication,\n\
    covering distances from 10 to 40 km in rural areas and 1 to 5 km in dense\nurban\
    \ areas. Their main advantages include energy efﬁciency, a battery life\nexceeding\
    \ ten years, and low cost, which is ideal for IoT applications that\nrequire small-scale\
    \ data transmission [48]. Various LPWAN technologies have\nbeen developed and\
    \ deployed in either licensed or unlicensed frequency bands,\nsuch as Long-Range\
    \ (LoRa), Narrow-Band IoT (NB-IoT), each employing\ndifferent techniques to achieve\
    \ the goals of LPWAN [49].\n•\nLoRa is an ideal wireless communication technology\
    \ for low-bandwidth\nIoT applications, offering long-range and low-power consumption\
    \ ser-\nvices. It uses a proprietary spread spectrum technique to achieve long-\n\
    range and low power consumption, operating in the unlicensed sub-GHz\nISM band\
    \ available worldwide [50].\n•\nNB-IoT is a widely used LPWAN technology connecting\
    \ various devices\nand services through cellular networks. It operates in a narrow\
    \ band-\nwidth of 180 kHz, providing extensive network coverage and low latency.\n\
    Designed for cost-effective and delay-tolerant IoT devices, NB-IoT utilizes\n\
    LTE techniques and can integrate with existing LTE infrastructure. Coex-\nisting\
    \ with LTE networks, NB-IoT offers power-efﬁcient connectivity and\nleverages\
    \ compatible technologies for seamless integration [51].\nThe main technical features\

    \ network should\nbe selected. Particularly in the context of establishing connectivity\
    \ among IoT devices\nlike sensors, the primary role is the selection of a network\
    \ with wide coverage and low\npower consumption. The LoRa network meets these\
    \ needs, is open, and is used in arti-\ncles [25,39–42,44]. In cases where the\
    \ application requires a higher data rate, Bluetooth\ntechnology can be used,\
    \ as mentioned in the article [44], but it has signiﬁcantly higher\npower consumption\
    \ compared to LoRa, and the coverage is 100 m for Bluetooth 4.x and\n200 m for\
    \ Bluetooth 5.x. For applications aimed at object identiﬁcation and detection,\
    \ such\nas products in warehouses and animals in agricultural operations, RFID\
    \ technology is a\nsuitable choice as mentioned in articles [43,45]. For applications\
    \ that require a high data rate\nand need to utilize a Wi-Fi network, the provision\
    \ of electrical power is necessary. Finally,\nonce DTs rely on data exchange,\
    \ real-time monitoring, and interaction with their physical\ncounterparts, wireless\
    \ networks provide a ﬂexible and efﬁcient means of communication\nfor these purposes\
    \ [8].\n3.1.4. Reliability, Integrity, and Credibility\nReliability, integrity,\
    \ and credibility are pivotal when DTs are entrusted with sensitive\ntasks involving\
    \ transaction management with their real counterparts. It becomes imper-\native\
    \ for the real twin to establish a sense of trust in their digital twin’s capabilities\
    \ and\nactions. Building and maintaining a solid connection between the real twin\
    \ and the DT is\ncrucial to foster effective collaboration, enabling reliable\
    \ decision-making, and ensuring\nsecure interactions. Consequently, a strong foundation\
    \ of trust becomes indispensable\nfor the successful operation and advancement\
    \ of DT-enabled systems [52]. Therefore,\nprivacy and security arise as paramount\
    \ considerations in the realm of DTs. To enable the\nconﬁdentiality and privacy\
    \ of their real twins, DTs should implement robust measures for\nidentity protection.\
    \ This can be achieved using dedicated cryptography algorithms and\nadvanced biometric\
    \ techniques such as ECG and haptic biometrics. By leveraging these\ntechniques,\
    \ the identity and privacy of the real twin can be established and safeguarded.\n\
    In addition to identity protection, DTs must prioritize data integrity, security,\
    \ and privacy.\nMeasures should be in place to prevent unauthorized access and\
    \ interception of data across\nthe network. Unauthorized users should be promptly\
    \ detected and repelled to prevent any\ncompromise of data integrity or security.\
    \ To ensure the authenticity and reliability of data\nsources, rigorous measures\
    \ for data authentication should be implemented before integrat-\ning the data\
    \ into the digital twin. Overall, DTs must incorporate comprehensive privacy\n\
    and security mechanisms to safeguard their real twins’ data’s identity, conﬁdentiality,\
    \ and\nintegrity. By adopting robust cryptographic algorithms, employing biometric\
    \ techniques,\nand implementing strict data authentication protocols, DTs can\
    \ effectively address privacy\nand security concerns, fostering a trustworthy\
    \ and secure environment for the real twins\nand their digital counterparts.\n\
    3.1.5. Distributed Ledger Technologies and Blockchain\nIn recent times, Distributed\
    \ Ledger Technologies (DLT), such as blockchain [44,53],\nhave emerged to add\
    \ to user authentication and data integrity regarding data sharing. To\nunlock\
    \ its full potential and achieve its envisioned advantages, addressing outstanding\n\
    concerns surrounding the technology is imperative. DLT offers a decentralized\
    \ approach\nthat eliminates the need for a central authority or database, distinguishing\
    \ it from traditional\ndata-sharing methods. The distributed nature of this system\
    \ allows for the secure sharing\nof data in a trustless environment. The signiﬁcance\
    \ of DLT has garnered considerable\ninterest from researchers and practitioners\
    \ alike. Various systems and platforms based\non Distributed Ledger Technology\
    \ (DLT), such as private ledgers, public ledgers, and\npermissioned ledgers, have\
    \ been created to address diverse use cases and speciﬁc needs [54].\nProposed\
    \ technological solutions stemming from IoT, AI, DT, and DLT have been put\nforward\
    \ to address the monitoring and tracking of products within the realm of food\n\
    supply logistics and chain and the analysis of collected data to facilitate decision-making\n\
    Sensors 2023, 23, 7128\n15 of 38\nprocesses [55]. Given the numerous advantages\
    \ associated with DLT, it presents itself as a\npromising technology that can\
    \ signiﬁcantly contribute to achieving the vision of CDT.\nBlockchain technologies,\
    \ in particular, seem to be an ideal structure for authenticating\nusers, storing\
    \ data records, and maintaining data integrity [8,56], providing a secure and\n\
    decentralized system of interconnected blocks formed through cryptographic functions.\n\
    It allows transactions to be recorded in a veriﬁable manner without intermediaries.\
    \ Each\npreceding block’s hash is included in the next block and is generated\
    \ through a distributed\nconsensus algorithm. With encryption mechanisms, blockchain\
    \ ensures data integrity\nand prevents tampering [43]. Ethereum, as a blockchain\
    \ scheme, provides an alternative\nprotocol for decentralized applications that,\
    \ unlike another blockchain scheme Bitcoin, is\nnot just a payment network but\
    \ also allows for the creation and use of smart contracts.\nIt uses its digital\
    \ currency called “ether” and incorporates a complete programming lan-\nguage\
    \ (such as Solidity) for smart contract development. Pieces of code stored on\
    \ the\nblockchain that enables decentralized transactions without a trusted central\
    \ authority are\ncalled Smart contracts [57].\nOn the other hand, the Helium Blockchain\
    \ is referred to as the major public decen-\ntralized LoRaWAN network in the world,\
    \ that enables devices anywhere in the world\nto wirelessly connect to the internet\
    \ and have a speciﬁc geographical placement without\nthe need for energy-consuming\
    \ satellite equipment or expensive mobile data plans [58].\nHelium offers low\
    \ transaction fees and connectivity for LoRa nodes and ensures end-to-end\nencryption,\
    \ which is useful whenever sensitive information is at stake.\nThe use of blockchain,\
    \ such as Ethereum and Helium, in IoT and digital twins for\nsmart agriculture\
    \ applications has the following advantages:\n•\nTransparency and trust: Blockchain\
    \ provides an open, transparent, and tamper-proof\ndistributed ledger, allowing\
    \ all stakeholders to verify the accuracy of the data. This can\nhelp build trust\
    \ among different entities in the agricultural supply chain and prevent\nfraud\
    \ or unauthorized interventions.\n•\nBlockchain enhances Data security [59] as\
    \ it utilizes cryptography to protect data. This\nis crucial for safeguarding\
    \ sensitive information related to smart agriculture, such as\ndata on plant health,\
    \ soil quality, and food production.\n•\nAutomation and smart contracts on the\
    \ blockchain enable programmable automatic\nexecution of conditions and actions\
    \ based on speciﬁc information, events, and opera-\ntions such as automated irrigation,\
    \ temperature control, and plant health monitoring\nin smart agriculture.\n•\n\
    The distributed architecture of blockchain ensures that information is stored\
    \ and\nveriﬁed by multiple nodes in the network, thus ensuring integrity and continuity\
    \ of\ndata and reducing dependency on a central authority.\n3.1.6. Cloud Computing\n\
    Cloud computing presents a valuable opportunity for DTs to enhance their scalability\n\
    and availability, assisting their real twins anytime and anywhere. By leveraging\
    \ cloud\ncomputing infrastructures, computation and control tasks can be ofﬂoaded\
    \ from the local\nenvironment to remote servers, enabling DTs to handle complex\
    \ processes and ensure\nseamless availability efﬁciently. The scalability of DTs\
    \ is signiﬁcantly improved through\ncloud computing, as the computational resources\
    \ can be dynamically allocated and scaled\nbased on demand. This allows DTs to\
    \ handle larger datasets, called Big Data sets (BD), per-\nform sophisticated\
    \ analytics, and execute resource-intensive tasks without local hardware\nlimitations.\
    \ As the DT model involves the creation and management of virtual replicas that\n\
    closely mimic real-world objects or systems, it requires extensive data acquisition,\
    \ storage,\nand processing capabilities for collecting and analyzing a massive\
    \ volume of data from\nvarious sources, including sensors, IoT devices, and other\
    \ data-generating components [7],\nfacts that necessitate cloud computing. The\
    \ elastic nature of cloud computing ensures\nthat DTs can adapt to varying workloads\
    \ and seamlessly accommodate ﬂuctuations in\ncomputational requirements.\nSensors\
    \ 2023, 23, 7128\n16 of 38\nFurthermore, cloud-based DTs offer the advantage of\
    \ ubiquitous accessibility by using\nopen-source communication platforms, such\
    \ as OPC Uniﬁed Architecture (UA) commu-\nnication protocol and frameworks, for\
    \ data exchange from sensors to cloud applications\nused in DTs. Real twins can\
    \ access and interact with their DTs from any location and at any\ntime, provided\
    \ an active internet connection is in place. This fosters a ﬂexible and versatile\n\
    environment where real twins can leverage the capabilities of their DTs regardless\
    \ of their\nphysical location.\n3.1.7. Internet of Things\nInternet of Things\
    \ (IoT) with 5G and the Tactile Internet (TI) entity meanings have\nemerged as\
    \ groundbreaking technologies, ushering in a new era of communication with\ntheir\
    \ focus on ultra-high reliability and ultra-low latency. This shift in communication\n\
    paradigms from content-oriented to control-oriented is especially signiﬁcant for\
    \ applica-\ntions that involve human-in-the-loop interactions, demanding minimal\
    \ delays and seamless\nintegration of communication and control mechanisms as\
    \ demanded in DT infrastructure.\nWithin this context, DTs play a pivotal role\
    \ by establishing a continuously operational twin\nfeedback loop, ultimately enhancing\
    \ the service quality of physical systems [60,61]. This\nseamless real-time feedback\
    \ communication loop empowers DTs to constantly monitor,\nanalyze, and adapt to\
    \ the evolving conditions of the physical systems they represent. As a\nresult,\
    \ precise control actions and optimizations can be executed, ultimately enhancing\
    \ the\nphysical systems’ overall service quality and performance.\nThrough the\
    \ IoT, users can seamlessly provide contextual data to their DT while\nreceiving\
    \ feedback that can be used to enhance their interaction with the environment,\n\
    both locally and remotely. Various communication technologies within IoT are required\
    \ to\ntransmit data and status information from sensors in the physical entity\
    \ to the data entity,\nenabling seamless connectivity and communication between\
    \ connected devices [17], as\nshown in Figure 7.\nSensors 2023, 23, 7128 \n17\

    \ such data from users to their DTs and vice versa. This exchange \nof information\
    \ enables users to interact seamlessly with their surroundings, whether in \n\
    close proximity or at remote locations. Additionally, digital twins can provide\
    \ valuable \nfeedback to the environment, further enriching the user experience\
    \ and enabling a more \nintegrated and interconnected ecosystem.  \n3.1.8. Modelling\

    \ and Simulation Software\nA DT could be addressed as a tight combination of (i)\
    \ an object model, in conjunction\nwith (ii) an expansive set of data that is\
    \ directly following the object that may evolve,\nand ﬁnally, (iii) a method for\
    \ modifying and reﬁning the model based on the available\ndata [17,62]. The experts\
    \ decide the need and selection of the training, validation and\nveriﬁcation data\
    \ concerning speciﬁc case studies, types of soil, plant types, leaf area, plant\n\
    height, regarding the Physical Twin, or technological use cases. Critical data\
    \ processing\ndepends on speciﬁc plant characteristics, experimental setups, dedicated\
    \ sensors, ML and\nDL applicable methods and big data analytics software.\nOne\
    \ of the signiﬁcant beneﬁts of utilizing the DT approach is its ability to accurately\n\
    depict objects or entities that change over time, owing to the incorporation of\
    \ dynamic\nand evolving data. Employing a digital twin makes it possible to extend\
    \ the application\nof a validated model across timescales during which the object\
    \ and its behavior undergo\nsigniﬁcant variations. A validated model may offer\
    \ an instant representation of an object’s\nbehavior at a speciﬁc moment, thus\
    \ highlighting the importance of associating the DT with\na corresponding physical\
    \ counterpart and the signiﬁcance of choosing a model according\nto the speciﬁc\
    \ implementation.\nWithout a physical twin, the DT would be considered nothing\
    \ more than a model.\nFurthermore, the availability of a comprehensive and up-to-date\
    \ dataset plays a crucial\nrole in accurately capturing the object’s changes over\
    \ time and ensuring the model is\nadjusted and updated to reﬂect the current system\
    \ conditions. Any model approximating\nthe physical twinned can be used for DTs\
    \ that utilize physics-based models encompassing\nall relevant processes that\
    \ can inﬂuence the measured quantities. In an ideal scenario with\ninstantaneous\
    \ computing and ﬂawless accuracy, these models would accurately simulate\nand\
    \ update the mechanical and thermal processes involved in real-time operations.\
    \ For\ninstance, a DT of a machine tool could simulate the milling of metal, considering\
    \ factors\nlike temperature and part shape, and dynamically update information\
    \ about tool wear\nbased on real-time measurements. This enables proactive and\
    \ effective industrial plant\nfacilities maintenance, enhancing overall efﬁciency\
    \ [62,63]. Similarly, to an industrial plant\nin agriculture, a digital model\
    \ could represent the growth of a plant regarding its physical\nenvironmental\
    \ conditions that are changing over time.\nAccording to researchers, a categorization\
    \ standard centered around the degree of\ndata fusion and integration between\
    \ the PO and its virtual representation can be used as\nan indicator to deﬁne\
    \ and delimit the scope of the proposed concept. Given that this term\nwas initially\
    \ created for the manufacturing industry, it serves as a proxy for evaluating\n\
    agricultural DTs’ development, convergences, and divergences compared to contemporary\n\
    deﬁnitions. Thus, three integration levels represent the digital twin’s ﬁeld.\
    \ First is the\nDigital Model (DM), second is the Digital Shadow (DS), and third\
    \ is the DT. The DM is a\ndepiction of the entity in a digital format without\
    \ the use of an automated data transfer\nsystem. It is equivalent to a Digital\
    \ Twin prototype and represents the lowest possible\nintegration level. The DS\
    \ refers to a digital representation that enables the automatic\nexchange of information\
    \ from the physical entity to its virtual object, reﬂecting changes\nin the entity’s\
    \ state. This one-way information ﬂow is like a DT model, which in contrast,\n\
    involves an automated bi-directional ﬂow of digital information. Like the DS,\
    \ the DT has a\nvirtual representation whose alterations are reﬂected in the physical\
    \ entity’s state. However,\nwhat sets the DT apart is its capacity to impact the\
    \ condition of the physical entity as well,\nalthough the speciﬁc means of inﬂuence\
    \ depend on the type of entity and its context [63].\nIn summary, a DM represents\
    \ a physical system in a digital format but lacks auto-\nmated data exchange.\
    \ A DS involves a one-way automated data ﬂow reaching the digital\ncounterpart\
    \ originating from the physical system. Conversely, a DT involves seamless and\n\
    fully integrated automated communication between the digital counterpart of the\
    \ physical\nsystem and the physical system itself.\nDeﬁning the objectives of\
    \ the modelling process is the initial stage in creating a model\nfor an integrated\
    \ process. Recognizing that a model is merely a reality approximation is\nSensors\
    \ 2023, 23, 7128\n18 of 38\nessential, as diverse objectives can provide different\
    \ levels of complexity in representing\nthe actual procedure. For this reason,\
    \ it is crucial to identify the goal of the model before the\nbuild [64]. Therefore,\
    \ complex systems like an agriculture model should be ﬁrst designed\nand objectively\
    \ deﬁned so their DT model is accurate. Spreadsheet software such as\nMicrosoft\
    \ Excel is commonly employed for process calculations and analyses. This is\n\
    due to its widespread availability and familiarity among scientists, engineers,\
    \ and other\nprofessionals. In contrast, the concept of DTs is somehow new and\
    \ still emerging. The\nspreadsheet’s cells allow users to enter data, make computations,\
    \ and produce results\nwhile they can plot data from them in several graphs. Software\
    \ programs like process\nsimulators allow users to describe and analyze integrated\
    \ processes. The purpose of\nthese tools is to simulate continuous processes and\
    \ their transient behavior. The scientiﬁc\nliterature concerning process simulation\
    \ tools is continuously growing, encompassing\nvarious areas such as techno-economic\
    \ analyses, economic feasibility studies, structural\nprocess enhancements, and\
    \ the exploration of alternative processes to existing ones [64].\nGiven that\
    \ a DT model is much more than a simulation tool, by nature, never being an\n\
    exact representation of reality. Still, really an approximation of it, and different\
    \ objectives\nmay produce various modelling abstractions with varying levels of\
    \ detail concerning the\nactual process. It is crucial to identify the goal of\
    \ the model before we develop it.\nSince cloud computing has many beneﬁts, it\
    \ is the most practical method for introduc-\ning DT services. Due to its ability\
    \ to provide on-demand services, computational resources,\nand ubiquitous network\
    \ access, the implementation of the next-generation information\ntechnology architecture\
    \ is highly compatible with DT environments. In such environments,\ndata owners\
    \ generate data from assets, transmit it to cloud servers, simulate the DT in\
    \ a\nvirtual environment, and subsequently share the insights and ﬁndings of the\
    \ simulation\nwith the data owner. Users can request access to the data at any\
    \ time [59]. In construct-\ning complex DT production systems, like industrial\
    \ or agricultural systems, “machine\nlearning” and “simulation tools” are two\
    \ complementary technologies. Creating stochastic\nsimulations for complicated\
    \ systems takes time and effort. However, these simulations\nare essential for\
    \ DT construction because they have two crucial capabilities. The ﬁrst is\n“uncertainty\
    \ modelling” and the second is “explainable analytics”. Focusing on how ML\nand\
    \ reinforcement learning (RL) improve simulation, many issues arise in digital\
    \ twin use\ncases. The rapid advancement of IoT, edge computing, and cloud computing\
    \ technologies\nhas signiﬁcantly accelerated the progress of digital twins. It\
    \ is widely believed that digital\ntwins will soon become a vital catalyst for\
    \ digital transformation, as evidenced by the com-\nmon theme present in various\
    \ research studies [65]. The primary hurdle lies in establishing\na secure, reliable\
    \ method to share simulation and real-time data. Additionally, there is a\nneed\
    \ for a robust and privacy-centric authentication system that leverages the beneﬁts\
    \ of\nblockchain technology to address the security prerequisites mentioned earlier.\n\
    3.2. Notable Components of DT Implementations\nIn the realm of digital twins,\
    \ components denote the distinct constituents or elements\nthat constitute a digital\
    \ twin system. A representative ensemble follows.\n3.2.1. Sensors and Actuators\n\
    DTs embody sensors and actuators as parts of great signiﬁcance that offer valuable\n\
    data and information about physical phenomena and enable the replication of sensory\n\
    capabilities. In today’s interconnected world, an enormous number of sensors and\
    \ actuators\nare deployed across various domains, ranging from consumer products\
    \ to industrial set-\ntings such as smart factories and smartwatches. These sensors\
    \ capture critical information\nrelated to temperature, humidity, velocity, pressure,\
    \ chemical components, and material\ncomposition, forming the foundation for digital\
    \ twin technology [47,66]. By equipping real\ntwins (physical entities) with sensors,\
    \ DTs can replicate and harness the senses of sight,\ntemperature, sound, humidity,\
    \ and touch through appropriate actuators. For example,\nin the agricultural domain,\
    \ a DT of a plant could leverage sensors to create predictive\nSensors 2023, 23,\
    \ 7128\n19 of 38\nmaintenance services or simulate and optimize the production\
    \ process. This allows for the\ngeneration of actionable insights and the enhancement\
    \ of operational efﬁciency. DTs rely on\nthe integration of actuator and sensor\
    \ technologies to gather continuous and accurate data.\nThe representation of\
    \ a physical asset in digital forms, like a sensor-equipped machine,\nrelies on\
    \ the synchronized operation of virtual sensors and actuators. These software-based\n\
    counterparts replicate the functionalities of physical sensors and actuators,\
    \ aggregating\ndata from multiple sources. Integrating sensors and actuators within\
    \ the digital twin\nframework enables real-time monitoring, data-driven analytics,\
    \ and the ability to simulate\nvarious scenarios for optimization purposes. By\
    \ bridging the physical and digital realms,\ndigital twins empower industries\
    \ and sectors to achieve enhanced performance, increased\nefﬁciency, and cost\
    \ savings.\n3.2.2. Identiﬁcation of Entities\nIn the context of DTs, each twin\
    \ is assigned a distinct identiﬁer that facilitates seamless\ncommunication with\
    \ its physical counterpart. This unique identiﬁer encapsulates vital\ninformation\
    \ about the physical object’s structure, capabilities, and technical speciﬁcations,\n\
    as well as its expected performance under speciﬁc conditions. When creating a\
    \ DT, it is\ncrucial to consider the unique circumstances of the object to ensure\
    \ an accurate represen-\ntation [67]. Even if two physical items are identical,\
    \ they may exhibit different behaviors\nwhen subjected to varying conditions.\
    \ Hence, each digital twin is assigned its unique iden-\ntiﬁer, reﬂecting the\
    \ individual characteristics and attributes of the corresponding physical\nobject.\
    \ By leveraging the DT’s unique identiﬁer, we can accurately simulate and analyze\
    \ its\nproperties and behaviours.\nFurthermore, the expansive network of interconnected\
    \ devices, sensors, and actuators\nhighlights the need for real-time collection\
    \ and sharing of identiﬁed contextual data with\ndigital twins. This data encompasses\
    \ various parameters such as location, environmen-\ntal conditions, user preferences,\
    \ and behavioral patterns. By integrating this uniquely\nidentiﬁed contextual\
    \ data into the DT model, a deep understanding of the user’s context\nand needs\
    \ can be achieved. Adding to that notion, a Geographic Information System\n(GIS)\
    \ as a versatile system generates, controls, examines, and maps various data types\
    \ and\nlinks IoT data to a map. Thus, GIS combines location information, referred\
    \ to as spatial\ndata, with descriptive details of a DT, forming the basis for\
    \ mapping and analysis utilized\nacross multiple industries and scientiﬁc ﬁelds.\
    \ With GIS, users gain insights into patterns,\nrelationships, and the geographical\
    \ context of their data, as in [68].\n3.2.3. Visualization and Representation\n\
    Visualization and representation play a vital role in DTs, offering various forms\n\
    of virtual representation depending on the speciﬁc application. DTs can leverage\
    \ 3D\nvisualizations to facilitate collaborative design or planning [69]. Depending\
    \ on the context,\nthese connections can manifest in various forms, such as a\
    \ 3D representation, hologram,\nhumanoid social robot, or purely as software components\
    \ without physical attendance.\nConsequently, DT commonly refers to the digital\
    \ depiction of a real-world object, system, or\nentity’s physical twin that faithfully\
    \ replicates a unique item, process, person, organization,\nor even a legendary\
    \ narrative. Composite digital twins are formed when multiple digital\ntwins merge.\
    \ These DTs, as reﬂections of the actual world, share similar characteristics,\n\
    necessitating the modelling of digital processes and objects with composition,\
    \ ﬂexibility,\nsensing, collaboration, and simulation capabilities. Furthermore,\
    \ predictions suggest that\nfuture DTs will evolve toward a holistic virtual world\
    \ [70].\n3.2.4. Devices\nDevices that continuously capture data concerning physiological\
    \ and environmental\nfactors information can serve DTs to gain a comprehensive\
    \ understanding of the real\ntwin’s well-being and lifestyle. Such wearable devices,\
    \ for example, smartwatches, ﬁtness\ntrackers, and other health monitoring devices\
    \ have enabled individuals to collect and\nSensors 2023, 23, 7128\n20 of 38\n\
    track various physiological parameters effortlessly. The abundance of such data\
    \ presents\na unique opportunity for digital twins to enhance their support for\
    \ their real twins more\nefﬁciently [71]. By integrating the data from wearables\
    \ into the DT model, real-time\ninsights and personalized recommendations can\
    \ be generated as feedback or alerts based on\nspeciﬁc needs and goals. Furthermore,\
    \ the continuous monitoring and analysis of wearable\ndata by DTs enable proactive\
    \ interventions whilst identifying patterns or deviations from\nnormal physiological\
    \ parameters and providing early warnings or interventions to address\npotential\
    \ health risks or optimize performance. This proactive support can contribute\
    \ to\npreventive healthcare, early detection of health issues, and overall well-being\
    \ management.\nIn summary, the DT is an advanced data management system that integrates\
    \ 3D ani-\nmation, modelling, IoT, AI, and other technologies such as ML. It enables\
    \ the seamless con-\nnection and management of physical and virtual models within\
    \ a digital environment [72].\nAs human civilization grows, agriculture remains\
    \ crucial for our progress and well-being.\nIntelligent DT systems can analyze\
    \ and digitize agricultural areas, enabling macro and\nmicro-level visual processes.\
    \ These systems can provide intelligent recommendations and\nsuggestions that\
    \ can be implemented to achieve multiple beneﬁts in agriculture.\n4. Reviewing\

    \ address the signiﬁcance of a DT case study in\nagriculture. The concept of DTs\
    \ is mainly addressed in all reviewed papers. In 16 papers\nthough [19,26–28,64,73,82],\
    \ the DT concept is analyzed and utilized in more detail, thus\nposing the signiﬁcance\
    \ of using DTs in smart farming and agriculture.\nAccording to the reviewed literature\
    \ summarized in Table 2, smart farming as an\nimplementation of agriculture 4.0\
    \ [19,26–29,45,63,73,75–77,79–88] includes smart irrigation\nstrategies by monitoring\
    \ and controlling various farming stages [28], implementing data\nacquisition\
    \ techniques [27] for automatically controlling actuator systems in agriculture\
    \ or\neven in high-tech data-driven greenhouses [79]. Furthermore, via simulation,\
    \ monitoring,\ncontrolling, coordinating, and executing farm operations at agricultural\
    \ sites [87], DTs\nimprove predictive control in precision irrigation [28,73,88],\
    \ greenhouse horticulture, and\norganic vegetable and livestock farming. Smart\
    \ farming enhances remote detection and\nmonitoring of vegetation and crop stress\
    \ in agriculture [86], developing DT stages and\nforecasting plant yield in greenhouses,\
    \ vertical farms, or outdoor ﬁelds [76,77], or even in\nurban and indoor farming,\
    \ of vertical agriculture utilizing hydroponics, aeroponics, aqua-\nculture, and\
    \ aquaponics. Smart farming approaches the smart agriculture [85] as well as the\n\
    sustainable agriculture 4.0 [80] sector to address precision farming and management\
    \ [75,76]\nvia the adoption of digital technologies and techniques in agriculture\
    \ [27,29,64], leading the\nway to digital representations of plants [9], inventory\
    \ quality in agriculture, greenhouse\nproduction ﬂow, and food safety and quality\
    \ within the food supply chain [45]. Although\nthe DTs remain a major issue in\
    \ our research criteria, in papers [29,45,63,83–85], they are\nimplied as such.\
    \ In [9], authors propose a functional DT model; in [86], they are proposed\n\
    as a signiﬁcant future issue to address and study.\n4.2. The Second Categorization\

    \ and monitoring of vegetation and crop stress in agriculture seem\nfeasible based\
    \ on [86] utilizing LiDAR—stereo-photogrammetry technology, using multi-\nspectral\
    \ imagery, passive microwave remote sensing, RFID schemes [9,45], active mi-\n\
    crowave remote sensing (RADAR) and sensors onboard UAVs and satellites [45,76,88].\n\
    Location determination in farming via geospatial position (GPS) plays a signiﬁcant\
    \ role in\nthe remote detection and monitoring of vegetation and crop conditions\
    \ in agriculture [88].\nIoT deployments in smart farming are based on serial hardware\
    \ communication pro-\ntocols such as I2C serial bus [28] and UART that uses asynchronous\
    \ serial communication\nwith conﬁgurable speed and pulse width modulation (PWM)\
    \ for driving actuators [77,81],\nin correlation with programmable logic controllers\
    \ (PLC) for data recording [29], monitor-\ning, and optimization aided occasionally\
    \ by fuzzy interference systems (FIS) [73].\nThe decision-making and actions once\
    \ undertaken by the farmers now have given\nway to data-driven agricultural decision-making,\
    \ i.e., assisting them to undertake informed\ndecisions related to planting, fertilization,\
    \ pest control, harvesting, and overall farm man-\nagement. Likewise, derived\
    \ from the smart water management project (SWAMP) [28,73,75]\na hands-on approach\
    \ is being utilized to develop a precision irrigation platform based on\nIoT technology\
    \ for smart water management, distributed in Brazil, Italy, and Spain.\n4.3. The\
    \ Third Categorization of Research Literature That Is Related to Speciﬁc Technical\n\
    Research Aspects\nDTs use software to create, operate, and interact with their\
    \ physical counterparts. The\nsoftware component of a DT enables the collection,\
    \ processing, and analysis of data from\nvarious sources, including sensors, actuators,\
    \ and other connected devices.\nIn [28,77], the high-level programming language\
    \ Python is used for software develop-\nment, scripting, and data analysis, serving\
    \ the purposes of DT applications, implementing\nthe Arduino IDE platform, and\
    \ exploiting the Debian Buster OS to produce a plant simula-\ntion model. Likewise,\
    \ RPi software for the Raspberry Pi platform is used with goal-oriented\nrequirement\
    \ language (GRL) for modelling [80]. We should point out the use of an open\n\
    standard ﬁle format JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) which is used in [73] for\
    \ data repre-\nsentation and communication between systems and is widely adopted\
    \ and supported by\nvarious programming languages and platforms. Speciﬁc software\
    \ packages are utilized\nfor constructing 3D plant models, such as Unreal Engine\
    \ 5, Reality Capture, Photoshop,\nMesh Model Construction, Autodesk, Maya [74],\
    \ Unreal Engine 5 Nanite technology, and\nReality [35]. Other speciﬁc software\
    \ packages serving, for example, the construction of\na DT ﬂowsheet model as in\
    \ [64] found in the researched literature are the Aspen Plus\nand Aspen HYSYS\
    \ from Aspen Technology, Inc. (Burlington, MA, USA), ChemCAD from\nChemstations,\
    \ Inc. (Houston, TX, USA), UniSim Design from Honeywell (Charlotte, NC,\nUSA),\
    \ ProSimPlus from ProSim SA (Labege, France) and PRO/II from AVEVA Group plc.\n\
    Simulation software was employed in this study [28] to generate a virtual setting\
    \ for\nan irrigation system’s digital twin, incorporating a plant simulation model.\n\
    As previously mentioned, in [73], Siemens’s industrial plant simulation software\n\
    was used, and in [74], the Virtual UCF Arboretum Application (V1.0) was developed\n\
    with virtual plant datasets, plant inventories, VR headsets leading to an AR Holodeck\
    \ by\nmultiple captured images taken in 3D space and an AR perpetual garden App.\n\
    In [75], a linear model of plant growth is proposed utilizing a wheat multi-agent\n\
    planning module close enough to the implied structure modelling simulation in\
    \ [29],\nvirtual models are used during the usage phase in [84], an earth system\
    \ model in [78], a\nfarm is represented in 3D in [81], the concept of the DT model\
    \ via data-driven modelling is\nassessed [63]. In [76], the authors imply that\
    \ a software package was developed containing\nSensors 2023, 23, 7128\n29 of 38\n\
    an ontology editor, a DT editor, multi-agent planning module for creating a prototype\
    \ of\nan intelligent plant DT system in Java whilst AR implementations to save\
    \ BIM model ﬁles\nin Film box (.FBX) in [79] by using Unity game engine to provide\
    \ 3D modelling software.\nFurther authors in [9] confronted post-harvest models\
    \ by discrete event simulation such as\ndrying, adding to the simulation models\
    \ for blending and ﬂow DT models [82,83] that rely\nheavily on available real-time\
    \ data a ﬂow for continuous adaption and learning. Finally, DT\nmodelling implies\
    \ simulation, analysis, and prediction [88] that may assess the modelling\nand\
    \ simulation of the fertility of seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, pollution challenges,\
    \ soil\nagents (hydrological models, soil data), and crop agents\nTable 4 summarises\

    Structure\nmodelling\nsimulation\nOn the other hand, AI, ML, and DL algorithms\
    \ seem to be a major issue in [45,63,83,87,88],\nleading to Big Data analytics\
    \ [82] to describe DT modelling that relies heavily on real-time\nSensors 2023,\
    \ 23, 7128\n31 of 38\navailable data ﬂow. The immense amount of data is stored\
    \ in databases such as Mongo\nDB [28,73], Draco, My-SQL [28,73], and SQLite [80,81],\
    \ besides using Excel CSV ﬁles for\nretrieving height values [79] or generally\
    \ mentioned Knowledge bases as in [75] leading to\ncloud big data manipulation\
    \ schemes in [45,81,85]. Major cloud computing platforms such\nas Alibaba Cloud,\
    \ Amazon web services, Google Cloud Platform, IBM, and Microsoft Azure\nare examples\
    \ of cloud computing services provided by leading technology companies that\n\
    serve the DT idea, as seen in [87].\nCloud IoT service broker agents come into\
    \ place as a software component or intermedi-\nary that facilitates the interaction\
    \ between cloud service consumers (users or organizations)\nand cloud service\
    \ providers like FIWARE. In [28,73], FIWARE cloud applications are ex-\nploited,\
    \ adding to IoT broker and IoT agents to facilitate cloud management of context\n\
    information. The procedure includes converting various communication protocols\
    \ into a\nshared base protocol and incorporating intelligent functionality through\
    \ the processing,\nanalysing, and visualising of contextual data. FIWARE generally\
    \ is used as an open-\nsource platform to provide a standardized framework and\
    \ a set of reusable components for\nbuilding smart applications and services in\
    \ the context of the IoT and Future Internet (FI)\ndomains. It aims to simplify\
    \ the development of innovative and interoperable solutions\nby offering a collection\
    \ of open APIs, data models, and software tools that facilitate the\ndevelopment\
    \ of smart applications and services.\nA fuzzy inference system enhances adaptive\
    \ and learning capabilities. It handles\nnonlinear and complex relationships between\
    \ variables, as in [73], in addition to Siemens\nindustrial plant simulation software\
    \ for plant simulation model production with a weather\nstation. In [67,79], the\
    \ Microsoft Excel spreadsheet application is used instead of other\ndedicated\
    \ software such as Geo-Soft-Core, a Geoscientiﬁc Software & Code Repository\n\
    hosted at the archive DIGITAL.CSIC in [78] or Java ontology editor to elaborate\
    \ a DT\neditor in [75,76].\nLastly, wireless network communication technologies\
    \ are addressed in the research\nliterature. Initially, the wired networking technology\
    \ Ethernet is mentioned in [28,73,77],\nwhile the wireless networking technologies\
    \ such as Wi-Fi are mentioned in [35,45,74,77,87],\nLoRaWAN in [45,73], mobile\
    \ or cellular in [45,74,87] and generally mentioned as mandatory\nin [29,82].\
    \ Bluetooth, RFID, and NB-IoT are exploited in [85].\n5. Discussion\nA ﬁrst attempt\
    \ to comment on speciﬁc aspects of the reviewed literature has been done\nin Section\
    \ 2. In total, 14 journal articles or conference papers, including a published\
    \ book,\npropose case studies that support the idea of DT implementation in agriculture,\
    \ contrary to\nthe rest published review papers that sufﬁce to merely describe\
    \ the topic and record the\nachievements of the scientiﬁc community referring\
    \ to it.\nIt is interesting to point out that three (3) relevant case study conference\
    \ papers and a\npublished book, added to nine (9) journal articles, seem to slightly\
    \ overcome the amount\nof the 12 review papers in a total of 26 articles. The\
    \ limited practical application of digital\ntwin technologies is obvious, even\
    \ stated in the literature by the authors.\nEven though [9,86,87] are review papers,\
    \ the authors either describe the necessity of a\nDT model as in [9] for the agriculture\
    \ supply chain management domain, even addressing\nsensors such as level, ﬂow,\
    \ identiﬁcation sensors, RFID or DNA tags, or highlight the need\nfor future study\
    \ on DT models as in [86] making use of remote detection and monitoring\nschemes,\
    \ LiDAR sensors, passive microwave sensing devices, RADARs or even sensors\nonboard\
    \ UAVs and satellites, for monitoring, controlling, coordinating, and executing\
    \ farm\noperations at agricultural sites by IoT sensor nodes as in [87].\nThe\
    \ signiﬁcance of using Sensors as part of a dynamic IoT control-oriented mechanism\n\
    as demanded in DT infrastructure should be acknowledged as in [35,73,74,77,79–81,87,88]\n\
    where soil probes, drone image cameras, multispectral and photographic cameras,\
    \ IR\nthermometers, mini-LiDAR sensors, a mesh of sensors measuring temperature,\
    \ humidity,\nSensors 2023, 23, 7128\n32 of 38\nluminosity, and relative CO2 concentration,\
    \ and air velocity are addressed as essential\nelements to materialize relevant\
    \ IoT platforms accordingly.\nIn [28,73,75,88], the SWAMP IoT-based smart water\
    \ management platform is men-\ntioned. In [19,26], the IoT scheme is merely addressed,\
    \ and in the journal [82], IoT is only\nmentioned as well in the review papers\
    \ [63,85,87], where the IoT is stated as a promising\nconcept. The fact that in\
    \ [73] an OPC UA server is recommended for implementation,\nin [77] an Arduino\
    \ single-board computer is used as well as the Raspberry Pi-3 platform as\nin\
    \ [80,81] in a total of 14 articles that either describe the use of IoT platforms\
    \ or vaguely\npresent a case study project [9,19,26,28,35,64,74–77,79–82] means\
    \ that the practical imple-\nmentation of IoT platforms is quite limited for the\
    \ time being.\nThe necessary software to operate such platforms is focused on\
    \ Python [28,77], ded-\nicated FIS, Json, FIWARE Cygnus connector, IoT Agent,\
    \ OPC agent [73], RPi in [77,80],\nArduino IDE n [77] relevant to the case studies\
    \ previously mentioned. These make use\nof Ethernet communication technologies\
    \ [28,73,77], LoRa [73], and Wi-Fi, [77] in addition\nto [35,74] that make use\
    \ of Wi-Fi and mobile LTE [74] communication technologies that\nfacilitate near\
    \ real-time interaction with the environment.\nThe concept and deﬁnition of DT\
    \ seem to be continuously evolving, but in general,\nit refers to a speciﬁc collection\
    \ of digitally or virtually materialized models that represent\na physical process\
    \ or object. These models are used for simulation and future behavior\nforecasting,\
    \ guiding the feedback loop from the Actuators and Control node to the Physical\n\
    entity, as profoundly visualized in Figures 3–5. The ongoing feedback loop between\
    \ the\nphysical farm and the DT is imperative to update the DT model to optimize\
    \ and enhance\nperformance and efﬁciency.\nSeveral attempts have been made in\
    \ this direction. In the reviews [9,29,63,83,86], the\nconcept of the DT model\
    \ is proposed merely as an evolving concept without an imple-\nmented case study.\
    \ Simulation models [83], referring to data-driven modelling, discrete\nevent\
    \ simulation blending and ﬂow models [9], and structure modelling simulation and\n\
    future multi-domain radiative transfer models (e.g., SCOPE) with dynamic crop\
    \ growth\nmodels for agroecosystems DTs [86] are described merely as proposals\
    \ giving way to future\npractical implementations. On the other hand, in [28],\
    \ simulation software utilizing a\nsimple plant simulation model is employed to\
    \ create a virtual environment for an irrigation\nsystem’s digital twin. In [73],\
    \ the Siemens industrial plant simulation software for the\ndata model is used,\
    \ a model of the Earth system is mentioned in [78], a 3D representation\nof a\
    \ farm in [81], while in [82] it continuous adaption and learning procedure of\
    \ the DT\nmodelling is mentioned as a need that relies heavily on available data.\
    \ A more concise\nproposal to the origin of the holistic DT modelling and simulation\
    \ concept appears in [76],\nwhere a prototype of an intelligent plant DT system\
    \ in Java claimed to be developed, includ-\ning an ontology editor, a digital\
    \ twin editor, and a multi-agent planning module. In [88],\nsimulation, analysis,\
    \ and prediction are addressed by making progress in implementing\nmodelling and\
    \ simulation of the fertility of seeds, fertilizer, pesticides, and pollution\
    \ chal-\nlenges, making efforts to develop plant modelling with soil agents (hydrological\
    \ models,\nsoil data), crop agents and predictive control models, where the adjustment\
    \ of control\nprocesses such as heating and ventilation is automated based on\
    \ short-term temperature\npredictions, ensuring efﬁcient regulation, as an IoT\
    \ derivative scheme.\nA ﬂowsheet model is proposed taking advantage of the widespread\
    \ spreadsheet\napplications of Microsoft Excel in [64] to tamper with simulation\
    \ software such as Aspen\nPlus and Aspen HYSYS from Aspen Technology, Inc. (Burlington,\
    \ MA, USA), ChemCAD\nfrom Chemstations, Inc. (Houston, TX, USA), UniSim Design\
    \ from Honeywell (Charlotte,\nNC, USA), ProSimPlus from ProSim SA (Labege, France)\
    \ and PRO/II from AVEVA Group\nplc, merely to implement a digital modelling approach\
    \ to food processing.\nSpreadsheet applications of Microsoft Excel to retrieve\
    \ height values of plants in high-\ntech data-driven greenhouses are used in [79],\
    \ a fact that proves that process calculations\nand analyses may be conducted\
    \ using popular spreadsheet software like Microsoft Excel\nSensors 2023, 23, 7128\n\
    33 of 38\ndue to its wide accessibility and familiarity among scientists, engineers,\
    \ and professionals\nfrom various ﬁelds.\nEnhanced 3D modelling software derived\
    \ from the game industry, i.e., Unity game en-\ngine dictates BIM models in Film\
    \ box (.FBX) format to aid realistic VR/AR representations\nof greenhouses, providing\
    \ a promising realistic overview of a Smart Agriculture imple-\nmentation. Virtual\
    \ representation is accomplished via Unreal Engine 5, Reality Capture,\nPhotoshop,\
    \ Autodesk, and Maya software platforms to construct Mesh models of Plant\nDatasets\
    \ for Virtual UCF Arboretum Applications, plant inventories, and AR Perpetual\n\
    Garden App. as in [74]. These plant datasets are derived from multiple captured\
    \ images\nin 3D space and incorporate VR headsets aided by GIS and AR Holodeck\
    \ software. Ad-\nditionally, Unreal Engine 5 Nanite technology and Reality are\
    \ used for 3D plant models\noffering a linear plant growth model [35] to descriptively\
    \ sufﬁce the wheat multi-agent\nplanning module. Using multiple captured images\
    \ taken in 3D space to support the AR\nPerpetual Garden App, they produce botanically\
    \ correct plant models for use in museums\nand for educational purposes. A promising\
    \ perspective, if by any chance associated with\nthe essential elements of the\
    \ holistic DT scheme, could be capturing real-time data on\nvarious environmental\
    \ and operational factors via communication technologies leading to\na dynamic\
    \ 3D model of a farm entity.\nBesides the 3D representation of DT models, IoT\
    \ Dashboards [87], such as Grafana in\nparticular [28,73] for real-time data presentation\
    \ and analysis or even GUI prototypes [81],\nare proposed, although used on a\
    \ small scale for facilitating near real-time interaction of\nDTs with the environment.\
    \ To reliably transfer and manage data, Blockchain is used, even\non a smaller\
    \ scale, as in [45,87], while Big Data Analytics, as in [82], AI and ML methods\n\
    that enable data analysis, pattern recognition, and decision-making based on large\
    \ datasets,\nare addressed in [45,63,82,83,86,88]. Cloud-based data analytics\
    \ pose a major issue for\nthe advent of smart agriculture as claimed in [45,85,87],\
    \ not to omit the signiﬁcance of\ndatabases such Mongo DB, Draco, My-SQL as used\
    \ in [28,73] or SQLite in [80], and Cloud\ncomputing service providers such as\
    \ Alibaba Cloud, Amazon web services, Microsoft\nAzure and Google Cloud platform\
    \ [87].\nVarious factors, with technical hurdles being the primary challenge,\
    \ seem to be step-\nping behind to allow even further the adoption of the DT technologies.\
    \ It is essential\nto meticulously design and clearly deﬁne intricate agricultural\
    \ systems to guarantee the\naccuracy of their corresponding DT models.\n6. Future\
    \ Directions\nOnce addressing a DT as a tight combination of an object model,\
    \ in conjunction with\nexpansive sets of data that directly follow the object\
    \ that may evolve and continually modify\nand adapt the model based on the available\
    \ data, it is made clear that future research should\nbe realized to overcome\
    \ the current profound lack of reference models and case studies\naccordingly.\
    \ That could serve as a direct guidance for DT research and development.\nTo broaden\
    \ the aspect of Agriculture 4.0 that needs DTs and overcome the limitations\n\
    of mere telemetry narrowed down by IoT schemes implemented till now, further research\n\
    in implementations using DT modelling, 3D visualization, and simulation schemes\
    \ tar-\ngeting virtual nature applications aided by AR, VR, and GIS information\
    \ systems should\nbe realized.\nFurther research into the holistic model perception\
    \ of plant DTs to overcome the focus\nmerely on the phenotype of plants could\
    \ vastly support DT research. We can pursue\nenhancing the accuracy of depicting\
    \ real-world farms, plants, and crops in the digital realm\nby combining non-georeferenced\
    \ visualizations, like gaming engines, with geospatially\nreferenced 3D geo visualizations.\n\
    Implementing additional case studies of digital twins that adhere to the mentioned\n\
    principles can address challenges related to reliable aggregating and handling\
    \ of data\nfrom diverse sources, integrating multiple streams of information,\
    \ and employing ad-\nSensors 2023, 23, 7128\n34 of 38\nvanced computational methods\
    \ for data processing and analysis, which could enhance the\nunderstanding of\
    \ the subject and aid further studies.\nFurther decommissioning of data in the\
    \ future resulting from search—Tables 1–3\nmight be promising. The diverse and\

    \ cyber risks derived from the growing con-\nnectedness of Industry 4.0 has led\
    \ to the emergence of blockchain technology as a major innovation\nin supply chain\
    \ cybersecurity. The main purpose of this study is to identify and rank the signiﬁcant\n\
    barriers affecting the implementation of blockchain technology as a key component\
    \ of cyber supply\nchain risk management (CSCRM). This research relied on the\
    \ “interpretive structural modeling\n(ISM)” technique in the structure of a hierarchical\
    \ model to investigate the contextual relationships of\nidentiﬁed challenges for\
    \ blockchain adoption in CSCRM; it also classiﬁes the inﬂuential challenges\n\
    based on their driving and dependence powers. The results highlight that “cryptocurrency\
    \ volatility”\nis the challenge at the top level of the hierarchy, implying weak\
    \ driving power but it is strongly\ndependent on the other challenges. “Poor regulatory\
    \ provisions”, “technology immaturity”, “depen-\ndent on input information from\
    \ external oracles”, “scalability and bandwidth issues”, and “smart\ncontract\
    \ issues” are signiﬁcant challenges for the adoption of blockchain in cyber supply\
    \ chain risk\nmanagement and are located at the bottom level of the hierarchy\
    \ with higher driving power. The\nimplications for theory and practice of the\
    \ research are also highlighted.\nKeywords: blockchain technology; cyber supply\
    \ chain risk management; ISM; MICMAC\n1. Introduction\nThe vulnerability of international\
    \ supply chains to cyber-attacks, such as the ones on\nNatanz uranium enrichment\
    \ plant’s controller in Iran in November 2010 [1] and Norsk\nHydro’s operations\
    \ in the U.S. and Europe in 2019 [2], is becoming clear. “A cyberattack is\nany\
    \ disturbance to this interdependent network that leads to loss of functionality,\
    \ connec-\ntivity, or capacity” [3]. The cost of cyberattacks on Italian companies’\
    \ data in 2018 has been\nestimated at an average of EUR 3 million for each cyber-attack\
    \ [4].\nThe sources of cyber threats cover a lot of territories. The National\
    \ Institute of Stan-\ndards and Technology [5] reported several cyber concerns\
    \ leading to disruption in the\nsupply chain, such as the uncertainty of information\
    \ security practices by lower-tier suppli-\ners, vendors’ software or hardware\
    \ with some security vulnerabilities, risks of third-party\ndata storage, and\
    \ so on. Reference [6] also reported the ﬁrst cyber victims of denial-of-\nservice\
    \ attacks on the websites of corporations, such as eBay, Amazon, and CNN, designed\n\
    to disrupt the data trafﬁc of a targeted server. As an additional example, in\
    \ summer of 2017,\na major shipping line calculated the estimated cyber-attack\
    \ cost up of to Dollar 300 million,\nleading to some challenges to their clients’\
    \ operations [7].\nIn recent years, the components of the 4th industrial revolution,\
    \ such as Internet of\nthings (IoT), Cloud Computing (CC), Big Data Analytics\
    \ (BDA), Cyber-Physical Systems\n(CPS), and other automation technologies have\
    \ transformed the way of operations in the\nSustainability 2021, 13, 4672. https://doi.org/10.3390/su13094672\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability\nSustainability 2021, 13, 4672\n2\
    \ of 28\nsupply chain. However, more than 900 million IoT devices were expected\
    \ to be potentially\nunder threat of cyber-attacks in 2020 [8]. Reference [9]\
    \ also presented a comprehensive\nreview on cybersecurity attacks, including data\
    \ breach, tampering, Sybil attacks, malicious\ncode injection, and so on, for\
    \ IoT and industrial IoT devices.\nWith this in mind, relying on ICT and technical\
    \ security solutions such as passwords,\naccess controls, such as ﬁrewalls, and\
    \ intrusion detection methods are not sufﬁcient. This\nreﬂects a thought-provoking\
    \ fact that invites the cybersecurity community to go beyond\nthe traditional\
    \ approaches and be aware of innovative solutions to confront cyber threats\n\
    and adopt different potential technologies for securely executing supply chain\
    \ operations.\nWith the advent of new technologies, such as the implementation\
    \ of blockchain and\ndistributed ledger technologies (DLTs), the mitigation of\
    \ cyber risks in the end-to-end\nsupply chain is possible with the integrity of\
    \ data and systems [10,11].\nThe origin of DLTs is traced back to 1978 with a\
    \ fault-tolerant consensus mechanism for\nthe validation of information without\
    \ relying on the intermediary’s central authority in the\nsystems [12,13]. As\
    \ stated by Saur: “A distributed ledger is a type of digital data structure\n\
    residing across multiple computer devices, generally at geographically distinguished\n\
    locations” [14]. Distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) are a type of technology\
    \ that\nenables the keeping and sharing of records in a decentralized manner.\n\
    Blockchain technologies are currently the most popular variant form of distributed\n\
    ledger technologies. Blockchain is a cutting-edge technology that offers many\
    \ solutions to\novercome the challenges associated with CSCRM. Blockchain is a\
    \ decentralized, distributed,\nand shared digital ledger that is used to store\
    \ a copy of blocks of valid transactions across\nmany computers, so that no record\
    \ involved can be manipulated retroactively without\na breakdown of the chain\
    \ of blocks [15]. Blockchain can be described as a decentralized\ndatabase for\
    \ achieving information transparency and data security. Out of the numerous\n\
    ﬁelds of blockchain and distributed ledger technologies (BDLT), applications,\
    \ including\nﬁnance, healthcare [16,17], food [18,19], smart cities [20] and government\
    \ [15], and those\nrelated to cybersecurity have gained the attention of the research\
    \ community over recent\nyears [11,21–23]. The applications of blockchain in the\
    \ cyber-resilient supply chain in the\ncase of the automotive industry to guarantee\
    \ data transparency, operational efﬁciency,\ntraceability, diminishing costs,\
    \ and fewer human interventions were also highlighted in\nthe work of [24]. Blockchain-based\
    \ CSCRM can be enabled by integrating with some\nsmart technologies, such as Internet\
    \ of Things to solve privacy and security vulnerabili-\nties [25], big data analytics\
    \ and cloud computing to increase real-time information exchange\nand material\
    \ tracing by trusted users participating in the transactions [26,27]. Therefore,\n\
    BDLTs ensure resiliency, the provenance of products, transparency, and reduce\
    \ privacy\nleakage and fraudulent activities, providing trusted information inputs\
    \ and outputs for\nCSCRM initiatives. Potential beneﬁts of BDLT adoption include\
    \ a tamper-proof database,\nimproved cyber risk management, data privacy, auditability,\
    \ and the storage of immutable\ndata of a transaction through its intrinsic characteristics\
    \ to improve cyber risk supply\nchain management.\nSurprisingly, despite a promising\
    \ future and vast advantages, BDLTs have not taken\nover the supply chain sufﬁciently\
    \ to mitigate cyber risks. So far, the BDLT applications and\nﬁnancial beneﬁts,\
    \ transparency, and traceability requirements are mainly aligned in the\nliterature\
    \ and have received much more attention in the number of articles published by\n\
    scholars. The challenges for the diffusion of blockchain are also addressed in\
    \ a few studies,\nand most of these available studies are focused on the impediments\
    \ to blockchain adoption\nin a general way, not in a speciﬁc domain. For instance,\
    \ the statements in reference [28] try\nto discuss the scalability problems and\
    \ perceived lack of value in the nascent blockchain\nmarket. Reference [29] declares\
    \ that, despite the beneﬁts of distributed ledgers that are\nusually mentioned\
    \ in the literature, such as trust, integration, or transparency in the supply\n\
    chain, the implementation of this technology is unlikely. To the best of our knowledge,\n\
    there is not much research work focused on the intersection between cybersecurity,\
    \ BDLTs,\nSustainability 2021, 13, 4672\n3 of 28\nand the supply chain; none of\
    \ these studies empirically address the linkage to challenges\nthat impede the\
    \ adoption of blockchain technology in cyber supply chain risk management.\nTo\
    \ bridge the knowledge gap, the existing number of research articles indicate\
    \ that\nthere has been no study that has entirely focused on the various challenges\
    \ that affect the\nadoption of blockchain connected to the concept of cyber supply\
    \ chain risk management,\nwhich is something that is missing in the existing studies\
    \ and that attempts to depict a\nconceptual model of the hierarchical structural\
    \ relationship that is characterized by a two-\nphase methodology, namely (i)\
    \ a graph-based “Interpretive Structural Modeling” (ISM),\nto impose the linkage\
    \ among the CSCRM challenges, and (ii) a complimentary analysis,\nnamely “Cross-Impact\
    \ Matrix Multiplication to Classiﬁcation” (MICMAC), to classify the\nstrength\
    \ of the relationship between the CSCRM challenges based on their driving and\n\
    dependence power. The ﬁndings of this study are discussed alongside unique insights\
    \ into\nthe theoretical and practical implications of the investigated topic.\n\
    In this sense, this study sets out some questions as follows:\n•\nWhat are the\
    \ challenges of BDLT adoption for cyber supply chain risk management?\n•\nWhat\
    \ hierarchical relationships exist among identiﬁed challenges?\n•\nWhich challenges\
    \ have more driving power and which challenges have more depen-\ndency power on\
    \ the adoption of BDLT technologies in CSCRM?\nTo address these questions, the\
    \ paper is structured as follows. Following the introduc-\ntion and the literature\
    \ review, the adopted research methodology and research design are\npresented.\
    \ The ﬁndings obtained from the analysis, and the theoretical and managerial\n\
    implications of the study are then discussed. Final remarks, limitations, and\
    \ directions for\nfuture research conclude the paper.\n2. Literature Review\n\
    2.1. Supply Chain Risk Management\nOver the past decade, our knowledge and awareness\
    \ of supply chain risk management\n(SCRM) have risen due to technological and\
    \ market turbulence, volatile customer demand,\nalong with competitive intensity\
    \ [30]. A deﬁnition of supply chain risk is “the variation in\nthe distribution\
    \ of possible supply chain outcomes, their likelihoods, and their subjective\n\
    values” [31]. According to [32–34], the most common disruption risks affecting\
    \ the supply\nchain and, signiﬁcantly, its performance are related to natural\
    \ and manmade disasters (e.g.,\nearthquakes, hurricanes and ﬂoods), cyber threats\
    \ (human errors, failures and terrorism),\nwhile operational risks are related\
    \ to a company’s reduced ability to produce and supply\nproducts and services\
    \ [35]. Operational risks also include capacity constraints, supply and\ndemand\
    \ uncertainty, information management risk, and business interruption [36].\n\
    Different innovative methods have been adopted to identify cyber threats in the\
    \ supply\nchain, which is the ﬁrst phase in the supply chain risk management approach\
    \ [34,37].\nReference [38] states that a shift from the traditional information\
    \ technology infrastructure\nto Industry 4.0 systems makes it possible to automate\
    \ the identiﬁcation of cyber risks and\nexplore the effects of such systems. The\
    \ fragility of the supply chain is evidenced by some\ncyber incidents, varying\
    \ from counterfeiting, fraud, and data manipulation to the visibility\nof data\
    \ across the supply chain.\nThe basis of these increased risks has led to the\
    \ cyber supply chain risk management\nconcepts that constitute the main objective\
    \ of this paper.\n2.2. Cyber Supply Chain Risk Management\nCyber supply chain\
    \ risk management (CSCRM) is emerging as a new “management\nconstruct resulting\
    \ from the fusion of approaches, methods, and practices from the ﬁelds\nof cybersecurity,\
    \ information risk management, and supply chain management”. Such\napproaches\
    \ and practices lead to reshaping relationships between organizations and gov-\n\
    ernments, improving the integration of cyber–physical systems, and establishing\
    \ standards\nand protocols [39]. Building on the deﬁnition by [40], the term CSCRM\
    \ was coined to refer\nto the policies, procedures, and controls to protect the\
    \ operations of a supply chain from\nSustainability 2021, 13, 4672\n4 of 28\n\
    cyber and information risks. This concept requires a comprehensive assessment\
    \ of dynamic\ncapabilities, high-level technical skills, and human elements across\
    \ the supply chain to\nprevent and deal with the outcome of disruptions deriving\
    \ from the massive amount of\nconnectivity of today’s operational systems [41].\
    \ The aim of CSCRM is to gain security,\nreliability, and safety, along with the\
    \ broader objectives of trustworthiness, integrity, and\nquality [42].\nThe challenges\
    \ faced by global companies in successfully implementing CSCRM are\nlinked to\
    \ a large number of suppliers in an organization’s supply base [43] (Bode and\n\
    Wagner, 2015), to the growing technological change and evolving threats, and training\n\
    programs for security and technical personnel to identify and mitigate risks [44].\
    \ To add to\nthese growing complexities of CSCRM, standards and guidelines, regulatory\
    \ frameworks,\nand non-transparent supply chain partners in the cyber space are\
    \ constantly changing [39,45].\nIn this new area, a holistic approach through\
    \ CSCRM, combining processes, people, and\ntechnology, is considered a necessity\
    \ to deal with the challenges for enhancing cybersecurity.\nIn light of the abovementioned\
    \ concept of CSCRM, cybersecurity models need to\ntake into account the technological,\
    \ organizational, or environmental requirements during\nlong-term planning to\
    \ confront cyber and information risks to achieve cybersecurity.\n2.3. Blockchain\
    \ and Distributed Ledger Technologies\nDistributed technologies are a database\
    \ applied to share or record data based on\nvarious distributed ledgers across\
    \ multiple nodes in different geographic areas, accessible\nby multiple participants,\
    \ of which the blockchain is the most popular one. Each device or\nsystem in the\
    \ network is called a node. Unlike centralized systems, distributed ledgers do\n\
    not have any central location to store information [46]. The ﬁrst attempt to implement\
    \ the\nDLT was in aircraft operations, where the ﬁrst primitive DLT with a consensus\
    \ mechanism\nwas applied to deal with the cyber risks derived from some automatic\
    \ errors in the system’s\ncomponents clocks that would have led to an exchange\
    \ of incorrect information and the\nlikely inability to schedule internal aircraft\
    \ tasks, and ﬁnally the loss of functionality of the\naircraft systems [12].\n\
    The concept of blockchain was invented in 2008 as a platform entitled Bitcoin\
    \ by\nSatoshi Nakamoto [47]. Blockchain technology is widely evolved from blockchain\
    \ 1.0,\nwhich led to its ﬁrst application for cryptocurrency purposes with Bitcoin;\
    \ blockchain 2.0,\nwhich relied on the execution of smart contracts to the Ethereum\
    \ for the transaction of\ndigital assets; blockchain 3.0, which is based on DApps,\
    \ a decentralized application that\navoids centralized infrastructure and runs\
    \ on a distributed network; to blockchain 4.0,\nmaking blockchain applicable in\
    \ business cases [48–52]. Fundamentally, blockchain is a\nchain containing a growing\
    \ list of data about transactions, called blocks, which are added\nin chronological\
    \ order and cryptographically linked together. According to [53], blockchain\n\
    “is a new organizing paradigm for the discovery, valuation, and transfer of all\
    \ quanta\n(discrete units) of anything, and potentially for the coordination of\
    \ all human activity on a\nmuch larger scale than has been possible before”. Blockchain\
    \ works by relying on a peer-to-\npeer (P2P) topology, and new data records are\
    \ added to the network through a consensus\nmechanism based on authentication\
    \ and validation from multiple participants [54]. In the\ncontext of a block structure\
    \ in the chain, each block is identiﬁed by three fundamental\nelements, which\
    \ are as follows: the cryptographic hash algorithm on the header of the\nblock,\
    \ the timestamp which reports time for each transaction, and a Merkle tree to\
    \ store all\nthe transaction with authenticity, integrity, and consistency [55].\n\
    Transactions constitute the main core of the block records. When a user wants\
    \ to add\na new transaction to the ledger as a new block, the new block is received\
    \ by all other nodes,\nwhich accept it according to a consensus mechanism. The\
    \ accepted block is then generated\nto the whole network. Each new block contains\
    \ a hash of its header and connects to the\nprevious block in the chain through\
    \ cryptography [56].\nThe concept of a Merkle tree based on the hashes was coined\
    \ in 1987 with the publica-\ntion of a paper entitled “A digital signature based\
    \ on conventional encryption function”\nSustainability 2021, 13, 4672\n5 of 28\n\
    by [57]. Merkle trees are also one of the crucial components of blockchain technology\n\
    and allow a huge amount of data to be stored in a single hash value, known as\
    \ a Merkle\nroot [58]. The root hash of the hash tree is used to detect tampered\
    \ data and enables a\nsecure and timely validation of the transactions [25]. Furthermore,\
    \ the block header hash\nallows the transactions to connect to the chain by embedding\
    \ the prior block hash in the\ncurrent block header. In this way, every transaction\
    \ remains tamper-proof and cannot be\nmanipulated or removed, and with any change\
    \ in a speciﬁc block, all subsequent blocks\nwill be invalid in the chain [59].\n\
    2.4. BDLTs Key Capabilities for Cybersecurity\nBlockchain and DLTs are a promising\
    \ technology, predicted to span many more sectors\nover the next few years [60].\
    \ The prosperity of BDLTs pertains to their inherent features;\nthe range of advantages\
    \ in the realization of the cybersecurity properties they provide to\ntheir members\
    \ is presented below.\n•\nDecentralization: Unlike a traditional centralized transaction\
    \ system where transac-\ntions are veriﬁed by a trusted centralized agency, such\
    \ as a central bank or a govern-\nment, in a decentralized infrastructure, two\
    \ parties can access the database without\nthe need for a third party to keep\
    \ records or perform authorization. Within traditional\nsystems, risks related\
    \ to human error or criminal activity remain unidentiﬁed. Fur-\nthermore, such\
    \ centralization can have several downsides, including more charges,\nlower overall\
    \ performance, and various failures in the systems on the part of service\nproviders\
    \ [61,62]. Distributed ledgers record transactions without the association of\
    \ a\nthird party, which is helpful in the reduction of service costs, the improvement\
    \ of the\nefﬁciency of the chain, and mitigation of the risk of system failures\
    \ [63].\n•\nAvailability: The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)\
    \ deﬁnes\navailability as “ensuring timely and reliable access to and use of information”\
    \ [64].\nCyberattacks start to impact availability of technology services with\
    \ vulnerabilities,\nsuch as counterfeiting, theft, fraud, data manipulation, or\
    \ falsiﬁcation [65]. The\nDLT solution based on its decentralization and peer-to-peer\
    \ characteristics makes it\nmore difﬁcult for criminals to disrupt. However, one\
    \ of the most common attacks,\nknown as distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks,\
    \ can target internet services and\nnetworks with more trafﬁc than the server\
    \ or network can handle and, hence, some\ndisruptions to blockchain solutions.\
    \ As a result, with the availability of information in\ndecentralized platforms\
    \ of DLTs, a rise in DDoS attacks could be observed [66].\n•\nData Access and\
    \ Disclosure: According to reference [67], blockchain is a “secure\npublic ledger\
    \ platform shared by all parties through the Internet or an alternative\ndistributed\
    \ network of computers”. Blocks with sets of information are shared between\n\
    participants. The participants have the ability to share records and have limited\
    \ access\nto their relevant transactions whenever they need them [68]. The decentralized\
    \ nature\nof blockchain technology contributes to information sharing among relevant\
    \ parties,\nhelping transactions with high security from potentially targeted\
    \ attacks or complex\nincidents [69].\n•\nTraceability: BDLTs provide a wide range\
    \ of capabilities, including traceable and\ntamper-resistant records, a high level\
    \ of traceability with trusted information, acces-\nsibility, and the visibility\
    \ of data provenance [70,71]. All blockchain transactions are\ngiven an exact\
    \ timestamp when the transactions are added to the chain [46]. Such an\ninherited\
    \ characteristic of blockchain enhances traceability and authenticity for the\n\
    transaction of products, data, and interactions [72].\n•\nTransparency: Current\
    \ centralized systems in the supply chain deal with issues\nsuch as fraudulent\
    \ activities, privacy and security errors, lack of transparency and\ntrust [73].\
    \ Blockchain technologies are potential enablers of a trusted and efﬁcient\nsupply\
    \ chain and can improve transparency and bring high visibility, authenticity,\n\
    and availability to all the stakeholders in the network [74,75]. The secure and\
    \ tamper-\nresistant mechanism of blockchain paves the way for greater transparency,\
    \ increasing\nSustainability 2021, 13, 4672\n6 of 28\nthe trustworthiness of transactions\
    \ through interaction and access to the network\namong users [76].\n•\nPrivacy\
    \ and Security: Blockchains or cryptographic-based distributed ledgers allow\n\
    more integrity and information security than traditional databases because blockchain\n\
    connects devices to the networks and members to devices, and encrypted transactions\n\
    are added to the chain with the authorization of all participants without the\
    \ need for\ndata disclosure [23]. So, given the abovementioned advantage of the\
    \ BDLTs, it is very\ndifﬁcult to hack this impenetrable technology.\n•\nImmutability:\
    \ Immutability in the blockchain refers to the high ability of technology\nto\
    \ remain censorship-resistant and indelible [77]. Immutability enables the transforma-\n\
    tion of each new transaction into the chain and approval by a consensus mechanism.\n\
    In addition, all the historical registered operations are immutable; therefore,\
    \ any ma-\nnipulation and forgery of data records would need a cyber-attacker\
    \ to break most of a\nnetwork’s nodes [74].\n•\nReduced Overall Cost: Blockchain\
    \ technologies help reduce the overall cost because\nof the direct transfer of\
    \ transactions without the need for a bank or other third party.\nCosts related\
    \ to documentation, tax services, auditing, and governance can potentially\nbe\
    \ reduced. Subsequently, the reduction of transaction costs that can be supported\
    \ by\nblockchain technology would lead to eliminating cybersecurity incidents\
    \ [78,79].\n•\nData Quality: BDLT does not ensure the quality of data but any\
    \ blocks that contain\nlow accuracy and quality of data will not be allowed to\
    \ add to the chain. Blockchain\nguarantees transformation of accurate and impenetrable\
    \ data faster than any other\nsystem, and facilitates entities in exchanging information\
    \ in a protected way [66].\n•\nDistributed: The validated transactions and updated\
    \ records are synchronized into\nblocks for processing and protocols and supporting\
    \ infrastructures allow every node\nor participant in different locations to receive\
    \ a real-time transaction [80].\n2.5. Applications of BDLTs Adoption in CSCRM\n\
    This section provides a comprehensive identiﬁcation of the speciﬁc supply chain\n\
    functions that can be connected by the use of blockchain and cybersecurity. The\
    \ prior con-\ntributions of blockchain technologies adoption in the supply chain\
    \ management have been\nhighlighted with notable examples, including improved\
    \ data security and smart contracts;\ndigital trust and supply chain relationship\
    \ management; the tracking of the possession\nof goods and the identity of suppliers\
    \ [81,82]; governance and legal frameworks for the\nexecution of blockchain [83];\
    \ physical access control management based on Hyperledger\nFabric platform and\
    \ the security of IoT networks [84,85]; and integration with cutting edge\ntechnologies\
    \ for storing and transferring encrypted data to the edge nodes [86]. Based on\n\
    the most cybersecurity focused blockchain applications, “Internet of things” and\
    \ “Transac-\ntion data” have received the most attention from scholars interested\
    \ in the intersection of\nBDLT and cybersecurity and supply chain. In order to\
    \ understand how the blockchain can\nbe adapted to support the security of IoT\
    \ devices, reference [87] presented a cloud-based\nIoT platform in the combination\
    \ of blockchain for executing cryptographic transactions\nthrough smart contracts\
    \ to securely track data management and prevent malware infections\nin IoT devices.\
    \ Other applications of blockchain in the form of authorities management,\nsecure\
    \ communication sessions, access control, and prevention of bandwidth saturation\
    \ are\nprovided in some contributions [85,88,89]. However, apart from the integration\
    \ advantages\nin the IoT with BDLTs, there are some challenges arising from different\
    \ elements, such as\nthe low computational power and scalability issues of IoT\
    \ devices for a huge amount of\ndata transmission, and the inherent latency of\
    \ blockchain technology [90].\nIn another class of blockchain adoption in CSCRM,\
    \ data management is one of the most\npromising features of the blockchain. The\
    \ management and protection of transaction data\nhave become increasingly uncontrollable\
    \ in a distributed environment. Implementations\nand applications based on this\
    \ technology improve secure data sharing among stakeholders\nin the supply chain\
    \ and are aimed at secure and veriﬁable data management [91]. Although\nSustainability\
    \ 2021, 13, 4672\n7 of 28\nsuccessful and interoperable communications have not\
    \ yet reached a secure level between\nparties in the supply chain, there are some\
    \ examples in the literature from the cross-\norganizational data management perspective.\
    \ In the study, [92] designed a DLT with a\ncertiﬁcation or endorsement mechanism\
    \ which allows the exchange of consumer data\nwithout revealing the information\
    \ in the pharmaceutical supply chain. The result shows\nthat blockchain has the\
    \ potential to mitigate the counterfeiting issues with the cross-supply\nchain\
    \ workﬂow management while maintaining transactional privacy.\nBlockchain is also\
    \ disrupting the human resource sector [93,94] by revolutionizing\nworking procedures\
    \ and employment document storage [94]. In the case of data storage in\nthe form\
    \ of decentralized and non-reversible platforms, [56] addressed the importance\
    \ of\ninformation sharing by a governance model, considering blockchain architecture\
    \ among\nparties in the supply chain. Additionally, access control mechanisms,\
    \ metadata supporting\nkey functions, and the encryption and decryption of data\
    \ are the key concepts for their\nblockchain architectural design. Blockchain\
    \ applications appear to offer signiﬁcant trust to\nthe participants or connected\
    \ devices in a supply chain network. Reference [95] proposed\nand developed a\
    \ decentralized microgrid model for distributing transactions between\nproducer\
    \ and consumer without the regulation of a central authorization. Their BDLT\n\
    mechanism enables data distribution for certiﬁed and trusted parties by using\
    \ attribute-\nbased signatures of multiple producers.\nBDLTs are also considered\
    \ an opportunity for protecting the security of data that\nencounter malicious\
    \ cyberattacks [96–100].\nCollaborative IDS (CIDS) [101] is an intrusion detection\
    \ system using smart contracts\nto address data privacy issues. Self Organizing\
    \ Maps (SOMs) [102] are artiﬁcial networks\nconsisting of thousands of nodes that\
    \ can be applied in BDLT systems to cluster categor-\nical data to the entire\
    \ nodes for enhancing data privacy and conﬁdentiality, as well as\nmonitoring\
    \ the blockchain. In [103], the authors proposed a cryptographic system known\n\
    as Zerocoin to verify transactions with anonymity and user privacy. Zerocash [104]\
    \ is a\ndecentralized currency to guarantee privacy preservation by applying zero-knowledge\n\
    proof variant (zkSNARKs) and provide user privacy by protecting details of the\
    \ transac-\ntion. Reference [105] highlighted the fact that the capabilities of\
    \ machine learning can be\ncombined with blockchains to explore malware activities.\n\
    Despite multiple contributions highlighting the importance given to capabilities\
    \ of\nblockchain technologies from the perspective of privacy and security concerns\
    \ in dif-\nferent types of BDLTs, e.g., public, private, and smart contract, there\
    \ is still a need\nto be cautious about the security challenges facing BDL adoption.\
    \ In spite of the im-\nmutable nature of distributed ledger technologies, they\
    \ are still vulnerable to cyberattacks.\nTransaction anonymity and transparency\
    \ can be obtained by blockchain, but this tech-\nnology cannot guarantee the privacy\
    \ of data, and identity fraud and data breaches can\noccur anytime [106,107].\
    \ For example, anonymity and privacy concerns are rising in the\nblockchain due\
    \ to the disclosure risk of users’ identity. The users’ transaction information,\n\
    such as the sender and receiver address, even if pseudonymous, and the value can\
    \ be\npublicly accessed and be visible to all network participants. In this case,\
    \ all personal user\ninformation, such as transaction contents (e.g., amounts,\
    \ account balance, and spending\npatterns), can be tracked under unexpected failures\
    \ or malicious cyberattacks [108].\nSeveral works also focused on the risk of\
    \ privacy leakage in smart contracts, which\nposes some challenges for data conﬁdentiality\
    \ and privacy for sharing data [109,110].\nReference [111] focused on the privacy\
    \ of transactions in the smart contract platforms\nand proposed Hawk, a decentralized\
    \ smart contract system, which gives an efﬁcient\ncryptographic protocol maintaining\
    \ transactional privacy. ShadowEth [109] is a private\nsmart contract on Ethereum\
    \ to execute and store all metadata in an off-chain trusted\nexecution environment\
    \ called TEE-DS.\nIn the case of data privacy management, the European Union (EU)\
    \ presented the\ngeneral data protection regulation (GDPR) in May 2018, which\
    \ addresses regulatory hurdles\nSustainability 2021, 13, 4672\n8 of 28\nand contributes\
    \ to the development of international guidelines and regulations to facilitate\n\
    the use of BDLTs for all organizations.\nCurrently, BDLTs are applied to a wide\
    \ range of digital and virtual ﬁnancial markets,\nmarket predictions, and capital\
    \ investments [112]. The numerous types of cybersecurity\nthreats can occur during\
    \ information, physical, and ﬁnancial ﬂows between supply chain\nstakeholders\
    \ due to technical vulnerabilities in the systems [113]. Blockchain is expected\
    \ to\nbring some advantages to customers, industrial and commercial institutions,\
    \ and society\nas a whole [114]. For instance, to facilitate future market prediction,\
    \ Augur [115] is a\ndecentralized protocol for the global prediction market, enabling\
    \ users to trade shares\nwithout the need for a single entity. Plasma [116] is\
    \ a “proposed framework for incentivized\nand enforced execution of smart contracts,\
    \ which is scalable to a signiﬁcant amount of state\nupdates per second (potentially\
    \ billions) enabling the blockchain to be able to represent\na signiﬁcant amount\
    \ of decentralized ﬁnancial applications worldwide”. Gnosis [117] is\na platform\
    \ that enables the trade of digital assets and cryptocurrencies on Ethereum’s\n\
    new market mechanisms, and it is claimed to be a reliable forecasting tool for\
    \ increasing\nknowledge of upcoming events in ﬁnance, government, and among other\
    \ sectors.\nDespite the hype around different BDLT platforms, the studies conﬁrm\
    \ that the\ncomplexity of ﬁnancial ﬂows can lead to some difﬁculties in managing\
    \ cyber supply\nchain risks. As a result, security violation and cryptocurrency\
    \ volatility, such as volatile\ndigital coins and hacking wallets of cryptocurrency\
    \ exchange, have diverse effects on the\nreputation of BDLT platforms [118].\n\
    3. Challenges for Blockchain/BDLT Adoption in CSCRM\nIn previous studies, researchers\
    \ and practitioners have made an effort to point out\nthe potential of BDLTs based\
    \ on risk reduction, transparency, traceability, peer-to-peer\ntransactions, data\
    \ safety, and decentralization, which are the signiﬁcant objectives of supply\n\
    chain management [71,119–121]. The main purpose of this paper lies at the intersection\
    \ of\ncybersecurity and blockchoichain/BDLTs. Although the literature on cybersecurity\
    \ is not\nentirely new, there is plenty of room to explore it in the context of\
    \ supply chain literature.\nIn the literature, cybersecurity and blockchain/BDLTs\
    \ align to address barriers related\nto Internet of things, data sharing, the\
    \ prediction marketplace, cryptocurrency, privacy,\nand security [122–124], whilst\
    \ the implementation of BDLTs for cyber supply chain risk\nmanagement is still\
    \ at the pilot stage. Stakeholders have to deal with numerous challenges\nduring\
    \ the adoption process of blockchain disrupting the existing CSCRM. This should\n\
    be a driving force for researchers and practitioners to be always ready to promote\
    \ and\nregulate new technologies, as per the risk maturity models, interoperability\
    \ capabilities,\nsupport of leadership, and different governance policies. Sixteen\
    \ challenges identiﬁed from\nthe literature review in the adoption process of\
    \ BDLTs into a cyber secure supply chain are\ndiscussed as follows, and are shown\
    \ in Table 1.\n3.1. Immature, Early Stage of Development\nThe concept of technological\
    \ maturity is deﬁned as the readiness level for blockchain\ntechnology adoption\
    \ since its ﬁrst appearance. There is a potential for SMEs to understand\nthe\
    \ value of mature technology and adopt it to enrich their activities [125]. Despite\
    \ the\nhype around the use of BDLTs, these technologies are still in the early\
    \ stage of development.\nThe immaturity of blockchain technology in the form of\
    \ security vulnerabilities, a single\npoint of failure, and the lack of experiential\
    \ knowledge may lead to some ambiguities in\nadopting and implementing the technology\
    \ [53].\n3.2. Scalability and Bandwidth Issues\nScalability and bandwidth issues\
    \ describe network throughput limitations. According\nto [126], “Scalability is\
    \ the capability of blockchain calculating processes to apply in a vast\nrange\
    \ of potentialities and to fulﬁll these aims”. Scalability has been described\
    \ as becoming\na major issue with the increasing number of entities, transactions,\
    \ block sizes, and long\nSustainability 2021, 13, 4672\n9 of 28\nlatency, preventing\
    \ large-scale blockchain implementation [127]. One example to consider\nis that\
    \ if Bitcoin proceeded with the same amount of transaction volume as VISA, it\
    \ would\nneed to replicate data in the entire network, posing a massive challenge\
    \ to the data capacity\nand bandwidth [128]. Next, from a technical perspective,\
    \ scalability is considered to be\none of the most critical constraints in BDLTs\
    \ adoption. The scalability of BDLTs has not\nyet reached a mark with market demand.\
    \ Indeed, scalability problems are ascribed to\nthe large amounts of transactional\
    \ data generated from multiple resources in the supply\nchain operations, including\
    \ different geographical locations, types of goods, and various\nbusiness members.\
    \ The solution to managing scalability through increasing the size of the\nblock\
    \ is based on an assumption that the throughput will be higher, but at the same\
    \ time, it\nconﬂicts with the security of the main chain due to generate and propagate\
    \ slate blocks.\nTherefore, potential schemes need to be presented to enhance\
    \ the scalability of blockchain\nsystems, while preventing security concerns.\n\
    3.3. Wasted Resources or High Energy Consumption\nOne of the critical drawbacks\
    \ impeding the adoption of blockchain technology is\ncomputational power and energy\
    \ consumption [108,129,130] and refers to the energy\nconsumed in handling transactions\
    \ by all the miners [100]. In some consensus mechanisms,\nsuch as proof of work\
    \ (PoW), all blockchain nodes perform a high computational power to\nmine the\
    \ next blocks [108]. However, PoW is considered to consume an enormous level\n\
    of electricity, because mining each block depends on intensive computations and\
    \ lots of\nhashing and encryption by all blockchain miners. In this respect, researchers\
    \ have proposed\nalternative mechanisms, such as proof of stake (PoS), to avoid\
    \ high resource consumption,\nwhere the probability of successful mining with\
    \ PoS depends on the invested stakes by\nnodes in the system. This consensus process\
    \ relies on the hashing operation and a higher\ncoin age, which refers to the\
    \ amount of time to hold onto coins without spending or moving\nthem, which will\
    \ lead to a decrease in energy waste [131]. Another example is delegated\nproof\
    \ of stake (DPoS) that contributes to obtain a higher speed of transactions and\
    \ low\nelectricity consumption [132]. However, the main criticism of PoS and DPoS\
    \ is the lack\nof rigorous security analysis [108]. Practical byzantine fault\
    \ tolerance (PBFT) algorithms\ndepend on the honesty from different validator\
    \ nodes of a network that may affect both\nspeed and scalability and is not acceptable\
    \ for systems with thousands of entities [133]. As\na result of this, it is interesting\
    \ to make more energy-efﬁcient consensus mechanisms to\nmake BDLTs more adoptable.\n\
    3.4. Throughput and Low Performance\nLow transaction throughput and the limited\
    \ rate for processing the transactions at the\nblock are other important issues\
    \ of blockchain adoption.\nOne example to consider is that in contrast to modern\
    \ credit card platforms that\nhandle 7000 transactions per second, the throughput\
    \ of the Bitcoin blockchain is around\n7 transactions per second and a decentralized\
    \ open-source blockchain platform like\nEthereum can only handle 20 transactions\
    \ on average [130]. Moreover, by increasing\nthe volume of the data, the propagation\
    \ delay in blocks will be a considerable issue and\nthe throughput will become\
    \ more and more difﬁcult. The time needed to synchronize\ntransactions or obtain\
    \ a consensus among all clients when involving and running the\nsystem is an issue\
    \ [134]. This is critical for IoT devices and industries in the supply chain\n\
    and their need for high-performance transaction processing with low computational\
    \ re-\nsources [135]. Recently, new solutions have been proposed to avoid the\
    \ aforementioned\nproblems, such as consensus mechanisms applied in Hyperledger,\
    \ Stellar, R3, and Ripple,\nto improve throughput and performance, reducing the\
    \ block interval time. However, such\nlimitations need to be considered by proper\
    \ schemes so as to increase the throughput of\nblockchain systems.\nSustainability\
    \ 2021, 13, 4672\n10 of 28\n3.5. Lack of Standardization and Interoperability\n\
    Another major challenge is the lack of interoperability with other organizations’\n\
    databases, which often leads to multiple risks of errors and failures of various\n\
    blockchain platforms.\nThe Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)\
    \ deﬁnes interoperability as\n“the ability of two or more systems or components\
    \ to exchange information and to use the\ninformation that has been exchanged”\
    \ [136]. It is considered a determinant factor affecting\nthe adoption of blockchain-based\
    \ CSCRM technologies. Therefore, more efforts are needed\nto enable the interoperability\
    \ of innovative BDLTs with legacy systems and to make the\nsystem compatible with\
    \ the existing IT systems. Furthermore, it is recommended to follow\nthe standards\
    \ to make the interoperability of different infrastructures easier; this allows\
    \ a\nbetter assessment of the interface between blockchain and the real world.\n\
    3.6. Privacy and Information Disclosure Issues\nPrivacy concerns refer to the\
    \ anonymity of counterparts to the extent to which infor-\nmation can be shared\
    \ with a particular entity [137]. For example, anonymity and privacy\nconcerns\
    \ are rising in the blockchain due to the disclosure risk of users’ identities.\
    \ The\nuser’s transaction information, such as the sender and receiver address,\
    \ even if pseudony-\nmous, and the value, can be publicly accessed and be visible\
    \ to all network participants. In\nthis case, all personal user information, such\
    \ as transaction contents (e.g., amounts, account\nbalance, and spending patterns),\
    \ can be tracked under unexpected failures or malicious\ncyberattacks [108]. As\
    \ a result, privacy data can be conducted and achieved with the legal\nand regulatory\
    \ frameworks, along with laws for data privacy.\n3.7. Criminal Activity, Malicious\
    \ Attacks\nCriminal activities and malicious attacks were found to be challenges\
    \ in the techno-\nlogical context. Different types of attacks, such as denial-of-service\
    \ (DoS), spooﬁng attacks,\nsecurity threats, Sybil attacks, and double-spending\
    \ attacks, can affect the performance\nof BDLT networks [138–140]. In this case,\
    \ the best security and privacy policies must be\nincluded as an integral part\
    \ of the design and implementation of industrial BDLT applica-\ntions by designers\
    \ and developers [141]. In addition, within the scope of these applications,\n\
    provisions, including different levels of protection, must be provided [142].\n\
    3.8. Dependent on Input Information from External Oracles\nThe blockchain oracle\
    \ problem is one of the most signiﬁcant challenges triggering dif-\nﬁculties for\
    \ the trustworthiness of information written in smart contracts [45,143]. “Oracles\n\
    are centralized and trusted third parties that constitute the interface between\
    \ blockchains\nand the real world” [144]. A smart contract often relies on information\
    \ from external oracles\nthat collect data from different sources, such as big\
    \ data applications, Internet of things,\nand RFID sensors [24]. Indeed, it is\
    \ likely that these external oracles will be most attractive\nto criminals.\n\

    \ concern in the adoption of BDLTs in the supply chain is in terms of the\nlack\
    \ of support to end-users and sufﬁcient platforms and tools. Blockchain platforms\n\
    run under standards that are different from the deﬁned way for existing systems,\
    \ which\nposes some challenges for users [128]. An application programming interface\
    \ (API) is\na set of rules and protocols that allows applications to integrate\
    \ with each other; this\nneeds to be developed to make BDLTs easier to adopt for\
    \ users [178]. Therefore, to make\nblockchain more successful, the users’ acceptance\
    \ should be considered during blockchain\nimplementation. Furthermore, customer\
    \ awareness and understanding of blockchain\ntechnology by providing professional\
    \ training programs may be the key to moving forward\nwith the productivity in\
    \ organizations’ supply chains, as well as securely control them\nagainst cyber\
    \ risks [179,180].\n3.10. Suitability of Blockchain\nBDLTs do not cover all facets\
    \ of the supply chain operations in terms of cybersecurity\nsolutions. On the\
    \ other hand, blockchain technology may not add any value to all core\nbusiness\
    \ use cases or processes. Blockchain or cryptographic-based distributed ledgers\n\
    are a viable solution for trusted transactions among trustless entities or a permanent\n\
    historical record [181]. Therefore, before adopting BDLT-enabled solutions, practitioners\n\
    should assess the suitability of applying blockchain using the use-case requirements\
    \ [182].\nDifferent blockchain types (i.e., permissioned or permissionless) have\
    \ been leveraged over\nthe last couple of years, allowing industries to use them\
    \ for their speciﬁc domains.\n3.11. Cryptocurrency Volatility\nAn additional weakness\
    \ is the volatility in crypto markets, which can be a challenge\nin terms of blockchain\
    \ adoption in a short time [24]. For example, security violation and\ncryptocurrency\
    \ volatility, such as volatile digital coins and hacking wallets of cryptocur-\n\
    rency exchange, have diverse effects on the reputation of BDLTs platforms [118].\
    \ Thus, it\nwill take years for payment merchants based on blockchain platforms\
    \ to be accepted by a\nlarge number of users [166,167].\n3.12. Smart Contract\
    \ Issues\nA smart contract is “a piece of code that executes a speciﬁc business\
    \ logic when a\ncertain condition is met” [183]. This means that smart contracts\
    \ are automatically executed\nwhen certain conditions in a contract or an agreement\
    \ are met. Relying on the program-\nming languages, a smart contract could describe\
    \ all conditions in the contract and the\ncharacteristics of blockchain [168].\
    \ The complexity of programming languages and chal-\nlenges of writing correct\
    \ smart contracts are among the difﬁculties that face researchers and\ndevelopers\
    \ during blockchain adoption. For example, it has been reported that there was\n\
    an average ﬁnancial loss of USD 60 million due to the distributed autonomous organization\n\
    (DAO) attack, which led to the transfer of money to an adversary account in 2016\
    \ [184].\nThus, more research is necessary to tackle the aforementioned issues.\n\
    Sustainability 2021, 13, 4672\n12 of 28\n3.13. Quantum Resilience\nCryptographic\
    \ primitives in blockchain are classiﬁed into two basic functions, includ-\ning\
    \ hashes and public-key encryption for signing transactions [123]. With the advent\
    \ of\nquantum computers, it may already be time to start worrying about the breaking\
    \ of hashing\nalgorithms. The performance and security in the blockchain are affected\
    \ by this due to the\nease of cracking the cryptographic keys using a brute force\
    \ algorithm [107]. Signiﬁcant\nefforts are currently being made to make the cryptographic\
    \ keys stronger. For example, on\nthe topic of post-quantum cryptography, research\
    \ institutions such as NIST are calling for\nproposals, and expect to launch the\
    \ early report between 2022 and 2024 [185].\n3.14. Lack of Trust\nTrust is another\
    \ critical obstacle to success for future growth in BDLT adoption. Trust\nrefers\
    \ to the “reliability of information provided by trade partners, or the safety\
    \ and\nsecurity of the data managed by a central authority” [82]. Therefore, the\
    \ challenge of\ntrust is broader than just a lack of trust in the blockchain technology\
    \ suppliers; there\nis also the problem of loss or breach of data during the distribution\
    \ of the technology.\nAlthough several studies have been carried out to solve\
    \ the barrier of trust in supply chain\nmanagement, the problems that are arising\
    \ are still difﬁcult problems for the BDLTs used\nnowadays [152,172,186].\n3.15.\
    \ Users’ Credential Loss\nBDLTs have the potential to create trust within the\
    \ network with the conﬁrmation\nof the validity of the user’s credentials and\
    \ the identity issuer to attest the data inside\nthe credential, without revealing\
    \ the actual data. However, another major issue that can\noccur when applying\
    \ BDLTs is in the case of users’ credentials loss, e.g., wallet, keys, and\nsome\
    \ private/public information due to loss, theft, and expiration [174]. Therefore,\
    \ a high\nvolume of data, e.g., conditions of products and the expected date of\
    \ delivery, could be\nexposed when a cryptographic key is compromised. Alternatively,\
    \ a criminal party could\nappear to modify data to gain the beneﬁt, e.g., manipulation\
    \ of the main liable party to\nrefuse the penalties. Ultimately, this scenario\
    \ indicates how important it is to securitize\nthese keys across BDLTs [118].\n\
    3.16. Poor Clarity Regulatory Provisions\nPoor clarity regulatory provisions have\
    \ been considered determinants among the\nmain barriers affecting the adoption\
    \ of blockchain [187,188]. This challenge is deﬁned\nas “the policies and regulations\
    \ provided by government to regulate and monitor the\nindustries for the usage\
    \ of new technology” [177]. It was identiﬁed as a means to overcome\nthe organizational\
    \ readiness barrier. Given the necessity for guidance and support from the\ngovernment\
    \ during the adoption of blockchain in CSCRM in different ways and capacities,\n\
    in the form of providing proper infrastructures, capabilities, and the deﬁnition\
    \ of laws\nand regulations to authenticate digital records, executive departments\
    \ and agencies could\nbe able to monitor and validate transactions, determine\
    \ the validity of contracts and\nagreements between parties, and, lastly, deﬁne\
    \ and develop the standards to track the\nprocesses under the blockchain platforms\
    \ [142].\n4. Methodology and Research Design\nThe aim of this research is to identify\
    \ key challenges of BDLT adoption and provide\na hierarchical framework of challenges\
    \ identiﬁed in the ﬁeld of cyber supply chain risk\nmanagement. Firstly, through\
    \ an extensive literature survey and consensus from a group\nof experts’ opinions,\
    \ the challenges affecting BDLT adoption are identiﬁed; secondly,\nan integrated\
    \ “ISM-MICMAC” approach is used to identify the most signiﬁcant of the\nsixteen\
    \ challenges extracted from the literature and discussed with practitioners and\n\
    academics. The proposed methodology consists of two steps: interpretive structural\n\
    modeling (ISM) and cross impact matrix multiplication applied to classiﬁcation\
    \ (MICMAC),\nSustainability 2021, 13, 4672\n13 of 28\nand is described in detail\
    \ in the Sections 4.2 and 5.5. The methodology proposed in this\nresearch is depicted\
    \ and described in Figure 1.\nSustainability 2021, 13, x FOR PEER REVIEW \n15 of 30 \n\

    Sustainability 2021, 13, 4672\n14 of 28\n4.1. Data Collection\nThe ISM methodology\
    \ is built on the consensus from a group of experts’ opinions\nthrough different\
    \ techniques, such as nominal technique, questioner, face-to-face discussion,\n\
    etc., to establish pairwise contextual relationships among variables [189,190].\
    \ With this in\nmind, a questionnaire was designed to collect each experts’ opinions\
    \ on the contextual and\nmutual relationships among the BDLT challenges listed\
    \ in Table 1. The ﬁrst section of the\nquestionnaire contained general information\
    \ about the experts’ proﬁles and the professional\nroles and backgrounds they\
    \ belong to, and the second section examined the contextual\ninteractions between\
    \ the identiﬁed challenges. The experts were requested to give their\nwritten\
    \ opinions individually to avoid the inﬂuence of one opinion on another and were\n\
    then aggregated and analyzed to develop the ﬁnal contextual and mutual relationships\n\
    matrix. The selected group of suitable experts who are conversant in the ﬁeld\
    \ of BDLT\ntechnologies and CSCRM was found to be small. However, the number of\
    \ respondents\nparticipating in the ISM methodology should not be too many [191,192].\
    \ Thus, a total\nnumber of ﬁve experts (two academics and three industrial operators)\
    \ from the ﬁeld of\ncybersecurity and blockchain technology were involved in answering\
    \ the questions by\nidentifying what challenges lead to other challenges during\
    \ the adoption of BDLTs in\nCSCRM. In the present study, two of the participating\
    \ experts have a minimum of ten years\nof academic experience in the university:\
    \ one has about 15 years of research experience\nin supply chain management, supply\
    \ chain risk management, logistics 4.0, Industry 4.0,\nand management of cyber\
    \ risks in supply chains, and the other has researched uncertainty\nanalysis,\
    \ safety and security, sustainability, and innovation for the last 20 years. Both\n\
    professors are authors of over 90 publications at the international and national\
    \ levels.\nThey have combined academic qualiﬁcations with professional experience\
    \ in research\nand consulting projects, and have participated in the implementation\
    \ of several research\nprojects funded by the government and industry. The other\
    \ three experts are supply\nchain executives in different industrial sectors,\
    \ working in positions, such as supply chain\nmanager, operation manager, and\
    \ plant quality manager, in manufacturing industries\nfor 10–15 years. They are\
    \ currently collaborating on several projects concerning the use\nof blockchain\
    \ technology for the automation of transactions and processes, leading to a\n\
    transparent and responsible global supply chain.\n4.2. ISM Methodology\nISM is\
    \ a mathematically derived methodology that was ﬁrst proposed in 1973 by\nProfessor\
    \ Walter Felter. It can analyze a complex system into smaller sub-units with the\n\
    use of experts’ practical experience and knowledge and construct a structural\
    \ multilevel\nmodel [193]. As stated by [194], “ISM is an interactive learning\
    \ process where a set\nof directly and indirectly associated variables are structured\
    \ into a comprehensive and\nsystematic model”. Based on another deﬁnition by [195],\
    \ “ISM is a popular method\nof solving complex decision-making problems and for\
    \ identifying relationships among\nelements or variables”.\nIn the literature,\
    \ ISM has been adopted by some researchers as a methodology to\nsupport blockchain\
    \ adoption in various ﬁelds. Reference [196] proposed a TISM-based\nmethodology\
    \ to develop a hierarchical model for the factors facilitating the success of\n\
    blockchain adoption in the cloud service industry, and to study the mutual interrelation-\n\
    ship among critical success factors. Reference [197] used an integrated ISM-DEMATEL\n\
    approach in an Indian agriculture supply chain (ASC) to model the signiﬁcant challenges\n\
    for blockchain implementation. Reference [173] deployed ISM methodology to analyze\
    \ the\ntechnological, organizational, and environmental factors/elements inﬂuencing\
    \ blockchain\nadoption in the supply chain. Reference [63] applied a combined\
    \ Fuzzy-ANP and Fuzzy-\nISM approach to identify blockchain enablers in a sustainable\
    \ supply chain.\nIn this paper, the ISM was applied to envision the contextual\
    \ relationship among\nidentiﬁed challenges for BDLT adoption in a cyber-secure\
    \ supply chain and cluster them\nSustainability 2021, 13, 4672\n15 of 28\naccording\
    \ to their driver and dependence power. The following steps of the ISM process\n\
    have been adopted in detail, contributing to developing the diagraph and ﬁnal\
    \ ISM model.\n5. Results\n5.1. Structural Self-Interaction Matrix (SSIM)\nFor\
    \ developing a contextual relationship, the connection between a pair of challenges\n\
    and the associated path of the relation is questioned to analyze the variables,\
    \ and the\ncontextual relationship among the identiﬁed challenges are hypothesized\
    \ based on the\nconcept of one challenge leads to another challenge. In this way,\
    \ the experts were asked\nto complete pairwise contextual relationships between\
    \ challenges using four alphabetical\ncodes in a 16 * 16 SSIM. Keeping this in\
    \ mind, the following symbols (V, A, X, O) have been\nused to denote the direction\
    \ of relationships between challenges (i and j):\nV: Challenges i enable/impact\
    \ on challenges j.\nA: Challenges j enable/impact on challenges i.\nX: Challenges\
    \ i and j are mutually interdependent (i.e., either will enable or inﬂuence\n\
    the other).\nO: No relationship between challenges i and j.\nA ﬁnal “Structural\

    5.2. Reachability Matrix\nAn “Initial reachability matrix (IRM)” is developed\
    \ by converting the symbols “V, A,\nX, O” into binary elements (i.e., 1, 0) to\
    \ get IRM. To construct an initial reachability matrix,\nshown in Table 3, some\
    \ rules are adopted as follows:\ni.\nIf the symbol of V is shown in the cell of\
    \ (i, j) in the SSIM matrix, then in the IRM, the\nvalue of cell (i, j) will become\
    \ 1, and the corresponding cell (j, i) is replaced with the\nvalue ‘0’.\nii.\n\
    If the symbol of A is shown in the cell of (i, j) in the SSIM matrix, then in\
    \ the IRM, the\nvalue of cell (i, j) will become 0, and the corresponding cell\
    \ (j, i) is replaced with the\nvalue ‘1’.\nSustainability 2021, 13, 4672\n16 of\
    \ 28\niii.\nIf the symbol of X is shown in the cell of (i, j) in the SSIM matrix,\
    \ then in the IRM, the\nvalue of cell (i, j) will become 1, and the corresponding\
    \ cell (j, i) is replaced with the\nvalue ‘1’.\niv.\nIf the symbol of O is shown\
    \ in the cell of (i, j) in the SSIM matrix, then in the IRM, the\nvalue of cell\
    \ (i, j) will become 0, and the corresponding cell (j, i) is replaced with the\n\
    value ‘0’.\nSubsequently, the “Final reachability matrix (FRM)” is achieved by\
    \ incorporating\ntransitivity rules in the IRM. The transitivity rules suggest\
    \ that if factor X affects factor Y\nand factor Y affects factor Z, then factor\
    \ X automatically affects factor Z. The FRM is shown\nin Table 4. The transitive\
    \ links are highlighted using a yellow shade.\nTable 3. Initial reachability matrix\

    \ matrix obtained is then divided into different levels of partition\nto construct\
    \ the hierarchy graph. Three sets for each challenge are processed, namely\n“reachability\
    \ set, antecedent set, and intersection set”. The reachability set of each challenge\n\
    comprises itself as well as the other challenges that it may drive and can be\
    \ found as the\nset of elements that contain 1 in that particular row. Similarly,\
    \ the antecedent set includes\nthe challenge itself and the other challenge that\
    \ may support in achieving it, and is the set\nof elements that contain 1 in that\
    \ particular column. The challenges that are considered at\nSustainability 2021,\
    \ 13, 4672\n17 of 28\nlevel 1 or the top level in the ISM model are removed from\
    \ the table for the next iteration set\nwhen both the reachability set and the\
    \ intersection set are similar. This process of assigning\nthe level of each challenge\
    \ continues up to the deﬁning of the last challenge. Table 5 shows\nthe details\

    \ for Theory\nThe primary objective of this paper is to identify and rank the\
    \ challenges affecting\nBDLT adoption in CSCRM and to unravel the causal relationships\
    \ between them. From\na theoretical point of view, the contribution of this paper\
    \ is four-fold. First, this research\nadopted a comprehensive literature review\
    \ and the opinion of experts with knowledge of\nblockchain to extract challenges\
    \ of blockchain adoption in the CSCRM context. Second,\nthis is one of the ﬁrst\
    \ studies of its type focusing on the challenges of BDLT adoption\nin CSCRM, modeling\
    \ them using an ISM methodology in the structure of a hierarchical\nframework\
    \ to envision the contextual relationships among the identiﬁed challenges. Third,\n\
    using the MICMAC diagram, the inﬂuential challenges were clustered according to\
    \ their\ndriving and dependence powers. This research is expected to contribute\
    \ to enabling\nresearchers to propose and test theoretical models and different\
    \ hypotheses based on the\ncritical determinants of blockchain adoption in different\
    \ supply chain contexts. Finally,\nthe developed framework with the priority of\
    \ the sixteen inﬂuencing challenges helps\nSustainability 2021, 13, 4672\n20 of\
    \ 28\nresearchers and practitioners to get insights into a long-term capacity\
    \ towards BDLTs\nadoption to achieve cybersecurity at a supply chain level.\n\
    6.2. Implications for Practice\nThe emergence of the imbalance towards the practical\
    \ side of CSCRM in the real-\nworld leads to a signiﬁcant incentive for organizations\
    \ to look at BDLTs from a cyber\nsecure supply chain perspective, given the negative\
    \ effects of cyber events that affect\nsupply chain operations. For example, concerns\
    \ include a lack of conﬁdentiality during\ninformation sharing while maintaining\
    \ data visibility and transparency between supply\nchain partners. Therefore,\
    \ managers and employees are those who need to reach outside\ntheir “silo” activities\
    \ and adopt a holistic view of cyber risks, as well as innovative solutions\n\
    to deal with these risks. The most vital link problem from a cyber perspective\
    \ in the supply\nchain could be identiﬁed via technologies, such as blockchain\
    \ for leveraging the CSCRM\nprocess. However, the adoption of BDLTs comes with\
    \ several challenges, including a lack\nof technology maturity, users’ credential\
    \ loss (e.g., wallet), and in some scenarios, being\nsubject to cryptocurrency\
    \ volatility; so, attention to them constitutes the main objective of\nthis paper.\n\
    In this vein, the current study offers meaningful contributions for practitioners,\
    \ con-\nsulting companies, and leading enterprises to be aware of the criticality\
    \ and interplay of\ndifferent inﬂuencing challenges and inter-relationships among\
    \ them while implementing\nBDLTs in the CSCRM.\nIn this study, MICMAC analysis\
    \ has been adopted to help the analysis of the driving\nand dependence powers\
    \ of the challenges and their classiﬁcation into four different clusters.\nThe\
    \ identiﬁed challenges in the “Drivers” cluster should be considered to guarantee\
    \ the\nlong-term success of BDLT-based cybersecurity in the industries since this\
    \ is the early stage\nof development for BDLT technologies. These challenges are\
    \ a pre-requisite to obtaining\nother challenges, which are the topmost reasons\
    \ for an organization to make a decision for\nBDLT adoption and are reﬂected under\
    \ the “dependent cluster” (cryptocurrency volatility).\nIn this context, it is\
    \ worth noting that the challenges in the “dependent cluster” are impor-\ntant\
    \ because they need all the other challenges to reduce the impact of these challenges\n\
    during the adoption of blockchain. However, a lot of focus on these challenges\
    \ with high\ndependence and less driving power without considering a strong set\
    \ of “driver” challenges\nwill not be useful to manage the adoption of blockchain\
    \ in CSCRM.\nTherefore, for the sustained success of BDLT in CSCRM activities,\
    \ decision-makers\nshould also be aware of “driver” challenges (such as technology\
    \ immaturity, poor clarity\nregulatory provisions, dependent on input information\
    \ from external oracles, scalabil-\nity and bandwidth issues, and smart contract\
    \ issues). This enables them to have more\nincentives for transiting into the\
    \ digital operation phase.\n7. Conclusions, Discussion of Findings, and Scope\
    \ for Future Research\nThe adoption of BDLTs in the cyber secure supply chain\
    \ is in its nascent stage, and\nthere are numerous challenges that must be overcome\
    \ before these innovative technologies\nproceed to the next phase. BDLTs have\
    \ enormous potential to enhance the cybersecurity of\na supply chain if the issues\
    \ to its adoption are reinforced with favorable regulations and\nmethods. To achieve\
    \ this objective, this research conducted an analytical hierarchy “ISM-\nbased\
    \ model” approach to analyze the interactions among the identiﬁed BDLT challenges\n\
    and to partition the challenges into levels based on their driving and dependency\
    \ powers.\nIn line with the previous literature, sixteen key BDLT challenges of\
    \ CSCRM were identiﬁed\nand validated with a group of experts in academics and\
    \ in the industries. Furthermore, our\nﬁndings classiﬁed each challenge into one\
    \ of four different kinds of power.\nThe ﬁndings from the study suggest that the\
    \ challenges “technology immaturity”,\n“poor clarity regulatory provisions”, “dependent\
    \ on input information from external ora-\ncles”, “scalability and bandwidth issues”,\
    \ and “smart contract issues” with high driving\nand low dependence powers are\
    \ the major challenges for adoption of blockchain in CSCRM\nSustainability 2021,\
    \ 13, 4672\n21 of 28\nand are placed at the bottom of the ISM model. The challenges\
    \ “throughput and low per-\nformance”, “lack of standardization and interoperability”,\
    \ “privacy and information disclo-\nsure issues”, “criminal activity and malicious\
    \ attacks”, “poor user experience”, “suitability\nof blockchain”, “lack of trust\
    \ in new technology suppliers”, “quantum resilience”, “wasted\nresources or high\
    \ energy consumption” and “users’ credential loss” imply both strong\npowers;\
    \ they play a key function in the tendency to adopt blockchain in CSCRM, and they\n\
    need more attention. The challenge “cryptocurrency volatility” with high dependence\
    \ and\nlow driving power is located at the top of the ISM framework. No factor\
    \ is identiﬁed as\nan autonomous factor, indicating that all the selected challenges\
    \ should be paid attention\nto by policymakers. Given that BDLT adoption for cyber\
    \ supply chain risk management\nis in its infancy, there are still a number of\
    \ challenges behind the 16 barriers identiﬁed in\nthis paper, which must be explored\
    \ for their structural relationships that can be used to\ndevelop plans to overcome\
    \ obstacles in the implementation of a BDLT-based cyber secure\nsupply chain.\
    \ Therefore, similar type of research can also be recommended in the future\n\
    to eradicate any important obstacle that might have been affected in BDLTs’ adoption\n\
    in CSCRM. Despite the signiﬁcance of the study, the current study was not without\
    \ its\nlimitations, one of which are the interdependencies among the selected\
    \ challenges, which\nwere developed based on judgments from academics and practitioners,\
    \ which can be\nincluded the chosen experts’ personal biases. To refuse the aforementioned\
    \ problems in\nthe outcomes of the study, further empirical studies could be conducted\
    \ to quantity the\neffects of the explored challenges on blockchain adoption in\
    \ the CSCRM and also examine\nthe intensity of the causal relationship between\
    \ them. Additionally, the use of empirical\nresearches is recommended, such as\
    \ conﬁrmatory factor analysis (CFA) and structural\nequation modeling (SEM), to\
    \ test and validate this proposed ISM-based model.\nAuthor Contributions: N.E.,\

    \ technol-\nogy dramatically increases the ability of the organization to\nacquire\
    \ a vast array of data about the location and properties\nof any entity that can\
    \ be physically tagged and wirelessly\nscanned within certain technical limitations.\
    \ RFID can be\napplied to a variety of tasks, structures, work systems and\ncontexts\

    \ research questions related to how RFID technology:\n(1) is developed, adopted,\
    \ and implemented by organiza-\ntions; (2) is used, supported, and evolved within\
    \ organiza-\ntions and alliances; and (3) impacts individuals, business\nprocesses,\

    \ technical problems asso-\nciated with implementing and using RFID are addressed\n\

    \ information systems (IS) to\nacquire, interpret, retain, and distribute information\
    \ [86].\nInnovations in information technology (IT) continue to\nimprove the cost-performance\
    \ capabilities of organizations\nto perform these four basic IS tasks. For example,\
    \ the In-\nternet has dramatically altered the capability of the ﬁrm to\nacquire\
    \ external data and distribute it throughout and be-\nyond the organization. Intelligent\
    \ agents and knowledge\nmanagement systems allow managers to interpret data and\n\
    information to create useful managerial knowledge. Tech-\nnical improvements in\
    \ storage media allow ﬁrms to amass\nvast data warehouses, while ever increasing\
    \ processing\npower allows managers to mine their data for useful\ninformation\
    \ about their operations, existing customers, and\npotential markets. Further,\
    \ advances in technology-based\nreal-time information gathering and decision support\
    \ sys-\ntems promote real-time decision making that allow ﬁrms to\nreﬁne operational\
    \ performance.\nOccasionally, a new technology emerges that provides a\nmajor\
    \ shift in the cost-performance capabilities of one of\nthese four basic IS tasks.\

    and\nsystems\ntechnologies\n(MOST), where the ideas in this article were presented\
    \ in\nan earlier form.1 Radio frequency identiﬁcation (RFID) is\none such MOST\
    \ technology that dramatically changes the\ncapabilities of the organization to\
    \ acquire a vast array of\ndata about the location and properties of any entity\
    \ that can\nbe physically tagged and wirelessly scanned within certain\ntechnical\
    \ limitations [42, 161]. RFID technology also\nheralds the emergence of inexpensive\
    \ and highly effective\npervasive computers that will have dramatic impacts on\n\
    individuals, organizations, and society [145]. RFID allows\nany tagged entity\
    \ to become a mobile, intelligent, com-\nmunicating component of the organization’s\
    \ overall infor-\nmation infrastructure. A similar theme of automated\nidentiﬁcation\
    \ systems characterizes the research of the\nAuto-ID Center (now Auto-ID Labs)\
    \ that was conducted in\nthe 2002–2003 time frame with researchers associated\
    \ with\nuniversities and companies around the world ([5, 41, 112,\n121).2 The\
    \ combination of the tagged mobile entity, the\nreader, the hardware infrastructure,\
    \ and the software that\nprocesses the data makes RFID systems a new type of\n\
    interorganizational system (IOS) with the potential to\naffect the entire value\
    \ chain [95]. RFID systems cross ﬁrm\nboundaries, resulting in new opportunities\
    \ to transform the\nsupply chain for real-time optimization [12, 67, 107].\nAs\
    \ the various entities associated with business processes\nbecome increasingly\
    \ mobile in the presence of RFID, the\nability of the organization to monitor\
    \ the location, history,\nand changing states of these tagged entities increases\
    \ the\nlevel of process freedom [101]. This further increases the\nﬂexibility,\
    \ efﬁciency, and subsequent value created by these\nprocesses. Several major buyers\
    \ and retailers have come to\nrecognize the potential usefulness of RFID technology\
    \ as a\nway of tracking physical goods across the supply chain [41].\nThis has\
    \ led some of them to mandate its adoption by their\ntrading partners [17]. The\
    \ accompanying beneﬁts of this\nmandate have accelerated the potential usage of\
    \ RFID,\nalong with a corresponding increase in attention from the\npopular press.\
    \ Nevertheless, in spite of the attention and\npotential of RFID, the capabilities\
    \ of this new technology\nhave also engendered anxiety from certain segments of\n\
    society, where concerns about personal privacy are signif-\nicant [13, 122, 144].\
    \ Consequently, there is a new interest\nby academic researchers to engage in\
    \ scholarly investiga-\ntion regarding the adoption, usage, and impact of this\n\
    technology on individuals, organizations, supply chains,\nand markets [12]. This\
    \ interest is also international in its\nscope (e.g., based on research at Keio\
    \ University in Japan\nby Ogawa et al. [121], and at Fudan University in China\
    \ by\nMin et al. [114], and elsewhere).\nAlthough it represents a speciﬁc instance\
    \ of IT, RFID is\nquite generic in terms of its MOST capabilities. Speciﬁ-\ncally,\
    \ these are: (1) the capability to capture information in\nsettings that involve\
    \ mobility of some types of business\nobjects (e.g., products, pallets, people,\
    \ vehicles, etc.); (2)\nthe opportunity to use this kind of information collection\n\
    capability to span across a variety of organizational\nenvironments and business\
    \ processes that exist internal to\nand across operations, business units, organizations\
    \ and\nmarkets; (3) the facility to interface and bring together the\nfunctionality\
    \ of key systems whose information endowments\nwill be dramatically increased,\
    \ thereby increasing infor-\nmation available to managers; and (4) the capability\
    \ of\ninnovative emerging technologies that will change our\nperceptions of the\
    \ meaning and constraints associated with\nlocation, space and time. The difference\
    \ between RFID\ntechnology and other past technologies such as electronic\ndata\
    \ interchange (EDI), software agents, and the Internet\ncomes with the ‘‘sensing’’\
    \ capabilities that RFID offers in\nan increasingly dynamic, mobile physical world.\
    \ EDI has\nbeen helpful in supply chain operations, but was mostly\nimplemented\
    \ to effect operations control via standardized\ndocuments and transaction sets\
    \ in interorganizational\ninformation exchange. In a similar ﬂexible manner, soft-\n\
    ware agents have the capacity to collect data over time, but\nunlike RFID tags\
    \ they cannot stand alone to interact with\ntheir environment upon demand. While\
    \ the Internet has\nbecome ubiquitous, its functionality is largely limited to\n\
    the software and information retrieval capabilities within\nits reach. When linked\
    \ with an internal infrastructure,\nRFID technology is able to provide automated\
    \ ubiquitous\nmonitoring of mobile activities inside and outside the ﬁrm\nenabling\
    \ unprecedented control for greater efﬁciency and\nreal-time decision making for\
    \ better effectiveness.\n1 For additional information on the positioning of this\
    \ research, the\ninterested reader should refer to the recent survey on IS research\
    \ in\nManagement Science by Banker and Kauffman [21], and on eco-\nnomics and\
    \ electronic commerce in the International Journal of\nElectronic Commerce by\
    \ Kauffman and Walden [100]. Based on the\nconceptualization of directions for\
    \ research in these works, RFID-\nrelated research ﬁts well with some of the other\
    \ primary themes that\nhave been studied in the past 10 years. These include interorganiza-\n\
    tional information systems, technology impacts and business value,\nownership\
    \ and information sharing problems, decision support and\ndecision making, organizational\
    \ and strategic transformation, tech-\nnology demand and supply, and systems integration\
    \ with Web-based\nsystems and other infrastructural systems within the ﬁrm.\n\
    2 The Auto-ID Center Web site (http://www.autoid.org) reports that\nMIT’s Auto-ID\
    \ Center closed in October 2003, and transferred its\ntechnology to EPCglobal\
    \ (http://www.epcglobalinc.org), which is\nhandling the related development of\
    \ EPC standards. Seven universi-\nties now participate in a follow-on research\
    \ consortium, including\nKeio University (Japan), Information and Communication\
    \ University\n(Korea), St. Gallen University (Switzerland), University of Adelaide\n\
    (Australia), Cambridge University (United Kingdom) and Fudan\nUniversity (China).\
    \ There were more than 100 companies involved at\nthe height of the Auto-ID Center’s\
    \ global activities, including IBM,\nCap Gemini/Ernst and Young, and Accenture,\
    \ which contributed to\nthe Center’s white paper series.\n88\nInf Technol Manage\
    \ (2007) 8:87–110\n123\nThe potential impacts of RFID are likely to be of interest\n\
    to researchers across a number of ﬁelds [161]. They include\nmechanical and electrical\
    \ engineering [72], systems and\nsoftware engineering [92], health management\
    \ [151],\npharmaceuticals [103, 152], marketing and customer rela-\ntionship management\
    \ [51], public transportation [25], ethics\n[118], and legal and public policy\
    \ [61]. Among these,\nmarketing and supply chain researchers and professionals\n\
    should be particularly interested in the coming transforma-\ntions [9]. Through\
    \ the application of RFID-powered supply\nchain management information systems,\
    \ organizations will\nbe increasingly able to make the adjustments in their pro-\n\
    cesses necessary to achieve a ‘‘triple A supply chain’’ for\nimproved agility,\
    \ adaptability and alignment as pointed out\nby Lee [106]. This theme also is\
    \ present in the earlier work\nof researchers from IBM’s T. J. Watson Research\
    \ Center\nassociated with MIT’s Auto-ID Center for RFID-related\nresearch [3].\
    \ RFID-based environmental sensing in a tem-\nporally complex, mobile, organizational\
    \ and interorganiza-\ntional systems world will permit supply chain operations\
    \ to\nbe more effectively coupled with marketing, accounting and\nﬁnance-related\
    \ processes, and thereby permit increasing\nlevels of business process outsourcing.\n\
    As the technical problems associated with implementing\nand using RFID technology\
    \ are addressed and solved, the\nmanagerial and organizational issues will emerge\
    \ as critical\nareas for IS research. A research agenda that addresses a\nvariety\
    \ of questions related to RFID that closely corresponds\nto the nomological net\
    \ deﬁned by Benbasat and Zmud [28]\nseems appropriate at this time. IT applications\
    \ create\nopportunities to support new tasks. It also may support tasks\nthat\
    \ exist within a given structural setting. For example,\nRFID (as an IT artifact)\
    \ provides the opportunity to redesign\ntraditional warehouse packing and shipping\
    \ activities (the\ntasks) for a business-to-business vendor-managed inventory\n\
    system (the structure), where there is relentless cost cutting\nto combat global\
    \ competition (the context). In this paper, we\npropose a research agenda for\
    \ studying RFID to address\nbroad research questions related to how RFID technology:\n\
    •\nis developed, adopted, and implemented by organiza-\ntions to solve speciﬁc\
    \ problems or create business\nopportunities—the adoption dimension;\n•\nis used\
    \ and supported within processes, organizations\nand alliances—the usage dimension;\
    \ and,\n•\nimpacts individuals, business processes, organizations,\nand markets—the\
    \ impact dimension.\nIn the next section we begin with a brief overview of the\n\
    important technical aspects of RFID. Because RFID can be\napplied to a variety\
    \ of tasks, structures, contexts and work\nsystems [7], we introduce a framework\
    \ in Sect. 3 to cate-\ngorize the tagable entities and the obstacles to value\
    \ asso-\nciated with various tasks within four different structural\nsettings\
    \ of RFID usage along the value chain. By applying\nthe research questions outlined\
    \ above to these several dif-\nferent value chain contexts, we are able to propose\
    \ a series\nof research issues and themes in Sect. 4 to provide a road-\nmap for\
    \ IS researchers to investigate the adoption, usage,\nand impact of RFID. We conclude\
    \ this analysis in Sect. 5 by\nconsidering the broader IS and interdisciplinary\
    \ research\ncontexts related to RFID as a MOST technology.\n2 The technical background\
    \ of RFID\nRFID or radio frequency identiﬁcation is a wireless tracking\ntechnology\
    \ that allows a reader to activate a transponder on a\nradio frequency tag attached\
    \ to, or embedded in, an item,\nallowing the reader to remotely read and/or write\
    \ data to the\nRFID tag ([54, 82, 89, 158]. Passive tags draw power from\nthe\
    \ reader and are cheaper and smaller than active tags,\nwhich have a battery used\
    \ to broadcast the signal to the\nreader [30]. Semi-passive tags use an internal\
    \ battery to\nensure data integrity, however the signal sent from the reader\n\
    generates the power to transmit the signal from the tag. RFID\nis an extension\
    \ of existing bar code technology and is fully\nintegrated with the EPCglobal\
    \ Network (http://www.\nepcglobalinc.org).3 Active tags typically have internal\
    \ read\nand write capability, their own batteries, and can transmit\ntheir signals\
    \ over a longer distance. Depending upon the size\nof the tag and the frequency\
    \ used, the current range of\nreception, or read range, of the reader is limited.4\
    \ Figure 1\nprovides a summary of the most popular tag frequencies.5\n3 The EPCglobal\
    \ Network was developed by the Auto-ID Center at\nMIT as a joint venture between\
    \ EAN International and the Uniform\nCode Council (UCC) to develop, support, and\
    \ promote the global\nadoption of the standardized Electronic Product Code (EPC)\
    \ and\nRFID. The EPC tag itself is made up of a microchip containing the\nEPC\
    \ and an attached antenna.\n4 For example, Hsi and Fait [85] report on an application\
    \ of RFID in a\ntechnologically enhanced science museum exhibit setting in San\n\
    Francisco, California, where the chips that are used emit a 13.56 MHz\nsignal\
    \ with a low-power signal reader that works within only a few\ninches of the tag.\n\
    5 As of late 2005, tags operating at the worldwide-approved 13.56 MHz\nhigh frequency\
    \ (HF) level had a maximum range between the tag and\nreader of about 1 m. At\
    \ that time, pilot tests using the 915 MHz ultra\nhigh frequency (UHF) level had\
    \ a range up to about 60 feet under\ncontrolled conditions. However, tags utilizing\
    \ higher frequencies have\na limited storage capacity and 915 MHz is prohibited\
    \ from being\nincorporated into RFID applications in Europe [37]. In general,\
    \ tags\noperating at low frequencies of around 125 kHz use much less power\nand\
    \ have a limited read range, but are able to penetrate most non-\nmetallic substances,\
    \ including liquid. UHF tags operating in the\n900 MHz range use more power, are\
    \ less expensive, and have signals\nthat are less likely to pass through many\
    \ materials. Due to the com-\nbination of tag size, read range, ability to control\
    \ the read zone through\ndirectional antennas on the reader, potential to drive\
    \ down tag costs,\nand the beneﬁcial read rate, most of the efforts to promote\
    \ RFID at the\nitem or pallet level currently are directed at the UHF 915 MHz\
    \ tags.\nInf Technol Manage (2007) 8:87–110\n89\n123\nIndustry and public interest\
    \ in RFID technology took a\nmajor leap forward in June 2003 when Wal-Mart mandated\n\
    its largest 100 suppliers to begin using RFID tags on\nshipped items at the pallet\
    \ level by January 2005 [22, 137].\nAnalysts predict Wal-Mart could save over\
    \ $8 billion\nannually using RFID by reducing the labor costs of scan-\nning items,\
    \ out-of-stock items and item theft, while making\nimprovements in the supply\
    \ chain [77]. ‘‘[T]heft costs\nWal-Mart an estimated $2 billion a year; a legitimate\n\
    business of that size would rank #694 on the Fortune\n1,000,’’ according to Boyle\
    \ [35]. Clearly, the goal of tag-\nging every item in a store is appealing to\
    \ many retail\nbusinesses.\nOther ﬁrms followed Wal-Mart’s lead in requiring\n\
    suppliers to implement RFID, including the U.S. Depart-\nment of Defense (DoD)\
    \ and Target [17]. The mandates lack\nsome credibility due to technical difﬁculties\
    \ and compli-\nance costs, but many trading partners nevertheless worked\nto implement\
    \ some pilot projects using RFID within the\nmandated timeframe.6 Other technologies,\
    \ such as EDI,\nhave had a similar process of buyer-initiated mandates for\nadoption\
    \ [132]. For some initiators, such mandates may be\nsufﬁcient for the buyers to\
    \ obtain sufﬁcient ROI.\nMost informed observers of emerging technologies\nbelieve\
    \ that the cost of RFID tags will drop dramatically\n(e.g., [64, 119]. To be widely\
    \ used, tag costs will need to\ndrop from 506 c each to 56 c each in 5–10 years\
    \ ([3, 139, 142,\n149, 156]. As we initiated our research project on RFID at\n\
    the Carlson School of Management’s MIS Research Center\nat the University of Minnesota\
    \ in 2004, most organizations\nwere focusing on utilizing passive UHF tags that\
    \ have a per\nunit cost of under 506 c when purchased in volumes of a\nmillion\
    \ tags or more. More recently in September 2005,\nRFID Journal reported that ‘‘[t]here\
    \ are signs that one of\nthe biggest hurdles to widespread adoption of passive\
    \ RFID\ntechnology in the supply chain—namely, tag price—is\ndisappearing, or\
    \ at least getting lower’’ [120]. Avery\nDennison RFID, a North Carolina-based\
    \ RFID chipmaker,\nis now shipping second generation EPC inlays (prior to\nembedding\
    \ in labels) for 7:96 c each in quantities of 1 mil-\nlion or more. This is not\
    \ far off the 56 c per tag predicted in\n2001 and 2003 simulations by the Auto-ID\
    \ Center at MIT\n[139, 149]. In most cases, these tags have an effective read\n\
    range of less than 20 feet.\nTo make RFID tags cheaper is easily recognizable\
    \ as a\nchicken-and-egg technology adoption and diffusion game.\nIt will be necessary\
    \ for market demand to dramatically\nincrease, creating additional volume-based\
    \ manufacturing\nresults. However, for the demand to materialize, RFID tags\n\
    will need to be cheaper and more effective than they are\ncurrently. So coordination\
    \ will be required to bring to-\ngether the value and ROI expectations of the\
    \ different\nkinds of players that may be involved in adoption [16].\nThis situation\
    \ suggests that there may be considerable\ninertia that will hold up the move\
    \ to readily available, high\nfunctioning, cheap tags capable of delivering high\
    \ ROI.\n3 RFID applications along the value chain\nThere are many RFID applications\
    \ that can be used across\nthe value chain. To frame our research agenda, we consider\n\
    applications at four different locations or structural settings\nin the value\
    \ chain: B2B logistics, internal operations, B2C\nmarketing, and B2C after-sales\
    \ service. (See Fig. 2)\nIt is useful to broadly consider the potential tagable\n\
    entities associated with business processes or tasks within\neach particular value\
    \ chain position. Tagable entities can\nFig. 1 Most popular RFID read\nrange frequencies\n\

    \ supplier adoption including Target, Best Buy,\nAlbertson’s, Tesco, Metro AG,\
    \ Carrefour and Ahold, among others\n[156].\n90\nInf Technol Manage (2007) 8:87–110\n\
    123\ninclude different types of mobile equipment including\ntools, vehicles or\
    \ movable parts of stationary equipment,\nmanufacturing component parts, ﬁnished\
    \ products that are\ntransported or change states over time, packaging or doc-\n\
    umentation associated with such entities including pallets,\ncrates, or promotional\
    \ materials, and the people involved in\ntransporting or using these entities.\
    \ In addition, as the\ntechnology is in its mass commercialization infancy, there\n\
    are a variety of obstacles to realizing value in the value\nchain. These obstacles\
    \ can be managerial challenges,\norganizational barriers, technical limitations,\
    \ economic\nconstraints, and legal hurdles. Some are under the control\nof the\
    \ organization; others are not.\n3.1 B2B logistics\nMost organizations have inbound\
    \ and outbound logistics\narrangements with external alliance partners, an applica-\n\
    tion area where RFID systems can create unique value [33].\nCustomers receive\
    \ pallets of goods from suppliers in a\nwarehouse or storage facility that must\
    \ be tracked prior to\nreceipt, as they are received through the facility door,\
    \ and\nas they are moved within the warehouse. Buyers receive\nEDI-produced advanced\
    \ shipping notices of goods from the\nsupplier that should match a prearranged\
    \ purchase order.\nWhen the pallet arrives, the internal contents must be\nmatched\
    \ visually or via bar code to ensure the shipment is\nas expected. When the supplier\
    \ labels the outbound pallet\nor individual items with an RFID tag, the contents\
    \ of the\ncontainer can be veriﬁed immediately upon receipt.\nAppropriately placed\
    \ readers also can track movement of\nthe cargo throughout the facility. The operation\
    \ can be\nstreamlined by having forklifts or other transport vehicles\ntagged\
    \ to ensure they are in proper position when they are\nrequired. Also, to support\
    \ real-time process management\nand decision making, vehicle operators can be\
    \ tagged to\nensure they are in position. Furthermore, in the current era\nof\
    \ increased attention to physical and information security,\nports are seeking\
    \ ways to use RFID readers to read cargo\ncontainers coming to and departing from\
    \ the port to ensure\nproper contents.7\nWhen linked to an EDI system, an overall\
    \ work system\nfounded on RFID technology capabilities will be able to\nefﬁciently\
    \ manage incoming and outgoing cargo contain-\ners. For freight transportation\
    \ and logistics, we can view\ntagable items as including transport vehicles, such\
    \ as long\ndistance trucks and railroad cars, as well as short distance\nbins\
    \ riding on conveyor belts and golf cart-sized factory\nvehicles. Similarly, interface\
    \ vehicles that move cargo\nfrom one transport vehicle to another could be tagged\
    \ to\nensure proper positioning according to schedule, thereby\nfurther enhancing\
    \ control in MOST settings. Vehicle\noperators and personnel required to lift\
    \ and maneuver the\ngoods may be tagged using an RFID-based badge. The\ntagged\
    \ entity or object in the transportation business pro-\ncess could include individual\
    \ items, bundled and bulk-\npackaged items, and specialized cargo containers of\
    \ vari-\nous sizes. Since transportation-focused business processes\nare settings\
    \ in which business items and objects are highly\nmobile, RFID is especially well\
    \ suited for the purpose of\ncreating high performance work systems.\nB2B \nLogistics\n\

    \ across\nthe value chain\n7 Transportation, logistics and shipping are among\
    \ the most inter-\nesting and potentially valuable application areas for RFID\
    \ technology.\nWe refer the interested reader to GlobalManufacture.net [73], Lin\n\
    et al. [108], Morgan [115], Stanford [145], Valentine [155], and\nWilliams [162].\
    \ We expect to see empirical and case study research\nthat will reveal the extent\
    \ of the business value created by RFID in\nthis context.\nInf Technol Manage\
    \ (2007) 8:87–110\n91\n123\nThere are barriers to realizing the potential value\
    \ from\napplying RFID technology to these tasks within a B2B\nlogistics structural\
    \ setting, resulting in realized value levels\nthat may be disappointing from\
    \ an investment standpoint\n[43, 55]. Researchers examining IOS usage have learned\n\
    that business process redesign coupled with technology\nimplementation helps to\
    \ maximize beneﬁts e.g., [1, 140].\nSimilarly, updating logistics processes to\
    \ insert automatic\nremote scans of shipped goods may require a reorganiza-\n\
    tion of processes on both ends of the supplier-customer\nlink. Gaining the cooperation\
    \ of external trading partners to\ntag items and pallets prior to shipment is\
    \ an economic\nchallenge since these systems exhibit more risk than\ninternal\
    \ systems [134].\nFurther, full realization of the value of this technology\n\
    requires wide adoption among trading partners that often\nwill require mandates\
    \ or subsidies necessary to encourage\nfull adoption—and suggests that mandated\
    \ adoption is\ngood for large buyers that can force small suppliers to\nadopt.\
    \ Ownership of equipment and data, plus the equitable\ndistribution of technology\
    \ beneﬁts further complicate the\ninterorganizational adoption of the technology.\
    \ Some of the\nkey drivers of the complexity and difﬁculty of technology\nadoption\
    \ under these circumstances involve non-contract-\nible elements of technology\
    \ investment [20]. They include\nthe negotiation of post-investment value sharing\
    \ [78],\nuncertainties associated with the technology becoming a\nrecognized standard\
    \ [98], difﬁculties in the transmission of\ninformation about the business value\
    \ of the technology in\nits structural setting [15, 16], and the coordination\
    \ of\nadoption\ninvolving\ndifferent\nkinds\nof\norganizational\nparticipants\
    \ [14].\nAcross the value chain, ﬁrms must deal with the\neconomic difﬁculties\
    \ of this new technology. Speciﬁc pro-\ncess needs will determine the appropriate\
    \ cost/distance\ntradeoff regarding the radio frequency (RF) employed, line-\n\
    of-site reading requirements, number of readers necessary,\nand tolerance and\
    \ handling of ‘‘off-track’’ items that may\nrequire human intervention. Also,\
    \ RF-unfriendly packaging\nsuch as metals or liquids may require innovative packaging\n\
    to meet or exceed the technical requirements for clear radio\ntransmission. In\
    \ this context, RFID vendors will likely settle\non standards for economical,\
    \ small and lightweight RFID\nreaders that simplify adoption to some extent [130].8\n\
    B2B partnerships can often span international bound-\naries, which make international\
    \ standards agreements\ncritical.\nFor\nexample,\nmost\ncountries\nhave\nadopted\n\
    13.56 MHz for HF RFID systems. However, Europe cur-\nrently utilizes 869 MHz for\
    \ UHF while the United States\nuses 915 MHz. Japan, on the other hand, is in the\
    \ early\nstages of considering opening up UHF frequencies for\nRFID usage, and\
    \ has only recently seen many of its cor-\nporations agree on domestic standards\
    \ for embedding RFID\nin products [141]. But international agreements may be\n\
    several years away.\nFinally, potential infringement of labor privacy rights\n\
    and violation of labor union agreements may exist at all\nphases of the value\
    \ chain [70]. Tagging personnel or\nequipment operated by personnel may be seen\
    \ as excessive\noversight that may result in organizational challenges to\nuse\
    \ of the technology. Indeed, many observers of the\ndevelopment of RFID technologies\
    \ fear that this is another\nstep in the direction of a ‘‘surveillance society,’’\
    \ even\nthough this may be more a matter of perceptions than\nreality [76, 113,\
    \ 144].\n3.2 Internal operations\nWithin the manufacturing factory, RFID can be\
    \ used to\ncoordinate the ﬂow and handling of multiple raw materials\nto the point\
    \ of assembly to ensure a smooth process with no\nwaiting for materials. Other\
    \ efﬁciency beneﬁts can be\ngained by tracking manufacturing equipment usage that\n\
    leads to smooth inventory replenishment, improved work-\nﬂows and the elimination\
    \ of manufacturing bottlenecks due\nto materials handling delays [66]. For example,\
    \ Fleisch and\nTellkamp [60] point out that physical inventory and sys-\ntems-based\
    \ information about physical inventory often do\nnot match. Prior to RFID systems,\
    \ most companies only\nhad two opportunities to get them aligned: when periodic\n\
    physical inventory counts are taken by staff, and when a\ncustomer order can not\
    \ be ﬁlled due to a stockout. Also,\nvehicles being assembled in an auto manufacturing\
    \ plant\ncan be tracked as they move through a series of assembly\nprocesses at\
    \ different stations in the plant. The tag will tell\nthe reader the speciﬁc operation\
    \ that needs to be done at\neach station, resulting in much more intelligent factories\n\
    and warehouses [40].\nSeveral airlines use RFID to track bags routed through\n\
    the air transport system to improve security and reduce lost\nbags. Delta Airlines,\
    \ for example, handles 70 million pie-\nces of luggage each year. Senior management\
    \ believes\nthere will be a signiﬁcant return on investment from RFID\nsince the\
    \ airline currently spends tens of millions of dollars\nlocating 800,000 misdirected\
    \ bags each year [36]. In\naddition, food manufacturing and distribution companies,\n\
    and supermarket chains have the opportunity to leverage\n8 During our RFID project,\
    \ we spoke with a number of individuals in\nthe industry including several who\
    \ attended a standards committee\nmeeting on small RFID reader devices in Minneapolis,\
    \ MN. In an\ninterview that took place in February 2005, a senior manager from\
    \ the\nRFID consulting ﬁrm, Reva Systems, offered a positive assessment of\nthe\
    \ likelihood that some of the critical RFID standards issues will be\nsorted out\
    \ and the current efforts of the related national standards\nbody with respect\
    \ to the characteristics and underlying functionality\nof small RFID readers.\n\
    92\nInf Technol Manage (2007) 8:87–110\n123\nthe capabilities of RFID [127]. Sensor-equipped\
    \ tags can\nmonitor the environment surrounding perishable items and\nmaintain\
    \ a history of environmental changes [129]. This is\nespecially relevant in the\
    \ food industry, where shrink—the\nloss of inventory items through theft, misplacement\
    \ and\nmistaken\nidentiﬁcation\nfor\nsale—causes\nunnecessary\noperational costs\
    \ [5, 6]. For example, tagged meat being\ntransported from a packing facility\
    \ or ﬂowing through a\ndistribution center can be monitored for temperature\n\
    readings to detect potential spoilage conditions and ensure\nfood safety. When\
    \ spoilage does occur, having the infor-\nmation available supplied by the tags\
    \ can minimize the\namount of meat that must be discarded and protect con-\nsumers\
    \ by accurately pinpointing the precise portions of a\nshipment that were subject\
    \ to spoilage [62, 126]. Other\napplications of RFID permit checking for product\
    \ obso-\nlescence [5].\nOrganizations can tag expensive pieces of equipment\n\
    such as PCs, laptops, and tablet computers to maintain an\ninventory system for\
    \ movable assets [104]. This reduces\nthe time required to conduct asset inventory\
    \ checks\nallowing them to be done more often or in real-time. It also\nsets the\
    \ stage for real-time decision support and business\nprocess value enhancement,\
    \ as discussed by Gozycki and\nJohnson [74] in the case of Woolworth Inc.’s rollout\
    \ of\nRFID to improve inventory management. Other research\nhas suggested the\
    \ potentially high business value and\nrichness in application of RFID in inventory\
    \ replenishment\nat the store shelf level, based on the new and different\noperational\
    \ policies that it makes possible [163]. The sys-\ntem can also track maintenance\
    \ activity for these assets.\nLarge hospitals now are currently rolling out RFID\
    \ tech-\nnology to keep track of expensive medical equipment to be\nsure the item\
    \ is in the right place at the right time [24]. The\nsavings of avoiding lost\
    \ or stolen medical equipment, as\nwell as reducing periodic costs for leased\
    \ technical\nequipment, are substantial. Similarly, tags can be used to\ntrack\
    \ the historical movement of hospital patients to limit\ncontact in highly contagious\
    \ disease settings [157]. Orga-\nnizations also can use RFID to keep track of\
    \ easily mis-\nplaced items. Libraries are using RFID tags to eliminate\nlost\
    \ books and speed checkout [71]. Ofﬁces that must\nmaintain physical documents\
    \ also can tag binders and\nfolders to locate them faster.\nBeing able to track\
    \ the location of employees can boost\nhuman resources management. At a major\
    \ motor scooter\nassembly plant in India, buses loaded with workers wearing\n\
    RFID-enabled employee badges are scanned as they pass\nthrough the gates prior\
    \ to the commencement of the next\nwork shift. As the bus pulls up to the assembly\
    \ plant, human\nresource management software calculates the efﬁcient use\nof those\
    \ employees based on their skill levels and the\ntasks requirements for the upcoming\
    \ shift. As employees\ndisembark from the buses, they are immediately assigned\n\
    workstations and their assignments for the next eight hours\nare mapped into a\
    \ larger workforce-planning model for the\neffective operation of the plant. In\
    \ a similar manner, prison\nfacilities are now using RFID-tagged wristbands to\
    \ monitor\nand control the location of prisoners [29, 136].\nIn addition to many\
    \ of the barriers to value identiﬁed for\nB2B logistics, realizing the full potential\
    \ of this technology\nwithin the organization’s internal operations will require\n\
    costly integration with existing enterprise systems appli-\ncations and likely\
    \ business process redesign [12, 131].\nOther major economic expenses include\
    \ installing the\nappropriate number and placement of readers [59] within\nthe\
    \ organization’s facility, as well as proper placement to\navoid reader interference\
    \ from other electro-magnetic\nradiation [90, 147]. Optimizing the appropriate\
    \ placement\nof the RFID components is needed to create the appropriate\nkind\
    \ of interactive environment in which RFID-related\ninformation can express its\
    \ value [125].9\n3.3 B2C marketing and sales\nThe opportunities to use RFID technology\
    \ combined with\npersonalization technology for B2C marketing and sales\nare compelling\
    \ and problematic. Retailers that offer fre-\nquent customer perks cards must\
    \ consider the implications\nof tagging the cards so that customers can be identiﬁed\n\
    when the customer enters the store. Being able to track that\na customer spent\
    \ 10 min in Aisle 6 before moving on to\nspend 15 min in Aisle 4 creates new marketing\
    \ opportu-\nnities. Fusaro [65] demonstrates the potential interest of\nclothing\
    \ retailers to tag products that will be sold and worn\nby customers.\nStore shelf\
    \ demos can transmit information to the cen-\ntralized information system about\
    \ changes in their state due\nto usage by potential customers. Sophistication\
    \ of use and\nskill level by potential customers, length of usage of the\ndemo,\
    \ and depth of use of demo functionality can all be\nused to generate a personalized\
    \ sales promotion to the\npotential customer. Further, by tagging promotional\
    \ mate-\nrials, readers can note that a particular customer removed a\nspeciﬁc\
    \ product ﬂyer from the rack and can activate fol-\nlow-up marketing at a later\
    \ time. In these scenarios, tagable\nentities include individual retail items,\
    \ in-store demos,\npromotional material, customers, sales personnel, item\nhandlers,\
    \ and transport vehicles.\n9 Some observers have written that the limit of process\
    \ interactivity\noccurs beyond the range of sensing of objects, with the sensing\
    \ of\nhuman activity and purposeful motion [143]. Such research is sug-\ngestive\
    \ of the extent to which future applications of RFID are likely to\nemerge that\
    \ involve creating audit trails for human activities in\nbusiness processes (e.g.,\
    \ quality checking and process or transaction\nmonitoring, standard safety checks,\
    \ and so on).\nInf Technol Manage (2007) 8:87–110\n93\n123\nIn addition to the\
    \ barriers to value creation that we\nidentiﬁed previously, retailers must secure\
    \ customer pri-\nvacy. If there is a perception of possible violation of pri-\n\
    vacy, potential customer sabotage of the system must be\nconsidered. Highly personalized\
    \ activities of this type are\nsure to result in a ﬂood of data that will require\
    \ marketers\nto employ powerful data mining capabilities [138]. One of\nthe most\
    \ interesting potential applications comes in support\nof selling with money itself—with\
    \ RFID-enhanced bank-\nnotes, as proposed by Juels and Pappu [94]. The idea is\
    \ to\nwork towards reducing fraud and counterfeiting, but even\nthis application\
    \ has been subject to criticism and concerns\nthat the devices which are used\
    \ to read identiﬁcation\ninformation embedded in banknotes could lead to the\n\
    unexpected tracing of the people who have legally used\nthem in their transactions,\
    \ as Avoine [13] has pointed out,\ncreating consumer concerns at the point of\
    \ sale.\n3.4 B2B services\nFinally, post-purchase service opportunities present\
    \ addi-\ntional issues related to balancing customer service and\nprivacy. When\
    \ making physical service calls on items\npurchased at an earlier date, maintenance\
    \ personnel can\nsave considerable time by scanning live tags on the goods\nto\
    \ determine date of purchase, warranty status, potential\nabusive use, and problem\
    \ diagnostic details. These oppor-\ntunities for improved service generate considerable\
    \ anxiety\nas individuals worry that mobile units may scan peoples’\nhomes from\
    \ the neighborhood streets to determine what\nitems are inside their homes. Consumer\
    \ groups are pressing\nfor legislation to ensure that tags are appropriately deac-\n\
    tivated at the time of sale to ensure that ﬁrms are not\ntracking the use of after-sale\
    \ items or tracking the move-\nments of people with live tags still on their person\
    \ [52].\nWhile the capability to read tags from a distance is quite\nlimited,\
    \ continued improvements in the technology will\nfurther complicate the legal\
    \ questions [65].\n4 Research issues regarding RFID in business settings\nIn accordance\
    \ with our framework in Fig. 2, we now\nhighlight a series of research issues\
    \ and questions centered\non our three broad research themes of the adoption,\
    \ usage\nand impact of RFID.\n4.1 Developing, adopting and implementing RFID\n\
    within organizations\nRFID technology is constantly improving. Even so, there\n\
    are currently many limitations related to the ability of the\nsignal to pass through\
    \ certain materials including human\nand animal tissue, liquids, various metals,\
    \ and other types\nof packaging materials [12]. The ability to read the signal\n\
    at certain distances is related to the size of the antenna on\nthe transmitting\
    \ tag and, therefore, the size and cost of the\ntag itself, the frequency being\
    \ used, and the material the\nsignal must pass through. Further, getting an accurate\n\
    reading of the signal may be hampered by the close\nproximity of other tags potentially\
    \ limiting the number of\ndifferent items that can be in the same container or\
    \ that can\nbe read at the same time. This is the reader collision\nproblem, as\
    \ deﬁned and discussed by Engels [59, pp. 1 and\n5], which involves allocating\
    \ frequencies over time to\nRFID tag readers such that their interference with\
    \ one\nanother is limited. The problem is similar to what is\nobserved with cell\
    \ phones and other more sophisticated\nwireless devices, which have the capacity\
    \ to recognize the\nappropriate base stations. However, affordable RFID tags\n\
    cannot make such distinctions due to their relative lack of\nsophistication. In\
    \ addition, the value of tagging mobile\nitems may be diminished if there is a\
    \ limit to the speed with\nwhich the item must pass the reader in order to be\
    \ read\naccurately. While many technical issues are beyond the\nscope of our business\
    \ and management-oriented research\nagenda, understanding the limitations and\
    \ capabilities tra-\njectory over time is critical for the appropriate rollout\
    \ of\nthis technology and achieving the business value antici-\npated by adopters\
    \ [150].10\nThe development of standards for RFID is critical for\nrapid, widespread\
    \ diffusion of the technology. Fortunately,\nvendors and users are beginning to\
    \ cooperate with one\nanother and standards development organizations (SDOs)\n\
    to evolve RFID standards to ensure adoption [58]. With the\nlimited bandwidth\
    \ currently available to reserve for this\ntechnology, different countries are\
    \ vying to promote their\npre-existing RFID frequencies. International cooperation\
    \ of\nstandards development will be critical to promote uniform\nglobal usage.11\
    \ An example of such cooperation is reported\nby Kivikoski [102], who showcases\
    \ efforts underway to\ndevelop RFID standards for the auto industry via the Auto-\n\
    ID Academic Alliance. This effort has now been moved\nover to industry entirely.\
    \ Riggins and Slaughter [135]\nexamine the role of shared mental models in arriving\
    \ at\n10 The interested reader should also see Hawkes [80], who coined the\nterm\
    \ tag pollution to refer to situations where different kinds of\nsignals picked\
    \ up from ‘‘cuckoo’’ and ‘‘stranger’’ transponders end\nup creating RFID ‘‘noise.’’\
    \ Another useful reference for additional\ntechnical background is Foster and\
    \ Burberry [63].\n11 A useful reference on RFID standards issues can be found\
    \ at http://\nwww.rﬁda.com/apps/standard.htm. The references cover a range of\n\
    industry groups and standards including the Automotive Industry\nAction Group,\
    \ the Unites States Department of Defense, Wal-Mart,\nEPCglobal, Intermec, and\
    \ the International Standards Organization,\nas well as the proprietary technology\
    \ interests of Texas Instruments,\nSony, and Phillips.\n94\nInf Technol Manage\
    \ (2007) 8:87–110\n123\nconsensus in standards choices, with particular attention\n\
    paid to the RFID context.\nRFID will create additional challenges regarding the\n\
    readiness and capabilities of suppliers in supplier-customer\nrelationships as\
    \ evidenced by Wal-Mart’s attempts to\nmandate adoption [148]. Adoption of RFID\
    \ on the sup-\npliers’ side involves placing RFID tags on pallets and\ninstalling\
    \ RFID tag readers in appropriate places to identify\ninventory levels and the\
    \ movement of supplies. It also\ninvolves integrating information ﬂows between\
    \ buyers and\nsuppliers, some of which are likely to be real-time infor-\nmation\n\
    ﬂows.\nIt\nis\nwidely\nknown,\nhowever,\nthat\nWal-Mart’s RFID initiative was\
    \ undertaken while EPC-\nglobal was still ﬁnalizing details of its second generation\n\
    standard to create better performance for read/write capa-\nbilities and transmission.\
    \ This mandate brought into\nquestion the hardware and software technologies that\n\
    needed to be adopted, in the absence of dominant stan-\ndards. EPCglobal was pushing\
    \ for the acceptance of a\nsingle global standard. Although this may have seemed\n\
    unrealistic to some industry observers, others ought to have\nrecognized the extent\
    \ to which common and well-accepted\nstandards relieve uncertainties associated\
    \ with technology\nsolution adoption and spending. We have seen elsewhere\nwith\
    \ global diffusion of digital wireless telephony that the\npresence of a uniﬁed\
    \ standard tends to lead to more rapid\nadoption and higher assessments of value\
    \ in the market-\nplace precisely because they diminish adopter uncertainty\n\
    [99].\nAn interesting issue related to standards development is\nthe role of network\
    \ externalities—more speciﬁcally, indi-\nrect network externalities—in the pricing\
    \ of complemen-\ntary goods [57]. If the same vendor supplies both readers\nand\
    \ tags, then the vendor may price one of the goods\nartiﬁcially low to increase\
    \ demand in the other good. Video\ngame manufacturers know that by pricing platform\
    \ devices\nartiﬁcially low, they can make up the difference with\nhigher-priced\
    \ games, especially when they have near\nmonopoly power in the market. What is\
    \ important is\nwhether games can be played on multiple platforms. For\nRFID,\
    \ will tags be readable using readers from multiple\nvendors or from a proprietary\
    \ seller?\nThe maturation of the technology, the role of the SDO,\nand the strategies\
    \ of technology vendors all impact the cost\nand speed of diffusion, which inﬂuences\
    \ the way managers\ndevelop the business case for RFID. In addition to indirect\n\
    externalities, managers must also consider direct exter-\nnalities, which can\
    \ be either positive or negative, depend-\ning upon whether the users are cooperative\
    \ or competitive.\nThe traditional view of externalities is that the network\n\
    exhibits a positive network effect: the more parties that use\nthe technology,\
    \ the more valuable it is to belong to the\nnetwork. For RFID, we might expect\
    \ that as more\ncompanies adopt the technology, the more valuable it will\nbe\
    \ to use it. However, researchers have identiﬁed that\ncompetitive or negative\
    \ externalities may exist when a\nmajor buyer introduces usage of the technology\
    \ to a set of\nusers who do not communicate with each other [75, 134].\nFor example,\
    \ when a major manufacturer promotes EDI\nwith its suppliers, a given supplier\
    \ would like to be the only\none using the technology with that customer in order\
    \ to\ngain more strategic beneﬁts. However, as more competing\nsuppliers are expected\
    \ to adopt, the strategic beneﬁts\nshould be less [132]. A similar effect should\
    \ exist for\nbuyer-mandated RFID usage [49]. Furthermore, it is not\nclear whether\
    \ RFID can be adopted early for competitive\nadvantage or whether it must be adopted\
    \ out of competitive\nnecessity as a hook-up-or-lose-out proposition [46].\nTo\
    \ build the business case managers need to understand\nand bound the extent of\
    \ the RFID system. Toward this end,\nHassan and Chatterjee [79] propose a taxonomy\
    \ of RFID\nsystems. They propose that the taxonomy consists of four\nsystem components,\
    \ including the usage of the system, the\nfrequency with which the system is employed,\
    \ the data\nrequirements of the system, and the physical pieces making\nup the\
    \ system. In addition, managers need to communicate\nthe potential value of any\
    \ new IT application. In a B2B\nstructural setting, it is important to understand\
    \ who will\ngain what beneﬁts. Gebauer and Buxmann [68] note that is\nit is not\
    \ always clear who will beneﬁt from implementation\nof EDI systems. Several studies\
    \ have developed methods of\nvaluing the investment in EDI (e.g., [69, 83, 84]).\
    \ Simi-\nlarly, methods and tools need to be developed to estimate\nRFID value\
    \ to develop the business case.\nAnother aspect of RFID technology that creates\
    \ tensions\namong senior management decision makers interested in\nhigh ROI is\
    \ its nature as technology infrastructure.\nAlthough much of the business press\
    \ suggests that RFID\nhas some ‘‘plug-and-play’’ qualities and will transform\n\
    business capabilities from the pallet level up, the reality is\nprobably somewhat\
    \ different. This provides interesting\nopportunities for new research. For example,\
    \ researchers\ncould test the notion that infrastructure technologies may\nnot\
    \ be the primary drivers of business value themselves,\nbut rather create real\
    \ options for additional follow-on\ninvestments. These real options opportunities\
    \ need to be\ncalculated into the rationale of the original business case\n[26,\
    \ 27].\nIn the absence of clearly understood or uniﬁed stan-\ndards, most organizational\
    \ adoption will be negatively\nimpacted by decision makers’ uncertainty. This\
    \ will ulti-\nmately lead to what economists (e.g., [146]) and account-\ning theorists\
    \ [96] have called the underinvestment problem.\nApplied to RFID technology, the\
    \ underinvestment problem\nsuggests that proﬁt-maximizing ﬁrms will invest less\n\
    than the socially-optimal amount of capital, leading to a\nInf Technol Manage\
    \ (2007) 8:87–110\n95\n123\nless-than-desired level of new business value (and\
    \ social\nwelfare). Thus, an important aspect of the research that\nshould be\
    \ conducted on RFID should span the ﬁrm-to-\nmarket link. At the ﬁrm level, it\
    \ is critical that we deter-\nmine how to construct the appropriate incentives\
    \ to help\nensure that RFID investment practices are effective or\n‘‘right-sized’’\
    \ [11]. From a market perspective, it is critical\nthat RFID technology be properly\
    \ sponsored, so that value-\nrational subsidies and value-sharing arrangements\
    \ can be\nenacted leading to widespread market adoption. Failure to\ncommunicate\
    \ effectively with the market about the future\ntrajectory of RFID technology—for\
    \ example, in terms of\nvendor capabilities, the likelihood that a proposed standard\n\
    will take hold, or the decline in RFID tag costs to the 56 c\nper tag threshold\
    \ [139, 149]—will lead to information\ntransmission difﬁculties at the market\
    \ level [16], reducing\nthe likelihood that the technology will diffuse as rapidly\
    \ as\nis socially optimal.\nRecent research has begun to examine the adoption\
    \ of\nRFID within consortium settings. Yang and Jarvenpaa\n[164] examine the characteristics\
    \ of individual organiza-\ntions that make up the consortium and ask how a member’s\n\
    collective trust is based on previous experience. Quaadgras\n[128] examines what\
    \ ﬁrm characteristics impact the ﬁrm’s\ninterest in joining an RFID consortium.\
    \ The ﬁndings show\nthat the extent to which slack resources are available leads\n\
    to more alliance formation and membership. These and\nother factors related to\
    \ the pattern and dynamics of RFID\nadoption need to be examined and compared\
    \ with other\ninformation technologies.\nIn Table 1, we summarize a series of\
    \ research questions\nrelated to the development, adoption, and implementation\n\
    of RFID that researchers should examine.\n4.2 Using, supporting, and evolving\
    \ RFID within\norganizations and alliances\nResearch in EDI usage has shown that\
    \ integrating EDI\nwith process redesign results in many more beneﬁts than\nEDI\
    \ alone [44, 133]. Similarly, RFID will require con-\nsiderable process redesign\
    \ at all places in the value chain\nwhere the technology is applied. Related to\
    \ this, Davern\nand Kauffman [55] show that the managerial environment\nand the\
    \ political climate within the ﬁrm will impact the\nextent to which the ﬁrm achieves\
    \ what Weill [159] calls\nconversion effectiveness when implementing new systems.\n\
    Similar studies that deal with conversion effectiveness are\nrequired for RFID\
    \ usage. Based on the prior work, we\nexpect there to be signiﬁcant issues associated\
    \ with orga-\nnizational capabilities and absorptive capacity for inte-\ngrating\
    \ emerging technologies into the organization and\nmaking them pay off rapidly\
    \ in an organization’s business\nprocesses [23, 160].\nAn important element of\
    \ realizing value from RFID\ntechnology will be integration with other internal\
    \ and\nexternal systems. Since RFID is an emerging technology,\nthe standards\
    \ associated with it will migrate over the course\nof the next several years,\
    \ as the support for different\ntechnological capabilities improves. We expect\
    \ there to be\nnew issues in two areas similar to what Dai and Kauffman\n[53]\
    \ have discussed in the B2B electronic market tech-\nnology context: cross-application\
    \ integration and cross-\nplatform middleware connectivity. The primary issue\
    \ with\ncross-application integration will be the extent to which\ntoday’s systems\
    \ are capable of handling new real-time\ncapabilities of the enormous data stream\
    \ produced by next-\ngeneration RFID-reliant work systems. We recognize the\n\
    potential for new intermediaries and infomediaries to sys-\ntems integration and\
    \ analytical software capabilities to\nbring this new ﬂood of data into focus.\
    \ The issue of cross-\nplatform middleware potentially is a very vexing one [12].\n\
    Many of the work system structural settings that RFID will\nimpact have legacy\
    \ systems aspects that will need to be\nsimultaneously addressed. Without the\
    \ assistance of new\nthird-party RFID middleware vendors who can ease the\ninfrastructure\
    \ transition and provide patches necessary to\nmake old systems work with new\
    \ ones, the cost of the\nrequired changes and updates may be too large for many\n\
    ﬁrms to absorb.\nAs ﬁrms redesign their business processes around the\nemerging\
    \ capabilities of RFID, they will become ever more\ndependent upon the technology.\
    \ Of course the primary\ndependency is highly positive in that organizations will\n\
    come to operate in a managerial environment that is\nendowed with a new abundance\
    \ of relevant information for\nbusiness process control and perfection. However,\
    \ we\nexpect adopting organizations to become somewhat reliant\non external providers\
    \ (including their RFID tag and reader\nvendors) to provide new systems capabilities\
    \ to make sense\nof the data stream if organizations are to make full use of\n\
    their RFID investments. A second concern has to do with\nthe extent to which vendors\
    \ will continue to control the\ntechnology. Will tag technology continue to be\
    \ controlled\nin an oligopolistic market structure? Will a more compet-\nitive\
    \ marketplace for RFID equipment emerge? Will the\nvendors of RFID readers continue\
    \ to have considerable\nmarket power? To what extent will uncertainties about\n\
    their control and market power diminish organizational\nenthusiasm for RFID investments?\
    \ Clearly, giving con-\nsideration to issues of market control, vendor market\n\
    power, right-sized process outsourcing and market struc-\nture is within the domain\
    \ of RFID business research [11].\nOrganizations also want to be sure that they\
    \ adopt\ntechnology and develop relationships with RFID equip-\nment, systems\
    \ and services vendors that have long-term\nviability and that act in good faith\
    \ on their behalf. The\n96\nInf Technol Manage (2007) 8:87–110\n123\nissues that\
    \ arise bring into focus the need for research\ninvolving different approaches\
    \ to managing risk in RFID-\nrelated vendor relationships [47]. Clearly, adopting\
    \ orga-\nnizations will need to calibrate the risk associated with\nbecoming involved\
    \ in any relationships involving the\nprovision of RFID technology and services,\
    \ where vendor\nstaying power is an issue. Today, this seems especially\nimportant\
    \ for RFID chip and hardware vendors. But in the\nfuture, as RFID database and\
    \ software services become\nmore prominent the concerns will shift to different\

    \ the need for shared interdisciplinary inquiry\nInf Technol Manage (2007) 8:87–110\n\
    97\n123\nvendors. Related to this, Aron et al. [11] have recently\nwritten about\
    \ the importance of shirking, poaching and\nopportunistic renegotiation in the\
    \ context of interorgani-\nzational relationships for outsourcing and systems\
    \ support.\nThe latter two concerns strike us as being particularly\nimportant\
    \ in the RFID context. Poaching, according to\nAron et al. [11], is ‘‘the misuse\
    \ of information that was\noriginally provided for a legitimate contract purpose.’’\n\
    With so much strategic information within RFID systems, a\nvendor could take advantage\
    \ of the adopting organization\nthrough inappropriate parallel use (much as individuals\
    \ are\nconcerning about Microsoft’s and Google’s use of ancillary\nprivate information\
    \ in the process of providing their main\nservices). Opportunistic renegotiation\
    \ of vendor contracts\noccurs when the adopting organization determines that its\n\
    operations are so dependent on the vendor’s services and\nsupport that it has\
    \ no choice but to pay the prices quoted by\nthe vendor. This may come through\
    \ various types of\ntechnological lock-in or process dependencies, but the re-\n\
    sult is a loss of bargaining power by the adopter that is\nreferred to as vendor\
    \ holdup. An important research\nquestion then is, what risks will an organization\
    \ take by\nselecting a vendor when there is some probability that any\nRFID technology\
    \ vendor may not be able to stem the tide\nof technological change? How can we\
    \ determine what\napproach to risk is appropriate in this context?\nThe implementation\
    \ of RFID facilitates data collection\nabout entities at various places in the\
    \ value chain. Critical\nto the creation of this value, however, is that there\
    \ must be\nbusiness process-centered software applications that take\nthe data\
    \ and transform it into managerially useful infor-\nmation. While this might not\
    \ be a major concern if there\nwere only a small amount of data collected by an\
    \ RFID-\nsupported work system, this technology will likely generate\na massive\
    \ amount of new data. How will such data be\nleveraged? What new applications\
    \ will be necessary to\nunlock their strategic and tactical value?\nThis massive\
    \ ﬂood of RFID-collected data could result\nin information overload leading to\
    \ opportunities and chal-\nlenges in data analysis. Research that examines new\
    \ tech-\nniques for data mining and organizing massive data\nwarehouses is needed\
    \ to help organizations take advantage\nof the huge data collection capabilities.\
    \ Knowing where\nevery process-related entity is at all times creates the\npossibility\
    \ of new real-time decision making opportunities.\nDecision scientists can help\
    \ managers understand how this\ntechnology permits organizations to make decisions\
    \ in real-\ntime as the information ﬂoat in supply chain processes is\nreduced\
    \ to zero. Further, data collection from customer-\ndirected RFID applications\
    \ can be mined to generate new\nbusiness intelligence to better serve the customer.\
    \ Under-\nstanding how to use this data for more effective customer\nrelationship\
    \ management is critical for B2C marketing too.\nThe reader should also recognize\
    \ RFID as an IOS\ntechnology that can result in closer alliance partnerships\n\
    and increased transparency in data sharing across the value\nchain. However, several\
    \ questions emerge that complicate\nthe interorganizational dimension of RFID\
    \ usage. For\nexample, how do ﬁrms share the beneﬁts derived from\ninterorganizational\
    \ RFID implementation? Iacovou et al.\n[88] show that small ﬁrms are less likely\
    \ to adopt EDI\ntechnology, which impact gains realized by large ﬁrms\ndoing business\
    \ with these smaller ﬁrms. Riggins and\nMukhopadhyay [134] point out that because\
    \ IOSs cross\ncompany boundaries and extend beyond a manager’s span\nof control,\
    \ they are inherently more risky than internal\ninformation systems. Similarly,\
    \ RFID implemented in the\nB2B structural setting poses new risks that need to\
    \ be\nconsidered in terms of providing incentives to ensure\nproper trading partner\
    \ usage. For example, how might\npurposeful blocking of the reading of tags result\
    \ in errors at\nthe other end of the B2B linkage?12 What penalties will be\nimposed\
    \ when trading partners misapply or misuse the\ntechnology? What costs will result\
    \ from improperly tagged\nitems?\nAnother important question to ask when RFID\
    \ is\nimplemented in the B2B structural setting is who owns the\ntechnology? Bakos\
    \ and Nault [20] apply the theory of\nincomplete contracts to show that in the\
    \ absence of an\nindispensable asset orindispensable participant that con-\ntrols\
    \ the ﬂow of value, sole ownership is not the optimal\nownership structure. Instead,\
    \ joint ownership should occur.\nWithin the RFID context, then, do the RFID tag\
    \ and/or the\nRFID reader represent indispensable assets? If so, should\nthe entire\
    \ RFID system be owned by one ﬁrm? For\nexample, should the buyer provide and\
    \ own the tags for the\nsupplier’s items?\nThus, it should be clear to the reader\
    \ that there are many\nissues that fall within the overall scope of the work systems\n\
    and structural settings that are associated with RFID\nimplementations.\nThey\n\
    cover\nthe\nﬁrm-to-ﬁrm,\nﬁrm-\nto-market and ﬁrm-to-industry levels of analysis,\
    \ and are\ndeveloped based on the different incentives, perspectives\nand potential\

    \ is a technical\napproach, involving the creation of a ‘‘blocker tag’’ that is\

    \ critical to ensure\nthe adoption and appropriate use of RFID. We envision a\n\
    number of issues that will be of signiﬁcant research interest\nthat are related\
    \ to the role of the worker. The ﬁrst involves\nthe qualities of RFID technologies,\
    \ and the extent to which\nthey will substitute for the capabilities of human\

    \ privacy in a variety of normal retail business\nsettings [2], including supermarkets,\
    \ groceries and depart-\nment stores where RFID has been recognized as being of\n\
    potentially high payoff [97]. The 2003 protest against\nGillette Corporation’s\
    \ insertion of RFID tags into men’s\nshaver packages is one such instance [34,\
    \ 56]. In addition,\nBarry Steinhart, Director of the American Civil Liberties\n\
    Union’s (ACLU) Technology and Liberty Program notes in\nhis 2004 testimony to\
    \ the Commerce, Trade and Consumer\nProtection Committee of the U.S. House of\
    \ Representative\nSubcommittee on Energy and Commerce that ‘‘[t]he\nprivacy issues\
    \ raised by RFID tags are vitally important\nbecause they are representative of\
    \ a larger trend in the\nUnited States: the seemingly inexorable drift toward\
    \ a\nsurveillance society. As Congress considers the privacy\nissues posed by\
    \ RFID chips, I urge you to view them in the\nlarger context—a world that is increasingly\
    \ becoming a sea\nof data and databases, where the government and private\ncorporations\
    \ alike are gathering more and more details\nabout our everyday existence’’ [8].13\
    \ We foresee similar\nconcerns in organizational work systems environments,\n\
    where employees may object to unnecessary tracking and\nsurveillance, and other\
    \ intrusive collection of private\ninformation about their work habits.\nWith\
    \ the increased concerns about personal privacy\nprotection, identity theft, and\
    \ the intrusion of various\norganizations into people’s personal lives, much more\n\
    research needs to be conducted that examines the role and\nimpact of RFID on invasion\
    \ of personal privacy. The\nability to tag individual products that will eventually\
    \ be\nbrought into consumers’ homes raises questions of trust\nthat must be examined.\
    \ How will consumers gain conﬁ-\ndence that sellers will respect their privacy?\
    \ Should gov-\nernment step in and mandate stricter compliance on the\npart of\
    \ sellers? Would that result in increased consumer\nconﬁdence?\nFurther research\
    \ needs to be conducted on the impact on\nan individual’s health when many more\
    \ items are being\nsubjected to electromagnetic scans. Will the public feel\n\
    conﬁdent that their health is being protected? What is the\nrole of government\
    \ in ensuring public safety? Cantwell\n[39] points to the history of public concerns\
    \ with emerging\ntechnologies—from cellular phones to food-related genet-\nically\
    \ modiﬁed organisms to Pentium III processor serial\nnumbers—and reminds us that\
    \ success is often path-\ndependent, in spite of the beneﬁcial qualities of the\
    \ tech-\nnologies themselves. Because these issues will directly\naffect business\
    \ adoption and usage of this technology,\nunderstanding the impact of RFID related\
    \ to these issues is\nrelevant for the IS research and business communities.\n\
    Many issues related to developing the original business\ncase must be revisited\
    \ after implementation to verify the\nbusiness value generated by RFID. A main\
    \ component of\nthe projected value from RFID use is the expected cost\nreduction.\
    \ Prior research on EDI has shown that in certain\ncases major cost reductions\
    \ were not realized, especially\nfor ﬁrms with little market power [154]. If EDI\
    \ is not\nimplemented with all trading partners, then the user must\ncontinue\
    \ to run manual systems in parallel to the EDI\nsystem. Therefore, EDI may be\
    \ just another layer of costs,\nrather than a major cost reduction tool. In the\
    \ case of RFID,\nif some shipments entering the factory are tagged, but\nothers\
    \ are not and must be handled manually, to what\nextent will RFID actually result\
    \ in reduced costs?\nAnother issue related to value is the presence of network\n\
    externality effects. We already mentioned the notion that\nRFID likely exhibits\
    \ a direct network externality in that the\nmore adopters of a speciﬁc RFID standard,\
    \ the more\nvaluable it is to adopt [57]. Such network externalities arise\nfrom\
    \ complementarities among the components of a net-\nwork. In addition to adopters\
    \ of RFID tags and the asso-\nciated readers (e.g., buyers and suppliers), it\
    \ is also\npossible to consider the network externalities that arise\nfrom other\
    \ kinds of components in a network, for example,\nthe multiple kinds of software\
    \ solutions that translate RFID\n13 Another interesting story is told about the\
    \ unannounced use of\nRFID in delegates’ badges for the World Summit on the Information\n\
    Society (WSIS), held in Geneva, Switzerland in mid-December 2003\nas reported\
    \ by the Washington Post [87]. The delegates included\nprime ministers, presidents,\
    \ and other senior government ofﬁcials\nfrom 174 countries who were not told that\
    \ RFID would be used to\ntrack their movements. The irony of this story relative\
    \ to Steinhart’s\nclaim of a ‘‘drift to a surveillance society’’ is that one of\
    \ the primary\nroles of the WSIS is to act as an international standard-bearer\
    \ for\nintellectual property rights and individual privacy.\n100\nInf Technol\

    \ The difﬁculties in value estimation\nstem from the uncertainties associated\

    issue for the measurement of value is who gets what ben-\neﬁt? If adoption is\
    \ mandated, as in the case of the suppliers\nof Wal-Mart and the United States\
    \ Department of Defense,\nhow should the resulting value ﬂows be shared? And how\n\
    is value related to the speciﬁc direction and volume of\ninformation transmitted?\
    \ Further, some value will be\nintangible and diffused widely across the related\
    \ work\nsystem, the ﬁrm, and to other business partners. Thus, a\nnumber of rich\
    \ issues are worthwhile to pursue in research\nrelated to both the prospective\
    \ assessment and the retro-\nspective impacts for RFID.\nOrganizations are likely\
    \ to see other impacts from RFID\nat the market structure level. Within the B2B\
    \ setting,\nMalone et al. [111] predicted that dramatic reductions in\ncosts due\
    \ to IT would result in an increase in the number of\nsuppliers, as ﬁrms move\
    \ away from hierarchical structure\nfor sourcing and business organization toward\
    \ a market-\nfocused approach. In supply procurement, Bakos and\nBrynjolfsson\
    \ [18, 19] have shown that the optimal number\nof suppliers is not necessarily\
    \ increased, since the initiator\nof the technology needs to maintain a relatively\
    \ small\nnumber of suppliers in order to get them to invest an\nappropriate amount\
    \ in the new technology. Clemons\net al.’s [48] move-to-the-middle hypothesis\
    \ perspective\nalso suggests the countervailing risks associated with the\nmove\
    \ to pure market-based forms for procurement. We\nbelieve that the observed outcomes\
    \ should be ‘‘in the\nmiddle,’’ mixing a combination of greater access to the\n\
    lower prices of a competitive market while taking advan-\ntage of the risk mitigation\
    \ beneﬁts associated with strong,\nlong-term procurement partnerships.\nIn Table\
    \ 3, we summarize a number of research ques-\ntions that deal with the impacts\
    \ of RFID on individuals,\norganizations and markets.\n5 Conclusion\nAs the year\
    \ 2006 inaugurates a new era of RFID technol-\nogy usage, these and other research\
    \ questions will emerge\nthat must be examined by IS researchers. This paper out-\n\
    lines a broad agenda for considering a variety of issues\nrelated to the ﬁrm,\
    \ industry relationships, RFID technology\ninnovation, and customer and worker\
    \ privacy. We also\nrecognized that RFID technology should be thought of as a\n\
    member of a new class of technologies with multiple\nmobility,\norganizational\n\
    and\nsystems\ntechnolo-\ngies—MOST—characteristics. We argued that RFID sup-\n\
    ports informational mobility for the range of tagable\nentities that suit the\
    \ managerial needs of ﬁrms that wish to\ntrack them. We also pointed out that\
    \ such tagging and\ntracking may lead to an increasingly real-time practice for\n\
    decision support in contexts where the temporal control of\nthe collection of\
    \ relevant data traditionally has been difﬁ-\ncult and costly.\nThe wide assortment\
    \ of RFID-related issues we have\nraised here are consistent with the nomological\
    \ net pro-\nposed by Benbasat and Zmud [28]. However, some might\nargue that many\
    \ of these issues do not fall within the tra-\nditional domain of research within\
    \ the IS research com-\nmunity as it pertains to the IT artifact [123]. In this\
    \ paper,\nwe have described RFID technology as the basis for many\nIT-reliant\
    \ work systems [7], in which case their study\nbecomes very central to IS research.\
    \ We believe that for the\nIS researcher, RFID technology represents a type of\
    \ IT\nartifact that is embedded in IT-reliant work systems. By\naugmenting Benbasat\
    \ and Zmud’s [28] nomological net\nwith Alter’s [7] more inclusive thinking, the\
    \ RFID-related\nresearch issues proposed here become even more pertinent\nto IS\
    \ researchers.14 Benbasat and Zmud [28] further note\n14 Orlikowski and Iacono\
    \ [121, pp. 121–122] state that the ‘‘the ﬁeld\nof Information Systems (IS), which\
    \ is premised on the centrality of\ninformation technology in everyday life, has\
    \ not deeply engaged its\ncore subject matter—the information technology (IT)\
    \ artifact [italics\nadded for emphasis]. ... IS researchers tend to focus their\
    \ theoretical\nattention elsewhere, for example, on the context within which some\n\
    usually unspeciﬁed technology is seen to operate, on the discrete\nprocessing\
    \ capabilities of the artifacts (separate from how they\noperate in context),\
    \ or on the dependent variable (that which the\ntechnology presumably changes\
    \ as it is developed, implemented and\nused). ... As a consequence, IT artifacts\
    \ tend to be taken for granted or\nare presumed to be unproblematic.’’ Alter [7,\
    \ p. 367], who also\nquotes Orlikowski and Iacono [121], deﬁnes an IT-reliant\
    \ work sys-\ntem as ‘‘work systems whose efﬁcient and/or effective operation\n\
    depends on IT.’’ IS researchers should be undeterred by the catego-\nrizations\
    \ and discussions of what is within and outside ‘‘the box’’\nrelative to RFID.\
    \ Our view is that RFID technology presents a number\nof interesting issues at\
    \ the nexus of mobility, organizational and\nsystems technologies, and we should\
    \ seek to deﬁne how the tech-\nnology should be understood, invested in, implemented,\
    \ managed,\nreﬁned and integrated within the organization and across its business\n\
    boundaries to achieve the greatest possible business and social value.\nInf Technol\

    \ in terms\nthat can be deﬁned by the movement of tagged items close\nto or beyond\

    \ in this way (e.g.,\npilfered inventory items, mistakenly moved equipment, the\n\
    movement of trucks into a repair facility, and so on).\nThe opportunities for\
    \ research should be of signiﬁcant\ninterest to both doctoral students who are\
    \ interested in\ndeveloping high quality thesis research, as well junior\nfaculty,\
    \ whom we encourage to seek out new opportunities\nfor carrying out theory-building,\
    \ theory-testing, theory-\nextending and theory-challenging research. As Clemons\n\
    and Weber [50] have reminded us, some of the most\ninteresting opportunities in\
    \ research come about when\ntechnology changes the underlying market equilibrium\
    \ for\ninterﬁrm\ncompetition.\nMoreover,\nRFID\nwill\noffer\nresearchers many\
    \ opportunities for unique research designs\nand very large-scale data collection—perhaps\
    \ larger in size\nthan we have seen in supply chain management contexts to\ndate.\
    \ We believe that new methods associated with quasi-\nexperimental research designs\
    \ and analysis methods will be\nespecially useful, as will be newly emerging data\
    \ mining\nand statistical methods that are intended for very large\nsamples. With\
    \ so much data on hand, researchers will be\nable to identify the speciﬁc kinds\
    \ of conditions under\nwhich they wish to study the variety of issues that arise\n\
    around RFID tagging, including interorganizational sys-\ntems performance, information\
    \ quality and value relative to\nspeciﬁc managerial goals, and the risks and value\
    \ losses\nassociated with imperfections in RFID-based work sys-\ntems. The recent\
    \ work by Loebbecke [109, 110] that\nexamines the applications of RFID tagging\
    \ in a retail\nsupply chain setting offers useful perspectives on the kinds\n\
    of problems that arise. Case studies of this sort will con-\ntinue to be of great\
    \ value to the research community in the\ncoming years.\nIn RFID-reliant work\
    \ systems, researchers also will be\nable to take advantage of the newly-available\
    \ instrumen-\ntation for measuring supply chain entities (e.g., packages,\npallets,\
    \ containers, trucks, etc.) in a manner that will create\nmanagerially relevant\
    \ information about ‘‘entity trajecto-\nries’’ that has not been available before\
    \ without prohibitive\ncosts.15 This is similar to what companies such as Federal\n\
    Express already do for packages they handle in the\ncontrolled environments of\
    \ their trucks, airline cargo\ncontainers and processing centers. They conﬁrm\
    \ for the\ncustomer when a package was received, where it is in the\nshipment\
    \ process, and when it is likely to be delivered to its\ndestination. However,\
    \ the difference in RFID settings is\nthat the movement of the relevant entities\
    \ will be far less\n‘‘scripted’’ than with package transshipments. Nor will the\n\
    appropriate\nmanagerial\ninformation\nbe\npre-speciﬁed.\nHowever, using RFID may\
    \ soon allow managers to\ndevelop such scripts for the various tagable entities\
    \ in their\noperations.\nWe further expect that RFID-delivered entity informa-\n\
    tion will become relevant on a ‘‘management-by-query’’\nbasis. This might occur\
    \ in hospital operations settings\nwhere there is a need to identify the location\
    \ of expensive\nmedical equipment to ensure its availability for a speciﬁc\nmedical\
    \ or surgical procedure. In addition, hospital man-\nagers will be able to construct\
    \ query-driven naturally\noccurring experiments within RFID-reliant work systems\n\
    to determine the extent to which RFID provides leverage\nfor\nminimizing\nmisplacement\n\
    of\nexpensive\nmedical\ndevices, controlling leasing expenses for extra equipment,\n\
    or identifying the conditions under which medical samples\nfail to be properly\
    \ processed in support of a variety of\nhealthcare management services.\nIn closing,\
    \ we should point out that there is a signiﬁcant\nbody of literature on IS and\
    \ IT that points to the role of\nemerging technologies in operating and business\
    \ process\nsettings as being important complements in the production\nof value.\
    \ As Brynjolfsson et al. [38] remind us, the\nextraordinary\nexpenditures\nassociated\n\
    with\nthe\n‘‘IT\ninvestment iceberg’’ lurk beneath the surface of the many\nprocess,\
    \ organizational, logistics and market settings in\nwhich RFID-based systems will\
    \ be deployed. So it stands\nto reason that many process-enabling complementary\n\
    investments will be necessary to release the value associ-\nated with RFID. These\
    \ are likely to include training, con-\nﬁguration and deployment controls, and\
    \ other managerial\nsupport approaches. Although it will take time to show\nempirical\

    is one of the prominent applications area among others where blockchain is supposed
    to make a strong impact. It is generating wide range of opportunities and possibilities
    in current healthcare systems. Therefore, this paper is all about exploring the
    potential applications of blockchain technology in current healthcare systems
    and highlights the most important requirements to fulfill the need of such systems
    such as trustless and transparent healthcare systems. In addition, this work also
    presents the challenges and obstacles needed to resolve before the successful
    adoption of blockchain technology in healthcare systems. Furthermore, we introduce
    the smart contract for blockchain based healthcare systems which is key for defining
    the pre-defined agreements among various involved stakeholders. Published in:

    The research community has started to realize the potential of blockchain beyond
    the financial applications. Blockchain as a decentralized technology can be utilized
    in immense useful applications such as healthcare, logistics, supply chain management
    and Internet of Things (IoTs) among others [1], [2], [3]. Blockchain provides
    secure distributed database that can perform their tasks without any intervention
    of third-party or central administration. It is highly useful in the case when
    various relevant parties want to access same kind of the information. Thus, blockchain
    based systems have huge potential to minimize the cost and resources of current
    intermediates. Blockchain, generally uses cryptographic (such as hash functions,
    asymmetric encryption and digital signatures) based approaches among various stakeholders
    in a given system that helps in preserving trust among them while interaction.
    Internet of things (IoTs) [4] and other communication related technologies (such
    as 5G) [5], [6] are putting a huge impact on the healthcare services and providing
    consumer better and improved medical services but provides an opportunity to the
    involved stakeholders to generate the revenue. Medical data storing and sharing
    is an integral part in healthcare systems in order to enhance the quality and
    services of overall healthcare systems. However, sharing data records among various
    entities through unsecure means can lead to leakage of the patient’s personal
    and critical information. Also, the lack of the user control over their personal
    information can cause harmful consequences such as unauthorized entities can access
    the personal medical information. While sharing the patients information might
    be fragmented in various healthcare systems and that can lead to various risks
    [3]. One of the core issues in current electronic health/medical records (EHR/EMR)
    is maintaining the interoperability among various involved stakeholders [7]. This
    issue may cause obstacles in the data transaction among each other. The lack of
    coordinated data management and sharing mechanism among various entities may cause
    in fragmentation of the healthcare information. Apart from interoperability, data
    security and privacy are another key challenges in the current ways of data storing
    and sharing data through EHR/EMR systems [7], [9]. Most of the patients are hesitant
    about sharing and storing their personal medical information due to the data leakage
    and potential shortcoming in security mechanism [10], [11]. Therefore, there is
    a clear need of distributed way of data sharing and storing where patients are
    more sure about their data security and privacy and in addition all the involved
    stakeholders can see the holistic view of overall transaction and interactions
    [7]. Therefore, considering these challenges in the current healthcare systems,
    it is vital to utlilize the potential blockchain technology in the healthcare
    sector [3]. Blockchain technology can play a key role in number of healthcare
    applications, for example, using blockchain for electronic healthcare records
    (EHR/EMR) can ensure the security of the critical information of the patients
    and can make sure that only valid and authorized entities should access the data
    [8], [12], [13], [14]. Blockchain for healthcare also uses the concept of smart
    contracts which enables trustless features among various entities in the system.
    Smart contracts consist of computer program that presents the agreements and principles
    on which all the involved parties in the network agrees upon and therefore no
    trusted third party is required [15], [16]. Blockchain based healthcare system
    are also proposed in a way that they support the interoperability feature in the
    system. Hence, the main aim of this work is to overview and explore the blockchain
    technology for the purpose of healthcare based applications. In addition to that,
    this paper discusses the potential requirement and challenges for building blockchain
    based healthcare systems. Furthermore, we will also discuss the the need of the
    smart contracts for the blockchain based healthcare systems. The rest of the paper
    is organized as follows: Section II defines the opportunities of the blockchain
    in healthcare systems and section III highlights the key requirements needed for
    building such systems. Section IV discusses the potential challenges and obstacles
    in the way of blockchain helathcare systems. Section V presents the use of smart
    contracts for blockchain based healthcare systems. Section VI provides the discussion
    and future scope and we conclude in section VII. SECTION II. Blockchain Applications
    in Healthcare Industry Blockchain as a decentralized and distributed technology
    has enormous applications in healthcare domain. Blockchain technology mainly introduced
    for the banking and finance sector, but now intended to provide safer ways of
    data sharing between providers, payers and patients in the healthcare systems.
    Due to immense potential and realistic applicability of blockchain in healthcare
    system, researchers has started to explore potential use cases for blockchain
    in healthcare industry. We briefly discuss few of them below as shown in Figure
    1 and Table I: A. Clinical Data Sharing A crucial and key application of blockchain
    in healthcare is the sharing of medical data among various entities in the system.
    EHRs and EMRs contain highly critical and sensitive medical information related
    to the patient which need to be securely stored, shared, processed and accessed.
    Thus, in order to improve and enhance the quality of healthcare services, the
    medical information need to be stored and shared frequently among various relevant
    participants such as patients, doctors, healthcare service providers, pharmacies,
    insurance companies and researchers among others. In general, these kind of critical
    data sharing require strong measures for transparency and accountability while
    data transactions. Therefore, blockchain adds more transparency in such cases
    as it maintains a distributed ledger among all involved entities within the network.
    The blockchain provides a trustable and secure way of data sharing and management
    mechanisms where all parties are aware of transactions [14], [17], [18], [19].
    B. Global Data Sharing There are also certain occasions, where patients travel
    outside their own country for tourism purposes or for any other reasons. There
    are also situations when they may require to consult with a doctor for treatment
    of any disease. In that case, in order to provide better health services, respective
    doctors/hospitals of the other country should have knowledge of the patient healthcare
    information. Through blockchain based approaches, the medical information can
    easily be shared with the required entities residing in the other country and
    the patient would be consent and have control over the data. In order to receive
    a better medical treatment outside the country, the medical history of the respective
    patient should be known for example, the respective patient has any kind of allergy
    to some medicines or knowledge of his/her recent treatment. Thus the medical history
    needs to be securely accessed by the service provider [3], [18]. C. Maintaining
    Medical History Blockchain technology can also be well-utilized to store and maintain
    the medical history of the patients. For example, sometimes patients visit disconnected
    hospitals and thus the overall chain of the medical history might not be available
    or well-maintained (because of discontinuity and unavailability of previous records).
    In order to overcome such issues, blockchain can be useful in maintaining the
    history of records for each visit to any hospital. In addition, due to unavailability
    of the some disconnected data related to medical/laboratory reports, the patients
    again have to repeat the same medical tests. It will not only increase the cost
    of repeating the same laboratory test, but it can also be risky to do some test
    with high radiations again and again [8], [20]. Fig. 1 Blockchain utilization
    in various healthcare applications. Show All TABLE I Various applications areas
    of blockchain based healthcare systems D. Research and Clinical Trials Clinical
    trials represent another key and valuable process in the healthcare sector that
    require appropriate monitoring at each stage of the trail. For example, collection
    of required data, trial mechanism and monitoring and data management of trails
    [21], [22], [23]. These trial stages will consume heaps of resources as multiple
    parties need to coordinate with each other. These phases of trails also required
    massive trust among the various involved entities. Therefore, the blockchain can
    be a vital tool to deal with such research trials where each phase can be properly
    traced and data can be managed and analyzed without much waste of resources. E.
    Healthcare Data Access Control With the recent technological advancements users
    control/grip over their own data is becoming weak. Especially, for the healthcare
    data, users are mostly unaware regarding which entities access their medical data
    and for what purposes and whether they are authorized to access it. For example
    in the case of EHR/EMR, various healthcare service providers are associated and
    patients are not fully aware about the parties that are accessing, storage and
    sharing of their medical data. Blockchain technology can allow the patients not
    only access their medical information in a more secure and safer way but also
    ensure only authorized entities can access and alter the data [8], [20], [24].
    F. Drug Supply Chain Management Medical drug supply management is crucial in the
    modern medicine industry but it still suffers from various complexities and losses
    because of counterfeiters and pilfering. Blockchain can keep the traceability
    of such supply chain operations and enhance the integrity of the overall process
    [18], [25], [26]. The blockchain will be helpful in verifying the authenticity
    of the drugs and its supply chain to the authorized parties. Thus, blockchain
    can be vital in monitoring the various phases in the drug supply chain management
    and give access to the valid users. G. Billing/Payers Traditional modes of patient
    billing systems are considered to be very complex and are exposed to billing related
    frauds. In addition to this, the process in most of the cases take more resources
    and time to receive all the required bills. It is expected that blockchain based
    payment solutions will make the billing process much more easier as compared with
    traditional billing approaches, where it takes several days to claim the bills.
    Also in the case the insurance company is involved in the paying process, it even
    takes several weeks to claim the bills. Blockchain would be a useful tool in such
    scenarios, where the insurance company is there for the payment. In addition,
    this also makes the insurance claims faster and can decrease the extra resources,
    time and cost [26], [27]. SECTION III. Key Requirements In this section, the core
    focus is to highlight the key requirements needed while proposing a blockchain
    based healthcare system as shown in Table II. A. Nationwide Interoperability This
    is one of the key requirements for blockchain based healthcare systems. The current
    healthcare system lacks the nationwide interoperability which is considered as
    one of the strongest obstacles in current healthcare management systems. One of
    the major reasons for this is the lack of universal standards for interoperability.
    Blockchain promises to empower EHR interoperability for the current healthcare
    systems [20], [24]. TABLE II Key requirements in blockchain based healthcare systems
    B. Data Security Another vital requirement while designing such blockchain healthcare
    systems is to secure the patients sensitive data. As there are multiple entities
    involved in the blockchain based healthcare mechanisms, the security should be
    at the prime focus. Blockchain is expected to ensure more security, privacy and
    trust as compared with traditional healthcare systems. One of the primary reason
    for more privacy and trust is because all the involved entities are aware of all
    the data transaction within the system [28], [29], [30]. C. Data consistency/Integrity/Immutability
    One of the challenges in current healthcare management systems is the fragmentation
    and inconsistency of the medical data. Data inconsistency may cause delay and
    higher costs to complete the overall healthcare process for any user. Therefore,
    a blockchain based healthcare system must ensure that the healthcare data is consistent
    and unfeasible to be altered by unauthorized entities [24], [29], [30]. D. Cost/Resources
    Effectiveness Current healthcare systems are consuming more resources in terms
    of cost, computations, time and physical resources. For example, in most of the
    transactions, there needs to be intermediates that may take more delay or resources
    to perform the specific tasks [20], [24]. One of the key requirements will be
    to reduce the transactions cost/delay that could be because of third-parties,
    multiple involved entities or for any other reasons. E. Trustless and Transparent
    With the current healthcare system, pre-existing trust need to be developed among
    various stakeholders to ensure the safer data storing and sharing processes. As
    the data is stored and shared among various parties, maintaining complete trust
    and data transparency would be a big ask [21], [22], [31]. A blockchain based
    healthcare system will eliminate the intermediates overhead, so it should built
    trustless and transparent healthcare systems. F. Complexity Current multi-stakeholders
    based healthcare systems are relatively more complex in terms of storage, sharing
    and processing the medical data and other billing related information. Therefore,
    one of the requirements for a blockchain-healthcare system is to have less complex
    processes for the healthcare systems to avoid complexities and unnecessary delays
    at various phases [20]. SECTION IV. Potential Challenges Following, we identified
    some of the potential challenges for building blockchain based healthcare systems
    that need to be addressed properly before the actual deployment. A. Scalability
    Restrictions One of the potential challenges in blockchain healthcare would be
    of the scalability. The trade-off between the available computing capabilities
    versus the amount of medical transactions could limit the scalability of such
    healthcare systems [32]. B. High Development Cost The blockchain based healthcare
    systems may take high development and operation costs. The government and healthcare
    sector still need to define the different kinds of development, operations and
    total deployment cost for all involved stakeholders. Thus, it is crucial to find
    the optimal ways to reduce the overall cost and resources for building such systems
    [20], [24]. C. Standardization Challenges For the successful deployment in healthcare
    applications, appropriate standards must be defined by standardization bodies
    [9], [19]. For example, in the case of healthcare information stored on the blockchain,
    it should be made clear that what data, size and format can be sent to blockchain.
    Thus, it must be defined well what medical data is stored on or off the blockchain
    [20], [24], [32]. D. Cultural Resistance The current society is mostly habitual
    of such healthcare processes that are accessed either through paperwork based
    procedures or in some cases through online means such as EHR/EMR and other online
    health services [19], [24]. In the current time, the patients data is not so commonly
    shared with multiple parties. Therefore this cultural shift will be one of the
    major challenges as changing the behavior of the people towards data sharing in
    a distributed way will require some efforts [33]. E. Regulatory Uncertainty Regulatory
    bodies would face challenges in order to define the policies that will consider
    the collaboration of various stakeholders to draft a complete ecosystem that also
    takes into account the existing regulatory framework. The Health Insurance Portability
    and Accountability Act (HIPAA) [34] is also currently working on defining the
    standards to preserve the privacy of users medical records. F. Security and Privacy
    Concerns Blockchain technology with healthcare data provides some security features
    [9], [14]. However, security and privacy are still the foremost concerns in blockchain
    based healthcare and require concrete security solutions. For example, an authorized
    entity should be able to access the data and data storage and sharing must be
    done in a secure way [28], [29], [30], [32]. G. Unwillingness to Share Some of
    the stakeholders providing healthcare services still hesitate to share the data
    with other parties. For example, hospitals and insurance payers do not want to
    share the data very easily to other entities [2], [3], [8]. One of the reasons
    for this can be that the hospital may want to keep the cost data to themselves
    and may set different costs for different patients. Hence, the trust must be developed
    between various entities so that each entity should agree to share the data for
    better healthcare systems. SECTION V. Smart Contracts for Blockchain-aware Healthcare
    Systems A Smart Contract is an integral part of the blockchain based applications.
    It is an agreement made among various involved parties in the defined system.
    A smart contract is a computer protocol that follows specific rules, codes and
    constraints agreed by all participants in the network. For example, a smart contract
    for banking transactions or financial purposes includes all the terms and conditions
    agreed by each stakeholder available in that process. The traditional contracts
    are considered to be lengthy and experienced as a resource consuming process that
    is made either in form of writing or any actions [15], [16]. In contrast, smart
    contracts are computer based digital programs which are self-executive when the
    required terms are fulfilled. Healthcare systems enable a number of relevant parties
    to work collaboratively and efficiently for better and enhanced medical services.
    Therefore, defining appropriate rules in the smart contract for healthcare will
    be crucial and must include the consent of all the relevant parties. In the healthcare
    blockchain, the patient and other stakeholders in the network should set up their
    details and signed the agreement for accepting the terms in order to develop the
    requirements in the smart contract [35]. For example, which hospitals can store
    and share the patient data, which doctors can access and append the data and what
    kind of data is available for pharmacy and laboratory. Figure 2 highlights the
    use of smart contracts in blockchain based healthcare systems where multiple service
    providers are operating. Once the appointment between patient, healthcare providers
    and pharmacists specified in the contract takes place and the transaction containing
    information about the data arrives to the address of the smart contract, then
    the distributed virtual machine of the blockchain executes the programming code
    process. Some of the fundamental elements which smart contracts for the healthcare
    may contain is shown in figure 2, for example; Address specifies the address for
    the patient’s data on the database and address itself can be stored in blockchain;
    Access − code is a number that denotes to whom the patient gives permission of
    accessing the information such as doctor or any third party like relatives and
    friends; state represents the variables or function in the system and code specifies
    the agreement in which stakeholders signed it and other function to be performed.
    Once they agreed the terms, then the transaction details will record in the system
    and also the other entities will receive the transaction information. As compared
    with existing available contracts, a smart contract is faster as well as it also
    decreases the time for executing and deploying the patients data. Since it a decentralized
    system, no one can act as a patient or healthcare provider. This system is relatively
    more safe to protect any medical document. Hackers cannot be able to modify or
    edit the document without the patients permission. A Smart Contract can directly
    deal with the stakeholders, whose signature is in the legal agreement. A Smart
    contract is considered as more cost-efficient because it will use less resources
    and eliminate the additional costs. Smart contracts are more trustworthy by having
    the property of immutable which means no one can modify /edit or delete the patient
    data without the patient’s permission and this can be automatically encrypt the
    protocol/rules. The Smart Contract simplifies the transaction happening in the
    Blockchain and makes it easier to perform [16], [35]. In addition to the useful
    advantages of building smart contracts, there are also needs to address some challenges
    for successful utilization of smart contracts in healthcare systems. For example,
    if the codes or rules are written wrong (having some error) then the process will
    make a mistake. Without programmable knowledge, its not easy to write or understand
    the algorithm and if the mistakes happen in the code, then it is very costly to
    fix a bug. There is also an issue with the legal framework in a smart contract
    as this is not validated by the government completely. A Smart Contract needs
    an invoking support to perform some tasks, meaning that it cannot perform automatically
    without any action or support [36]. Fig. 2 Smart contract for healthcare scenario.
    Show All SECTION VI. Discussion and Future Scope The healthcare industry is facing
    digital revolution because of rapid developments in Information Communication
    Technology (ICT). The hype regarding the utilization of blockchain in the healthcare
    seems to be a reality in the coming future as researchers are exploring various
    aspects of blockchain healthcare systems. The top priority in healthcare landscape
    is to provide secure and safer means of accessing the patients’s medical information
    throughout the whole process. Blockchain technology assumed to be among one of
    the suitable way of storing and sharing the medical information and by this only
    authorized entities are able to access the healthcare data. The potential of blockchain
    in healthcare is being realized by various involved stakeholders and its immense
    impact to improve the healthcare industry in terms of better medical services
    for the required patients and enhanced healthcare economy and revenues. One of
    the vital on-going obstacle in the current EHR systems is lack of nationwide healthcare
    interoperability and blockchain is the potential technology to handle this issue
    to some extent. Apart from other questions, blockchain should address the the
    concerns regarding the storage of medical data. As blockchain itself is very restricted
    in terms of storing the actual healthcare data, so there is wider scope to propose
    concrete solutions for secure storage of the medical information. One solution
    for this is already available in the literature which offers to store the actual
    data in the server/database and the address of that data can be stored in the
    blockchain. The data retrieval or append and other operations can be done using
    that address which is stored in blockchain and linked with the database. In addition,
    concrete answers are also required for various security measures, for example
    what kind of security (symmetric/asymmetric) is more suitable for such healthcare
    applications and how things like key managements will be handled. Moreover, certain
    healthcare use cases require solutions that should be anonymous, transparent and
    repudiation. The future of blockchain in the healthcare sector seems to be quite
    prominent and visionary. However, the practicality of the healthcare application
    using blockchain is mostly untested yet. But with the features that blockchain
    promises to add in the current healthcare systems would enable improved and better
    quality of healthcare services. Blockchain technology will empower the patients
    to take more control of their medical data and can handle their healthcare information
    in appropriate ways for managing overall health conditions. By this, an accurate,
    faster and improved data sharing healthcare mechanism could be drafted that can
    fulfill the needs of current healthcare requirements and also facilities the patients
    with the desired medical services. SECTION VII. Conclusion With the recent advancements
    in internet and network technologies, there is a clear need of the enhancement
    in the quality of medical and healthcare services. There are numerous shortcomings
    in the current healthcare systems that seek solutions based on distributed and
    decentralized approaches. In this context, blockchain technology can play a leading
    role in providing the solutions that are decentralized and can ensure the security
    and integrity of the medical information. Therefore, the main focus of this work
    is to provide an overview of blockchain technology in the healthcare sector. This
    article identifies key application areas in the healthcare domain where blockchain
    technology can be a useful addition. Moreover, various requirements and challenges
    for blockchain based healthcare systems are presented in this work. Finally the
    concept of smart contracts for blockchain based healthcare systems is highlighted.

    The duality of technology is used as our theoretical lens to understand the interactions
    between organization and technology. The results confirm the duality that gaining
    the benefits of IoT in asset management produces unexpected social changes that
    lead to structural transformation of the organization. IoT can provide organizations
    with many benefits, after having dealt with unexpected risks and making the necessary
    organizational changes. There is a need to introduce changes to the organization,
    processes and systems, to develop capabilities and ensure that IoT fits the organization’s
    purposes. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Internet of

    of technologyStructuration theory 1. Introduction The “Internet of Things” (IoT),
    is a growing network of objects that communicate between themselves and other
    internet-enabled devices over the Internet (Hounsell, Shrestha, Piao, & McDonald,
    2009; Ramos, Augusto, & Shapiro, 2008). IoT allows us to monitor and control the
    physical world remotely (Ramos et al., 2008). As such, adopting IoT may provide
    a wide variety of benefits for organizations and the resulting big data offers
    the potential for organizations to obtain valuable insights (Dwivedi et al., 2017;
    Hashem et al., 2015). However, risks and factors abound which may have significant,
    unintended effects on organizations and their intention in utilizing IoT (Scarfo,
    2014). IoT may become part of the structures which constrain individual actions.
    For example, adopting IoT for access control to enter public transportation may
    improve efficiency, but removing the human element of conductors in trains and
    busses may introduce unexpected risks such as increased incidences of vandalism,
    requiring new organizational structures to mitigate these risks. Literature mentions
    different benefits and risks for organizations but there is no analysis synthesizing
    the duality of these benefits with related risks in a comprehensive overview.
    There is a need to address the potentially unanticipated impacts of IoT adoption
    (Ma, Wang, & Chu, 2013; Neisse, Baldini, Steri, & Mahieu, 2016) and to investigate
    the impact of IoT adoption on organizations in a systematic manner (Haller, Karnouskos,
    & Schroth, 2009). Little attention has been paid to how IoT adoption may impact
    organizations either with regards to achieving benefits or mitigating unexpected
    risks, leading to unintended consequences, which has led to calls for further
    research in this area (Hsu & Lin, 2018; Lin et al., 2017). The objective of this
    paper is to analyze the impact of IoT on organizations. Without addressing the
    negative aspects as well as the positive we cannot fully describe the impact of
    IoT adoption by organizations. Technology and society are intertwined, and analytical
    efforts to analyze either as a distinct concept are increasingly being questioned
    (Boos, Guenter, Grote, & Kinder, 2013). This dual influence has not yet been recognized
    in studies that attempt to determine whether adoption of IoT has “positive” or
    “negative” (e.g. risks) effects on organizations. In this paper we address the
    need for understanding the impact of IoT adoption throughout the organization
    by taking a structural view and looking at how IoT adoption impacts organizations
    through a duality of technology lens (Orlikowski, 1992). The duality of technology
    integrates the assumption that IoT adoption introduces forces which result in
    certain (positive or negative) impacts and that IoT is adopted due to strategic
    choice and actions (Orlikowski, 1992). In other words, organizations choose to
    adopt IoT due to the benefits that IoT in general is expected to deliver, however,
    achieving these end-state benefits may lead to structural changes which are often
    unexpected. Organizations often underestimate the impact that IoT adoption has
    on the organization, and often do not fully understand the organizational conditions
    and consequences of successfully adopting IoT. Orlikowski’s (1992) concepts allow
    us to recognize that IoT adoption necessarily has both restricting and enabling
    implications for organizations. Which implication dominates may depend on a variety
    of factors, including the autonomy, capability, actions and motives of the actors
    implementing and using IoT, as well as the organizational context within which
    IoT is adopted (Orlikowski, 1992). The central research question is motivated
    by the lack of research on the analysis of IoT adoption in organizations, with
    specific regards to the limited understanding of the benefits and risks of IoT
    adoption in organizations, and asks how IoT adoption may impact organizations?
    We broke the main research question up into four sub-questions, namely: 1 What
    are the benefits of IoT for organizations? 2 What are the risks of IoT for organizations?
    3 What are the organizational conditions of IoT adoption? 4 What are the organizational
    consequences of IoT adoption? The methods used to answer the questions and achieve
    the objective include identifying potential benefits and risks of IoT adoption
    through a literature review and two case studies were analyzed using the multi-method
    approach. The cases selected were both located within a single organization, within
    the context of asset management with regards to large scale, physical infrastructure
    in the Netherlands. The organization under study is the Directorate General of
    Public Works and Water Management of the Netherlands, commonly known within The
    Netherlands as “Rijkswaterstaat” (RWS). RWS is part of the Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure
    and the Environment and is responsible for managing the major road and water networks
    within the Netherlands. The results show that in order to achieve the expected
    benefits, organizations often need to react to unexpected risks which arise during
    the adoption process by making organizational changes. The Duality of Technology
    (Orlikowski, 1992) is used as a theoretical lens to determine relationships and
    reactions during the adoption process. The main contribution of this paper are
    1) the identification of potential benefits and risks of IoT, 2) empirically evaluate
    if the benefits and risks factors identified in the literature also materialize
    in practice, and 3) to analyze in detail how benefits are realized and risks are
    faced in different organizational and domain contexts. The paper reads as follows:
    the literature review deriving a comprehensive list of benefits and risks is presented
    in Section 2; the methodology used in this research is described in Section 3.
    The results of the two case studies are presented in Section 4. The resulting
    benefits of IoT adoption in the cases are presented followed by the risks. The
    results of the cases are discussed in Section 5. Finally, conclusions and recommendations
    for future research are drawn in Section 6. 2. Literature review The literature
    review method proposed by Webster and Watson (2002) was followed to methodologically
    analyze and synthesize quality literature. The goal of the literature review is
    to gain an understanding of the current knowledge base with regards to why and
    how organizations adopt IoT and what risks organizations may face once the adoption
    process has begun. This paper utilizes the Duality of Technology theory (Orlikowski,
    1992) as a practice lens for studying IoT in organizations. We therefore discuss
    literature which helps us understand how IoT adoption structures organizations,
    taking into account research into the adoption and impact of technology on organizations
    as suggested by research on other disrupting technologies such as Electronic Data
    Interchange (EDI) and Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software. In order to
    understand the duality of IoT we look at the expected benefits and risks of IoT.
    Benefits help us understand why organizations choose to adopt IoT whereas understanding
    the risks involved helps us understand the impact of IoT adoption on the organization.
    With regards to adoption of technology, in July 2018 the keywords: “adoption”,
    “technology” and “organizations” returned 23,391 hits in the databases Scopus,
    Web of Science, IEEE Explore and JSTOR. Filtering these results for the domains
    “Technology”, “Policy and Administration” and “Management and Organizational Behavior”
    returned 3585 hits. We selected 52 articles based on the criteria that the articles
    contained a theoretical discussion on adoption models of new technologies regarding
    the structuration of organizations through technology adoption. With regards to
    the benefits and risks of IoT adoption, in July 2018 the keywords: (“Internet
    of Things” OR “IoT”), “benefits”, and “risks” returned 139 hits within the databases
    Scopus, Web of Science, IEEE explore, and JSTOR. We then filtered these results
    and performed a forward and backward search and selected fifty relevant articles
    based on the criteria that they specifically referred to potential benefits or
    risks with regards to the adoption of IoT in organizations. Following Webster
    and Watson (2002), we compiled a matrix of concepts into which the literature
    was grouped (see Table 3). The resulting risks and benefits found in the literature
    were often perceived benefits and risks and it was not clear if they actually
    could be found in practice and how the benefits and risks are interrelated. In
    the literature benefits and risks are often assumed to occur, but there was no
    systematic account of the evaluation in practice and if they were actually accomplished
    and for whom. The following sections are organized as follows: first the adoption
    of technology in relation to duality of technology theory is discussed in Section
    2.1, then the potential benefits of IoT adoption are discussed in Section 2.2
    and finally the potential risks carried by adoption of IoT are discussed in Section
    2.3. 2.1. Adoption of technology in organizations Duality of technology (Orlikowski,
    1992) describes technology as assuming structural properties whilst being the
    product of human action. As such, technology is created by actors in a social
    context, and socially constructed by actors by attaching different meanings to
    it, and thus, technology results from the ongoing interaction of human choices
    and institutional contexts (Orlikowski, 1992). Orlikowski (1992) explains that
    previous research studies in the fields of technology and organizations have focused
    on the views that technology is either an objective, external force that has a
    deterministic impact on organizational properties such as structure, or that human
    action is an aspect of technology whereby technology is an outcome of strategic
    choice and social action. For example, The technology acceptance model (TAM) (Davis,
    Bagozzi, & Warshaw, 1989) is often used for explaining and technology usage, the
    belief being that this behavior is influenced by attitude and intention. However,
    TAM is criticized as being incomplete for considering only part of the attributes
    of the innovation process (Wu & Wu, 2005) and Legris, Ingham, and Collerette (2003)
    suggest that it should be integrated into a broader model which includes social
    change processes. Similarly, (Rogers, 1983) Diffusion of Technology regards technology
    adoption as being a conscious decision to make “full use of an innovation as the
    best course of action available” (Rogers, 2010, p. 177), with diffusion being
    “the process in which an innovation is communicated thorough certain channels
    over time among the members of a social system” (Rogers, 2010, p. 5). Orlikowski
    (1992) suggests that both models are incomplete, and proposes a reconceptualization
    of technology that takes both perspectives into account, proposing a structuration
    model of technology by exploring the relationship between technology and organizations,
    based on Giddens., 1976 Giddens (1976),” Theory of Structuration”. Giddens., 1976
    Giddens (1976)recognizes that “human actions are both enabled and constrained
    by structures, yet that these structures are the results of previous actions”
    (Orlikowski, 1992, p.404). In their structuration model of technology, Orlikowski
    (1992) identifies four main relationships, namely: 1) technology as a product
    of human agency, 2) technology as a medium of human agency, 3) organizational
    conditions of interaction with technology and, 4) organizational consequences
    of interaction with technology. According to Orlikowski (1992), understanding
    technology as continually being socially and physically constructed requires discriminating
    between human activity which affects technology, and human activity which is affected
    by technology (López-Muñoz & Escribá-Esteve, 2017). Orlikowski (1992) identifies
    technology as being the product of human action, while it also assumes structural
    properties. Furthermore, technology is physically constructed by actors working
    in a given social context and socially constructed by actors through the different
    meaning they attach to it. Research in the sociology of technology suggests that
    the evolution of new applications is a process of social interaction between multiple
    agents (Allen, 2003; Kabanda & Brown, 2017). According to Orlikowski (1992), agency
    refers to capability not intentionality, and action taken by actors may have unintended
    consequences. For example, Mirvis, Sales, and Hackett (1991) suggest that technology
    can influence the layers of hierarchy in companies, with regards to delegation
    of responsibilities, or chosen strategy (Buonanno et al., 2005), the suggestion
    being that technology is an important factor driving organizational behavior (Mendel,
    Meredith, Schoenbaum, Sherbourne, & Wells, 2008; Subramanian & Nilakanta, 1996).
    As suggested by Boyne, Gould-Williams, Law, and Walker (2005), the successful
    usage of technology is dependent on constraints which include: 1) the context
    within which public organizations operate (Buonanno et al., 2005; Damanpour &
    Gopalakrishnan, 1998; Damanpour & Schneider, 2006; Quinn & Hall, 1983), 2) the
    characteristics of the organization (Law & Ngai, 2007; Wejnert, 2002), and 3)
    the nature of the technology itself (Peansupap & Walker, 2005). According to Orlikowski
    (1992), technology is interpretively flexible. However interaction of technology
    and organization is a function of the different actors and the socio-historical
    contexts implicated in its development and use. For example, (Law & Ngai, 2007)
    suggest that business processes being a close fit with the defined ERP processes
    are essential for ERP adoption success. 2.2. Expected benefits of IoT adoption
    for organizations The impact of IoT adoption on organizations is primarily related
    to the data which IoT generates. IoT having three aspects “Big”, “Open”, and “Linked”
    (BOLD) (Dwivedi et al., 2017). Firstly, IoT generates large amounts of data which
    is often of better quality than data generated by traditional means, being: 1)
    of higher granularity and often greater accuracy; 2) being of greater heterogeneity,
    coming from a multitude of sources; 3) being more timely than traditional data,
    often being real or near real-time; and 4) having substantially larger volumes.
    As such, IoT data is often referred to as “Big” data, having volume, variety and
    velocity (Kaisler, Armour, Espinosa, & Money, 2013). However, IoT generated Big
    Data also carries associated risks, often related to the management of the data
    and to IT infrastructural limitations. Secondly, the open aspect of IoT means
    that data which is created for one particular use may be used in multiple applications
    to achieve multiple goals, and reveal previously unforeseen insights. However,
    this open aspect can also provide challenges related, for example, to security.
    Thirdly, the linked aspect of IoT allows organizations to combine data from a
    multitude of sources, combining data from “things” with more traditional data.
    However, this linked aspect can also provide challenges related, for example,
    to privacy. In the following sections, the expected benefits of IoT adoption are
    explored, followed by a discussion of the expected risks of IoT adoption. In this
    section we discuss the potential organizational benefits of IoT by addressing
    the three aspects of BOLD. We begin by discussing the improvements and benefits
    of Big Data generated by IoT, then we discuss potential improvements and benefits
    of IoT with regards to the open aspect of IoT, and finally we discuss the potential
    improvements and benefits of IoT with regards to the linked aspect of IoT. 2.2.1.
    Benefits related to big data generated by IoT An important enabling factor for
    IoT adoption is the blended integration of several technologies and communications
    solutions such as identification and tracking technologies, wired and wireless
    sensor and actuator networks, enhanced communication protocols, and distributed
    intelligence for smart objects (Atzori, Iera, & Morabito, 2010), Radio Frequency
    Identification technology, Electronic Product Code technology, and ZigBee technology
    (Chen & Jin, 2012). The heterogeneity of IoT means that, for example, many different
    types of sensors from multiple sources can be used for enabling public safety
    and compliance to regulations for example, potentially providing control mechanisms
    that are more effective than traditional methods (Atzori et al., 2010; Boulos
    & Al-Shorbaji, 2014; Chen & Jin, 2012; Chui, Löffler, & Roberts, 2010; Gubbi,
    Buyya, Marusic, & Palaniswami, 2013). As such, Big Data analytics can play an
    important role in enabling smart governance (Meijer & Bolívar, 2016), aiding collaboration
    between cooperating agencies (Hashem et al., 2016). Chui et al. (2010) suggest
    that timely information from networked things improves decision-making, allow
    for improved analysis with regards to tracking or situational awareness. IoT applications
    not only enable more efficient data gathering but through automation they also
    allow capturing new data with higher granularity about processes and work activities.
    According to Rathore, Ahmad, Paul, and Thikshaja (2016), smart management of the
    traffic system with the provision of real-time information to the citizen based
    on the current traffic situation has a major impact on the citizen life and enhances
    the performance of the Metropolitan authorities. Rathore et al. (2016) also refer
    to the volumes of data that IoT produces, and reducing the standard error of mean
    in data analysis and can result in greater trust in the provided results (Barde
    & Barde, 2012). Kwon, Lee, and Shin (2014) suggest that big data adoption can
    have a major influence on data quality. As such, the improved timeliness and sheer
    volumes of data provided by IoT can enhance the performance of organizations,
    improving operational planning and the ability to react quickly to previously
    unforeseen events. Furthermore, especially in the asset management domain, IoT
    is increasingly being used to monitor the health and quality of organizational
    assets (Kwon, Hodkiewicz, Fan, Shibutani, & Pecht, 2016). 2.2.2. Benefits related
    to the openness of IoT According to Boos et al. (2013), IoT applications are mainly
    seen as allowing automation of data capture thereby making manual intervention
    for data capture unnecessary. IoT provides big data which may be made available
    for open general use (Hashem et al., 2016). Making data and information available
    to the public can improve organizational transparency (Castro, 2008), helping
    improve business processes (Brous, Janssen, & Herder, 2018), and reducing waste.
    Enabling consumer self-service though IoT can empower citizens and business through
    better access to information (Boulos & Al-Shorbaji, 2014; Gubbi et al., 2013).
    Haller et al. (2009) and Fleisch, Sarma, and Subirana (2006) believe that business
    value can be derived from IoT by improving real-world visibility, and business
    process decomposition as IoT enables organizations to monitor what is happening
    in the real world at real-time, increasing service flexibility and service effectiveness,
    allowing better decision making, and often leading to new revenue streams (Bi,
    Da Xu, & Wang, 2014; Haller et al., 2009). Eventually, the capability of IoT to
    inform and automate can subsequently lead to a transformation of existing business
    processes (Boos et al., 2013). 2.2.3. Benefits related to the linked aspect of
    IoT According to Bi et al. (2014) and Fleisch (2010), the linked aspect of IoT
    can reduce labor costs and empower the public by enabling consumer self-service,
    such as self-service check-outs in supermarkets. The resulting collated data can
    then be aggregated leading to insights into product demand, helping supermarkets
    improve the quality of their selection and improve customer satisfaction. Fleisch
    (2010) believes that being able to link data from different sources means that
    IoT can enable fraud detection, reducing fraud related costs and increasing consumer
    trust. Furthermore, the insights gained by the linking of data from various sources
    allows organizations to communicate more effectively with their clients, providing
    new communication opportunities and supporting additional service revenues (Fleisch,
    2010). According to Hashem et al. (2016), effective analysis and utilization of
    big data are important success factors in many business and service domains. This
    involves the capacity of IoT technologies to cost effectively collect data about
    work processes without time consuming physical counts (Boos et al., 2013) so that
    insights from processed data and analysis can be used to improve efficiency, effectiveness
    and compliancy. 2.2.4. Synthesis of potential benefits As suggested above, the
    benefits of IoT technologies for organizations are primarily derived from the
    availability of more granular information which is automatically collected and
    readily shareable soon after it is generated (Harrison, 2011; Vesyropoulos & Georgiadis,
    2013). By way of example, Harrison (2011) suggests that more granular information
    can provide better analysis of track and trace information, and can help balance
    supply and demand. According to Lytras, Mathkour, Abdalla, Yáñez-Márquez, and
    De Pablos (2014), trust in IoT as a reliable receiver and transmitter of critical
    information is important for the realization of more advanced business scenarios.
    Table 1 below summarizes the potential benefits of IoT for organizations. Table
    1. Synthesis of potential benefits of IoT for organizations. BOLD aspect Improvements
    generated by IoT Resulting Organizational Benefits Big Better data quality: higher
    granularity of data which is timely and accessible provides more insights for
    strategic managers Real-time and accurate insights into strategic threats and
    opportunities due to improved forecasting and trend analysis Increased numbers
    and heterogeneity of data sources allow for predictive maintenance and ability
    to combine insight into potential service interruption with available staff, allowing
    organization to better planning with regards to capacity and priority Improved
    planning with regards to management and maintenance Greater volumes of data provide
    insights into potential operational improvements such as reduction of unnecessary
    spending or greater potential for flexible capacity leading to reduced operational
    costs. Reduction of costs due to insights into operational inefficiencies More
    timely data providing real-time information allows organizations to streamline
    services, reducing unnecessary overhead and improving the ability to react timely
    to events Improved speed and efficiency of services due to the provision of real-time
    information Open Greater availability of data allows managers to better inform
    their clients Improved reputation due to better transparency Increased numbers
    of data sources and the ability to combine different data provides insight into
    unexpected activity More efficient enforcement of regulations In-time detection
    of events allows organizations to react more precisely and more accordingly to
    these events, improving the effectiveness of their services Improved effectiveness
    of services due to in-time detection Linked Being able to link data from multiple
    sources allows improved interaction between client and organization, improving
    the ability of clients to make their specific needs known and improving the speed
    with which organizations can react to changing needs and provide bespoke services
    Improved reputation due to higher levels of client empowerment Better oversight
    reduces the need for overly bureaucratic processes, allowing organizations to
    streamline policy and regulations. More efficient regulations due to the ability
    to monitor activities from a distance Linking data from multiple sources provides
    potential for improved interaction with the client and may provide insight into
    previously unknown needs, leading to new product and service lines and new streams
    of revenue New revenue streams due to insights into previously unforeseen product
    and service lines The ability to connect more data, of better quality from new
    sources such as IoT, providing greater insight into (potential) service disruptions,
    which allows organizations to have greater flexibility in their approach to resolution
    of service disruption or the generation of new, bespoke services Improved flexibility
    of services: broader applications due to linking multiple sources In short, IoT
    can deliver a variety of benefits related both to the real-time measurement and
    analyses of sensor data efficiency of services, improved effectiveness of services,
    and improved flexibility of services as to trend analysis of historical data over
    time. 2.3. Risks of IoT adoption for organization In this section we discuss possible
    changes to organizations caused by IoT adoption and the resulting risks that these
    changes bring about using the three aspects of BOLD. 2.3.1. Unexpected risks related
    to big data generated by IoT According to a number of researchers, data leaks
    could severely impact individual privacy by revealing sensitive personal information
    such as personal habits or personal financial information (Fan, Wang, Zhang, &
    Lin, 2014; Hossain & Dwivedi, 2014; Hummen, Henze, Catrein, & Wehrle, 2012; Skarmeta,
    Hernandez-Ramos, & Moreno, 2014). It is therefore important to prevent the unauthorized
    access and misuse of this information whilst allowing necessary and allowed access
    to generated data (Skarmeta et al., 2014). As such, whilst Big Data may provide
    us with the data we need to be able to uncover previously unforeseen insights,
    the duality of IoT can be found in the changes to organizations that are necessary
    to be able to convert Big Data into usable information whilst protecting the rights
    of the individual. Whilst big data is often believed to improve the quality of
    data, the veracity and velocity of big data may make interpretation more difficult
    (Wahyudi, Pekkola, & Janssen, 2018). The duality of IoT also means that changes
    occurring in staff and organizational processes can in turn lead to further changes
    to the IT infrastructure as staff become more aware of the possibilities of Big
    Data and as new requirements become available. According to Dwivedi et al. (2017),
    there is not one proven or best infrastructure, and data quality is often unclear
    and needs to be investigated (Wahyudi et al., 2018). As such, unforeseen risks
    may also include technical issues such as limitations in information technology
    (IT) infrastructural capabilities (Fan et al., 2014; Hummen et al., 2012; Kranenburg
    et al., 2014; Prasad et al., 2011; Scarfo, 2014; Wiechert, Thiesse, Michahelles,
    Schmitt, & Fleisch, 2007; Yazici, 2014; Zeng, Guo, & Cheng, 2011), and data management
    (Blackstock & Lea, 2012; Gilman & Nordtvedt, 2014; Stephan et al., 2013). Dealing
    with these risks often cause unforeseen costs, (Reyes, Li, & Visich, 2012) including
    reduced return on investment (Brous & Janssen, 2015a; Brous, Janssen, Schraven,
    Spiegeler, & Duzgun, 2017). High costs should be considered an important risk
    to the adoption of IoT (Fan et al., 2014; Harris, Wang, & Wang, 2015; Nam & Pardo,
    2014; Qiao & Wang, 2012; Yazici, 2014), as the costs of realizing a fully functional
    IoT system can be substantial. 2.3.2. Unexpected risks related to the openness
    of IoT As discussed above, an important enabler of IoT is to permit others to
    access and use the things that have been published publicly on the Internet and
    many believe that should be possible for users to make use of things that others
    have shared and to make use of things in their own applications, perhaps in ways
    unanticipated by the owner of the thing (Blackstock & Lea, 2012). According to
    Zuiderwijk and Janssen (2014), much of the existing research regarding the “openness”
    of data has oriented towards data provision. However, the duality of the openness
    of IoT means that a mature set of mechanisms is required to publish and share
    things as well as ensure that they are findable and accessible (Blackstock & Lea,
    2012). For example, Qian and Che (2012) describe search locality, scalability
    and real-time processing as strong barriers to IoT implementation. According to
    Qian and Che (2012), existing searching techniques are based on remote information
    sharing and often fail to effectively support local search of physical objects.
    The duality of continuously monitoring a wide range of things within a variety
    of situations, means that there are several technological and regulatory challenges
    that need to be addressed. Often cited technical and regulatory challenges are
    related to data ownership (Hossain & Dwivedi, 2014), security, and sharing of
    information (Scarfo, 2014). However, new security issues are increasingly becoming
    evident (Ortiz, Lazaro, Uriarte, & Carnerero, 2013), and there are few convincing
    solutions for providing fine grained access control for IoT applications (Brous
    & Janssen, 2015a; Brous et al., 2017), especially when sensitive data is involved
    (Fan et al., 2014; Harris et al., 2015; Hummen et al., 2012). 2.3.3. Unexpected
    risks related to the linked aspect of IoT According to Zeng et al. (2011) it is
    not uncommon for IoT systems to be both directly and indirectly integrated with
    existing applications, as, for example, RFIDs are often indirectly integrated
    through a RFID reader and directly integrated through an embedded server. IoT
    technology can be highly heterogeneous in terms of protocols and capabilities,
    etc. Whilst we have seen that some researchers argue the benefits of data heterogeneity,
    the duality is that the heterogeneity at the device level can also be a serious
    impediment to IoT adoption due to interoperability issues (Shadbolt et al., 2012;
    Zeng et al., 2011). Furthermore, consumers of data are often also heterogeneous
    (Brous & Janssen, 2015a; Brous et al., 2017), and different applications might
    employ different methods of data processing. According to Zeng et al. (2011) the
    heterogeneity of IoT makes the design of IoT architectures very challenging. This
    is underlined by Qian and Che (2012) as they determine that searching in IoT requires
    a methodology of architecture design of search engines as designing an appropriate
    search engine for IoT is non-trivial. This can mean that although linking IoT
    data can provide benefits (Brous & Janssen, 2015b), a lack of policies and implementation
    guidelines can also greatly impede the adoption of IoT (Shadbolt et al., 2012).
    Adoption of IoT introduces the need for new skills, staff to provide these skills
    and new organizational forms and processes (Brous et al., 2018). For example,
    finding and employing qualiﬁed personnel can present enormous challenges due to
    shortages of skilled staff (Speed & Shingleton, 2012; Yazici, 2014), as well as
    limited training and educational options (Harris et al., 2015). Many researchers
    also suggest that a reluctance to change or to learn new technologies can be prevalent
    in many organizations (Pedro & Jaska, 2007; Reyes et al., 2012; Speed & Shingleton,
    2012; Yazici, 2014). 2.3.4. Synthesis of risks People must be willing to take
    part in the system as, according to Kranenburg et al. (2014), successful IoT implementations
    often depend on people participating and sharing information (Fan et al., 2014;
    Nam & Pardo, 2014; Zeng et al., 2011). Kranenburg et al. (2014) believe that trust
    and conﬁdence in IoT and the perceived value that the IoT creates is of great
    importance. The more trust and confidence users have in the system, the more willing
    they will be to participate. Conversely, the less trust in the system, the less
    people will be willing to participate (Brous et al., 2017). As such, the duality
    of IoT suggests that organizations need to position themselves carefully within
    this arena (Harris et al., 2015; Stephan et al., 2013; Yazici, 2014) and should
    consider the role they play in enabling IoT development. For example, trust related
    conflicting market forces can play substantial roles in the success or failure
    of IoT (Fan et al., 2014; Misuraca, 2009; Qiao & Wang, 2012; Wiechert et al.,
    2007). Table 2 below synthesizes the potential risks generated by IoT adoption
    in organizations. Table 2. Synthesis of potential risks generated by IoT adoption
    in organizations. BOLD aspect Unexpected Changes Caused by IoT Adoption Resulting
    Organizational Risks Big Changes to laws and public opinion means that organizations
    need to be aware of potential disclosure of individual data which could reveal
    sensitive information such as personal habits or personal financial information.
    Data privacy conflicts resulting in reputational damage and possible legal action.
    Changes in accuracy of data on which decisions are made. High development and
    implementation costs are important impediments to the implementation and application
    of IoT often results in unforeseen expenditure. High implementation costs can
    result in unexpected, added pressure on tight budgets. Limitations in information
    technology (IT) infrastructural capabilities and data management with regards
    to increasing volumes and speeds of data delivery mean that structural changes
    to the IT infrastructure of organizations are often required. Difficult interoperability
    and integration mean that architecture, energy efficiency, security, protocols
    and quality of service can be affected by IoT adoption. Open Technological and
    regulatory challenges regarding data sharing and data protection often need to
    be addressed during IoT adoption. Data security breaches and data leaks leading
    to reputational damage, potential loss of intellectual property and lost production.
    Sophisticated mechanisms to publish and share things and ways to find and access
    those things often need to be developed. The need for solutions for providing
    fine grained access control need to be developed restricts organizations in their
    ability to share data responsibly with the right people at the right time. A lack
    of standard IoT architectures and missing chains in IoT research and development
    means that organizations often need to develop their own architectures and technologies
    which, in turn can impact the market Conflicting market forces of supply and demand
    mean that organizations often need to develop their own research and development
    regarding IoT, often in cases where IoT is not their core business. However, a
    lack of sufficient knowledge regarding IoT can inhibit this development. Linked
    Policies and regulations regarding IoT and the linking of data and things often
    need to be developed. Lack of sufficient legal frameworks mean that organizations
    are often exposed to either over-linkage leading to security or privacy issues,
    or take unnecessary steps to prevent linkage, reducing the level of benefits.
    A lack of acceptance of IoT means that organizations often need to develop trust
    in the new systems. The greater the trust of users in the IoT, the greater their
    conﬁdence in the system and the more willing they will be to participate. Lack
    of trust in IoT means that implemented systems are often not fully exploited resulting
    in a reduction of benefits. The heterogeneity traits of the overall IoT system
    make the design of a unifying framework and the communication protocols a very
    challenging task, especially with devices with different levels of capabilities.
    Linking heterogeneous data from heterogeneous data sources can create data quality
    issues resulting in misleading information. In short, IoT faces a variety of risks
    related to the proper use, such as privacy and security, for example, as well
    as proper management of the data collected by the vast number of interconnected
    things. 2.4. Organizational conditions of IoT adoption Damanpour and Gopalakrishnan
    (1998) believe that due to the stability of the environments in which they occur,
    many organizations with low adoption rates have, in the past, tended to have a
    hierarchical or mechanistic organizational form, meaning that these organizations
    will adopt innovations infrequently. According to Damanpour and Gopalakrishnan
    (1998), because of the stable environments surrounding many public organizations,
    organizational change usually entails modifications to business processes and
    IT systems, forcing innovations to be incremental and to be designed to reuse
    existing systems in different configurations rather than to create new ones. Herder,
    de Joode, Ligtvoet, Schenk, and Taneja (2011) believe that organizations within
    the public sector need to be predictable and transparent. This may create a hesitation
    to apply new methods as witnessed by the resistance of asset managers to trust
    data driven insights. According to Damanpour and Gopalakrishnan (1998), organizational
    forms that are most effective in adopting innovations include the organic and
    adhocracy organizational forms (Quinn & Hall, 1983). This demonstrates a more
    organic structure in which the organization is designed to be a more creative
    environment with an emphasis on trust. Trust is identified as being critical to
    acceptance of IoT in organizations (Brous et al., 2017). Psychological resistance
    to IoT can have a strong negative influence on the acceptance of IoT by asset
    managers. Asset managers therefore need to be able to trust the system in order
    to have the confidence to make correct decisions at the right time based on secure
    and correct data. However, the case studies also show that asset managers often
    have an inherent distrust of systems over which they have little understanding
    and control (Backer, Liberman, & Kuehnel, 1986). Furthermore, research in data
    governance (Brous, Janssen, & Vilminko-Heikkinen, 2016) has shown that a formalized
    data governance structure which is a fit with the specific organization, does
    need to be implemented in order to enable IoT adoption in asset management organizations.
    This is because automating decision-making often incurs business process related
    changes which can be found in aligning complex data structures. For example, decision
    making can be performed at a more strategic, regional level as opposed to at the
    local, operational level. It is important to ensure that data provenance is well
    organized so that it is clear where responsibilities and accountabilities lie
    throughout the data lifecycle (Brous et al., 2017). This may create tension in
    the organization due to a principle agent problem as suggested by Herder et al.
    (2011) in which the one who pays is not always the one who decides and is often
    not the one who benefits from the investment. It is therefore important that data
    provenance is organized in such a way that inter-departmental teams are aware
    of the goals behind IoT adoption so that they understand why certain activities
    need to be performed that may not necessarily have a direct influence on their
    part of the process. For example, when business processes become automated, people
    assume new or different roles and people-made decisions are often elevated to
    more strategical levels. This also often means changes in the organization as
    people are asked to perform other tasks in changing social and cultural environments
    and often in changing organizational structures (Damanpour & Schneider, 2006;
    Mitropoulos & Tatum, 1999; Skogstad & Einarsen, 1999). As such, with regards to
    organizational related changes brought about by IoT adoption and in agreement
    with Weber et al. (2009) there is no “one-size-fits-all” approach to data governance.
    Environmental characteristics may refer to the sector within which the organization
    operates, or may represent cultural, societal, political or geographical conditions
    (Wejnert, 2002). According to Herder et al. (2011), settings resemble non-competitive,
    monopolistic environments should result in less incentive for organizations to
    quickly absorb best practices than would be expected in a competitive setting.
    However, as suggested by Aarons, Hurlburt, and Horwitz (2011), external policy
    and regulation may be positively associated with adoption of new technologies,
    including specific enactment of policies, legislation, or regulations on innovation
    adoption. 2.5. Organizational consequences of IoT adoption in organizations According
    to Orlikowski (1992), understanding technology as continually being socially and
    physically constructed requires discriminating between human activity which affects
    technology, and human activity which is affected by technology (López-Muñoz &
    Escribá-Esteve, 2017). Orlikowski (1992) identifies technology as being the product
    of human action, while it also assumes structural properties. Furthermore, technology
    is physically constructed by actors working in a given social context and socially
    constructed by actors through the different meaning they attach to it. Research
    in the sociology of technology suggests that the evolution of new applications
    is a process of social interaction between multiple agents (Allen, 2003; Kabanda
    & Brown, 2017). According to Orlikowski (1992), agency refers to capability not
    intentionality, and action taken by actors may have unintended consequences. For
    example, Mirvis et al. (1991) suggest that technology can influence the layers
    of hierarchy in companies, with regards to delegation of responsibilities, or
    chosen strategy (Buonanno et al., 2005), the suggestion being that technology
    is an important factor driving organizational behavior (Mendel et al., 2008; Subramanian
    & Nilakanta, 1996). As suggested by Boyne et al. (2005), the successful usage
    of technology is dependent on constraints which include: 1) the context within
    which public organizations operate (Buonanno et al., 2005; Damanpour & Gopalakrishnan,
    1998; Damanpour & Schneider, 2006; Quinn & Hall, 1983), 2) the characteristics
    of the organization (Law & Ngai, 2007; Wejnert, 2002), and 3) the nature of the
    technology itself (Peansupap & Walker, 2005). According to Orlikowski (1992),
    technology is interpretively flexible. However interaction of technology and organization
    is a function of the different actors and the socio-historical contexts implicated
    in its development and use. For example, (Law & Ngai, 2007) suggest that business
    processes being a close fit with the defined ERP processes are essential for ERP
    adoption success. According to Brous et al. (2018), organizational consequences
    of IoT adoption include significant changes to business processes within the organization
    although automating business processes remains challenging (Mihailovic, 2016).
    As suggested by Herder et al. (2011), most organizations include a variety of
    actors and stakeholders and this multi-agent setting complicates the implementation
    of innovation as decision-making may often involve a long process which could
    involve political trade-offs and stakeholder consultations. As such, people related
    changes wrought about by IoT adoption in organizations may be seen in the way
    people themselves have to adapt to new technologies as suggested by Solomons and
    Spross (2011). In line with Solomons and Spross (2011), when there is no attention
    to the cultural dimension of asset management through IoT, improvement results
    are not acknowledged by the organization, success is not rewarded and improvement
    behaviors do not become embedded in practice. This suggests that the ability of
    tactical staff to observe meaningful results and achieve expected benefits is
    important to implementing and sustaining IoT adoption as suggested by Feldstein
    & Glasgow (2008). 3. Methodology The paper uses case study research investigated
    using a multi-method approach to examine IoT adoption in organizations. According
    to Choudrie and Dwivedi (2005), case study is a widely chosen method for examining
    technology adoption issues. The research design follows the case study methodology
    proposed by Yin (2003). The design of case study research includes the research
    questions, the propositions for research, the unit of analysis, the logic which
    links the data to the propositions and the criteria for interpreting the findings
    (Yin, 2003). A background of relevant literature was developed in which the research
    was placed in context, and the expected benefits and risks that IoT adoption may
    bring were identified from previous research. The case study method was employed
    to examine how IoT adoption in real life settings have impacted organizations.
    Case study research was chosen as the main research method in order to exam the
    effects of IoT adoption in a real-world context (Eisenhardt, 1989; Yin, 2003).
    According to Eisenhardt (1989), a broad definition of the research question is
    important in building theory from case studies. As discussed above, this research
    asks how IoT adoption may impact organizations. IoT has much potential, however,
    the full impact of IoT adoption on organizations has not yet been investigated
    systematically and remains largely anecdotal. This article relies on the concepts
    of duality of technology (Orlikowski, 1992) to derive preliminary propositions,
    assuming that organizations initiate IoT adoption in order to achieve expected
    benefits, but that these benefits often introduce unexpected risks which require
    mitigation as seen below in Fig. 1. Download : Download high-res image (57KB)
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. The conceptualization of the relationship
    between expected benefits of IoT for the organization, encountered risks in practice
    and organizational (institutional) conditions and consequences. Duality of technology
    suggests that IoT adoption comprises decisions on a technical level, but these
    decisions cannot be isolated from organizational aspects. The unit of analysis,
    the organization, sets the boundaries for the case with regard to generalizability
    of its results. Duality of technology is also used as the logic which links the
    data to the propositions in the case analysis and serves as guidance for the interpretation
    of findings. The duality of technology lens was used in the following way: 1)
    viewing IoT as a product of human action, the IoT system and its development was
    described and expected benefits of the cases were listed; 2) viewing IoT as a
    medium of human action, the uses and constraints of the system were analyzed and
    described; 3) looking at the institutional conditions of interaction with IoT,
    the human and organizational changes which were deemed necessary to be able to
    use and manage the system were listed and analyzed; 4) looking at the institutional
    consequences of interaction with IoT, the actions which were taken to mitigate
    the experienced risks and achieve expected benefits were listed and analyzed.
    Derived from Orlikowski (1992), Table 3 below shows the propositions related to
    the types of influence of technology as suggested by Duality of Technology. Table
    3. Propositions of the influence of IoT. No. Type of Influence (Orlikowski, 1992)
    Proposition (this research) 1. Technology as a product of human action IoT is
    developed and implemented in order to achieve expected benefits 2. Technology
    as a medium of human action IoT can facilitate human action, but also poses significant
    risks to organizations such that expected benefits are often not achieved 3. Institutional
    conditions of interaction with technology Achieving benefits of IoT adoption requires
    new skills, roles and processes 4. Institutional consequences of interaction with
    technology Mitigating the risks of IoT adoption often requires structural changes
    to the organization Following Ketokivi and Choi (2014), induction type reasoning
    was used in order to look for both similarities and differences across the cases
    and proceed toward theoretical generalizations. As with other multiple case study
    research (Otto, 2011; Pagell & Wu, 2009), the data analysis in this research contained
    both within and across case analysis (Miles & Huberman, 1994). Within case analysis
    helps us to examine the impact of IoT on organizations in a single context, while
    the across case analysis triangulates the constructs of interest between the cases.
    The paper describes how one organization approaches the issue of IoT adoption
    in different domains, namely water management and road management. Along with
    a clear understanding of the unit of analysis, case selection is crucial for building
    theory from case studies because it is case selection that determines the external
    validity of the case study and the limits for generalizing the findings (Yin,
    2003). The cases selected were both located within RWS, within the context of
    asset management with regards to large scale, physical infrastructure in the Netherlands.
    The cases under study were selected from two different domains within RWS in order
    to ensure diversity and external validity through replication logic (Eisenhardt,
    1989; Yin, 2003), in which each case serves as a distinct experiment that stands
    on its own as an analytic unit. The two cases of IoT adoption that were chosen
    were the automatic measurement of the weight of vehicles over the Dutch National
    Highways, “Weigh-In-Motion” (WIM), and the automatic measurement of hydrological
    data in Dutch Waters, “Landelijk Meetnet Water”, (LMW). These are both mission
    critical systems for RWS. Table 4 below presents an overview of the cases chosen.
    Table 4. Case studies overview. Attribute Case 1 Case 2 Organization RWS RWS Name
    Weigh-In-Motion Landelijk Meetnet Water Domain Road Management Water Management
    Number of Measuring Stations 18 640 The case study was conducted using a multi-method
    approach. In order to prepare the organization for the case study research project,
    RWS was provided with information material outlining the objectives of the project.
    Following the suggestions of Yin (2003), the research design is a multimethod
    design and multiple data sources were used. Primary data sources included the
    use of individual interviews and group discussions. Secondary data sources included
    relevant market research and policy documents as well as websites. The cases were
    investigated over a period of eighteen months. At the start of the research, in
    June 2015, group discussions were held with personnel directly involved in the
    implementation project or who were tasked with managing and maintain the systems.
    Special focus was given to discovering expected and experienced benefits as well
    as foreseen risks. The group discussions helped to give a broad view of the case
    study from a formal, organizational perspective. This perspective was complemented
    by the findings from the secondary data. After eighteen months, individuals were
    then approached to gain insights into how the adoption process had proceeded and
    to gain personalized views as to the experienced impact of the adoption cases.
    Although our unit of analysis is the organization, by interviewing persons within
    the cases it helped to better understand and capture the underexposed and unexpected
    benefits and risks which may not have been revealed in a group setting due to
    the desire to maintain group or individual reputations. To address the construct
    validity of the case studies as suggested by Yin (2003), the researchers requested
    and were given unrestricted access to subject matter experts and internal documentation.
    Interviewees were selected on the basis that they were intimately involved in
    the project as early adopters. Interviewees were selected from three levels in
    the organization, namely the strategic, tactical and operational. The questions
    in the interviews were structured into two groups. First the need for IoT adoption
    and the expected benefits, and second, the risks and how these were mitigated.
    The cases were investigated over a period of eighteen months. In January 2017,
    individual interviews were held with RWS personnel to identify unexpected risks
    which had been experienced during the implementation process. A challenge faced
    by the research, and also an identified risk to the adoption process, was the
    staff changes during the adoption process. In this research we mitigated the risk
    faced by interviewing different people by interviewing staff in the second round
    with similar roles to those interviewed in the first round. However, it is possible
    that different answers may have been given if the same people had been interviewed
    in both rounds. Internal documentation was selected which dealt specifically with
    the intended benefits or risks and issues faced by the adopting projects. Table
    5 below summarizes the data sources used. All interviews were documented in writing.
    The documents were then analyzed and transferred into an integrated case document
    (one for each case). The first versions of this document were then sent to the
    interview participants for feedback and clarification of open points. Once all
    the additional information feedback had been incorporated, the final version was
    reviewed and discussed with the main contacts at RWS. Table 5. Data sources. Name

    the cases was made by listing benefits and risks found in internal documentation
    and comparing these to the benefits and risks exposed in the interviews. There
    were several iterations throughout the research as each case introduced new benefits
    and risks. 4. Findings Using the Duality of Technology as lens we analyzed whether
    or not assumed benefits were confirmed in practice and whether other unexpected
    benefits or risks were experienced. The case studies were considered necessary
    in order to consider and include possible future consequences that go beyond the
    intended as suggested by the duality of technology. The case study research involved
    the use of multiple methods for collecting data. 4.1. Case study 1: weigh-in-motion
    At present, RWS estimates that at least 15 percent of freight traffic on the Dutch
    national road network is overloaded. Overloading of heavy vehicles causes road
    pavement structural distress and a reduced service lifetime (Bagui, Das, & Bapanapalli,
    2013; Mulyun, Parikesit, Antameng, & Rahim, 2010). Effectively reducing overloading
    reduces the damage to the road infrastructure, lengthening the road’s lifetime
    and reduces the frequency of maintenance. The damage to pavements and installations
    by overloaded trucks in 2008 was estimated to be at least 34 million euros per
    year (Brous et al., 2017). The ambition of RWS is to increase the operational
    efficiency and effectiveness of the approach to overloading and thus reduce maintenance
    costs. Traditional enforcement of laws and regulations regarding overloading involved
    the use of physical measuring stations. This included manual checks by the police
    in which many vehicles were selected where overloading was suspected but uncertain.
    This often led to unnecessary inconvenience to citizens as vehicles were often
    stopped unnecessarily. Until 2010, The Netherlands had 5 measuring stations nationwide.
    It was suspected that many carriers were able to avoid these stations by choosing
    alternative routes whilst retaining their economic gain. RWS has created a national
    network of monitoring points, the “Weigh in Motion” (WIM) network with the goal
    of improving the operational efficiency and effectiveness of monitoring services
    and improve the tactical efficiency and effectiveness of enforcement of regulations.
    The WIM system is one of the most advanced measurement systems in the world. In
    the period 2010–2013, RWS built a nationwide network of WIM stations, a total
    of 22 measuring stations. In addition to sensitive sensors, cameras are also are
    part of the WIM systems. The WIM network, consisting of measuring stations in
    the road on which the axle loads of heavy traffic is weighed, is used to support
    the enforcement of overloading by helping the enforcement agency to select overloaded
    trucks for weighing in a static location. Data on overloaded vehicles on the road
    are automatically sent from WIM to the Real Time Monitor (RTM) web application
    which processes, stores and publishes the data of all weigh points. The Inspectorate
    for the Living Environment and Transport (ILT) is then able to perform supervision
    and enforcement actions on overloaded vehicles in near-real time, improving the
    overall flexibility of the services as ILT and RWS are able to decide where and
    when offenders are controlled. The network provides access to information about
    the actual load of the main road, and about peak times when it comes to overloading.
    This provides RWS and ILT with the ability to collect information concerning the
    compliance behavior of individual carriers as, in addition to sensors, cameras
    are also are part of the WIM systems. Via camera footage, the ILT can identify
    the license plates of vehicles that are overloaded and therefore the detect owner
    and / or licensee and address. The strategy being to tackle overloading by integrating
    roadside enforcement along with targeting carriers according to behavior based
    on the information from the system. 4.2. Case study 2: hydrological data collection
    RWS operates and maintains the National Water Measurement Network, at RWS known
    as “Landelijk Meetnet Water” (LMW). This is a facility that is responsible for
    the acquisition, storage and distribution of data for water resources. LMW has
    approximately 640 data collection points using a nationwide system of sensors.
    The data is then processed and stored in the data center and is made available
    to a variety of systems and users. The LMW was created from the merging of three
    previous existing monitoring networks: the Water Monitoring Network, which monitors
    inland waterways such as canals and rivers; the Monitoring Network North, which
    monitors North Sea oil platforms and channels; and the Zeeland Tidal Waters Monitoring
    Network which monitors the Zeeland delta waterways. LMW also includes data from
    third parties, including water data from foreign countries and other public organizations
    within The Netherlands. LMW enables timely data with regards to the situation
    in rivers, canals and sea via sensors at approximately 640 monitoring sites. Monitoring
    sites are managed and administrated partly by RWS (approximately 300 physical
    measurement locations) but also partly by external parties (approximately 340
    monitoring stations). The locations measured include hydrological and meteorological
    data. Conditions at the different measuring stations can be location specific.
    RWS has standardized the method of converting raw sensor signals to metrics, including
    validations and conversion calculations. This is an internal RWS standard. Meteorological
    data are collected in close collaboration with the Royal Netherlands Meteorological
    Institute (KNMI). Hydrological data concerning the measurement of water levels,
    flow rate (average amount of water in m3/s), wave height and direction, velocity
    and direction and temperature. Also, in some locations water quality is measured
    in order to assess whether the water meets the norms of the European Union Water
    Framework Directive. Meteorological data concerning the measurement of wind speed
    and direction, air temperature and humidity, visibility, air pressure and cloud
    base is also collected. The LMW processes sensor information and upgrades this
    data to qualified readings. 4.3. Cross-case comparison This section presents the
    results of the cross-case comparison, presenting the results of the case studies
    using a Duality of Technology (Orlikowski, 1992) lens to present the data. Tables
    6 to 8 below present the results of the case studies for big, open and linked
    aspects of IoT respectively. In each table the first column states the case to
    which the description relates. The second column describes the expected benefit
    to be gained from the case. The third column describes the risks which were encountered
    whilst attempting to gain the described benefit. The fourth column describes the

    Encountered Risk(s) Institutional condition(s) Institutional consequence(s) WIM
    WIM generates large amounts of data which is processed near to real time so that
    inspectors are able to quickly identify trucks for roadside inspection without
    unnecessarily disrupting traffic. Uncertain data quality prevented trust in the
    results Ensuring data quality required implementation of a Data Quality Framework
    to manage data: new skills, roles and processes required to manage data quality
    Ensuring data quality resulted in structural changes to data management departments:
    new staff, new departments Configuration complexities of the system: -IoT technologies
    were adjusted to accommodate unexpected real world situations -new specialized
    equipment need to be developed The configuration needed to be closely monitored:
    new specialized skills required New responsibilities to monitor configurations
    regularly meant new dedicated teams IT infrastructure limitations: -expansion
    of servers - expansion of network Mitigating limitations required expansion of
    existing IT infrastructure: -new specialized skills required Expanding IT meant
    new, dedicated operational teams and extra staff to manage systems As WIM needed
    to be developed from concept, the market was encouraged to develop new products
    and create new business opportunities. Framework agreements were insufficient
    as RWS also needed to work with small start-ups Because RWS worked with framework
    agreements with established partners, RWS needed to rethink their approach to
    framework agreements to accommodate start-ups and smaller parties. New knowledge
    regarding procurement policies were developed Structural changes to procurement
    policies and processes were required to accommodate partnerships with start-ups
    and smaller parties. LMW Due to the timeliness and volume of data, LMW makes it
    possible to automate processes based on accepted norms and using well tested models,
    greatly reducing the time required to act in emergency situations. Uncertain data
    quality prevented trust in the results Ensuring data quality meant that sensors
    needed to be regularly checked and cleaned by hand. Checking and cleaning sensors
    meant new roles and responsibilities for maintaining sensors and new teams required
    to manage sensors (outsourced on managed internally) Configuration complexities
    of the system: -expansion of servers -expansion of network The configuration needed
    to be closely monitored: – new specialized skills required New responsibilities
    to monitor configurations regularly 4.3.1. Big data aspects of IoT The main big
    data benefits of both case studies are related to amount of data as well as the
    speed with which it can be collected and analyzed. Both cases rely on (near) real-time
    data to be able to make operational decisions. LMW relies on a large variety of
    data in order to be able to predict water levels in time for storm-surge barriers
    to be able to close whilst WIM is required to identify freight trucks, measure
    their weights and transmit this to inspectors at near real-time. Achieving these
    benefits required a good deal of innovation and in both case studies, interviewees
    questioned whether or not the reliability of the data was sufficiently well equipped
    whilst some interviewees raised questions about the accuracy and reliability of
    the data. For example, in the WIM case one official suggested that at the start
    of the project, “the quality of the data needed to be quantified, and solving
    data quality issues was incident driven”. The reason for this is that the WIM
    system is able to differentiate between the vehicle and the load, but not all
    vehicles weigh the same. Not all number plates are placed in the same place on
    the vehicle, and not all drivers have the same driving style. Real world complexities
    meant that the system had to “learn” about the different real world possibilities.
    This was similar to the LMW case in which RWS officials initially could not completely
    trust the system due to fluctuations in data quality. This is because measurements
    of sensors can be polluted (due to algae growth, etc.) so that the signal weakens
    and reduces the quality of the measurement. Pollution of the measurement is (amongst
    other things) dependent on the temperature, light (the season), and the type of
    water (salt or fresh). The belief exists that the risks involved in completely
    trusting the LMW system to automate operations are often too great to allow complete
    automation due to the economic impact of closing storm surge barriers. If LMW
    distributes incorrect data due to either mechanical or human defects, the system
    may erroneously indicate that the storm surge barriers should close when this
    is not necessary, or worse, that the surge barriers should not close when it is
    necessary. Closing a storm surge barrier unnecessarily can have enormous economic
    impact as shipping is unable to offload goods according to schedule. In both case
    studies, interviewees also cited several technological challenges which needed
    to be overcome, and which no single market partner could supply at the time. For
    example, in both cases, data could not initially be transported and stored with
    acceptable performance. The development of the system also meant that only few
    private organizations were capable of implementing WIM. This meant that if RWS
    would provide innovation opportunities to a single party, this would have provided
    that party with an unfair market advantage. Interviewees explained that it became
    important to develop a procurement strategy with regards to IoT adoption. In Table
    6 below the results of the case studies as related to specifically Big Data aspects
    of IoT are presented. 4.3.2. Openness aspects of IoT In the WIM case, opening
    the data for public use presented unique challenges with regards to privacy as
    any and all data related to individuals needed to be strictly anonymized before
    any of the data could be shared publicly. In the LMW case, privacy was not considered
    to be an issue as the data collected was strictly water and weather related data
    and not related to any persons. However, both cases did reveal that data integrity
    and therefore security was an issue with regards to open data, as although the
    data could be shared, opening the data meant that steps needed to be taken to
    ensure that it was not possible in any way for data to be tampered with or manipulated.
    With regards to WIM, for example, it must not be possible in any way to tamper
    with the “evidence” provided by the data. The interviewees believe that as an
    instrument to help roadside enforcement WIM works well, but there are difficulties
    in using WIM to legally prove offence. The Dutch legal system does not yet fully
    trust WIM to provide legally conclusive evidence with regards to overloading.
    It is not yet possible to entirely automate the enforcement process, as physical
    testing is still required to legally prove overloading. With regards to LMW, the
    economic impact of incorrectly interpreted data is such that data integrity needs
    to be ensured throughout the system. Another issue surrounding the openness of
    the data is determining responsibilities and who bears the costs. Initially, RWS
    has born the majority of the costs for both LWM and WIM, despite providing the
    data free of charge to all other parties as “open data”. According to an RWS official,
    “because of the number of measuring stations and the geographic spread of the
    sensors, implementation and maintenance of the sensor network is a costly affair”.
    However, economic benefits have risen from opening the data, although not directly
    for RWS as businesses are able to provide new services using data created by the
    LMW network such as developing new models which are used in planning and maintenance
    or to provide services for the maintenance and management of the LMW sensors.
    Table 7 below presents the results of the case studies as related to the openness
    aspects of IoT. Table 7. Cross-case comparison: duality of openness aspects of
    IoT. Case Expected Benefit(s) Encountered Risk(s) Institutional condition(s) Institutional
    consequence(s) WIM Analysis of the stored measurement data shows patterns, improving
    forecasting and trend analysis. There is obviously something wrong with vehicles
    that are frequently flagged in the system. That may be reason to perform roadside
    inspections in a subsequent inspection or to visit the parent company for an inspection.
    Data privacy: making the data publicly available required ensuring privacy as
    images of car number plates are made by the system. Additional data management
    processes were required to blur images and ensure that identifying attributes
    were removed A new dedicated team was required to manage data and ensure that
    contractors delivered data as required. Data integrity: it was vitally important
    that the data represented the actual situation and could not be manipulated by
    the system or unauthorized persons Additional data management processes were required
    to ensure data integrity Procedures and extra security measures were required
    due to the need to prove offence. Data Governance: as the data was used by multiple
    organizations, it was important to define ownership and responsibilities with
    regards to cost and accountability Governance processes and acceptance of accountability
    needed to be defined and accepted Internal and external negotiations between stakeholders
    needed to be held in order to define accepted responsibilities LMW The centralized
    gathering of data has greatly reduced the overall cost of data collection as a
    whole, as the data is collected only once by one source and shared between partners,
    Data integrity: due to the multiple technologies, interoperability and data integrity
    needed to be guaranteed. Action need to be taken to ensure that the data could
    not be manipulated by the system or unauthorized persons Additional data integrity
    checks through the flow of data needed to be defined and implemented Imbalance
    between cost and benefit for RWS. Data Governance: RWS bears the brunt of the
    cost despite that the data is used by multiple organizations RWS needed to accept
    responsibility for the total cost of ownership Imbalance between cost and benefit
    for RWS. 4.3.3. Linked aspects of IoT One of the initial challenges of both of
    the cases was the definition of the service and the identification of possible
    solutions. In both cases, initial proof of concepts used a combination of intermediate
    products to approximate the final solution. Innovation was required in order to
    be able to ensure the necessary precision of the data. For example, the ability
    to detect overloaded trucks is based on data and it is possible to ensure owners
    of the carriers and load are also identified and thus enforce regulations at source.
    According to a RWS Director, “in order to effectively manage the technology, it
    is important to have sufficient mandate to manage the entire chain”. Managing
    only the technology or parts of the system produces inefficiencies and can disrupt
    other processes, such as traffic management, if the overview of the system is
    not taken into account when planning maintenance. Outsourcing to external contractors
    meant that extra processes needed to be developed to be able to coordinate with
    other primary processes. The LMW provides a complete technical infrastructure
    for the gathering and distribution of water data and delivers the data to various
    stakeholders within and outside RWS such as the Storm Surge Barriers, hydro-meteorological
    centers, municipal port companies (among others Port of Rotterdam), flood early
    warning services and other private parties. As such, LWM has greatly improved
    the efficiency, effectiveness and flexibility of a wide variety of public services,
    as the gathering of this data is centralized and each service and party no longer
    has to gather the data themselves. However, there are various aspects that determine
    the limit of the life span of a measuring station such as availability of components,
    a dependable producer of components, the number of suppliers with similar components,
    life expectancy of the components, and maintainability of the software. Table
    8 below presents the results of the case studies as related to specifically linked
    data aspects of IoT. Table 8. Cross-case comparison: duality of linked aspects
    of IoT. Case Expected Benefit(s) Encountered Risk(s) Institutional condition(s)
    Institutional consequence(s) WIM WIM is capable of differentiating between the
    load and the vehicle. It is possible to identify not only the transporter, but
    also the owner of the load. Enforcement of regulations is therefore greatly improved.
    Interoperability and integration: variety of technologies and lack of standards
    introduced difficulties integrating data The definition of the service and the
    identification of possible solutions with regards to standards and integration.
    Innovation and standard definition was required in order to be able to ensure
    interoperability. Clashes in planning with other processes such as traffic management.
    Communication and coordination of activities between primary processes needed
    to be defined and improved to avoid clashes. Coordination mechanisms between primary
    processes needed to be developed. LMW Improved efficiency, effectiveness and flexibility
    of a wide variety of public services, as the gathering of this data is centralized
    and each service and party no longer has to gather the data themselves. Interoperability
    and integration: lack of technical knowledge due to the wide variety of different
    types of equipment with different coupling technologies used by the measuring
    stations. New skills needed to be acquired to be able to develop interoperable
    processes IT infrastructure needed to be adjusted to introduce interoperating
    systems. New, dedicated teams required to manage IT infra 5. Discussion The duality
    of technology describes technology as assuming structural properties whilst being
    the product of human action (Orlikowski, 1992). Technology is physically constructed
    by actors in a social context, and socially constructed by actors through the
    different meanings they attach to it, and thus, technology results from the ongoing
    interaction of human choices and institutional contexts (Orlikowski, 1992). Duality
    of technology was used as lens in this research to elaborate on the details of
    how benefits are realized and risks are faced in different organizational and
    domain contexts and to understand the importance of benefits and risk factors
    identified in the literature. The lens provided us with an efficient way of identifying
    relationships between the benefits of IoT and the risks which accompany the adoption
    of IoT in organizations and proved to be appropriate for this research. According
    to Leonardi (2013), the duality of technology model is important as a waypoint
    to Orlikowski (2000) practice lens. Leonardi (2013) believes that, having already
    conceptualized technology use as a constitutive feature of structure in its own
    right, Orlikowski (2000) introduced the development of the practice lens, the
    “technology-in-practice,” which Orlikowski (2000), p. 405) defined as “a particular
    structure of technology use”. As such, Leonardi (2013) argues that the practice
    lens tends to hide patterns of technology use into particular “technologies-in-practice”
    as people tend to interpret how technology could help them achieve their goals.
    Leonardi (2013) also criticizes the practice lens for offering an overly socialized
    view of technology. Leonardi (2013) critique is based on the idea that people
    choose to use technology in a certain way. As such, the technologies themselves
    “are only peripheral players that are subject to the whims of their users” (Leonardi
    (2013), p. 64). By way of example, (Leonardi (2013), p. 64) cites Orlikowski (2000)
    as arguing that “even though technologies have certain physical or digital properties
    that transcend specific contexts of use, users have the option to choose other
    options with the technology at hand, opening up the potential for innovation,
    learning, and change”. Leonardi (2013) argues that technology-in-practice is therefore
    only a set of norms governing when, why, and how to use a technology in a specific
    setting. As such, using other theories such as socio-materiality may provide further
    insights, and more research in this area is recommended. Case study methodology
    was used in this research to identify relationships between benefits and risks
    of IoT adoption in organizations in real-world situations. Both cases are involved
    in asset management in the public sector, and the number of measuring stations
    is similar. Significant differences are in the asset types and number of sensors
    utilised in the system. Both LMW and WIM are shared systems, which means that
    the data is shared with several parties and can be used in legal processes. In
    this research two interview rounds were used. In the second round, some interviewees
    were different to the first round due to staff changes. This limits the results
    of the research as it is possible that the original interviewees may have given
    different answers. However, it does highlight a risk faced by many IoT adoption
    projects, namely that staff does change during the project, and the need for substantial
    changes as other capabilities are needed for IoT adoption, but also meaning possible
    loss or gain of knowledge and possible changes to solution architectures. The
    asset management domain was chosen because IoT has much potential for improving
    control and maintenance of assets. This might limit the generalizability to other
    domains, however, the essence of IoT generating data, driven by expected benefits
    is likely the same. The others might be context dependent and further research
    is recommended to investigate this. Expected benefits of IoT in asset management
    may introduce unexpected risks (Brous & Janssen, 2015a) for the improvement of
    asset management in public utility infrastructure networks. Public utility infrastructure
    networks such as electricity networks and transportation networks provide many
    of the services that are vital to the functioning, and security of society, and
    managing these assets effectively and efficiently is critical (Tien et al., 2016).
    IoT can be used to manage the physical world in various ways (Mihailovic, 2016;
    Neisse et al., 2016), and many of these infrastructure networks have an extensive
    range of physical and social sensors to detect damage and monitor capabilities
    (Aono, Lajnef, Faridazar, & Chakrabartty, 2016; Tien et al., 2016). However, as
    suggested by Damanpour and Gopalakrishnan (1998), many public utility organizations
    traditionally have a hierarchical organizational form with stable environments
    and low innovation adoption rates. The increasing rate of change driven by IoT
    may therefore create unique challenges for these organizations for IoT adoption.
    In asset management, benefits are often viewed as resulting from the use of IoT,
    in other words, IoT as medium of human action. Benefits resulting from other types
    of duality influences, such as knowledge development, personal development of
    staff, or improvements to the organizational culture are often “hidden” or secondary
    benefits and may not be the main drivers of IoT adoption in the asset management
    domain. This may be different in other domains such as research and further research
    is required in these areas. In the following sections the results of the case
    studies are discussed in relation to the propositions outlined in Section 3. In
    Section 5.5 we take a step back from the propositions, summarizing how the duality
    of IoT may impact organizations, and discuss necessary steps that need to be taken
    before benefits of IoT can be achieved. 5.1. Proposition 1: IoT is developed and
    implemented in order to achieve expected benefits Orlikowski (1992) identifies
    technology as being the product of human action, while it also assumes structural
    properties. Furthermore, technology is physically constructed by actors working
    in a given social context and socially constructed by actors through the different
    meaning they attach to it. This requires discriminating between human activity
    which affects technology, and human activity which is affected by technology (López-Muñoz
    & Escribá-Esteve, 2017). As such, according to Kabanda and Brown (2017), duality
    of technology theory provides opportunities for understanding changes in the social
    order and helps us understand the innovation process in its specific sociocultural
    context. According to Brous et al. (2018), IoT may bring an improved understanding
    of complex processes which is expected to help improve the efficiency of transport
    management and infrastructure services, and help with effective reporting. In
    Table 6 we notice that the adoption of the LMW system has allowed RWS to develop
    new predictive maintenance models for the maintenance and management of the LMW
    sensors. As such, IoT infrastructure could potentially be used to reduce costs
    in terms of time and money as traditional methods of inspecting infrastructure
    are often reactive in nature and require significant amounts of time and use of
    costly equipment. For example, Hollands (2008) describes a differentiation between
    smart cities that focus on IoT purely for economic prosperity and those that seek
    to become sustainable and inclusive. 5.2. Proposition 2: IoT can facilitate human
    action, but also poses significant risks to organizations such that expected benefits
    are often not achieved The duality of technology argues that actors use information
    technologies to constitute structures, but at the same time, information technologies
    become part of the structures constraining individual actions (see Orlikowski,
    1992). The dual nature of technology suggests that adoption of IoT might result
    in new structures, but IoT can also be adopted within existing structures. In
    these situations IoT might have positive impacts, resulting in desired improvements,
    but when the necessary changes are not made could also exert negative effects.
    with forced mitigation of unexpected risks. For example, IoT can benefit organizations
    by providing enough quality data to generate the information required to help
    asset managers make the right decisions at the right time (Brous & Janssen, 2015b),
    but automating processes often necessarily leads to changes to organizational
    structures and cultures as tasks previously performed by people become automated,
    whilst other tasks and responsibilities which previously did not exist become
    apparent. As seen in Table 6, an unexpected risk which has previously not been
    recognized in literature is the realization that data quality is also a significant
    risk as well as being a potential benefit. Organizations and previous research
    often suggest that a large part of the business case of IoT lies with the improved
    quality (timeliness, precision etc.) of data. However, automating mission-critical
    primary processes means that data quality needs to be guaranteed, and real-world
    challenges often mean that system configurations need to be highly complex. Results
    of case studies described by Wahyudi et al. (2018) suggest that suggest that decisions
    based on big data are often ad-hoc as decision-makers are often unable to make
    sense of the information delivered by big data. The WIM case shows that trust
    in the system and in the quality of data needs to be systematic and embedded in
    legal frameworks. As such, achieving benefits of IoT adoption often requires accounting
    for a variety of systematic risks. For example, sensors might not work or might
    emit the wrong signals, resulting in poor quality information, annoyance for the
    public, a reduction of trust in the system and damage to the reputation of the
    organization. 5.3. Proposition 3: achieving benefits of IoT adoption requires
    new skills, roles and processes Research in the sociology of technology suggests
    that the evolution of new applications is a process of social interaction between
    multiple agents (Allen, 2003). According to Orlikowski (1992), agency refers to
    capability not intentionality, and action taken by actors may have unintended
    consequences. This is confirmed in our analyses shown in Table 3. For example,
    the intention of RWS to open WIM data to the general public has led to the development
    of extra data management and data manipulation processes to ensure privacy of
    citizens as number plates and people need to be made unidentifiable. This has
    meant extra costs, changes to IT due to new requirements and the development of
    required skills. Initial research on IoT adoption has tended to focus on the potential
    of technology as a catalyst for IoT adoption, but more recent debates have increasingly
    stressed the voice of the citizen and the relationship of the citizen with public
    sector organizations (Castelnovo, Misuraca, & Savoldelli, 2015; van Waart, Mulder,
    & de Bont, 2015), stressing the duality of IoT. van Waart et al. (2015) go so
    far as to suggest that IoT technologies increase efficiency of public services
    such as public transportation, traffic management, or energy management but does
    not necessarily lead to an increased well-being of citizens. Using IoT to manage
    infrastructure from a purely economic perspective may be cheaper and more efficient,
    but ignoring the social impact of IoT may also introduce unexpected risks to the
    organization. Traditional inspections of infrastructure are often performed subjectively.
    In other words, inspectors visually inspect the asset at regular intervals and
    make expert judgments based on what they see and their past experience. However,
    the regularity of these inspections, and their subjective nature means that the
    inspection can often vary in quality and granularity (Phares, Washer, Rolander,
    Graybeal, & Moore, 2004). 5.4. Proposition 4: mitigating the risks of IoT adoption
    often requires structural changes to the organization A duality of achieving cost
    reduction is the need for IoT maintenance requiring not only investments now,
    but also in the future. According to an RWS official, “because of the number of
    measuring stations and the geographic spread of the sensors, implementation and
    maintenance of the sensor network is a costly affair”. The duality is that new
    technology results in the need for a new maintenance departments, which in turn
    influences the technology to ensure low-cost maintenance of IoT devices. Although
    IoT adoption can improve management and maintenance planning and assist organizations
    with the development and enforcement of more efficient regulations, the heterogeneity
    of IoT and of the people using IoT means that interoperability of IoT data and
    IoT systems and the integration of IoT within new and existing processes can pose
    significant risks to achieving successful adoption of IoT and the achievement
    of the expected benefits. As suggested by Brous et al. (2018), new organizational
    processes are needed to ensure that IoT works properly. For example, the adoption
    of LMW has meant that the control of bridges (e.g. opening and closing and evaluating
    needs for maintenance) can be performed centrally, leading to a central department,
    but also that the skills required for maintaining the bridges are less focused
    on pure asset management and more on data and IT management. Nevertheless, there
    still is a need for physical inspection, as IoT cannot replace this, but it will
    be less and more focused by taking a data-driven approach. According to one interviewees
    “some LMW processes were adjusted too quickly”. Another interviewee suggested
    that “smaller contracts and a number of facility tasks should may have been better
    positioned with the line managers”. As such, the duality of introducing IoT for
    the purposes of improving planning and efficiency is that organizations often
    need to change and adapt predefined business processes (Brous et al., 2018). Resistance
    of staff to these changes and a lack of trust in the IoT systems can mean that
    achievement of benefits is limited. Furthermore, although IoT promises significant
    economic benefits to the organization due to automation of processes and previously
    unforeseen insights, IoT adoption also demands significant investment which can
    pose significant financial risk for organizations. An often overseen risk of economic
    savings in our cases was that staff need to be reassigned, re-educated or even
    be made redundant. 5.5. Summary: duality of IoT in organizations The results of
    the case studies show that adoption of IoT is initiated by the desire to achieve
    certain benefits. Often the initial business case is based on the operational
    benefits that IoT may provide such as the provision of real-time data allowing
    for improved reaction times. For example, WIM inspectors can monitor freight traffic
    without having to pull each truck off the road to weigh them, and respond immediately
    when overloading is detected. Due to the specific requirements for each case,
    technology often has to be developed or configured to fit the specific environments
    and meet requirements. Development and implementation of IoT therefore also presents
    risks to the organization as well as the adoption process itself as there are
    often institutional conditions of IoT adoption, such as ensuring the necessary
    knowledge and capacity to use, manage and maintain the systems effectively. Mitigating
    these risks, which are often unexpected, can result in institutional consequences,
    new requirements, but also in new benefits. As such, Fig. 2 below shows that benefits
    of IoT are often only achieved once the institutional conditions of IoT adoption
    have been met, and the institutional consequences of IoT adoption have been accepted.

    Fig. 2. The impact of IoT adoption on organizations. To illustrate the figure,
    (a) IoT is developed by people to provide improved data quality, and volumes of
    real-time data. (1) IoT can benefit organizations by improving forecasting and
    trend analysis which allows organizations to better predict the infrastructure
    needs of the future for developing communities. However, using IoT data (bi) might
    also harm society through violation of privacy. For example, (2) organizations
    often encounter usability issues during privacy impact assessments. Table 7 shows
    that the analysis of the stored measurement data from WIM has revealed patterns,
    which allows ILT to perform roadside inspections in a subsequent inspection or
    to visit the parent company for an inspection. The duality is that organizations
    also need to be aware of potential conflicts related to data privacy issues (c)
    and to take necessary measures to ensure data protection. For example, new activities
    (3) are introduced to ensure that all WIM data is thoroughly checked and all number
    plates and other identifiable data are removed before any data is made “open”
    or publicly available. The new roles require structural changes (d) to the organization.
    For example, (4) the development of new skills and knowledge, and a lack of standardized
    architectures and solutions often force organizations to develop new departments,
    hire new staff and invest heavily in knowledge development. However, the organizational,
    process and staff changes have also led to changes in the technology as user requirements
    become clearer (5). This attention to privacy and security has also led to greater
    transparency in organizations (6), affecting the reputations of organizations
    and empowering the general public to be more self-sufficient and to make their
    needs better known. For example, making WIM data open has meant that all WIM processes
    are clearly defined and documented and opened for the general public. However,
    greater transparency also means that organizations are more vulnerable to public
    scrutiny and need to take greater care to ensure that policy, regulations, and
    legal frameworks are in place and strictly followed. Furthermore, the open aspect
    of IoT allows better data sharing so that multiple goals may be achieved with
    the same data (bii). For example, (6) the adoption of LMW has meant the introduction
    a single data collection process, but the openness of the data means that the
    data can be used to serve multiple goals such as monitoring water levels for the
    purposes of the storm surge barriers, but also messages to skippers and also for
    swimming water quality. We observed that more timely data providing real-time
    information allows organizations to streamline services, reducing unnecessary
    overhead and improving the ability to react timely to events. Table 6 shows that
    inspectors are able to monitor the weights of lorries in real time and are able
    to allow traffic to flow more easily instead of having to stop and check every
    lorry and physically weigh them. Previous technology adoption models tend to describe
    adoption process as being linear. The model described in Fig. 2 develops the structuration
    model of Orlikowski (1992) and is further essentially different from previous
    adoption models and information system models as it demonstrates that not only
    is successful adoption of IoT dependent on both organizational and human conditions,
    as well as requiring the technology to be of sufficient maturity, but that adoption
    is a continuous cycle, as new knowledge and organizational forms provide new requirements
    and uses for the technology which drives further development of the technology.
    These new technological advances then, in turn have a social impact on the organization
    and people etc. Benefits of IoT are often only achieved once the institutional
    conditions of IoT adoption have been met, and the institutional consequences of
    IoT adoption have been accepted. These conditions and consequences often then
    lead to new insights, uses, and requirements. 6. Conclusions Although IoT provides
    many benefits the use of the technology is a product of human actions and these
    actions determine the actual benefits to be gained. This research provides a systematic
    overview of potential benefits and risks of IoT and insight into the duality of
    IoT in two cases. The objective of this paper was to analyze the impact of IoT
    adoption by organizations. Four propositions were and defined and four research
    questions were asked. The first research question asked what the benefits of adopting
    IoT in organizations are. The categories of benefits of IoT adoption in organizations
    can be summarized as: • The capability to provide (more) timely information for
    decision-making and greater response times • Automation of decision-making • Improved
    planning due to insights created by higher volumes of data • Reduction of operational
    costs due to improved data quality • Insights into possible new revenue streams
    due to linking capability of data • Better communication with clients due to open
    nature of the data These conclusions suggest to researchers and practitioners
    that expected benefits are often related to the use of data generated by IoT,
    such as operational reactions to data generated by IoT sensors, and that IoT whilst
    obviously useful for action-reaction use cases, can provide organizations with
    much greater benefits than purely operational benefits. For example, the closing
    of storm surge barriers when sensors detect a rise in sea levels. The increased
    volumes and velocity of data being generated, as well as the possibility of being
    able to link the data to other data sources allows organizations to generate new
    insights into their primary processes allowing them to take pre-emptive actions
    instead of having to react to unexpected events. However, adopting IoT can often
    introduce a variety of expected and unexpected risks to organizations, and the
    second research question asks what the risks of IoT adoption for organizations
    are. The categories of risks of IoT adoption can be summarized as: • Non-compliance
    with privacy regulations • High implementation costs • Interoperability and integration
    issues • Security risks • Lack of knowledge and risk awareness • Lack of trust
    Researchers and practitioners should note that the openness aspect of IoT which
    allows better data sharing so that multiple goals may be achieved with the same
    data also places organizations at risk due to data privacy and data security issues,
    introducing the need for specific policies and legal frameworks and defined data
    governance structures and processes. Also, the linked aspect of IoT means the
    presence of security risks for organizations as well as risks related to interoperability
    and integration. This can in turn lead to the development of industry standards
    which, as witnessed in the WIM case has a dual impact on the technology itself
    through innovation. As such there are often organizational conditions required
    for benefits of IoT to be achieved, and the third sub-question asks what the organizational
    conditions for IoT adoption are. The organizational conditions of IoT adoption
    can be summarized as follows: • Implementation of a data quality framework • Implementation
    of data governance • Development of technical skills • Ensuring IoT capabilities
    in IT infrastructure • Ensuring flexible procurement policies • Strong data architectures
    including standards and protocols Researchers and practitioners should note that
    many of the issues which occur are interrelated, and there are often consequences
    that can go beyond the accomplishment of the intended benefits. The fourth sub-question
    therefore asks what the organizational consequences of IoT adoption are. Organizational
    consequences of IoT adoption can be summarized as follows: • Structural changes
    to data management departments – new roles, and often new departments such as
    the Chief Data Office • New responsibilities to monitor configurations, often
    leading to new teams and structural changes to the organization • Structural changes
    to procurement policies and processes • Structural changes to business processes
    • Structural changes to strategy and policy making • Structural changes to communication
    Improved planning and forecasting by means of IoT data required structural and
    significant changes to the IT infrastructure in our cases. Also new knowledge
    and specialist skills were required, leading to changes in staffing and organizational
    structures. For example, the development of WIM required a close alliance with
    knowledge institutions to develop the technology, and specific skills were needed
    to be developed in order to properly calibrate the system. As seen in Fig. 2,
    this research shows that successful adoption of IoT depends on both organizational
    and human conditions, as well as requiring the technology to be of sufficient
    maturity. Furthermore, we may conclude that adoption of IoT is a continuous cycle,
    as new knowledge and organizational forms provide new requirements and uses for
    IoT which drives further development of the technology. It is clear that IoT can
    provide organizations with many potential benefits, however, organizations should
    realize that achieving these benefits carries potentially unexpected risks and,
    as suggested by the duality of technology, introduces changes to the organization
    and the systems. More research is required into the potential long-term consequences
    of IoT adoption and practitioners need to make the necessary organizational changes
    to fully profit from IoT. Funding This work was supported by Rijkswaterstaat,

  limitations: The research has several limitations. First, the number of cases is
    limited to two. While this allowed for in-depth analysis, the results may not
    be generalizable to other domains or sectors. Second, the research only focused
    on the adoption of IoT in public sector organizations, and it is not clear whether
    the results are transferable to private sector organizations. Third, the research
    did not consider the long-term effects of IoT adoption, and it is possible that
    some of the benefits and risks identified in this study may only become apparent
    over time.

    advance the theory and practice of managing collaborative data networks for information
    and decision-support services that exist in over 400 US metropolitan areas. Integrating
    insights from collaborative governance, network management, and cross-boundary
    information sharing, this study develops a framework to outline the interplay
    between context, management, collaborative dynamics, technology, and performance.
    This study further utilizes the framework to conduct an exploratory in-depth case
    study of a metropolitan transportation data network to examine such interplay.
    The findings suggest ways to improve the performance of collaborative data networks
    and their implications are discussed. KEYWORDS: Digital governmentcross-boundary
    information sharingcollaborative governancenetwork management Previous article
    View issue table of contents Next article Introduction In the digital government
    area, there is a growing need for collaborative governance across organizational
    boundaries to leverage technology to provide an integrated and customized view
    of public service (Dawes, Cresswell, and Pardo 2009). Such cross-boundary collaboration
    is particularly critical in a federalist administrative system for integrating
    data that have been collected in individual jurisdictions but need to be integrated
    to create a service-oriented view. The primary research question is ‘How can we
    govern and manage cross-boundary collaborative networks with the use of information
    and communication technology (ICT) to improve the performance of information and
    decision-support service?’ This question focuses on collaborative data governance
    networks, which are critical to the success of generating quality information
    for cross-boundary public services such as transportation. Moreover, this question
    aims to understand the role of ICT in improving performance of such networks.
    To advance our understanding of collaborative data networks, this study attempts
    (1) to develop a conceptual framework that integrates insights from three streams
    of research: electronic government (e-government), collaborative governance, and
    network management and (2) to explore network governance and management as well
    as the role of ICT in achieving a high level of network performance. The link
    between governance, management, and performance has been identified as one main
    area of research for network management literature (O’Toole 2015). To address
    the research question, this study conducted an in-depth case study of metropolitan
    planning organizations (MPOs) and their collaborative governance networks in metropolitan
    areas for transportation information and decision-support services. It is a federal
    mandate to establish a MPO for any metropolitan area with a population of 50,000
    or above. Such MPOs manage a network of local governments for better planning.
    In examining these MPOs, this study’s focus is on transportation data for local
    governments and regional entities to make planning decisions. The collection of
    transportation data is typically done by autonomous local jurisdictions. As a
    result, information sharing across jurisdictions becomes a necessity to create
    an integrated view of metropolitan transportation. Such transportation data also
    present opportunities for effective use of ICT, which aligns with the goal of
    this study. The following section provides a brief description of the relevant
    bodies of literature on collaborative data governance networks. Then, a conceptual
    framework drawing from these relevant bodies of literature is outlined. Next is
    a discussion of research design, methods, and data. The next section provides
    case description, analysis, and findings. This article then discusses the practical
    and theoretical implications of the findings. It concludes with a summary of the
    main points and opportunities for future research. Literature review E-government
    literature on cross-boundary information sharing The existing e-government literature
    on cross-boundary information sharing provides insight for this research. For
    politics and policy, Dawes, Cresswell, and Pardo ( 2009) articulate the need for
    legal authority in effective information sharing. Having an information policy
    is critical because policy issues tend to be the biggest barrier to successful
    information sharing (Dawes, Cresswell, and Pardo 2009; Yang and Maxwell 2011).
    Politics is central to information technology (IT) projects that span over functional
    areas and organizational boundaries (Hellberg and Grönlund 2013; Dawes 1996).
    The different interests between IT departments and other business departments,
    as articulated by Kraemer et al. ( 1989), is a source of politics. One of the
    fundamental issues for effective information sharing is to develop shared values
    across organizations. In fact, implementation of data interoperability can be
    significantly hampered by conflicts in values such as the emphasis on privacy
    at the expense of other basic objectives of interoperability (Hellberg and Grönlund
    2013). Another key organizational factor for effectiveness is past collaborative
    experience among organizations that speaks to the mutual trust needed for cross-boundary
    information sharing (Yang and Maxwell 2011). Moreover, the difference in operational
    procedures can also pose a barrier to successful information sharing due to the
    complexity and amount of negotiation involved to address these differences (Yang,
    Zheng, and Pardo 2012). To achieve effective information sharing, incentives constitute
    a key tool (Yang and Maxwell 2011). Technology and data are also important factors
    in effective cross-boundary information and service collaboration (Dawes, Cresswell,
    and Pardo 2009; Bekkers 2007). Especially, different IT capabilities can present
    a challenge for information sharing and service integration. Technical assistance
    and training is likely needed for those organizations and individuals lacking
    the prerequisite knowledge and skills to be effective participants in cross-boundary
    settings. For cross-boundary data sharing, issues such as variety of data definitions
    and formats present significant challenges for creating a meaningful and personalized
    view of disparate data coming from various organizations (Comfort 2007). Collaborative
    governance for information service The studies of collaborative governance have
    identified both the context and condition of success (Emerson, Nabatchi, and Balogh
    2012; Ansell and Gash 2008). Important contextual factors include the existing
    policy and legal framework, levels of conflicts (trust), interdependence, incentives,
    and leadership (Emerson, Nabatchi, and Balogh 2012; Ansell and Gash 2008). A policy
    and legal framework for the governance regime provides the shared institutional
    foundation for collaboration (Bingham 2008). Such a framework facilitates the
    creation of shared understanding that is needed for inter-organizational collaboration
    (Wood and Gray 1991). A high level of conflict preceding the formation of a collaborative
    governance presents a major challenge to that collaborative governance (Emerson,
    Nabatchi, and Balogh 2012). The degree of interdependence is an important motivation
    for collaboration across organizational boundaries (Rethemeyer 2009; Rethemeyer
    and Hatmaker 2008). Incentives for organizational and individual participants
    constitute another important contextual consideration. Lastly, leadership and
    management are crucial for the success of collaborative governance networks (Provan
    and Kenis 2008). In terms of process and dynamics of collaborative governance,
    Emerson, Nabatchi, and Balogh ( 2012) provide three main areas of activities:
    principled engagement, shared motivation, and capacity-building for joint action.
    The guiding principles for principled engagement include fair and representative
    participation, and discourse informed by diverse participant perspectives. Shared
    motivation involves the process of fostering mutual trust, shared understanding,
    and securing and carrying out commitment by individual participating organizations
    (Emerson, Nabatchi, and Balogh 2012, 13–14). Shared motivations can foster commitment
    that can be translated into concrete plans and actions. Capacity-building for
    joint action is a critical area of activities for collaborative dynamics. To build
    capacity, Emerson, Nabatchi, and Balogh ( 2012) argue for the need for institutions
    (procedures and arrangements), leadership, and resources to guide and effectuate
    joint actions at both organizational and individual levels. Network management
    Network management literature has highlighted structural characteristics to help
    identify relevant leadership and management activities (O’Toole 2015; Provan and
    Lemaire 2012). Structural characteristics include who has what operational authority,
    the grouping of various organizations and individuals for network governance (i.e.
    boards, committees), communication channels and mechanisms, and the prior history
    of collaboration (Agranoff 2007). Network management matters in performance (Meier
    and O’toole 2001; McGuire and Silvia 2010). Specific network management activities
    can involve activating key network members, mobilizing their support and commitment,
    framing the key issues and objectives for the network, and synthesizing the diverse
    interests to create a network whole (McGuire 2006, 2002). These network activities
    share the generic goals and objectives of network management such as building
    mutual trust (social capital), creating shared goals and understanding, and wide
    distribution of needed resources. Network performance can be measured by result-oriented
    outcomes and process-oriented outcomes (Provan and Milward 2001; Chen 2008). Examples
    of result-oriented outcomes include the number of children in stable families
    through a children’s service network or the number of job placements by a network
    of job-training organizations. Process-oriented outcomes are those dealing with
    increase in mutual trust, shared understanding, and social capital. These performance
    measures need to be in alignment with the goals and objectives of a network. Another
    important perspective of network performance is the level at which performance
    is measured. Provan and Milward ( 2001) argue the importance of differentiating
    network effectiveness at the levels of individuals, programme, and community as
    well as caution against the potential trade-offs between performance scores at
    these levels. An integrated conceptual framework for information and decision-support
    networks The development of the proposed integrated conceptual framework draws
    from the aforementioned bodies of literature and is adapted to networks providing
    information and decision-support services. The core elements are the context and
    initial conditions (i.e. existing level of trust), collaborative processes, network
    leadership and management activities, ICT use, and performance. Figure 1 depicts
    the framework with these key components and potential relationships. Figure 1.
    An integrated conceptual framework of managing a collaborative network for information
    and decision-support services. Display full size Context and initial conditions
    The structural characteristics include both authority and grouping (Agranoff 2007).
    Authority refers to the legal and/or administrative authority of various network-participating
    organizations to make decisions. Such authority usually has a legal or administrative
    source. The distribution of authority is a main source of potential power imbalance
    and conflict. Grouping is about the institutional and organizational design with
    regard to the governance of the network. Grouping specifies the main governing
    body of the network, the representation of various network-participating organizations,
    and the existence and organization of potential subnetworks. A subnetwork could
    be the group of public employees and organizations for a functional area (i.e.
    finance, planning) as opposed to a subgroup of elected officials. Initial conditions
    are critical for appropriate institutional design, collaborative processes, and
    management strategies (O’Toole 2015; Emerson, Nabatchi, and Balogh 2012; Ansell
    and Gash 2008). The initial level of mutual trust resulting from a prior history
    of collaboration and/or conflict is a critical consideration for the network leadership
    and management effort. Another important condition to examine is interdependence
    as captured mainly in the resource flow (Park and Rethemeyer 2014). Such interdependence
    shapes the degree of motivation for participating in a particular network and
    the level of commitment at the implementation stage. A higher level of interdependence
    is likely to foster shared motivation once articulated and perceived by the key
    network member organizations. The information and decision-support networks necessitate
    the consideration of data and technology (Dawes, Cresswell, and Pardo 2009; Yang
    and Maxwell 2011), although these have not been identified as one of the core
    components in collaborative governance. Data are the building blocks of information
    interoperability and analytics for decision support. A network-wide common data
    collection method and definition can significantly reduce the effort involved
    in information interoperability. The characteristics of ICT being deployed also
    make a difference. From the network and collaborative governance perspective,
    heterogeneity of the technologies used and technical capabilities of implementing
    them can be an impediment to quality information and decision-support service.
    Collaborative processes Collaborative processes are the interactions and activities
    that address the specific context and initial conditions of a network collaboration.
    For trust-building, networks can raise the level of mutual trust by exercising
    the norm of reciprocity and delivering on their commitments. The information and
    decision-support networks are likely to follow a similar process to build trust.
    However, differences could arise in the focus on information-related activities,
    in which participating organizations reciprocate with each other by sharing information
    and maintaining the capacity to deliver data to the entire network as a whole
    in a timely and reliable manner. At the same time, fostering a shared understanding
    of the goals and nature of the service challenge in a network context is important
    (Ansell and Gash 2008). Meetings and communications should aid in such a shared
    understanding. Building institutions/rules for joint action is another main area
    of collaborative interactions. For collaborative networks, governance institutions
    correspond to authority and grouping. For instance, a governance board has the
    authority to decide on information standards and data ownership issues. These
    authority rules, as well as the rules on data standards, are critical for the
    effectiveness of information and decision-support networks. From an operational
    perspective, there need to be rules on who needs to share what information and
    when for conducting joint actions across the entire network. Building technical
    capacity for joint action requires addressing heterogeneity in data standards
    as well as technological capability among various participating organizations
    and individuals. One way to build such technical capacity is to create a central
    information system to facilitate information sharing across organizational boundaries.
    Coupled with appropriate user training for use of the system, the network can
    build the capacity of individual participating organizations by applying the same
    technical standards for data collection and quality assurance before sharing with
    the entire network. Since networks are designed to implement interdependent tasks,
    the collaborative process should focus on managing interdependence. Providing
    tangible financial incentives for individual organizations to share information
    is a way to manage information–resource interdependence. Only when a network has
    all the various pieces of information from various contributing organizations,
    can it provide an enterprise or holistic perspective of the operation and service.
    Leadership and management activities and use of ICT Leadership and management
    activities entail leading and managing the collaborative processes. Recognizing
    major gaps in the conditions for success is an important first step in helping
    a network to achieve its goals. This recognition requires situational awareness
    to develop an appropriate strategy. If the network’s primary issue is a lack of
    mutual trust among participating organizations, leadership and management should
    focus on trust-building by fostering shared understanding and employing regular,
    meaningful communication via face-to-face and other means. If trust is in place
    and the primary barrier is the lack of a common data standard, effort should be
    directed to building institutions for joint action in the area of developing common
    data standards. Addressing the issue of information policy and data standards
    is particularly prominent in the success of cross-boundary information sharing
    to create a service-oriented view of information and service (Dawes, Cresswell,
    and Pardo 2009). Moreover, a network manager needs to understand the interplay
    between these processes of trust-building, institutional design, capacity-building,
    and interdependence management. The network manager may need to simultaneously
    engage in various management activities such as activating, mobilizing, and synthesizing.
    One of the most productive tools while engaging in all these activities is the
    utilization of tangible and intangible incentives. A positive payoff is needed
    for network participants to overcome the tendency to advance only the narrow interests
    of the home organization rather than those of the network. Network leaders and
    managers can utilize ICT for managing collaborative processes as well as for direct
    service provision. For collaborative process management, ICT applications such
    as video conferencing and centralized project management software can facilitate
    regular communication as well as the demonstration of reciprocity and commitments.
    Moreover, a centralized information management system can be part of a network’s
    technical assistance to participating organizations and individuals with limited
    technical capability to build technical capability for joint action. The use of
    applications can aid in information service production. For instance, a modelling
    module in a geographic information system (GIS) can aid in the impact analysis
    of a regional planning master plan. Performance of network service production
    and delivery For this study, the discussion of performance focuses primarily on
    the networks providing information and decision-support services. A task-oriented
    perspective examines the main components and processes needed for the production
    and delivery of information and decision-support services. The initial task is
    the data collection by participating organizations. Quality of data collection,
    use of a network-wide standard, and timeliness of data collection are potential
    performance measures. The second task is data sharing across the network. Quality
    can mean whether such sharing has reached its target network audience with the
    appropriate format in a timely way. The third task is a network administrative
    organization’s compliance with and integration of data from participating organizations
    and sources into a standardized view of data. Quality is measured by the level
    of standardization and whether data are relevant to making decisions. The last
    task involves the analysis of data and the communication of results to support
    the decision-making process. Both the timeliness of such analysis and the effectiveness
    of communication as perceived by users can be relevant performance measures. Research
    design, methods, and data This study employs an exploratory case study method
    to answer the research questions. This method helps address a current research
    gap in understanding the process aspects of information and decision-support network
    management and the interplay between context, collaborative processes, management,
    and performance. Although case study does not offer confirmative statistical correlation
    in a large N study, it provides opportunities to improve conceptual validity,
    generate new hypotheses, and explore causal mechanisms and complex interactions
    (George and Bennett 2005; Yin 2003). The case selected is a governance network
    run by a MPO that spans two Midwestern states. The focus of the study is on the
    network activity associated with transportation planning, which requires the MPO
    to compile, integrate, and analyse transportation data to provide information
    services to participating governments and to support their transportation-related
    decisions. The MPO, however, does not have authority over participating governments
    in terms of data collection. As a result, metropolitan transportation data collection
    and compilation are commonly done in a collaborative manner in a network of governments
    and organizations. The primary data collection included document reviews and interviews.
    In March and April 2015, our research team had meetings with key staff members
    in the MPO to introduce this research project and ask for their support. The MPO
    allowed us to access internal documents (e.g. Memorandum of Agreement for Transportation
    Planning and Programming) and introduced potential interviewees. This study reviewed
    key internal and publicly available documents on the structure and activities
    of the MPO and transportation planning. This study also conducted interviews with
    seven key stakeholders, including three participating governments (two from a
    county government and one from a city government) that provide data to the MPO,
    and four staff members in the MPO (a programme director, two planners, and a GIS
    coordinator). Interview questions were designed to capture key variables in our
    research framework (see selected interview questions in Appendix A). These interview
    transcripts provide information on the workflow, specific data collected, technology,
    staffing, incentives, collaborative activities and interactions, and areas for
    improvement. Data analysis followed the guidelines and processes of case data
    analysis as suggested by Yin ( 2003) as well as Miles, Michael Huberman, and Saldana
    ( 2014). Based on the documents and interviews, we established the history and
    context of the case. The case analysis follows the main components identified
    in the proposed framework (see Figure 1) while allowing for the emergence of nuances
    and patterns. We have also examined the processes of production and delivery of
    information and decision-support service by establishing the workflow for data
    gathering and analysis as well as communication of the results. Additionally,
    we have identified key factors for success by identifying the themes of the interview
    data. Case description and analysis Organizational context The specific case of
    collaborative data governance is the Metropolitan Area Planning Agency (MAPA).
    MAPA was established in the 1970s as the chief planning agency for the Omaha-Council
    Bluffs metropolitan area spanning metropolitan territory in Nebraska and Iowa
    with a combined population of approximately 865,000 according to the US 2010 Census.
    The main governance body of MAPA is a 63-member council of officials, representing
    each of the 63 governmental units that comprise MAPA. Most decisions are made
    by the Policy Board of Directors (PBD), which is comprised members from local
    governments in both the State of Nebraska and the State of Iowa. 1 The main areas
    of responsibilities for MAPA include transportation data and planning as well
    as community and economic development. The biggest area of responsibilities is
    transportation data for regional planning. MAPA is the designated agency in the
    Omaha-Council Bluffs metropolitan area for transportation data that are locally
    collected by participating governments in the metropolitan area, including the
    City of Omaha, Douglas County, and Sarpy County in Nebraska and the City of Council
    Bluffs and Pottawattamie County in the state of Iowa. MAPA is responsible for
    obtaining data from these government bodies to create a metropolitan transportation
    plan and for producing a comprehensive transportation improvement plan every 4
    years. Context and initial conditions Based on the analysis of the documents and
    interview data, we provided a summary of findings in Table 1. This table includes
    data and relevant facts as well as the narrative on features of various components
    context and initial conditions. Table 1. Conditions and context of the collaborative
    transportation data governance. Download CSVDisplay Table Authority and grouping
    The overall authority of MAPA originates from the Federal Government’s mandate
    designating it the organization for metropolitan area-planning purposes. MAPA
    has authority over participating local and state governments to act as the coordinating
    agency to compile transportation data, conduct analysis, and prepare reports for
    the Federal Department of Transportation for its metropolitan area (MAPA 2014).
    However, it does not have explicit authority to collect data on the ground. Nor
    does it have the authority to dictate transportation data collection methods.
    Inside MAPA, the PBD is the top-level decision-making body that oversees all decisions
    made by MAPA, including transportation issues. The highest technical authority
    for transportation data and planning is the Transportation Technical Advisory
    Committee (TTAC). Both the PBD and TTAC have authority over the program office
    of MAPA with regard to transportation planning. Two types of network grouping
    emerged from the analysis of documents and interview data. The first grouping
    is by jurisdiction. For the metropolitan area, the City of Omaha (hereafter, anchor
    city) is the largest city in the area that provides transportation information.
    Douglas and Sarpy Counties also provide transportation data covering other cities
    in the metropolitan area. For Council Bluffs in Iowa, as well as Pottawattamie
    County and other small cities in the same Metropolitan area, transportation data
    have been made available via the Iowa Department of Transportation website, with
    data collected locally. The vast majority of transportation data are from the
    anchor city as well as the Iowa Department of Transportation. The second grouping
    is by functions. The interview data reveal frequent correspondence and collaboration
    among IT and planning staff, particularly in the GIS area. Functional area employees
    who are directly responsible for traffic data, such as people in the engineering
    and public works departments, form another distinct group. The primary grouping
    generally follows jurisdictional lines while operating in the network and inside
    their home organizations. For instance, interviewees reported that traffic engineers
    in the anchor city see their home city as their primary obligation and traffic
    data collection as their primary responsibility. The needs of the network and
    other jurisdictions seem to be secondary. The staff in the IT department have
    no jurisdiction over the traffic employees in a separate department. From the
    perspective of data collection and sharing, such a jurisdictional divide based
    on functional areas inside a government is even more pronounced than the divide
    across governments. Relationships: trust and resource interdependence The trust
    relationship across organizational boundaries is primarily based on personal ties
    and secondarily on institutional trust. The interview data show that the highest
    level of trust is evident among people who belong to the IT and GIS community.
    The trust level is relatively lower between the technical group and the functional
    groups with regard to data quality. A trust relationship that is based on personal
    ties also suggests that individuals matter. The individual who has been the main
    GIS coordinator at MAPA seems to have the trust of the information providers gauged
    by their willingness to work with the MAPA person on various initiatives. In contrast,
    a new staff member at MAPA faces the challenge of gaining the help and support
    of information providers in other jurisdictions. MAPA depends on the participating
    governments for the collection and sharing of transportation information. MAPA
    needs traffic data on a regular basis from participating governments to develop
    a transportation improvement plan. Such information resource dependence ties MAPA
    and other participating government agencies together. Another side of resource
    interdependence is MAPA’s provision of resources to local governments. MAPA obtains
    federal funding and passes on some of these funds to major local government agencies
    on the order of $20,000–40,000 specifically for transportation data collection
    in the form of paying for staff time and technology. More broadly, MAPA provides
    resources in other areas such as community development to the same cooperating
    agencies. Such provision of resources has been recognized by the participating
    local government agencies as a major activity in trust-building. Data and technology
    Participating governments have a variety of data collection methods that create
    challenges for data integration. In the anchor city, traffic data are collected
    via manual input using hand-held devices. In other counties, the primary method
    is the use of tubes laid on the road to count the number of vehicles passing through.
    This difference in data collection methods requires calibration on the part of
    MAPA to harmonize the data and make sense of traffic counts. The variety of data
    collection methods and lack of geo-coding require MAPA to make intensive efforts
    to integrate data from various sources. With the approval of the TTAC, MAPA has
    direct control over the method and technology for data integration and analysis.
    Its main task is to convert heterogeneous data formats into a standardized geo-coded
    one in a GIS database. The technologies used for traffic data processing at the
    local governments vary significantly. The anchor city uses hand-held devices to
    enter traffic data and uploads them to a local computer. A specialized software,
    coupled with Excel, is used for traffic data processing. The counties use devices
    connected to traffic-counting tubes to gather the traffic data and upload them
    to the computers in their information system departments for data processing.
    At MAPA, the main software used to do initial processing is Excel, with the geographic
    information then added to be loaded into the ArcGIS software. The use of TransCAD
    coupled with ArcGIS helps produce the traffic-flow analysis. Stages of information
    service production and managing collaborative governance activities Workflow and
    the role of various groups The first stage of producing transportation information
    service is traffic data collection and collaboration inside a local government.
    The functional department (i.e. Public Works) plays the dominant role in collecting
    traffic data at the first stage in that it makes decisions on the method and the
    timing and frequency of data collection. The interview data suggest, however,
    that the IT departments in various local governments typically play an assisting
    role. For the anchor city government, there is minimal involvement of the IT department
    in traffic data processing. In contrast, for county governments in the metropolitan
    area, the IT departments process the collected traffic data. The second stage
    of traffic information production is data sharing across organizational boundaries.
    The main group is the data and technology staff in both MAPA and the participating
    local government. The IT department is the main point of contact for cross-boundary
    data sharing with the exception of the anchor city. MAPA makes the information
    requests and follows up with reminders. It can take between 2 and 6 months for
    MAPA to obtain traffic data from individual local governments. The third stage
    is data integration that harmonizes traffic data collected through different methods
    and definitions. MAPA does all the work while consulting with the TTAC on technical
    standards and with participating local governments on the technical details. The
    group leading this stage is the staff in MAPA’s program office that is responsible
    for data integration. The last stage is data analysis and generation of maps/reports.
    The program office of MAPA is mainly responsible for preparation of presentation
    and reports. Collaborative governance activities and their management The first
    area of collaborative governance activities is building trust and shared understanding
    as shown in Table 2. Currently, the primary way for MAPA to win the trust and
    support of participating local governments is to provide financial support for
    activities related to regional planning and transportation. The main units of
    local governments benefitting from these funds include the public works departments,
    planning departments, and GIS units. Moreover, there are regular and ad hoc meetings
    between participating governments and MAPA to cultivate trust and create a shared
    understanding. There is frequent communication among GIS and data people on technology
    needs beyond the traffic count. The interviews with MAPA staff suggest the importance
    of personal relationships in securing cooperation from the relevant departments
    in these local governments to provide transportation data. Table 2. Collaborative
    network governance dynamics and management activities. Download CSVDisplay Table
    The second area is institution-building for joint actions. The main existing agreement
    for transportation planning is between MAPA and state agencies (MAPA 2014). The
    authority of direct data collection by MAPA, however, is rather limited. An explicit
    institutional agreement is lacking between MAPA and various local governments
    in terms of setting data standards. As an effort to build institutions for joint
    action, some GIS and data personnel in MAPA and other local governments have initiated
    a conversation about traffic data standards. The third area is to build technical
    capability for joint actions. Currently, such activities focus on building GIS
    capabilities in terms of software and use. Most of the equipment money for MAPA
    and assistance to other local governments is applied to the GIS software license
    to acquire capabilities for better data quality and information interoperability
    with geo-coded data. Lastly, MAPA plays a leadership role in managing resource
    interdependence. Although the most important task for MAPA is to manage interdependence
    while collecting and sharing transportation data, MAPA faces challenges when the
    anchor city and other participating local governments utilize their own traffic
    information for their planning purposes and thus are less dependent on MAPA. But
    MAPA provides values beyond transportation data when working with both public
    works and IT/IS units to strengthen resource interdependence. The interviews reveal
    that these department and local government units see MAPA providing coordinating
    service beyond transportation data and acting as a gateway to secure and manage
    federal grants that would otherwise be unavailable to these departments and units.
    Driving the performance of the collaborative transportation data networks The
    performance of this information and decision-support network administered by MAPA
    can be measured by the efficiency and effectiveness in various components of producing
    and providing relevant service. With regard to traffic data collection, data collection
    by individual jurisdictions has proven cost-effective as they have deployed the
    least-cost approach to data collection with use of either a traffic-counting tube
    or a hand-held counting device to collect traffic information. From the network-wide
    perspective, however, the variety of data collection methods used creates issue
    later on for data integration. In terms of data integration, MAPA has only been
    able to generate high-quality data by investing significant time and resources.
    A considerable amount of time has been required for MAPA to model traffic flows
    of major roadways when the traffic count of one section of road is collected by
    one jurisdiction using one method and the other section of the road is collected
    using a different method. For data analysis and communication, the performance
    level is relatively high. Such performance is evident in the deployment of GIS
    and traffic-flow modules, as well as in MAPA’s ability to integrate traffic-flow
    information from all directions of the interaction for the entire metropolitan
    area – as well as the traffic flow of highways cutting through the metropolitan
    area. One of the challenges associated with improving network performance is the
    lack of collaboration between IT and functional units at the same local government.
    The IS/GIS interviewees – who understand the need for data standardization for
    improving data sharing, integration, and analysis – indicate their limited influence
    over the functional department people in the effort to standardize traffic data
    collection. Incentives alone are not sufficient to improve the consistency and
    quality of data at the point of data collection in a network with distributed
    authority. The resource pass-through is sufficient to cover the cost of the majority
    of data collection activities in a particular department of the local government.
    However, as the limited success in establishing a uniform data collection suggests,
    such pass-through itself is not sufficient for the development and implementation
    of common data standards. There has been strong cohesiveness and support from
    the GIS members of the collaborative data network. GIS interviewees have indicated
    their support for implementing guidance from MAPA with regard to data collection
    and standardization. These interviewees have also commented that the resource
    support from MAPA for their GIS operation is helpful. Moreover, interaction and
    communication reaches beyond just the traffic data. It covers regional planning
    that affords these GIS members of the network with regular contact and communication
    in regional planning activities, data forums, and a new aerial-mapping initiative.
    Tracing the key events in the documents suggests that having the right talents
    who understand and properly utilize technology can significantly improve efficiency
    and effectiveness of information service. That is, one of the most significant
    contributions comes from the role of the GIS specialist at MAPA. Shortly after
    joining MAPA, the GIS coordinator migrated the traffic count data from an ACCESS
    relational database to a GIS (geo-coded) database to improve efficiency and effectiveness
    of data storage and analysis. This case study suggests that technology can improve
    performance. For data integration and analysis, the enactment of appropriate technology
    by a key network staff member can significantly improve the efficiency and effectiveness.
    In addition, the potential of technical capabilities provides the needed vision
    and strategic goals for the network to further improve information service. For
    example, a cloud-based GIS portal, combined with appropriate technologies at the
    point of data collection, can significantly improve the workflow and process of
    data collection, analysis, and information dissemination. A hand-held device with
    wireless data services and accurate geo-coded traffic count could provide high-quality
    real-time traffic information to the portal. Discussion and implications The finding
    of a relatively significant jurisdictional divide between functional areas underscores
    the need to address the different priorities and interests between programme and
    IT people as articulated in the earlier literature (Kraemer et al. 1989). Such
    a divide between functional areas is probably more salient in contexts where there
    is a lack of common standards for network member organizations in data collection
    and processing. The findings from this case study suggest a different emphasis
    when common standards are lacking and the network administrative organization
    does not have the standard-setting authority – which also underscores the importance
    of fitting strategy to a particular network structure rather than applying the
    same strategy to all structures (O’Toole 2015; Provan and Kenis 2008). In terms
    of practice, the concern about divide between functional departments for improving
    cross-boundary data collection and data sharing would imply a different management
    strategy. The formulation of common standards may need to involve the heads of
    the functional departments that are directly responsible for data collection as
    well as the top executives of the examined governments. This recommendation provides
    the specifics of network management activities, especially the network member
    activation suggested by McGuire ( 2002). Moreover, for the building of institutions
    for joint action (Emerson, Nabatchi, and Balogh 2012), the findings suggest more
    attention should be given to the groups that align more with their functional
    responsibilities across the network rather than those departments within the same
    organization. Second, the limited success employing only incentives to improve
    the standardization of data collection methods is probably more pronounced in
    an existing governance structure that does not provide MPOs the authority to mandate
    data-collection methods. The findings highlight the need to tie incentives to
    guidance/requirements for the purpose of improving data quality and information
    interoperability. The need for such coupling between incentives and requirements
    advances our knowledge about network management in terms of the need for coupling
    incentives with rules rather than offering financial or technical support alone.
    This need also suggests that some level of guidance and mandate is required. Third,
    the success of building a subnetwork of GIS professionals underscores the importance
    of core areas of collaborative management activities, including regular communication
    to build trust, direct and ample incentives to win commitment to the network,
    and capacity-building for joint action. For practice, this study points to the
    need for information and decision-support networks to simultaneously pursue multiple
    areas of collaborative management activities to get results. Fourth, the finding
    that a key network manager with expert knowledge on relevant technology contributes
    to service performance improvement underscores the performance impact of combining
    human capital and appropriate technology to advance information service. The relevance
    of knowledge about technology is probably more applicable for the class of information
    and decision-support service networks. The salient role that technology and technical
    knowledge play in these types of networks suggests that knowledge about and deployment
    of appropriate technology can significantly improve the quality of service (Yang
    and Maxwell 2011). For the role of technology, this case study demonstrates that
    the appropriate use of relevant technology can significantly improve performance
    in data quality, data integration, data analysis, and visualization. Such a finding
    implies the need for elevating the importance of data and technology in driving
    performance. Moreover, discussion about the value of technology can inspire a
    network to set goals for the next level of performance. The motivating and goal-development
    aspects of technology for collaborative governance networks add nuances to our
    knowledge. Network managers can raise the importance of discussing technology
    and its potential as a way to discuss shared performance goals for the network.
    These management recommendations based on the case contribute to our understanding
    of the specifics of managing collaborative networks as related to technology.
    This study contributes to the existing network studies by directly addressing
    the role of IT in performance. For e-government studies, this finding provides
    insights into the interplay between technology and management when discussion
    about the performance-improvement potential of technology can be used as a network
    management strategy. Conclusion and opportunity for future research This article
    provides an integrated framework for managing the performance of information and
    decision-support networks. This framework integrates bodies of literature to enhance
    our understanding of the interplay among context, management, technology, and
    performance in a network setting. The proposed framework is one of the first efforts
    to integrate insights from several bodies of literature to advance the theory
    and practice of managing digital government in a cross-boundary setting. Moreover,
    this article conducts an exploratory case study, guided by the framework while
    allowing for the development of grounded theory, to explore the mechanisms by
    which the performance of an information and decision-support network can be improved.
    The findings of this exploratory study offer several points for the advancement
    of theory and practice. First, managers and researchers need to pay attention
    to the divide between functional department staff and IS/IT staff both inside
    a jurisdiction and across the network. This case shows that, especially in the
    context of a lack of authority and common technical standards, this division can
    be one of the major barriers to major improvement in data integration and service
    quality. Second, there is a need to combine incentives with guidance and standards
    to drive results. The limited success in driving performance by the provision
    of incentives without strong guidance and standards suggests such a need. Collaborative
    network management needs to build institutional capacity for joint action (common
    standards and monitoring). Third, the combination of various collaborative network
    management strategies is effective, at least as evident in the GIS subnetwork.
    Such a finding suggests the need to combine communication, incentives, and technology
    for building a collaborative network. Fourth, this case study suggests the performance-improvement
    potential of a network manager who understands and utilizes appropriate technology.
    For data-intensive information-service networks, having a tech-savvy network manager
    can be an asset to leverage technology for service improvement. Lastly, this study
    also points to the way in which technology can make a difference in service improvement.
    Conversation about the potential of technology can serve as a way to create shared
    goals and motivate network participants. The utilization of the case study approach,
    while possessing the strength of generating new insights into collaborative data
    governance, does have its limitations. The findings of this study, although instructive
    in showing some potential pathways for network success or causal mechanisms, should
    not be treated as confirmative theory testing. Future research needs to examine
    other similar networks of information and decision-support service at various
    stages of development. Moreover, the statements made are specific to information
    and decision-support networks in which IT plays an important role in service production
    and delivery. Any generalization beyond this type of network should proceed with
    further empirical investigation of other types of networks. Acknowledgements This

    such as AI-driven crop modeling, robotics, and autonomous vehicles, are seen as
    the future of agricultural efficiency and environmental sustainability. The paper
    finds that while there is growing adoption of these technologies, their integration
    with irrigation systems is crucial to fully leverage their potential. The authors
    highlight challenges in achieving seamless interoperability and standardization,
    such as differences in data formats, communication protocols, and software applications.
    They recommend solutions including common data models, open-source platforms,
    and collaboration among stakeholders to foster an integrated ecosystem.'

    Figures and tables Abstract Aim: Public health systems have embraced health informatics
    and information technology as a potential transformational tool to improve real-time
    surveillance systems, communication, and sharing of information among various
    agencies. Global pandemic outbreaks like Zika and Ebola were quickly controlled
    due to electronic surveillance systems enabling efficient information access and
    exchange. However, there is the need for a more robust technology to enhance adequate
    epidemic forecasting, data sharing, and effective communication. The purpose of
    this review was to examine the use of informatics and information technology tools
    and its impact on public health delivery. Method: Investigators searched six electronic
    databases. These were MEDLINE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature
    (CINAHL) Complete, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, COMPENDEX, Scopus,
    and Academic Search Premier from January 2000 to 31 March 2016. Results: A total
    of 60 articles met the eligibility criteria for inclusion. These studies were
    organized into three areas as (1) definition of the term public health informatics;
    (2) type of public health surveillance systems and implications for public health;
    and (3) electronic surveillance systems functionality, capability, training, and
    challenges. Our analysis revealed that due to the growing expectations to provide
    real-time response and population-centered evidence-based public health in this
    information-driven age there has been a surge in informatics and information technology
    adoption. Education and training programs are now available to equip public health
    students and professionals with skills in public health informatics. However,
    obstacles including interoperability, data standardization, privacy, and technology
    transfer persist. Conclusion: Re-engineering the delivery of public health is
    necessary to meet the demands of the 21st century and beyond. To meet this expectation,
    public health must invest in workforce development and capacity through education
    and training in informatics. Introduction The discipline of public health is tasked
    with the responsibility to protect and improve the health of communities through
    the provision of effective and efficient education, healthy lifestyles as well
    as disease and injury prevention. Based on this foundation, the field has seen
    many achievements over the years. These include the rise in life expectancy and
    reduction in maternal and infant mortality and chronic diseases like cancer, cardiovascular,
    and workplace-associated injuries. However, to effectively address public health
    challenges in today’s global economy, practitioners and researchers need reliable
    and timely information which facilitates evidence-based decision-making. In addition,
    better communication and improved information management resources/tools to track
    and analyze epidemics or threats to accelerate response for early warning systems
    are also required.1 This is necessary because the advancements in globalization
    have not only led to the faster movement of goods and services but also has created
    opportunities for the spread of diseases and other public health threats. Adequate
    preparation for these threats and events is paramount to avoid panic and safeguard
    the protection of the whole population. One way to ensure this is through the
    application of informatics and technology in public health delivery. Application
    of informatics and information technology in public health Over the last two decades,
    public health and medical care systems have embraced information technology (IT)
    as a powerful revolutionary tool for engagement, change enhancement, improvement,
    and health promotion. Public health agencies use various information systems to
    improve real-time surveillance systems, prompt effective communication of warning
    systems, data collection, and sharing of information.2,3 According to the disease
    control priorities project (DCP2) report, global pandemic outbreaks such as severe
    acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and the influenza A (H1N1) were contained through
    the application of rapid surveillance and response network systems.2,4 Despite
    these successes, there is a need for more advanced technology that focuses on
    effective collaboration among public health agencies and with other partners to
    promote adequate epidemic forecasting and communication.5 One of the goals of
    healthy people 2020 is to improve public health and strengthen the US national
    security through global disease detection, response, prevention, and control strategies.3
    Global health is important, since the health of the US population is affected
    by public health threats and events that happen across the world. Examples include
    the Zika and Ebola viruses outbreak that began in 2014, the 2009 H1N1 influenza,
    and the 2003 SARS epidemic.3 These outbreaks have shown that there are no borders
    for deadly pathogens. Moreover, the explosion in the number of emerging and re-emerging
    infectious and communicable diseases calls for investment and development of informatics
    infrastructure to facilitate swift identification, monitoring, management, and
    containment of global epidemic. As accurately argued by Duchin,6 Zika and Ebola
    have exposed the weaknesses in our public health system not only in terms of insufficient
    investment for preparedness, response to disease outbreaks, and other health threats
    but also the public health systems’ readiness and response capacity.6 In support
    of this argument, the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD)
    noted that ‘nearly everyone agrees that the way we manage health today is unsustainable’.7
    It costs more than we can afford and delivers less than we expect.7 If the current
    public health system is to flourish in the coming age of uncertain resources and
    increased demand, then it requires redesign and implementation of new systems
    that are both not sustainable and reliable in real-time.8,9 To be prepared and
    respond to outbreaks like Zika, Ebola, H1N1, SARS, and similar re-emerging diseases
    and disasters, we need to invest in the existing public health system and strengthen
    its information system infrastructure. Furthermore, Bell et al.10 noted that the
    response to the Ebola outbreak was problematic due to poor health infrastructure,
    lack of geographic and cultural familiarity with the disease, and distrust in
    government and healthcare workers. The major lessons these outbreaks are the need
    of effective systems to detect and stop infectious disease threats, stronger international
    surge capacity partnership, improving infection prevention and control in healthcare
    settings, IT systems, rigorous training of healthcare workers and scientists,
    as well as development of faster reliable laboratory tests and genetic analysis
    methods.10–12 In addition, there is the need for a well-prepared global response
    systems and action strategies that should include short-, medium-, and long-term
    plans on how to address threats and contain future epidemic outbreaks. Similarly,
    it is necessary to establish and maintain a solid foundation that consists of
    core functions for a strong public health emergency response before a crisis occurs.6
    Contingency plans should include robust surveillance and strong collaborative
    systems that enable easy communication with public health agencies and experts.6
    In addition, the use of incident management framework is paramount for health
    emergency response. As a result, public health agencies and the medical care system
    must proactively engage governmental and non-governmental stakeholders to maintain
    robust health information systems and disaster management plans along with surge
    capacity. Nonetheless, this can only be achieved through the implementation and
    availability of an operational information system. Hence, the purpose of this
    systematic review was to evaluate the development and use of informatics (public
    health informatics (PHI)), and IT tools and its impact on public health delivery.
    Methods Data sources The authors searched six major scientific electronic databases.
    The search strategy focused on issues relating to public health and informatics
    or technology use over the last decade (2000–2016). Investigators identified studies
    in MEDLINE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL)
    Complete, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, COMPENDEX, Scopus, and Academic
    Search Premier. The studies were retrieved using combinations of the following
    Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms only: public health AND informatics OR public
    health informatics AND information technology OR management information systems.
    We also systematically reviewed the reference lists of articles retrieved. The
    year of publication was limited to January 2000– 31 March 2016. The earliest publication
    date of 2000 was selected because the term ‘Public Health Informatics’ was entered
    into the MeSH during that time. Inclusion and exclusion criteria Our inclusion
    criteria were studies on the use of informatics and technology and its impact
    on public health delivery between the years 2000 and 2016. We excluded studies
    that were not published in English and those that focused solely on medical or
    healthcare delivery or health technologies such as electronic medical/health records
    (EMRs/EHRs), computerized physician order entry (CPOE), clinical decision support
    system (CDSS), and healthcare automation systems. Study selection and data extraction
    The investigators examined the titles and abstracts of the identified citations
    and applied a screening algorithm based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria
    described above. Each paper was rated as ‘relevant’ or ‘not relevant’ by the investigators.
    Next, the authors collected the following information from each ‘relevant’ article:
    objective, type of information system, impact on public health delivery, and conclusions.
    Results Since the publications of the two Institute of Medicine (IOM) reports
    To Err is Human: Building a Safer Health System and Crossing the Quality Chasm:
    A New Health System for the 21st Century, IT has been embraced as an integral
    resource for achieving quality care delivery and improvement (public health and
    medical care services). While healthcare IT is not only limited to electronic
    health records (EHRs), this systematic review revealed that most of the studies
    focused on this area and how the use of health informatics and IT is changing
    medical care or clinical decision-making. The initial comprehensive literature
    searches using the combination of keywords identified 47,523 studies. Based on
    the selection and exclusion criteria established, 60 studies remained eligible
    (see Figure 1).1,13–71 These studies were further divided into three categories:
    (1) definition of the term PHI;69 (2) type of public health surveillance (PHS)
    systems and implications for public health (23 studies);13,14,19,21–23,25,27,29,32,34,41,44,45,47–49,55,58,61,65,67,71
    and (3) electronic surveillance systems functionality, capability, training, and
    challenges (37 studies).1,15–18,20,24,26–28,30,31,33,35–40,42,43,46,50–60,62–64,66,68–70

    Systems A case study comparing three state-of-the-art syndromic surveillance systems
    A comprehensive survey of state-of-the-art syndromic surveillance research and
    system development efforts from the perspective of information science and technology
    Although syndromic surveillance systems have been developed and deployed in many
    state public health departments, there is an urgent need to create a cross-jurisdictional
    data-sharing infrastructure to maximize the potential benefit and practical impact
    of syndromic surveillance Yasnoff et al.69 Public Health Informatics (PHI) To

    help promote progress in the application of information technology to improve
    public health Yih et al.70 The National Bioterrorism Syndromic Surveillance Demonstration

    care data to identify unusual clusters of illness and support rapid public health
    follow-up Assessment of the National Bioterrorism Syndromic Surveillance Demonstration
    Program Data files created by this system are also directly usable by health departments
    and are compatible with the emerging standards of CDC’s BioSense initiative. This
    allows healthcare organizations to make their data directly available to local
    and national health agencies if they so choose Definition of the term PHI The
    term PHI was defined in 1995 by Friede et al.,72 and also Yasnoff et al.69 in
    2000 as the systematic application of information and computer science and technology
    to public health practice, research, and learning.69,72 The term was formally
    entered into the MeSH in 2003. Since then, PHI has evolved as a specialized discipline
    within public health with a focus on the use of informatics and IT to engage communities
    and individuals in behavioral, socio-cultural, and environmental lifestyle changes
    to promote health and wellbeing.69,72 In addition, the growing expectations to
    provide population-centered public health delivery, have led to increasing adoption
    of informatics and IT systems to provide faster and more efficient services. This
    push has also created a need for public health to place a high priority on the
    development and applications of new technologies to facilitate evidence-based
    public health delivery along with effective and efficient management of health
    programs and project.73 Type of PHS systems and implications for public health
    Informatics and IT tools have the potential to influence almost every aspect of
    the public health sector. Telemedicine and rapid syndromic surveillance systems
    are used to improve access to health services, quality of care, overall quality,
    and wellbeing of the community.1,13–15,17–19,21–30,32–59,62–71,74 These benefits
    notwithstanding, public health, like the medical care sector, has lagged behind
    the banking and aviation industries, in the adoption of IT.75 However, since the
    establishment of the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information
    Technology, by the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services in April 2004, to
    promote health IT, the field of public health has undergone a lot of transformation.75
    For instance, over the last decade, numerous investments have been made in IT
    surveillance systems to support public health management. Boom et al.13 examined
    the Houston – Harris county immunization information system (IIS) after Hurricane
    Katrina. They reported that the ability to link the registry to the Louisiana
    immunization network immediately after the disaster enabled a reduction in the
    duplication of immunization administered to children resulting in a cost saving
    of over US$26.5 million. In addition, the IIS backup systems prevented the distraction
    of all medical charts and enabled providers in Houston, Texas, and Louisiana,
    to deliver efficient and effective care to children and their parents. Due to
    the success of the IIS, Michigan Care Improvement Registry added hazard module
    functionalities to capture medication and mass immunization during an epidemic.13
    Using public health England emergency department syndromic surveillance system
    (EDSSS), Hughes et al.32 investigated the factors contributing to respiratory
    pathogens and emergency room attendance. Results revealed that the EDSSS provides
    real-time better early warning activity than laboratory surveillance. Findings
    also highlight the need to triangulate laboratory surveillance systems with the
    EDSSS to increase monitoring, planning, and response to acute emergency room services.32
    Similarly, Derby et al.19 evaluated the Arizona Poison and Drug Information Center
    (APDIC) database to assess its ability to improve foodborne disease outbreaks
    (FBDOs). After analyzing 68,433 suspected foodborne calls, of which 2922 were
    suspected of human exposure from Pima County, they concluded that although the
    APDIC helped to avoid duplication of cases reported, the system is limited in
    its ability to provide real-time foodborne illness data19 (See Table 1). The traditional
    PHS systems continue to play a tremendous role by enabling public health sector
    to detect and respond to outbreaks. Nonetheless, to meet the public health demands
    and needs in today’s information age, new surveillance systems are necessary.76
    As a result, to strengthen health promotion and disease prevention, state and
    local public health departments are collaborating with health agencies, organizations,
    and institutions around the world to implement various forms of integrated automated/electronic
    surveillance systems to effectively track and detect diseases, disasters, and
    other bioterrorism attacks. For example, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control
    and Prevention (CDC) in conjunction with the Department of Homeland Security have
    developed the BioSense and other information systems to coordinate disaster response
    among federal, state, and local public health agencies.14,44,47,48 Since its implementation,
    these systems have helped detect, monitor, report, and evaluate many public health
    incidents (Table 1). These include respiratory problems associated with the southern
    California wildfires, gastrointestinal disease outbreak at a U.S. Department of
    Defense base, rash illness among elementary school students, as well as other
    communicable and waterborne outbreaks (Table 1).22,23,44,48,55,77 Table 3 provides
    further examples of syndromic surveillance systems currently in use around the
    world for public health threats.13,14,34,44,62,68,78–81 Table 3 Examples of global

    surveillance systems functionality, capability, training, and challenges Well-developed
    and functioning IT systems have the potential to help public health officials
    make timely decisions during any disaster. It is crucial that surveillance systems
    are designed to provide public health personnel with the needed skills to predict,
    detect, manage, communicate, and disseminate outbreak information among all agencies
    and decision-makers (Table 2). Buckeridge and collegues16,17 evaluated the algorithms
    of the bio-event advanced indicator recognition technology (BioALIRT) and the
    simulation model of the anthrax epidemic injection in Norfolk, Virginia. The authors
    reported that both the BioALIRT and the anthrax systems accurately improve the
    timeliness of outbreak detection and progression of the disease, but it lacks
    the ability to successfully track movement across different locations (Table 2).16,17
    Similarly, Heisey-Grove et al.30 examined the impact of PHI in enhancing the Massachusetts
    hepatitis C surveillance reporting system. According to the authors, more than
    8000 new cases of hepatitis C are reported annually. Prior to the implementation
    of the new system, local health departments (LHDs) had to manually complete a
    four-page case-report form, which took at least 7 min to complete. However, the
    implementation of the Massachusetts virtual epidemiologic network (MAVEN) Web-based
    system resulted in timeliness of hepatitis C reporting.30 Henao et al.31 analyzed
    CDC’s 10 state health departments’ FoodNet surveillance system and concluded that
    though the system has helped improve food safety in the US, it is also critical
    to ensure rapid access to clinical data and facilitate surveillance and epidemiologic
    research informatics capacity such as geographic information system linkage. The
    electronic surveillance system early notification of community-based epidemics
    (ESSENCE) was developed to track higher-than-expected visits to the emergency
    room, and sale of pharmaceutical products.33 Analysis of the system by Hurt-Mullen
    and Coberly33 revealed that the longitudinal data collected enable epidemiologist
    to identify hotspots for community outbreaks. Nonetheless, continuous modification
    of the system is needed to distinguish between important public events requiring
    urgent attention and statistical anomalies (false alarms).33 The next important
    issue is public health information system architectural design and capability.24,38,40,43,46,50,51,53,54,59,60,70
    Mirhaji,46 Ortega et al.,50 Reeder et al.,51 and Yih et al.70 examined the state
    of electronic PHS conceptualization, design, analysis, and implementation in the
    US and concluded that the evolution of the Internet has tremendously changed public
    health delivery. However, due to the complexity of PHS data collection, electronic
    surveillance systems should be designed to enable reusing data and sharing. Another
    development is a surge in the number of public health schools and programs providing
    professional-level educational degrees from bachelor to Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)
    and Doctor of Public Health (DrPH). This has also led to changes in entry requirements,
    core competencies in learning, practice, and teaching for schools of public health
    and programs.69 To meet the 21st century needs, demands, and characteristics of
    the population some scholars have argued public health programs must include courses
    in informatics.1,36,37,39,69 Yasnoff et al.,1,69 noted that ‘the need for new
    and improved information systems for public health is growing because of new challenges
    related to antibiotic-resistance, emerging infections, and chemical and biological
    terrorism’.69 Consequently, the authors suggested that public health professionals
    should have deeper skills and knowledge in informatics to effectively make the
    appropriate decision concerning PHS systems development and management.1,69 Others
    argued that public health agencies should collaborate with educational and training
    institutions to coordinate development of tailored informatics competencies (continuing
    education) for current professionals to reflect technological changes.36,69,82–85
    This training should meet variety of needs ranging from basic informatics skills
    for current and future professionals to a more specialized informatics and information
    system management skills.1,86 Currently, the delivery of PHI education and training
    varies from short-term in-service training to long-term academic education including
    certificates, diplomas, first degrees, graduate degrees, and post-graduate training.1,69
    Again, Yasnoff et al.,69 Norris and Brittain,86 commented that the mode of these
    training programs varies greatly depending on the individual or organization’s
    education and or training requirements.69,86 The CDC PHI fellowship-training program
    established in the mid-1990s continues to evolve. The main goal of this 2-year
    program is to provide training and experience to public health professionals in
    applying computer and information science skills to real public health problems.1,69
    The training also provides fellows the opportunity to work with experienced mentors
    in the field of PHI, thereby enhancing their understanding of global health issues,
    learn development of effective partnerships, and improving the health of poor
    communities through the application of health informatics and IT1,69 (See Table
    2). Effective and efficient public health delivery can be sustained only on readily
    available IT. Real-time response to natural disasters and those due to bioterrorists
    require a well-equipped integrated information system. Despite the benefits of
    health informatics and IT, there are obstacles to consider during the design and
    implementation of such system. One of such issues is implementing interoperable
    and reusable systems.51 While some believe costs associated with hardware and
    software acquisition are no longer an issue,84,85 system and data standardization
    remain a problem.69,85 Standardization can lead to design and development costs
    reduction, increase integration, and facilitate the collection of meaningful aggregate
    data for quality improvement necessary for policy development.69,87,88 However,
    due to complexity, diversity, and needs of each public health unit and agency,
    maintaining technological standards has become more difficult. Another challenge
    is data and information sharing across organizational and jurisdictional boundaries.36,39,43,68,85
    Historically and following the example of the medical system, public health agencies
    have designed information systems that are often maintained in many different
    forms and incompatible. This has resulted in duplicative and fragmented systems
    that hindered the ability of allied public health officials to access them.37,69
    Interoperable information systems for both routine and emergency functions such
    as biosurveillance, outbreak management, and electronic laboratory reporting are
    essential to public health work and practices. Interoperable information systems
    are also critical because the capability to exchange information across, and among
    organizations will lead to early detection, faster response times, and early intervention
    to improve the public’s health during any disaster.68 Ethical and procedural issues
    for managing and safeguarding public health data also need consideration. IT is
    perceived as a double-edged sword. Thus, whatever is done to make integrated,
    comprehensive information system more easily available for laudable and worthwhile
    purposes is likely to create new opportunities for misuse.69,85 The currently
    available public use data and statistics can play an increasingly important role
    in advancing progress on major public health threats. As noted by Bell et al.10,
    surveillance data are often collected without informed consent. These issues can
    be safeguarded through the use of ethical research frameworks, adequate design
    and support of PHS systems and responsible access control.89 It is important that
    adequate security measures are put in place to maintain data and information security
    and confidentiality, to prevent any form of breach and to reassure the public
    that their information is safe (Table 2).1,37,39 Discussion Public health is the
    science and art of preventing disease, prolonging life, and promoting health through
    the organized efforts and informed choices of society, communities, and individuals.
    The focus is to prevent injuries, outbreaks, and diseases through surveillance
    of cases and the promotion of healthy behaviors.90 Within this function is prevention
    as a primary goal for improving population health and quality of life through
    collaboration with different agencies and organizations to facilitate development
    of policies and programs to optimize interventions for healthy community.37 Hence,
    availability of and access to ‘up-to-date’ robust information system is crucial
    to public health practice, services, and delivery. It is obvious that the traditional
    paper-based surveillance systems are not efficient in providing timely information
    for public health action. Health informatics and IT system provide transformational
    tool to ensure efficient information access and exchange. Over the last two decades,
    public health, and the medical care systems have invested increasingly in IT and
    communication systems. Globally syndromic surveillance and biosurveillance systems
    are being developed and implemented (see Table 3). For example, the Pennsylvania
    Electronic Disease Surveillance System was used to track and isolate Salmonella
    quickly.80 Benefits derived from the implementation of a well-functioning health
    information and IT systems include better communication and collaboration across
    all public health and clinical specialties, prompt access to accurate clinical
    and demographic information, and reduction or prevention of human errors for automated
    processes.87,88 Despite these benefits, certain areas represent grand challenges
    for public health practice and delivery. These include the development of coherent
    integrated national public health information systems, integration between public
    health and clinical care and pervasive concerns about the impact of IT on confidentiality
    and privacy. To encourage data harmonization, documentation, and investigation,
    rigorous system standardization should also be considered.37,69,76 According to
    Lumpkin,91 federal and state public health information systems in the US have
    been developed in three ‘waves’.91 The first wave began with the independent development
    of state and federal systems that could not exchange data. The second wave was
    supported by federal funding to develop state-level systems capable of exchanging
    data using standards in building independent – and therefore costly – state systems.
    The last wave focused on reducing costs through the integration of ‘the benefits
    of state-level system development with the tools of software reuse’ and a requirement
    that ‘each system that is developed must be standard based’.91 As the use of informatics
    and PHI grow, strategies must be put in place toward a reusable design of information
    systems to promote technology transfer, and effective functioning of public health
    agencies, and the health system as a whole.51 This means public health, as a field
    and discipline of focus, should encourage and demand high-quality informatics
    education and training systems with a focus on building recognition of the importance
    of informatics. The goal of public health education should be the preparation
    of students for the future, by creating an environment that supports the teaching
    of PHI, competencies, and skills necessary for the future. Limitations of the
    review Several limitations are associated with this study. To start with, the
    review was limited to only studies published in the English language. This means,
    we might have excluded potential articles that were indexed in other languages
    or not available in the electronic databases searched. We assumed this explains
    why the majority of the eligible studies included in the review were conducted
    in the US. In addition, the published date was limited from January 2000 to 31
    March 2016. Because the field encompasses many areas and is very interdisciplinary
    in nature, it is not possible to review without bias. Despite these limitations,
    this review has drawn attention to how informatics/technology has helped address
    some of the major issues and challenges in public health for the last two decades.
    In addition, this review has revealed the importance and crucial role health informatics
    and IT are playing to reshape public health delivery to ensure a healthy society.
    Conclusion To the best of our knowledge, this is the first evidence-based systematic
    review of the literature solely dedicated to the role of informatics and IT and
    its impact on public health delivery. Through a comprehensive literature search,
    the authors identified 60 articles. This review provides an in-depth overview
    of how public health agencies are using informatics and technology, benefits,
    challenges, and opportunities. There is no doubt that to most effectively serve
    and improve communities’ health in this information age and beyond, requires a
    strong PHI infrastructure. To meet this expectation, public health must invest
    in workforce development and capacity through education and training in PHI. As
    noted by the IOM’s Committee on Quality Healthcare in America, ‘information technology
    must play a central role in the redesign of the healthcare system if a substantial
    improvement in quality is to be achieved in the coming decade’.92 As a result,
    re-engineering public health courses, learning competencies, skills, and practices
    represents the next phase in public health.73,76 Ethical Approval This study is
    a systematic review that involves no human or animal subjects. Therefore, no ethical
    approval was pursued. Conflict of Interest The author(s) declared no potential

  explanation: This study found a range of benefits and risks associated with smart
    home technology (SHT), as well as recommendations for more sustainable SHT development
    and deployment across social, environmental, political, and technical dimensions.
  extract_1: Our respondents did not discuss only benefits and barriers and risks,
    but also 11 policy changes that need implemented to make smart homes more sustainable.
    Table 6 offers a summary of these suggested policies. Taken together, these polices
    would promote more sustainable smart home development and deployment across social,
    environmental, political, and technical dimensions.
  extract_2: By far the most strongly suggested policy recommendation was the need
    for better consumer protection, privacy, and data security.

    degree of digitally connected, automated, or enhanced services to building occupants.
    Smart homes have become central in recent technology and policy discussions about
    energy efficiency, climate change, and the sustainability of buildings. Nevertheless,
    do they truly promote sustainability goals? In addition, what sorts of benefits,
    risks, and policies do they entail? Based on an extensive original dataset involving
    expert interviews, site visits to retailers, and a comprehensive review of the
    literature, this study critically examines the promise and peril of smart home
    technologies. Drawing on original data collected in the United Kingdom, which
    has access to European markets, the study first examines definitions of smart
    homes before offering a new classification involving 13 categories of smart technology
    covering 267 specific options commercially available from 113 companies. It situates
    these different technology classes alongside six degrees or levels of smartness,
    from the basic or traditional home to the fully automated and sentient home. It
    then elaborates on the 13 distinct benefits smart homes may offer alongside potential
    17 risks and barriers, before introducing seven policy recommendations from the
    material. It lastly suggests three areas of future research on the demographics
    and behavior of actual smart home adopters, rethinking the duality of “control,”
    and looking beyond “homes” towards socio-technical systems, practices, and justice.

    Systems 1. Introduction Smart home technologies refer to devices that provide
    some degree of digitally connected or enhanced services to occupants [1], and
    are often synonymous with “home automation systems [2].” Smart homes have become
    central in recent technology and policy discussions about energy efficiency, climate
    change, and innovation (to name a few). For example, multiple studies emphasize
    the criticality of smart home technologies for achieving “net energy buildings,”
    “zero energy buildings [3],” and “life cycle zero energy buildings [4].” Others
    talk about the necessity of moving building stock towards “home automation” and
    “intelligent systems” to reduce resource use [5]. “Smart homes” are one of the
    ten pillars in the European Union''s action areas for strategic investments in
    energy [6]. In the United Kingdom, the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets emphasizes
    that “smart homes and businesses” are key to their plans to achieve the further
    decarbonisation of electricity as well as integrate more substantive demand response
    programs [7]. Forecasts therefore suggest that the smart home technology market
    will grow substantially, and that they could become a defining factor of future
    energy transitions [[8], [9], [10]]. Indeed, Jungwoo et al. already estimate that
    smart home technologies had diffused to 7.5% of households globally and generated
    expected revenues of $44.2 billion in 2018 [11]. Market analysts Berg Insight
    estimate that at the end of 2017 there were 22.5 million smart homes in Europe
    alone, or 9.9% of European households [12]. They forecast a growth of ~30% a year,
    or 84 million smart homes by 2022, with France, Germany, and the United Kingdom
    leading the European market [13]. David et al. similarly predict that by 2020,
    35% of all households in North America and 20% of households in Europe could be
    classified as smart homes [14]. In the United Kingdom alone, the country''s Industrial
    Strategy talks about smart systems with an explicit policy to boost digital infrastructure
    “with over £1 billion of public investment [15]”. The Clean Growth plan refers
    to smart systems as an elemental part of low-carbon growth, and lists government
    investments in clean technology RD&D, including £265 million for smart systems
    and £184 million in homes (including heat and energy efficiency) [16]. In addition,
    smart homes understandably are discussed as core elements within efforts to promote
    smart grids and smart cities [17]. They are lastly impacting the way we even talk
    about homes and the future, with new linguistic terms emerging to classify new
    forms of smartness. The industry has created a new word, “pleasance,” to underscore
    how smart homes can blend convenience and pleasure in ways to enhance feelings
    of comfort, peace of mind, and even romance [1]. Schill et al. add that smart
    home technologies are often adopted for such non-functional and non-utilitarian
    benefits such as symbolizing wealth, altruism, or a commitment to sustainability
    [18]. However, in this study, we critically examine the potential perils of smart
    home technologies alongside their promise, together with a broader range of sustainability
    dimensions, emphasizing not only energy and climate attributes but also issues
    related to privacy, trust, demographics, politics, and socio-technical systems.
    We utilized a mixed methods, rigorous research design to examine the types of
    smart home technologies currently available on the market in the United Kingdom,
    which has access to European suppliers, as well as to assess the benefits, risks,
    and complexities associated with smart home technology adoption. We collected
    primary data from 31 formal semi-structured research interviews with experts across
    six types of institutions, as well as structured site visits to 37 retail smart
    home technology providers across Bristol, Brighton, the greater London area, and
    Manchester in the United Kingdom. We supplemented this with an interdisciplinary
    review of the recent academic and policy literature on smart homes. Our core contribution,
    apart from offering a remarkably up to date classification to the state of smart
    home technology development in Europe, is to also emphasize the social, cultural,
    behavioral, and even political dimensions of smart homes alongside technical and
    economic ones. In their recent systematic review of the smart homes academic literature,
    Marikyan et al. caution that “The literature predominantly focuses on the technical
    characteristics of smart homes, which means that there is a need for the adoption
    of the user perspective in research on the development of technologies [19].”
    Other reviews of the smart homes literature [20,21] or the smart mobility literature
    [22,23], find that most of it consists of technical studies focused on control
    and security, and such reviews call for a better understanding how adopters might
    use or otherwise interact with smart homes. We agree and designed our study to
    explicitly address this gap. Finally, our study offers concrete smart home policy
    recommendations for Europe, and elsewhere, and it also points to future research
    gaps and agendas. 2. Research design: expert interviews, retailer visits, and
    a critical literature review Our two primary methods of data collection for the
    study were expert research interviews and site visits to retailers, complemented
    with a review of the academic literature. The authors conducted semi-structured
    qualitative expert interviews. Our sampling strategy was purposive and designed
    to include experts from six different types of institutions: • Government, including
    national ministries such as the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy
    (BEIS) and Ofgem as well as local government such as Bristol City Council; • Academic
    institutions such as the University of East Anglia, Oxford University, Loughborough,
    and Nottingham; • Private sector firms including energy suppliers such as Engie
    and NPower as well as software and technology companies such as Amazon and Microsoft;
    • Civil society and independent research institutes such as Citizens Advice, the
    Green Alliance, Energy Systems Catapult, and Price Waterhouse Coopers; • Industry
    and trade groups such as Smart Energy GB and the Alliance for Decentralized Energy;
    • Intergovernmental organizations such as the European Commission and the International
    Energy Agency. We conducted these interviews with 31 participants from November
    2018 to February 2019. Although the bulk of our interviews were done in the UK,
    we still focused broadly on the commercial availability and viability of smart
    home technologies here in Europe. The research interviews generally lasted between
    thirty and 90 min, and participants were asked “What technologies, applications,
    services or options for smart home technologies (SHTs) are available here in the
    UK and Europe?” “What are their biggest benefits?” “What are their biggest barriers?”
    “What policy recommendations do you suggest?” All interviews were treated as anonymous
    to encourage candor and also protect respondents, although each was given a respondent
    number shown in Table 1. Most interviews were recorded so that transcriptions
    and statements could be checked for accuracy. After collection of the interview
    data, each interview was subsequently fully transcribed, and then coded. Our coding
    scheme was exhaustive and inductive, meaning we coded every response and then
    analyzed the full sample inductively. Table 1. Summary of qualitative semi-structured

    site visits to retailers offering smart home technologies for sale on the market.
    We visited prominent retailers including: • Direct suppliers of smart home technology
    such as the Apple Store, Samsung Store, O2 Store, and Vodaphone Shop; • Do-It-Yourself
    (DIY) and home improvement stores such as IKEA, HomeBase and B&Q; • General department
    stores or furniture shops with major smart home technologies on offer, such as
    Peter Jones, John Lewis, and the Conran Shop; • Home electronics and household
    appliance retail stores such as Curry''s PC World and the Carphone Warehouse.
    We conducted visits to 37 of these retailers in January and February 2019 across
    eight Boroughs in the Greater London Area (Barnet, Brent, Camden, Croydon, Kensington
    and Chelsea, Hammersmith and Fulham, Newham, and Westminster) as well as Bristol,
    Brighton and Hove, and Manchester (see Fig. 1). These store visits, which lasted
    between 30 and 60 min each, had numerous advantages over merely looking at store
    catalogues or online websites. We were able to conduct additional short interviews
    and discussions with staff at the store, see what was commercially available and
    in stock (see Fig. 2), and also see how items were displayed, promoted, and in
    some cases discounted. Nonetheless, although we visited a diverse number of retail
    firms, our sample was not exhaustive as it did not include others such as system
    integrators, consultants, building specialists or online sellers that are also
    a large part of the smart home market. Download : Download high-res image (363KB)

    from the interviews and site visits, and also to better situate it within the
    body of growing research, we lastly conducted an interdisciplinary literature
    review of smart home technologies studies published within the past twenty years
    (i.e., from 2000 to 2019). We searched the Scopus and Science Direct databases
    for terms such as “smart homes,” “smart home technologies,” “smart home services,”
    “smart buildings,” “smart living environments,” “zero energy buildings,” and “automated
    homes” as well as phrases such as “electricity,” “gas,” “heat,” “mobility,” “benefits,”
    “barriers,” “risks,” “business models,” “policy,” “users,” and “practices.” The
    resulting corpus of approximately seventy studies is cited throughout this study
    to help situate our findings within the literature. 3. Historicizing, defining
    and conceptualizing smart home technologies Smart home technologies have a much
    longer history than many may realize. The germination of an idea of homes that
    could be smarter in the comfort and convenience they provide can be traced back
    at least to the 1890s and early 1900s, when wealthy people used the introduction
    of electricity to create homes with greater degrees of automation and levels of
    luxury, relaxation, and indulgence [20]. As Fig. 3 reveals, Thomas Edison himself
    patented automated, colored lighting for homes as early as 1910, used later that
    year to promote public advertising for New York Edison. Similarly, the Rural Electrification
    Administration in the United States actively promoted during the 1930s an array
    of “modern” electric appliances to go hand in hand with efforts to electrify rural
    farms. General Electric and Westinghouse launched the “Live Better Electrically”
    campaign in 1956, efforts that awarded homes a gold medallion if they converted
    all of their appliances to electricity. Download : Download high-res image (1MB)

    by the authors Since the 1990s and 2000s, smart homes have again arisen as cornerstones
    of making homes both more efficient (and lower in terms of energy consumption
    or carbon emissions) as well as more pleasurable and enjoyable. Table 2 offers
    a collection of 11 definitions of a “smart home” dating back to 1992, from Lutolf''s
    notion that it involves common information and communications systems, to Marikyan
    et al.‘s notion it involves state of the art technology that will offer tailored
    services to end users. Indeed, Appendix I supplements this discussion with 31
    other definitions offered by our expert interview respondents. Alongside these
    definitions, a range of diffuse terms have arisen to describe smart homes, including
    “smart home services” and household “internet of things” [24] “intelligent electronic
    devices” and “home and building automation,” [25] “private homes based on information
    and communication technologies (ICT)” [26] and even “non-stereotypical homes”
    for “human-computer interaction [27].” Table 2. Eleven prominent definitions of
    smart home technologies, 1992 to 2019. Source Date Definition Lutolf [28] 1992

    2019 A residence equipped with smart technologies aimed at providing tailored
    services for users Admittedly, much incoherence and definitional slippage exists
    within the literature. As R2 noted in our interviews, “There is a lot of definitional
    confusion over what a smart home is or what counts as SHTs. Some people think
    smart phones, some narrowly on smart energy.” This point was also raised by R5:
    “It is a bit of a grey area.” That said, modern SHTs seem to possess at least
    three core attributes. They enable a greater degree of control or functionality
    via monitoring and sensor interfaces [35]. They are networked or layered, connecting
    different technological features in a way to optimize service delivery and or
    performance [31]. In other terms, they layer together energy systems, digital
    systems, information systems, Internet of Things, data sharing, and even non-digital
    infrastructure [36]. They finally can empower, enabling or facilitating users
    changing their behavior, or doing things they could not do before. Smart home
    technologies can also lead to, or reflect, very different conceptions of what
    a home is for. It challenges or expands the very meaning of a home [[37], [38],
    [39], [40]]. Gram-Hanssen and Darby for example distinguish four very different
    conceptions of a home—a controlled and secured space, a site of activity and practices,
    a place for relationships and continuity, an expression of identity and values—and
    how this maps onto four very different schools of conceptual, technical, prospective,
    and evaluative smart home research [20]. Hargreaves, Wilson and colleagues differentiate
    between functional, instrumental, and socio-technical views of a smart home, with
    each leading to different views of what a smart home is and does, shown in Table
    3. As we will see later, our benefits and barriers cut across these different
    views and dimensions. Table 3. Functional, instrumental, and socio-technical views

    of smartness Our empirical material—collected via the expert interviews, retailer
    visits, and literature review—identified a staggering and surprising number of
    smart home technology options available on the market in early 2019. As Fig. 4
    reveals, we noted 267 different technologies commercially available across the
    13 categories of household appliances, lighting, energy and utilities, entertainment,
    health and wellness, safety and security, baby and pet monitors, clothes and accessories,
    vehicles and drones, home robots, gardening, integrated solutions, and “others”.
    These were provided by 113 different companies, literally from ADT to Zipato,
    although many Fortune 500 companies were involved in well, including Apple, Amazon,
    Microsoft and Google as well as Nissan, Nike, Sony, Garmin, Samsung, Siemens and
    Philips. The full list of all 267 options is offered in Appendix II. Although
    this number may seem vast, it is similar in size to the 313 home energy management
    products identified and analyzed by Ford et al. [41]. Download : Download high-res

    options available in Europe, 2019. Source: Authors As Appendix III reveals, this
    fecundity of options was not an isolated occurrence. During our shop visits, 23
    shops had at least four different categories of smart home technologies available,
    and six shops had 10 classes or more of smart home technologies available. In
    terms of the categories of smart home technologies most available, 29 shops (of
    the 37) had smart safety and security devices, 27 shops integrated solutions,
    27 shops smart clothing and accessories and 25 shops smart lighting. Even the
    two classes of least frequently available smart home technology options, baby
    and pet monitors as well as gardening, were still present in 5 of the shops. Not
    all of these smart home technology options have the same level of smartness. Instead,
    our material suggested there were degrees of smartness. Marikyan et al. [19] for
    example identify a spectrum of smart home types, from moving between a “traditional
    home” up to a “fully smart one.” As we suggest in Fig. 5, a “dumb,” “basic,” or
    “analogue home,” at level zero, has no smart home technologies. A level 1 home
    has a few smart home devices, such as a television or baby monitor or a solar
    photovoltaic (PV) system, and perhaps basic levels of feedback, but occupants
    still decide in an analogue way how to engage, and the technologies are not interconnected
    and remain in silos. Download : Download high-res image (806KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 5. Levels of smartness with smart home technologies. Source:
    Authors A level 2 home starts to see technologies bundled together and integrated
    to better provide some household services, such as heat (perhaps a smart meter
    with in-home display plus heat pump and advanced thermometer) or entertainment
    (perhaps a smart TV coupled with an internet router, audio sound system, laptop,
    and mobile phone). A level 3 home moves towards some degree of greater automation,
    with systems beginning to interconnect and even anticipate certain needs, such
    as turning lights or appliances on a few moments before an occupant returns home.
    A level 3 home can also be programmed to meet certain preferences across multiple
    devices, including different temperatures in different rooms. A level 4 home sees
    systems begin to actually learn for themselves and adapt their provision of services
    to context, i.e. turning the lights on if a storm is coming, or turning them back
    off when the sun comes out. It is at this level where sensors and monitors can
    enable technology to know the conditions of the home, and feedback loops can facilitate
    some learning so it becomes more autonomous and can adapt to what it thinks you
    want. A level 5 home becomes almost sentient, and can automatically meet and even
    anticipate all household needs. At this highest level, monitoring, feedback and
    learning coalesce across multiple integrated systems (heating, lighting, gardening,
    mobility) so that the house itself can seamlessly provide services. Homes at this
    level would most likely start talking to occupants, and also perhaps each other.
    This would be an “artificially intelligent” home or one that is “fully smart.”
    One salesperson we visited at John Lewis joked that at this level, “We will not
    do anything in a couple of years, these appliances will do everything for us!”
    A level 5 home thus moves beyond mere smart control or smart automation to smart
    home sentience. Within the literature, designers are even discussing how smart
    homes can become integrated into virtual reality so that the empirical and physical
    world merges with what they have termed “substitutional reality [42].” This would
    blend smart home sentience with an ability to create entire virtual worlds and
    realities. Some respondents discussed a possible sixth level, beyond that of a
    single home, of smart neighbourhoods, communities, and cities. These would be
    comprised of interconnected level 5 smart homes with complex baskets of interconnected
    smart home technologies. As R12 noted, “this level goes beyond the house or mere
    smart kit to the true smart grid or smart society.” We will return to this level
    in our section on a future research agenda. 5. Contextualizing the potential benefits
    of smart home technologies Our material culminated in at least 13 different types
    of benefits smart home technologies can offer households, businesses, or society.
    Table 4 offers a frequency analysis of these 13 benefits across our interviews,
    with the most popular being energy savings, convenience and controllability, and
    financial benefits. Admittedly, this list of benefits blends together realistic,
    observable and more near-term benefits with those that are more distant, hopeful,
    and long-term. Nonetheless, in doing so, it certainly expands upon the exiting
    literature on benefits. Balta-Ozkan for example classified only seven types of
    benefits across the three classes of energy consumption, safety, and lifestyle
    support [31]; the systematic review from Marikyan et al. identified only five
    classes of benefits (comfort, monitoring, health, and support, consultancy) [19];
    Hargreaves et al. identified four distinct motivations to adopt smart homes in
    their work: saving energy, interest in new technology, protecting the environment,
    and a desire for improved control [43]; Gram-Hanssen and Darby argue that the
    two areas of greatest interest are “health care” and “energy consumption of management
    [20]”. Table 4. Thirteen smart home technology benefits discussed by expert interview

    The most prominent benefit mentioned was the ability for smart home technologies
    to better manage energy services or reduce energy consumption. This relates partly
    to how inefficient the building stock is in Europe, especially the United Kingdom.
    For instance, one survey of 21,900 homes in England noted that 98% had a gas boiler
    for central heating (so no heat pumps or district heating) and that these had
    only simple controls such as an on/off switch or a timer [44]. It also noted that
    heating density plots show that people just leave heating on all the time from
    morning to night. Similar evidence from the government suggested that of the 95%
    of all United Kingdom homes that have a boiler, 800,000 have no controls at all,
    and almost 8 million have no room thermostat [45]. This could explain why space
    heating and hot water is responsible for 75% of domestic energy consumption [45].
    Thus, as R2 noted, “the biggest or best potential for smart home technologies
    relates to reducing energy demand and better demand management.” As one example,
    trials of smart heating controls alone suggest they could save something like
    a 5–7% annual reduction in household energy consumption [46]. R15 added, “Controlling
    energy and awareness of how much energy houses are using is a key benefit, as
    it creates opportunities to save, reduce, or optimize when you use energy." R31
    mentioned how in market surveys they have undertaken, “half of people they interviewed
    who had a pet heated their house all day, to keep pets warm, when veterinary associations
    indicate this is not needed. This is a massive waste of energy that smart devices
    can address.” An equally prominent benefit was improved convenience and controllability
    over a household. As R2 put it, “many smart home technologies aren''t about saving
    energy, they are about convenience and controllability, hence this interest in
    voice control such as Alexa, and such technologies make life easier, more fun,
    and more interesting.” R12 added, “The most important benefit for most people
    is the comfort, convenience and control that smart home technologies can offer.”
    R23 mentioned “Anything that make consumers life simpler is a benefit, anything
    that helps them reduce their mental load on tasks” whilst R13 mentioned on a similar
    way that: “Anything that makes you more comfortable and easier for you to get
    the outcome you want without having to consciously think about how to achieve
    that outcome.” Financial benefits such as saving money came third, and include
    the ability for households to better monitor spending and also switch to better
    tariffs and cheaper service providers. As R13 stated, “from an energy standpoint,
    even in general terms, positive outcomes can be becoming more consciously connected
    and aware in ways that save you money.” With this in mind, R11 suggested that
    “smart homes should increase the engagement of the consumer with different markets.
    That has huge potential savings for the customers”. The fourth most mentioned
    benefit for SHTs was system benefits for grid operators, with R15 commenting that
    “the industry benefits from smart home technologies through better data and no
    longer needing to do manual meter readings.” In terms of automation and efficiency,
    R22 said “This could also have benefits for the systems operators, it could be
    the distributors or the national system operators, and they have the benefit to
    balance supply and demand with greater control … this could allow them to come
    up with complete new business models and service offering”. R28 stated that “There
    are benefits for the electricity grid too, you can better manage demand and then
    you have better data which allows you to better control power stations”. R27 pinpointed
    how smart home technologies could enhance services: “indeed, smart homes are becoming
    more useful because the datasets are getting bigger, the algorithms are getting
    better and therefore, some companies are learning lots on behavior. Which allows
    them to optimize and to provide better services”. Environmental benefits included
    displaced carbon, pollution, or waste, achieved through a mix of better monitoring,
    better energy management systems, and greater control over the sources of domestic
    carbon emissions. Energy savings are predicted as remotely accessible apps and
    displays raise household awareness of their energy consumption and allow them
    response from a distance, and allow for real-time notifications. In addition,
    data analytics could allow urban planners, utility companies and architects to
    understand demand patterns for better planning and maintenance. The Accenture
    report, which was produced for Global e-Sustainability Initiative (GeSI) – a global
    ICT industry association - estimates that ICT avoided emissions are equivalent
    to 9.7 times the ICT sector''s “emissions footprint [47]”. In this context, R18
    noted: “if households became flexible users of energy that could increase the
    amount of intermittent renewable energy that could penetrate in the grid. By having
    homes that are using energy at the time when the grid needs it, would result in
    an environmental win, even if we weren''t using less energy”. R31 suggested that
    “individuals might feel that helping the environment is quite a big task, so if
    you can introduce smart home technologies which allow things like automation,
    it takes that difficult decision out of your hands and it actually knows when
    the grid is generating the greenest energy”. R29 highlighted the importance of
    these technologies in tackling climate change: “consumer engagement … is going
    to be absolutely essential to hit our 2050 goals and then the goals that will
    continue after … the trilemma cannot be achieved without these technologies and
    will be achieved with their use.” Hence promotional material such as Fig. 6, noting
    that adopting smart meters in the UK will save as much carbon dioxide as planning

    full-size image Fig. 6. Smart meter advertisement from Smart Energy GB, November
    2018. Source: Smart Energy GB Aesthetic benefits include liking how smart home
    technologies look, are designed, and add symbolic value to a house as an item
    of fashion or style. R4 stated that “People are positioned more in the emotional
    and aspirational side of the home, rather than the benefits. People want to have
    these technologies in their homes because it looks really cool and it''s something
    you can show off to people and it is like: hey, I''m futuristic.” R12 stated,
    “Smart home technologies are currently driven by status – not environmental motivations.
    It''s technophila, rather than technophobia, with people needing to possess and
    purchase the coolest gadget to have.” As R14 added “To some people, the benefits
    of adoption relate most to aesthetics, to people just being drawn to beautifully
    designed or new things, to show they are ahead of the curve.” Health benefits
    include the ability to alert relatives or health professionals to emergency events,
    aiding health diagnosis, and enabling aggregate level health analytics [48]. Such
    health benefits can be particularly acute for the elderly and aging, vulnerable
    people, or people with chronic medical conditions [19]. Confirming this benefit,
    a systematic review of smart homes and older adults with chronic illnesses did
    find that smart homes had a positive effect on physical functioning and depression
    [49]. As R14 stated, “assisted living is very interesting, enabling people to
    live at home longer or to live healthier lives. Charging an eclectic wheelchair,
    or figuring out treatment regimens for extreme medical conditions, or having NHS
    prescription medicines monitored, reordered and delivered automatically.” R11
    linked smart homes and mental health: “Some of the signs of people with dementia
    is that they forget to drink water and therefore they become dehydrated. So there
    are companies looking at putting controls in the house to measure how many times
    the kettle is boiled, how many times the toilet is flushed, so they can use this
    data to actually track if people are actually drinking water.” And finally, R23
    noticed the deployment of smart health technologies carried out by energy suppliers:
    “I know British Gas are increasingly looking at health stuff, like they can see
    if your grandma has put the kettle in the morning, so you are now able to monitor
    the vulnerable ones”. Social benefits related to inclusion—adopters feeling like
    they belonged to a community—or networking with others for professional or personal
    reasons. This relates to smart homes enabling people to better socialize and overcome
    feelings of depression or isolation. As R6 explained, “SHTs can become a way of
    being positively connected to others.” R14 surmised that “other benefits can be
    about connecting you to people who you love”. R23, mentioned that the main benefit
    of smart home technologies would be inclusion: “I think the main benefit is helping
    people navigate in an increasingly confusing world.” Educational benefits related
    to the enhanced learning opportunities smart home technologies can bring, whether
    accessing new forms of knowledge, undertaking digital training, or simply new
    ways of receiving information or developing new skills. During one of our site
    visits to the Apple Store, a salesperson remarked that “Some of the robots we
    have here are not only for children. Adults can use them too and learn how to
    code. In a way, I think all this new stuff is quite interactive and is pushing
    a new way of learning.” R28 perceives smart homes “as a platform of information
    in which you can coach and provide better services to the population”. R27 also
    mentioned that smart homes “could be a way to learn more about the performance
    of your home and then, optimize your own heating cycle based on what do you know.
    So either you can cede control or you can take it back.” Entertainment benefits
    centered on easier or better ways of listening to music, watching movies, or online
    streaming. R25 identified entertainment as a key benefit, since people demanded
    it this feature: “people want to watch Netflix, so you need an internet enabled
    TV, so no TV manufacturer is going to make one that it isn''t. That is where the
    smart technology is simply delivering something that consumers really want. And
    yes, it is a self-reinforcement circle in the sense that somebody didn''t know
    they wanted Netflix, but when they bought the TV, they had the possibility and
    explored it … there was a consumer desire for this service and the smartness just
    delivered that.” R28 identified entertainments as a hook to educate: “It is difficult
    to disentangle education and entertainment; you want to be educated and you want
    to be taught but it has to be entertaining otherwise you might not sign-up for
    those programs. I think the hook starts with entertainment and then you work from
    there”. Safety and security related to notifying the police of emergencies or
    preventing fires and severe accidents. As R6 explained, “Smart technology can
    prevent serious things happening, for example carbon monoxide detectors, smoke
    detectors, a way of turning off the heating if nobody is in the house. Detecting
    leaks, natural gas or water, serving a critical backup function.” Other enhanced
    experiences came second to last (e.g., new forms of shopping), with R15 explaining
    that “the hope is there will be additional apps built around smart home technologies
    that will create a smart ecosystem where new ways of shopping arise.” Whist R5
    linked enhanced experiences with comfort: “That is probably why Alexa is successful,
    it is very cheap and it does not do anything you were unable to do before. You
    could buy things on Amazon before by opening your laptop, now you just ask for
    it”. A final category of benefits was the likelihood of smart home technology
    providers giving away free or promotional items to “members” of their own communities,
    from R16''s “free coffee” to R30''s “a free iPhone upgrade every two years.” R18
    suggested: “Another approach could be giving appliances for free, but then taking
    a cut as a company. So if you have an appliance that you believe would save the
    household money or generate it; if you really believe it as a company, then you
    could operate a model where the risk is with the company rather than the household
    to create that return of investment”. R28 added: “I think most of these technologies
    are offering a payback period, so if you spend certain amount of money buying
    a device, after some time of using it, you will save enough to offset the cost.
    So if you are a company, you could offer these technologies for free”. Indeed,
    in London in 2019, the authors already saw repeated advertisements for smart data
    services where one could get back additional data or convert it into cash for
    fundraising for hobbies or the “church roof.” 6. Identifying potential barriers
    and risks to smart homes These benefits do not come without risks and barriers,
    however, and our material led to the identification of no less than 17 of these
    shown in Table 5. By risks, we meant potential downsides to adoption, and by barriers,
    we meant factors impeding adoption. Given risks and barriers relate to each other,
    and were often discussed together in the interviews, we have grouped them together
    for our analysis. These cut across the more standard dimensions discussed in the
    literature, such as Hargraves and Wilson''s classification of challenges across
    hardware and software, acceptability and usability, and domesticating technologies
    into lifestyles [34], or the Osservatori Digital Innovation del Politecnico di
    Milano, who suggests that the three main barriers to the smart home technology
    market are the installation of products, the integration of the offer with valuable
    services and the presence of established brands [50]. Table 5. Seventeen smart

    Source: Authors As perhaps expected by the literature, the top two barriers and
    risks related to concerns about consumer protection and data security, as well
    as technical reliability and smart home technologies working properly and not
    becoming quickly obsolete. In order to maximize their efficiency and performance,
    and also to move up to greater levels of smartness (See Fig. 4), smart homes need
    to collect a great deal of information about houses, affiliated technologies (such
    as appliances and even vehicles), user demographics and consumption patterns.
    However, this creates a severe risk that such data can be stolen, hacked, or misused.
    As R12 stated, “At the highest levels of smartness, homes are especially most
    vulnerable to hacking and security breaches. So it''s a paradox, the smarter your
    home is, the more vulnerable you become. Current security experts talk about how
    even a simple smart device like a toaster can be an entry for a hacker into the
    entire home. It creates a soft digital underbelly that thieves and hackers can
    exploit.” A related concern is whether the companies collecting this data, notably
    Google or Facebook, can be trusted. R27 suggested that the only real risk with
    the deployment of smart homes technologies is data: “Ultimately this is really
    about being able to identify you and your home and the status of your home at
    any given time. That is the real risk it starts to reveal very personal data.
    So companies out there, can you trust them with your data?” The other top barrier
    and risk related to technical reliability and obsolescence. The smarter homes
    become, the more complex and interconnected they are, but that could also create
    dependences that can erode reliability—for instance, many smart devices would
    simply not work in an electricity blackout, or may confuse a cat with a burglar.
    R2 noted part of this concern can be due to faulty installations and lack of familiarity
    with new devices. As they elaborated, “In our own trials of smart home technology,
    gas engineers and electricity engineers not familiar with the technology botched
    some installations or put things in backwards.” R6 added that “smart systems are
    layered and interdependent. A smart home is really using two sociotechnical systems,
    the electricity system layered on top of the IT system. One cannot work without
    the other, the lack of one can cause failure of both. We need to expect in smart
    systems that we will have problems from time to time, because they are clever,
    complex, and require expert knowledge, we need to keep our expectations realistic,
    and always have a plan B.” R12 noted that even when they are properly installed,
    there is “the risk of performance and systems crashing. We already expect smart
    phones or laptops to start to perform worse after a year or two, their screens
    freeze, they get viruses, they need to frequently restart. Imagine now that these
    problems afflict your home. Even if you only have to restart a whole home on an
    infrequent basis, it can still be a major hassle.” Other respondents discussed
    built in obsolescence and the speed of innovation within the sector. R6 stated
    that a major issue is “permanence, or rather impermanence. There will always be
    a subset of the population who buys the SHT bells and whistles stuff. They will
    use it for a bit, may use it if they are on their own, quite a lot, but over time
    they may get tired of it, and use it less, especially if it breaks, or needs upgraded.
    And upgrades can be related to hardware (becoming obsolete or out of date) but
    also software.” Usability and learning came up next, and include that many smart
    home devices may be perceived as not being easy or intuitive to use, not only
    by households but other elements of the smart ecosystem. They require uses to
    “adapt” or “domesticate” them into their lifestyles. R6 framed this challenge
    in terms of “Smart home technologies require user learning, but learning isn''t
    limited to users. System operators and business facilitators also have to learn,
    so do regulators, learning occurs across all of these [actors], and accountability
    becomes even more important in a smart system, precisely because it is so distributed.”
    Pilots of smart heating controls for example have found that previous familiarity
    with smart homes helped make adoption easier, same with previous experience using
    touch-screens [51]. Hargreaves and Wilson suggest that smart home technologies
    must also not overwhelm or overpower possible users with too many options or difficult
    to utilize controls [34]. R3 brought this point too: “Not everybody would like
    … too many choices of smart design.” R3 also distinguished between different types
    of learning necessary for adoption: practical learning (how to configure and use
    the technology), cognitive learning (understanding what they can do or be used
    for), and symbolic learning (incorporating devices into routines and practices),
    something that also arose in Ref. [34]. When any of these forms of learning break
    down, users can become frustrated—with some smart home users staying that “it
    wasn''t intuitive what parts of it you can do straight away” and “It''s too bloody
    complicated and there''s no point in it and it''s doing me no benefit, not worth
    it [43].” R22 illustrated usability with the following example: “I read the other
    day that someone bought a smart kettle and he spent 11 h trying to boil the water
    with the smart kettle, because there was so much setting up to do and connecting
    things. This technological wonderfulness needs to work well to make life easier.
    I mean, logging-in into your kettle is not probably as smart as switching on/off
    the kettle [yourself].” Perhaps surprisingly, issues centered on elitism, incumbency
    and market barriers, and the erosion of democracy came as the fourth most mentioned
    barrier. This relates to a perceived entrenching of market and political power
    among big smart home technology firms, who may use the data, revenues, or knowledge
    they collect to suit their own ends, rather than social goals of sustainability
    or poverty reduction [52]. R15 stated that “With all technologies, there is always
    a risk of them being easier to use and access by some and not others. We would
    be interested in whether smart thermostats are useable, especially by people less
    tech savvy. Or those who are physically disabled. This is why we did usability
    tests and smart heating controls. Smart meters have also been looked at for vulnerable
    groups, and how to ensure that they benefit. The last thing we want is a smart
    system to only benefit some in society. We must always hedge against this distribution
    risk.” R12 added that “there is a risk in terms of companies and incumbency. Smart
    home systems are becoming the domain of big established companies, some of the
    biggest in the world, including Apple and Amazon but also Panasonic, Samsung,
    and Philips. This means the smart home agenda is controlled and dominated by a
    small number of voices with very big interests.” This consolidation of market
    power and data could, in the extreme, undermine democracy, entrench new forms
    of power, and threaten recent gains in equality. Given smart technology firms
    often operate in a regulatory environment that is opaque, loosely regulated when
    it comes to taxes, and prone to immense lobbying, a smart home society would create
    a “toxic cocktail for democracy [53]” or a new era of “surveillance capitalism
    [54].” Uncertainty over the future as well as whether smart home benefits will
    be shared or monetized was mentioned as another frequent challenge. R22 illustrated
    monetization as a barrier in the following way: “Another barrier, of course, from
    the commercial point is the monetization. So yes, you can provide smart fridge
    services but how do you actually get the money saved from the energy system …
    how do you prove that somebody avoided peak demand? Or how much energy they reduced
    compared to the counterfactuals of what the demand would have been? How do you
    get rewarded for grid services that at the moment are not reflected in household
    tariffs or contracts?” R24 mentioned that “There is a lot of niche stuff, smart
    light bulbs [for example] where you can change the color over again but you might
    get bored of it and never do it again. At the moment, the business case for smart
    homes is unclear, it seems more about novelty than anything else.” Interoperability
    and resilience captured the risk that not all equipment, devices, appliances,
    or systems will operate together, especially when they may be from different retail
    suppliers or use different networks and protocols. R6 cautioned that “Interoperability
    issues and incumbency can get in the way of smart tech take-up. It may also mean
    people get left with stranded assets, some specialized piece of tech that no longer
    works, and the company making it has gone out of business.” Hargreaves and Wilson
    framed the interoperability challenge in three dimensions: needing smart home
    technologies that are compatible with non-smart homes and appliances, with busy
    lives and routines, and with existing support systems [34]. Interoperability is
    especially challenging given that it requires not only technologies to work together,
    but different smart home firms and operators to establish better cooperative relationships
    with providers, and that items can be replaced without disrupting the operational
    performance of a smart home [11]. Energy rebounds and wasteful consumption referred
    to the fact that many smart home technologies are not about saving energy or becoming
    more sustainable, but prioritizing other issues such as comfort, luxury, or convenience.
    R2 aptly noted that “some emerging evidence, and intuition, says that smart tech
    can result in waste, hence the proliferation of robot lawn mowers or vacuum cleaners
    that are always on. Smart home technologies can embed more energy-intensive routines
    and practices, and do so more deeply and invisibly into our lives … Humans are
    remarkably creative at coming up with new ways to use energy … The human capacity
    to invent new ways to waste energy is profound.” R12 agreed and noted that “there
    is little evidence smart technologies have a positive effect on sustainability.
    They are driven by other, non-environmental desires that often lead to increases
    in energy demand … People who adopt smart tech feel good, embodied in the sensory
    feedback of the devices, and other people say they look good with their smart
    tech, so the whole thing works against a culture of energy demand reduction. The
    culture of the home focuses on high tech, but not thoughtful consumption, not
    on efficiency, or simplicity. It is not a culture that privileges energy demand
    reduction as key form of social feedback.” There is thus a fear that increasing
    data and the "Internet of Things" could require a “tsunami of data” and greatly
    increase global electricity usage [55]. Strengers and Nicholls show how the convenience
    narrative full of smart devices could transform everyday practices in ways that
    increase not only energy consumption, but household labor [1], or lead to greater
    energy intensive loads for things like air conditioning or electricity [56]. Tirado
    Herrero et al. also find that smart home technologies can reinforce unsustainable
    energy consumption [57]. R30 commented on this aspect too: “Overall I like the
    idea of smart homes, but like with every technological development there is this
    risk of rebound effects were you end up using more.” For reasons such as these,
    Makhadmeh et al. caution that optimizing power demand for smart home appliances
    represents a significant challenge that future power suppliers will have to address
    [58]. Smart home technologies could lead to loss of personal control and autonomy,
    with households becoming more dependent on smart technology. This could create
    conditions where people serve the system, rather than having the system serve
    them. R2 called this the “paradox” of smart homes, that homes “get [enhanced]
    control only by linking homes and heating to broader systems of provision, particularly
    the internet and digital technologies, connecting them into a broader network.
    Smart technologies with cloud based data, storage and processing provide more
    control and functionality, but also embed those individuals in a larger whole,
    a larger system. This makes it a relational dimension with mutual dependences.”
    R6 framed this in terms of “an exchange of roles,” with the traditional model
    being about energy services for a household, but a new model can be “the home
    is there only to provide services to the network … Smart is sold as being liberating,
    but that liberation comes with hidden dependencies. Smart stuff is so clever that
    only experts fully understand it, especially particular components such as the
    algorithms, which only the backroom boys know. We invest an extraordinary amount
    of trust and power in those who write the algorithms and who design the smart
    system. If something is going wrong with smart tech, chances are you won''t be
    able to fix it yourself.” R12 lastly noted that in their perspective, “the key
    risk is ceding autonomy and independence in the home. While smart systems are
    supposed to provide more control, because we don''t fully understand how they
    work, we quickly end up out of control when things go wrong. When a smart tech
    fails, we need to ring somebody up to help fix it, these technologies are impossible
    to fix yourself.” Indeed, a representative national survey of UK homeowners (n
    = 1025) found that ceding autonomy and independence in the home for increased
    technological control were the main perceived risks [8]. Although framed as efficient,
    many smart home technologies are resource or material intensive as well. Walzberg
    et al. note explicitly that more refined life cycle analyses are needed to compute
    the environmental impacts of smart homes across multiple indicators and stages
    of their product lifetimes [59]. R6 captured this nicely, when they noted that
    “There is a risk of using smartness in an over-abstract way, something ‘whizzy
    and weightless’. We used to have an IT support person who always said to us sternly,
    you think of the cloud as some abstract immaterial entity, but I think of someone
    else''s physical computer or server. A cloud is lumps of metal somewhere, lots
    of processors, materials, and energy usage. In the same way, smart technology
    requires extraction and processing of an abundance of materials. It has meaningful
    and measurable social and ecological impacts, given that many of those materials
    come from troubled parts of the world.” R20 stated that “the E-waste risk is obviously
    bad, it is quite a hidden thing, and not many people have looked into the environmental
    footprint of the manufacturing of these devices. At the moment, I think just smart
    phones'' annual production has the same carbon footprint as the whole of the UK
    transport sector and it is growing. That is just carbon in production, it has
    nothing to do with the end-of-life situation.” R12 added that a smart home revolution
    could even change our culture in ways that embed material consumption and notions
    of abundance: “Smart homes become a way of showing off to friends but also demonstrating
    competency. So people who work at home—cooks, musicians, childminders—may start
    to indoctrinate the idea that to do these things well you need smart home systems.
    This can spread and change the dynamic and trajectory of energy practices in a
    more energy intensive direction across multiple households, adding to the treadmill
    of consumption, not slowing it down. It is social feedback the wrong way … Its
    sole purpose is to keep going further and faster along current trajectories, not
    about transforming the system or questioning its underlying assumptions.” Lack
    of home ownership was another identified barrier, given that many times people
    need to own their own property, rather than rent or lease. Then, they often need
    to own an entire house, not just a room or a flat. R17 pointed out to this barrier
    in terms of incentives: “Only around 20 to 30 percent of people actually own their
    apartments, the rest … rent.” In a similar vein, R31 mentioned home-ownership
    as a key deterrent: “There is a lot of people who aren''t going to be incentivized
    to buy [smart tech]. Property ownership has been a huge barrier for smart meters.”
    Cultural differences could exist as another barrier, especially concerning global
    diffusion. R22 framed it as: “It is quite interesting [to see] the cultural differences
    between Germany and the UK. Here [in the UK] we are quite casual with the personal
    data … in Germany, you have the living memory of the Stasi.” R5 elaborated on
    global aspects of culture connected to political structures and deployment patterns:
    “Europe is well ahead in this area because it seems to be a very pro-consumer
    approach. There are political structures that allow consumers'' organizations
    to defend consumers. Whilst in the US, it is more driven by the manufacturers
    instead of government. That is how the system works, it is more like companies
    realizing what the downsides are. In parts of Asia it is more like Europe, other
    parts of Asia are more like the US. And there is China, where my favorite quote
    I heard from one of our potential customers was: ''I''m Chinese why do I worry
    about security? My government does that for me''”. Other respondents discussed
    how lack of connectivity to the internet, such as in rural areas or the developing
    world, could greatly impede adoption. Also included in this category were barriers
    related to lack of proper standards and certification across smart home technologies
    and only nascently developed supply chains. R16 mentioned: “in less developed
    countries, we''re still talking very much about plain vanilla technology, both
    in terms of buildings construction, as well as the type of devices that they are
    putting in the market”. R7 added: “Connectivity is a huge barrier, so even if
    Wi-Fi penetration is quite high, it is often incomplete in social housing. Also,
    if we look at Low Power Wide Area Network Systems or any other IoT there is a
    big question of infrastructure … one of the biggest challenges for the hardware
    providers is that nobody really knows who is going to win this IoT battle.” Corporate
    accountability, while similar to the erosion of democracy, was mentioned as a
    barrier more about companies honoring smart home commitments and being open and
    honest about problems and transparent about their marketing and promotional material.
    R27 illustrated this point by stating: “If something goes wrong, can you get great
    customer service to get it fixed very quickly and could you seek redress for harm
    or any detriment caused? In an ideal world, it should not matter who you go to,
    with the very bundled smart home you should be able to go to any of the of the
    components suppliers to fix it, but I am not sure that will happen.” R13 addressed
    this issue by cautioned about: “it is questionable whether consumers could navigate
    redress processes or even know who to contact when something goes wrong, especially
    dealing with multiple products which interact and are provided by multiple companies.”
    Whilst R23 linked corporate accountability with the use of AI: “The other issue
    is when you get into AI and machine learning. Where you get these huge datasets
    and rather than anyone looking at it and analyzing it, it is through into a machine.
    That could be very risky because accountability goes away and the system becomes
    harder for consumers to challenge it. Because we will reach a point where people
    cannot even explain the formula.” One study in Italy, for example, noted that
    more than half of the smart home products on sale are offered by start-ups with
    little strength and brand recognition, often not perceived as sufficiently mature
    and reliable by consumers [50]. A related concern here was lock in to a particular
    company''s products, with multiple respondents mentioning how some smart home
    technology could be proprietary, meaning only certain applications would work
    only with certain brands, trapping people into having less choice. This becomes
    especially acute when one “inherits” a bundle of smart home technologies when
    moving into, or purchasing, a new house. R23 warned about these risks: “Another
    big barrier is being locked-in, particularly in rental properties. If you move
    into a house and it has an Apple smart kit and you are bringing with you a Google
    smart kit and they can''t talk to each other, you are in a position where the
    consumer now has to buy all the Apple stuff.” The actual cost of smart home technology,
    surprisingly, was not more frequently mentioned, even though all smart appliances,
    devices, sensors, and systems cost much, much more than their conventional counterparts.
    As R12 indicated, “The most obvious barrier to me is cost. As these are high end
    products, cost is the single biggest barrier. Many times smart home devices are
    the most expensive options, therefore people simply do not buy them.” This theme
    was also picked up during our retail visits, with one Home Base salesperson commenting
    that in their opinion, “Smart home technologies are not much requested nor bought.
    They are still too expensive for the regular customer.” This statement becomes
    all the more apparent when one realizes a smart coffee machine we viewed during
    one of our site visits at John Lewis currently cost £1299.99. Fear of new technology
    was mentioned as an additional barrier. R1 noted that even more than privacy,
    “fear of the unknown” is a significant obstacle, given “the perception users have
    on smart meters played out in terms of how the press created some fear around
    smart technologies.” As one salesperson confided during a visit to Peter Jones,
    “Only one person has actually been interested in buying a connected washing machine
    and oven. In general, at least for these appliances, people still prefer the traditional
    versions.” Two respondents mentioned social isolation and loneliness as risks,
    a counterpoint to the social inclusion benefits above. Technology comes to replace
    actual interaction with humans, and can lead to distress and depression. R6 questioned
    “in a society where loneliness is a major case of distress, smart home technology
    is a cold substitute for actual warm people. Is that ultimately a good thing?”
    Smart home technologies could exclude people in two ways: by replacing human communication
    with virtual communication, and by excluding non-users from new online communities
    [19]. One person mentioned the potential health concerns. R30 mentioned: “I think
    of all these wireless connections we still do not know the long-term health implications.
    I think it connects to the smart homes because we are probably adding more signals,
    with unknown health effects.” 7. Calibrating more sustainable smart home policies
    Our respondents did not discuss only benefits and barriers and risks, but also
    11 policy changes that need implemented to make smart homes more sustainable.
    Table 6 offers a summary of these suggested policies. Taken together, these polices
    would promote more sustainable smart home development and deployment across social,
    environmental, political, and technical dimensions. Table 6. Eleven smart home
    technology policy recommendations discussed by expert interview respondents (n
    = 31). Rank Frequency by interview Topic Dimension of sustainability 1 18 58.06%

    Authors By far the most strongly suggested policy recommendation was the need
    for better consumer protection, privacy, and data security. This covered many
    aspects of smart home technologies, from data control and restrictions, to encryption,
    to clear guidelines for ownership of data, as well as safeguards against hacking
    and piracy. As R2 noted, “better data and privacy and consumer confidence … are
    needed to ensure service providers behave in a way that does not undermine confidence
    and trust.” And as R15 concurred, “stronger consumer protection and regulation
    is a must, regulation to protect consumers is essential.” A second recommendation,
    given the potential for energy rebounds and waste, relates to ensuring that smart
    home technologies deliver on improvements in efficiency, emissions reduction,
    energy consumption, and sustainability. R2 elaborated that “I am most interested
    in scripting, how to design hardware, control systems, algorithms, and other factors
    that push energy downwards. This means smart home technologies are not neutral,
    cannot be controlled any way they like. We need to make smart tech directional,
    to design it to explicitly reduce energy. There are a multitude of ways to do
    that, from building it into the kit, or making it the default, a ''harder'' path,
    to merely allowing people to set controls a certain way, a ''softer'' path. The
    result would be setting constraints on people, smart home technologies allow people
    to do some things, but it also doesn''t allow them to do others.” R12 added that
    without scripting, “until reductions in energy demand or carbon are guaranteed,
    there is no case for smart energy homes.” Such scripting would perhaps automatically
    cutoff smart home devices if they exceed a certain threshold in terms of emissions
    or energy consumption. Participants suggested the need for stronger regulations
    for energy services or Internet of Things. To this, R27 mentioned: “peer-to-peer
    and service base models need to move away from prescription towards more ethical
    based regulation, so that you are not dictating the business model, but adhering
    to principles to treat consumers fairly”. For this to happen, R21 added that companies
    may need to collaborate with each other as well as consumers: “I know Wi-Fi and
    Bluetooth are competing with each other. That is also with LPWAN and LoRa. They
    are all trying to have their own security standards. So now, we should find a
    space to standardize coding across the whole spectrum. And you have to consider
    two sides, developer and consumer, to make the consumer happy with a certain interface
    where they do not need to buy different products, for different things”. With
    this in mind, R1 noted: “Essentially we need policies around improving communication
    protocols between devices such as easy to use and set ups.” Other than these top
    three policy recommendations, another suggestion was for government to continue
    to provide research as a platform for innovation and learning. This includes more
    investment in independent science as well as the sponsoring of pilot studies and
    trials. As R14 noted, “creating spaces for different institutions to learn together
    is important … A Living Lab environment where people can experience changes and
    companies and research institutions can work with them to figure out how to improve
    the experience and also fix things that go wrong, seeing which work best, and
    also maintaining consumer protection, would be ideal … Governments need to create
    this environment where the sector can learn how to deliver the outcomes society
    wants, and government can make sure they protect consumers and meet the target.”
    R15 added that “Government plays a critical role in innovation, BEIS in particular
    has a £500 million innovation program for energy … This innovation money is intended
    to support businesses through the valley of death. Innovation funding and R&D
    is really important.” Other participants discussed the need for policy that removes
    barriers and encourages more open market competition. In their systematic review
    of the smart homes literature, Marikyan et al. warned that regulation and legal
    stipulations have fallen behind of innovation, with many gaps in national policy
    and legislation [19]. To this, R26 linked smart meter with competition: “If we
    are thinking about the energy smartness, policies that would allow competitiveness
    and reduce prescriptiveness are needed. So for example: forcing the rollout of
    smart meters with in-home displays is wasteful as it introduces a technology,
    the display, which will most likely be redundant in a few years”. The provision
    of reliable information and knowledge was articulated as another recommendation,
    including material printed or online. As R15 explained, “Sharing knowledge and
    evidence is key. Industry has knowledge but it''s always hard to get out. Government
    is needed to make strong data and evidence publicly available to all.” This suggestion
    was followed by setting standards—across a variety of domains, including technology
    as well as advertising and marketing. This, too, covered many aspects of smart
    home technologies, from better standards for installers and technology providers,
    to guidelines for consumers, to advertising efforts and better labeling. In terms
    of advertising, R12 suggested that “energy efficiency labels should be made and
    applied to all smart home devices, like the rating scheme we have for lighting
    or boilers, to ensure the environmental benefits are clear." R15 mentioned that
    “Standards can allow smart controls to be a requirement.” Hargreaves and Wilson
    suggest creating national systems of independent certification schemes for smart
    home technology assessors, installers, and finance providers [34]. Furthermore,
    protections need in place to avoid a “digital divide” and ensure that smart home
    technologies do not aggravate poverty and vulnerability. R12 emphasized that “we
    must make sure that vulnerable groups are not excluded from any smart home revolution
    so that no one is left behind. We can tailor literacy, training, and learning,
    so that those unfamiliar and excluded can come to feel confident and comfortable,
    or also enhance the welfare of those who cannot afford smart home systems.” R14
    agreed and stated that “smart home technologies will not meet social objectives
    like tackling fuel poverty or decarbonizing without government intervention and
    strong policy.” Hargreaves and Wilson already warn that lower income households,
    the elderly, or those in rural areas with poor internet access are later adopters
    of smart home technologies [34]. Grants, subsidies, and free technical advice
    could be targeted at these groups, as well as efforts to improve high-speed internet
    access. The promotion of required interoperability and upgrades is yet another
    vital area for government. Hargreaves and Wilson note that clear national policy
    guidelines can ensure hardware and software is compatible not only within the
    home, but also with communications portals as well as energy suppliers or system
    operators, especially during periods of peak usage [34]. Both R8 and R23 commented
    on tackling interoperability to benefit consumers and avoid been locked-in. Respectively,
    they noted: “Interoperability needs to be addressed. Smart ecosystems have to
    play well with each other … so users are not trapped in a particular system”.
    R27 echoed this concern: “We need central policies on business converging on standards
    for interoperability to avoid misspending capital … I think these technologies
    should be interoperable by default.” Redirecting efforts to other policy areas
    underscores that we should not place all of our bets on smart technology. Or,
    in other words, that we also continue to invest in other measures, such as energy
    efficiency, passive design of infrastructure, or fuel poverty, in tandem with
    smart investments. As R6 explained, “I am not sure I actually want policies to
    accelerate smart homes until we tackle other problems. Here in the UK, we have
    a real, enormous and serious problem of homelessness, all the hidden homeless
    alongside those on the streets. Among the homes we have, 8 million could do with
    getting loft insulation for the first time or topped up to a decent level. We
    have an enormous amount of work to make homes more livable, getting energy demand
    down from those, and eradicating fuel poverty. If you really want to improve lives,
    lessen the environmental impact of our energy system, and create jobs, you don''t
    want to focus on smart, you want to focus on ordinary energy efficiency upgrades,
    such as retrofits and refurbishments. We have so much policy attention on smart
    home technologies, but so few on creating decent social housing for the chronically
    poor.” R9 estimated that “turning the temperature down 1 degrees saves £75 a year,
    you don''t need smart tech to do that!” As Fig. 7 suggests, more annual savings
    for households can occur in the UK from investments in efficient boilers, insulation,
    and windows than smart controls or behavioral change from smart meters. Download

    Monetary savings from different home energy efficiency options in the United Kingdom,

    and ensuring consumer benefits came next as a policy suggestion. As R25 noted:
    “policies are not designed with ‘me’ in mind, they are designed with the system
    in mind. So principle number one needs to be to think about what it looks like
    from the consumers'' perspective, would it persuade consumers to do what we want
    them to do? Too much data flows from the consumer but very few rewards flow to
    consumers. Policy must correct that.” 8. An agenda for future smart homes research
    Notwithstanding the findings from our study concerning benefits, barriers and
    risks, and policies, we also believe it points towards three areas of future research.
    8.1. The demographics and practices of early adopters The first, and perhaps most
    obvious, is that we need more research of actual smart home users and adopters,
    those with direct experience of the technologies, rather than work on the more
    common general public opinions and perceptions. Studies of some early adopters
    suggest that they share complex characteristics not representative of the national
    population. In the United Kingdom, for instance, trials of smart heating controls
    suggest that the youngest age of users (18–35 years old) were most satisfied and
    able to perform the most tasks; those 55 years old and above were significantly
    less satisfied, as were those with a physical disability [51]. In Israel, smart
    home technology was similarly more favored by the young, with smaller families
    or households, who did not consider themselves religious [2]. In Australia, participants
    in a smart homes trial tended to be 25 years or older as well as high income earners
    [60]. Interestingly, according to Jensen et al. [60] such smart home users could
    be described according to three archetypes or personas. The helper sought to keep
    devices on all the time to assist with tasks and thus led at times to increased
    energy or lighting demands. The optimizer focused attention on smaller actions
    (e.g. turning lights off) and sought the energy efficiency benefits of devices.
    The hedonist was more playful and utilized smart home devices to create aesthetically
    pleasing and fun living spaces. Several recent papers have called for developing
    a better picture of who smart homes users are, and a better understanding of how
    smart home technologies are used in practice, looking at the relationships between
    smart technology and its users, and consideration of the purpose of smart homes
    [20,21,43,61]. This connects in part to the issue of energy rebounds and waste.
    Horner et al. [62] suggest that while the technical potential of net energy savings
    from ICT is “likely positive”, the magnitude and even sign of real savings is
    unclear and difficult to assess, depending on user interaction and broader societal
    impacts. They suggest that empirical studies are needed to gather more data on
    how ICT systems are actually deployed and used in practice, in order to better
    identify the parameters driving energy use in ICT-heavy systems. This knowledge
    would help avoid a situation where smart home technologies are developed and sold
    based on poor or misleading information [43]. Both R16 and R22 cautioned on this
    issue, respectively they noted: “You can have a huge rebound effect. When you
    look at the number of connected devices and we''re now into millions in the market,
    every single one of those consume a little bit of power all the time when they
    are connected. When you add it up, you get millions of devices that are all consuming
    electricity just to be connected” and “smart homes could be a double edged sword,
    there is no clear evidence if this is going to reduce demand”. Moreover, incomplete
    information has been highlighted in criticism that the smart home industry and
    its vision creators are overwhelmingly male [1], and that the “smart technology
    agenda” focuses on a “masculine ideal consumer,” suggesting more consideration
    of the gendered roles in everyday life is necessary for a successful transition
    to a future of smart homes [20]. Furthermore, articles about smart homes are often
    authored by people associated with the industry, who are advocating smart technologies,
    even representing industry visions of how everyday practices “should” change [1].
    8.2. The duality of control Much of the smart home technology narrative circulates
    around the notion of “control,” as Fig. 8 illustrates, but we suggest this notion
    needs further unpacked and contextualized. R22 remarked that “smart homes open
    a very interesting debate about control and to use a popular political phrase
    of recent times, all these technologies are being sold on the grounds of taking
    back control. But, if we look carefully, a lot of control might be taken away
    from people.” Download : Download high-res image (646KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 8. A Curry''s PC World advertisement for smart homes centering on “control,”
    London, November 2018. Source: Authors For instance, there seems to be a duality
    of meaning about smart control that actually conflicts with itself. The first
    notion of control involves informing and empowering consumers to make better “energy
    choices,” and enabling smart technologies to act with minimum consumer participation
    [57], epitomized by efforts from the Low Carbon Innovation Coordination Group
    [63] or the European Union Smart Grids Task Force [64]. The second suggests that
    smart technologies would work better by “circumventing” users to optimize energy
    use. Chen et al. [65] epitomize this view by framing smart home systems as an
    intelligent “butler” acting both to reduce energy use and peak load, but also
    predicting user demands and managing smart appliances as “servants.” This dichotomous
    representation of control however can be criticized, as the first presents an
    informed consumer as an unrealistic automaton [66], while trials suggest users
    limit themselves to the more basic functions of SHTs [43]. The second implies
    an indifferent consumer, leaving no room for an engaged citizen; this approach
    could miss opportunities for domestic energy savings through demand side management
    [66]. A more fruitful conceptualization of control comes from Hargreaves and Wilson,
    who suggest in Table 7 that it can include objects, loci, and distinct implications
    for sustainability, as well as different types of control: technological (which
    they call “artifactual”), perceptual, and relational [34]. Technological control
    refers to the actual, physical ability to use or program technologies, but perceptual
    control relates to more diffuse and difficult attempts to control consumption
    patterns or even emotions, and relational control expands this over an entire
    lifestyle or household identity. The implication is that we need further research
    on how various types of control can clash and create a paradox where some increases
    in control, say technological, can erode and diminish feelings of perceptual or
    relational control, overwhelming adopters. Table 7. Objects, loci, and implications
    of “control” for smart home technologies. Empty Cell Technological Perceptual
    Relational Object of control Technologies, devices Perceptions, feelings Everyday
    lives, activities, relationships Locus of control Smart technologies Users Relationships
    between people and activities Core assumptions More control over more devices
    is better People want to feel in control People desire control over their domestic
    lives Implications for sustainability Smart homes should lead to energy demand
    reduction through rational management Smart homes may lead to demand reduction
    if users feel ‘"in control," but may also have little or negative impact if users
    feel out of control Smart homes may lead to demand reduction, but may also generate
    more energy-intensive lives Source: Modified from Ref. [34]. 8.3. Beyond smart
    homes to socio-technical systems, practices, and justice A final theme we suggest
    exploring is to decenter the home in the analysis of smart home technologies,
    and to expand it to look at (a) the socio-technical system of smart at other scales
    including cities, states, and even regions; (b) practices; and (c) equity, inclusion,
    and justice. R12 made this point about a systems focus explicitly, suggesting
    that: “There is an important agenda to expand smart home research beyond feedback,
    from beyond a device like a smart meter, to the whole home, then to smart grids
    and smart cities and a smart planet. The notion of smart operates across a variety
    of scales.” Expanding the unit of analysis from homes to systems would remind
    us that smart home technologies also involve global organizations, institutional
    rule systems and structures, and cultural values. This demands a shift in focus
    from individual technologies to the broader scope of “systems of systems [67].”
    R25 added: “We need to get away from the obsession we have in policy terms of
    supporting a technology … we need to think about the home as part of the system.”
    An array of specific socio-technical approaches could be well suited to expand
    the conceptual repertoire of theoretical frameworks used to understand smart homes.
    As Table 8 indicates, the Multi-Level Perspective (MLP) analyzes socio-technical
    transitions by emphasizing regimes, dominant routines, and alternative spaces
    or niches. Actor Network Theory (ANT) invokes concepts such as “network assemblages”
    and “sociotechnical imbroglios” to focus on agency or politics, especially at
    the micro level. The Social Construction of Technology (SCOT) emphasizes closure,
    frames, and the meaning groups of stakeholders give to technology. Technological
    Innovation Systems (TIS) do assess complexity and variation in large systems,
    but prioritize the functional aspects of innovation. Large Technical Systems approaches
    underscore the role of system builders as well as how path dependence becomes
    embedded. Table 8. Five socio-technical conceptual approaches relevant for smart

    modified from Ref. [68]. Novel approaches to smart homes do not necessarily need
    limited to socio-technical systems. Social Practice Theory – also called by some
    “theories of practice” – seeks to reveal the beliefs, values, lifestyles and tastes
    that express personal choice behind behavior [69]. At its heart sits the notion
    of a “practice,” a type of behavior that is routinized much as is a habit, but
    that also links together bodily activity, mental activity, and things and their
    uses [70]. Social practice theorists [[71], [72], [73]] have tended to argue that
    a practice approach emphasizes four things, which can certainly be applied to
    smart home technologies. Materials or materiality encompasses the technologies,
    tangible physical entities and other things that make up material objects of a
    smart home. Competencies would reflect the skills, habits, knowledge, tacit knowledge
    and technique needed to utilize smart home technologies or services. Meanings
    would capture the ideas, symbolism, aspirations, and other cognitive dimensions
    attributed to or associated with smart homes. Connections would describe how certain
    practices for smart homes emerge, persist, shift, or disappear over time. Indeed,
    multiple respondents discussed how smart homes could lead to an extension or transformation
    of practices. R21 mentioned the possibility that “smart technologies can automatically
    recognize behaviors and changes in the environment based on the use of preferences
    and perform on predefined routes to act,” whereas R28 commented that smart homes
    could be instrumental in aiding an “understanding of user routines” as well as
    “pro-environmental behaviors.” The strength to this approach is that it would
    also, similar to socio-technical transitions theory, de-centre the smart home
    in analysis and better describe how processes of change are integrated with social
    processes and very often mundane everyday shared conventions of living, doing
    and working [70]. Finally, justice or equity centered frameworks would ask analysts
    to regard smart home technology and systems as more than simply hardware, as beyond
    a black box, and instead in moral or judgmental terms. In other words, these approaches
    would reframe or re-politicize what smart home technologies are [70]. Smart home
    technologies can be seen through this lens as possible mechanisms of resource
    extraction that transfer wealth from developing countries to developed ones, or
    systems of segregation that separate negative harms from the positive attributes
    across different classes of consumers. As R13 warned, smart homes could give rise
    to serious “distributional impacts … if people are unable to access these technologies
    … these people might be excluded from these technologies and we need to bring
    them along to this journey or at least offer them some protection”. A similar
    point was brought by R31, who stated: “The energy market is about to become a
    lot more complicated and that is something were the analogue energy market absolutely
    failed at doing, which was protecting the most vulnerable people and that is something
    that the smart energy market obviously must do.” Thus, smart home technologies
    can potentially concentrate political power, facilitate inequality or vulnerability,
    or validate unfair or elitist patterns of smart home diffusion, which make them
    well suited to examine from an explicit equity and justice lens. 9. Conclusion
    In sum, for consumers at least here in Europe and the UK, the smart home revolution
    is upon us. We documented a sobering 267 smart home technology options available
    to consumers today, provided by 113 different companies and available from a multitude
    of direct suppliers, home improvement stores, general department stores, and electronics
    and appliance retail shops. This array of options ranges from devices that can
    merely create isolated or bundled smart services, at lower levels of the smart
    spectrum, all the way towards more automated, intuitive, and sentiment options
    such as artificial intelligence, robots, and drones. Whether users will adopt
    and embrace this motley collection of devices, however, is uncertain, all the
    more so since adoption is a complex process that cuts across many of the dimensions
    we examined in this study. For instance, the evidence we collected across our
    expert interviews, site visits, and academic literature suggests that, among other
    things: • Concerns about privacy, security, and hacking must be addressed; • Smart
    home technology must operate reliability and intuitively, with strong warranties
    and built in longevity; • Users will not just magically absorb new technologies
    into their homes and lifestyles, instead learning and acceptance need to occur;
    • Efforts must be made to ensure markets for the technology remain open and transparent,
    and threats to democracy and surveillance capitalism identified and managed; •
    Interoperability needs assured across multiple levels, including between non-smart
    and smart devices, smart devices and each other, and smart devices and different
    systems across various suppliers and layered infrastructures (such as electricity,
    heat, internet, and so on); • Energy rebounds and wasteful consumption must be
    reduced, perhaps through better standards, information to users, or even built
    in “scripts” that shut off devices that lead to excessive consumption or carbon
    emissions; • Similarly, material inputs and the backside of the digital economy
    need managed sustainably, especially flows of electronic waste and the energy
    needed for data centers and ICT; • Interventions need targeted to ensure a digital
    divide does not worsen and that poor, vulnerable, or otherwise excluded groups
    can benefit fully from emerging smart home options. This laundry list of suggestions
    mirrors those made in some of the literature. Balta-Ozkan et al. suggest that
    user acceptance of smart home technologies must meet five different dimensions
    (which intersect with some of our other identified barriers): fitting with lifestyles,
    being easy to use and administer, being interoperable with existing homes, being
    perceived as reliable, and being perceived as safe [74]. Wilson and Hargreaves
    also argue that “smartness” must be promoted but only in ways congruent to perceptions
    of the home, and the values and identities of its occupants [20]. One implication
    is that given widespread diffusion of smart home technologies rests on such a
    complex confluence of factors, it may continue to occur in isolated bits of technology
    rather than across multiple bundled systems. Another implication is that not all
    smart home devices meet sustainability goals, and that for the technology to have
    transformative impacts on reducing energy demand—or, even just incremental reductions
    in demand—the sector needs strongly guided by government and policy. Such policies
    at the moment appear to occur in a fragmented manner across different silos such
    as smart meters, smart grids, or the Internet of Things. Instead, our evidence
    strongly suggests we need an integrated set of smart homes policies that not only
    protect consumers but also set restrictions to ensure such devices meet other
    climate and energy goals (such as fuel poverty or efficiency), sponsor innovation
    and trials for learning, and set technical and marketing standards. Even then,
    future research ought to focus more on the experiences of actual adopters, expand
    notions of control, and begin to focus on smart systems of systems, or bundles
    of practices, rather than just individual discrete homes. Perhaps then, with a
    more thoughtful and coordinated mix of policies in place, and research attuned
    to more nuanced, independent, and dispassionate dimensions of smart home technologies,
    their adoption will begin to fulfill some of the objectives their advocates continually
    promise. Declaration of competing interest None of the authors have any formal
    conflicts of interest to declare. Acknowledgements The authors gratefully acknowledge

    Definitions of smart home technologies by expert respondents (n = 31) # Definition
    R1 There is a range of different smart devices, but the distinguishing factors
    that make them smart are system functionality and how their systems communicate
    and operate. R2 SHTs are a diverse constellation of technologies which provide
    households with greater controllability over a variety of domestic systems, processes
    and services. This can range from heating and lighting to electricity use and
    appliances, to security, safety, and so forth. R3 Smart home technologies are
    intelligent operating systems which allow users to operate different parts of
    the house, the environment and ambient. With the goal of easing the life of users.
    R4 Smart home technologies are eclectic products that are installed at homes through
    internet or external networks connected. They are everyday objects enabled by
    smart services that should do more than they could do before. R5 Smart home technologies
    are devices that are able to make decisions; thus the smartness. These devices
    should be able to make those decisions based on users'' behaviors, commands and
    preferences. R6 I see two categories of smart home technologies. The first, is
    the smart home with an emphasis on what happens in the home; there are sensors
    around the place and could be remotely controlled. The key elements in this category
    are “switching and sensing,” with what used to be the province of human beings
    in the home getting delegated to the technology. The second category, is how smart
    technology changes the boundaries of the home by bringing the Information Technology
    (IT) into the electricity system. Here, the key word is “Connectivity” and should
    provide users with the possibility of changing local network operation as the
    result of what happens in the home R7 Smart home technology is any device that
    helps the user to do certain tasks more efficiently; whether these tasks are related
    to security, improving the energy efficiency of the house or by adjusting to users''
    daily routines. So basically, anything that is useful for the user and connected
    from (IoT). R8 Smart homes are an extension of an everyday technology. There is
    an implication that it is digital. If a smart home is digital, then it has the
    ability to learn and adapt to people and extend the capabilities of people. R9
    Smart home technologies are internet connected technologies which can monitor
    or control aspects of the home. R10 Smart home technologies are devices within
    the home that possess network connectivity. Hence, are able to cooperate through
    computation to enable things to happen with all the other connected devices in
    the home. R11 Smart home technologies are everyday objects and devices that connect
    to the internet and to each other; not computers, smartphones, or tablets. Smart
    devices often connect to apps on mobile devices, allowing users to control them
    remotely. R12 Smart homes should use information and communication technologies
    to enhance domestic life. In this sense, a truly smart home is the one which uses
    ICT through the use of interactive settings and feedback on the domestic environment.
    R13 Smart home technologies are internet enabled devices that respond to signals.
    These could range from price signals to DNR signals. R14 Smart can refer to how
    we can use the latest technology. Smart could also encompass ways of thinking,
    techniques and approaches. However, true smart, is about combining humans with
    technology to perform activities more effectively, about human software and technological
    hardware R15 Smart home technologies are digitally enabled devices that provide
    opportunities to manage energy better. Where the digital component is key. Currently
    lots of things are called “smart” but are meaningless, it generally means moving
    from analogue to digital. R16 Smart home technologies are connected interfaces
    or appliances within buildings that can be used to improve energy management.
    R17 Smart home technologies need to have a learning algorithm through a machine
    that is connected to the internet and can do things like predictive maintenance
    or predictive behavior to better manage cooling and heating within buildings R18
    A product or service that reacts to data either related to the households or external
    information, such as energy prices. R19 Products or services that involve connectivity,
    digitalisation and automation. These could apply to energy use, lightning, electricity
    or gas. R20 Smart homes technologies typically require a digital intermediary
    that is connected to the internet and a set of hardware which is by design insecure
    and not updatable. What smart homes could do, is to automatically manage your
    energy and automatically configure itself in order to provide the service that
    the user wants. Smart homes should use energy and –potentially water-- as efficiently,
    effectively, flexibly and as simple as possible. R21 Smart home technologies are
    devices that automatically recognize the behavior and changes in the environment
    based on the use of preferences and act on predefine routes to do something. As
    a result, users do not need to program them anymore. These technologies'' main
    goals are to improve the energy utilization, comfort and safety of the home. R22
    Smart home technology is whatever the company is telling consumers about what
    it is manufacturing. Hence, it is usually presented as what kit/technology the
    manufacturer has in their portfolio. A smart home should give users a lot of energy
    services, for little energy use R23 Smart home technologies is anything that is
    using data above and beyond of what that piece of kit might usually do. Any device
    that enables that service. R24 Smart home technologies are everyday domestic objects
    that are networked to other technologies. R25 Smart home technologies are devices
    that improve the energy service delivered to the consumer and/or maintaining whilst
    delivering a service to the system. There are two different types of smart technologies.
    One type, assumes virtually no interaction with the consumer and they will only
    become widespread if are accepted and adopted by consumers. The second type, consists
    an additional functionality for the user. R26 Smart home technologies are pieces
    of kits; whether a hardware or software that allow someone who lives or stays
    in the home to control features related to energy. Either the user controls it
    or delegates control to a system. The system could be within the home or it could
    be a national, regional or an international system where the smart component aims
    at enhancing the system. R27 Smart home technologies are connected devices in
    one form or another that provide a service that uses available data in a new way.
    The smartness comes from been able to interpret the data available by an algorithm
    that brings useful elements in one way or another. The “smartness” comes from
    recognizing what is unusual behavior and behavior that should brought to the attention
    of someone. R28 Smart home technologies are devices that collect data and send
    it back to the consumers through different channels of communication, could be
    through a text message, call, voice, emails or displayed on websites. Smart home
    technologies should also be able to be controlled remotely and provide users with
    the ability to stay close to the appliances without been physically there. These
    technologies should also be able to be programmed to provide more comfort to users.
    I see them as a as a platform of information in which users can be coached whilst
    delivering better services to the population. R29 A smart home should allow users
    to control the energy load in the house by looking at vectors in the following
    order: heat, motion, lightning and communication. Controlling those in a manner
    responsive to three elements: the first been commercial signals, essentially energy
    prices; the second is the ability to deliver the energy requirements to the home
    in a commercially efficient manner, so it is closely associated to automation;
    and third, it is responsive not only to commercial signals, but to ambient-environmental
    signals. R30 The use of ICT on how we control and manage our homes. The utilization
    of ICT by various apps and other technologies to control and manage our homes
    more intelligently. So it could be linked to energy or not. R31 Smart home technology
    is a lifestyle opportunity that enables users to make things simpler and easier
    whilst improving lifestyles. However, the smartness goes beyond technology, it
    also entails data services which sit around and are overlooked behind the infrastructure.

    \ governance scholarship has focused attention on the importance of government\
    \ openness [26], \n[34]. Since the 1960s, Freedom of Information (FOI) legislation\
    \ has formed the backbone of institutional support for \nopening information and\
    \ documents [76] and participatory processes [4], [79]. However, FOI represents\
    \ a passive \napproach to releasing information. Persons or organizations must\
    \ still request the information they want, referred to \ncasually, as freedom\
    \ of information requests. Since the 1990s, publishing documents on websites or\
    \ using \ncommunication technologies to engage citizens in participation processes\
    \ has signaled a more proactive approach to \nreleasing government information\
    \ and political engagement. Since 2003, governments have re-envisioned their \n\
    passive and proactive approaches to include an open data agenda, [18], [62], where\
    \ publishing documents and data \nin open formats, [35], [63] is the preferred\
    \ way. Collectively, these developments have forged the basis for what has \n\
    been commonly referred to as the open government and data movements [30]. \n \n\
    Open data practices and policies are praised for their potential to generate public\
    \ value, particularly through \ninnovation, economic growth, and transparency,\
    \ [5], [9], [18], [21], [81]. The nature and character of open data has \nbeen\
    \ hailed for its innovative capacity and transformative power [19], [35], [40],\
    \ [45], [80]. Various studies have \nconfirmed that proactively releasing public\
    \ and private data in open formats creates considerable benefits for citizens,\
    \ \nresearchers, companies and other stakeholders, such as business creation or\
    \ having the ability to understand public \nor private problems in new ways through\
    \ advanced data analytics, [5], [9], [18], [21], [81]. Only a handful of articles\
    \ \nexamine both the unintended consequences and negative side effects of opening\
    \ data, [33] and the underlying \ncausal mechanisms that actually lead to the\
    \ desired open data benefits [5]. Open data research is still in its infancy,\
    \ \nand as a result, the extant literature uses limited application and development\
    \ of theory toward understanding the \nopen data phenomenon. While scholars acknowledge\
    \ diverse perspectives, it is not clear which theories are most \nrelevant, nor\
    \ whether a single or integrated theory is needed.   \n \nThis special issue is\
    \ part of a series of two special issues about open data. This issue focuses on\
    \ the relationship \nbetween innovation and open data, while the second special\
    \ issue emphasizes research on open data related to \ntransparency and open data\
    \ policies. To realize the practical benefits of this transformative practice\
    \ and to develop \ntheory, more research needs to focus on understanding how innovation\
    \ occurs through open data activities. The \npapers in this special issue begin\
    \ to address this gap. The introductory article discusses the state-of-the-art\
    \ with \nrespect to understanding the context of open data innovation, developments,\
    \ challenges and barriers, presents an \noverview of open data research and outlines\
    \ emerging research directions.  \nThe Context of Open Data Innovation \nOpen\
    \ data not only creates possibilities for private sector innovation, but also\
    \ for public sector innovation. A \nsubstantial body of research concentrates\
    \ on innovation in the private sector [77], while the public sector is often \n\
    considered less amenable to innovation [7]. The literature characterizes innovation\
    \ as a purposive act or set of acts \naiming to do something better, to meet a\
    \ new need, or respond to new circumstances [77]. Innovation can be defined \n\
    as “a complex, diversified activity with many interacting components, and sources\
    \ of data need to reflect this” [64]. p. \n7. Schumpeter [69]  lists several types\
    \ of innovations, including the introduction of a new product or a change in an\
    \ \nexisting product; a process innovation that is new to an industry, opening\
    \ a new market, development of new \nsources of supply for raw materials or other\
    \ inputs, or any change in an industrial organization.  \n \nEach innovation type\
    \ is potentially relevant for research involving open government data. Public\
    \ sector innovation \nconcentrates on using new ideas that create value for society\
    \ [2] through the creation of new ventures, business \nmodels and innovative services.\
    \ Provisioning data in open formats has the potential to enable different types\
    \ of \ninnovation, such as new processes in collecting, processing, and using\
    \ the data to enable changes in transparency, \naccountability, and collaborative\
    \ governance. Transparency, efficiency and accountability are mechanisms that\
    \ drive \n \n \nII \nAnneke Zuiderwijk  \nNatalie Helbig \nJ. Ramón Gil-García\

    \ data through innovations that create new products, services and models of \n\
    service delivery, or engagements with citizens. Public sector innovation is not\
    \ new for example, [32], [55], however, a \nmore conscious and systematic approach\
    \ to foster innovation has been emphasized recently to address societal \nchallenges\
    \ [2]. Research demonstrates that innovative activities must be supported by a\
    \ public sector innovation \necosystem [ibid].  \nPerspectives on Open Data \n\
    Seven different perspectives are currently reflected in the literature, although\
    \ most articles use a single perspective \nto study open data. Combining perspectives\
    \ may be more effective in dealing with the issues related to open data \nand\
    \ stimulating innovation. Figure 1 provides a picture of the various perspectives\
    \ – legislative, political, social, \neconomical, institutional, operational,\
    \ and technical [37]. A legislative perspective emphasizes how open data \nlegislation,\
    \ including freedom of information acts, open data policies, open government directives,\
    \ memorandums \nand declarations, are important. A political perspective emphasizes\
    \ the importance of political developments and \npolitical differences between\
    \ countries. A social perspective brings into focus the importance of cultural\
    \ differences \nbetween countries and differences in agendas related to the social\
    \ benefits of opening data, such as transparency \nand accountability. An economical\
    \ perspective points at the financial benefits and gain which can be created with\
    \ \nopen data. It includes studies estimating the impact of reuse of open data,\
    \ often estimated in billions of euros \nannually [20]. Innovation is seen as\
    \ an important driver for stimulating economic growth. An institutional perspective\
    \ \nexamines the ways that institutions enable and constrain the publication and\
    \ adoption of open data, such as the \nbarriers of use from a data provider’s\
    \ point of view [37]. Institutional analysis reveals the importance of examining\
    \ \nhow the publication of data could become an integral part of the data collection\
    \ or creation process, rather than a \nseparate activity which is not integrated\
    \ in the daily procedures and routines  [82], [85]. An operational perspective\
    \ \nfocuses attention on the use of open data and the requirements for being able\
    \ to use open data. Standards are cited \nas important for open data operations\
    \ [78]. Finally, a technical perspective emphasizes the importance of open data\
    \ \ntechnologies, open data platforms and open data infrastructures. It highlights\
    \ the features of open data \ninfrastructures as important, such as visualisation\
    \ and analysis features [29] and the metadata that are required to \nenable the\
    \ reuse of open data [13].  \n \nOpen Data\nLegal \nperspective\nPolitical \n\

    \ 1: Perspectives on open data \nComplexities of Open Data Innovations \nStimulating\
    \ innovation in general is not easy [43]. Likewise, stimulating innovation through\
    \ the open data process \n[86], the efforts required to create, open, find, and\
    \ use open data, are equally complex. The complexities emerge \nfrom several factors,\
    \ including the large number of actors involved in the process, the variety of\
    \ social and technical \ncontexts, uncertainty surrounding how open data will\
    \ be used, and the difficulty valuing intangible impacts generated \nthrough open\
    \ data innovation.   \n \nFirst, many stakeholders are involved in open data processes\
    \ [12], [33], including open data providers, open data \nlegislators, open data\
    \ facilitators and many different types of open data users, such as citizens,\
    \ researchers, \njournalists, developers, entrepreneurs, archivists or librarians\
    \ [31]. These stakeholders have various interests and \nthese interests may conflict\
    \ [33]. For instance, a journalist may want access to and to use sensitive data\
    \ which he or \nshe would report on in an article through the news media, whereas\
    \ a government open data provider will typically not \npublish sensitive data\
    \ because of various legal and personal privacy constraints. This example demonstrates\
    \ that the \nstakeholders are often loosely connected, and in some respects, dependent\
    \ on each other’s activities. The ability for \njournalists to use open data depends\
    \ on whether open data providers publish the data. However, each stakeholder \n\
    remains focused on their own activities, often performing them in non-standardized\
    \ ways. The non-standardization \nreduces the interconnectivity between each other’s\
    \ activities and the opportunity to innovate within the open data \nprocess is\
    \ likely lessened [82]. Learning from how users actually use their data is another\
    \ potential opportunity for \n \n \nIII \nAnneke Zuiderwijk  \nNatalie Helbig\

    \ in the process. Currently, governments find it difficult to monitor use and\
    \ few tools exist to monitor how \nand in what ways open data is used.   \n \n\
    Second, there are a variety of contexts which play a part in the open data process\
    \ [14], including legal [44] and \ncultural [59], and the variety of data content\
    \ and types. Different types of data, with different content, may need a \ndifferent\
    \ legal, cultural, or technical treatment. Each context has its own set of characteristics\
    \ which influences the \nway that open data are collected, disseminated, used\
    \ and interpreted. For example, using data on crimes committed \nin a city will\
    \ likely need different levels of privacy protection and interpretation of meaning\
    \ than would data about \nplayground locations within cities or tree types geocoded\
    \ by city streets.  \n \nThird, the publication and use processes of open data\
    \ are complex [33], [83], [88] and it is not easy to predict how \nusers will\
    \ use open data, when they will use it, and how it will be used in the future\
    \ [51]. For example, government \nagencies may avoid publishing open data as a\
    \ risk aversion strategy. The risk aversion is driven by their uncertainty \n\
    in how the data will ultimately be used or combined with other data.  \n \nFourth,\
    \ understanding how value is created from open data innovation is not straightforward,\
    \ particularly how public \nvalue is generated. Public value is not a new term,\
    \ but a growing literature examines its definition and characteristics \nfor instance,\
    \ [42], [53]-[54], [56], [74]. Public value is seen as the  product  of governmentally\
    \ produced  benefits \nwhere  public  value  is  derived  from  the  direct usefulness,\
    \ fairness, and equitability of  such  benefits to a variety \nof stakeholders\
    \ [30]. p. 5. There are many levels of public value observation – individual,\
    \ group, institutional, and \nsocietal [10] and often value created from transparency,\
    \ accountability, and collaboration are intangible impacts such \nas trust, well-being,\
    \ or being more informed. These are important impacts, but they are not easily\
    \ measured. The \nuncertainty surrounding the value of innovation through open\
    \ data makes it a risky investment.   \n \nThe complex nature of the open data\
    \ process, and innovation processes, complicate the supply and use of open \n\
    data and these complexities are often not taken into account by stakeholders.\
    \ As a result, the potential of the open \ndata process is not completely exploited\
    \  [82]. \nResearch on Open Data \nIn the last decade open data research has gained\
    \ more attention due to the European Public Sector Information \ndirective of\
    \ 2003 [18], Obama’s Memorandum for the Heads of executive Departments and Agencies\
    \  [62]  and other \nopen data policy documents at the international [72] and\
    \ municipal levels for example, [28], [46]. Figure 2 shows the \nnumber of publications\
    \ on open data from 1974 to 2012 in the databases Scopus, Science Direct, IEEE\
    \ Xplore and \nACM Digital Library. The number of publications refers to those\
    \ publications that used the combination of the terms \nopen data in either the\
    \ title, abstract, or keywords of the paper. A limitation is that this search\
    \ does not include \nsearching through the full text of the articles. Scopus reveals\
    \ articles with the terms open data in the title, keyword or \nabstract written\
    \ from 1974, IEEE Xplore from 1983, ACM Digital Library from 1986 and Science\
    \ Direct from 1990. \nMost open data publications were found in Scopus. The graph\
    \ clearly shows an increasing number of open data \npublications particularly\
    \ after 2000, with a sharp increase in 2009.   \n \n \n \nFigure 2: Publications\

    \ were mainly conceptual papers, descriptions of the \nempirical uses of open\

    \ to explain \nchanges or patterns received considerably less attention. The papers\
    \ for review were collected by searching for \nopen data, open link data and open\

    \ examine whether and what type of \ntheory was used in a paper, we searched for\
    \ the term theory in each paper and scanned the abstract and conclusion \nsections.\
    \ Out of the 143 papers, only 19 papers explicitly used, stated, or developed\
    \ theories.  \n \nTable 1 summarizes which theories are mentioned, used and developed\
    \ and the related topics examined in the open \ndata field in the 19 papers. We\
    \ operationalized the mentioning of theory as any mention of that theory at least\
    \ once. \nWe operationalized the use or extension of theory as any paper that\
    \ refers to the use of a theory by applying it to a \ncertain open data topic.\
    \ \n \nWe found that of the 19 articles, many were written by the same authors\
    \ and that only a very small group of \nresearchers are involved in theory development\
    \ in the field to-date. Out of the 24 authors that were involved in \nwriting\
    \ these 19 papers, 8 authors were involved in writing two or more of the 19 papers.\
    \ From this group, however, \nthey have explored many different types of theories,\
    \ and only rarely was the same theory used more than twice. \nInstitutional and\
    \ organizational theories and democratic theories were used several times. Institutional\
    \ and \norganizational theories were used to investigate policy development, changing\
    \ systems, and changing organizational \ncultures and structures. Democratic theories\
    \ were used to investigate transparency and trust and participation. In \naddition,\

    \ data was a topic that had been \ninvestigated often, as compared to the other\

    \ \nUpon further investigation of the use of theory in these 19 articles, we found\
    \ that only one reference could be found \nin the literature and in almost half\
    \ of the publications, the theory is mentioned only to justify a statement. For\
    \ several \ntopics in the area of open data, we could not find papers having a\
    \ theoretical foundation, such as standard \ndevelopment, efficiency benefits,\
    \ or economic growth. For instance, our selection of 143 papers did not include\
    \ any \npapers with theoretical foundations for the design of open data infrastructures.\
    \  \n \nThere are various potential explanations for why we see these patterns.\
    \ First, different theories are used in open \ndata research to incorporate the\
    \ variety of perspectives – legal, social and technical. Different theories are\
    \ needed \nfor different perspectives on open data. For example, one theory may\
    \ explain the adoption of open data, but not the \nprocess in which open data\
    \ are published or the way that policies are created. For this reason, only a\
    \ multi-theory \napproach can take into account a diversity of perspectives. Second,\
    \ a diversity of theories for open data is likely to \nexist because it is an\
    \ emerging phenomenon and it is not clear which theories are relevant to the field.\
    \ For example, \nwe found only one paper examining theoretical foundations for\
    \ the topic “power relations and power structures” [5]. \nMore research is needed\
    \ to investigate this theory and to show in which context this theory can be used\
    \ in the field \nof open data. This special issue contributes to filling this\
    \ gap, as four out of the seven papers of this special issue \ndescribe the use\
    \ of one or more theories in open data research. \nDevelopments, Challenges and\
    \ Barriers \nPublic and private organizations increasingly publish their data\
    \ on the internet [27], [49], [52]. Open data is the result \nof publishing data\
    \ in so-called open data infrastructures. Currently, open data infrastructures\
    \ are being adopted at a \nrapid pace by different levels of government [89].\
    \ For instance, open data infrastructures have been developed by \nlocal, national,\
    \ and international public and private organizations (e.g. municipalities, ministries,\
    \ federal governments, \nthe European Commission and non-country specific organizations)\
    \ [ibid]. Various open data policies have been \ndeveloped as well. Many organizations\
    \ want to jump on the bandwagon and join the open data community [84]. Yet, \n\
    the publication and use of open data is still accompanied with many barriers [37],\
    \ [82]-[83], [86]. In [86], 118 barriers \nfor open data were identified. The\
    \ barriers were divided into ten categories, namely 1) availability and access,\
    \ 2) \nfind-ability, 3) usability, 4) understand-ability, 5) quality, 6) linking\
    \ and combining data, 7) comparability and \ncompatibility, 8) metadata, 9) interaction\
    \ with the data provider, and 10) opening and uploading. Most barriers \nconcerned\
    \ the use of open data. This research revealed that little attention is paid to\
    \ the user perspective, which is \nlikely to inhibit innovation. The users need\
    \ to generate value from open data [84],  [86].  \n \nFigure 3 presents examples\
    \ of barriers for open data processes from the eight perspectives highlighted\
    \ in Figure 1. \nThe barrier overview is based on the literature review of barriers\
    \ and interviews and workshops about barriers \ndescribed in [37], [86] and on\
    \ other literature about barriers for example, [82]-[83]. There are many diverse\
    \ barriers in \neach perspective, suggesting the need for research from each of\
    \ these perspectives.  \n \n \n \n \nVI \nAnneke Zuiderwijk  \nNatalie Helbig\

    The previous sections of this introduction highlighted what has been accomplished,\
    \ but also revealed that significant \nresearch remains to be conducted. In this\
    \ section we identify a number of topics that lead to an emerging open data \n\
    research agenda categorized by three main topics – 1) open data theory and development,\
    \ 2) open data policies, \nuse, and innovation, and 3) open data infrastructures\
    \ and technologies (See Figure 4).   \n \nOpen Data Research Directions\n3. Open\
    \ data infrastructures and \ntechnology\n1. Open data \ntheory and \ndevelopment\n\
    2. Open data policies, use and \ninnovation\n \n \nFigure 4: Proposal for open\
    \ data research directions \nOpen Data Theory and Development \nTable 1 highlighted\
    \ the few articles and researchers examining the theoretical foundations for open\
    \ data research. At \nthe same time, the summary also demonstrated the diversity\
    \ of theories used. Which theories are relevant in which \ncontext and to understand\
    \ which phenomena is not clear yet. Future research should investigate the appropriateness\
    \ \nof using the presented theories for open data, the benefit of taking these\
    \ theoretical views, and to find out whether, \nand within which context, the\
    \ theories can be used to understand open data. Additionally, it is important\
    \ to \ninvestigate whether theories can be unified and whether an overarching\
    \ meta theory can be developed. Furthermore, \nother theories that have not been\
    \ investigated to-date may be more appropriate for application in the field of\
    \ open \ndata, some examples include: the unified theory of acceptance and use\
    \ of technology, information system (IS) \nsuccess model theories, organizational\
    \ information processing theory, the theory of planned behavior and \nadministrative\
    \ behavior theory. Moreover, design theory of services and infrastructures is\
    \ a topic that is relevant for \ncreating value from open data innovation and\
    \ is not addressed to-date.  \n \nIn sum, only few papers to-date contribute to\
    \ theory building and there is not a dominating theory. The diversity in the \n\
    use of theories suggests that there are many opportunities for theory development\
    \ in the field of open data that have \nnot been explored sufficiently. The field\
    \ is in its beginning stage and theoretical contributions are still scarce.  \n\
    Open Data Policies, Use and Innovation \nFreedom of information legislation and\
    \ specific directives represent the legal and political landscape of open data\
    \ \npolicies to-date. The following is an elaboration of where specific research\
    \ areas regarding policies, process \nmanagement, innovation and stimulation of\
    \ use that we believe will push the field forward. \n \n \nPolicies. Open data\
    \ policies are in place or under development in many different countries world-wide.\
    \ From \na practical point of view, countries may be able to learn from one another\
    \  [84] or countries with no policies \ncan learn from those who are leading the\
    \ way and progressing quickly  [59]. More research on open data \npolicies could\
    \ provide insights in which aspects open data policies should contain in different\
    \ cultural and \nlegal contexts and how open data policies could be implemented\
    \  [59]. \n \nProcess management. Open data are published in different ways and\
    \ it is unclear which ways are effective, \nefficient, and innovative. Although\
    \ some guidelines have been published, further research is necessary to \ninvestigate\
    \ how the processes related to open data publication and use could be managed\
    \ and which \ncoordination mechanisms are appropriate in the context of open data\
    \ publication and use. \n \nInnovation. Very little research has been performed\
    \ on how exactly open data can result in innovation. An \nexample of this research\
    \ comes from Ferro and Osella [24], who describe eight open data business models\
    \ \nwhich are currently employed by private organizations. In another paper, Ferro\
    \ and Osella [23] discuss \nmechanisms which allow for profit-oriented value creation\
    \ based on open governmental data. Although \nsome research has been performed\
    \ on which business models could stimulate innovation [22]-[24], [38], the \n\
    understanding of the open data community on this topic is still limited.  \n \n\

    \ \nDOI: 10.4067/S0718-18762014000200001 \n \nStimulating use. Much of the current\
    \ effort in the field of open data is focused on publishing data on the \ninternet\
    \ by creating open data portals [49], [52], whereas insufficient attention is\
    \ given to the problem of how \ndata can be published and fueled in open data\
    \ portals. Open data policies should focus more on stimulating \nthe use of open\
    \ data, as this is an important factor in creating the intended effects. The use\
    \ of open data \ncan be stimulated, for example, by disseminating and sharing\
    \ open data usage practices among \nstakeholders and by organizing so-called hackatons\
    \ and other types of competitions  [84]. \nOpen Data Infrastructures and Technology\
    \ \nIn addition to the social aspects, technical aspects are also very important\
    \ for open data research. In the following \nwe discuss what kind of research\
    \ is needed concerning infrastructures and technology. \n \n \nInfrastructures\
    \ and functionalities. There is a lack of knowledge about the functionalities\
    \ of open data \ninfrastructures that are required to stimulate the innovative\
    \ use of open data. Research on open data \ninfrastructures and their functionalities\
    \ can be used for comparisons, but it can also be used by developers \nof open\
    \ data infrastructures. Users have different needs and different types of data\
    \ need to be published \nand processed in different ways. Some initial research\
    \ has been performed [87], [89]. For example, \nZuiderwijk, Janssen and Jeffery\
    \ [87]  present an open data e-infrastructure which supports data provision, \n\
    data retrieval and use, data linking, user rating and user cooperation. Moreover,\
    \ Zuiderwijk, Janssen and \nParnia [89]  conducted a systematic analysis of three\
    \ open data infrastructures and identified 35 \nfunctionalities of open data infrastructures.\
    \ Furthermore, they concluded that open data infrastructures can \ncomplement\
    \ each other. \n \nInteroperability. Janssen, Charalabidis, Kuk and Cresswell\
    \ [36] concluded that a lack of interoperability \nresults in limited progress\
    \ in the field of e-government. This also counts for open data interoperability,\
    \ as \nthere are many problems with interoperability in the field of open data\
    \ as well, such as problems with the \ninteroperability of metadata standards,\
    \ licenses, processes and data formats (also see the third paper of \nthis special\
    \ issue by Petychakis, Vasileiou, Georgis, et al. entitled A state-of-the-art\
    \ analysis of current \npublic data landscape from a functional, semantic and\
    \ technical perspective). If the tools and applications \nwhich support the publication\
    \ and use of open data are interoperable, then open data providers and users \n\
    can select and utilize the best functionalities available. If the various open\
    \ data instruments and tools \ncomplement each other and can be integrated, this\
    \ will enable interoperability. By integrating the elements it \nshould become\
    \ easier to use open data and this is likely to lead to more users engaging with\
    \ open data. \nThe use of various tools and applications is a crucial element\
    \ that stimulates innovation in smart \necosystems for open data. \n \nMetadata.\
    \ Metadata are important to stimulate interoperability of open data infrastructures.\
    \ Metadata may \nyield considerable benefits [12], [90]. For instance, metadata\
    \ improve the accessibility of open data for \nothers beyond the primary data\
    \ providers by describing, locating and retrieving the data efficiently [3], [17],\
    \ \n[41], [65], [71], [73].  Metadata improve the ability to find open data, the\
    \ chances to be found by describing \ncontent and becoming searchable [6], [39],\
    \ [57], [70]  and the chances of a correct interpretation of open \ndata by distilling\
    \ knowledge from them [25], [39], [70], [75]. Currently mainly flat metadata,\
    \ i.e. metadata for \nthe discovery of datasets, are used and described in open\
    \ data research, including Dublin Core (DC), \nCKAN (Comprehensive Knowledge Archive\
    \ Network), eGMS (e-Government Metadata Standard) and \nDCAT (Data Catalog). The\
    \ disadvantage of these flat metadata is that they barely provide contextual \n\
    information, which is required to interpret open data. More research is needed\
    \ on the use contextual \nmetadata models, such as CERIF (Common European research\
    \ Information Format). \n \nData quality. Providers and users of open data often\
    \ do not know what the quality of the data is. This may \nbe a formidable barrier\
    \ for using open data in meaningful ways. More research is needed on which \n\
    mechanisms can help in improving data quality and dealing with low data quality,\
    \ such as a quality rating \nsystem for data and so-called seals of approval by\
    \ organizations who published the data. These \nmechanisms can help potential\
    \ open data users in assessing the usefulness of the data for their purposes.\
    \ \nThe fifth paper of this special issue, written by Behkamal, Kahani, Bagheri\
    \ and Jeremic, contributes to filling \nthe data quality research gap (A metrics-driven\
    \ approach for quality assessment of Linked Open Data). \nPaper Overview \nThis\
    \ special issue covers a diversity of subjects related broadly to innovation through\
    \ open data processes. It \nconsists of a collection of papers written by experts\
    \ in this area. In total seven papers were selected for this special \nissue.\
    \ All papers have undergone a rigorous blind review process and were reviewed\
    \ by three reviewers. The papers \ncan be classified in the following three areas:\
    \ 1) the open data landscape, stakeholders, challenges and motivations, \n2) semantic\
    \ interoperability, ontologies and data quality, and 3) value creation: evaluation\
    \ of innovation through open \ndata. \n \n \n \nIX \nAnneke Zuiderwijk  \nNatalie\

    \ \n \nThe Open Data Landscape, Stakeholders, Challenges and Motivations \nThree\
    \ papers in this special issue are related to the open data landscape, stakeholders,\
    \ challenges and motivations. \n \nGoing beyond open data: challenges and motivations\
    \ for smart disclosure in ethical consumption - Djoko \nSigit Sayogo, Jing Zhang,\
    \ Theresa A. Pardo, Giri K. Tayi, Jana Hrdinova, David F. Andersen, and Luis \n\
    Felipe Luna-Reyes. This manuscript reports on the findings of a case study on\
    \ the sustainable coffee supply \nchain. The case is studied to obtain a better\
    \ understanding of challenges faced by data producers as well \nas motivating\
    \ factors for greater openness. Information was gathered through a workshop and\
    \ semi-\nstructured interviews with key stakeholders to explore the challenges,\
    \ motivations and perceived value of \ndata disclosure. The identified challenges\
    \ and motivating factors were grouped into four general areas \ninfluencing smart\
    \ disclosure, namely: market dynamics, information policies, technological capabilities\
    \ and \ndata challenges. \n \nShaping local open data initiatives: politics and\
    \ implications - Josefin Lassinantti, Birgitta Bergvall-Kåreborn \nand Anna Ståhlbröst.\
    \ This article addresses the question of how local open data initiatives can stimulate\
    \ \ninnovation through open data. Two in-depth case studies were conducted in\
    \ the two Swedish municipalities \nStockholm and Skellefteå, and a rich narrative\
    \ is provided about their open data initiatives. The theory of \nSocial Construction\
    \ of Technology (SCOT) is used to analyze the results of the case studies. The\
    \ analysis \nof the cases revealed that their perspectives on open data initiatives\
    \ were different from each other. Two \ndifferent drivers for opening up data\
    \ were identified, namely a techno-economic growth and a co-created \nsocietal\
    \ growth.  \n \nA state-of-the-art analysis of current public data landscape from\
    \ a functional, semantic and technical \nperspective – Michael Petychakis, Olga\
    \ Vasileiou, Charilaos Georgis, Spiros Mouzakitis and John Psarras. \nThis paper\
    \ provides a broad overview of open government data sources from all the countries\
    \ of the \nEuropean Union. The authors analyzed the type of data source, the language,\
    \ the coverage, the license \nand the metadata standard that are used by each\
    \ of these open government data sources. Additionally, for \nthe countries United\
    \ Kingdom, France and Greece an in-depth analysis of the open data sources is\
    \ \nperformed. The analysis shows that the quality of the investigated government\
    \ data sources varies \nsignificantly depending on the country and the data provider.\
    \ Moreover, many datasets are not completely \nopen, as they have been published\
    \ under restricted or non-specified licenses. Despite these limitations of \n\
    existing open government data portals, the authors conclude that the quality of\
    \ open government \ninfrastructures is steadily improving. \nSemantic Interoperability,\
    \ Ontologies and Data Quality \nThe following two papers were accepted in the\
    \ category semantic interoperability, ontologies and data quality. \n \nUsing\
    \ a method and tool for hybrid ontology engineering: an evaluation in the Flemish\
    \ Research Information \nSpace - Christophe Debruyne and Pieter de Leenheer. This\
    \ paper describes a method to create ontologies \nin which the stakeholder community\
    \ becomes an integral part of the ontology and ontology-engineering \nprocess,\
    \ as well as the natural language definitions of concepts. These ontologies are\
    \ referred to as hybrid \nontologies. An experiment was conducted in which the\
    \ participants used the method to build ontologies to \nestablish semantic interoperability\
    \ between various research information systems and to annotate the data \nof an\
    \ existing system provided by a public administration. \n \nA metrics-driven approach\
    \ for quality assessment of linked open data - Behshid Behkamal, Mohsen Kahani,\
    \ \nEbrahim Bagheri and Zoran Jeremic. The fifth paper in this special issue proposes\
    \ a set of metrics for \nevaluating the inherent quality characteristics of open\
    \ data. The metrics can be used to assess datasets \nbefore they are released\
    \ to the Linked Open Data Cloud. Measurement theory and software measurement \n\
    techniques are used to assess the quality of datasets. Various quality characteristics\
    \ of datasets can be \nassessed, for instance, to help data publishing agencies\
    \ in evaluating their data. Additionally, users of open \ndata can use the quality\
    \ metrics to assess the quality of the data that they may want to use and to filter\
    \ out \npoor quality data. \nValue Creation: Evaluation of Innovation through\
    \ Open Data \nFinally, two papers concerning value creation were included in this\
    \ special issue. They can be summarized as \nfollows. \n \nOpen \ngovernment \n\
    data \nimplementation \nevaluation \n- \nPeter \nParycek, \nJohann \nHöchtl \n\

    \ online at \nwww.jtaer.com \nDOI: 10.4067/S0718-18762014000200001 \nparticular,\
    \ namely the Open Data strategy by the City of Vienna. After this city implemented\
    \ its open data \nstrategy, the authors conducted qualitative interviews and surveys.\
    \ The results of this research show that \nvarious benefits can be obtained for\
    \ Viennese open data and a number of success factors were identified. \nFive recommendations\
    \ for future open data strategies of other organizations were developed, including\
    \ the \ndevelopment of an appropriate legal framework, harmonization of data sets,\
    \ more stakeholder specific \ntarget group management, education and training\
    \ programs and a CC-BY or a comparatively permissive \nlicense. \n \nData-driven\
    \ innovation through open government data - Thorhildur Jetzek, Michel Avital,\
    \ and Niels Bjorn-\nAndersen. The last paper of this special issue aims to explain\
    \ how the use of open government data can \nstimulate the generation of value.\
    \ A framework with four generative mechanisms is used to explain the \ncomplex\
    \ relationship between openness, data and value. In addition, a critical realist\
    \ approach is used as a \nfoundation for the in-depth study of open government\
    \ data in the Opower case. Enabling factors, innovation \nmechanisms and impacts\
    \ are identified and the study has resulted in a conceptual model for the data\
    \ driven \ninnovation mechanism.  \nThis special issue is aimed at contributing\
    \ to the relationship between innovation and open data. The introductory \narticle\
    \ discussed the state-of-the-art with respect to understanding the context of\
    \ open data innovation, \ndevelopments, challenges and barriers, and presented\
    \ an overview of open data research and outlined emerging \nresearch directions.\
    \ We showed that the number of publications in the area of innovation and open\
    \ data is increasing, \nshowing the timeliness and relevance of this topic. Our\
    \ analysis of open data publications showed that most papers \nare mainly conceptual\
    \ papers, descriptions of the empirical uses of open data or descriptions of the\
    \ design of \ntechnology and systems. Limited attention has been given to theory\
    \ development so far and there is not a \ndominating theory. There are many barriers\
    \ blocking innovation and the use of open data. This resulted in a research \n\
    agenda consisting of three main research themes, namely 1) open data theory and\
    \ development, 2) open data \npolicies, use, and innovation, and 3) open data\
    \ infrastructures and technologies. \n \nEnjoy reading! \nReferences \n[1]  E.\

    \ turned into proﬁtable decisions only when eﬃciently\nmanaged. Current advances\
    \ in data management are making Smart Farming grow exponentially\nas data have\
    \ become the key element in modern agriculture to help producers with critical\n\
    decision-making. Valuable advantages appear with objective information acquired\
    \ through sensors\nwith the aim of maximizing productivity and sustainability.\
    \ This kind of data-based managed farms\nrely on data that can increase eﬃciency\
    \ by avoiding the misuse of resources and the pollution of\nthe environment. Data-driven\
    \ agriculture, with the help of robotic solutions incorporating artiﬁcial\nintelligent\
    \ techniques, sets the grounds for the sustainable agriculture of the future.\
    \ This paper\nreviews the current status of advanced farm management systems by\
    \ revisiting each crucial step,\nfrom data acquisition in crop ﬁelds to variable\
    \ rate applications, so that growers can make optimized\ndecisions to save money\
    \ while protecting the environment and transforming how food will be\nproduced\
    \ to sustainably match the forthcoming population growth.\nKeywords: agriculture\
    \ 4.0; big data; farm management information system (FMIS); robotics; IoT;\nvariable-rate\
    \ technology (VRT); AI\n1. Introduction\nThe agriculture sector is undergoing\
    \ a transformation driven by new technologies, which seems\nvery promising as\
    \ it will enable this primary sector to move to the next level of farm productivity\n\
    and proﬁtability [1]. Precision Agriculture, which consist of applying inputs\
    \ (what is needed) when\nand where is needed, has become the third wave of the\
    \ modern agriculture revolution (the ﬁrst was\nmechanization and the second the\
    \ green revolution with its genetic modiﬁcation [2]), and nowadays,\nit is being\
    \ enhanced with an increase of farm knowledge systems due to the availability\
    \ of larger\namounts of data. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)\
    \ already reported in October\n2016 that Precision Agriculture technologies increased\
    \ net returns and operating proﬁts [3]. Also,\nwhen considering the environment,\
    \ new technologies are increasingly being applied in the farms\nto maintain the\
    \ sustainability of farm production. However, the adoption of these technologies\n\
    involves uncertainty and trade-oﬀs. According to a market analysis, the factors\
    \ that would facilitate\nthe adoption of sustainable farming technologies include\
    \ better education and training of farmers,\nsharing of information, easy availability\
    \ of ﬁnancial resources, and increasing consumer demand\nfor organic food [4].\
    \ When applying these new technologies, the challenge for retrieving data from\n\
    crops is to come out with something coherent and valuable, because data themselves\
    \ are not useful,\njust numbers or images. Farms that decide to be technology-driven\
    \ in some way, show valuable\nadvantages, such us saving money and work, having\
    \ an increased production or a reduction of costs\nwith minimal eﬀort, and producing\
    \ quality food with more environmentally friendly practices [5].\nHowever, taking\
    \ these advantages to the farm will depend, not only on the willingness of producers\n\

    Agronomy 2020, 10, 207\n2 of 21\nfor adopting new technologies in their ﬁelds,\
    \ but also on each speciﬁc farm potential in terms of scale\neconomies, as proﬁt\
    \ margin increases with farm size. The USDA reported that, on average, corn\n\
    farm operating proﬁt of Precision Agriculture adopters was 163 dollars per hectare\
    \ higher than for\nnon-adopters, taking into account that the highest adoption\
    \ rates for three technologies (computer\nmapping, guidance, and variable-rate\
    \ equipment) were on farms over 1500 hectares [3]. Such margins\ncan even go up\
    \ to 272 dollars depending on the crop. A greater use of Smart Farming services\
    \ is vital\nto not only improving a farm’s ﬁnancial performance, but also to meet\
    \ the food needs of an expanding\npopulation [6].\nThe ﬁnal purpose of this paper\
    \ is to demonstrate how making decisions with the modern\ndata-based agriculture\
    \ available today can lead to sustainable and proﬁtable actuation to nourish\n\
    people while reducing harm to the environment. In order to evaluate how modern\
    \ agriculture can help\nin a sustainable decision-making process, this article\
    \ revisits the main steps of an information-based\nagriculture and focuses on\
    \ data management systems by reviewing recent applications related to each\ncrucial\
    \ step, from data acquisition in crop ﬁelds to the execution of tasks with variable\
    \ rate equipment.\n2. Data-Driven Agriculture: Agriculture 4.0\nThis new philosophy\
    \ centered on agricultural data has been expressed with several names:\nAgriculture\
    \ 4.0, Digital Farming, or Smart Farming, and was born when telematics and data\
    \ management\nwere combined to the already known concept of Precision Agriculture,\
    \ improving the accuracy of\noperations [7]. As a result, Agriculture 4.0 is based\
    \ on Precision Agriculture principles with producers\nusing systems that generate\
    \ data in their farms, which will be processed in such a way to make proper\n\
    strategical and operational decisions. Traditionally, farmers have gone to the\
    \ ﬁelds to check the status\nof their crops and make decisions based on their\
    \ accumulated experience. This approach is no longer\nsustainable as, among other\
    \ reasons, some ﬁelds are too large to be eﬃciently managed according to\nthe\
    \ threefold criteria that will lead the coming years: Eﬃciency, sustainability\
    \ and availability (for\npeople). Advanced management systems within the context\
    \ of Smart Farming are providing practical\nsolutions. Also, despite some farmers\
    \ have a long-time experience gathered after many years of work\nin the ﬁeld,\
    \ technology may provide a systematic tool to detect unforeseen problems hard\
    \ to notice\nby visual inspection on occasional checks. Regarding the willingness\
    \ of adopting modern tools in\nagriculture, young farmers show a more positive\
    \ attitude than elder ones, as the former can support\ntheir not-so-large experience\
    \ in the ﬁeld with new smart tools providing key information. However,\nthe average\
    \ age of farmers in the last decades has been alarmingly increasing: Around 58\
    \ years old in\nthe USA and Europe, 60 in sub-Saharan Africa, or 63 in Japan [8,9].\
    \ Fortunately, this trend is expected\nto change. Several European policies, for\
    \ example, are being set to support a generational renewal,\nfacilitating access\
    \ to initial investment, loans, business advice, and training [9]. A generational\
    \ renewal\nin a rural development context goes beyond a reduction in the average\
    \ age of farmers; it is also about\nempowering a new generation of highly qualiﬁed\
    \ young farmers to bring the full beneﬁts of technology\nin order to support sustainable\
    \ farming practices [10]. This implies that young farmers will need to\ntransform\
    \ the existing land to more modern and competitive farms with the purpose of maintaining\n\
    viable food production while improving the competitiveness of the agrifood chain,\
    \ because with\nadvanced technologies and new thinking, young people can transform\
    \ the agricultural sector [8].\n2.1. Internet of Things: Collecting Information\n\
    Internet of things (IoT) in an agricultural context refers to the use of sensors\
    \ and other devices to\nturn every element and action involved in farming into\
    \ data. It has been reported that an estimation\nof a 10% to 15% of US farmers\
    \ are using IoT solutions on the farm across 1200 million hectares and\n250,000\
    \ farms [11]. IoT drives Agriculture 4.0 [12]; in fact, IoT technologies is one\
    \ of the reasons why\nagriculture can generate such a big amount of valuable information,\
    \ and the agriculture sector is\nexpected to be highly inﬂuenced by the advances\
    \ in these technologies [13]. It is estimated that, with\nnew techniques, the\
    \ IoT has the potential to increase agricultural productivity by 70% by 2050 [14],\n\
    Agronomy 2020, 10, 207\n3 of 21\nwhich is positive, because according to Myklevy\
    \ et al., the world needs to increase global food\nproduction by 60% by 2050 due\
    \ to a population growth over nine thousand million [15]. The main\nadvantages\
    \ of the use of IoT are achieving higher crop yields and less cost. For example,\
    \ studies from\nOnFarm found that for an average farm using IoT, yield rises by\
    \ 1.75% and energy costs drop 17 to\n32 dollars per hectare, while water use for\
    \ irrigation falls by 8% [12].\n2.2. Big Data: Analysis of Massive Data\nIn the\
    \ current technology-based era, the concept of big data is present in many economic\
    \ sectors,\nbut is it already available to agriculture?\nThe ever-growing amount\
    \ of data available for ﬁeld\nmanagement makes necessary the implementation of\
    \ some type of automatic process to extract\noperational information from bulk\
    \ data. However, the volume of data currently retrieved from most\ncommercial\
    \ ﬁelds is, arguably, not yet at the level considered to be classiﬁed as big data.\
    \ According to\nManyica et al. [16], big data has three dimensions: Volume, velocity,\
    \ and variety. Kunisch [17] added a\nfourth V for veracity. Finally, a ﬁfth V\
    \ was added by Chi et al. for the extra dimension valorization [18].\nOverall,\
    \ the ﬁve V (dimensions) of big data stand for:\n•\nVolume refers to datasets\
    \ whose size is beyond the ability of typical database software tools to\ncapture,\
    \ store, manage, and analyze information. This deﬁnition includes an estimate\
    \ of how big\na dataset needs to be in order to be considered big, and it can\
    \ vary by study sector, depending on\nsoftware tools that are commonly available\
    \ and common sizes of datasets, typically starting in the\nterabyte range [16].\n\
    •\nVelocity refers to the capability to acquire, understand and interpret events\
    \ as they occur.\nIn agriculture, this would refer to applications that occur\
    \ in real time, like data being processed\nright in the ﬁeld to apply variable\
    \ rates of chemicals in equipment featuring variable rate\napplication technologies.\n\
    •\nVariety refers to the diﬀerent data formats (videos, text, voice), and the\
    \ diverse degrees of\ncomplexity. This situation is not strange in agriculture\
    \ when diﬀerent data sources are used to\nwork in complex scenarios such as images\
    \ and soil or weather probes.\n•\nVeracity refers to the quality, reliability,\
    \ and overall conﬁdence of the data.\n•\nValorization is the ability to propagate\
    \ knowledge, appreciation and innovation [18].\nIn the context of crop management,\
    \ Kunisch [17] concluded that big data is applicable only in\nsome cases in agriculture,\
    \ depending on each farm and its level of technology adoption. Nevertheless,\n\
    the Proagrica [19] report conﬁrmed that big data was being increasingly applied\
    \ in the agriculture\nsector. Kamilaris et al. [18] cited 34 works where big data\
    \ was used in agricultural applications, and\nWolfert et al. [20] published a\
    \ review on big data applications in Smart Farming. In line with this\ntrend,\
    \ the Consortium of International Agricultural Research Centers (CGIAR, Montpellier,\
    \ France)\ncreated a Platform for Big Data in Agriculture with the purpose of\
    \ using big data approaches to solve\nagricultural development problems faster,\
    \ better, and at a greater scale than before [21].\n2.3. Agriculture 5.0: Robotics\
    \ and Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) to Help in Nourishing People\nBig engineering\
    \ challenges typically spur big solutions through disruptive technologies,\nand\
    \ Agriculture 5.0 is probably the one for the ﬁrst half of the 21st Century. The\
    \ concept Agriculture\n5.0 implies that farms are following Precision Agriculture\
    \ principles and using equipment that involves\nunmanned operations and autonomous\
    \ decision support systems. Thus, Agriculture 5.0 implies the use\nof robots and\
    \ some forms of AI [22]. By tradition, farms have needed many workers, mostly\
    \ seasonal,\nto harvest crops and keep farms productive. However, society has\
    \ moved away from being an agrarian\nsociety with large quantities of people living\
    \ in farms to people living in cities now; as a result, farms\nare facing the\
    \ challenge of a workforce shortage. One solution to help with this shortage of\
    \ workers is\nagricultural robots integrating AI features. According to a Forbes\
    \ study [23], farm robots augment\nthe human labor workforce and can harvest crops\
    \ at a higher volume and faster pace than human\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 207\n4 of\
    \ 21\nlaborers. Although there are still many cases in which robots are not as\
    \ fast as humans, agriculture is\ncurrently developing robotic systems to work\
    \ in the ﬁeld and help producers with tedious tasks [24–27],\npushing agricultural\
    \ systems to the new concept of Agriculture 5.0. According to Reddy et al. [28],\n\
    the advent of robots in agriculture drastically increased the productivity in\
    \ several countries and\nreduced the farm operating costs. As said before, robotic\
    \ applications for agriculture are growing\nexponentially [27], which oﬀers promising\
    \ solutions for Smart Farming in handling labor shortage and\na long-time declining\
    \ proﬁtability; however, like most innovations, there exist important limitations\n\
    to cope with at the current early stages. These technologies are still too expensive\
    \ for most farmers,\nespecially those with small farms [29], because scale economics\
    \ make small individual farms less\nproﬁtable [30]. Nevertheless, the cost of\
    \ technology decreases with time, and agricultural robots will be\nsurely implemented\
    \ in the future as the alternative to bring about higher production [4,31]. The\
    \ world\nagricultural production and crop yields slowed down in 2015. The concept\
    \ of agricultural robotics\nwas introduced to overcome these problems and satisfy\
    \ the rising demand for high yields. Robotic\ninnovations are giving a boost to\
    \ the global agriculture and crop production market, as according to\nthe Veriﬁed\
    \ Market Intelligence report, agricultural robots will be capable of completing\
    \ ﬁeld tasks\nwith greater eﬃciency as compared to the farmers [32].\nAgricultural\
    \ tech startups have raised over 800 million dollars in the last ﬁve years [31].\
    \ Startups\nusing robotics and machine learning to solve problems in agriculture\
    \ started gaining momentum in\n2014, in line with a rising interest in AI [33].\
    \ In fact, venture capital funding in AI has increased by 450%\nin the last 5\
    \ years [34]. This kind of new agriculture pretends to do more with less, because\
    \ nourishing\npeople while increasing production sustainably and taking care of\
    \ the environment will be crucial in\nthe coming years, as the Food and Agriculture\
    \ Organization of the United Nations (FAO) estimates\nthat, in 2050, there will\
    \ be a world population of 9.6 billion [35]. Advanced sensing technologies in\n\
    agriculture can help to meet the challenge; they provide detailed information\
    \ on soil, crop status,\nand environmental conditions to allow precise applications\
    \ of phytosanitary products, resulting in a\nreduced used of herbicides and pesticides,\
    \ improved water use eﬃciency and increased crop yield and\nquality [2].\n3. Data-Driven\
    \ Management for Advanced Farming: Principal Stages\nThe raw measurements of key\
    \ parameters from crops need to be eﬃciently processed so that\nnumbers or images\
    \ unambiguously turn into valuable information. Crop management based on ﬁeld\n\
    data already evolved when Precision Agriculture came to light thirty years ago,\
    \ but it has certainly\nbeen transformed by the present digital information era.\
    \ Traditionally, and in those places where\ntechnology has not arrived yet, ﬁeld\
    \ management consists of visually inspecting the development of\ncrops to reach\
    \ a diagnosis with which farmers make decisions and actuate giving diﬀerent treatments\n\
    to their crops. This approach relies on ﬁeld experience and the information perceived\
    \ through the\neyes of farmers. Additionally, associated growers can follow the\
    \ recommendations of cooperative\ntechnicians or engineers hired by the society\
    \ they belong to. In farms where advanced technology\nhas been implemented, ﬁeld\
    \ management varies according to the operating cycle shown in Figure 1.\nThis\
    \ management system based on objective ﬁeld data and smart decision-making starts\
    \ with the actual\ncrop to manage, taking advantage of its inner variability,\
    \ both spatial-wise and time-wise. The platform\nrefers to the physical means\
    \ with which information is acquired, being the sensors the speciﬁc elements\n\
    through which objective data are obtained. Data includes the information directly\
    \ retrieved from the\nparameters measured from the crop, soil, or ambient. Retrieving\
    \ the data from the sensors can be done\nin multiple ways, from inserting a pen\
    \ drive in a USB port to get the ﬁles [36] to retrieving data from\nsoftware applications\
    \ synchronized to the Internet. The nexus between the data and the decision stage\n\
    involves ﬁltering routines and AI algorithms for getting only the right data and\
    \ helping the grower\nmake correct decisions. Finally, actuation refers to the\
    \ physical execution of an action commanded by\nthe decision system, and is typically\
    \ carried out by advanced equipment that can receive orders from\na computerized\
    \ control unit. As each action takes place over the crop, the cycle starts and\
    \ closes at\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 207\n5 of 21\ncrop level; the response of the\
    \ crop is then registered by specialized sensors and the loop continues\nsystematically\
    \ until harvesting time, which marks the end of the crop life cycle.\nAgronomy\

    3.1. Stage I: The Crop as the Beginning and End of the Agricultural Management\
    \ Cycle—Analyzing Variability\nRegardless how the crop will be managed, some degree\
    \ of spatial variability is assumed for all\nﬁelds by nature. According to Searcy\
    \ [37], natural variability is inﬂuenced by weather within a growing\nseason and\
    \ from year to year; then, data from several years may be needed to determine\
    \ trends in\nthe parameters of interest, and hence, data becomes a regular input\
    \ to the farm management system.\nTherefore, the necessity of monitoring crops\
    \ comes from the existence of variability, but there is a need\nfor the producer\
    \ to manage that variability in a feasible way, and the widely accepted way to\
    \ do it is by\nsetting within-ﬁeld management zones. Management zones are subﬁeld\
    \ areas that have homogeneous\nfeatures, so ﬁeld practices can be custom-made\
    \ to each of such areas, resulting in a practical and\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 207\n\
    6 of 21\ncost-eﬀective approach to Precision Agriculture [41]. The adoption of\
    \ management zones would reduce\nthe cost of fertilizing, improve crop yields,\
    \ reduce the usage of pesticides, provide better farm records\nthat are essential\
    \ for sale, and provide better information for management decisions [4]. According\n\
    to Zhang et al. [38], the number of management zones is a function of the natural\
    \ variability within\nthe ﬁeld, the size of the ﬁeld and certain management factors.\
    \ If the variability is high, the minimum\nsize of a zone is limited by the possibility\
    \ of each farmer to diﬀerentially manage regions within a\nﬁeld in economic and\
    \ logistics terms. In addition to decide the area of working zones, the selection\
    \ of\nthe speciﬁc parameters to be tracked within those zones must be carefully\
    \ made early in the process.\nRovira-Más and Saiz-Rubio [65] classiﬁed crop biometric\
    \ traits in a tri-level division of crop features\ndepending on the focus of interest\
    \ being at soil level, plant level, or produce level. This division\nallowed the\
    \ superimposition of various layers in a standardized map with the aim of determining\
    \ a\ndata-based wine quality index deﬁned as the Quality Potential Index (QPI)\
    \ for each subﬁeld area in a\nvineyard. Nevertheless, there may be speciﬁc cases\
    \ where the spatial variability of a ﬁeld is so low that\na single mapping event\
    \ can be suﬃcient, as reported by Klassen et al. [42] when characterizing soil\n\
    variability in rice ﬁelds.\n3.2. Stage II: Platforms Supporting Sensors\nSensors\
    \ are the universal devices to monitor crops and to obtain objective information\
    \ from them.\nThey are usually integrated in a platform, which is the general\
    \ term used in Figure 1 to name the\nstructures where sensors are placed and carried.\
    \ These platforms may be attached to oﬀ-road vehicles\nor ﬁxed to the ground within\
    \ ﬁelds such as local weather stations. One of the most urgent challenges to\n\
    cope with in the next few years will be getting a wider range of non-invasive\
    \ sensors able to measure\non-the-go. This approach would be closer to Agriculture\
    \ 5.0, as these sensors could be attached to\nautonomous platforms and robots.\
    \ Nowadays, not all the parameters of interest can be measured\nnon-invasively\
    \ and at a distance from the target; however, some technologies such as multispectral\
    \ or\nhyperspectral imaging are making signiﬁcant improvements.\n3.2.1. Remote\
    \ Sensing Platforms: Satellites\nRemote sensing has played a key role in the progress\
    \ of Smart Farming when ﬁeld data became\ngenerally accessible from artiﬁcial\
    \ satellites. Important satellites providing agricultural information are\nthe\
    \ American Landsat satellites (eight satellites take spectral data from the Earth\
    \ each 16 to 18 days),\nthe European Sentinel 2 satellite system (it provides\
    \ multispectral data at 10 m pixel resolution for\nNDVI—Normalized Diﬀerence Vegetation\
    \ Index—imagery, soil, and water cover every ten days), the\nRapidEye constellation\
    \ (ﬁve satellites provide multispectral RGB imagery, as well as red-edge and NIR\n\
    bands at 5 m resolution), the GeoEye-1 system (captures multispectral RGB data\
    \ and NIR data at a\n1.84 m resolution), and the WorldView-3 (collects multispectral\
    \ data from the RGB bands including\nthe red-edge, two NIR bands, and 8 SWIR bands\
    \ with a resolution of 1.24 m at nadir). IKONOS\nand QuickBird have been already\
    \ decommissioned. There exist several reviews on satellite sensing\napplications,\
    \ having recent studies focused on the potential applications of thermal technologies\
    \ using\nremote sensing [44] and nutritional status in commodity crops [45].\n\
    3.2.2. Aircraft Systems\nThe distance between crops and satellites is considerable,\
    \ typically around 700 km, and deeper\ninsights are reachable when sensors remain\
    \ closer to the targets. For aircraft systems, the distance\nto land can be around\
    \ 100 m. For example, there is a legal limit of 120 m above the ground in Spain\n\
    for unmanned ﬂying vehicles. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and remotely-piloted\
    \ aircrafts (RPA)\ncan basically be of two kinds: Fixed-wing aircrafts and multirotor\
    \ aircrafts. Rotary-wing UAVs are\nmore stable ﬂiers as they are capable of a\
    \ vertical take-oﬀ and landing; however, they are slower and\ncannot cover as\
    \ much area during their battery life. Fixed-wing platforms, on the other hand,\
    \ can cover\nmore area per ﬂight and carry larger payloads, but tend to be more\
    \ expensive and break more easily\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 207\n7 of 21\nafter multiple\
    \ landings [45]. When compared to remote sensing, the advantages of UAVs for Precision\n\
    Agriculture are their ﬂexibility in frequency (revisit time of satellites) and\
    \ better spatial resolutions.\nWhen compared to ground vehicles, UAVs can get\
    \ data from inaccessible places where conventional\nequipment cannot stand; however,\
    \ they require a professional planning of the ﬂight route beforehand,\nand certain\
    \ machine vision applications may require ﬂying at midday to avoid vegetation\
    \ shadows\non the ground causing errors with imagery data. Furthermore, post processing\
    \ the data and image\nmosaicking is often quite challenging. An important disadvantage\
    \ of UAVs is the limited payload\nthey can carry, which often limits the suite\
    \ of sensors onboard, as well as the incapacity of ﬂying with\nstrong wind.\n\
    3.2.3. Proximal Sensing: Ground Autonomous Systems—the Great Push for Agriculture\
    \ 5.0\nWhen monitoring platforms operate from the ground, the distance from the\
    \ sensors to the target\ncrop diminishes to less than 2 m. Due to the proximity\
    \ of the sensor to the plant, when data is acquired\nfrom ground-based platforms,\
    \ it is called proximal sensing. Ground vehicles are polyvalent in relation\n\
    to the payload of sensors. As these vehicles move near the crop, the data acquired\
    \ increase in accuracy,\nand resolutions of one or more samples per meter are\
    \ feasible, being only limited by the speciﬁcations\nof the particular sensors\
    \ implemented. When active sensors are used, weather conditions such as\nstrong\
    \ sunlight or poor illumination are not a serious problem anymore, and, in case\
    \ of on-the-ﬂy\nprocessing, real-time applications are possible, as spraying weeds\
    \ with the previous detection of the\npest [47]. There has been a signiﬁcant impulse\
    \ in the last ﬁve years for the particular case where data is\nretrieved from\
    \ an autonomous platform (unmanned ground vehicle or UGV) [48–52]. Aravind et\
    \ al. [48]\nreviewed ground robots for tilling, soil analysis, seeding, transplanting,\
    \ crop scouting, pest control,\nweed removal and harvesting, where crop scouting\
    \ has been deﬁned as the process of continuously\nmonitoring the ﬁeld to acquire\
    \ information on the plant status, disease incidence, and infestations\naﬀecting\
    \ crop growth. Shamshiri et al. [27] described recent achievements of UGVs for\
    \ weed control,\nﬁeld scouting, and harvesting, highlighting that, if successfully\
    \ integrated and implemented, ﬁeld\nscouting robots can play a key role in reducing\
    \ production cost, increasing productivity and quality,\nand enabling customized\
    \ plant and crop treatments. The European Commission (EC) has recently\nbacked\
    \ the relevance of robotic technology for Smart Farming by funding four projects\
    \ involving the\nconstruction of UGVs for advanced vineyard management: VineRobot,\
    \ Vinbot, GRAPE, and VineScout.\nIn 2016, the European project VineRobot [53]\
    \ delivered a monitoring robot prototype at a Technology\nReadiness Level (TRL)\
    \ status between 6 and 7 (TRL1 represents an early stage concept and TRL9\nis\
    \ a solution ready for production), paving the path for its conceptual termination\
    \ in the VineScout\nproject [54]. The 2019 version of VineScout is shown in Figure\
    \ 2. This robot is autonomously driven\nwhen monitoring vineyards with the assistance\
    \ of local perception sensors (stereo camera, lidar and\nultrasound sensors) for\
    \ navigation and safeguarding. It gathers data from the canopy of the vines with\n\
    the goal of creating plant water status maps and nutritional status maps. In order\
    \ to accomplish its\nmission in a reasonable timeframe, established by end-users\
    \ at a rate of 6 ha per day, this robot monitors\nvine canopies non-invasively,\
    \ which implies several challenges. Regarding hardware, fast and robust\nsensors\
    \ were set to work non-invasively and in motion, while having a cost-eﬃcient price\
    \ for the\nagriculture sector. Regarding software, the challenge was the agile\
    \ integration of all the crop-sensing\ndevices and the multi-season ground-truth\
    \ validation of the models developed in the ﬁeld.\nIn addition to scouting robots,\
    \ the introduction of robotics to the farm is also being led by industry\non speciﬁc\
    \ agricultural tasks. Naïo Technologies, for instance, has developed robot Oz\
    \ for mechanical\nweeding [55], and the autonomous sprayer GUSS received the Davidson\
    \ Prize in 2019 [56]. RowBot\nSystems LLC (Minneapolis, MN, USA) patented a robotic\
    \ platform whose structure was conﬁgured\nto perform several ﬁeld tasks, as selectively\
    \ applying fertilizer, mapping growth zones, or seeding\ncover crop [57]. Over\
    \ the 20th century, farm productivity has been increasing by augmenting the\n\
    size of machines, which has led to heavy and oversized equipment. In order to\
    \ invert this trend,\nresearchers and growers have started to think about alternatives\
    \ to tractors to avoid soil compaction.\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 207\n8 of 21\nShamshiri\
    \ et al. [27] suggested using various machines instead of one heavy machine. In\
    \ the same\nline, Hameed [58] proposed a technology that enabled a single farmer\
    \ to control a team of automated\nvehicles, and Ball et al. [59] used cooperative\
    \ robots as a measure to control weeds. In fact, there\nhave been several projects\
    \ implementing more than one machine operating in collaborative work,\nas the\
    \ Flourish European project that combines UAVs and UGVs to retrieve information\
    \ for decision\nsupport [46], or the RHEA project where a ﬂeet of autonomous robot\
    \ units performed treatments in\ncrops [82].\n \nfunding four projects involving\
    \ the construction of UGVs for advanced vineyard management: \nVineRobot, Vinbot,\
    \ GRAPE, and VineScout. In 2016, the European project VineRobot [53] delivered\
    \ \na monitoring robot prototype at a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) status\
    \ between 6 and 7 (TRL1 \nrepresents an early stage concept and TRL9 is a solution\
    \ ready for production), paving the path for \nits conceptual termination in the\
    \ VineScout project [54]. The 2019 version of VineScout is shown in \nFigure 2.\
    \ This robot is autonomously driven when monitoring vineyards with the assistance\
    \ of local \nperception sensors (stereo camera, lidar and ultrasound sensors)\
    \ for navigation and safeguarding. It \ngathers data from the canopy of the vines\
    \ with the goal of creating plant water status maps and \nnutritional status maps.\
    \ In order to accomplish its mission in a reasonable timeframe, established by\
    \ \nend-users at a rate of 6 ha per day, this robot monitors vine canopies non-invasively,\
    \ which implies \nseveral challenges. Regarding hardware, fast and robust sensors\

    \ price for the agriculture sector. Regarding software, the \nchallenge was the\
    \ agile integration of all the crop-sensing devices and the multi-season ground-truth\
    \ \nvalidation of the models developed in the field. \n \n \n(a) \n(b) \nFigure\

    \ \nFigure 2. Version II (2019) of VineScout autonomous robot: Front (a) and rear\
    \ (b).\n3.3. Stage III: Data\nOne of the fundamental diﬀerences between traditional\
    \ and modern farming is, apart from the\nmechanization level, the data collected\
    \ directly from the crops. In traditional farms where growers\njudge by visual\
    \ assessment, decisions are relative and subjective. Modern farming oﬀers assessment\n\
    by quantitative data producing objective decisions. Sensors allow data acquisition\
    \ in the ﬁeld, but\nthe special case of non-invasive technologies in combination\
    \ with on-the-ﬂy sensing from moving\nplatforms has opened the window of massive\
    \ data collection, a forerunner of big data in agriculture.\nHowever, the excess\
    \ of data is also a serious challenge to cope with, as vital information may result\n\
    masked by noise. The NDVI measurements collected for plotting the maps of Figure\
    \ 3 [94] were\ncollected with two sensors working simultaneously (SRS sensors,\
    \ METER Group, Inc., Pullman, WA,\nUSA) and placed in the robot of Figure 2. One\
    \ of the sensors pointed to the sky and corrected NDVI\nestimates with the incident\
    \ light from the sun, and the other sensor pointed sidewise to the canopy\nto\
    \ collect data from the leaves at an approximate distance of 0.5 m. The zenithal\
    \ photo inserted on\nthe bottom-right corner of Figure 3a shows the VineScout\
    \ autonomous robot taking data between\ntwo rows in a vineyard. The onboard algorithm\
    \ averaged individual local measurements of NDVI in\nsquare cells of 16 m2 classiﬁed\
    \ into nine NDVI levels between 0 and 1 (Figure 3a). The grid map of\nFigure 3a,\
    \ despite informative, is not operational, so a further simpliﬁcation of data\
    \ is necessary before\na grower may ﬁnd it useful. Figure 3b is the result of\
    \ applying a clustering ﬁlter to Figure 3a. It shows\ntwo management zones based\
    \ on vine vigor (high-medium) for the grower to make decisions, together\nwith\
    \ water status maps, about fertilization and diﬀerential harvesting.\nAgronomy\

    3.3.1. Maps Containing Relevant Field Features\nDisplaying data in a coherent\
    \ format is key for ﬁnal users to understand what is happening in the\nﬁeld. The\
    \ most common way to display agricultural data has been in the format of maps,\
    \ as mapping is\nuseful to deﬁne spatial trends and homogeneous zones. However,\
    \ displaying agronomical information\nin beautiful maps should not be the goal\
    \ of map generation. Maps need to be useful for making decisions,\nthey need to\
    \ be a help to answer a question, providing an interpretation of spatial information\
    \ [39].\nThe goal of building maps is obtaining a few management zones with the\
    \ parameters of interest so that a\ntreatment can be eﬃciently applied. To get\
    \ plausible management zones, kriging is one of the most used\ninterpolation techniques\
    \ to delimit areas of manageable sizes [43]. Taking into account the considerable\n\
    amount of data that Smart Farming generates, there are many software applications\
    \ to cope with\ninterpolation, in general, or kriging in particular [66]. Also,\
    \ when building a map, a coordinate system\nneeds to be supplied along with the\
    \ map. One ideal alternative for agricultural maps is brought by\nthe Local Tangent\
    \ Plane (LTP) coordinate system, which features Euclidean geometry, allows user-set\n\
    origins, and employs the intuitive coordinate frame east-north. Regarding the\
    \ coding and display of\ndata in the maps, grids allow the systematic quantization\
    \ of the LTP coordinate system to manage crop\nproduction information more eﬃciently,\
    \ facilitating the exchange of information among successive\nseasons and the comparison\
    \ of multiple parameters on the same ﬁeld [67]. A practical example of\ngrid-based\
    \ maps using LTP coordinates is shown in Figure 3.\nTaking into account the key\
    \ role of positioning systems, a map-based approach is the method\nin which a\
    \ Global Positioning System (GPS)—or any other Global Navigation Satellite System\n\
    (GNSS)—receiver and a data logger (e.g., an onboard computer) are used to record\
    \ the position of a\nparticular measurement (georeferenced data), so several maps\
    \ can be generated and processed along\nwith other layers of spatially variable\
    \ information [68]. In general, GNSS receivers are the universal\nposition devices\
    \ used to build maps; however, in some cases, for example in greenhouses or dense\n\
    ﬁelds of tall trees, GNSS is not the best option to use due to the diﬃculty of\
    \ getting signals with reliable\naccuracy; so, in some cases, alternative solutions\
    \ such as machine vision must be implemented [69].\n3.3.2. Data Management Software\
    \ to Ease the Process of Decision Making\nA popular way to manage ﬁeld data displayed\
    \ on maps and culminate with a practical solution\nis through the use of Geographic\
    \ Information Systems (GIS). This set of computer-based tools (or\ndata platforms)\
    \ allows to store, analyze, manipulate and map any type of georeferenced information.\n\
    A speciﬁc GIS system called the Field-level geographic Information System (FIS)\
    \ was developed\nfor Precision Agriculture applications [70], but it was set for\
    \ old computer operative systems\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 207\n10 of 21\nsuch as Windows\
    \ 3.1×, 95, 98, or NT [71]. The updated version of FIS is the farm management\n\
    information system (FMIS), which according to Burlacu et al. [72] is a management\
    \ information system\ndesigned to assist farmers with various tasks, ranging from\
    \ operational planning, implementation and\ndocumentation to the assessment of\
    \ performed ﬁeld work. The purpose of FMIS is to reduce production\ncosts, comply\
    \ with agricultural standards, and maintain high product quality and safety, guiding\n\
    growers to make the best decisions possible [95]. Farm management software solutions\
    \ support the\nautomation of data acquisition and processing, monitoring, planning,\
    \ decision making, documenting,\nand managing the farm operations [64], and include\
    \ basic functions for record keeping like crop\nproduction rates (harvests and\
    \ yields), proﬁts and losses, farm tasks scheduling, weather prediction,\nsoil\
    \ nutrients tracking, and ﬁeld mapping, up to more complex functionalities for\
    \ automating ﬁeld\nmanagement accounting for farms and agribusinesses (accounting,\
    \ inventory management, or labor\ncontracts). In many cases, growers do not need\
    \ to be ﬂuid on data management because the software can\nbuild maps or decision-making\
    \ models with basic information introduced by growers. Furthermore,\na critical\
    \ feature of these applications is that they even help in the early warning of\
    \ weather-related\nhazards that enables farmers, policy makers, and aid agencies\
    \ to mitigate their exposure to risk [83].\nHowever, it must be taken into consideration\
    \ that the eﬃciency of a recommendation for a particular\nagent will depend on\
    \ the factors included in the algorithms of the software (technical, economic,\n\
    safety-wise. . . ). In this sense, a DSSAT (Decision Support System for Agrotechnology\
    \ Transfer)\nprovides outputs with experimental data for evaluation of crop models,\
    \ allowing users to compare\nsimulated outcomes with observed results, which is\
    \ critical if real-world decisions or recommendations\nare based on modeled results\
    \ [84]. Table 2 gathers a representative set of commercially available FMIS\n\
    programs speciﬁcally conﬁgured to deal with the usual data generated in the farm.\
    \ It includes the\nname of each application program, the company commercializing\
    \ it with its headquarters location,\nand the main features of the program. The\
    \ table is focused on programs managing crop data as the\nprimary tool, and its\
    \ purpose is not the compilation of all available FMIS software, which would\n\
    be futile given the rate new applications are constantly released, but bringing\
    \ a proof of the global\neﬀort realized in the last decade to deploy Smart Farming\
    \ in actual farms, accelerating the move\nfrom academics to agribusiness. The\
    \ examples show that some smartphone and tablet applications\nalready include\
    \ complex features so that growers can insert data directly in the ﬁeld; other\
    \ companies,\non the contrary, prefer having a basic application for mobile devices\
    \ to increase complexity in the\ncloud-based desktop version. In the majority\
    \ of cases, it is not necessary to have wireless connection\nwhile the grower\
    \ is entering data in the ﬁeld, because as soon as the mobile device ﬁnds a wireless\n\
    connection to the internet, it synchronizes the data previously introduced by\
    \ the grower in the mobile\ndevice with the data safely stored in the cloud. Many\
    \ of the programs listed below oﬀer the option\nof upgrading the software depending\
    \ on speciﬁc grower needs, increasing the price accordingly.\nThe most advanced\
    \ tools include features for ﬁnancial and machinery management, help in the\n\
    decision-making process, release warnings, or even propose management advice.\
    \ In many cases, these\nsoftware applications are not only addressed to the grower\
    \ or producer, but also to other stakeholders in\nagriculture such as inputs suppliers,\
    \ service suppliers, and food distributors, which makes a diﬀerence\nfor Smart\

    \ T: Technology); 2 PaaS: Platform as a service.\nThe use of commercial data management\
    \ systems, as the ones listed in Table 2, often implies\nthat producers need to\
    \ share their crop data with a software platform owned and run by private\ncompanies.\
    \ This fact creates some controversy regarding the ownership of the data. In the\
    \ Software\nServices Agreement (SSA), it is stated that the person or entity providing\
    \ the data to the farm\nmanagement software company shall own and retain all rights,\
    \ title and interest in and to their\ndata, so that the data belongs to the provider\
    \ [76]. However, when data are aggregated with other\ngrowers’ data, the combined\
    \ data typically become property of the software company [96]. The list of\napplications\
    \ included in Table 2 proves that there is a global interest in developing software\
    \ for farm\ndata management, and most of the features requested by end-users are\
    \ similar everywhere. This table\nalso gives an idea of the interest raised in\
    \ industry by software-based management systems. However,\nmany applications use\
    \ their own proprietary formats, which complicates the share of data among data\n\
    acquisition and processing systems. A standardization eﬀort is needed among software\
    \ developers\nand providers. The ADAPT toolkit of Table 2 [77] is an example of\
    \ how to face this challenge, as it\nprovides an open-source application that\
    \ eliminates a barrier to the broad use of Precision Agriculture\ndata by enabling\
    \ interoperability between diﬀerent hardware and software applications.\n3.4.\
    \ Stage IV: Decision-Making\nIn situations where many ﬁeld parameters need being\
    \ considered, people ﬁnd practical diﬃculties\nin managing complex information\
    \ to make eﬀective decisions. In such cases, artiﬁcial intelligence\n(AI) can\
    \ help with techniques like deep learning or neural networks, fuzzy logic, genetic\
    \ algorithms,\nor expert systems. AI, with its modelling and reasoning capabilities,\
    \ can play a key role in agriculture,\nhelping to make sense of all the data available.\
    \ Fuzzy logic, to name one example within AI, resembles\nhuman reasoning imitating\
    \ the way of making decisions that involve several possibilities instead of\n\
    ‘true’ or ‘false’ alternatives; this technique uses linguistic variables that\
    \ ﬁt well with the complexity\nof the challenges posed by the diversity of agricultural\
    \ decision making. According to Dengel [20],\nagriculture oﬀers a vast application\
    \ area for all kinds of AI core technologies as agents operating in\nuncontrolled\
    \ environments. Giusti and Marsili-Libellia [81] designed a fuzzy-based decision\
    \ support\nsystem (DSS) taking as input variables soil moisture and rain forecast\
    \ for kiwi, corn, and potato.\nSimilarly, the DSS developed by Navarro-Hellín\
    \ et al. [87] estimated weekly irrigation for citrus\norchards taking into account\
    \ climate and soil variables; in that work, real-time measurements from soil\n\
    Agronomy 2020, 10, 207\n14 of 21\nparameters in a closed-loop control scheme were\
    \ decisive to avoid the accumulative eﬀect due to errors\nin consecutive weekly\
    \ estimations, as the DSS was allowed to adapt to local perturbations. In the\n\
    same fashion, Lindsay Corporation (Omaha, Nebraska, USA) was awarded for its solution\
    \ FieldNET\nAdvisor™ [91] that provides irrigation management decisions for growers.\
    \ DSS may be more robust\nand reliable when diﬀerent variables are considered,\
    \ but some procedures remain controversial as\nobjectives can lead to diﬀerent\
    \ solutions at diﬀerent times based on the priority set by decision makers\nor\
    \ other people involved in the procedure [88].\nSrivastava and Singh [80] highlighted\
    \ the importance of incorporating the graphical part of GIS to\nDSS, which was\
    \ demonstrated for water management scenarios in India. The importance of using\n\
    GIS for agricultural DSS lies on using user-friendly graphical interfaces for\
    \ growers. The result of a\nquestionnaire distributed by VineScout project [36]\
    \ members to the attendees of a ﬁeld demonstration in\nPortugal (October 2019),\
    \ evidenced the high value given to graphical user interfaces (GUI). Considering\n\
    that the prototype is in research phase and not commercial yet, 84% of the attendees\
    \ concluded that\nthe robot GUI shown in Figure 4 was simple to understand and\
    \ easy to use (unpublished research).\nRupnik et al. [89] developed a cloud-based\
    \ system to allow growers upload their own data, utilize\nseveral data analysis\
    \ methods, and ﬁnally present their outputs as decisions to apply. This time,\
    \ their\nuse case focused on spray planning for ﬁghting against pests in vineyards\
    \ and orchards. Rose et al. [90]\nconducted a survey on DSS and arrived to the\
    \ conclusion that 15 factors were inﬂuential in convincing\nUK growers and advisers\
    \ to use DSS, including usability, cost-eﬀectiveness, performance, relevance to\n\
    user, and compatibility with compliance demands. In addition, they found that\
    \ 49% of UK farmers used\nsome kind of DSS, and the preferred ways of delivery\
    \ were software (28%), paper-based (22%) tools,\nand mobile apps (10%). These\
    \ results show that the use of software to manage decisions is growing,\nbut its\
    \ percentage is still low and comparable to those who preferred paper-based tools.\
    \ Choosing\nsoftware and mobile applications to make agricultural decisions may\
    \ be considered beneﬁcial because\ndigital tools increase management eﬃciency\
    \ when compared to paper-based tools; however, there is\nstill a long way to make\
    \ technology-based tools attractive enough—easy to understand, intuitive and\n\
    nice—for growers to adopt. On the producer side, it is important to have access\
    \ to proper training\nuntil these technologies can be comfortably managed.\nAgronomy\

    \ 1 is the\nphysical actuation on the crop. Actuation is understood as executing\
    \ some action on the crop or\nrelated to it, and this can be done by making decisions\
    \ right after obtaining information (real-time\napplications) or in another moment\
    \ deferred in time (oﬀ-line). For farmers to execute decisions,\nthey need advanced\
    \ equipment that can receive orders from a computerized control unit. Variable\n\
    rate machines can execute a number of farming tasks driven by a smart system [60].\
    \ Variable rate\ntechnology (VRT) applied on site-speciﬁc crop management (SSCM)\
    \ has the potential to increase\nproﬁt and decrease environmental impact [61]\
    \ as only what is needed is actually applied. Colaço\nand Molin [92] conducted\
    \ a long-term study for six years with the goal of evaluating the eﬀects of\n\
    variable rate fertilization on fertilizer consumption, soil fertility, and yield\
    \ in citrus. The outcomes\nof comparing variable and uniform rates showed that\
    \ the former achieved higher yields while using\nless fertilizer: using nitrogen,\
    \ fruit yield (kg of oranges) respect to the amount of fertilizer resulted\nin\
    \ a 32% yield increase in ﬁeld 1, and 38% in ﬁeld 2. When using potassium, the\
    \ yield increase even\nreached 40% in ﬁeld 1. In the case of phosphorus, the growth\
    \ rate was approximately 20% for both\nﬁelds. A recent review led by Nawar et\
    \ al. [93] conﬁrmed that, when management zone delineation\ntechniques were used\
    \ for variable-rate nutrient application, farm eﬃciency increased in all cases\n\
    when compared to traditional uniform-rate applications, and environmental impacts\
    \ were reduced.\nMachinery manufacturers are leading the development of commercial\
    \ solutions implementing VRT.\nThomasson et al. [62] described commercial VRT\
    \ systems oﬀered by major agricultural machinery\nmanufacturers, like CLAAS, that\
    \ used the ISARIA crop sensor for the variable-rate application of\nnitrogen-based\
    \ fertilizer, or the CEBIS MOBILE ISOBUS, which, apart from having other Precision\n\
    Agriculture functions, it is a compatible terminal to integrate the ISARIA sensor.\
    \ Another promising\ntype of variable actuation is automatic diﬀerential harvesting\
    \ or variable rate harvesting (VRH),\nwhich attempts harvesting according to previously\
    \ deﬁned management zones. In specialty crops,\nSethuramasamyraja [40] worked\
    \ in diﬀerential harvesting for vineyards by using near-infrared sensors\nto determine\
    \ grape quality in the ﬁeld based on the anthocyanin content of berries. The three\
    \ steps for\nthis VRH system involved sensing the anthocyanin content of grapes,\
    \ using these data to produce\nquality map based on a threshold anthocyanin level,\
    \ and feeding the quality map to the harvester for its\ncommanding. CLAAS was\
    \ awarded for implementing VRH in combines and forage harvesters [91] by\nmerging\
    \ precision sensing technology with autonomous machine control. The goal was to\
    \ maximize\nproductivity and automatically optimize harvester performance, according\
    \ to the changing conditions\nof the soil, plants, grain, and humidity in the\
    \ harvested ﬁeld. A USDA statistical analysis conducted in\n2010 [3] showed that\
    \ variable rate technologies had positive, but small, rate adoptions of 1% due\
    \ to\ntheir diﬃculty of use. Apart from eﬃciency and utility, cost is also a critical\
    \ parameter to consider for\nthe adoption of this technology. In this sense, the\
    \ ubiquitous availability of low-cost electronics will\nfavor the introduction\
    \ of such digital applications. In fact, advances in autonomous driving technology\n\
    for cars, including object detection capabilities through multi-camera systems,\
    \ have already reduced\nthe cost of developing automated agricultural machines\
    \ [22].\n4. Discussion\nAfter the Industrial Revolution, mainly since the advent\
    \ of mechanization, and along the Green\nRevolution, humans and machines have\
    \ been eﬃciently collaborating for growing crops to feed people.\nHowever, to\
    \ face the population growth in the coming years, an extra eﬀort is needed to\
    \ succeed,\nnot only in feeding people by increasing productivity, but also in\
    \ doing it in the most eﬃcient and\nrespectful possible way, that is, producing\
    \ sustainably. To face this challenge, remarkable advances in\ntechnology have\
    \ been appearing over the last decades, in particular the access to reliable agricultural\n\
    data and advanced computer techniques to get the optimal meaning from them, eventually\
    \ obtaining\nmaximum beneﬁts while being respectful with the environment. This\
    \ new approach driven by digital\ntechnology implies that growers must act as\
    \ supervisors of their crops rather than laborers, in an attempt\nAgronomy 2020,\
    \ 10, 207\n16 of 21\nof avoiding repetitive, physically-demanding, and tedious\
    \ ﬁeld tasks. In this modern agronomical\nframework, DATA is the key, and the\
    \ information-based management cycle described above provides\nthe practical approach\
    \ that unites concept and tasks. The following points summarize some of the\n\
    speciﬁc ideas drawn from this study:\n•\nPrecision Agriculture, which consists\
    \ of applying what is needed when and where is needed,\nhas further improved the\
    \ eﬃciency of managing farms with the addition of data-based digital\nsystems\
    \ that increase the knowledge of producers about their ﬁelds; this is known as\
    \ Agriculture\n4.0 or Digital Farming. When these data-driven farms incorporate\
    \ robotics with AI algorithms to\ntheir systems, the overall concept is then referred\
    \ to as Agriculture 5.0. Some studies report that\nagricultural robots integrating\
    \ forms of AI can do certain tasks faster than humans [23]. Despite\nthere are\
    \ other studies that contradict this statement [63], robotics is a growing economy\
    \ and there\nexists a great potential for many applications within agriculture.\n\
    •\nA greater adoption of Digital Farming by professional growers is vital to not\
    \ only improving a\nfarm’s ﬁnancial performance, but also to meet the food needs\
    \ of an expanding population [6].\nSmall farms will steadily incorporate basic\
    \ technology whereas large ﬁelds will likely invest with\nsophisticated equipment,\
    \ but data-less intuition-driven management will no longer represent\nthe modus\
    \ operandi of professional farms in the future. This should be considered a source\
    \ of\nopportunities, especially for a new generation of young farmers used to\
    \ digital technology, who\nare the ones with the capacity to balance an aging\
    \ population in rural areas, mainly those in\nindustrialized countries.\n•\nAfter\
    \ the rapid growth of UAVs, a steady-state is being reached, mostly induced by\
    \ the fact that\ndata analysis and ground-truth validation has resulted far more\
    \ complex and delicate than image\nacquisition and platform handling. This has\
    \ promoted the expansion of proximal sensing and the\nexploration of combining\
    \ both data sources—aerial and terrestrial—for a better understanding of\nthe\
    \ physiology of plants and trees.\n•\nMaps, as the most common way to represent\
    \ agricultural data, would need to be standardized.\nIntensely-interpolated colored\
    \ maps are output by GIS, FMIS, and other software applications,\nbut at the time\
    \ of comparing data with the precision enough to grant statistical signiﬁcance,\
    \ it often\nbecomes an impossible mission without standardization. Figure 3, for\
    \ example, uses the ﬂat\nrepresentation provided by the local tangent plane (LTP)\
    \ and formatted in a regular grid. Other\nprograms use UTM projections, and there\
    \ are even images only given in geodetic coordinates.\nAt the need of overlapping\
    \ maps, it takes a big eﬀort to make all data compatible. Not only the\nway coordinates\
    \ are represented needs a standard, but also the units, intervals, and even colors\
    \ in\nwhich parameters are displayed. The combination of aerial and ground data,\
    \ for instance, will\ngreatly beneﬁt from such standardization in the way data\
    \ is visually displayed for the average\ngrower to understand.\n•\nTable 2 provides\
    \ a representative compilation of software applications for farm management.\n\
    The list is not exhaustive, and yet includes companies from four continents and\
    \ 14 countries,\nwhich provides evidence of the fact that agricultural digitalization\
    \ is in fact a global move.\n•\nRegarding variable rate applications, adoption\
    \ rates need to augment, and to do so, farmers must\nﬁnd by themselves the value\
    \ in this technology for their crops. Only after maintaining accurate\nspatial\
    \ records and analyzing ﬁeld data can eﬀective variable rate prescriptions be\
    \ created [39] to\naddress particular tasks.\n5. Conclusions\nThis analysis conﬁrms\
    \ that consistent knowledge about farms leads to optimal decisions.\nAgricultural\
    \ management systems can handle farm data in such a way that results are orchestrated\n\
    to address customized solutions for each farm. This aid for farmers in the form\
    \ of digital solutions\ncombines forces with robotics and artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ to launch the imminent idea of Agriculture\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 207\n17 of 21\n\
    5.0. After thirty years of great expectations—and disappointments—by the application\
    \ of robotics to\nagriculture, the timing seems right for the ﬁrst time. However,\
    \ in order to take the most advantages\nfrom Agriculture 5.0, deep training needs\
    \ to be delivered to users, ideally young farmers eager to\nlearn and apply modern\
    \ technologies to agriculture and granting a generational renewal still to come.\n\
    It seems to be the right time to move forward towards a modern and sustainable\
    \ agriculture that\nis capable of showing the full power of data-driven management\
    \ to face the challenges posed to\nfood production in the 21st Century. The evolution\
    \ to Agriculture 5.0 is in the agenda of most major\nfarm equipment makers for\
    \ the next decade, and therefore oﬀ-road equipment manufacturers will\nplay a\
    \ key role in this move if agricultural robots are considered as the next—smarter—generation\
    \ of\nfarm machines.\nAuthor Contributions: V.S.-R. and F.R.-M. contributed to\

    • 20 enablers of blockchain adoption in the supply chain are identified. • An
    integrated approach based on the diffusion of innovation and business technology
    adoption model is used. • The prominence and interrelationships between different
    blockchain adoption enablers are established. • Insights on enhancing blockchain
    adoption in the supply chain are given. Abstract Blockchain technology has been
    growing in importance and acceptability over the past few years. Yet, there is
    limited empirical research on the organizational and technology specific factors
    that play a critical role in driving its adoption in the supply chain. The purpose
    of this paper is to develop a comprehensive framework for blockchain adoption
    in the supply chain by identifying the enablers and empirically evaluating their
    interdependencies and impact on adoption. 20 enablers of blockchain adoption in
    the supply chain are identified using an extensive literature review and theoretical
    lenses from the Diffusion of Innovation (DOI) theory and the business technology
    adoption model developed by Iacovou, Benbassat and Dexter (1995). In the confirmatory
    phase, we employ the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL)
    method to extract logic from data collected from 37 French experts about the impact
    of the enablers and their interdependencies. Our paper extends the multi-theoretic
    empirical studies to blockchain technology and identifies the enablers of blockchain
    adoption from technological, organizational, supply chain and external environment
    perspectives. Regarding the importance of the categories of enablers, we find
    that the relative advantage of the technology and the external pressure are the
    most prominent categories of enablers that impact blockchain adoption in the supply
    chain. Our analysis also shows the important causal role on adoption of the potential
    of blockchain to reduce transaction cost, the consumer interest in traceability
    data and the establishment of a regulatory framework for blockchain usage. Previous

    chain managementDEMATEL 1. Introduction Blockchain technology has recently gained
    importance as a promising technology in the area of supply chain management. For
    instance, Maersk used an IBM blockchain solution to efficiently track its containers
    around the world (Popper and Lohr, 2017). Catina Volpone vineyard (www.cantinavolpone.it)
    in Puglia, Italy and Ernst and Young''s EZ Lab (www.ezlab.it) developed a blockchain-based
    solution that enables full transparency through the wine supply chain and allows
    customers to access information about the harvesting, pressing, and bottling dates
    and conditions, among many other details for each bottle or case of wine (Montecchi
    et al., 2019). Similarly, Walmart and IBM have successfully implemented a blockchain-based
    solution for tracking pork products in China with a farm-to-table approach, providing
    transparency and full information about the supply chain stages every individual
    product went through (Yiannas, 2017). Blockchain solutions providers such as Everledger
    (everledger.io), Provenance (provenance.org), Bext360 (bext360.com) conducted
    pilot projects and offered typical use cases that demonstrate blockchain potential
    in verifying and certifying the origin, authenticity and integrity of products
    such as diamond, wine buttles, luxury fashion, coffee beans, and medicines (Kshetri,
    2018; Montecchi et al., 2019; Lacity, 2018; Tönnissen and Teuteberg, 2020). Enabling
    traceability, enhancing transparency and establishing product provenance as shown
    in the above examples are not the only benefits of using blockchain technology.
    Indeed, blockchain is a distributed ledger (database) through which supply chain
    partners can interact and create, verify, validate, and securely store various
    kinds of records such as product information, certificates, localization data,
    transaction records, data acquired from sensors and other connected devices (Crosby
    et al., 2016; Iansiti and Lakhani, 2017). Thus, in addition to providing traceability
    and making the whole history of products digitally available, blockchain promises
    to improve supply chain coordination and process efficiency (Kshetri, 2018; Babich
    and Hilary, 2020; Queiroz et al., 2020; Wamba et al., 2020) and to achieve supply
    chain sustainability goals (Casey and Wong, 2017; Kouhizadeh and Sarkis, 2018;
    Kshetri, 2018; Babich and Hilary, 2020). Despite the promises and the enormous
    potential of blockchain technology, its adoption in supply chains is still underexplored.
    Few studies address this question, offering a fragmented view of adoption''s enablers.
    Our objective in this research is to further investigate blockchain adoption in
    supply chains, develop a comprehensive framework for adoption enablers, measure
    their level of influence and understand their mutual relationships. Our work answers
    the following questions: RQ1: What are the enablers of blockchain technology adoption
    in the supply chain? RQ2: What are the levels of influence of the identified enablers
    on the adoption decision? RQ3: How do the enablers interact and influence each
    other? We base our study on an integrative theoretical approach that combines
    the Diffusion of Innovation (DoI) theory (Rogers, 2010) and the business technology
    adoption model developed in Iacovou, Benbasat and Dexter (1995). The choice of
    these theoretical lenses allows us to extend the technology adoption framework
    to include factors related to the technology itself, the organization at both
    the firm and the supply chain levels, and the environment. As for the empirical
    investigation, we use the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL)
    methodology (Gabus and Fontela, 1972) to analyze data collected from experts in
    supply chain or IT management working in France. DEMATEL is very appropriate for
    our purpose because it is designed for modeling relationships and interdependencies
    between a large number of factors and evaluating their impact. Our paper provides
    both theoretical and practical contributions that improve our understanding of
    the enablers of blockchain adoption in supply chains and offer guidance to managers
    and policymakers on how they can best direct their efforts to enhance adoption.
    From the theory perspective, our work is the first effort to provide an extensive
    list of enabling factors of blockchain adoption in supply chains, evaluate their
    effects and map their interdependencies. It also adds contribution to the very
    limited body of research that uses a multi-theoretic framework to establish the
    theoretical context of blockchain technology adoption for the supply chain management.
    Our study also contributes to the practice by providing an evaluation of the importance
    of the enablers of blockchain adoption in the supply chain and by analyzing their
    interdependencies. Managers and policymakers may use the results and insights
    from this study to inform their decisions and action plans for blockchain adoption
    in their supply chains. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows.
    In Section 2, we provide an overview of the literature on blockchain technology
    applications in supply chain management and its adoption. In Section 3, we develop
    a theoretical framework for considering blockchain adoption in supply chains and
    identify the enablers of adoption from the literature. Research methodology and
    data collection are presented in Section 4. The results obtained are presented
    and discussed in Section 5. Then, Section 6 presents implications and managerial
    insights from our study, and Section 7 conclude the paper. 2. Background 2.1.
    Blockchain technology Blockchain technology can be defined as a peer-to-peer network
    technology that is used to build and maintain distributed ledgers or databases
    of records (Crosby et al., 2016; Iansiti and Lakhani, 2017). Parties participating
    in a blockchain (firms, institutions, individuals, etc.) can interact with each
    other and create all kinds of records (product information, certificates, localization
    data, transaction records, data acquired from sensors, etc.). Before being stored
    on the blockchain, records are verified and validated using specific consensus
    mechanisms (Crosby et al., 2016). Then, records are combined to form a block of
    data that is linked with previous blocks to form a chain of blocks or a “blockchain”.
    Data in a blockchain is ordered chronologically, every block of the chain contains
    a hash of the previous blocks, and the whole database is replicated and stored
    on different nodes of the system (Crosby et al., 2016). There exist public (permissionless)
    and private (permissioned) blockchains (Casey and Wong, 2017). A public blockchain
    is generally open and allows everyone to have access to the data. A typical example
    of an open blockchain is the one used to develop Bitcoin. On the opposite, a private
    blockchain is restrained to a given number of predefined participants who may
    have different levels of permission to record and access data. Both public and
    private blockchains are characterized by the implementation of consensus mechanisms
    to validate data, the use of cryptographic links between the blocks of the chain
    and the creation of replicates of the whole database in multiple nodes of the
    network (Crosby et al., 2016; Casey and Wong, 2017). These characteristics offer
    the guarantee that data recorded on a blockchain is valid, immune against any
    alteration and protected against the failure of some of the nodes of the system
    (Crosby et al., 2016; Casey and Wong, 2017; Babich and Hilary, 2020). Though blockchain
    technology was first created and implemented to support cryptocurrency transactions
    (Nakamoto, 2008), it found application in various domains and business sectors
    (Carson et al., 2018; Lacity, 2018). Across sectors, multiple use cases demonstrate
    the high potential of blockchain technology in achieving operations and supply
    chain management goals (Hackius and Petersen, 2017; Kshetri, 2018; Queiroz et
    al., 2020). 2.2. Use of blockchain technology in supply chain management A supply
    chain is typically composed of independent organizations which are directly involved
    in the upstream and downstream flows of products, services, finances, and/or information
    from a source to a customer (Mentzer et al., 2001). Effective management of a
    supply chain requires members to cooperate and mutually share information (Gunasekaran
    et al., 2001; Tan et al., 2002; Carr and Kaynak, 2007; Fawcett et al., 2011).
    In this regard, blockchain technology promises to drastically improve supply chain
    management and achieve supply chain performance objectives by providing a platform
    for direct interaction between supply chain members to exchange credible and tamper-proof
    data (Casey and Wong, 2017; Kshetri, 2018; Babich and Hilary, 2020; Queiroz et
    al., 2020; Wamba et al., 2020). One of the main benefits of this technology is
    that it enables full product traceability and enhances visibility through the
    different supply chain stages (Casey and Wong, 2017; Babich and Hilary, 2020).
    For instance, using smart tagging and blockchain technology, the UK-based blockchain
    solutions provider Provenance was able to successfully track fish caught by fishermen
    in Indonesia, and provide robust proof of compliance to standards from the origin
    and along the chain to consumers (https://www.provenance.org). Another example
    of blockchain-enabled product tracking is the pilot project conducted by Walmart
    in collaboration with IBM to digitally track pork products in China from the farm
    to the customer table. The technology enabled timely digital access to full individual
    pork product data, including the farm it comes from, factory it went through,
    the batch number, the storage temperature and shipping details (Yiannas, 2017).
    In addition to product tracking, blockchain offers powerful solutions for acquiring
    and aggregating detailed product information that may be used to authenticate
    products and certify their origin, as well as to assure product quality and integrity
    (Montecchi et al., 2019). For instance, the startup Everledger (https://www.everledger.io)
    has developed blockchain-based solutions to create and maintain unique identifying
    data for individual units of products in various sectors. The solutions are used
    for tracking and authenticating wine bottles (Kshetri, 2018), as well as for providing
    quality assurance and helping jewelers comply with regulations in diamond industry
    (Casey and Wong, 2017). Blockchain may also be used by Supply chain members to
    share demand, inventory, and capacity-related data. This data may then be selectively
    aggregated through the different tiers of the supply chain and used to improve
    supply chain coordination and operational efficiency (Babich and Hilary, 2020).
    A higher degree of coordination and operational efficiency may also be obtained
    through the implementation of blockchain enabled smart contracts to automate transactions
    among supply chain members (Babich and Hilary, 2020; Wang et al., 2019). Blockchain
    technology is instrumental in achieving supply chain sustainability goals (Kouhizadeh
    and Sarkis, 2018; Kshetri, 2018; Babich and Hilary, 2020). Indeed, product provenance
    knowledge helps in fighting against product counterfeiting (Alzahrani, N., and
    Bulusu, N., 2018; Montecchi et al., 2019), while product tracking capabilities
    help in better planning and implementing reverse logistics operations, such as
    product takeback, product reuse, remanufacturing, and recycling (Kouhizadeh and
    Sarkis, 2018; Babich and Hilary, 2020). The technology may also be used by supply
    chain members to share sustainability-related data from the different processing
    and transportation stages the product went through. Then, by aggregating this
    data, the overall product carbon footprint can be efficiently evaluated, as it
    has been demonstrated by Shakhbulatov et al. (2019) for transportation operations
    in the food industry. Blockchain technology may also be used by Supply chain members
    to upload certificates of compliance with different sustainability standards,
    which may then be compiled to ascertain claims of product and supply chain sustainability
    (Kouhizadeh and Sarkis, 2018; Babich and Hilary, 2020). Furthermore, using blockchain
    technology is believed to improve supply chain risk management (Kouhizadeh and
    Sarkis, 2018; Kshetri, 2018; Babich and Hilary, 2020) and supply chain resilience
    (Dubey et al., 2020) in addition to lowering transaction costs between the supply
    chain members (Kshetri, 2018; Schmidt and Wagner, 2019; Wamba et al., 2020). 2.3.
    Adoption of blockchain technology in the supply chain The innovative nature of
    blockchain technology and its potential for improving supply chain management
    has woken the interest in investigating the challenges and enablers of its adoption
    in supply chain context. In a pioneering work, Casey and Wong (2017) discussed
    the obstacles related to blockchain technology adoption in global supply chains
    and highlighted the challenges related to the interoperability between different
    blockchains and the complexity of the rules and regulations that govern contracting
    and commercial exchange, especially across national borders. Thus, to further
    encourage blockchain adoption in global supply chains, the authors advocate agreeing
    on standards and rules for interoperability between blockchains, as well as adapting
    current regulations and industry practices to the new dematerialized, automated
    and global nature of blockchains (Casey and Wong, 2017). Drawing on in-depth interviews
    with supply chain experts, Wang et al. (2019) reported on the perceived challenging
    nature of the complexity of the technology and its high cost of implementation.
    They also highlighted the need for establishing clear governance rules for blockchains
    and providing interoperability between two or more different blockchains and between
    blockchains and other existing systems, in addition to resolving the problematic
    question of data ownership. Leveraging lessons from RFID implementation research
    by using a multi-approach methodology based on focus group, survey and cases,
    van Hoek (2019) highlighted the importance of multiple internal and external drivers
    in addition to management commitment for blockchain implementation. In a study
    involving four supply chains in the dairy food sector, Behnke and Janssen (2020)
    identified 18 boundary conditions for using blockchain solutions to provide product
    traceability. These conditions were then aggregated in 5 categories which are:
    firm''s internal business processes and information system-related conditions
    such as the technical capacity and ability of different supply chain members to
    maintain traceability; supply chain process conditions that involve the interface
    and consistency between internal and external supply chain-related processes;
    traceability conditions that comprise consensus between supply chain members on
    the type, level of details and granularity of traceability data; quality-related
    conditions that involve consistency between supply chain members with regards
    to quality data; and regulatory conditions in relation with compliance to different
    product, country or customer-specific regulations. Using an integrative framework
    composed of institutional, market and technical factors Janssen et al. (2020)
    suggest that blockchain adoption may be negatively impacted by the resistance
    of organizations to change, the lack of understanding of the technology, the need
    for new regulations, the need for appropriate governance framework of blockchain,
    the cost of adoption and implementation of blockchain, the need for standardizing
    the information exchange processes, among other factors. Focusing on blockchain
    technology used for managing supply chain sustainability, Saberi et al. (2019)
    identified four groups of barriers that may hinder the adoption of this technology:
    intra-organizational barriers, inter-organizational barriers, system-related barriers,
    and external barriers. Building on Saberi et al. (2019) and using the Technology,
    Organization, and Environment (TOE) framework, Kouhizadeh et al. (2021) analyze
    the relations between the four groups of barriers and their impact on the adoption
    of blockchain solutions for managing sustainability in supply chains. Their results
    demonstrate that the lack of management commitment and support, lack of knowledge
    and expertise, lack of cooperation, coordination and information disclosure between
    supply chain members, lack of policies and industry involvement are prominent
    barriers to blockchain adoption for the sustainable supply chain management. The
    above works are mostly oriented towards identifying impediments and challenges
    of blockchain technology implementation in supply chains. Adopting a different
    perspective, Kamble et al. (2020) examined the enabling factors of blockchain
    adoption for traceability in agriculture supply chain and highlighted the positive
    influence of the blockchain-enabled reduction of transaction cost, information
    sharing and data security. In a study of the organizational enablers of blockchain
    adoption in supply chains, Clohessy and Acton (2019) found that top management
    support and organizational readiness are significant determinants of blockchain
    adoption, and large companies are more likely to adopt blockchain than small to
    medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Using the TOE framework and survey results, Wong
    et al. (2020) find that blockchain complexity, cost and relative advantage have
    significant effects on the intention to adopt blockchain technology for supply
    chain management in Malaysian SMEs. Considering blockchain adoption by individual
    users in supply chain context, Kamble et al. (2019) find that perceived usefulness
    is a determinant factor of technology adoption by practitioners. Queiroz and Wamba
    (2019) also build and test a model for blockchain adoption by supply chain practitioners
    and demonstrate that higher performance expectancy (i.e., improvement in job activities
    that blockchain can bring for the SCM professionals) encourages adoption. In our
    study, we adopt a comprehensive approach and use elements from all the above studies
    to build an extended list of blockchain adoption enablers in the supply chain.
    We then evaluate the levels of influence of these enablers and their interactions
    using DEMATEL methodology. Kamble et al. (2020) and Kouhizadeh et al. (2021) are
    the closest research papers to our work as they also use DEMATEL. However, multiple
    differences between this literature and our study do exist and allow us to add
    new results and insights to the extant literature. A fundamental difference that
    distinguishes our study from Kamble et al. (2020) is that our approach is not
    restrained to any particular sector while Kamble et al. (2020) is focused on blockchain
    adoption in agriculture supply chain. As for Kouhizadeh et al. (2021), our study
    is different from this paper from various perspectives, including the theoretical
    background, the scope, the methodology, the survey sample and the analysis. The
    theoretical background used in Kouhizadeh et al. (2021) is composed of force field
    theory and TOE framework, while we use the DOI theory combined with the Business
    Technology Adoption model developed in Iacovou et al. (1995). With regards to
    the scope, Kouhizadeh et al. (2021) studies the barriers to blockchain adoption
    and use the broader scope of sustainable supply chain management that encompasses
    economic, social and environmental aspects of supply chain management while we
    analyze enablers of adoption using the traditional approach to supply chain management
    which focuses mainly on the economic aspect of management. Though there exist
    some overlapping between the scopes of the two studies leading to similarities
    between some of the factors investigated, the lists of factors used in the two
    studies present much more differences than similarities. Differences are mainly
    due to the fact that we consider enablers and have a deep focus on the economic
    pillar of supply chain management while Kouhizadeh et al. (2021) consider barriers
    and widen the scope to integrate social and environmental pillars. From a methodology
    perspective, Kouhizadeh et al. (2021) proceed hierarchically by investigating
    the influences between categories of barriers and then between the barriers within
    each category. Contrasting with this hierarchical approach, we acquire the respondents’
    evaluations of direct mutual influences between all the enablers taken together.
    While each method has its advantages and limits, ours allows for capturing and
    analyzing the direct mutual influences among all the enablers. Lastly, our analysis
    is focused on getting insights from practitioners in different industries and
    sectors, while a major part of the work in Kouhizadeh et al. (2021) is dedicated
    to comparing results from academics with those obtained from practitioners. Given
    these differences with existing literature, our study adds new results and insights.
    3. Theoretical framework and enabling factors of blockchain technology adoption
    in the supply chain In this section, we present the theoretical framework for
    blockchain adoption in the supply chain. Then we use this framework to identify
    the adoption enablers based on an extensive review of the literature. 3.1. Theoretical
    framework The theoretical approach used in this study is based on two complementary
    theories on innovation and technology adoption. The first theory is the diffusion
    of innovation (DOI) (Rogers, 2010). DOI posits that adoption of any new technological
    innovation is largely determined by five attributes that are: the complexity of
    the innovation, its compatibility with the organization, the benefit or advantage
    that it offers compared to other existing technological choices, its observability
    and trialability. Two of these factors i.e., trialability and observability have
    often been dropped from IT innovation literature (Chong et al., 2009). This is
    because, by nature of organizational adoption of technology, these become top-down
    activity where the organization imposes the new IT innovation with limited trialability
    for its constituents. For the same reasons, observability of new IT innovation
    within the organization is also limited and hence the factor is not included in
    DOI-based models when analyzing IT innovations (Chong et al., 2009; Oliveira et
    al., 2014). While DOI focuses on the innovation''s characteristics responsible
    for adoption and diffusion of new technologies, it is widely recognized that IT
    adoption at the firm level is subject to organizational and external context-related
    factors(Oliveira and Martins, 2011). Hence, it is imperative to study organizational
    and context-related factors in any firm level technology adoption. Given these
    concerns with taking a single theoretic approach to study technology adoption
    and the limitations of DOI, researchers have argued for and utilized multi-theoretical
    approaches (Hong et al., 2021; Wamba et al., 2020). A theoretical framework like
    DOI needs to be supplemented with a more organization and external context specific
    framework to embrace the complete array of factors impacting the adoption. Iacovou,
    Benbassat and Dexter (1995) provide an appropriate lens to fulfill this purpose.
    Indeed, the framework in Iacovou et al. (1995) was developed to provide a deeper
    understanding of the way organizational, external and technology specific factors
    impact the adoption of technology by firms. It includes organizational factors
    related to the technological and financial readiness of the adopting organization
    along with external factors related to the organization''s environment, such as
    partners, regulations and competition. As such the model provides a perfect complementary
    view to the DOI framework to study various factors that have a role to play in
    technology adoption by organizations. Based on the above discussion, we argue
    that five groups of enablers that include three innovation characteristics (relative
    advantage, compatibility and complexity) in addition to organizational and external
    context-related factors shape the situation where a firm must make the decision
    to adopt blockchain technology in the supply chain, as shown in Fig. 1. In the
    following sub-sections, these five categories of enablers are further explained
    and the enablers that compose each one of them are identified based on an extensive
    review of the literature. Download : Download high-res image (187KB) Download

    3.1.1. Organizational readiness Organizational readiness refers to the organization''s
    financial and technological capacities that affect the implementation and use
    of the technology (Iacovou et al., 1995). Implementing blockchain technology requires
    investing in various kinds of software and hardware and using sophisticated information
    systems for collecting, storing and communicating data (Iansiti and Lakhani, 2017).
    Therefore, in our model of blockchain adoption in the supply chain, this dimension
    comprises factors that reflect the technological capabilities of the firm (Behnke
    and Janssen, 2020; Bumblauskas et al. 2019; Janssen et al., 2020); the knowledge
    and expertise in using the technology (Behnke and Janssen, 2020; Mendling et al.,
    2018; Wang et al., 2019; Janssen et al., 2020) and the availability of the financial
    resources required for implementing the technology (Wang et al., 2019; Janssen
    et al., 2020). Extant literature identifies top management commitment as being
    influential on the adoption of inter-organizational information systems (Gunasekaran
    and Ngai, 2008). Indeed, management commitment allows for devoting the necessary
    human and financial resources for implementing the technology and the organizational
    change (Saberi et al., 2019; Kouhizadeh et al., 2021; van Hoek, 2019). Thus, we
    posit management commitment as an enabler of blockchain adoption and map it to
    the organizational readiness dimension. 3.1.2. Relative advantage The relative
    advantage of an innovation can be defined by the increase in the economic benefit
    and the impact that the innovation brings compared to existing systems that it
    replaces (Rogers, 2010). Relative advantage is often found to be positively correlated
    with the adoption of innovations (Kapoor et al., 2014). It is also found to be
    an antecedent of technology adoption in the supply chain context (Brandon-Jones
    and Kauppi, 2018). Literature reports that, compared to other existing systems,
    blockchain technology better ensures data integrity (Casey and Wong, 2017; Babich
    and Hilary, 2020; Kouhizadeh and Sarkis, 2018; Montecchi et al., 2019), improve
    data availability from multiple sources and supply chain members (Casey and Wong,
    2017; Babich and Hilary, 2020; Kouhizadeh and Sarkis, 2018; van Hoek, 2019). In
    addition, it is widely admitted that using this technology reduces the cost of
    transactions between supply chain members (Kshetri, 2018; Schmidt and Wagner,
    2019; Tönnissen and Teuteberg, 2020; Wamba et al., 2020). Note that the transaction
    cost considered here is different from the concept of overall cost of ownership
    of blockchain. Indeed, while studies like Kshetri (2018), Schmidt and Wagner (2019),
    Tönnissen and Teuteberg (2020) and Wamba et al. (2020) point out the contribution
    of blockchain to lowering transaction cost, other works like Wang et al. (2019)
    and Janssen et al. (2020) insist on the challenging nature of blockchain implementation
    cost. To our knowledge, a thorough study of the overall cost-related impact of
    blockchain adoption (cost of implementation, the resulting reduction in transaction
    costs and the return on investment) doesn''t exist yet. This represents a critical
    gap in literature, where the cost-related implications of blockchain adoption
    in a supply chain need to be studied. In our study, we focus on the enablers of
    adoption. We thus include the capacity of blockchain to lower transaction cost
    in our list of enablers. We map the three enablers discussed above to the relative
    advantage dimension in our theoretical framework. 3.1.3. Compatibility The compatibility
    refers to the degree of consistency between the innovation and existing values,
    experience and needs of the organization (Rogers, 2010). Blockchain technology
    is typically used in supply chain management to create and share unique data records
    among trade partners to increase transparency and visibility of information through
    the whole supply chain (Casey and Wong, 2017; Babich and Hilary, 2020; Montecchi
    et al., 2019). Its implementation may require changing internal operational processes
    to maintain internal traceability and support the required level of details in
    data (Mendling et al., 2018; Tönnissen and Teuteberg, 2020). It also requires
    the willingness and capacity of supply chain members to share data and to cooperate
    for establishing common process standards, rules for information disclosure and
    related supply chain objectives. Therefore, we map to the compatibility dimension
    the enablers related to these aspects, which are: ease in implementing process
    and organizational changes to accommodate blockchain adoption and use (Mendling
    et al., 2018; Chang et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019; Janssen et al., 2020); availability
    of credible and accurate data from the internal processes (Behnke and Janssen,
    2020; Wang et al., 2019); cultural aspects related to the propensity for transparency
    among the supply chain members (Wang et al., 2019; Janssen et al., 2020; Kouhizadeh
    et al., 2021); cooperation between supply chain members to agree on common rules
    for data disclosure and confidentiality issues (Wang et al., 2019; Behnke and
    Janssen, 2020; Kouhizadeh et al., 2021); cooperation for process standardization
    and agreement between supply chain members on the type and level of details of
    the data to be shared on the blockchain (Casey and Wong, 2017; Bumblauskas et
    al. 2019; Wang et al., 2019; Behnke and Janssen, 2020; Janssen et al., 2020);
    cooperation between the supply chain members to adopt common objectives from using
    the technology (Babich and Hilary, 2020; Wang et al., 2019; Kouhizadeh et al.,
    2021). 3.1.4. Complexity Complexity indicates to which degree the innovation is
    perceived as being difficult to understand and use (Rogers, 2010). Blockchain
    is a disruptive and relatively complex technology (Crosby et al., 2016; Iansiti
    and Lakhani, 2017), and this may hurts its adoption. Thus, we map to this dimension
    factors in the literature that help in alleviating the effect of the complexity
    of the technology and act as enablers for its adoption and use for supply chain
    management. These factors are: developing and harmonizing blockchain technology
    standards (Lacity, 2018; Wang et al., 2019; Janssen et al., 2020); establishing
    appropriate and clear governance rules for blockchain platforms (Mendling et al.,
    2018; Wang et al., 2019; Janssen et al., 2020); establishing rules and standards
    for interoperability between blockchains and between blockchains and other systems
    (Mendling et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2019). 3.1.5. External pressure External
    pressure to adopt the innovation refers to the influences originating from the
    organization''s environment (Iacovou et al., 1995). Indeed, the influence exerted
    by external parties may be determinant in the adoption of inter-organizational
    information technologies (Teo et al., 2003). In our theoretical model for blockchain
    adoption within the context of supply chain management, this dimension comprises
    pressures that originate from the organization''s environment as well as encouraging
    factors in this environment. Building on this and on findings in the extant literature,
    we map the following enablers to the external pressure category: customer interest
    in the traceability information and other product-related data on the blockchain
    (Lacity, 2018; Kshetri, 2018; Montecchi et al., 2019; van Hoek, 2019); industry-wide
    initiatives to promote blockchain technology adoption and use (Casey and Wong,
    2017; Lacity, 2018; Behnke and Janssen, 2020); establishing regulatory framework
    for using blockchain technology (Casey and Wong, 2017; Lacity, 2018; Wang et al.,
    2019; Janssen et al., 2020); and government pressure for implementing blockchain
    technology (Lacity, 2018). 3.2. Enablers of blockchain adoption in the supply
    chain Table 1 summarizes the results of the literature review we conducted to
    identify the enablers of blockchain adoption in the supply chain. Information
    in Table 1 provides the answer to our research question RQ1 and informs our model
    for blockchain adoption in the supply chain by providing a list of enablers of
    adoption organized in five catagories as per the model in Fig. 1. Table 1. Enablers
    of blockchain technology adoption in the supply chain. Category Enabler Enabler
    Name Enabler Description References Organizational Readiness E1 Technological
    capabilities To implement and use blockchain technology a firm needs to use sophisticated
    information systems for collecting, storing and communicating data. Availability
    of such systems and capabilities encourages adoption. Iansiti and Lakhani (2017);
    Behnke and Janssen (2020); Bumblauskas et al. 2019; Janssen et al. (2020) E2 Knowledge
    and expertise in using the technology Implementing blockchain technology requires
    specific and new technical expertise. The availability of such expertise in the
    firm would thus encourage the implementation of the blockchain technology. Behnke
    and Janssen (2020); Mendling et al. (2018) E3 Availability of financial resources
    Blockchain adoption and implementation requires investing in sophisticated technology
    and the availability of sufficient financial resources encourages such investment.
    Wang et al. (2019); Janssen et al. (2020) E4 Management commitment Management
    commitment allows for devoting the necessary resources for implementing blockchain
    technology. Firm''s management also plays an important role in encouraging and
    accompanying the cultural and organizational changes that the implementation of
    the technology may require. Gunasekaran and Ngai (2008); Kouhizadeh et al., 2021;
    van Hoek, 2019 Relative Advantage E5 Integrity of data on the blockchain Blockchains
    are designed to guarantee that it is much difficult to erase or change already
    stored data. This may encourage adoption, as data is more secure and trustful.
    Casey and Wong (2017); Babich and Hilary (2020); Kouhizadeh and Sarkis (2018);
    Montecchi et al. (2019) E6 Improved data availability from multiple sources and
    supply chain members One of the main characteristics of blockchain technology
    is that it makes all the recorded data virtually continuously available for all
    the network participants. Casey and Wong (2017); Babich and Hilary (2020); van
    Hoek, 2019 E7 Lower transaction cost Blockchain allows for reducing the cost of
    transactions between supply chain members, especially due to disintermediation
    and the application of smart contracts. Kshetri (2018); Schmidt and Wagner, 2019;
    Tönnissen and Teuteberg (2020); Wamba et al. (2020) Compatibility E8 Ease in implementing
    process and organizational changes to accommodate blockchain adoption and use
    Implementing blockchain technology requires re-engineering of related processes
    to support availability of required data. Therefore, the ease in implementing
    organizational changes encourages the adoption of the technology. Mendling et
    al. (2018); Chang et al. (2019); Wang et al. (2019); Janssen et al. (2020) E9
    Availability of credible and accurate data from internal processes Using blockchain
    for sharing information among supply chain members requires accurate and credible
    data to be collected from their internal processes. Thus, the availability of
    such data enables the supply chain members to share it and may encourage the adoption
    of blockchain technology for this purpose. Mendling et al. (2018); Wang et al.
    (2019); Behnke and Janssen (2020); Janssen et al. (2020) E10 Cultural aspects
    related to the propensity for transparency among the supply chain members Using
    blockchain technology is usually intended to increase supply chain transparency.
    Thus, a culture of transparency among supply chain members encourages the adoption
    of this technology. Wang et al. (2019); Janssen et al. (2020); Kouhizadeh et al.,
    2021 E11 Cooperation between supply chain members to agree on common rules for
    data disclosure and confidentiality issues A data disclosure policy that identifies
    the data that will be shared between the supply chain members and the rules for
    accessing the data on the blockchain is a first step towards data disclosure and
    for making it available on the blockchain. Wang et al. (2019); Behnke and Janssen
    (2020); Kouhizadeh et al., 2021 E12 Cooperation between supply chain members for
    process standardization and agreement on the type and level of details of the
    data to be shared on the blockchain To share data on blockchain, supply chain
    members need to agree on standard processes, thee types, formats, and level of
    details of the data to be shared. Casey and Wong (2017); Bumblauskas et al. 2019;
    Wang et al. (2019); Behnke and Janssen (2020); Janssen et al., 2020 E13 Cooperation
    between supply chain members to adopt common supply chain objectives from using
    the technology Agreeing on common objectives from using blockchain technology
    among the supply chain members increases the chance of adoption and use of this
    technology by them. Babich and Hilary (2020); Wang et al. (2019); Kouhizadeh et
    al., 2021 Complexity E14 Developing and harmonizing blockchain technology standards
    Blockchain protocols are not stable yet. There is also a lack of standardization
    of the technology and the format of data and interfaces with other systems. Advances
    in this regard would encourage adoption. Lacity (2018); Wang et al., 2019; Janssen
    et al. (2020) E15 Establishing appropriate and clear governance rules for blockchain
    platforms To be trusted and to work efficiently, a blockchain should have an appropriate
    governance structure and clear rules for decision-making, and conflict resolution.
    Babich and Hilary (2020); Wang et al. (2019); Janssen et al. (2020) E16 Establishing
    rules and standards for interoperability between blockchains and between blockchains
    and other systems A company may be part of multiple blockchains. Thus, there is
    a need to know how these blockchains may interact with each other. Mendling et
    al. (2018); Wang et al., 2019 External Pressure E17 Customer interest in the traceability
    information and other product-related data on blockchain Interest of customers
    in traceability information and other data available on the blockchain would push
    firms and supply chains to adopt this technology for supply chain management to
    ensure data availability for customers. Lacity (2018); Kshetri (2018); Montecchi
    et al., 2019; van Hoek, 2019 E18 Industry wide initiatives to promote blockchain
    technology adoption and use Adoption of blockchain technology may be encouraged
    by initiatives to promote adoption that are taken on the level of the entire industry.
    Casey and Wong (2017); Lacity (2018); Behnke and Janssen (2020) E19 Establishing
    regulatory framework for using blockchain technology Establishing new regulations
    that are adapted to blockchain-enabled transactions may encourage adoption, as
    the current regulatory framework doesn''t not cover the transactions and the new
    business models made possible by blockchain technology. Casey and Wong (2017);
    Mendling et al. (2018); Lacity (2018); Wang et al. (2019); Janssen et al. (2020)
    E20 government pressure for implementing blockchain technology Government could
    adopt regulations to mandate the implementation and use of blockchain technology,
    for traceability and authentication purposes in some sectors, such as in pharmaceutical
    production. Lacity (2018) 4. Research method To evaluate the levels of influence
    of the enablers identified in Section 3 and analyze their relationships, we use
    the DEMATEL method. DEMATEL is a decision-making support tool that helps in acquiring
    the input of experts regarding complex problems, and appropriately using this
    information to improve our understanding of such problems. This tool is particularly
    adapted for studying problems in which multiple intricate factors mutually influence
    each other and contribute together to forming an overall situation (Gabus and
    Fontela, 1973). It helps in evaluating the relative importance or impact of the
    factors under consideration and establishing causal relationships between them.
    DEMATEL has been widely used for studying a variety of supply chain management-related
    topics, such as analyzing and modeling sustainability practices in supply chains
    (Gandhi et al., 2015; Govindan et al., 2011; Kaur et al.2017; Lin, 2013); modeling
    supplier selection criteria (Chang et al., 2011); analyzing enablers of supply
    chain risk mitigation (Rajesh and Ravi, 2015); and analyzing traceability implementation
    (Haleem et al., 2019). 4.1. Steps for applying DEMATEL As previously mentioned,
    DEMATEL is based on experts’ input regarding the interaction between factors related
    to a given problem (Li and Mathiyazhagan, 2018; Bai et al., 2017). Once the factors
    to be studied are identified, DEMATEL is implemented as follows. Step 1: Acquiring
    the evaluation of the factors from a panel of experts. The first step in implementing
    DEMATEL is to collect data from experts on how they think the different factors
    impact each other. For this purpose, experts are asked to make pairwise evaluations
    of the impact of factors on each other. Let be the number of factors under consideration,
    a matrix of size is formed with all these factors in the lines and in the columns.
    The experts are then asked to fill in the cells of this matrix with their evaluation
    of the influence of each factor in the lines on the different factors in the columns.
    Let be the number of experts participating to the study. Each expert (with ) will
    return a matrix that contains his evaluation ( ) regarding the influence of each
    factor ) in the lines on each factor ( ) in the columns. Note that the size of
    the matrix is , as the same factors are reported in the lines and in the columns
    of the matrix. As for the evaluations , they take numerical values that represent
    the expert''s evaluation of the influence between factors. The values on the diagonal
    of any matrix are, of course, set to zero (i. e., ) as a factor could not influence
    itself. Step 2: Computing the direct relation matrix (B). Using the output from
    Step 1, one single direct relation matrix is computed by aggregating the matrices
    using the formula in Equation (1). (1) Step 3: Computing the normalized direct
    relation matrix. In this step, the direct relation matrix is normalized as follows.
    The sum of elements in each line of the matrix is computed and the maximum sum
    ( ) is selected as in Equation (2). (2) Then, the normalized direct relation matrix
    is computed as in Equation (3). (3) Step 4: Computing the total relation matrix
    (T). The total relation matrix ( ) is computed using the normalized direct relation
    matrix as in Equation (4). (4) Step 5: Computing the total influence between factors.
    The total influence a factor (i) exerts on the other factors is computed by taking
    the sum of the elements in the corresponding row ( ) in the total relation matrix
    (T), as in Equation (5). As for the influence that a factor (j) receives from
    the other factors in the system, it is equal to the sum of the elements in the
    corresponding column ( ) in the same matrix (T). Equations (5), (6)), show how
    these two elements are computed. (5) (6) Step 6: Computing the prominence ( )
    and the net effect ( ) of the factors. Then, for each factor ( ) the overall importance
    (prominence) ( ) and the net effect ( ) are computed using the expressions in
    (7), (8). (7) (8) The prominence ( ) of a factor ( ) represents the sum of the
    influence that this factor exerts on and receives from the other factors in the
    system. The net effect ( ) of a factor ( ) represents the difference between the
    influence that this factor exerts on the other factors and the influence of the
    other factors of the system on it. At this stage, all the information regarding
    the influence of the factors is obtained and can be illustrated using diagrams
    and graphics. But a further step that allows for focusing on the significant relationships
    between the factors could be performed by discarding all the values in the matrix
    (T) that are lower than a threshold ( ). Notice that choosing a small value of
    the threshold leads to discarding very few relationships and results in complex
    diagrams between factors due to the high number of direct relations considered.
    On the other hand, a high value of the threshold ( ) could lead to discarding
    too many relations that could be interesting to consider. Given the high number
    of factors we deal with in this study, we choose to use a threshold value that
    exceeds the average of the elements in the total relation matrix (T) by one standard
    deviation. Thus, ( ) is calculated using the expression (9). (9) 4.2. Sampling
    respondents and collecting data We targeted a sample of 160 potential respondents
    who have sufficient expertise in supply chain management or information technology
    applications in supply chains. Following similar studies which are based on experts''
    opinion such as Agi and Nishant (2017), Bokrantz et al. (2017) and Wang et al.
    (2019), we used two main criteria to select potential respondents: (1) the number
    of years of experience within the field and (2) the position in the company. Thus,
    all the members of our targeted sample have at least 5 years of work experience
    in functions related to supply chain management or information technology management
    with direct linkages to supply chain processes. All the experts in our panel work
    in middle or higher management positions in their respective companies, or as
    confirmed or senior consultants. We built the targeted sample using our network
    and asked for help from the Brittany Chamber of Commerce (CCI-Bretagne), France
    to identify potential respondents. Given the emerging nature of blockchain technology
    applications in supply chain management, the respondents didn''t need to be experts
    in blockchain technology. However, in the e-mail we sent to them to ask if they
    are willing to take part to the study, they were informed that they should be
    aware of blockchain technology attributes and its current and potential use in
    supply chain management in order to fill in the questionnaire. Finally, as our
    study is not restricted to a specific sector, targeted respondents came from companies
    operating in a variety of sectors including manufacturing, distribution, service,
    and consulting. We followed a two-step process in collecting answers from respondents,
    as explained in Appendix I. In a first step, we sent e-mails to all the 160 potential
    respondents to give them a full explanation of the objective of the study and
    ask if they are willing to contribute by filling the matrix of mutual influence
    between the 20 factors. Then, an Excel file representing the evaluation matrix
    with the 20 enablers in the rows and the columns, and the evaluation grid (Table
    2) were sent to the 52 respondents who declared their willingness to take part
    to the study. Data collection took place from mid-January to mid-March 2021. In
    a limited number of cases, we had to call the respondents and give explanations
    on the way they should proceed for filling in the Excel sheet. The use of the
    Excel sheet in collecting answers helped to limit the typing errors, as the data
    was ready to be exploited directly in Excel. Out of the 52 respondents who initially
    accepted to fill in the matrix, 37 returned useable responses in which answers
    to all the questions are obtained and the Excel file is entirely completed. Table

    3, we notice that out of the 37 respondents, 16 work in supply chain management
    related functions, 9 in IT management with supply chain applications, 7 are CEOs
    and 5 are consultants. It is also to be noted that most of the respondents (23
    out of 37) have more than 10 years of work experience in the field of the study.

    for two reasons. First, the respondents are individuals with significant information
    about the phenomenon under investigation in addition to being experts in the field
    (Bai et al., 2017; Li and Mathiyazhagan, 2018). Hence, even a low number of respondents
    could provide detailed insights into the phenomenon being studied. Secondly, the
    method relies on the respondents’ critical evaluation of theoretically chosen
    factors to help the researchers establish the relative importance and mutual dependence
    of these factors. As such a small sample size is expected to help the research
    reach a level of theoretical saturation (Kamble et al., 2020; Li et al., 2018).
    It needs to be established that the generalizations that are drawn from the result
    trace themselves as much to the theory being established as to the empirical data.
    Hence, we are claiming theoretical generalization as against statistical generalization
    of the results (Jha et al., 2016). Theoretically generalized results are considered
    to be robust due to their grounding in critically evaluated theoretical paradigms
    and utilized widely in circumstances where limited access to data prohibits statistical
    generalization (Maxwell and Chmiel, 2014). 5. Analysis and results Our analysis
    started by applying Equation (1) to compute the direct relationship matrix based
    on the 37 useable responses returned by the experts. Then, we computed the normalized
    direct relation matrix (B) using Equations (2), (3)). The total relation matrix
    (T) is then computed using Equation (4). This matrix is presented in Appendix
    II. The total influence an enabler ( ) exerts on and receives from the other enablers
    in the system, respectively ( ) and ( ), are computed using Equations (5), (6).
    Then, the levels of importance (prominence) (R + C) and the net effect (R–C) of
    the enablers are computed by applying Equations (7), (8). Results obtained from
    this step are shown in Table 4. Based on information in Table 4, we order the
    20 enablers according to their prominence scores and graphically depict these
    scores in Fig. 2. Table 4. Prominence and net effect of the enablers. Category

    image Fig. 2. Prominence levels of the enablers. Note that the prominence of an
    enabler indicates its overall importance in the system (Bai et al., 2017; Govindan
    et al., 2015). Thus, information in Table 4 and Fig. 2 answers the second research
    question in this study (RQ2) by providing an evaluation of the level of importance
    of the various enablers with regards to the adoption decision. From Table 4 and
    Fig. 2, we notice that lowering transaction cost (E7) is the most prominent enabler,
    followed by customer interest in the traceability information and other product-related
    data on blockchain (E17), management commitment (E4), establishing regulatory
    framework for using blockchain technology (E19) and cooperation between supply
    chain members for process standardization and agreement on the type and level
    of details of the data to be shared on the blockchain (E12), respectively. On
    the other hand, enablers that have the lowest prominence scores are the availability
    of financial resources (E3), Ease in implementing process and organizational changes
    (E8), the government pressure (E20), the Technological capabilities (E1) and the
    knowledge and expertise in using the technology (E2). While the prominence score
    indicates the overall importance of an enabler, the net effect informs us if this
    enabler should be categorized as a cause or as an effect enabler. Cause enablers
    have positive net effect scores, which indicate that they exert more impact on
    the other enablers in the system than they are impacted by them. Therefore, these
    enablers may be addressed relatively independently of the situation of the other
    enablers, and potentially benefit the whole system. By contrast, effect enablers
    are those enablers with negative net effect scores, indicating that they are more
    impacted by the other enablers of the system than they exert impact on them. Fig.
    3 position the 20 enablers of blockchain adoption under investigation relative
    to the two dimensions: prominence and net effect. The vertical axis in Fig. 3
    represents the prominence. It is graduated from 0.6 to 3.0 to accommodate the
    values that we had in our analysis. The horizontal axis represents the net effect,
    and it ranges from −1.4 to +1.4 with negative and positive values indicating effect
    and cause enablers, respectively. Download : Download high-res image (244KB) Download

    4 and Fig. 3, we notice that half of the 20 enablers of blockchain adoption considered
    in our study are cause enablers and half of them are effect enablers. We also
    notice that among the five most prominent enablers, customer interest in the traceability
    information and other product-related data on blockchain (E17) and establishing
    regulatory framework for using blockchain technology (E19) are cause enablers,
    while lower transaction cost (E7), management commitment (E4), and cooperation
    between supply chain members for process standardization and agreement on the
    type and level of details of the data to be shared on the blockchain (E12) are
    effect ones. 6. Discussion and implications In this section, we further analyze
    and discuss the results obtained in the previous section (Section 5). We do this
    first by considering the prominence of the enablers by category of enablers as
    per the theoretical model presented in Section 3. Then, we focus on the most eminent
    enablers and analyze their relationships and interactions with the rest of the
    system. Subsequently, we use the result of our analysis to elaborate implications
    and managerial insights. 6.1. Prominence by category of enablers Taking a categorical
    construct level view of the enablers, Table 5 shows the average prominence scores
    computed for each category of enablers that compose the theoretical model described
    in Section 3. Categories in this table are ordered according to the average prominence
    of the enablers that compose them. Table 5. Prominence and net effect of the categories
    of enablers. Category Average Prominence Relative Advantage 2.231 External Pressure
    2.080 Compatibility 2.018 Complexity 1.853 Organizational Readiness 1.481 From
    Table 5, we notice that relative advantage and external pressure have the highest
    average prominence values, respectively, while organizational readiness has the
    lowest average prominence value. Thus, blockchain adoption in the supply chain
    is mainly influenced by the benefits (relative advantage) that this technology
    offers in comparison with other existing technologies (integrity of data, improved
    data availability and lower transaction costs), followed by the external pressure
    for adoption exerted by customers and public authorities, in particular. To the
    opposite, organizational readiness seems to have a limited impact on the adoption
    decision. This last result suggests that adoption decision may be taken regardless
    of the organizational readiness, so that blockchain would often be the driver
    of wider organizational transformation. This result finds support in the extant
    literature of digital transformation that states that organizational digitalization
    would be a result of major technological adoption (Andriole et al., 2017; Hartley
    and Sawaya, 2019). 6.2. Prominence and relationships between enablers Lower transaction
    cost (E7), customer interest in the traceability information and other product-related
    data on blockchain (E17), management commitment (E4), establishing regulatory
    framework for using blockchain technology (E19) and cooperation between supply
    chain members for process standardization and agreement on the type and level
    of details of the data to be shared on the blockchain (E12) are top five prominent
    enablers of blockchain adoption in the supply chain, as evidenced in Table 4.
    A careful look in the total relation matrix (T) enables a full understanding of
    the impact of these enablers by uncovering their interactions with the rest of
    the system. However, due to the big number of enablers investigated in this study,
    we analyze relationships and interactions among them and answer the third research
    question of the study (RQ3) by focusing on the meaningful relationships in the
    total relation matrix (T). To do this, we apply a threshold so that only the values
    in the total relation matrix (T) that are higher than the threshold would be considered.
    Applying a threshold and focusing on the most significant relationships among
    factors is a common practice in DEMATEL studies (Kouhizadeh et al., 2021; Fu et
    al., 2012). Table 6 shows the remaining values from the total relation matrix
    (T) after applying the threshold defined in Equation (9). Table 6. The most significant
    relation coefficients between enablers. Empty Cell Impacted enablers E4 E6 E7

    Data in Table 6 shows that the capacity of blockchain to lower transaction cost
    that represent the most eminent enabler (E7) is significantly impacted by a number
    of enablers including the existence of a regulatory framework (E19), standards
    for interoperability (E16) and appropriate and clear governance rules for blockchain
    (E15), in addition to the integrity of data on the blockchain (E5). This suggests
    that supply chain professionals believe that grasping the benefit of lower transaction
    const due to blockchain adoption in the supply chain is subject to the establishment
    of appropriate conditions for using the technology: an appropriate regulatory
    framework, operability standards and governance rules. In its turn, E7 seems to
    significantly enhance the management commitment (F4) and promote the availability
    of credible and accurate data from internal processes (E9). As for the second
    most prominent enabler: customer interest in the traceability information and
    other product-related data on blockchain (E17), data in Table 6 shows that this
    enabler exerts a significant impact on management commitment (E4), data availability
    from internal firm''s processes (E9) as well as from all the participants in the
    blockchain (E6). It also appears that E17 triggers four cooperation-related enablers
    at the supply chain level. These are cooperation between supply chain members
    to agree on: common rules for data disclosure and confidentiality issues (E11),
    process standardization and the type and level of details of the data to be shared
    on the blockchain (E12), common supply chain objectives from using the technology
    (E13) in addition to establishing appropriate and clear governance rules for blockchain
    platforms (E15). The high-level impact of E17 on multiple other enablers as demonstrated
    above suggests that a big portion of the motivation for adopting blockchain technology
    in the supply chain is related to customers'' requirements regarding traceability
    and other product-related data. Management commitment (E4) is identified as the
    third most prominent enabler for blockchain adoption in the supply chain. In-depth
    examination of the role of this enabler using information in Table 6 shows that
    management commitment acts as a bearing point in the system. It appears as an
    effect enabler leveraged, mainly, by the integrity of data on blockchain (E5),
    the potential for lowering transaction cost (E7), The cultural propensity for
    transparency (E10), the existence of rules for interoperability (E16), the customer
    interest in the information on blockchain (E17), and the existence of a regulatory
    framework for using blockchain technology (F19). On its turn, management commitment
    significantly contributes to enhancing the availability of credible and accurate
    data from internal processes (E9) and the cooperation between supply chain members
    to agree on common rules for data disclosure and confidentiality issues (E11),
    process standardization, type and level of details of the data to be shared on
    the blockchain (E12), and common supply chain objectives from using the technology
    (E13). Our results also show that establishing regulatory framework for using
    blockchain technology (E19) is an important cause enabler ranked fourth in prominence.
    It significantly enhances management commitment (E4), the availability of data
    from firm''s internal processes (E9) and from various other sources and supply
    chain members (E6), in addition to supporting reduction of transaction costs (E7).
    E19 also provides a favorable legal environment for cooperation between supply
    chain members to agree on common objectives, rules and standards related to sharing
    data on blockchain, as demonstrated by the significant effect of this enabler
    on E11, E12, E13 and E15. Like management commitment at the firm''s level, cooperation
    at the supply chain level seems to be very important for blockchain adoption.
    This is highlighted by the ranking of the cooperation between supply chain members
    for process standardization and agreement on the type and level of details of
    the data to be shared on the blockchain (E12), ranked fifth in prominence. Data
    in Table 6 shows that this enabler is significantly impacted by customer interest
    in product traceability (E17), the cultural propensity for transparency in the
    supply chain (E10), the establishment of regulatory framework for using blockchain
    technology (E19), the existence of rules for interoperability (E16) and the integrity
    of data on blockchain (E5). Data in Table 6 also shows that the two other enablers
    related to the cooperation between supply chain members (E11) and (E13) are also
    significantly impacted by the same enablers as (E12). Thus, our findings suggest
    that having supply chain members cooperating for adopting blockchain in the supply
    chain is subject to the customer interest in product traceability, the cultural
    propensity for transparency in the supply chain, the existence of regulatory framework
    for using blockchain technology and the existence of rules for interoperability.
    6.3. Implications and managerial insights Our results demonstrate that firm''s
    management commitment and cooperation between supply chain partners on various
    aspects related to data sharing, confidentiality and system governance are both
    of primary importance for adopting blockchain technology in the supply chain.
    Findings also reveal that management commitment and cooperation between supply
    chain members for blockchain adoption are mainly triggered and supported by factors
    that may be addressed by extending efforts in three main directions. First, for
    raising awareness among consumers and firms'' managers about the usefulness of
    the availability of product data and the capability of blockchain to provide such
    data availability. Second, for developing and harmonizing the technology standards,
    in addition to enhancing blockchain interoperability. Third, for preparing a regulatory
    environment that favors the adoption and use of the technology. Consumers are
    a primary source of pressure on firms. Our findings show that consumer interest
    in product-related data, including traceability, encourages firms’ managers to
    adopt the blockchain technology and enhances collaboration among supply chain
    partners for data sharing on blockchain. This enabler may be addressed by conducting
    awareness campaigns to sensitize consumers on the usefulness of data that may
    be provided using blockchain. Such awareness campaigns may be conducted by consumers
    associations, NGOs or industry representative bodies. It may concern a wide range
    of data related to products as well as production and supply chain processes.
    For instance, consumers'' awareness about sustainability aspects in production
    motivates them to put more pressure for getting detailed and accurate information
    from all supply chain members regarding the social and environmental practices.
    Similarly, campaigns against fraud and counterfeit products in fashion and luxury
    industries encourage consumers to be more demanding for extensive and tamper-proof
    product information. In addition to consumers, awareness campaigns may also target
    firms upper and middle management to demonstrate the various advantages of blockchain
    in comparison with other technologies, especially its potential to lower the cost
    of transactions, which appears to be an impactful enabler of blockchain adoption
    in the supply chain. Actions of industry representative bodies, consulting firms
    and technology solutions promotors are crucial in this regard. Concretely, they
    may organize seminars, meetings, and workshops where new blockchain-enabled business
    models can be discussed and the value proposition of the technology as a platform
    for sharing tamper-proof information and reducing the costs of transactions can
    be demonstrated and clarified for managers. Consortiums or industry representative
    bodies may also conduct, or offer support to, blockchain applications proof of
    concept (Lacity, 2018), which may give confidence in the new technology and constitute
    a first step towards implementing real solutions. Companies may also conduct industry
    specific collective initiatives to develop and agree on the best practices and
    governance structure for blockchain technology (Casey and Wong, 2017; Behnke and
    Janssen, 2020). Our results also point out the importance of developing universal
    standards for blockchain technology, improving the interoperability between different
    blockchains and with firms'' information systems and establishing appropriate
    and clear governance rules. Thus, solutions providers need to work on adopting
    universal standards for this technology (Janssen et al., 2020) and enhancing interoperability
    between different blockchains, as well as between blockchain and firms'' information
    systems (Wang et al., 2019). Solutions providers may also work with legislators
    and user communities to build appropriate governance structures that define the
    rights and obligations of the different parties involved in blockchain management
    and use and determine the decision-making rules and the procedures for preventing
    information misuse and solving conflicts (Babich and Hilary, 2020). Finally, results
    demonstrate that establishing regulatory framework for using blockchain technology
    is critical with regard to adoption. This suggests that legislators are also required
    to put efforts to create new regulations or adapt the existing ones to support
    blockchain-enabled business models and exchange processes. Indeed, it is widely
    admitted that regulations related to data security and privacy impact the blockchain
    potential use (Lacity, 2018; Wang et al., 2019) and making new regulations or
    changing existing ones may be necessary to support the adoption of this technology.
    7. Limitations and conclusion The limitations to our study are mainly related
    to the respondents'' sample. Our respondents come exclusively from France. This
    may introduce a bias in the results. Future research work may thus be conducted
    in another country, a developing economy for example. Results may then be compared
    with ours for further insights. Special consideration may be given to factors
    like government pressure in these circumstances as presence (or absence) of legislative
    frameworks can alter the scope and possibility of blockchain adoption significantly
    in different geographies. As previously indicated, the transaction cost considered
    in our study refers to the cost of individual transactions. This cost is thus
    different from the overall cost of ownership that should also include the implementation
    cost. Future research may address this issue. Additionally, adopting a theory-driven
    approach, we have focused on identifying a comprehensive list of enablers and
    their inter-relationships as identified from the established theoretical literature.
    Given the emergent nature of technology, a grounded theoretic approach has the
    potential to bring to light new factors that could be explored in subsequent studies.
    However, within its limitations, this study makes a significant contribution to
    extant literature on blockchain adoption in the supply chain. Indeed, our work
    is one of the first empirical studies that attempt to analyze and understand blockchain
    adoption in the supply chain. The findings allowed to uncover the role of 20 enablers
    of blockchain adoption in the supply chain with regard to the adoption decision
    and to establish a series of insights on how to encourage such decision. We found
    that external pressure and relative advantage are the two most prominent categories
    of enablers that impact blockchain adoption in the supply chain. Findings also
    suggest that raising awareness among customers and supply chain professionals
    about the advantages of blockchain over existing technologies is key for stimulating
    its adoption. Our study also reveals that to motivate blockchain adoption in supply
    chains, it is crucial to develop technology standards, provide interoperability
    among different blockchains or between blockchains and firms’ systems, and adapt
    laws and regulations to support blockchain-enabled business models and exchange
    processes. Appendix I. Description of the survey procedure and the questionnaire
    Potential respondents were first approached by e-mail. In a first e-mail, we gave
    potential respondents an explanation of the survey objectives and asked them if
    they were willing to take part to it. The questionnaire was then sent by e-mail
    only to those respondents who accepted to take part to the survey. This second
    e-mail contained a breif reminder of the objectives of the study and two attached
    files: a Word file with the questions and an Excel file that contained the direct
    relation matrix that the respondent should fill in. The questionnaire in the Word
    file was organized in two parts as follows: Part 1 This part contained questions
    with the objective of acquiring the following information: - The size of the company.
    - The sector in which the company is operating. - The department the respondent
    works in. - The position of the respondent in the company. - The number of years
    of experience of the respondent in the current function. - The total number of
    years of experience the respondent has in supply chain or IT related activities.
    Part 2 This part contained one single question with the objective of acquiring
    the respondent''s evaluation of the interdependencies among the twenty enablers.
    The respondent was asked to fill in each cell of the matrix in the Excel file
    by one of the following numbers: 0 if he thinks that there is no impact of the
    factor in the line on the factor in the column of the cell 1 if he thinks that
    there is a low impact of the factor in the line on the factor in the column of
    the cell 2 if he thinks that there is a moderate impact of the factor in the line
    on the factor in the column of the cell 3 if he thinks that there is a high impact
    of the factor in the line on the factor in the column of the cell 4 if he thinks
    that there is a Very High impact of the factor in the line on the factor in the
    column of the cell NB1: The list of the 20 enablers and their definitions were
    supplied in an appendix to the questionnaire. NB2: As one factor could not impact
    itself, we already put “0” in the diagonal. NB3: The Excel file contained a 20
    × 20 with all the enablers listed in the columns and in the lines. To avoid confusion
    and filling errors, A note was incorporated in each cell in the table to indicate
    what the cell should contain. The note gave the full names of the impacting enabler
    in the line of the cell and the impacted enabler in the column. NB4: Analysis

    Abstract: Agriculture plays a vital role in the economic growth of any country.
    With the increase of population, frequent changes in climatic conditions and limited
    resources, it becomes a challenging task to fulfil the food requirement of the
    present population. Precision agriculture also known as smart farming have emerged
    as an innovative tool to address current challenges in agricultural sustainability.
    The mechanism that drives this cutting edge technology is machine learning (ML).
    It gives the machine ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. ML
    together with IoT (Internet of Things) enabled farm machinery are key components
    of the next agriculture revolution. In this article, authors present a systematic
    review of ML applications in the field of agriculture. The areas that are focused
    are prediction of soil parameters such as organic carbon and moisture content,
    crop yield prediction, disease and weed detection in crops and species detection.
    ML with computer vision are reviewed for the classification of a different set
    of crop images in order to monitor the crop quality and yield assessment. This
    approach can be integrated for enhanced livestock production by predicting fertility
    patterns, diagnosing eating disorders, cattle behaviour based on ML models using
    data collected by collar sensors, etc. Intelligent irrigation which includes drip
    irrigation and intelligent harvesting techniques are also reviewed that reduces
    human labour to a great extent. This article demonstrates how knowledge-based
    agriculture can improve the sustainable productivity and quality of the product.

    I. Introduction The population of the world will increase to 9.1 billion approximately
    thirty-four percent as of today by the end of 2050. Food requirement will increase
    by 70 percent and due to rapid urbanization, land availability for agriculture
    will decrease drastically in the coming years. India will be the most populated
    country by 2050 and presently it is already lagging the domestic food production.
    The main reason for reduced food production is the lack of planning, unpredictable
    weather conditions, improper harvesting and irrigation techniques and livestock
    mismanagement. In the last few years, nature has experienced a drastic change
    in weather conditions due to global warming. The average temperature of the earth
    has been increased due to which there is uncertainty in climatic conditions. Frequent
    droughts, heavy rainfall are the biggest challenge for poor farmers. According
    to the government of India annual economic survey, adverse climatic conditions,
    reduce the farmer’s income by 20-25%. Precision agriculture [1], [2] is one of
    the solutions to ensure food security for the entire world [3]. Precision agriculture
    also abbreviated as digital agriculture is a technology-enabled data-driven sustainable
    farm management system. It is basically the adoption of modern information technologies,
    software tools, and smart embedded devices for decision support in agriculture
    [4] as shown in figure 1. Mechanized agriculture and the green revolution are
    the two key components of the first and second agriculture revolution. Precision
    farming is an important part of the third agriculture revolution [5]. FIGURE 1.
    Precision agriculture. Show All John Deere introduced this technology in 1990
    for the sowing of seeds and spraying of fertilizers using global positioning system
    (GPS) controlled tractors. The main focus of precision farming is to reduce the
    production cost and environmental effects to increase the farm’s profitability.
    Digital technologies such as IoT [6], AI, data analytics, cloud computing, and
    block-chain technology play a key role in precision agriculture. In precision
    farming, IoT based smart sensors are deployed in the agriculture land for collecting
    data related to soil nutrients, fertilizers, and water requirements as well as
    for analysing the crop growth. Autonomous and semi-autonomous devices such as
    an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) [7] and robots are used for identifying weed
    and disease in the plants using computer vision techniques. Satellite images are
    also used in precision agriculture for monitoring the field and identifying the
    diseases in the plants. The data obtained from the deployed sensors [8] are processed
    and analyzed using ML algorithms to make farming practice more controlled and
    optimized. ML algorithms are also used for weather and rainfall prediction based
    on the data obtained from sensors, climatic records, and satellite images. This
    could save the lives of thousands of farmers who commit suicide because of crop
    loss due to uncertainty in weather conditions. Smart livestock management is an
    important component of precision agriculture. It helps in monitoring the health,
    welfare, productivity, and reproduction of animals throughout their life cycle.
    Sensors and cameras monitor animal’s health and computer vision techniques help
    in making intelligent decisions such as stopping the communal spread of diseases.
    Autonomous tractors and automated irrigation systems provide modern farming solutions
    to farmers. The widespread utilization of precision farming across the world is
    due to the presence of innovative machine and deep learning (DL) algorithms, high-speed
    internet access, and efficient computational devices. In [10] authors have discussed
    applications of ML for sustainable agriculture supply chain (ASC) performance.
    Authors have presented a unique ML-ASC framework that can guide researchers and
    agriculture practitioners to understand the role and importance of digital technologies
    in the agriculture industry. In [11] authors reviewed different ML applications
    in agriculture and discussed how digital technologies will benefit the agriculture
    industry. In this paper, the authors have presented a comprehensive review of
    the ML application for precision agriculture. This review article will provide
    an insight into the research community about the adoption of digital practices
    in the agriculture management system. It is anticipated that government agencies
    will frame policies to promote precision farming across the world. The main contribution
    of the article is outlined as follows: Applications of artificial intelligence
    and IoT in precision agriculture are discussed along with their practical implications.
    Foundation of ML and DL algorithms which find their application in precision agriculture
    has been discussed. Performance comparison for various ML, DL algorithms in precision
    farming has been carried out based on the state-of-art literature. Assessment

    the paper. TABLE 1 Key Differences of the Article With Published Articles SECTION
    II. Impact of Artificial Intelligence and IoT in Agriculture The term AI was first
    coined in the Dartmouth conference in the year 1956 by John McCarthy and he defined
    it as a science and engineering of making intelligent machines or more specifically
    intelligent computer programs. AI technology provides computational intelligence
    to machines so that they can learn, understand and react according to the situation.
    ML, DL, natural language processing (NLP), swarm intelligence (SI), expert systems,
    fuzzy logic, and computer vision are the subfields of AI as shown in figure 2.
    This field finds endless applications across different sectors of human life.
    Intelligent AI programs are widely explored in health-care, agriculture, finance,
    robotics, e-commerce and the automation industry. Samsung, Apple, and other electronics
    giant companies announced that they will be utilizing this technology in every
    device they will manufacture in the near future. IoT is another emerging technology
    in which smart sensors, devices are interconnected through the internet. These
    smart sensors can be utilized to gather data across different disciplines such
    as solar plants, agriculture fields, disaster-prone areas, manufacturing industry
    for efficient resource utilization. With the increase in population over the year’s
    demand for agriculture products is increasing day by day. However, with limited
    land availability for farming and reduce interest among the young generation to
    adopt farming as their profession, it has become a challenging task for the agriculture
    industry to satisfy the food requirement of millions of people. Now, the agriculture
    industry is widely adopting smart technologies like IoT and AI to efficiently
    cultivate organic products in limited land areas as well as to overcome the traditional
    challenges of farmers. FIGURE 2. Artificial intelligence techniques. Show All
    IoT based smart farming system is built for monitoring soil nutrients and soil
    moisture using sensors. ML algorithms are explored for determining the optimum
    amount of fertilizers required for soils before the sowing of crops. Drones are
    revolutionizing the agriculture industry. These drones are cameras enabled and
    are used for different applications such as field and crop monitoring, spraying
    of pesticides, and drip irrigation. The images captured by the drones over the
    entire lifecycle of crops can be examined using DL and computer vision algorithms
    for disease and weed identification. Thereafter, these drones are used for spraying
    pesticides over the weeds and infected crops. Over the years uncertainty in weather
    conditions is the main concern of farmers. Drip irrigation using drones is an
    efficient AI-empowered irrigation system which is basically trained on weather
    pattern and can effectively reduce the water problems of farmers. AI-enabled robots
    can be used for harvesting the crops at a much faster pace and in large volumes.
    Robots can reduce human labour to a large extent and can be used along with drones
    for monitoring the field. Livestock management is another major concern for farmers.
    IoT based sensors can be deployed in the field for health monitoring of cattle.
    This information can be utilized for protecting the bunch of cattle from diseased
    cattle. NLP based virtual assistant applications like chatbots can update the
    farmers with the latest advancement in technologies for agriculture. Farmers can
    finds solutions for their problems and incorporate the latest technology in their
    farming for improving their field productivity. Thus, AI and IoT are the two major
    technologies that will play a vital role in the agriculture industry. SECTION
    III. Machine Learning Algorithms ML is the subfield of computer science that gives
    computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. (Arthur Samuel,
    1959) [12]. Alan Turing in the year 1950 proposed the concept of learning machines
    and wrote a research article “The Turing Test for Machine Intelligence” [13].
    He performed a test and examined the machine’s ability to demonstrate intelligent
    behaviour similar to humans. A machine or intelligent computer program learns
    and extract knowledge from the data, builds a framework for making predictions
    or intelligent decisions. Thus, the ML process is divided into three key parts,
    i.e. data input, model building, and generalization as shown in figure 3. Generalization
    is the process for predicting the output for the inputs with which the algorithm
    has not been trained before. ML algorithms are mainly used to solve complex problems
    where human expertise fails such as weather prediction, spam filtering, disease
    identification in plants, pattern recognition. FIGURE 3. A Machine learning process.
    Show All Today, due to the availability of innovative algorithms and large data
    sets through internet resources industries and research communities are widely
    using ML algorithms for solving a diverse set of problems. DL is the subfield
    of the family of ML algorithms which is trained from large sets and uses an artificial
    neural network (ANN) to make intelligent decisions. ML algorithms are categorized
    as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning as shown
    in figure 4. Supervised learning as the name suggests is learning with the supervisor
    or teacher. This set of algorithms works with labeled data-set which means corresponding
    to each input there are outputs. The algorithm builds an input-output relationship
    with this labeled data set and thereafter generalize or predicts outputs for unseen
    inputs. Supervised learning algorithms used for predicting the categorical value
    are known as classification algorithms and the algorithms that are used for predicting
    the numerical value are known as regression algorithms. Unsupervised learning
    algorithms works with unlabelled data and discovers unknown objects by grouping
    similar objects. The goal of an unsupervised learning algorithm is to extract
    hidden knowledge from the training data set thus this approach is difficult to
    implement than supervised learning algorithms. Reinforcement learning is another
    approach that learns from the environment through reward and punishment. AlphaGo,
    a chess-playing game developed by DeepMind utilized reinforcement learning for
    defeating the world’s best chess-playing computer program. FIGURE 4. Categorization
    of machine learning algorithms. Show All In this paper the performance of different
    ML algorithms are analysed and discussed in the field of agriculture. Table 2
    presents different types of supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning
    algorithms utilized for soil and weather prediction, disease and weed identification,
    intelligent irrigation and harvesting techniques as well as livestock management.
    TABLE 2 Machine Learning Algorithms SECTION IV. Machine Learning Applications
    in Precision Agriculture In many countries, the farmers rely on the traditional
    ways of farming which is based on the reliability of the suggestions from the
    elderly and their experience. This method leaves farmers at the mercy of random
    climatic conditions which are already getting random due to global warming and
    uneven rainfall patterns. The manual spraying method for pesticides led to improper
    usage of resources and harms the environment. AI and IoT enabled precision agriculture
    removes the randomness and assist new age farmer to optimize every step of the
    farming process. Figure 5 (a) and (b) presents a pictorial view of traditional
    agriculture and technology enabled farm management system. FIGURE 5. (a) Traditional
    agriculture cycle (b) Precision agriculture cycle. Show All Gaitán [14] provided
    a systematic study of the impact of extreme weather events, such as hail events,
    cold waves, heat waves, and their impact on agricultural practices. The author
    reported floods, droughts, frost, hail, heatwaves, and pest outbreaks are impacted
    by climatic conditions. The AI systems are applicable in each farming operation
    as depicted in figure 4 and some of them even extend beyond the conventionally
    recognized steps. In this section we will discuss the state of art techniques
    proposed/implemented by various researchers and practitioners worldwide. A. Soil
    Properties and Weather Prediction Prediction of soil properties is the first and
    the most crucial step which influences the selection of crop, land preparation,
    selection of seed, crop yield, and selection of fertilizers /manure. The soil
    properties are directly related to the geographic and climatic conditions of the
    land in use and hence is an important factor to take into consideration. The soil
    properties prediction mostly consists of predicting nutrients in the soil, soil
    surface humidity, weather conditions during the lifecycle of the crop. Human activities
    have highly affected the properties of soil and hence our ability to cultivate
    the crops [15]. In general, there are 17 essential elements as listed in table
    3 which play an important role in plant growth [16]. The growth of crops depends
    on the nutrients available in a particular soil. The soil nutrients are mostly
    monitored by electric and electromagnetic sensors [8]. Depending on the nutrients
    farmers make informed decisions as to which crop is optimal for the land. However,
    the nutrients can be added through fertilizers, manure, etc. but with an additional
    cost. Some of them may also damage the environment and have an adverse effect
    on the soil cycle. TABLE 3 Essential Plant Nutrients [2] A scientific analysis
    of soil nutrients, soil moisture, pH is important for determining the soil properties.
    Acar et al. [17] employed an extreme learning machine (ELM) based regression model
    for prediction of soil surface humidity. The author selected two terrains having
    area 4 KM2 and 16 KM2 located in Dicle university campus for experimental analysis.
    The real-time field data was extracted using polarimetric Radarsat-2 data, which
    was pre-processed using the SNAP toolbox [18] and features were added with the
    help of local measurements by separating the field into square grids. Once the
    pre-processing and feature extraction is done the data is passed to ELM based
    regression model to predict the soil surface humidity. The algorithm was tested
    with 5 different kernel functions and the prediction was validated using leave-one-out
    cross-validation technique. The experimental results confirmed the lowest root
    mean square error (RMSE) of 2.19% when using ‘sine’ kernel function. Wang et al.
    [19] deployed soft sensors based on ELM for the measurement of nutrient solution
    composition in the soilless cultivation method. The soilless cultivation method
    is an emerging planting method. It is imperative to monitor the pH value, temperature
    and concentration changes in nutrient solution composition as the performance
    of soilless cultivation is highly dependent on these parameters. The significant
    variables in a nutrient solution cannot be measured directly hence these are determined
    with the help of auxiliary variables. The authors utilized conductivity, pH value,
    flow rate, and temperature measurements for auxiliary measurements. These auxiliary
    measurements are fed to a deep belief network-based ELM which predicts the values
    of significant variables. For experimental analysis, the authors deployed the
    model to measure the concentration of SO 2− 4 , and H 2 PO − 4 in a nutrient solution.
    The authors reported an average RMSE of 1.2414 for predictions in SO 2− 4 and
    RMSE of 0.8892 for prediction of H 2 PO − 4 . Park et al. [20] utilized ML algorithms
    to predict the soil moisture using data from MODIS. The authors downscaled the
    AMSR2 soil moisture to 1KM using random forest (RF) and Cubist algorithms. An
    ensemble of these algorithms was used to obtain soil moisture data. The results
    obtained through the ML methods were compared with the statistical ordinary least
    squares technique. The ML model exhibited a R 2 (coefficient of determination)
    of 0.96 and an RMSE of 0.06, whereas a R 2 of 0.47 and a RMSE of 0.16 was associated
    with the statistical ordinary least squares. Reda et al. [21] explored ML algorithms
    to estimate soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) in soil samples
    collected from four agricultural lands of Moroccan. Data set of near-infrared
    spectroscopy is utilized in comparison to traditional chemical methods as this
    technique reduces the computation time and resource utilization. The ensemble
    learning modeling algorithm presents the best performance among other regression
    models and back-propagation neural networks (BPNN) algorithm. The proposed algorithm
    presents R 2 of 0.96, RMSE of 1.92, performance to deviation (RPD) of 4.87 for
    SOC and R 2 of 0.94 and RMSE of 0.57, RPD of 4.91 for TN prediction. Morellos
    et al. [22] also utilized visible and infrared spectroscopy to determine TN, SOC,
    and moisture content (MC) in the arable field in Premslin Germany. Spectroscopy
    dataset is used for building the predictive ML model for estimating all three
    soil properties. Least square support vector machine (LS-SVM) and cubist ML algorithms
    outperform principal component regression and partial least square regression
    multivariate methods in terms of RMSE and residual prediction deviation (RPD).
    LS-SVM best predict SOC and MC with RMSE of 0.062 and 0.457, RPD of 2.24, and
    2.20. Cubist best predicts for TN with RMSE of 0.071 and RPD of 1.96. Andrade
    et al. [23] build ordinary least square regression, RF, cubist regression, XGboost
    prediction model for determining soil properties from portable X-ray fluorescence
    (pXRF) spectrometry dataset in Brazilian coastal plains. Three soil properties
    total nitrogen, soil organic matter (SOM), cation exchange capacity (CEC) were
    analyzed using RF, ordinary least squares regression (OLS), cubist regression
    (CR), XGBoost (XGB). RF algorithm gives the best performance with R 2 of 0.50
    for TN, R 2  0.75 for CEC and 0.56 for SOM. Deiss et al. [24] estimated the soil
    properties (clay, sand, pH, SOC) in northern Tanzania and USA Midwest from the
    spectroscopy dataset using ML algorithms. THE tuned SVM model outperforms the
    partial least square (PLS) regression model in terms of predicting all the soil
    parameters. Mahmoudzadeh et al. [25] explored the ML algorithm to predict SOC
    in the Kurdistan province of Iran. The simulation results suggest that RF accurately
    predicts SOC with R 2 of 0.60 and RMSE of 0.35% in comparison to SVM, kNN, Cubist,
    and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) ML algorithm. The study also suggests
    that air temperature, annual rainfall, valley depth, texture of terrain surface
    are some of the important factors that influence SOC spread over the Kurdistan
    region. Veres et al. [26] explored DL architecture such as CNN for predicting
    the soil properties from the infra-red spectroscopy dataset. Benke et al. [27]
    predict soil electrical conductivity (EC) and SOC in different regional locations
    of Victoria, Australia using pedotransfer function (PTF) based on ML algorithm.
    PTF basically converts soil measurement into soil properties and provides inputs
    for ML simulation algorithms. In the proposed approach PTF use Generalised Linear
    Mixed Effects Model (GLMM) model and Residual Maximum Likelihood (REML) to predict‘
    the soil properties. Traditional approaches to soil properties and crop yield
    prediction require time-consuming field surveys and the deployment of expensive
    sensors. Khanal et al. [28] proposed an alternative approach in which the dataset
    for the prediction of soil properties and crop yield is generated using remotely
    sensed aerial images of agricultural land. Five soil properties, viz. pH value,
    magnesium (Mg), potassium (K), SOM, CEC, and crop yield were predicted using RF,
    SVM, Cubist, NN, Gradient Boosting Model (GBM) ML algorithms. NN presents the
    highest prediction accuracy for SOM having R 2 of 0.64, RMSE of 0.44 and CEC having
    R 2 of 0.67, RMSE of 2.35; SVM best predicts K having R 2 of 0.21, RMSE of 0.49
    and Mg having R 2 of 0.22, RMSE of 4.57; and GBM best predicts pH having R 2 of
    0.15, RMSE of 0.62. RF outperforms other algorithms in terms of crop yield prediction
    and presents higher accuracy having R 2 of 0.53 and RMSE of 0.97. Labrador et
    al. [29] estimate calcium and Mg content in soil using generalized regression
    NN and genetic algorithm (GA). The digital elevation model and satellite images
    were used as input to the prediction model for estimating the soil properties.
    Chlingaryan et al. [30] discussed different ML approaches used in precision agriculture
    for accurate crop yield prediction and soil nitrogen estimation over the last
    fifteen years. Ju-Young et al. [31] investigated a seasonal climatic forecasting
    model using regularized ELM to predict day-wise mean air temperature at field
    level for a period of 90 days. The authors selected data from Korea Metrological
    Administration using the Met GloSea5GC2 model [32]. The authors fed 240 days of
    forecast data and hindcast data from the ensemble based model to the RELM algorithm.
    The algorithm performance was evaluated by measuring: RMSE, mean absolute error
    (MAE) the model prediction vs the actual values. The authors achieved an RMSE
    in the range of 1.02 to 3.35 which outperformed the meteorological data which
    has an RMSE range of 1.61 to 3.37. Soil moisture content is an important parameter
    to acknowledge in the agriculture industry as it addresses precise irrigation
    scheduling. Stamenkovic et al. [33] build a support vector regression (SVR) prediction
    model to predict soil moisture content from remotely sensed hyperspectral images.
    Song et al. [34] proposed a macroscopic cellular automata (MCA) model and combined
    its deep belief network (DBN) to predict soil moisture content over a cornfield
    in northwest china. The simulation results of DBN-MCA outperforms the multi-layer
    perceptron (MLP)-MCA in terms of RMSE. Acheing [35] explored the SVR model (i.e.
    RBF), ANN, DNN for simulating soil water retention curve (SWRC) curve of loamy
    sand. Dataset of loamy sand subjected to wetting and drying condition is collected
    using a reflectometer and tensiometer. RBF based SVR model best predicts SWRC
    under both wet and dry conditions. Feng et al. [36] estimate soil temperature
    at various soil depths of Loess Plateau of China. Four different ML algorithms
    ELM, generalized regression neural networks (GRNN), backpropagation neural networks
    (BPNN), and RF were investigated for predicting the soil temperature. ML algorithms
    were trained with air temperature, wind speed, relative humidity, and vapour pressure
    and solar radiation as input parameters and the simulations show that ELM outperforms
    other ML algorithms in terms of RMSE, MAE, Nash–Sutcliffe coefficient (NS) and
    concordance correlation coefficient. Mohammadi et al. [37] explored ELM for predicting
    daily dew point temperature in different parts of Iran. This part of the world
    experience different climatic conditions throughout the year. The proposed model
    accurately predicts dew point temperature than SVM and ANN algorithms. Zhu et
    al. [38] accurately predict daily evapotranspiration in Northwest China using
    hybrid particle swarm optimization (PSO)-ELM model to optimize crop water requirement
    in agriculture. Alizamir et al. [39] accurately predicts soil temperature at different
    depths of 5, 10, 50 and 100 cm using ELM, ANN, classification and regression trees,
    group method of data handling using dataset obtained from Mersin station operated
    by Turkish Meteorological Service. The simulation results suggest that soil temperature
    can be estimated easily using air temperature upto depth of 50 cm while for depth
    of 100 cm additional information of solar radiation and wind speed is required.
    Rainfall prediction plays a critical role in the water resource management system,
    flood risk assessment, and the agriculture industry. Acknowledging the chaotic
    nature of rainfall, it is very difficult for statistical approaches to accurately
    predict the rainfall. Cramer et al. [40] evaluated the performance of seven ML
    algorithms for rainfall prediction. The statistical results show that the radial-basis
    function neural network (RBFNN) shows the best performance among other state of
    the art algorithms. Sierra and Jesus [41] predicted the rainfall in Tenerife,
    an island in Spain based on atmospheric synoptic patterns using different ML algorithms
    and found NN gave the best performance among other ML algorithms. Kamatchi and
    Parvathi [42] employed NN for weather prediction and proposed a hybrid recommender
    system for enhancing the success ratio of the system. Lazri et al. [43] build
    a multi-classifier model for estimating precipitation using MSG images (Meteosat
    second generation) and dataset obtained using radar. The proposed approach shows
    that the proposed multi-classifier improves the standard of classification. Shardoor
    and Rao [44] surveyed three different approaches i.e. ML techniques, data mining
    techniques, and satellite forecasting techniques for rainfall prediction. Table
    4 presents a comparative study of different ML algorithms for prediction of soil
    properties and weather prediction. TABLE 4 Different ML Algorithms for Prediction
    of Soil Properties and Weather Conditions B. Crop Yield Prediction A significant
    piece of information for any farmer is the prediction of crop yield and how the
    yield can be increased. pH value, soil type, and quality, weather pattern: temperature,
    rainfall, humidity, sunshine hours, fertilizers, and harvesting schedules are
    some of the parameters which play an important role in predicting the crop yield
    [45]. Scientifically manual farming can be considered as a feedback control system
    in which the corrective action is taken once a setback in a crop is observed.
    The crop yield will highly depend on the efficiency of the optimal utilization
    of the above-mentioned resources. If some kind of anomaly goes undetected in the
    initial stage may harm the crop yield in an unprecedented way. Singh et al. [46]
    assessed hailstorms on India’s wheat production and observes that in February
    and March 2015 alone the hailstorm events caused a decline of 8.4% in national
    wheat production. For financially weak farmers in a country such as India, where
    intermittent storage of harvested crops is a rare resource, accurate weather predictions
    may turn to be miraculous for farmers. ML models when systematically applied to
    a system act as feedforward control. With the help of accurate ML models, we can
    anticipate the factors which are going to affect the crop yield. Hence the corrective
    action can be taken before even an anomaly hits the crop production. Kamir et
    al. [47] used ML models to identify the yield gap hotspots in wheat production.
    Authors generated very high-resolution yield maps using data from various sources
    between 2009 and 2015. The data was collected from various sources:(a) NDVI time-series
    data across Australia using the MOD13Q1 data set [48], (b) rainfall and temperature
    data were collected from historic climate data at Australia bureau of metrology,
    (c) maps for observed grain yield were collected at source using intelligent harvesting
    machines. The dataset generated were tested with 9 ML algorithms: RF, XGBoost,
    Cubist, MLP, SVR, Gaussian Process, k-NN, and Multivariate Adaptive Regression
    Splines. The authors combined predictions from each of the algorithms into ensembles
    for prediction optimization [49]. Out of these algorithms, SVR with RBFNN outperformed
    other algorithms and investigators were able to achieve the yield estimate with
    an R 2  of 0.77 and an RMSE value of 0.55t ha −1 . The results were validated
    using 10-fold cross-validation techniques applied to the full data set. Aghighi
    et al. [50] used various advanced regression algorithms to predict the yield of
    silage maize crops. The authors selected maize fields located at Moghan Agro-Industrial
    and Animal Husbandry Company (MAIAHC), which is about 28,000 hectares’ area and
    located in Iran. The crop yield dataset was collected for around 40 silage maize
    fields were collected for a period from 2013-2015. In addition to it, the historic
    crop yield data the authors also gathered time-series NDVI data from Landsat 8
    OLI satellite. The data was fed to advanced regression algorithms: (a) Gaussian
    Process Regression, (b) SVR, (c) Boosted Regression tree (d) RF Regression models
    and the prediction form each of the regression models were compared and evaluated.
    Authors found out the boosted regression tree reported best evaluation parameters
    with an average R-value of higher than 0.87, and RMSE in a range of 8.5 to 11.10,
    with a mean value of 9.5 during the period 2013-14. Kuwata and Shibasaki [51]
    employed DL models to estimate the crop yield. Authors deployed SVR for predicting
    the yield of corn in Illinois. For input following dataset was employed by the
    authors: (a) 5 year moving average of corn crop yield, (b) The enhanced vegetation
    index is obtained using the MOD09A1 dataset MODIS satellite, and (c) Historic
    climatic data. The dataset was fed to support the vector regression model and
    the authors reported an RMSE of 8.204 and a correlation coefficient of 0.644 for
    the model. For result, validation authors conducted 10-fold cross-validation on
    the full data set. Kulkarni et al. [52] utilized DL models to predict rice crop
    yield. The authors utilized soil properties and nutrients measurements recorded
    over 31 years and historic rainfall data. The input data was fed to recurrent
    neural network models for crop yield prediction. For effective prediction the
    authors explored different activation functions viz. sigmoid, reLu, and linear
    in the neural network. Chu and Yu [53] builds an end to end summer and winter
    rice prediction model in 81 counties in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region,
    China. The proposed BBI model works in three stages, in the first stage the original
    area data and time series metrological data is pre-processed and its output works
    as input for the second stage where BPNN and RNN (recurrent neural network) learns
    deep spatial and temporal features from the input data. In the third stage, BPNN
    learns the relationship between deep features and rice yield to predict the summer
    and winter rice yields. The performance of the model is evaluated in terms of
    error and rate of convergence, the model presents lowest error values with MAE
    and RMSE of 0.0044 and 0.0057 for summer rice prediction and 0.0074 and 0.0192
    for winter rice prediction while the algorithm converges within 100 iterations.
    Feng et al. [54] proposed a hybrid approach for wheat yield prediction in new-south
    Wales in southeastern Australia. Multiple growth specific indicators, viz. agricultural
    production system simulators (APSIM), NDVI, and SPEI (Standardized Precipitation
    and Evapotranspiration Index) are used before the prediction of wheat yield using
    regression models (multiple linear regression (MLR) and RF). APSIM+ RF hybrid
    model presents the best performance among other predictors in terms of prediction
    accuracy. Cai et al. [55] integrated two data sources, i.e. climate data and satellite
    data over fourteen years to predict the wheat yield in Australia using ML algorithms
    (SVM, RF, and NN). Simulation results show that climate data provides distinctive
    information in comparison to satellite data for yield prediction with R 2 of around
    0.75. Planting the crops on accurate date plays an important role in improving
    productivity and reducing financial loss. Gumuscu et al. [56] explored three supervised
    ML algorithms; kNN, SVM, and decision trees for predicting planting dates; early,
    normal, and late for wheat crops in Turkey. The authors utilized climate data
    of the last 300 days to train ML algorithms and explored GA for feature selection.
    kNN classification ML algorithm shows robust performance and best predicts the
    planting dates of wheat crops. Several African, American, and Asian countries
    are the major producer of coffee in the world. Nevavuori et al. [57] explored
    a deep learning approach, i.e. CNN for wheat and barley yield prediction in the
    agriculture field of Pori, Finland. NDVI and RGB dataset obtained from cameras
    installed in UAV is used to train the six-layer CNN. RGB dataset best predicts
    the crop yield in CNN with MAE of 484.3 kgha−1 and mean absolute percentage error
    (MAPE) of 8.8%. Koirala et al. [58] reviewed deep learning approaches for fruit
    detection and yield estimation. CNN in the context of computer vision is widely
    used for feature extraction from images that provide useful insight to object
    detection and yield estimation. Kouadio, et al. [59] predicted the Robusta coffee
    yield using ML techniques from soil fertility dataset of Vietnam. ELM model outperforms
    multiple linear regression and RF algorithm with RMSE of 496.35 kg ha−1 and MAE
    of 326.40 kg ha−1. Gamboa et al. [60] predict the cocoa yield in Santander, Columbia
    using a generalized linear model (GLM) and SVM. In recent decades researchers
    have explored statistical and probabilistic models for crop yield prediction.
    Gyamerah et al. [61] proposed a novel robust probabilistic forecasting model based
    on quantile random forest and Epanechnikov kernel function (QRF-E) for crop yield
    prediction in Ghana. The proposed approach didn’t only predict discrete yield
    values but completely showcase probability descriptions for prediction interval
    for the two crops groundnut and millet. The simulation result shows the superior
    performance of the proposed algorithm in terms of prediction intervals coverage
    probability and prediction interval normalized average width under uncertain weather
    conditions. Peng et al. [62] explored remote sensed satellite-based Solar-Induced
    Chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) dataset for training ML algorithms to predict maize
    and soybean yield in the mid-west region of the United States. Simulation results
    show that non-linear algorithms such as SVM, ANN, RF best predict the crop yield
    in comparison to least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression (LASSO)
    and ridge regression (RIDGE) algorithm. Khaki and Wang [63] predicted the hybrid
    maize yield with a dataset of 2,267 locations of the United States and Canada
    between the years 2008 to 2016 using deep neural networks (DNN). Genotype, weather,
    and soil properties were the three components used to train DNN. The proposed
    model accurately predicts the maize yield with RMSE of 12% of the average yield
    for predicted weather dataset and 11% of the average yield for perfect weather
    dataset and outperforms LASSO, shallow neural network (SNN) and regression tree
    (RT). Simulation results show that environmental factors have a large impact on
    the prediction accuracy of crop yield. In most areas of Africa, agriculture field
    data is scarcely available thus remotely sensed dataset is widely used for monitoring
    the field. Leroux et al. [64] explored the ML algorithm for predicting the maize
    yield in Burkina Faso with a remotely sensed dataset. A process-based crop model
    SARRO which is basically designed to simulate attainable agricultural yields under
    tropical conditions is used in this study. RF outperforms MLR in maize yield prediction
    with R 2 of 0.59 at the end of the season and 0.49 before two months of harvest.
    Li et al. [65] build a statistical model for predicting the rain-fed crop yield
    using climate, satellite, and country-specific datasets in the mid-west region
    of the USA. Maimaitijiang et al. [66] explored the potential of UAV with DNN for
    soybean yield prediction from the fields of Columbia, Missouri, USA. Multi-modal
    information such as canopy spectral, structural, and thermal features extracted
    from images obtained from the sensors installed on UAV is used as the input dataset
    for training DNN. The simulation result shows that DNN accurately predict the
    crop yield and outperforms partial least square regression (PLSR), RF, SVR algorithms
    with R 2 of 0.720 and RMSE of 15.9%. Zhang et al. [67] explored ANN for prediction
    of annual crop planting utilizing a historical cropland data layer (CDL) dataset
    of corn-belt of mid-west, USA. Kocian et al. [68] utilized both approaches to
    predict crop growth in greenhouses. IoT smart sensors are installed in the greenhouses
    to monitor different environmental parameters, soil properties and plant growth
    parameters such as leaf area index (LAI), accumulated dry weight (DW) and evapo-transpiration
    (ET). These parameters are in real-time send to the cloud through IoT devices
    and permit the implementation of an agriculture decision-support system. The probabilistic
    Bayesian network is explored in the proposed system to predict crop development
    parameters. Shahinfar and Kahn [69] explored ML algorithms for early prediction
    of adult wool growth in Merino sheep of Australia. Model Tree algorithms best
    predict the wool growth in comparison with NN with a correlation coefficient of
    0.93, 0.90, 0.94, 0.81 and 0.59, MAE of 0.48 kg, 0.41 kg, 0.92 μm , 6.91mm and
    6.82 N/ktex, for predicting Greasy Fleece Weight, adult Clean Fleece Weight, adult
    Fibre Diameter and adult Staple Length. Table 5 presents a comparative study of
    different ML algorithms for crop yield prediction. TABLE 5 Different ML Algorithms
    for Crop Yield Prediction C. Disease and Weed Detection Disease fungi, microorganisms,
    and bacteria take their energy from the plants they live on, which in turn affects
    the crop yield. If not detected at the right time may account for a huge economic
    loss to farmers. A lot of financial burden goes to a farmer in the form of pesticides,
    to get rid of diseases and restore the functioning of crops. Excessive use of
    pesticides also leads to environmental damage and the effects of the water and
    soil cycle of the agricultural land. Using an optimally designed AI system during
    crop growth period not only reduces the risk of crop disease and minimizes the
    economic impact, but it also results in minimizing the adverse impact of unsystematic
    farming on the environment. Sambasivan and Opiyo [70] used a CNN based DL model
    to detect disease in cassava crops for imbalanced datasets. The authors took a
    database of 10,000 labeled images that were pre-processed to improve the image
    contrast using contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization algorithm. The
    model evaluation was done using the performance metrics: confusion matrix, accuracy
    measure, precision measure, sensitivity, and F1 score. The authors reported a
    best-case accuracy of 99.30% and the lowest accuracy was reported as 76.9%. Ramcharan
    et al. [71] used DL algorithms to detect diseases in cassava crops. Authors deployed
    deep CNN to identify three different diseases and two types of pests from a set
    of 11,670 images dataset. Author’s utilized GoogLeNet algorithm based Inception
    v3 in Tensor Flow. The authors achieved efficiency in a range of 80% to 93.0%,
    and the validation of the results was done with the help of the confusion matrix.
    Mohanty et al. [72] employed DL methods to detect crop disease from the image
    dataset of plant leaves. The authors used a public database consisting of smartphone
    generated 54,306 images of diseased and healthy plants leaves. These images were
    resized to 256×256 pixels and were assigned 38 different class labels of crop-disease
    pair, and transformed into 3 datasets color, grayscale and segmented. The dataset
    was then fed to two of the most common deep CNNs: AlexNet [73] and GoogLeNet [74].
    The authors achieved an accuracy of 99.34% for GoogLeNet, and an accuracy of 85.53%
    for AlexNet network. The results were validated using F1 score, authors achieved
    a mean F1 score of 0.9886 for GoogLeNet, and a mean F1 score of 0.9848 for AlexNet.
    Amara et al. [75] used LeNet based CNN architecture for disease detection in banana
    leaves. Authors utilized data from open source local and digital libraries which
    were pre-processed and resized to 60×60 pixels, and the model was implemented
    for RGB as well as grayscale images. Hughes and Salathe [76] utilized this developed
    model for the identification of diseases in the images dataset. The authors achieved
    the best F1 score of 0.9971 for detection in RGB images and a score of 0.976 for
    grayscale images. Ferreira et al. [77] deployed CNN for the identification of
    weeds in soybean crops. The image dataset for soy plantation located at São José
    farm, Campo Grande Brazil was acquired using phantom DJI3 drone. The images are
    segmented using the SLIC algorithm into square grids. For training, the segmented
    images were manually annotated to their class. The segmented images dataset was
    fed to AlexNet (a convolution neural network) for classification. The performance
    of the AlexNet was compared with SVM, AdaBoost, and RF. To evaluate the performance
    of the AlexNet the model was fed with a balanced dataset and the authors reported
    an overall accuracy of above 90% and 96.3% images were correctly classified. Waheed
    et al. [78] proposed a cost-effective optimized dense CNN (DenseNet) for disease
    detection in corn leaves with an accuracy of 98.0%. Simulation results show that
    the proposed model outperforms other CNN models such as EfficientNet, VGG19Net,
    NASNet, and XceptionNet in terms of fewer parameters, accuracy, computation complexity,
    and computation time. Pereira et al. [79] proposed an expert system for identifying
    three species of aquatic weeds from aquatic weed leaves dataset based on their
    shape and supervised pattern recognition techniques. The author explored five
    shape descriptors with different shape-based skills viz. Beam Angle Statistics
    (BAS), Fourier Descriptors (FD), Moment Invariants (MI), Multi-scale Fractal dimension
    (MS), and Tensor Scale Descriptor (TSD) along with five ML algorithms viz. Optimum-Path
    Forest (OPF), SVM, Naive Bayes, ANN, MLP. Simulation results show that OPF using
    the BAS-100 descriptor presents the best results with a recognition rate of 96.41%
    in comparison to other approaches. Jiang et al. [80] proposed a semi-supervised
    CNN feature-based Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) for identifying weeds utilizing
    6000 images of corn, lettuce, radish, and mixed weed dataset. The proposed approach
    works in two parts, i.e. in the first part CNN model is used for feature extraction
    thereafter in the second part GCN graph is explored utilizing CNN feature dataset
    for extracting feature of an unlabelled dataset using labelled dataset. The proposed
    approach shows the best results in comparison with AlexNet, VGG16, and ResNet-101
    approaches with recognition accuracies of 97.80%, 99.37%, 98.93%, and 96.51% on
    four different weed datasets. Oppenheim and Shani [81] explored CNN for identifying
    four different types of diseases in potatoes. The simulation result shows that
    the model trained on 90% of the images and tested on 10% of images give the best
    results with 96% accuracy. Sugar beet contributes around 30% of world sugar production.
    Leaf spot diseases in sugar beet can create a loss of around 10 % to 50 % of yearly
    sugar yield. Rumpf et al. [82] proposed SVM with a radial basis function as a
    kernel based model for early detection and classification of three diseases Cercospora,
    leaf spot, leaf rust, and powdery mildew in sugar beet leaves. Diseased and non-diseased
    leaves were classified with an accuracy of 97% and three diseases were identified
    with accuracy higher than 86%. Ozguven and Adem [83] proposed updated faster R-CNN
    for leaf spot disease identification and classification in sugar beet. Leaf spot
    disease initially generates as small circular spots and later spread over the
    entire leaf surface. The proposed R-CNN architecture changes its parameters according
    to the images and the disease infected regions, which improves the overall classification
    rate to 95.48%. Bah et al. [84] explored CNN for weed detection in images obtained
    using UAV from bean and spinach fields. The proposed model first identifies the
    crop rows and then identifies the inter-crop row weeds which are used as a training
    dataset for CNN for crop and weed identification and classification. Kerkech et
    al. [85] identified the vine diseases from visible and infrared UAV images obtained
    in the Center Val de Loire region in France. A CNN model is trained with this
    dataset of images to classify each pixel according to different instances, namely,
    shadow, ground, healthy, and symptom. The model identifies with an accuracy of
    92% at grapevine-level and 87% at leaf level. Oslen et al. [86] explored robust
    deep learning models Inception-v3 and ResNet-50 for weed species identification
    and classification from a dataset of images collected in Australian rangeland.
    Simulation results show that the average classification performance of both the
    models is 95.1% and 95.7%. These results found fruitful for automatic real-time
    robotic weed control in the agricultural field. Sudars et al. [87] establish an
    experimental set up with RGB digital cameras in Latvia to collect images of the
    field having 6 food crops and 8 weed species grown in normal field conditions
    and controlled environment. This dataset can be utilized by deep learning algorithms
    for weed identification and classification. Sethy et al. [88] identified the rice
    leaf disease based on a hybrid CNN and SVM. In this model, CNN is explored for
    deep feature extraction from 5932 diseased rice leaf images and this data is used
    as input for SVM classifier. The resnet50 with SVM classification model best classify
    with respect to other models with F1 score of 0.9838. Garcia et al. [89] proposed
    an ML and DL learning hybrid approach for weed and crop identification in the
    agriculture fields of Greece. Image dataset of two crops tomato and cotton and
    two weeds black nightshade and velvetleaf was generated for training and testing
    of the model. Initially CNN (Xception, Inception-Resnet, Vignette’s, Mobilenet,
    and Densenet)) is used for feature extraction and this feature set is later used
    to train ML classifier (SVM, XGBoost and Logistic Regression) for classification.
    The simulation result shows that Densenet and Support Vector Machine outperforms
    other approaches with F1 score of 99.29%. Shah and Jain [90] identified the disease
    in cotton leaf through ANN with some image pre-processing techniques. Yu et al.
    [91] explored deep learning algorithms with a dataset of images for identifying
    dandelion, ground ivy, and spotted spurge in perennial ryegrass. Parraga-Alava
    et al. [92] generated a robusta coffee leaf image dataset (RoCoLe) for disease
    identification using ML algorithms. Glezakos et al. [93] proposed an innovative
    method to identify two viruses Tobacco Rattle Virus (TRV) and the Cucumber Green
    Mottle Mosaic Virus (CGMMV) in plants. In the proposed research Bio-Electric Recognition
    Assay (BERA) technique is utilized to obtain time-series information of the two
    viruses by measuring the waves through biosensors for 331s. This time-series data
    is preprocessed using GA to eliminate noise and for dimensionality reduction of
    a large dataset. Thereafter this meta-data is used to train MLP neural network
    classifier. The proposed model is tested against other ML classifiers via cross-validation.
    Ramesh and Vydeki [94] explored optimized deep NN with the Jaya algorithm for
    the identification of paddy leaf diseases. A dataset of rice plant leaves was
    taken from the agricultural field to identify and classify normal, bacterial blight,
    brown spot, sheath rot, and blast diseases. Simulation results show that the proposed
    model accurately classifies the diseased and normal images with an accuracy of
    98.9%, 95.78%, 92%, 94%, and 90.57% for blast affected, bacterial blight, sheath
    rot, brown spot, and normal rice leaf images. Chechlin’ ski et al. [95] explored
    CNN for weed identification in four plant species at different growth level and
    under varying light conditions. CNN architecture combines U-Net, MobileNets, DenseNet,
    and ResNet models for classification of weeds in crops. In [96]–[99] author has
    reviewed machine and deep learning techniques for weed, pests and disease identification,
    and classification in crops at different growth stages. Table 6 presents a comparative
    study of different ML algorithms for disease and weed identification. TABLE 6
    Different ML Algorithms for Disease and Weed Identification D. Drip Irrigation
    In the modern era, irrigation for crops has been improvised using the concept
    of drip irrigation [100], where the system consists of thin plastic tubes placed
    in or above the soil along the vertical rows of the plants for nurturing the water
    supply to the crops. Employing the proper operational management of drip irrigation,
    minimizes the utilization of water supply for crop production, and provides a
    better yield of crops. Socio-economic and environmental demands have widely appreciated
    in use of drip irrigation on farmlands for agriculture, especially for the high
    cost valued crops i.e., vegetables and fruits. Furthermore, drip irrigation is
    based on the low-pressure watering system in comparison to sprinkler systems;
    this makes the system more efficient in terms of energy consumption [101]. Various
    advantages have been observed using drip irrigation in agriculture over other
    irrigation systems which include sub-irrigation systems or sprinkler irrigation
    systems. These advantages are entitled to minimal usage of water supply, usage
    of soluble fertilizers through a drip irrigation system, automated system, minimization
    of soil erosion, uninterrupted activities, minimized weed problems, facilitation
    of double-cropping. Precision irrigation is another innovative approach in intelligent
    farming where it uses the water intelligently that further helps the farmers to
    achieve better yield in crops with minimal water usage. It can also be featured
    as providing the right amount of water, at the right time and the right place
    in the field. It focuses its implementation based on variable rate irrigation
    (VRI) methods employing drips or sprinklers. [102]–[104]. Advancements in the
    field of on-farm sensor technologies, weather forecasting, IoT based sensor detection
    system of vegetation and precision-based smart irrigation produces a huge size
    of data that ultimately benefits the farmers in optimizing the usage of water
    resources, improve the yield of crops and maximizes the profit of farmers [105].
    ML and DL and reinforcement learning are employed on the historical data and it
    provides various opportunities for real-time prediction and decision making purposes
    for smart irrigation which are solely based on the data collected by the sensors
    and IoT enabled systems [106]–[109]. Roberts et al. [110] have discussed that
    a sensor-based control system might create some bottleneck in terms of reducing
    the reliability of decision support tools on process-based crop models, which
    further may require costly calibration and affect in generating an uncertain representation
    of soil-plant-atmosphere processes. Further, ML techniques have been employed
    extremely well for protection analysis of hydrological processes i.e., soil moisture
    and groundwater levels [111], [112]. Li et al. [113] utilized ANN for estimating
    nitrate distribution in different types of soils under a drip irrigation system.
    Kavianand et al. [114] proposed a fully automated drip irrigation system based
    on the ARM9 processor along with different kinds of sensors equipped for monitoring
    the PH content and nitrogen content of the soil and controlling the irrigation
    of the field. Emmanuel et al. [115] establishes an experimental set-up in a greenhouse
    in Malaysia to monitor the growth of mustard leaf vegetable plants through IoT
    devices and alongside developed a data-driven model of drip irrigation system.
    Soil moisture, irrigation volume, evapotranspiration were measured through sensors
    and were given to the Raspberry Pi 3 controller for storing it in the cloud. This
    data was utilized by different predictive models ARX, BJ, and state-space models
    to predict soil moisture content for an optimized drip irrigation system. ARX
    model outperforms other predictive models in terms of MSE and response time. Seyedzadeh
    et al. [116] explored ML algorithms to optimize the uniform emitter discharge
    rate of drip irrigation system under varying pressure and temperature conditions.
    In this model operating pressure, water temperature, discharge coefficient, pressure
    exponent, and nominal discharge were taken as input parameters while ration of
    emitter discharge to nominal discharge is taken as output temperature. Authors
    explored four different ML algorithms for optimizing emitter discharge rate and
    simulation results show that LS-SVM presents best results with the least error
    of mean absolute error. Peng et al. [117] utilize soil moisture, soil electrical
    conductivity, air temperature, and light intensity parameters to build an optimized
    irrigation prediction model using backpropagation NN in China. The proposed prediction
    model presents good results with MSE of 0.00857724. The authors also identified
    an optimized layout and network arrangement for pipe in a drip irrigation system
    using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software. The simulation results present
    that the H-shaped network layout is more suitable for field crop irrigation than
    the comb-shaped and fish bone-shaped layout. Drip irrigation system gives the
    best performance when the wetting front dimension, i.e. diameter, depth, and upward
    movement are optimized. Shiri et al. [118] explored soft-computing approaches
    viz., gene expressions programming (GEP), and RF techniques in modeling wetting
    front dimensions over different soil types for surface and sub-surface irrigation
    system. Proposed model, best predicts ETc with an improved correlation coefficient
    and decreases MSE and MAE. Elnesr and Alazba [119] explored ANN for predicting
    the wetting front dimensions from the dataset of a well-tested HYDRUS 2D/3D model.
    The simulation results show that the proposed model has a good correlation of
    0.93-0.99. Chang et al. [120] developed a smart irrigation model based on ML with
    the LoRa P2P network to learn the irrigation experiences from the expert farmers
    working on greenhouse organic crops. Singh et al. [121] have discussed an ML and
    IoT based model for soil moisture prediction during irrigation. Torres-Sanchez
    et al. [122] proposed a decision support system for irrigation management of citric
    crops in southeast Spain. In the proposed model smart sensors are deployed in
    the field to monitor water supplied previous week, weather data, soil water status,
    and based on this data three regression models SVM, RF, and Linear regression
    was trained to build the irrigation decision support system. RF best predicts
    with comparatively less prediction error. Hellín et al. [123] explored the Partial
    Least Square Regression (PLSR) and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS)
    model for building a smart irrigation decision support system crops in southeast
    Spain. Goumopoulos et al. [124] proposed a real-time adaptable intelligent and
    autonomous closed-loop irrigation management system. The authors built an experimental
    set-up in a greenhouse and deployed wireless sensors for monitoring the plant
    growth and environmental conditions along with plant growth control actuators.
    Estimation of evapotranspiration (ETc) plays a vital role in water resource management
    system. Chen et al. [125] estimate crop actual ETc from temporal convolution network
    (TCN) from the dataset of lysimeters for maize under drip irrigation with film
    mulch. Simulation results show that the proposed model best predicts ETc with
    an improved correlation coefficient and decreases MSE and MAE. Table 7 presents
    a comparative study of different ML algorithms for drip irrigation. TABLE 7 Different
    ML Algorithms for Drip Irrigation E. Livestock Production and Management Livestock
    production is basically related to the production and management of cattle i.e.,
    sheep, pigs, etc. for human consumption in terms of meat. Livestock production
    and their management are based on the farming parameters of these cattle i.e.,
    health, food, nutrition, and behaviour to optimize their production in such a
    way that the economic efficiency of this livestock can be maximized. In the present
    scenario, Artificial intelligence, IoT and Blockchain technologies [126] are widely
    explored to improves livestock sustainability and for analysis of their chewing
    habits, eating patterns, their movement patterns i.e., standing, moving, drinking
    and feeding habits, indicate the amount of stress the animal is going through
    which in turn helps in predicting the vulnerability to disease, weight gain, and
    production of the livestock. Furthermore, an ML-based weight predicting system
    can help in the estimation of their body weight 90–180 days before the slaughtering
    day. According to these analyses and estimations, farmers can change their diet
    plans and living conditions for their better growth in terms of health, behaviour,
    and weight gain which in turn will improve the economic efficiency of these livestock
    [127], [128]. Villeneuve et al. [129] build a decision support system that encounters
    not only real-time data but also expert knowledge for precision sheep farming.
    Livestock production and management can be further classified into two sub-categories,
    i.e., animal welfare and livestock production. Animal welfare generally deals
    with the animal’s health and their well-being; for this ML techniques are applied
    to their health monitoring feature for prospective of early disease detection.
    Whereas, livestock production employs the ML on the estimation of the balanced
    production of livestock for the producers to achieve economic benefits. Dutta
    et al. [130] described a procedure for the classification of cattle behaviour
    employing the ML techniques for data collection using collar-based sensors i.e.,
    magnetometers and three-axis accelerometers. In this study, events such as oestrus
    and dietary changes on cattle have been analyzed for their well-nutrition. Pegorini
    et al. [131] presented an automatic identification and classification of chewing
    habits of claves employing ML-based techniques for analysing their health and
    behavioural patterns. Ebrahimie et al. [132] proposed ML predictive model for
    estimating Sub-Clinical Mastitis (SCM) from milking parameters in dairy herds.
    Mastitis is an inflammatory disease that is widely affecting the dairy industry.
    Author’s explored four classification models decision trees, stump decision trees,
    parallel decision trees, and random forest to discover SCC independent of Somatic
    Cell Count (SCC) which is widely used to measure SCM worldwide. RF with Gini Index
    criteria best predicts SCM with an accuracy of 90%. Ebrahimie et al. [133] explored
    the attribute weighting model (AWM) for identifying lactose concentration and
    electrical conductivity in milk, which are two of the major indicators of SCM
    in dairy cattle. Hyde et al. [134] also explored RF to predict the route of transmission
    of germs and classify them into contagious (CONT) or environmental (ENV) with
    ENV further sub-classified into non-lactating “dry” period (EDP) or lactating
    period (EL). The simulation results show that an accuracy of 98% was achieved
    for discovering CONT vs ENV and 78% for discovering EDP and EL. Esener et al.
    [135] utilized spectral profiles dataset to discriminates CONT and ENV strains
    using GA, NN, and quick classifier. Ebrahimi et al. [136] predicted sub-clinical
    bovine mastitis using a large milking dataset collected through an automated in-line
    monitoring system in commercial New Zealand dairy farm. The simulation results
    show that GBM outperforms other ML model and best predict sub-clinical bovine
    mastitis with an accuracy of 84.9%. Sharifi et al. [137] explored meta-analysis
    and decision trees data mining tools to discover genes that can help to find mastitis
    in dairy cattle. Machado et al. [138] explored the RF model to identify factors
    influencing the occurrence of Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) viral disease
    in cattle in southern Brazil. The proposed approach identifies that insemination,
    the number of cattle in neighbouring farms, and routine rectal palpation are among
    the main factors of the occurrence of this disease. Matthews et al. [139] developed
    an ML-based automated monitoring system for tracking animal behaviour and movement
    i.e., standing, moving, feeding, and drinking by employing the depth video cameras
    and sensors. Qiao et al. [140] explored the DL technique Mask R-CNN for examining
    cattle health and welfare information in precision livestock management. The proposed
    model extract key features from image frames, enhance the image to remove non-uniform
    illumination shadow influences, segment image of cattle from the background image
    using the Mask R-CNN DL tool, and lastly extract cattle contour lines from the
    segmented image. The proposed approach outperforms SharpMask and DeepMask image
    segmentation models with mean pixel accuracy of 0.92 and an average distance error
    of 33.56 pixels. Liakos et al. [141] explored ML model for predicting healthy
    cattle and cattle suffering from lameness utilizing basic features of cattle which
    includes per day habits of cattle like steps taken, overall walking, lying, and
    eating habits. Morales et al. [142] employed a method based on SVM for early detection,
    warnings, and production issues of eggs in the poultry farms. The simulation results
    show that the proposed technique alerts a day before with an estimation accuracy
    of 0.9854. The identification of livestock is an important aspect of monitoring
    growth and animal welfare. Hansen et al. [143] explored deep learning techniques
    CNN for identifying pigs faces from the dataset of digital images of pigs obtained
    from commercial farm environment where the parameters such as dirt and lighting
    are highly unpredictable. The proposed approach accurately predicts the faces
    with an accuracy of 96.7%. Fenlon et al. [144] build a decision support system
    using predictive ML algorithms to provide calving assistance in the dairy industry.
    Four ML techniques multimodal regression, decision trees, RF, and NN were explored
    to predict three calving difficulties unassisted, slight assistance, and veterinary
    assistance. The simulation result shows that NN and multimodal regression models
    accurately classify 75% of calving difficulties with an average prediction error
    of 3.7% and 4.5%. Fenlon et al. [145] analyzed calving difficulties in dairy herds
    in Ireland using ML algorithms. A dataset of parity, log days in milk, inter-service
    interval, difficulties faced in the last calving, herd body conditions were built
    to predict conceptions using artificial insemination in the Iris dairy industry.
    Logistic regression outperforms RF, decision trees, and Naive Bayes in predicting
    conception using artificial insemination. Borchers et al. [146] explored RF, linear
    discriminant, and NN for calving prediction in dairy cattle by examining their
    behaviour which includes number the of steps, lying time, standing time, transition
    from one state to other and total motion 14 days before the predicted calving
    date. Although, the innovative algorithms play a crucial role in livestock management
    but combining livestock data with public data will improve precision livestock
    farming standards [147]. Table 8 presents a comparative study of different ML
    algorithms for livestock production and management. TABLE 8 Different ML Algorithms
    for Livestock Production and Management F. Intelligent Harvesting Techniques Smart
    harvesting systems helps the farmers to harvest agriculture goods by reducing
    human efforts. In this approach, technologies such as smart sensors, robotics,
    UAVs, and IoT devices [148], AI, and ML-based computer vision techniques are employed
    to intelligently harvest the crops. The research community has provided a comprehensive
    review of different intelligent techniques used to automate the agriculture industry
    [149]–[151] and have analyzed the potential and challenges of this decision support
    system [152]. In the last few years, different robots have been developed for
    harvesting fruits and vegetables [153]. Smart harvesting offers better insight
    into the crops and helps farmers to achieve the potential harvest of crops which
    leads to increased productivity. Smart harvesting system has numerous advantages
    in comparison to traditional harvesting approaches like it requires less labour,
    optimized crop yield, maximum probability, better insight into crops, reduced
    cost of harvesting, and cost-efficient production. A significant problem in the
    Japanese agriculture industry is a labour shortage. Sakai et al. [154] utilized
    machine vision for asparagus robot harvesting in Nagasaki prefecture. The speed
    of asparagus robot harvesting is three times faster than the human being. Since
    asparagus harvesting is modeled on their size and doesn’t require color properties
    thus laser sensor is used to collect 3D distance information in the proposed work.
    Monta et al. [155] also explored laser sensors along with color cameras for tomato
    harvesting through robots. Preter et al. [156] developed an autonomous system
    consisting of e-vehicle, cameras, robotic arm, localization system, gripper, quality
    monitoring, and logistic handling system, which can efficiently detect, plucks,
    and puts the strawberries in a box. The proposed robot prototype is fast enough
    to pluck the fruit in just 4 seconds. Hayashi et al. [157] practically evaluated
    the performance of strawberry harvesting robots in a greenhouse test field. The
    proposed autonomous system efficiently access the fruit position and its maturity
    level and pick the fruit with and without suction in a duration of two to three
    weeks without damaging the fruit. Horng et al. [158] proposed a smart harvesting
    system that employs IoT and smart image recognition systems for the detection
    of mature crops using object detection feature trained on MLP neural network.
    The mature crop can be harvested using a robotic arm whose movement is predicted
    using ML algorithms. Zhang et al. [159] explored Regions-CNN (RCNN) for multi-class
    canopy object detection in shake and catch the apple harvesting system. A dataset
    of RGB images was created in the commercial orchard using a Kinect v2 sensor and
    pre-trained RCNN is utilized for real-time detection of apple, branches, and trunks.
    The authors also developed an estimation algorithm to predict shaking location
    based on the results of RCNN. Spectral and thermal images have also been explored
    for the detection of fruits and vegetables [160], [161]. Zhang et al. [162] investigated
    eleven canopy parameters using principal component analysis (PCA) and classified
    the removal status of apples into mechanically harvested and mechanically unharvested.
    Zhang et al. [163] reviewed technology progress in the mechanical harvesting of
    apples which includes shake and catch, robots, and harvest assist platforms. Pise
    and Upadhye [164] explored Naive Bayes and SVM ML techniques for grading of harvested
    mangoes based on their color, size, features, quality, and maturity. Grading of
    fruits increases the profit of the agriculture and food industries. A mango image
    dataset comprising of three different colors red, green, and yellow is created
    and is used for training and testing the ML algorithm. The proposed approach presents
    limited scope as it can detect defects in a particular surface area which can
    be overcome by creating a dataset of rotational view images. Wu et al. [165] explored
    NN for recognition, classification of fruits and vegetables, and obstacle avoidance
    in a harvesting robot. Table 9 presents a comparative study of different ML algorithms
    for intelligent harvesting. TABLE 9 Different ML Algorithms for Intelligent Harvesting
    SECTION V. IoT Applications in Precision Agriculture Precision agriculture refers
    to a system with minimizing direct involvement of the caretaker/farmer except
    when there is an urgent need or an emergency i.e. when there is a failure in the
    system. IoT helps in maintaining the defined standards of parameters needed for
    day to day work in agriculture. The parameters can be measured using the required
    sensors and can be uploaded to an IoT cloud for remote monitoring so that the
    direct involvement of farmers is minimized. The IoT cloud can be used for control
    purposes also, say for example in detecting and avoiding animal intrusion in the
    agriculture field. Sensors are an integral part of IoT for precision agriculture
    without which the monitoring and controlling becomes next to impossible task.
    Figure 6 shows the trend search of keywords “IoT in agriculture” and “sensor in
    agriculture” on google in the last 10 years. Apart from monitoring and controlling,
    IoT in agriculture is also used as data-storage technology. Parameters like properties
    of soil, crop yield, seasonal behaviour data, temperature changes, etc can be
    stored on the IoT cloud which will be helpful in analyses, prediction, and deciding
    on estimated crop production. FIGURE 6. Google trend response for keywords IoT
    in agriculture and sensor in agriculture for the last 10 years. Show All A. Sensors
    for IoT in Precision Agriculture IoT is defined as the interconnection of things,
    where one example of a thing is a sensor. A group of sensors can communicate with
    every other sensor and thereby with the control center. A WSN in IoT has the benefits
    of increasing the efficiency of production, enhancing the yield quality, detecting
    and avoiding plant-eating pets, detecting the fires in the farms [166]. IoT has
    helped in increasing the scope of farming, animal, and pet rearing along with
    smart irrigation [167]. Sensors form an integral part of IoT architecture in agriculture.
    A sensor is defined as a transducer that converts the sensed parameter (soil moisture,
    for example) into the equivalent electrical signal. Depending on the nature of
    the output signal they generate, sensors are classified as analog or digital sensors.
    An analog sensor’s output needs to be converted to digital before it is being
    fed, processed by any IoT system. On the other hand, sensors that generate signals
    in digital form can be directly connected to any IoT system. Table 10 compares
    the list of some important sensors applicable in precision agriculture. Addressing
    the complete list of sensors available for precision agriculture is beyond the
    scope of this article, although, table 10 provides the list of sensors and their
    parameters that are very widely used and covers almost every aspect of IoT in
    agriculture. A pair of sensors and actuators can be used to collect information
    about some of the vital parameters of precision agriculture and react to perform
    predefined action whenever required. IoT plays an important role in assuring that
    the action performed happens instantaneously with minimum delay. The factors that
    can affect the real-time decision making and causes a delay is the tolerance of
    the measuring parameter and the communication protocol used. The operating temperature
    where the sensors are placed have a proportional effect on tolerance. An increase
    temperature on either side will increase the tolerance of the measuring parameter
    and sensor reading will deviate the value of the measurand from the actual value.
    The communication protocol is used to send the readings of the sensor to the microcontroller
    from where the value will be uploaded to the IoT cloud. The data rate of communication
    protocol decides the time required for this data transfer. TABLE 10 Sensor Parameters
    Used in Precision Agriculture B. Wireless Sensor Networks in Precision Agriculture
    WSN is the collection of spatially displaced sensor deployed to monitor the physical
    parameters of the environment and coordinating the collected data at central location.
    IoT transfers the recorded data to cloud which is further processed and analyzed
    through intelligent algorithms. In precision agriculture integration of artificial
    intelligence with WSN allows real time monitoring and intelligent decision making
    in agriculture fields. IoT sensor network which includes soil moisture senor,
    electrochemical sensor, optical sensors, etc. continuously monitor the field data
    and works as a training data for ML and DL algorithms. Edge computing enabled
    AI systems assist in reducing the amount of data to be uploaded to IoT cloud by
    identification of meaningful data to be communicated and discarding the redundant
    data. Intelligent processing of data generated from nodes result in better management
    of sensor network In [185] author utilized AI driven sensor network to classify
    land as suitable, more suitable, moderately suitable and unsuitable after every
    cultivation. In [186] author developed a power efficient WSN using Arduino microcontroller
    and ZigBee module to monitor and control essential parameters that effect crop
    growth such as soil and weather conditions in Florida, USA. In [187] author integrating
    sensor nodes with AI systems to reduce the power consumption of nodes by optimizing
    the performance and data transmission of respective nodes. RNN based Long-Short
    term (LSTM) network was built which increases the runtime of a single sensor and
    guarantees 180 days autonomous operation using Li-ion battery. The proposed system
    continuously monitors the growth dynamics of plant leaves. In [188] author presents
    an autonomous system built with low power sensor nodes and IoT based cloud platform
    to estimate level of phosphorous in soil through ANN. Author incorporates dynamic
    power management system to maintain balance between energy consumption and estimation
    accuracy. In [189] author presents GA optimized WSN for precision agriculture
    applications. Thus, we conclude that integrating artificial intelligence with
    WSN, IoT plays a key role in assuring the best yield of crops. SECTION VI. Assessment
    and Evaluation of Knowledge-Based Agriculture System In this section ML algorithms
    used by different researchers in the precision agriculture system are analyzed.
    The agriculture industry is facing many challenges across the world, and a knowledge-based
    agriculture system allows sustainable use of resources by the farmers aiming to
    get maximum output from the agriculture land. There are two basic stages in precision
    agriculture, i.e. pre-processing stage and processing stage. In the pre-processing
    phase market trends are studied and based on geographical conditions and soil
    properties of the land seeds are selected and the land is prepared for precision
    agriculture system. In the post-processing stage machine vision techniques are
    explored for disease and weed identification while intelligent techniques are
    used for irrigation and harvesting. In this article, author reviewed and discussed
    70 articles where multiple ML algorithms are presented for performance optimization
    of the agricultural cycle. Figure 7 shows the classification of articles based
    on different applications of precision agriculture. FIGURE 7. Classification based
    on agriculture cycle. Show All Figure 8 depicts the cumulative distribution of
    the ML and DL models used by researchers in precision agriculture. The graph depicts
    the broad categorisation of the techniques with their applications to agricultural
    cycle. It has been observed that in majority of the literature the researchers
    have applied multiple algorithms for classification and parameter prediction.
    Regression models and ANN together make up around 65% of the AI techniques employed
    by researchers. Hence, it is important to investigate the techniques used and
    compared by the authors. The individual best performing algorithms have already
    been covered in appropriate sections, however the figure 8 depicts the distribution
    of the various regression algorithms and DL models throughout the literature.
    ELM algorithm is widely explored in prediction of soil properties such as soil
    moisture, soil temperature, surface humidity, ETc. ANN accurately predicts the
    rainfall and crop yield across different regions of globe. DL based CNN model
    finds wide applications for accurate disease and weed classification in agriculture
    crops. ANN model best predicts the nitrate content and water requirement in drip
    irrigation system. SVM regression model estimates the emitter outflow discharge
    under varying temperature and pressure conditions. Decision Tree algorithm accurately
    identify the chewing habits and predicts SCM in dairy herds. CNN have widely explored
    for livestock identification. Metaheuristic optimized ML algorithms are also explored

    employed as a support algorithms have been classified into others. FIGURE 10.
    Classification algorithm in precision agriculture. Show All A. Performance Comparison
    of ML Algorithms in Precision Agriculture The application of ML and DL algorithms
    highly depends on the agriculture cycle and the dataset involved. This section
    discusses the advantages and limitations of various ML and DL algorithms such
    as regression and classification algorithms based on the agriculture cycle involved.
    1) Soil Properties and Weather Prediction The application of AI techniques in
    prediction of soil parameters and weather is dependent on various factors. The
    researchers generally employ around 3 to 4 algorithms in for prediction and select
    the algorithms which has most accurate prediction and is robust to factors such
    as: noise, non-linearity, outliers etc. the most commonly employed algorithms
    are ELM, RF, SVR, and cubist algorithm. Advantages of using ML in prediction of
    soil properties and weather pattern: Non-linear dataset – these predictions often
    attributes a non-linear dataset which can be utilized for accurate prediction
    by regression algorithms such as: ELM, RF, SVR Large dataset – the dataset for
    is often obtained from satellite which can be well handled by the regression algorithms
    with less convergence time and accurate predictions. Insensitivity to outliers
    – Weather patterns often encounter outlier events which may affect the prediction
    accuracy, however algorithms such as ELM, NN are robust to outliers and provide
    accurate predictions. Accurate prediction – prediction of parameters using ML
    exhibit low error indices such as RMSE, and R2 which are standard measures of
    accuracy for statistical analysis. Challenges and limitations in prediction of
    soil properties and weather pattern: Varying geographical conditions poses a challenge
    for universal design of the prediction algorithms. Soil parameters prediction
    is highly dependent on the sample selection philosophy. Dataset selection and
    filtering is a challenge for researchers with non-computing background. 2) Crop
    Yield Prediction The application of AI techniques in prediction of crop yield
    is a mammoth task and lack of availability of a universal model makes designing
    of the algorithm challenging. The most promising algorithms for crop yield prediction
    are regression algorithms, and neural networks. Advantages of using ML in crop
    yield prediction: Complex dataset – crop yield prediction involves enormous dataset
    composing of satellite data and/or historic data. Faster and accurate predictions
    can be made by utilizing the AI techniques such as regression algorithms (SVR,
    RF) Neural networks (CNN). Parameter variation – the crop yield depends on a lot
    of parameters, like climatic factors, soil quality, NDVI, altitude, air parameters.
    The AI based prediction systems handle the parameters dependency efficiently.
    Accurate prediction – prediction of parameters using ML exhibit low error indices
    such as RMSE, and R2 which are standard measures of accuracy for statistical analysis.
    Challenges and limitations in prediction of crop yield: Varying parameters and
    complex datasets pose a challenge for universal design of the prediction algorithms.
    Dataset selection is critical due to the complexity; as an improper selection
    of data may result in underfit/overfit prediction pattern. 3) Disease and Weed
    Detection The applications of AI techniques in disease and weed detection primarily
    depends on the advances in image processing. CNN’s are the most prominent choice
    for building a disease identification system. Training dataset will govern the
    performance of the algorithm, although these are available in open-source format,
    users have to be cautious while using the dataset. Advantages of using ML in detection
    of weed and disease in a crop field: Prediction accuracy – AI offer accurate detection
    of disease and weeds with an accuracy of 99% which is better compared to manual/classical
    techniques. Robust prediction – the algorithms can predict the disease/weed even
    with smartphone images, which is commonly available with farmers. Easy configuration
    – with CNN being the most common and reliable technique, designing a disease/weed
    detection system is not a complex job unlike other systems discussed in text.
    Challenges and limitations in detection of weed and disease in a crop field: The
    accuracy of prediction depends on the quality of training dataset some of which
    is available as an open-source dataset, but is applicable to only a limited number
    of crops. Improperly labelled data may result in a disastrous prediction system,
    as the training of the system plays a major role in the performance of the system.
    Overtraining the model may result in a sensitive prediction system. 4) Drip Irrigation
    Smart irrigation systems are not only crop friendly but are environmental friendly
    too. The combination of IoT with the AI not only reduces the manual intervention
    but also utilizes the available in an optimum way to ensure no adverse effect
    to environment. Regression and Advantages of using ML in drip irrigation for an
    agricultural field: Optimum resource utilization – accurate estimation of irrigation
    requirements results in a system which optimizes the resource (water, electricity)
    utilization (NN algorithms). Crop protection – optimized irrigation practices
    minimizes water related damage to the crops and hence increases the crop yield.
    Robust to weather variations – an accurately designed AI based (Regression algorithms)
    irrigation system handles the random weather events in a better way when compared
    with the non-AI based irrigation methods. Challenges and limitations in drip irrigation
    for an agricultural field: Accurate prediction sometimes depends on the number
    of sensors and hence increases the initial investment of the farmers. An incorrect
    sensor placement in the filed affects the accuracy of the system, hence sensor
    optimization becomes imperative in designing a smart irrigation system. The architecture
    of prediction system highly depends on the dataset; hence no universal guidelines
    can be laid out for system design. 5) Livestock Production and Management The
    livestock management primarily focuses on the well-being of the farm animals and
    uses advanced image recognition (CNN) algorithms, and regression techniques to
    detect and predict the disease/ disease spread. Advantages of using ML in livestock
    production and management: Decreased risk of diseases – AI systems assists in
    identifying the livestock diseases and also helps in combating the disease, by
    predicting the root of diseases and transmission (Regression algorithms). Minimization
    of disease spread – timely diagnosis and treatment reduces the risk of spreading
    the disease. Psychological analysis – advanced image recognition and behavioural
    analysis (CNN techniques) help is detecting the stress in animals ensuring heath
    of the livestock. Challenges and limitations in drip irrigation for an agricultural
    field: With varying geographic and climatic conditions the attributes of the cattle
    and diseases changes hence, no universal system can be designed to cater to the
    diversities. Some viruses are difficult to predict even using the state-of-art
    prediction algorithms. 6) Intelligent Harvesting The applications of AI techniques
    in harvesting is primarily an assistive technology for automatic harvesting systems.
    Harvesting prediction system largely relies on the advances in image processing
    and CNN’s are the most prominent choice for building these systems. Advantages
    of using ML in intelligent harvesting: Assistive technology – AI in conjunction
    with existing harvesting robots exhibit high accuracy in harvesting. Image processing
    – the identification of harvesting relies on the state-of-art image processing
    algorithm (CNNs) and hence the developments in the image processing algorithms
    result in direct accuracy enhancement of intelligent harvesting techniques. Universal
    algorithms – the AI harvesting techniques largely depend on image recognition
    methods, hence CNNs can easily be deployed for implementing intelligent harvesting
    techniques. Challenges and limitations in intelligent harvesting: The accuracy
    of the prediction systems largely depends on the training dataset, hence accurately
    labelled dataset is a primary requirement of implementing an intelligent harvesting
    system. Inaccurate harvesting recognition system result in economic loss for farmers,
    as a delay in harvesting might lead to an overripe crop or early harvesting might
    lead to rejection of the product. SECTION VII. Challenges and Limitations of Artifical
    Intelligence in Precision Agriculture Artificial intelligence has the potential
    of playing an important role in meeting the food requirement of entire world.
    However, there are certain challenges which are hampering its adoption in agriculture
    industries which are outlined as follows: A recent government survey in India
    estimated that literacy rate of Indian farmers is very low therefore bridging
    the gap between farmers and technology is a challenging task. Farmers are less
    motivated to come out from their comfort zone and learn digital skills to improve
    their farming standards. Agriculture lands are mostly situated in rural areas.
    Implementation of IoT architecture and WSN which requires cloud services for data
    storage and analysis is a big issue in rural areas where reliable internet connectivity
    is not available. Accurate prediction and classification through cognitive ability
    of machines is difficult in varying geographical conditions. Initial set up of
    digital farming which includes hardware and software requires huge investment.
    Deployment of smart sensors and other electronic gadgets requires heavy energy
    consumption. SECTION VIII. Future Trends of Artifical Intelligence and IoT in
    Precision Agriculture Agriculture industry is globally US$5 trillion industry
    and now it has been revolutionized with artificial intelligence and IoT technologies.
    These innovative tools are assisting famers to improve crop yield, monitor soil
    parameters, livestock health and temperature conditions, control pests and improve
    other agriculture related tasks. Conventional ML and DL models such as SVM, RF,
    ANN finds difficult to accurately estimate soil parameters and weather conditions
    in varying ecosystem. Therefore, swarm intelligence optimized robust and adaptive
    ML and DL algorithms such as SVM-PSO, ANN-GWO algorithms can be explored to effectively
    forecast different parameters in precision agriculture. In large agriculture fields
    swarm intelligence inspired autonomous system can be built for crop health and
    growth monitoring. UAV swarm can be utilized for near real time field and livestock
    monitoring through computer vision and DL algorithms and accordingly swarm of
    UAV can be used for spraying of pesticides and fertilizers in the infected crops.
    Greenness of crops can be identified through UAVs installed cameras and an automated
    irrigation system can be built in large agriculture fields. Swarm of mobile robots
    can be used in the agriculture fields to efficiently automate task such as harvesting,
    weed identification and elimination, etc. Metaheuristic algorithms can be explored
    for nodes localization in agriculture fields in order to optimize the sensor deployment
    in the field and keep the minimize cost to farmers. Offline service chatbots can
    be built to assist farmers in developing countries where farmers don’t have good
    internet connectivity. These chatbots can assist farmers by providing timely advice
    based on expert recommendations and will help to resolve their specific farming
    problems. Artificial intelligence assisted renewable energy plants can be installed
    in agriculture lands to maximize the power output of clean energy in unpredictable
    weather conditions. This will allow for sustainable agricultural practices. Artificial
    intelligence can also be explored in vertical and soilless agriculture. In near
    future artificial intelligence systems, robotics and smart sensor technology will
    automate the whole farming process starting from seed sowing to intelligent fruits
    and vegetables harvesting and packaging. SECTION IX. Conclusion Precision agriculture
    is empowering the farmers with technology intending to get optimum outputs with
    precise inputs. IoT enabled smart sensors, actuators, satellite images, robots,
    drones are some of the key technological revolutions that boosted the agriculture
    industry. These components play a vital role in collecting real-time data and
    accordingly making decisions without human support. Artificial intelligence which
    is the automation of intelligent behaviour is continuously benefiting our planet
    and helping humans in various aspects of life. In this paper, authors have reviewed
    ML applications for precision agriculture. The impact of AI and IoT in smart farm
    management is discussed with a brief introduction to ML algorithms which are most
    commonly used in precision agriculture. Regression algorithms are the backbone
    for soil properties, weather, and crop yield prediction. DL algorithms such as
    CNN and ML classification algorithms such as SVM, Decision trees, and RF were
    explored for the identification of disease and weeds in the plants. Smart irrigation
    systems and harvesting techniques play an important component in precision agriculture
    as these techniques quickly complete the work and reduces human labour. Drones
    and robots enabled with a digital camera are employed for this work. Livestock
    management is an important concern for farmers across the world. Knowledge-based
    agriculture system which includes smart IoT devices and AI tools efficiently handle
    livestock management. As a scope of future work, NLP based chatbots can be built
    for famers and more ML, DL and hybrid algorithms can be explored in the agriculture
    industry for sustainable use of available resources. Authors Figures References

    Summary Although computerization has been enabling changes in the structure and
    economic geography of industries for decades, recent public discourse has become
    focused on a set of “new” advanced digital technologies and technology applications
    that appear poised to dramatically reduce demand for routine tasks and transform
    the organization and content of work. How are these changes shaping the strategic
    options for companies and policy-makers in less-developed economies? This paper
    disentangles the old and new features of the digital economy; distills three key
    business strategies underpinning its organization: modularity, open innovation,
    and platforms; and summarizes some of the benefits and risks for society. It explores
    the strategy and policy options available for firms and policy-makers in less
    developed places, with a focus on innovation and market positioning. Managerial
    Summary How is the digital economy shaping strategic options for managers in less-developed
    economies? This paper disentangles the old and new features of the digital economy
    and distills three key business strategies underpinning its organization: modularity,
    open innovation, and platforms. It then explores strategic options available for
    firms in less developed places, with a focus on innovation and market positioning.
    While core platform owners will have the capability and authority to accumulate,
    access, and analyze large pools of data, access to all of the world''s relevant
    data is not required to speed innovation or carve out new market space in the
    digital economy. The opportunities may be greatest in industrial applications,
    where the continued importance of physical systems and industry-specific domain
    knowledge drives adaptation and customization. 1 INTRODUCTION Recent public debate
    has become focused, with increasing frequency and urgency, on the imminent arrival
    of a “4th Industrial Revolution” which is said to be creating a “new” digital
    economy powered by advanced “cyber-physical” systems spanning “advanced” manufacturing,
    transportation, services, and even biological systems (Rose, 2016; Schwab, 2015,
    2016). The products and services commonly mentioned in connection to the digital
    economy can be divided into two main market segments: industrial and consumer,
    and into four cross-cutting, base technology areas: (a) new sources of data flowing
    via ubiquitous and often mobile internet connectivity, sometimes referred to as
    the internet of things (IoT), (b) cloud computing, (c) big data analytics, and
    (d) artificial intelligence (AI). In general, these advanced digital technologies
    could accelerate three ongoing trends in the organization, work content, and geography
    of industries: (a) the continued fine-slicing of activities into ever narrower
    and more specialized business functions, (b) the organization and spatial separation
    of deskilled or low-skill jobs from knowledge-intensive jobs; and (c) the automation
    of the low-skill tasks and/or their mobility to lower wage locations (Mudambi,
    2008). Simply put, a fundamental characteristic of global value chains (GVCs),
    the increasing spatial separation of innovation from production, could further
    accelerate. The idea that the digital economy will advance with great rapidity
    creates worry about dislocations, especially from rapid reductions in demand for
    labor-intensive and routine jobs from automation, autonomy, and artificial intelligence.
    Because they are far from core innovation regions (e.g., Silicon Valley and Southern
    Germany), firms and industries in low- and middle-income countries run the additional
    risk of rising technological dependency and further isolation and exclusion from
    high-value segments of these fast-moving and sometimes oligopolistic digital value
    chains. They may receive work, but experience an intensification “thin industrialization”
    (Whittaker et al., in press) because innovation remains in economies where core
    technology is developed while automation simultaneously decreases demand for unskilled
    labor. On the other hand, the technologies and platforms underpinning the digital
    economy hold great promise for increasing the productivity and global connectedness
    of consumers, workers, firms, and industries operating on the margins, and may
    be providing powerful new tools for accelerating innovation in the periphery as
    well. To help parse these opposite potentials, there is a need for an objective
    and concise description of the digital economy and the strategic options it offers
    firms and industries in less developed countries. The first half of the paper
    provides an overview of the main features of the digital economy. It identifies,
    in relatively simple and non-technical terms, its venerable and novel aspects
    and briefly summarizes some of the main features of the aforementioned market
    segments and technology areas. It also characterizes three key business models
    underpinning the organization of the digital economy (modularity, open innovation,
    and platforms), and introduces the key concept of platform layering. The second
    half of the paper asks how the new tools of the digital economy might be used
    for industrial upgrading in low- and middle-income countries, focusing on innovation
    and market positioning. The discussion is largely intended to inspire and help
    with the framing of near-term research on the uptake and impact of the digital
    economy in less developed economies. 2 WHAT IS THE DIGITAL ECONOMY? It is useful,
    and prudent, to place the digital economy in the context of changes that have
    been underway for several decades, including the arrival of mass market personal
    computers in the mid-1980s; the maturing of digital design tools, enterprise computing,
    and computerized manufacturing in the 1990s; the outsourcing and offshoring boom
    in the 2000s and the complex GVCs that resulted; and the improved operational
    fluidity that emerged along the way as multinational enterprises have sought to
    wrestle previously disparate and disconnected IT systems into some semblance of
    interoperability and coordination (Gereffi, Humphrey, & Sturgeon, 2005). The processes
    of digitization are most centrally rooted in computerization, which began in earnest
    in the 1960s with commercial mainframe computers. Since then, ongoing improvements
    in microelectronic hardware and software have vastly increased the capacities
    of information, computing and communications technology (ICT) while at the same
    time decreasing the cost, power consumption, and size requirements of hardware.
    This has already enabled the transformation of a wide range of products and processes.
    Mass access to portable computing and communications, global positioning, and
    the internet have all been facilitated by the rising power and falling costs of
    digital ICT.1 From the 1990s, the internet has underpinned, embodied and accelerated
    many of these trends, and it lies at the core of the digital economy as well.
    In other words, the “3rd industrial revolution,” based on stand-alone automation
    and digital ICT, is both enabling and embedded within the fourth. While progress
    in digital ICT has been rapid yet predictable in a log-linear sense,2 the adoption
    of new technologies has been more uneven. On one hand, updating technology systems
    in the midst of ongoing operations is a notoriously difficult task, akin to “changing
    a tire while the car is moving,” and this, along with traditional organizational
    resistance to altering routines and making large capital investments, renders
    any “technological revolution” fraught, partial, and sub-optimal in the aggregate.
    On the other hand, tipping points can be passed when enabling technologies suddenly
    open possibilities for vast streams of novel products and services. For example,
    because they aid in interpretation of visual data, the most powerful graphics
    processing semiconductors—mainly driven by gaming applications—have only recently
    opened up practical and affordable applications for machine learning-based AI.3
    With this background as context, a concise and somewhat stylized list of two main
    market domains and four cross-cutting, base technology areas driving the digital
    economy, along with some of their key features, are presented in Table 1, with
    fuller descriptions to follow. To state it plainly, a product or service can be
    considered as part of the “new” digital economy if it includes one or more of
    four base technology areas: large-scale data generation and aggregation, cloud
    computing, big data analytics, and artificial intelligence. For example, an assembly
    line with a robot cannot automatically be seen as part of the new digital economy,
    but an assembly line with a robot that is feeding data on its performance into
    the cloud can. TABLE 1. Market domains and cross-cutting, base technologies of
    the digital economy, with examples Market domains of the digital economy (applications)
    Industrial applications (advanced manufacturing/“industry 4.0”) Consumer applications
    (consumer platforms, products and services) Rising functionality and falling costs
    in advanced production equipment, including three-dimensional printers (3DP),
    intelligent robots and cobots, and drones Sensor-rich, connected machinery and
    infrastructure (IIoT), to collect large-scale data for use in intelligent and
    autonomous control systems and in enterprise and analytics software Advanced simulation

    small high-precision motors and actuators, and nano-manipulation Integration of
    the four technology areas listed below across product design, manufacturing, logistics,
    and customer relationship management Smart phones and other mobile devices Social

    and industry (IIoT) generated data flows from ubiquitous sensors and video monitoring,
    clickstreams, location data, “smart” products, and machinery, etc. Vertical and
    horizontal network connectivity within and across organizations and geographies

    analysis techniques Huge sample sizes leading to more robust results, new insights,
    and high fault tolerance 4. Artificial intelligence (AI) From neural networks
    to machine learning, autonomy, prediction, replication, and self-maintenance and
    regulation 2.1 Two application market domains: Industrial and consumer Like many
    markets, digital economy can be usefully broken down, most basically, into industrial
    and consumer application segments.4 On the consumer side, “smart” consumer-facing
    goods are increasing connected through the internet of things (IoT). The use of
    connected goods and services generate user data that allows platform owners and
    third parties to respond to and anticipate their needs, while analysis of aggregated
    data can be used for other profit-making activities such as targeted advertising.5
    The industrial side is sometimes referred to in terms of “advanced manufacturing,”
    or “Industry 4.0,” with descriptions that commonly mention AI-assisted design
    tools, sensor-laden and networked production machinery, and enterprise and supply
    chain integration systems that send data to the industrial internet of things
    (IIoT), where it can be analyzed, used to produce simulations, and acted upon
    to support productivity and quality improvements, better traceability, more timely
    maintenance, and real-time capacity planning and materials management. Industrial
    robots have been available for decades, but they have steadily become more intelligent,
    agile, and flexible. The mechanized mass production revolution of the early 20th
    Century brought in dedicated production equipment for repeated, large volume operations
    (Chandler, 1962). It was time-consuming and expensive to change what machines
    did, and the range of possible operations was severely limited. In the 1980s and
    1990s computer numerically controlled (CNC) production equipment arrived that
    could be programmed and re-programmed to increase product variety and perform
    a range of operations in three-dimensional space.6 Over time the capabilities
    of these stand-alone industrial robots and other CNC machinery have increased
    while costs have come down.7 Currently, relatively simple sensors and statistical
    process control algorithms can be employed to shut down or adjust production processes
    automatically when they move out of tolerance. However, with the rise in computing
    power and advent of low-cost sensor technology, it has become more operationally
    and economically feasible to share operational data within and even across factories
    and international borders in huge “data lakes.” With enough data, entire factories
    can be digitally simulated and machine learning algorithms can generate “predictive
    maintenance” solutions that aim to prevent processing errors or machine breakdowns
    before wear and tear of mechanical components or other predictable problems cross
    critical thresholds. As industrial robots become more agile and aware of their
    surroundings, they might work safely side by side with people to augment and assist
    workers, rather than replacing them (robots without such features tend to be dangerous
    and have traditionally operated within enclosed spaces on the factory floor).
    Such “cobots” can sometimes perceive human movements and automatically and intelligently
    adjust their movements and routines on the fly through machine learning (Hollinger,
    2016). Industrial robots are perhaps the most recognizable part of the “intelligent,
    or smart factory,” but advances in inventory control and automated guided vehicles
    (AGVs) are also contributing to productivity and quality improvements in factories.
    By combining image recognition and augmented reality (AR) technologies, workers
    can be trained in complex or variable assembly steps and receive real time input
    from an expert in another location able to remotely view what the operator or
    maintenance worker is seeing.8 2.2 Four cross-cutting, base technology areas of
    the digital economy 2.2.1 New sources of data and the internet of things Productivity
    improvements have long been based on collecting data, from Frederick Winslow Taylor''s
    time and motion studies of workers in the early 20th Century, to Japan''s “lean
    production” principles of continuous improvement and total quality management
    in the 1970s and 1980s, to the “Six Sigma” movement toward “zero defects” in the
    United States in the 1990s (Staley, 2019). Improvements come from measuring things,
    from the time it takes a worker to take a part from a bin, to the dimensions of
    a given part, to the number of defects coming from a specific supplier, to the
    relationship between air filtration levels or humidity and yields in a semiconductor
    fabrication clean room. As this list suggests, the art of measurement has become
    more sophisticated, from Taylor''s famous stopwatch, to cards on a kanban board
    signaling a need for more parts, to barcode readers that follow parts through
    a factory to allow traceability across the supply chain, to laser scanners and
    X-ray test equipment that check the tolerance of parts to the nanometer. Today,
    low-cost, low-power, and radio-frequency identification (RFID) sensor technologies
    are widening the scope for measurement and tracing in factories. Sensors can be
    embedded, not only in robots and production equipment, but in operator wearable
    devices, industrial vehicles, buildings, and pipelines. This is enabled by the
    falling cost of RFID tags that can continuously, periodically and automatically
    transmit data with very low power and bandwidth requirements. Since data can be
    collected on an on-going basis from multiple sources and in multiple points in
    the system, vast amounts of data can accumulate over time. Wireless transmission
    introduces new levels of flexibility in regard to where sensors are practical,
    allowing remote devices and systems to be located, networked, integrated, monitored,
    analyzed, and centrally controlled. Indeed, in addition to data collection, the
    remote control of machines and other systems is one of the main advantages of
    factory and operational systems that include the IIoT. These examples come from
    the industrial sector, and manufacturing has indeed been a main source of innovation
    for data-driven productivity improvement. But today, on-going digitization and
    the advent of the internet mean that data are gushing from every corner of society
    though the internet of things (IoT), not only from sensors built into production
    lines, but also from electric meters, security cameras, customer service call
    logs, mouse “clickstreams” from online activity, point-of-sale registers, social
    media “likes” and status updates, and voice commands given to mobile and stationary
    digital assistants. Indeed, core platform owners care less about profits from
    selling devices and more about collecting very detailed information about what
    users are interested in, what they buy, where they go, and what they do, so to
    gain the capability to push targeted marketing at the exact moment and place where
    users want and need to make purchasing decisions. An analog in industrial settings
    are dashboards where managers can monitor the performance of specific machines
    and workers from their desktop or mobile device in real time. 2.2.2 Cloud computing
    Prior to the widespread adoption of the personal computer, beginning in the early
    1980s, computers were accessed via “dumb” terminals consisting of only a monitor
    and a keyboard. All computing, including calculations and the programs that ran
    them, resided on centralized “mainframe” computers. Information storage was also
    centralized, first encoded on paper (punch cards) and later on magnetic and optical
    medium (tape and hard drives). With the advent of the personal computer, everything
    moved to the desktop: application software, processing (on a central chip or chip
    set), and storage (on floppy disks and hard drives). While cloud computing has
    echoes of computing''s past, it does not signal a simple return to centralization
    in computing architecture. The most significant difference from the 1970s mainframe
    era is that remote computing and storage are no longer centralized within enterprises,
    but can be distributed across the internet, accessible to anyone with authorization
    and the means to pay for access.9 Instead of downloading programs and installing
    them on PCs, web browsers have become the means of manipulating software and data
    that reside online. Computing infrastructure and storage space, applications,
    and platforms can be rented (usually according to a monthly subscription) and
    kept updated by the vendor. The shift of software as a product, purchased in physical
    form on a disk or as a download, to software-as-a-service (SaaS) and platform-as-a-services
    (PaaS), means that software is always available, from anywhere with a suitable
    Internet connection, and is always up-to-date. The same goes for computing infrastructure
    and storage (including for on-demand and streaming video services), access to
    which has rapidly shifted from the PCs and private networks to the public cloud.
    This is part of a broader “servicification,” or everything-as-a-service (EaaS)
    trend which includes not only software, but hardware devices and systems as well,
    such as personal computers, 3D printers, industrial robots, and solar energy systems
    that are owned, maintained, and updated by vendors and third parties. Many expect
    the demands on cloud-based systems to go up with increasing in data volume, especially
    from data-hungry applications such as video and virtual reality streaming to distant
    consumers; live streaming in applications such as social networking, experiential
    journalism and distance learning; and linking factories for centralized monitoring,
    control and data analysis (e.g., Miller, 2018). Bandwidth limitations have created
    latency issues, especially across great distances and in places with ICT infrastructure
    is poor, that has driving momentum to add “edge computing” to the cloud by placing
    additional data storage and computing resources (applications) close to users.
    By enabling faster, more reliable and more secure data access far from the central
    nodes of the internet,10 edge computing could speed the adoption of advanced solutions
    such as AI, virtual reality, and connected manufacturing in less developed countries,
    without foregoing all of the advantages of centralization, such as synchronization
    and large-scale data analytics. When combined with 5G cellular networks, which
    promises to bring very high data rates the “last mile” to mobile users, the decentralized
    character of computing could proceed even further. Once again, the decentralization
    associated with edge computing and 5G does not represent a simple return to decentralization,
    but a method for overcoming bandwidth bottlenecks in pursuit of the secular trend
    in computing toward greater geographic coverage, resiliency, ubiquity, and performance.
    While data integrity and security are obvious risks, the cloud offers great promise
    as a place where data can be collected and analyzed in vast quantities. This promise
    is heightened by the ever-increasing flow of new data entering various clouds
    each day. The question of how to make use of cloud-based data is answered, in
    part, by the field of data science, or big data analytics. 2.2.3 Big data analytics
    and AI The cloud is more than a place to store data and run SaaS programs. It
    is a receptacle for the huge volumes of data flowing in the IoT. If sensors and
    devices feed enough data into the cloud, duly tagged with fine-grained metadata
    (about its source, location, etc.), they can be “mined” for insights that enable
    “data-driven decision making” by businesses, government agencies, and any person
    or organization with access to the data and the means to carry out further analysis.
    This is not simple or easy, since large sample sizes increase the robustness of
    analysis, but also introduce risks. One of the central challenges of analyzing
    big data is to develop methods for screening out the “noise” from poor data quality
    (including incorrect metadata tags) and weighting and interpreting data from different
    sources and of different kinds.11 If the cloud allows the accumulation of vast
    quantities, or “lakes” of data, and analytics leads to a deeper understanding
    about the sources of data (human and machine) and social and business contexts
    they inhabit, then AI, or machine-learning algorithms, can begin to make “predictions
    and decisions in an increasingly automated way, and at large scale” (Brynjolfsson,
    2016). AI technologies have been publicly available, often open sourced and for
    free, since 2008, but have been too slow and unstable to come into mainstream
    use until very recently.12 Advances in microelectronics, especially very powerful
    graphic processing chips (GPUs), mean that large pools of data can now be analyzed
    and mathematically represented in graphic matrices, allowing machine learning
    to be carried out without deep domain knowledge of how objects are being incorporated
    in the model. The current excitement (and worry) about AI is coming from its gradual
    move beyond “supervised machine learning,” where humans tag images and other data
    and define the “right” solution in advance (which mainly creates an appearance
    of machine intelligence) to “unsupervised machine learning,” where the no solution
    is defined a priori and machines are able to classify unlabeled data on the fly,
    allowing results to be obtained and system performance to improve without human
    intervention (Mar, 2017). There are real and potential benefits from big data
    analytics and AI, both for society and business strategy. In the realms of public
    health, social science, marketing, and innovation, we are seeing new possibilities
    emerging for “crowd-sourced” insights, such as tracking the timing and location
    of disease outbreaks though real-time analysis of public search terms (McAfee
    & Brynjolfsson, 2016; McAfee and Brynjolfsson, 2017). Reliance on user reviews
    is a central feature of a range of online retail businesses, from e-commerce travel
    services sites.13 While use of data for targeted marketing or improving operational
    performance is not new, McAfee and Brynjolfsson (2016) identify three new aspects
    of big data: volume, velocity, and variety. Because it is scalable and always
    available and accessible, the cloud is allowing businesses to accumulate unprecedented
    volumes of data, available in near real time, in a wide variety of forms (written,
    numerical, audio-visual). Volume and variety can increase accuracy of analysis
    (e.g. the “wisdom of the crowd,”) and high velocity improves responsiveness and
    relevance.14 There are also real and potential risks, especially from the aggregation
    of personal and consumer data for the purposes of segmenting the quality of customer
    service, price discrimination, and social control. Customer lifetime value (CLV)
    scores refer to rankings surreptitiously used by companies to gauge the potential
    long-term financial value of customers: those with low scores are not offered
    discounts or can wait longer for customer service, for example (Safdar, 2018).
    Big data and AI can also enable “first degree” price discrimination, where prices
    are adjusted in real time based on a consumer''s perceived need for a product
    or service and willingness to pay, estimated from prior shopping and purchasing
    histories analyzed in the context of millions of prior purchases from shoppers
    with similar habits (Shiller, 2014). Indeed, automated-decision making, data mining,
    and predictive analytics is widely used in ways that discriminate against the
    poor (Eubanks, 2017). Similarly, using images from cameras located on streets
    and in other public spaces, authorities can use a combination of big data and
    AI to almost instantaneously identify individuals from their faces, gaits, and
    other characteristics for the purposes of public safety—and social control. While
    many public spaces are currently surveilled in this way, and there are arguably
    justifiable benefits from the use of such systems in some contexts (e.g., airport
    security), there are obvious risks in the broader realms of privacy and opportunities
    for democratic association. On this front, Chinese officialdom''s use of big data
    and AI by to identify individuals—in only a few seconds through a network of nearly
    400 million cameras—has received the most critical attention,15 but in the United
    States, too, the 2000s saw emerging platform companies and state intelligence
    agencies using big data about consumers and citizens to create what Zuboff (2019)
    calls “surveillance capitalism”.16 2.2.4 Three business models To sum up the previous
    section, new sources of data, from smart phones to factory sensors, are sending
    vast quantities of data into the “cloud,” where they can be analyzed to generate
    new insights, products, and services and provide the large-scale data necessary
    for meaningful machine learning. But technology is not the only driver of the
    digital economy. It is centrally characterized by a set of business models that
    seek to cope with—and profit from—the growing complexity of systems based on digital
    ICT. There is no way any one organization can fully understand or control the
    underlying technologies of the digital economy, or its applications. Systems must
    be designed to dynamically cope with immense and growing complexity without breaking
    down. Accordingly, strategies in the digital economy have come to rely on: (a)
    partitioning of technologies and system elements in self-contained, manageable,
    affordable, yet interoperable modular segments and components, (b) external and
    even communally held sources of knowledge and technology that can support open
    innovation, and (c) platform competition, where distinct platforms—some with associated
    third party ecosystems offering complementary products and services—can offer
    new business opportunities and competitive spaces but sometimes layer over or
    even displace existing industries and traditional firm versus firm competition
    (Ezrchi & Stucke, 2016). In other words, business models in the digital economy
    typically include modularity, open innovation, and platforms as strategic elements.
    2.2.5 Modularity Modularity helps to support business models based on interchangeability,
    where discrete functional elements can be added or subtracted without redesigning
    entire systems (Baldwin & Clark, 2000; McDermott, Mudambi, & Parente, 2013). Because
    the input/output protocols that link system elements are known a priori, elements
    in modular systems can be designed without full knowledge of system architecture
    or the internal workings of other system elements (Ulrich, 1995). MacDuffie (2013)
    broadened the strategic significance of modularity by highlighting three of its
    aspects: as a property (in the design of products and systems), as a process (in
    operations) and as a (normative) frame. In product design, off-the-shelf or lightly
    customized modular components and sub-systems can be designed-in or substituted
    as elements of larger systems as long as suppliers and other third parties have
    the information they need about the interface to provide compatible components
    and services. On the factory floor, different machines, tools, and subassemblies
    with common interfaces and control systems can be substituted for one another,
    or be easily fitted with compatible attachments and fixtures. When combined with
    design modularity, compatible components, and subsystems can be substituted on
    the same line, driving up product diversity with, at most, superficial changes
    to the process. While the advantages of design and process modularity in regard
    to conservation of design effort (reuse of modules), flexibility, and capacity
    utilization are obvious enough, MacDuffie documents how the practice, while successful
    in industries where systems and processes could be robustly codified, failed in
    industries where industry-level standards were poor or slow to develop for technical
    or institutional reasons (Sturgeon et al., 2008; Whitney, 1996). Missing from
    MacDuffie''s three aspects of modularity was a fourth: value chain modularity,
    which has been an important focus of GVC scholarship (Gereffi et al., 2005; Sturgeon,
    2002). Value chain modularity arises when complex information about products,
    production, logistics, and other requirements, can—because they are based on widely
    known standards and protocols—be easily exchanged across organizational and geographic
    boundaries. In this way value chain modularity enabled a trend toward outsourcing
    and offshoring by easing suppler switching and aiding in the coordination of spatially
    dispersed industries.17 Figure 1 provides a stylized depiction of how value chain
    modularity can emerge within a firm, become standardized, spread to an industry,
    and eventually underpin the development of GVCs. The top arrow depicts work flow
    in an integrated firm (Stage 0). Work is carried out in teams or departments (ovals),
    and tasks are completed and coordinated across teams on the basis of tacit knowledge
    exchange (roundtables where ovals meet). There is no set format for the output
    of each team''s work, nor for handing the completed task off to the next team
    or department. The two teams meet, usually in-person, to enable the next phase
    of work to be carried out, and so on until the project or product is complete.
    While this can be the only way to work if the content of tasks are novel, highly
    complex, or otherwise necessarily based on tacit knowledge, it can be very slow
    and unproductive, and managers commonly search for ways to streamline the flow
    of work across stages of value added.18 FIGURE 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint
    Stages of value chain modularity and the emergence of GVCs. Source: Adapted by
    author from UNCTAD (2017) When it is possible for tasks to be routinized and codified,
    companies typically seek to standardize the output format of work (hexagon representing
    more codified linkage where information is exchanged in Stage 1). Once this proprietary
    standard is stable, lead firms tend to seek external suppliers to lower costs,
    increase flexibility, and free up internal personnel for higher-value work (Gawer
    & Cusumano, 2014). Lead firms with a great deal of purchasing power can demand
    that suppliers adhere to their proprietary methods for exchanging information
    in transactions. Broad use of external suppliers in an industry, and the emergence
    of third party vendors supplying software that formalizes transactions, can lead
    to de facto or de jure industry standard methods for exchanging information across
    a value chain (Stage 2). Industry standards can be driven by industry-dominant
    lead firms, by highly successful ICT vendors, by suppliers seeking to standardize
    how they interact with large customers, or in the case of de jure standards, consortiums
    that include some or all these stakeholders. Theoretically, industry-wide value
    chain modularity has the potential to decrease the contractual and operational
    frictions that come with organizational and geographic distance, therefore increasing
    the potential for outsourcing and offshoring in GVCs (Stage 3). Put concisely,
    value chain modularity involves the systematic partitioning of formerly tacit
    information and the development of proprietary standards for exchanging information
    within a firm to increase efficiency (intra-firm modularity), and across firm
    boundaries when combined with industry standards for exchanging information (value
    chain modularity), and also across geographic boundaries, enabling both outsourcing
    and offshoring through the use of modular type linkages in GVCs (Dossani & Kenney,
    2003; Gereffi et al., 2005; Sturgeon, 2002). Of course, the stages depicted in
    Figure 1 can be—and regularly are—reversed or restarted (though rarely in a thoroughgoing
    manner), putting pressure on firms to consider strategies of vertical (re)integration
    and/or reshoring. Cano-Kollmann et al. (2016, p. 258) describe a co-evolutionary
    process where de-codification re-starts the process of modularization when radically
    new technologies or system elements are introduced, while at the same time leaving
    still-relevant standards and protocols in place. This sort of accretion and layering
    of standards and thick modularity is a defining feature of the digital economy.
    The central point is that modularity will be further enabled—and likely accelerated—by
    the technologies, tools, and platform ecosystems of the digital economy. This
    is because interoperability and known (and increasingly open) standards are critical
    to its functioning, and because platform structures are generally modular, offering
    specific functionality linked across standardized, or at least very well defined,
    input and output interfaces. All this allows platform designers, complementors,
    and users to add, subtract, and update specific functions within digital ecosystems
    on the fly. This may serve to lower barriers to network entry for firms that know
    and have the capabilities to conform to the standards, even firms that are distant
    from markets and business partners. 2.2.6 Open innovation Open innovation refers
    to the pre-competitive pooling of R&D activities, design criteria, and software
    code, either through consortia or though the voluntary “crowdsourcing” efforts
    of engineers and technologists interested in creating free resources for their
    communities (Chesbrough, Vanhaverbeke, & West, 2006).19 For example, nearly all
    the world''s major computer programming languages are open sourced and available
    for free. Other examples include open sourced designs for server farms and publicly
    accessible training databases of coded images and basic algorithms for machine
    learning.20 Like modularity, open innovation helps companies “vertically specialize,”
    that is, develop a strategic focus on a core bundle of competencies, while still
    providing customers with a rich set of fully functional products and solutions.
    Open innovations are by definition widely available and free, including to firms
    and researchers in less developed economies. However, they are rarely used on
    their own. They are commonly adapted for specific applications and combined with
    additional open and proprietary technology resources to create what often become
    proprietary systems. 2.2.7 Platforms The digital economy is, and will likely continue
    to be, characterized by a set of (more or less) interoperable technology and product
    platform ecosystems (Kenney & Zysman, 2016; Parker, Van, & Choudary, 2016). Platforms
    gain their power from “network effects” where the utility of the platform increases
    along with the number of users and customers. They tend to be affordable (or free)
    for users because platform owners benefit in one way or another from aggregating
    user data, or by collecting modest fees. Network effects sometimes extend to third
    party complementors offering compatible products, services, or modules to run
    within or over the platform. Because of this, competition between dominant platforms
    can sometimes resemble more venerable competitive models where large firms, along
    with their affiliated and closely-related suppliers, compete for customers in
    end markets. However, the centrality of software and thoroughgoing modularity
    in the digital economy mean that successful platforms are more easily scalable,
    and thus able to create huge network effects quite suddenly, leading quickly to
    winner-take-most, oligopolistic market outcomes, at least in consumer markets
    where user wants and needs tend to be similar. Most large platform owners already
    have the IoT, cloud computing, big data analytics, and AI at the center of their
    business models.21 Each of these business models—modularity, open innovation,
    and platforms—are present in each of the main technology areas in Table 1, as
    depicted in Figure 2. For example, IoT wireless transmission is typically achieved
    using open source or third party protocols.22 Cloud computing services are often
    built from modular “containers” that perform specific functions within specific
    clouds, and a given cloud often serves as a platform upon which additional modules,
    such as data analytics and AI services, can be developed, modified, integrated,
    and distributed to users.23 By extension, all applications in the digital economy
    are likely to include one or more of its characteristic business models. For example,
    advanced manufacturing systems are mainly comprised of modular components and
    machinery, benefit from open innovation inputs, and can act as platforms upon
    which third party complementors can offer specific fixtures and tools.24 The fact
    that the offerings of mobile computing, social media, e-commerce, and internet
    services companies are based on platforms that connect users and third party vendors
    is obvious enough. FIGURE 2 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Business models and
    cross-cutting, base technologies in the digital economy 2.2.8 Platform layering
    While Figure 2 depicts the digital economy as having a unitary structure, each
    technology area in fact features competing sets of nested platforms that rely
    on a dynamic mix of shared and dedicated modular platform complementors, as depicted
    in Figure 3 (Thun & Sturgeon, 2019). Because high complexity is combined with
    the need for interoperability, the digital economy has developed as a set of nested
    modules and platforms based on a mix of de jure and de facto standards. At a more
    foundational level, technology platforms offer discrete functional elements (such
    as chipsets and programming languages), upon which core platforms can be developed
    to provide higher-level functionality (e.g., standardized hardware systems, and
    software environments).25 Above these, higher-level platforms can connect users
    and buyers to suppliers and vendors of goods and services across “two-sided” platforms
    (Eisenmann, Parker, & Van Alstyne, 2006).26 Such higher-level platforms can support
    additional platform layers, and because modular system elements can be altered
    and upgraded without redesigning entire systems, there is no obvious limit to
    the depth and complexity of the digital economy. FIGURE 3 Open in figure viewer
    PowerPoint Platform layering as a value chain in the digital economy. Source:
    Adapted by author from UNCTAD (2017) The result are vast ecosystems of shifting,
    overlapping, and nested platforms consisting of multiple layers (with different
    owners) each with its own standards, industrial or consumer users, and two-sided
    markets. The flow of value addition across layers bears some resemblance to a
    traditional linear value-added chain (see left side of Figure 3).27 Within layers,
    each two-sided market can likewise be conceived in more traditional terms: as
    a “pipeline” running from the producers of products and services to end users
    via an intermediary: the platform, which sometimes charges a fee similar to a
    mark-up charged by retailers in traditional value chains. The main difference—along
    with a high degree of interoperability across layers (despite very high complexity)
    and the ability of platform owners to monetize data about buyers and sellers—is
    the software-based character of digital platforms, which enables the easy scalability
    of successful platforms and sometimes, their emergence as dominant players in
    short order based on very strong network effects. From a geographic point of view,
    the development of technology and core platforms has so far tended to be highly
    concentrated in a few technology regions such as Silicon Valley, Seattle, and
    Southern Germany. By contrast, the development of higher-level platforms tends
    to be more fragmented and closely tied to local market characteristics and institutional
    conditions. As a result, the main opportunities for companies tend to come at
    higher platform layers and be somewhat narrower in less developed countries (see
    right side of Figure 3). 3 UPGRADING STRATEGIES FOR THE DIGITAL ECONOMY What are
    the best strategies for companies in less developed economies seeking to leverage
    the tools of the digital economy and to compete and prosper in its markets? What
    should be the focus for the policy-makers, university departments, and vocational
    training organizations that support them? While more research in countries across
    the spectrum of development, available skills, and institutional capacity will
    be required before these questions can be answered with any depth, nuance, or
    confidence, four tentative focus areas are offered in this section as logical
    outgrowths of the prior discussion: third party complimenting and higher-level
    platform competition, industrial rather than consumer application markets, and
    platform innovation. The section concludes by highlighting the risks of geographic
    data partitioning, which could continue to sever less developed places from the
    most innovative and high-value segments of the digital economy. 3.1 Focus on 3rd
    party complimenting and higher-level platform competition The layered platform
    structure of the digital economy provides multiple points of entry for third party
    platform complementors, which can sell discrete modules, products, and services
    compatible with one or more platforms. It also as opens up opportunities for companies
    to build higher-level platforms on top of lower-level platforms (e.g., solutions
    running on lower-level platforms or mini-apps that run on super-apps).28 Because
    compatible complements and platforms are essentially modules with well-known interfaces,29
    both of these approaches could be attractive for companies located far from the
    core technology regions of the digital economy. The key is knowing the requirements
    and having the capability and market knowledge needed to offer complementary or
    higher-level products and services. When information and skills gaps exist, government
    policy and education and training institutions can help to fill them. 3.2 Focus
    on industrial applications30 An important difference between the industrial and
    consumer sides of the digital economy is that consumer-facing businesses can challenge
    the primacy of traditional products and services because they can, like all software-based
    products, be replicated and scaled independently of physical products.31 The addition
    of new buyers and sellers is not encumbered by the detailed characteristics of
    the products and services it links customers to. As such, consumer-facing platforms
    can sometimes grow from zero to billions of dollars of revenue, generate winner-take-most
    network effects, and become globally dominant very quickly. The industrial side
    of the digital economy is different because the physical characteristics of materials,
    products, and systems typically introduce scalability limits that constrain some
    system elements. For example, an industrial analytics platform is unlikely to
    scale independently from the products and processes it is meant to improve. It
    may provide new insights, increase productivity, and enabling better decision-making
    through big data analysis and AI, but its value lies in its ability to take the
    physical characteristics of outputs, productive assets and inputs into account.
    These production and operational characteristics vary for all but the most standardized
    products. We see industrial analytics vendors offering a host of generic, industry-specific,
    and customized data analytics platforms,32 and although there are attempts to
    scale these platforms to generate large network effects (Stallkamp & Schotter,
    2019), industry and process specificity appear to be driving continued market
    fragmentation in the IIoT. Production equipment, even with the flexibility enabled
    by advanced digital features, is still less flexible and generic than the physical
    assets needed to scale software-based consumer products and services, such as
    server farms and fulfillment warehouses for e-commerce, which are largely generic.
    While AI-enabled analysis of big data may allow producers to simulate and reorganize
    the physical configuration of a plant and guide the optimal use of its physical
    assets (making IIOT very valuable), this does not (yet) allow the physical elements
    of cyber-physical systems to be fully freed from scale constraints. Consumer needs,
    by contrast, are more similar (Economist, 2016). In addition, while industrial
    companies actively seek to avoid lock-in to any single technology vendor, individual
    consumers have little incentive to work simultaneously across multiple platforms.
    Because they remain linked to the specific characteristics of what they are processing,
    the delivery of industrial systems and services is more likely to require customization
    and system integration based on significant industry- and even firm-specific domain
    knowledge.33 Thus, the industrial side of the digital economy is likely to remain
    more fragmented, while the consumer side, without strong intervention from state
    regulators, is likely to continue to be populated by mega-scale platforms that
    enjoy the largest network effects and economies of scale. For strategy and policy
    in less developed countries, it is clear that most country-scale digital markets
    do not have the size to generate the network effects needed to compete with global-scale
    consumer platforms. Striving to replicate or replace dominant global players with
    domestic versions is possible, but is likely to require regulatory intervention,
    and could lees to sub-optimal services. However, entry barriers may be significantly
    lower on the industrial side. With network effects limited by the specifics of
    products, processes, and materials, there may be many more niches for small or
    remote companies to provide specialized, industry-specific products, services
    and applications. Market entry can be eased by the ready availability of open
    source technology resources, and the possibility of leveraging (if for a fee or
    in return for access to data) the capabilities technology, core, and higher-level
    platforms. Furthermore, the requirement for customization is likely to heighten
    the importance of proximity to users. Therefore, it may be prudent to focus on
    the industrial side of the digital economy, where network effects are weaker,
    while allowing consumers to benefit from the hyperscale network effects of mega-platforms.34
    3.3 Focus on platform innovation Since the technological capabilities and market
    knowledge needed to drive innovation can be lacking in places that occupy production
    and assembly roles in global value chains, due to “thin industrialization” (Whittaker
    et al, forthcoming), it is useful to ask how smaller companies and firms in less
    developed countries might take advantage of the digital economy for innovation.
    The breadth and richness of digital tools supporting innovation in the digital
    economy is suggested by Figure 4, which provides some examples of the services,
    tools, and technology resources small and remote firms might encounter on-line.
    These run the gamut from accessing capital, to labor, training inputs, and technical
    assistance, to operational inputs and services, to highly efficient methods for
    providing customer service and creating scalable and far-reaching sales channels,
    logistics, and marketing campaigns. Local versions of these tools, services, and
    platforms exist in many countries, and global versions are also in wide use. Given
    this toolkit, the potential of the digital economy for innovation and entrepreneurship
    in less developed countries can be seen as profound. FIGURE 4 Open in figure viewer
    PowerPoint Examples of tools for the emerging innovation ecosystem in the digital
    economy. Source: Adapted by author from UNCTAD, 2017 Take the example of product
    design. Even when using today''s digital tools, product design requires many engineering
    hours and multiple rounds of validation and testing. Failed tests lead to engineering
    changes and many additional hours of redesign and retest. At a certain point,
    designs that work “well enough” might be accepted because sunk time and expense
    threaten to become excessive. This can lead to high costs, long cycle times, and
    sub-optimal results. Digital design simulation has been around for several decades,
    moving from easier-to-model applications like automated circuit and software testing
    into more challenging applications such as simulation of mechanical and natural
    systems (e.g., 3D modeling, fluid dynamics, power transmission in drive trains
    and aviation systems). However, advanced digital design tools are improving capabilities
    for automatically generating multiple design options, investigating the cost and
    supply-chain availability of components, and integrating with automated production
    equipment anywhere in the world—either in existing manufacturing clusters, close
    to consumption, or adjacent to innovation. With such capabilities in place, the
    work hours needed to create new products could fall sharply, along with the expertise
    needed to design and produce high quality products and components. Once design
    engineers codify constraints and enter them into the software, generative design
    tools can offer up or simulate multiple solutions. With complex programming or
    heavy engineering requirements satisfied by software, product designers might
    come to rely more on their subjective, artistic judgment, and those of others
    (e.g. focus groups, opinions collected via social media), rather than primarily
    on technical skills. Evaluating potential designs in rich 3D using augmented or
    virtual reality (AR or VR) is also becoming more common and less expensive (Barbier,
    2017). In sum, the new design and simulation tools emerging in the digital economy
    could present opportunities in less developed countries where high-level technical
    skills might be lacking, but knowledge of local market preferences is great. Participating
    in digital GVCs and engaging in platform innovation, is, again, a matter of knowing
    the standards and meeting the requirements of modular interfaces, which suggests
    that useful policies could focus on filling information gaps, providing appropriate
    training, reducing import costs for technology, core and lower-level platforms,
    and perhaps offering subsidies or incentives for acquiring licenses for technology
    areas related to the digital economy. Training and education in the four base
    technology areas of the digital economy seen in the lower portion of Table 1 will
    be critically important, though these programs might also benefit from leveraging
    global on-line education and free resources from open innovation repositories.
    Beyond that, the focus could be on ensuring that consumers have control over and
    are appropriately compensated for use of their personal data, and on policing
    abuses by platform owners and nefarious third parties. 3.4 Data partitioning,
    a new digital divide? Access to data is likely to remain partitioned in the digital
    economy. A stylized depiction of data flows across platform layers, shown in Figure
    5, suggests that the sweet spot for control over big data resides with core platform
    owners, and secondarily with higher-level platforms. While, access to data is
    contested in practice, and technology licensing contracts often specify limits
    to data access and flows across digital supply chains, especially in industrial
    markets, access to larger insights from larger pools of data will either come
    with a cost or be entirely the purview of core platform and at higher levels,
    mega-platform owners. FIGURE 5 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Actors, data access,
    and data flows in the digital economy. Source: Adapted by author from UNCTAD,
    2017 As a result, the “digital divide” could increasingly describe not only the
    difference between those that are connected to the digital world and those that
    remain disconnected, or those with “digital readiness skills” and those without
    them, but also widening inequality within groups and places that are connected.
    More people and places will be connected to the digital economy, and might benefit
    from it, but it is entirely possible that the levers of control and the extraction
    of profits will lie in the hands of only a few, mirroring dynamics in GVCs where
    lead firms (brands and retailers) have been able to extract more profit than all
    but the most dominant technology suppliers (Linden, Kraemer, & Dedrick, 2009),
    and where “global suppliers” have in some industries crowded out domestic supplies
    (Sturgeon & Lester, 2004). Thus, the role of policy is critical. Policy makers
    have an obligation to shape digital technologies in ways that protect citizens
    and key institutions from abuse or damage and mitigate market concentration. As
    MIT President Rafael Reif put it, “Fortunately, the harsh societal consequences
    that concern us all are not inevitable. Technologies embody the values of those
    who make them, and the policies we build around them can profoundly shape their
    impact. Whether the outcome is inclusive or exclusive, fair or laissez-faire,
    is therefore up to all of us” (Dizikes, 2019). However, since most advanced digital
    technologies are not “made” in less developed countries, we have to acknowledge
    that the opportunities for such shaping can be limited. 4 CONCLUDING REMARKS The
    main driver of the digital economy is the continued exponential improvement in
    the cost-performance of ICTs, mainly microelectronics, following Moore''s Law.
    This is not new. The digitization of design, advanced manufacturing and robotics,
    communications, and distributed computer networking (e.g., the internet) have
    been altering the processes of innovation and the possibilities relocation of
    work for many decades. However, there are three trends within the digital economy
    that are relatively novel. First, there are new sources of data, from smart phones
    to factory sensors, resulting in the accumulation of vast quantities of data in
    the “cloud,” and creating information “lakes” that can be mined for new insights,
    products, services—and create new risks to society (e.g. social control through
    mass surveillance). Second, business models based on modular and sometimes open
    technology and product platforms—platform innovation, platform ownership, and
    platform complimenting—are, in a range of industries and product areas, accelerating
    ongoing changes in industry structure and, in some instances, radically altering
    the terms of competition. Third, the quantitative advancement in semiconductor
    technology described in Moore''s Law has, in some areas, especially graphics processing,
    advanced to the point where qualitative changes have begun to occur in the practical
    applications for machine learning-based AI. What these novel trends share is reliance
    on very advanced ICT. Being transformational, the digital economy will likely
    create both winners and losers, opportunities and risks. For large companies,
    organizations, and governments, we have already seen the vulnerability—to hacking,
    identity theft, espionage, larceny, ransoming, and industrial sabotage—that come
    with connecting private communications, industrial systems, and public infrastructure
    to the internet (Hampson & Jardine, 2016). As a result, some of the companies
    most deeply engaged in advanced digital manufacturing currently do not dare to
    make connections outside the immediate premises of their factories for fear of
    data breaches, and this obviates the advantages that might come with data sharing
    and pooling across the larger organization and supply-bases. Ignoring such risks
    can have grave consequences, while taking them seriously can undermine the promised
    benefits of the digital economy. For smaller companies, the cost and expertise
    required to purchase, operate, and continually upgrade advanced digital systems
    may drive a larger wedge between the large—and mainly multinational—firms with
    the scale to justify the needed investments, and smaller, locally-oriented and
    firms in less developed countries. Nevertheless, the layered and modular character
    of the digital economy could continue to enable the fine slicing and relocation
    of value chains, opening up opportunities for participating in digital GVCs. It
    is an intriguing prospect, from a less developed country perspective, that small
    firms and entrepreneurial start-ups, anywhere, might have access to crowd funding
    and build products based on technology, core, and higher-level platforms, for
    example. Large and small companies, in rich and poor countries alike, can increasingly
    rely of the new, and often low-cost or free tools of the digital economy to make
    their organizations more efficient, reach and serve customers more effectively,
    speed new product development, and created highly tailored products and services
    without the need for deep domain- or system-level expertise. With AI-assisted
    tools built into design software, and data analytics included as a feature of
    in platforms to help refine subsequent design iterations, platform innovation
    could become more affordable, efficient, and effective. While core platform owners
    might have access to more comprehensive data than higher-level platform owners
    or end users, access to all of the world''s relevant data is not required to speed
    innovation or carve out new market space in the digital economy. The eventual
    shape and impact of the digital economy is unknowable and likely unimaginable.
    Much will depend on the pace of change. A gradual rollout of advanced digital
    technologies can leave time for adjustment and adaptation while sudden and thoroughgoing
    changes will cause more disruption and displacement. Since the digital economy
    is not monolithic, there will doubtless be a range of experiences, but we know
    from history that technology adoption is not a simple, continuous, uncontested,
    or automatic process. Technologies tend to develop at uneven and unpredictable
    rates, and deployment can suffer under fragmented and competing standards, especially
    when there is a high requirement for connectivity, interoperability, and integration
    across organizations and political jurisdictions. Mercantilism and rising techno-nationalism
    could create additional institutional and legal barriers that could further impede
    the digital economy. Social, technical, and institutional factors, such as data
    security risks or a regulatory backlash across various digital divides, could
    slow or even derail the development of the digital economy—or reshape it for the
    better. So, what can we expect from the digital economy? First, as stressed by
    McAfee and Brynjolfsson (2017), the impact of any revolutionary technology is
    often over-estimated in the short term and under-estimated over the long term.
    Second, in prior technological disruptions, from steam engines to electric power
    to digital computing, the logic of efficiency has often run ahead of the capacities
    of organizations and society at large to adapt, requiring significant reshaping
    and accommodation in order to reach a more mature and humane footing (Bodrožić
    & Adler, 2018). If the digital economy follows such a cycle, we may already be
    crossing an inflection point where the techno-optimists extolling the revolutionary
    benefits of the digital economy are feeling its sobering effects: negative societal
    and competitive outcomes that result in new regulation and antitrust enforcement
    actions (Klein, 2019). At the same time, less developed economies may experience
    weaker backlash and feel the drag of legacy systems and routines less intensely.
    If government and institutional support is effective in making long-term investments
    in talent development and closing information gaps, progress along the digital
    frontier could be quite rapid and beneficial. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The author would

    and GVCs” session at the Society for the Advancement of Socio-Economics 28th Annual
    Conference in Lyon, France, July 1, 2017. Endnotes 1 Advances in digital ICT are
    not entirely driven by improvements in the cost-performance of hardware (i.e.,
    microelectronics). They have emerged from more efficient approaches to software
    development (e.g., object-oriented programming) and in the design of microprocessor
    architecture, such as the embedding of higher-level software “microcode” in hardware
    and shifting from hardware-centric complex instruction set computing (CISC) to
    software-centric reduced instruction set computing (RISC). 2 Process improvements
    in semiconductor fabrication have progressed at an exponential, or log–linear
    rate, doubling circuit density every 16 months. This so-far inexorable path of
    improvement is often referred to as Moore''s Law, as it was first expressed by
    Gordon Moore, co-founder of Fairchild Semiconductor and Intel. 3 Another driver
    of these advances, both in ICT hardware and in the algorithms that it runs, has
    been high speed securities trading. Digital ICT has also provided many of the
    tools underpinning breakthroughs in disciplines such as material sciences (nano-scale
    structures) and biology (CRISPR). While the gene editing technology represented
    by CRIPSR is not related to ICT, it is necessary tool to allow biologists to sift
    through the human genome, which is made up of more than 3 billion base chromosome
    pairs. 4 Of course, there are other market domains that represent important parts
    of the digital economy, both as a driver and set of end uses, such as military
    and public administration. In fact, application of advanced digital technologies
    to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of public administration can be a
    main focus in less developed economies. However, these market domains are out
    of scope for this paper. 5 For example, iRobot''s Roomba home vacuum can collect
    data on furniture placement and room sizes in user''s homes that is of value to
    furniture sellers, see: https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/25/technology/roomba-irobot-data-privacy.html
    6 While the term “robot” has largely reserved for machines with flexible, vaguely
    humanoid arms, the International Standard Organization defines a robot more broadly
    as any “automatically controlled, reprogrammable, multipurpose manipulator, programmable
    in three or more axes, which can be either fixed in place or mobile for use in
    industrial automation applications.” (See https://ifr.org/standardisation.) 7
    Manufacturing technologies are also driven forward by new product development
    and basic science. In the most advanced and experimental manufacturing environments,
    such as the creation of new materials, complex pharmaceuticals, and synthetic
    biologics, it can become difficult to separate new products from new processes
    (Bonvillian, 2017). 8 Google Glass, after failing to catch hold in the consumer
    realm, has recently had a revival in an “Enterprise Edition” for this type of
    application (Bershidsky, 2017). 9 Cloud storage and computing resources run over
    the internet but are not public goods. Companies such as Apple, Dropbox, and Facebook
    run their own “private clouds,” but these are dwarfed by “public clouds,” which
    offer services, for a fee, to both consumers and corporate clients such as Netflix.
    The main services provided over the public cloud are computing and storage infrastructure,
    applications, and platforms, all running on demand “as-a-service.” According to
    Miller (2018), citing McAfee, Amazon Web Services controlled 42% of the public
    cloud market in 2017, followed by Microsoft with 30% and others, including Google,
    Rackspace, and IBM, with about 3% each. 10 Edge computing can improve network
    security in several ways. First, content caching and data redundancy can render
    denial of service attacks less potent because requests for service cannot be concentrated
    in centralized data repositories. Second, local processors are more difficult
    for nefarious actors to hack than IoT devices fully controlled from the cloud.
    Third automatic software updating can keep systems more secure by applying patches
    and upgrades, essentially removing vulnerable out-of-date software from the system.
    11 Such technical problems can quickly become societal problems, as when such
    incorrect or racially biasedmetadata tags are used to retrieve personal credit
    information data in AI-assisted loan processing systems (Rona-Tas, 2019). 12 For
    example, AI, machine learning, data visualization, and related data science algorithms
    and training data are all easily downloadable for free on open source software
    code repositories such as GitHub. 13 Examples include Yelp, Amazon, Alibaba, TripAdvisor,
    Hotels.com, AirBnB, HomeAway, and C-Trip. 14 The volume of data flowing in the
    digital economy is indeed staggering. According to McAfee and Brynjolfsson (2012),
    “…it is estimated that Wal-Mart collects more than 2.5 petabytes of data every
    hour from its customer transactions. A petabyte is one quadrillion bytes, or the
    equivalent of about 20 million filing cabinets'' worth of text.” 15 Biometric
    identification systems are used not only to identify and arrest criminals, but
    to shame people who commit minor infractions (Mozur, 2018). Data of this type
    contributes to China''s Social Credit System, begun in 2014, which aggregates
    data from a range of government and private sources (such as financial institutions
    and on-line retailers) to penalize people with low scores or privilege those with
    high scores (Nittle, 2018). 16 The companies were under pressure to create new
    revenue streams in the wake of the dot.com bust (2000), while the agencies were
    tasked with fighting a war on terror in the wake of nine of 11 (2001). 17 The
    standards and protocols supporting value chain modularity are often embedded in
    digital ICT systems such as computer aided design and manufacturing (CAD/CAM),
    and enterprise and manufacturing resource planning software (ERP/MRP). Operators
    can “port” the outputs from these systems to conform with the input requirements
    of various downstream systems simply by manually choosing an output format or
    systems can be pre-configured to automatically produce results in a range of formats.
    18 In the words of Baldwin (2008), managers purposefully and strategically seek
    to add simplified “pinch points” in the flow of “thick” and complex relational
    work flows, creating formal “transactions” where none previously existed. 19 An
    example is the Linux operating system, which was developed, maintained, and distributed
    voluntarily by software engineers as a free resource—originally as an alternative
    to Microsoft Windows—and now runs the majority of the world''s computer servers,
    controls many consumer electronics products, and provides the basis for Google''s
    Android smartphone operating system. 20 An example is the Open Compute Project
    (OCP), formed when Facebook opted to open up its in-house data center design specifications
    in 2011. Data centers, while critical to Facebook''s huge cloud operations, were
    not considered a core competency (Bort, 2015). The company''s purchasing power
    allowed it to bring a range of partners on-board, including the cloud infrastructure
    services provider Rackspace, which adopted OCP in 2012. By 2016, OCP was supported
    by other large data users such as Microsoft, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Panasonic,
    and Sony; makers of complementary hardware and components such as Intel, Schneider
    Electric and Emerson Network Power; and network carriers such as AT&T, Verizon,
    and Deutsche Telekom (Miller, 2016). Google, a holdout, submitted its first rack
    design to OCP in 2016 (Novet, 2016). Because OCP is open, it allows data center
    operators greater control and flexibility in regard to components and features,
    including storage technologies, central processing units, memory, and operating
    systems. It has enabled Rackspace to move away from proprietary servers and server
    rack architectures provided by traditional vendors such as Hewlett Packard, Dell-EMC,
    and Lenovo (formerly IBM), and purchase lower-cost generic servers from new entrants
    based in Taiwan, such as Quanta Cloud Technology, WiWynn (Wistron), Delta Group,
    and Cloudline, a joint venture between HP Enterprise and FoxConn. Interestingly,
    Rackspace''s business model is to lease data center space from server farm owners
    such as DuPont Fabros and Digital Realty, though the specifications for its server
    technologies are determined by the company (Miller, 2016). 21 Examples include
    Facebook, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Alibaba, General Electric, SAP, and many
    others. 22 Examples include Bluetooth, 3G/4G, and WiFi, membership- or alliance-based
    protocols such as ZigBee and Z-wave, and proprietary third party protocols such
    as Sigfox (Greenough & Camhi, 2016). 23 AI cloud service examples include IBM''s
    Watson, Google''s DialogFlow, Microsoft Azure''s BotService, and Amazon Web Services''
    Lex. See: https://www.datamation.com/cloud-computing/artificial-intelligence-as-a-service-ai-meets-the-cloud.html

    25 Methods for managing complexity in ICT systems run deeper than what is suggested
    here, and are not entirely driven by improvements in the cost-performance of hardware
    (i.e., microelectronics). They have emerged in higher-level approaches to software
    development (e.g., object-oriented programming) and in the design of microprocessor
    architecture (e.g., embedding higher-level software “microcode” in hardware and
    shifting from hardware-centric complex instruction set computing [CISC] to software-centric
    reduced instruction set computing [RISC]). 26 Strategic questions of how companies
    can elevate their technology, products, or services to become part of a dominant
    platform, while of great interest to many observers and a mainstay of the management
    literature (e.g., Parker et al., 2016), are not the central focus of this paper.
    27 For example, Uber''s platform connects drivers to riders, just as Amazon connects
    buyers to product vendors, and Airbnb connects apartment owners with renters.
    28 An example is Tencent''s WeChat messaging ecosystem, launched in 2011, which
    runs on top of existing mobile operating systems (Android and iOS, which in turn
    run on handset platforms and chipset platforms). As WeChat encapsulated a growing
    list of functions beyond messaging, such as banking and money transfer, social
    media, flight, and restaurant reservations, etc., it has attracted nearly 1 billion
    active monthly users, mainly in China, and in turn spawned an industry of platform
    complementors that produce “mini-apps” that run on WeChat. 29 Such as the “application
    program interfaces” (APIs) published by platform owners. 30 This sub-section draws
    on discussions with Justin Barnes, Executive Director of the Toyota Wessels Institute
    for Manufacturing Studies (TWIMS) in Durban, South Africa. 31 For example, Amazon
    brands only a small portion of the products on its platform, AirBnB own no rental
    property, Uber no cars, Facebook no newsroom, etc. 32 Current examples include
    General Electric''s Predix and Siemens'' MindSphere industrial analytics platforms,
    each encouraging its own ecosystem of third-party application suppliers, integrators,
    and resellers. 33 In the terms of global value chain governance theory (Gereffi
    et al., 2005), linkages in such digital value chains would be more “relational”
    and based on sharing tacit knowledge. 34 Still, there are a plethora of services
    and consumer markets where local firms can leverage knowledge of local preferences
    and institutional factors such as labor and tax reporting regulations, engaging
    in “regulatory arbitrage.” (Thanks to Ezequiel Zylberberg of MIT''s Industrial
    Performance Center for this point.) REFERENCES Citing Literature Volume11, Issue1

    Cited By: 16 Abstract In the last few years, while the COVID-19 pandemic affects
    food supply chains around the world, the agriculture sector also has faced many
    global problems, such as global warming, environmental pollution, climate change,
    and weather disasters. It has known that technological opportunities are available
    for human beings to get out of these predicaments, solving the interconnections
    between food-water-energy- climate nexus, and achieving agricultural transformation
    from traditional to digital. The aim of this review is to gain holistic solutions
    in a systematic view, based on water-energy-food resources to agricultural digital
    transformation that will play role in sustainable development. The transition
    from primitive to digital is given with road maps covering agricultural and industrial
    revolutions at four stages on timeline. Digital agriculture combined under precision
    agriculture and Agriculture 4.0 are handled based on domains covering monitoring,
    control, prediction, and logistics. Digital technologies are explained with application
    examples such as the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, big data, artificial
    intelligence, decision support systems, etc. Wearable sensor technologies, real-time
    monitoring systems tracking whole conditions of animals in livestock, the IoT-based
    irrigation and fertilization systems that help enhance the efficiency of irrigation
    processes and minimize water and fertilizer losses in agricultural fields and
    greenhouses, blockchain-based electronic agriculture, and solutions based on drones
    and robotics that reduce herbicide and pesticide use are handled systematically.
    Moreover, renewable energy technologies to be provided synergy between technologies
    such as agrivoltaics and aquavoltaics combining food and energy production in
    rural are explained, besides solar-powered pivot and drip irrigation systems and
    environmental monitoring systems. As a result, for a sustainable future, technological
    innovations that increase crop productivity and improve crop quality, protect
    the environment, provide efficient resource use and decrease input costs can help
    us facing in agriculture of today overwhelm many the economic, social, and environmental
    challenges. Keywords Smart Farming, Digital transformation, Sustainable development,

  explanation: 'This study aimed to use wireless soil moisture sensors to simulate
    dynamic irrigation management zones (MZs) in two maize fields, enabling variable-rate
    irrigation (VRI) in response to precise and dynamic field-specific soil moisture
    content data.


    The study employed a LoRaWAN-based wireless soil moisture sensor network and GIS
    capabilities to collect soil moisture data and generate irrigation management
    zones. The VRI maps were then processed to fit the application technology available,
    in this case, a variable rate hose reel irrigation machine (VRFM).


    Two important findings emerged from the study. First, the results demonstrated
    that the VRI maps can be successfully fitted to the VRFM, enabling the implementation
    of the proposed solution in practical applications. Second, the study highlighted
    the spatiotemporal variations in irrigation needs within the fields, indicating
    that a dynamic update of irrigation maps is required for each irrigation event
    based on the latest soil moisture data.'

    \ This study aimed to simulate dynamic irrigation management zones (MZs) in two\
    \ maize\nfields for a variable rate hose reel fertigation machine (VRFM) with\
    \ a four-section boom control. Soil\nmoisture content was measured from nine and\
    \ four soil moisture sensors in Field 1 (8.2 ha) and\nField 2 (2.5 ha), respectively,\
    \ on different dates during the 2022 crop season. Three and five MZs\nscenarios\
    \ were simulated per irrigation and the theoretical maps were processed for implementation.\n\
    The application maps fitted to the VRFM showed significant spatiotemporal variations\
    \ in irrigation\nrequirements. For instance, in Field 1, 3-MZ modelling showed\
    \ that the areas requiring high (H),\nmedium (M), and low (L)-level irrigation\
    \ on 21 July were 1.60, 4.84, and 1.85 ha, respectively, even\nthough the farmer\
    \ applied uniform rate over the whole field. H-level sub-areas ranged between\n\
    1.22 ha (25 July) and 3.25 ha (7 July), showing a coefficient of variation (CV)\
    \ of 43.32% for the three\nMZs, whereas H-level sub-areas for the five MZs varied\
    \ from 0.41 ha (2 July) to 1.49 ha (7 July) with\na CV value of 48.84%. High levels\
    \ of within-field variability can be addressed using precise and\ndynamic irrigation\
    \ MZs fitted to the irrigation technology used.\nKeywords: irrigation; maize;\

    \ common and significantly\naffect agricultural production [1]. Commonly used\
    \ in arid farming regions and during\ntimes of low rainfall, irrigation is the\
    \ process of adding water to the soil to increase crop\ngrowth and replant degraded\
    \ soil [2]. Irrigation depends on regional climatic conditions;\nhowever, as climate\
    \ change begins to affect new regions that were not affected by drought\nin the\
    \ past, the need for irrigation also arises in these regions. According to research\
    \ and\ncurrent practices, farmers’ use of irrigation is increasing, even in northern\
    \ EU countries. In\ncountries where irrigation is widely used, irrigation technologies\
    \ have improved substan-\ntially. Consequently, it is reasonable to assume that\
    \ irrigation will receive greater attention\nin parts of the world where it was\
    \ not a priority before. Precision irrigation is necessary\nbecause of the rising\
    \ demand for water to combat climate concerns. To achieve higher\nagricultural\
    \ yields and water savings, it is crucial to choose when and how much to irrigate.\n\
    Soil Syst. 2024, 8, 19. https://doi.org/10.3390/soilsystems8010019\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/soilsystems\n\
    Soil Syst. 2024, 8, 19\n2 of 23\nThe four most popular methods of operation for\
    \ irrigation scheduling, namely evapotran-\nspiration and water balance (ET-WB),\
    \ soil moisture status, plant water status, and crop\nmodels, along with their\
    \ advantages and disadvantages, are introduced and contrasted to\nbetter understand\
    \ their fundamental processes and principles [3]. It is necessary to have\nknowledge\
    \ of soil properties, including texture, water-holding capacity (WHC), wetness,\n\
    and crop water requirements, at different growth stages [4].\nWith the advancement\
    \ of contemporary sensors and sensing technology, a variety\nof technologies,\
    \ such as wireless sensor networks (WSNs), remote sensing (RS), global\nnavigation\
    \ satellite system (GNSS), geographic information systems (GIS), LoRaWAN, and\n\
    Bluetooth can now be used to collect field data for precision irrigation. WSNs\
    \ have been\nwidely used in agriculture for automated irrigation management because\
    \ they are cost-\neffective and have low energy consumption [5–8]. In addition\
    \ to wired solutions, wireless\nsensor technologies have become more important\
    \ and widely used [9], particularly in\nweather forecasting, early warning systems,\
    \ soil and crop monitoring, and automated and\nsmart irrigation [10–12]. Wireless\
    \ sensor networks with cloud capabilities are promising\nbecause the end-user\
    \ does not have to handle collecting and storing the data.\nIt has been well documented\
    \ that parameters affecting the yield of any crop exhibit\nspatial and temporal\
    \ variations [13–16]. Despite awareness of this, the great majority of\nfarmers\
    \ today are known to apply a constant rate over the field while they vary the\
    \ total\namount of water from one irrigation to another during the irrigation\
    \ season depending on\nthe soil, plant, and weather conditions. At present, a\
    \ limited number of farmers seem to\ndetermine irrigation needs based on climate\
    \ data and some sensor data, if any. One of the\nmost important factors affecting\
    \ the adoption of precision or smart irrigation technologies\nis that the accuracy\
    \ of the moisture sensor changes with time in the field, necessitating\noccasional\
    \ calibration. Other factors that cause difficulties for the average end-user\
    \ include\ncost, installation, data collection, and interpretation issues. Although\
    \ the advantages of\nvariable rate irrigation have been documented, the adoption\
    \ rate of this technology has\nbeen low; however, efforts to develop the technology\
    \ should continue for several reasons,\nincluding climate change, declining water\
    \ resources, nutrient management regulations,\nand water management policies [17].\n\
    The development of variable-rate irrigation control systems has attracted considerable\n\
    attention since the early 2000s. Some of these studies focused on center-pivot\
    \ and linearly\nmoving irrigation systems [18–20]. The development of smart irrigation\
    \ systems is of\nthe utmost interest and requires the accurate determination of\
    \ all parameters affecting\nirrigation [10,21]. Smart systems require not only\
    \ sensor-based monitoring but also the\nintegration of Internet of Things (IoT)\
    \ and cloud technologies [10,22–26]. Ref. [27] reviewed\nvarious water management\
    \ techniques and the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and deep\nlearning (DL),\
    \ along with the IoT network and case studies. Although previous studies have\n\
    covered new techniques to apply irrigation water more intelligently, there is\
    \ still a need to\nimprove the current applications by considering the dynamic\
    \ variations in irrigation needs\nwithin fields more precisely. There have been\
    \ studies focusing on variable rate irrigation\n(VRI) using hose reel machines,\
    \ but they usually use the full-swath width as the lateral\nresolution [28–32].\
    \ There appears to be a research gap regarding improvements in the lateral\nand\
    \ longitudinal resolutions of VRI applications using hose reel machines. Furthermore,\n\
    spatial and temporal changes during the irrigation period should be addressed\
    \ in the\nmanagement of VRI.\nThe general objective of this study was to simulate\
    \ spatiotemporal variations in\nirrigation needs of maize crops based on dynamic\
    \ irrigation management zones using\na wireless soil moisture sensor network and\
    \ GIS capabilities. This study compared the\nconstant user rates of irrigation\
    \ water on different irrigation dates with that of the sensor-\nbased simulated\
    \ variable irrigation rate. It assesses the right time and rate for irrigation,\n\
    determines the accuracy of user rate applications, and analyses the dynamic irrigation\n\

    \ (AW), according to [37].\nSoil Syst. 2024, 8, 19\n5 of 23\nThe irrigation efficiency\
    \ (EF) was taken (Equation (6)) as 90% for the drip irrigation\nsystem [38], to\
    \ calculate sensor-based irrigation needs based on field capacity and moisture\n\
    measurement. The irrigation time was based on MAD + 30% limit, which was taken\
    \ to be\n30% of the difference between the FC and MAD values.\nThe irrigations\
    \ started before the sensors were ready to collect real-time MC data.\nAfter processing\
    \ the sensor data, only eight irrigation applications were considered for the\n\
    analyses.\n2.3.1. Water Use Comparison between User- and Sensor-Based Constant\
    \ Irrigation Rates\nThe farmer used inline linear drippers (Eurodrip-Eolos, Rivulis,\
    \ Gvat, Israel) in the\nirrigations with an irrigation intensity of 28.8 t h−1\
    \ ha−1 at an operating pressure of\n3 bar. The pressure at the end of each secondary\
    \ line was measured using a handheld\nanalog pressure gauge (Pakkens 0–6 bar)\
    \ so that the flow rate was the same and the water\ndistribution was uniform in\
    \ each irrigation plot. For each irrigation, the farmer varied the\nirrigation\
    \ time from 6 to 10 h per irrigation, depending on the job and employee status.\
    \ The\nuser irrigation rate was determined by the experience of the farmer, crop\
    \ water demands\ngiven in the irrigation guide for the Bursa-Karacabey district,\
    \ and evapotranspiration\nvalues provided by the farmer’s weather station (Metos\
    \ IMT280).\nWireless MC sensors were configured to deliver MC data every 20 min\
    \ in this study. To\nconfirm a sensor-based constant irrigation recommendation\
    \ on a given irrigation day, the\nMC value measured just before irrigation was\
    \ obtained from each sensor, and the average of\nall sensor readings was used\
    \ as the sensor-based field-scale soil MC value. Equation (6) was\nused to determine\
    \ the amount of water to be applied (irrigation need) to bring the moisture\n\
    content of the field to the field capacity for a given irrigation date. The differences\
    \ among\nthe soil moisture sensor measurements for each irrigation date were calculated\
    \ to reveal the\nrange of soil moisture content within the field. Within-field\
    \ soil moisture content variations\nwere evaluated to assess the accuracy of uniform\
    \ irrigation in the trial fields. A descriptive\nstatistics analysis was performed\
    \ in terms average, difference, standard deviation, and\ncoefficient of variance\
    \ (CV).\n2.3.2. Variable Rate Irrigation Recommendations\nThe ordinary kriging\
    \ (OK) interpolation method was implemented using ArcGIS\nArcMap v10.8 (ESRI Redlands,\
    \ Redlands, CA, USA) software to generate variable rate\nirrigation (VRI) maps.\
    \ The irrigation needs (IN, mm da−1, where 1.0 da = 0.1 ha) were\nmapped with\
    \ three and five management zones (MZs) for each field to compare the effects\n\
    of different resolutions for irrigation. The three and five MZs were selected\
    \ to see the effects\nof the number of MZs on the variability in irrigation needs.\n\
    First, a theoretical application map was produced for the irrigation dates (2,\
    \ 5, 7, 13,\n17, 21, 25 July and 4 August) for F1 and F2, resulting in 32 maps\
    \ (8 days × 2 different\nzone maps × 2 fields). The amount of water to be applied\
    \ in each irrigation MZ was\ntabulated based on the irrigation rate and the total\
    \ area of each irrigation management zone\nin each field. The user-applied uniform\
    \ rates and variable-rate irrigation recommendations\nwere then compared to meet\
    \ the irrigation demands of the soil based on the postulated\nirrigation zones.\n\
    Then, the theoretical 3- and 5-zone irrigation need maps were further processed\
    \ for\nVRI application to be applied using a variable rate hose reel fertigation\
    \ system being\ndeveloped as part of the project. The VRFM has a working width\
    \ of 46 m, and it is proposed\nto have four sections, each to be individually\
    \ controlled for VRI applications. Thus, using\ntheoretical maps, applicable irrigation\
    \ maps were obtained for cell sizes of 11.5 m × 1 m.\nApplicable maps were presented\
    \ for the irrigation dates of 7, 17, and 25 July and 4 August\nto discuss the\
    \ effect of management zones on the water distribution within the fields and\n\
    were compared with theoretical IN maps.\nSentinel 2A satellite data were used\
    \ to generate the Normalized Difference Vegetation\nIndex (NDVI) maps corresponding\
    \ to the nearest irrigation dates. The Sentinel-2A im-\nSoil Syst. 2024, 8, 19\n\
    6 of 23\nages were downloaded from https://scihub.copernicus.eu/dhus/#/home (accessed\
    \ on 14\nSeptember 2023) in bottom-of-atmosphere L2A format. A total of eight\
    \ images from 1 July,\n6 July, 13 July, 21 July, 26 July, and 5 August 2022, covering\
    \ the study area, atmospherically\ncorrected, and cloudless were used for analysis.\
    \ For each S2 scene, the red (band 4), and\nNIR (band 8) spectral bands with a\
    \ 10 m spatial resolution were selected for the NDVI\ncalculation according to\
    \ [39] formula.\nAdditionally, the texture (clay, silt, and sand) was mapped for\
    \ F1 and F2 in an attempt\nto find potential cause-and-effects of NDVI and soil\
    \ texture on the spatiotemporal variations\nin irrigation water needs across the\
    \ fields studied.\n3. Results and Discussion\n3.1. User-Rate and Sensor-Based\
    \ Constant Irrigation Comparisons\nNine out of twelve sensors were utilized for\
    \ soil moisture measurements due to\nunexpected weak signals, battery, or installation\
    \ problems in three of the sensors installed\nin F1; four of the six sensors were\
    \ operable in F2 (Table 1). The average FC, PWP, and\nMAD values in F1 were approximately\
    \ 139, 66, and 37 mm, respectively. The average\nvolumetric weight of the soil\
    \ samples was 1.45 (g cm−3) with a small coefficient of variation\n(CV) value\
    \ (1.82%). Other parameters included in Table 1 had variations with CV values\n\
    ranging from approximately 4.2 to 7.3%. In F2, based on measurements performed\
    \ by the\nfour soil moisture sensors, the FC was smaller and VW was higher compared\
    \ with F1. The\nMAD values were smaller than those of F1. The coefficient of variation\
    \ of the measured\nparameters in F2, except for PWP, ranged from 2.02 to 8.46%.\
    \ The high CV value of PWP\nmay be attributed to the fewer sensors used, and hence,\
    \ to fewer data points to be averaged.\nTable 1. Laboratory results for soil samples\

    \ 7 to 10 h depending on\nthe weather, crop conditions, and labor availability\
    \ (Table 2). More water should have been\napplied throughout the season to align\
    \ the soil MC with the FC. For instance, on July 7, the\napplied user rate was\
    \ 23.04 t da−1 as a result of 8 h irrigation, which was 14.7% less than the\n\
    recommended rate based on the average of the soil MC measurements. The overall\
    \ average\nof user rates was 22.68 mm da−1 while the sensor-based application\
    \ rate was calculated\nSoil Syst. 2024, 8, 19\n7 of 23\nto be 29.83 mm da−1. The\
    \ overall difference between the user and sensor-based rates was\n−22.76%, whereas\
    \ the differences ranged from −4.6% to −35.9% on specific dates. This\nmeans that\
    \ the soil received a smaller amount of water than it should have if the moisture\n\

    \ that\nthe irrigation duration could be adjusted more accurately by the farmer\

    \ and sensor-based irrigations were\n17.28–28.80 mm da−1 and 27.0–47.19 mm da−1,\
    \ respectively (Table 2). On average, through-\nout the irrigation season, the\
    \ user-based rate of irrigation water application was 45.09%\nless than the recommended\
    \ IN. In this case, the difference was more significant than that\nfor F1. Although\
    \ the farmer intended to apply water every 3–4 days after 7 July, due to\nlabor\
    \ shortage, an irrigation was skipped between 7 July and 13 July. Automated irrigation\n\
    systems can reduce the dependency on workers to accomplish time-dependent tasks.\n\
    It should be noted that the above discussion does not account for spatial variations\n\
    in irrigation needs within a field. Even for a constant irrigation rate at the\
    \ whole-field\nscale, the use of soil moisture sensors revealed opportunities\
    \ for implementing irrigation at\nmore accurate times and rates. In [40], it was\
    \ concluded that the total profit was the same\nwhen sensor-based irrigation scheduling\
    \ was compared with the user application, but the\nsensor-based application was\
    \ found to be promising in terms of water and financial savings.\nThe variations\
    \ in the measured MC values on specific irrigation dates are shown in\nFigure\
    \ 3 for F1 and F2. Figure 3 also presents the average FC, PWP, and MAD values\
    \ to\nvisualize when irrigation had to be started and terminated.\nThe MC values\
    \ were expected to be around the MAD line before the irrigation started\nand near\
    \ the FC line after the irrigation was completed. The farmer always started irrigation\n\
    at a soil moisture content slightly below the MAD + 30% value in F1 (Figure 3a).\
    \ The\nirrigation timings were slightly after than the exact irrigation times.\
    \ After irrigation, the\nsoil MC was always lower than the FC. The farmer applied\
    \ irrigation water that did not\nexceed the FC for the entire field. However,\

    \ the penetration of the maize roots is\nshallower than in the later stages [3];\
    \ thus, maintaining the topsoil moisture should be\nmore important to avoid water\
    \ stress. The soil tended to generate cracks owing to the lack\nof moisture, especially\
    \ during windy periods that are common in the region. Therefore, it\nmay be recommended\
    \ to start irrigation earlier than occurred because the measured MC\nvalues before\
    \ irrigation were lower than the MAD + 30% values. MC values below the\nMAD +\
    \ 30% value in Figure 3a,b suggest that plants might have experienced water stress\n\
    during the early growth stages. To prevent this, frequent and sufficient irrigation\
    \ could\nhave been determined using the sensor-based data.\nSoil Syst. 2024, 8,\
    \ 19\n9 of 23\nFigure 3b suggests that the timing of irrigation was not accurate\
    \ for some irrigation\ndates in Field 2. The farmer started irrigating the field\
    \ at a soil MC level lower than the\nMAD + 30% value in four of the irrigations.\
    \ Furthermore, irrigation was terminated too\nearly since the after-irrigation\
    \ soil MC values were just above the MAD + 30% values and\nnot reaching the targeted\
    \ FC values. As demonstrated in Figure 3b, real-time data could\nbe used to accurately\
    \ determine the correct length and amount of irrigation, either done\nmanually\
    \ or automatically.\nFC and after-irrigation MC values were compared on each irrigation\
    \ day (Table 3). The\nMC of the soil was approximately 110 mm before irrigation\
    \ and increased to 128.2–137.5 mm\nwhile the average FC was 138.9 mm for the field.\
    \ The percent user difference in irrigation\nneeds between the user and the average\

    \ depending on the irrigation date. The MC values\nfollowing irrigations were\

    \ necessary to increase the soil MC values up to an average FC level of\n128 mm\
    \ in Field 2. Up to 17% more water should have been applied in Field 2 on 2 and\
    \ 5\nJuly, corresponding to the early growth stages of plants.\nThe spatial variation\
    \ in the before-irrigation MC values for each irrigation day is\nshown in Table\
    \ 4, where the first column shows the sensors installed in both fields. On\naverage,\
    \ the IN was between 30 and 35.5 mm before irrigation in F1. However, the IN was\n\
    calculated to range from 35.94 to 47.19 mm for F2, which was a wider range than\
    \ for F1.\nThe average irrigation need for each irrigation date was greater in\
    \ F2 than in F1,\nprobably because of the different ranges between the FC and\
    \ PWP, and hence the MAD\nvalues in the two fields. The average MAD value of F1\
    \ was greater than that of F2, requiring\nmore water delivery to irrigate the\
    \ field up to field capacity.\n3.2. Constant vs. Variable Rate Irrigation\nAs\
    \ discussed in the previous subsection, irrigation scheduling based on soil moisture\n\
    sensors has the potential to improve the timing and amount of irrigation water\
    \ required.\nHowever, the above discussion was based on the average of all readings\
    \ from the soil\nmoisture sensors. As the sensors were in different parts of the\
    \ field, it would be more\nuseful to determine the spatial irrigation needs on\
    \ a given irrigation day. Table 5 shows the\ndifference between the average before-irrigation\
    \ MC values and point-based MC values\non each irrigation day. The data show that\
    \ some parts of the field required more or less\nSoil Syst. 2024, 8, 19\n10 of\

    \ have been applied at S10\nif the average before-irrigation MC values had been\

    Table 6 shows the partitioning of the sub-section areas of the three- and five-zone\n\
    irrigation maps for F1 and F2 derived from the maps in Figures 4 and 5, respectively.\n\
    The H level irrigation rate corresponded to areas from 0.89 ha to 32.6 ha with\
    \ five-zone\nanalysis in F1 whereas three-zone analysis resulted in 0.14 ha to\
    \ 14.3 ha for H level rates on\ndifferent irrigation days. Dividing the field\
    \ into management zones shows that different\nparts of the field require different\
    \ application rates to bring the soil MC to the FC. Five\nzones depicted the distribution\
    \ of the rates more precisely for each irrigation date. In F2,\nthe zone areas\
    \ were smaller due to the smaller field size compared to that of F1. The CV\n\
    values from about 45–65% both for F1 and F2 also show that the application rates\
    \ for each\nzone need to be changed significantly over time. For instance, the\
    \ CV level of 46.7% for\nM level area in the five-zone analysis was found in areas\
    \ ranging from 3.0 ha (21 July) to\n13.87 ha (4 August). The IN maps shown in\
    \ Figures 5–8 are not readily applicable because\nof the lack of precise application\
    \ technologies that can deliver irrigation water based on\ncontour maps. The length\
    \ of the lateral pipes in a drip irrigation system is designed to\nbe the same\
    \ length in each management zone in sub-plot areas of up to four hectares in\n\
    the current practices in the Karacabey district, intersecting with the simulated\
    \ IN maps.\nFurthermore, the dynamic variation in the irrigation management zone\
    \ from one irrigation\nto the next requires an irrigation system that can respond\
    \ accordingly.\nSoil Syst. 2024, 8, 19\n17 of 23\nTable 6. Variation in area (ha)\

    \ lengths. The lateral\nand longitudinal resolutions of the machine and the number\
    \ of zones will be the initial\ndeterminants for the overall precision of the\
    \ variable-rate irrigation application.\nTable 7 provides the updated sub-areas\
    \ of each management zone after the maps\nwere fitted to the widths of the sections\
    \ of the VRFM. When rectangular cells with fixed\nwidths and varying lengths were\
    \ used, the total area of each management zone changed\naccordingly. For instance,\
    \ three-zone H-level application areas for F1 ranged from 1.22 ha\nto 3.67 ha\
    \ for different irrigation dates, which were 0.90 ha to 3.26 ha in Table 6. For\
    \ F2,\nL-level areas with five-zone analysis ranged from 0.29 ha (4 August) to\
    \ 0.98 ha (21 July) in\nTable 7, whereas these areas were 0.27 ha and 0.99 ha,\
    \ respectively for 4 August and 21 July\nin Table 6. In terms of the variations\
    \ among irrigation days, the CV values were high in the\napplication maps fitted\
    \ to the VRF machine, ranging from 25.77 to 67.4%.\nThe means of three-zone areas\
    \ for H, M, and L levels were 2.22, 4.34, and 1.71 ha in\nField 1 and 0.50, 1.24,\
    \ 1.24, and 0.75 ha in Field 2. The large area differences among the\nzones show\
    \ that the constant-rate applications introduce large errors in the application\n\
    rates. Similar evaluations can be performed for a specific irrigation date. For\
    \ instance,\nfive-zone areas corresponding to 17 July in F1 range from 0.53 ha\
    \ (H level) to 4.1 ha (M level)\nwith the largest area, showing up to eight-fold\
    \ difference in area between different zones.\nIt is documented in the literature\
    \ that precision agriculture has the potential to reduce the\nexcess amount of\
    \ inputs in production agriculture, along with an increase in profit and\nenergy\
    \ saving [41,42]. Ref. [43] found large irrigation need differences within a study\
    \ field,\nwith a water requirement of up to 26% less in the management zones compared\
    \ to user-rate\napplications and suggested that sensor-based variable-rate irrigation\
    \ scheduling would\nprevent users from applying over- or under-irrigation.\nSoil\

    \ MZs, and hence the instantaneous irrigation needs\nin a given field is of utmost\
    \ importance to optimize water use within the fields. In this study,\nthe irrigation\
    \ needs of two maize fields were determined based on spatiotemporal soil\nmoisture\
    \ content variations using LoRaWAN-based soil moisture sensor technology in an\n\
    attempt to simulate the dynamic irrigation management zones to be used with a\
    \ hose reel\nirrigation machine. Wireless soil MC monitoring technology enabled\
    \ the determination of\naccurate timing and rates for irrigation to meet the field\
    \ capacity requirement. Simulations\nshowed that management zones changed temporally\
    \ within the fields, requiring an update\nof the irrigation map for the next irrigation.\
    \ It was demonstrated that resolutions of\nthe theoretical (contour) irrigation\
    \ maps could be converted to applicable grids or cells\nto be used by advanced\
    \ variable rate irrigation systems. A section-controlled variable\nrate hose reel\
    \ irrigation machine (VRIM) is currently under development to implement\nthe solution\
    \ postulated in this study. Future work should adopt data fusion of weather,\n\
    electrical conductivity (EC), leaf area index (LAI), and satellite thermal and\
    \ NDVI data in\nan attempt to improve irrigation management zones for a variable\
    \ rate hose reel irrigation\nsystem. Future irrigation scheduling methods should\
    \ also focus on the management of\nsoil moisture based on an advanced understanding\
    \ of its effects on crop growth, either\nby integrating existing irrigation scheduling\
    \ methods or developing new models using\nadvanced algorithms.\nSoil Syst. 2024,\

    Abstract: Using a systematic review of literature, this study identiﬁes the potential\
    \ impact of\nblockchain solutions for augmenting supply chain resilience (SCR)\
    \ to cybercrime. This rich lit-\nerature synthesis forms the basis of a novel\
    \ theoretical framework that provides guidance and insight\nfor blockchain adopters\
    \ and vendors as well as delineate palpable beneﬁts of this novel technology.\n\
    An interpretivist philosophical design and inductive reasoning are adopted to\
    \ conduct the systematic\nreview of literature. A total of 867 papers were retrieved\
    \ from Scopus database between the years of\n2016 and 2020 and subsequently analysed\
    \ via abductive reasoning, grounded theory and a thematic\nmeta-analysis; where\
    \ the latter was achieved using a scientometric approach and software tools\n\
    such as VOS viewer and NVivo. Scientometric analysis revealed the most proliﬁc\
    \ countries, sources,\npublications and authors who reside at the vanguard of\
    \ blockchain developments and adoption.\nSubsequent grounded theory analysis identiﬁed\
    \ six main clusters of research endeavour viz: “case\nstudy”, “challenges and\
    \ opportunity”, “traceability”, “smart contract” “blockchain and IoT” and\n“data\
    \ security”. From 28 SCR metrics identiﬁed within literature, ﬁve were found to\
    \ have been\npositively impacted by blockchain technology solutions, namely: “visibility”,\
    \ “collaboration”, “in-\ntegration”, “risk management” and “information sharing.”\
    \ Prominent applications of blockchain\ntechnology in practice were “traceability\
    \ systems” and “smart contracts” which are often imple-\nmented separately or\
    \ in combination and primarily in food supply chains. This research constitutes\n\
    the ﬁrst study to critically synthesise extant literature for evaluation of blockchain\
    \ solutions’ implica-\ntion on SCR metrics. New perspectives obtained provided\
    \ a basis for the novel theoretical framework\nfor implementation that will be\
    \ valued by software developers and adopting organizations, whilst\ncreating new\
    \ direction for researchers interested in blockchain technology.\nKeywords: blockchain\
    \ technology; supply chain resilience; cybersecurity; resilience metrics\n1. Introduction\n\
    Since the discovery of blockchain technology’s viability in environments other\
    \ than\noriginal cryptocurrency practices, applications have exponentially proliferated\
    \ in diverse\nindustrial sectors such as: insurance [1]; content distribution\
    \ [2]; logistics [3,4]; travel [5];\nhealthcare [6,7]; e-commerce [8]; and banking\
    \ systems [9]. Novel supply chain applications\nare no exception and various work\
    \ has been undertaken to explore its applications pri-\nmarily on food supply\
    \ chains, particularly emphasizing product traceability and visibility\nenhancement\
    \ features cf. [10,11]. Other researchers such as Queiroz et al. [2], Sawyerr\
    \ and\nHarrison [12] and Maesa and Mori [13] studied blockchain’s innate immutability\
    \ aspects\nof stored transactional data.\nHowever, with multitudinous and largely\
    \ unforeseen disturbances to global supply\nchains (e.g., the Global Financial\
    \ Crises in 2008 [14]; the 9–11 terrorist attack [15,16] and\nCovid-19 pandemic\
    \ [17,18]) engenders the necessity to evaluate the impact of technological\nadvancements\
    \ on supply chains in times of disruption rather than solely measuring their\n\
    impact in a “business as usual” scenario [19,20]. Researchers studying the risks\
    \ associated\nBuildings 2021, 11, 283. https://doi.org/10.3390/buildings11070283\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/buildings\nBuildings 2021, 11, 283\n2 of 19\nwith\
    \ these unforeseen disruptions, categorize them into two major dichotomous group\
    \ of\n“external” and “internal” risk groups [21–23]. External risks are associated\
    \ with unexpected\nevents occurring extrinsically that stiﬂe the supply chain\
    \ system and induce a ripple effect\n(throughout the supply chain) that prolong\
    \ the recovery from the disruption [21,22]. Exam-\nples of external risks include\
    \ force majeure (e.g., earthquakes, hurricanes and ﬂoods) but\nalso man-made catastrophes\
    \ (e.g., computer viruses, terrorist attacks, economic turbulence\nor recession)\
    \ [19,20]. These risks not only have the inherent capacity to create operational\n\
    disruptions and shortages to supply chain participants, but also threatens an\
    \ organisation’s\nﬁnancial and human resources such that distribution, transportation\
    \ and communication\nsuffers immeasurably [20]. External risks are largely unavoidable\
    \ and hence, organisations\ncan only prepare to mitigate their disruption vis-à-vis\
    \ eliminate them [23]. Conversely,\ninternal risks are associated with uncertainties\
    \ of supply-demand coordination events or\nunprecedented change in product speciﬁcations\
    \ [20,24]. Forrester [25] deﬁned the “bull-\nwhip effect” concept in supply chains\
    \ as depicting ﬂuctuations in purchasing an inventory\nto fulﬁl customer demand\
    \ that accumulates towards the upstream of a supply chain. This\nconcept occurs\
    \ when a supplier’s order is larger than a buyer’s order and is often caused\n\
    by poor quality of information sharing, erroneous perceived demand and delays\
    \ in supply\nchains [26]. Other examples of internal risks are information technology\
    \ problems or\nbreakdowns, uncertainties in lead times, power outages, equipment\
    \ malfunctions and\nsystemic failures [27].\nThese numerous internal and external\
    \ risks (and their frequency of occurrence) in-\ncrease the vulnerability of supply\
    \ chains and necessitate development of risk mitigation\nmethods and strategies\
    \ to engender organisational resilience and preparedness [20,28]. Yet,\ndespite\
    \ these risks elucidated upon, circa 69% of organisations globally have no complete\n\
    visibility of their supply chains [29] and 30% of organisations fail to analyse\
    \ the source\nof disruptions [30]. These compelling statistics engender the need\
    \ for novel studies that\nanswer the question: what are the blockchain technology\
    \ applications that could potentially\naugment supply chain resilience (SCR) against\
    \ disruption risks? Therefore, this research\nseeks to deﬁne and delineate the\
    \ potential impact of these applications and their adoption(s)\non SCR metrics\
    \ using a scientometric review of existing literature. Concomitant research\n\
    objectives are to: provide much needed guidance on blockchain applications for\
    \ industry\npractitioners and for organisations planning to adopt them; and create\
    \ a cyber threat map\n(as a novel theoretical framework) by identifying common\
    \ cyber threats according to their\ntarget types and their current solutions to\
    \ contrast those solutions with blockchain poten-\ntials. New insights (including\
    \ a novel framework) generated will serve to incite wider\npolemic debate but\
    \ will also provide much needed guidance and clariﬁcation for software\ndevelopers\
    \ and adopting organizations.\n2. Methodology\nThe overarching epistemological\
    \ design adopted a mixed philosophical stance of inter-\npretivism and post-positivism\
    \ cf. [31–34] to systematically analyse extant literature using\na scientometric\
    \ approach (a sub-branch of bibliometrics) cf. [35–38]. As a philosophical\napproach,\
    \ interpretivism seeks to understand and interpret a phenomenon under investi-\n\
    gation from different points of view in a subjective way [39,40]. Conversely,\
    \ postpositivism\nis an approach of pursuing objectivity to reduce the potential\
    \ effect of researchers’ bias by\napplying both quantitative and qualitative methods\
    \ of data analysis [41]; in this present\nstudy using meta-data analysis. Objectivity\
    \ in postpositivist paradigm results in establish-\ning nascent theory that enables\
    \ building categories and dimensions from an irregular data\nset [42]. Mixed philosophies\
    \ are widely used within contemporary construction and project\nmanagement literature.\
    \ For example, Ghosh et al. [43] explored patterns and trends in the\napplication\
    \ of the internet of things (IoT) research to identify future applications in\
    \ the\nconstruction industry; and Oshodi et al. [44] conducted a systematic review\
    \ of construction\noutput modelling techniques. Given the investigative nature\
    \ of this research, inductive and\nabductive reasoning [39,45] are adopted to\

    Buildings 2021, 11, 283\n4 of 19\n2.2. Grounded Theory Technique\nGrounded theory\
    \ analysis was conducted using computer-assisted qualitative data\nanalysis software\
    \ (CAQDAS) called NVivo to provide a deeper and richer interrogation\nof the prevailing\
    \ academic discourse. To narrow the scope of data analysis, this stage\ncommenced\
    \ with thematic analysis of bibliometric data retrieved from Scopus journal\n\
    database (obtained from stage 1). All data retrieved were analysed manually in\
    \ a Microsoft\nExcel spreadsheet by colour-coding each emerging theme through\
    \ screening the titles and\nabstracts of each publication and clustering them\
    \ together. From initially sourced 867 publi-\ncations, papers with irrelevant\
    \ application areas (such as rental service, auditing and public\nvoting) were\
    \ excluded. Similarly, papers based on generic supply chain management and\nrisk\
    \ management matters were excepted from the dataset. Based on these screening\
    \ and\nﬁltering processes, thematical clusters of ‘case study’ (with 89 papers)\
    \ and ‘data security’\n(with 27 papers) were selected to further study using grounded\
    \ theory analysis. All the\npublications in those clusters were retrieved by locating\
    \ their digital object identiﬁer (DOI)\naddresses except for those without access\
    \ or link.\nGrounded theory is an approach of analysing data by fragmenting them\
    \ using key\nprocesses of ‘coding’, ‘theoretical sampling’ and ‘theoretical saturation’\
    \ [39]. The ﬁrst stage\nof open coding reveals emerging concepts in the publications\
    \ [39]. This approach of data\ncollection (by open coding through selected publications)\
    \ and analysis is referred as a\n“theoretical sampling” which is distinguished\
    \ from other sampling approaches because it\nemphasises selection of data to generate\
    \ a theoretical understanding rather than focusing\non statistical adequacy of\
    \ a sample [49]. Further these concepts are aggregated to achieve\ntheoretical\
    \ saturation, via which categories are generated. Based on these concepts and\n\
    categories the guidance note of blockchain application for vendors and potential\
    \ adopters\nwas subsequently generated.\n3. Supply Chain Resilience\nGlobalization\
    \ has stimulated organisations to change their strategies to expedite\nresponse\
    \ time and consequently, conventional competition amongst organizations has\n\
    been transformed into a race between whole supply chains that foregrounded supply\n\
    chain management and SCR [27,50]. A supply chain is a group of specialists such\
    \ as\nsupplier, manufacturer, distributor and retailer that create chains through\
    \ service and\nproduction by maintaining a ﬂow of goods and information [50].\
    \ It comprises a set of\nfacilities that help in purchasing required materials,\
    \ transforming them into intermediate or\nﬁnished goods, eventually distributing\
    \ these goods to customers [51]. Conversely, supply\nchain management characterizes\
    \ planning and control of all business processes, activities\nregarding the sourcing,\
    \ inventory and logistics along with coordination and collaboration\nwith other\
    \ participants in the supply chain [52]. The main objective of supply chain\n\
    management is to deliver superior customer value by integrating supply and demand\n\
    management within each organisation as well as whole supply chains [17]. However,\n\
    the formation of supply chains is scattered globally with different parts of the\
    \ chain\nlocated in different geographical locations; this increases supply chains’\
    \ vulnerability to\ndisruptions [12,23,53]. This is because, every actor in the\
    \ supply chain is affected differently\nby external impacts such as environmental,\
    \ social, economic and political factors [17,54].\nMitigation or eradication of\
    \ such risks, can be achieved by integration of the entire supply\nnetwork and\
    \ by improving transparency and visibility amongst supply chain participants,\n\
    which eventually augments SCR [22]. The term resilience has been used in different\
    \ subjects\nsuch as psychology, ecology, economy, social and organisational concepts\
    \ to denote the\nability of a given system to return to a state of equilibrium\
    \ after temporary disturbance [28].\nWhile, some authors cf. [55,56] analogously\
    \ accepted this deﬁnition in SCR area, others\ncf. [28,57] deﬁne resilience in\
    \ supply chain as a capability of supply chains to develop\npreparedness against\
    \ unforeseen disruptions to respond in a resourceful and timely manner\nand restore\
    \ their former condition or preferably in an improved state.\nBuildings 2021,\
    \ 11, 283\n5 of 19\nResilience in supply chains mitigates negative impacts of\
    \ contingencies by identifying\nand adopting strategies and apposite plan of actions\
    \ to recover to its original or better\nstate [20]. A myriad of systematic literature\
    \ review studies have been conducted to outline\nSCR strategies, metrics, capabilities\
    \ and performance measures to identify barriers and\nenablers to resilience in\
    \ supply chains [58]. A study by Bhamra et al. [59] discusses literature\nabout\
    \ resilience in small-to-medium-enterprises (SMEs) during the 1976–2010 timespan\n\
    and accentuate on the importance of more case-study based empirical studies. Contrary\
    \ to\nthis view, scholars such as Pereira et al. [60], Tukamuhabwa et al. [21],\
    \ Ali et al. [58] note\nthe inadequacy of theoretical applications in SCR studies,\
    \ while Datta [61] proposes using\nmore context-speciﬁc interventions. Both Linnenluecke\
    \ [62] and Sawyerr and Harrison [12]\nexamine high reliability theories stressing\
    \ the practicality of insights from high reliability\nstudies for SCR improvement.\n\
    3.1. Supply Chain Resilience Metrics\nMeasuring resilience in supply chains has\
    \ stimulated, scholars to deﬁne and delin-\neate numerous metrics differently.\
    \ Common terminologies used by authors to describe\nSCR metrics include: core\
    \ dimension [63]; antecedents [20,57,64]; capabilities [65,66]; en-\nablers [60,67];\
    \ competencies [68]; elements [55,58,69,70]; formative elements [12,65]; and\n\
    dimensions [71]. Sawyerr and Harrison [12] conclude that from thirteen formative\
    \ elements\nof SCR, ‘redundancy’, ‘human resource management’, ‘collaboration’,\
    \ ‘agility’, ‘ﬂexibility’,\n‘culture’ and ‘risk avoidance’ resilience metrics\
    \ can be applied to supply chains. The ﬁnd-\nings indicate that ‘collaboration’\
    \ with supply chain partners in the event of a disruption is\nthe ﬁrst prerequisite,\
    \ because it improves other elements of resilience such as ‘visibility’,\n‘awareness’\
    \ and ‘decision making’. More recent research by Shekarian and Parast [20] assess\n\
    the impact of four common resilience elements, namely: ‘ﬂexibility’, ‘agility’,\
    \ ‘redundancy’\nand ‘collaboration’ on alleviating demand, supply, process, control\
    \ and environmental\nrisks. Their ﬁndings [20] state that ‘collaboration’ is the\
    \ most important strategy to cope\nwith control disruptions, while ’ﬂexibility’\
    \ is found to be essential to mitigate demand,\nsupply, process and environmental\
    \ risks in supply chains. Conversely, Karl et al. [27]\ncategorize thirteen elements\
    \ of resilience into ‘pre-disruption’, ‘during-disruption’ and\n‘post-disruption’\
    \ phases and analyse their relationship with ten common non-ﬁnancial\nkey performance\
    \ indicators (KPI) of organizations. Using co-occurrence analysis, the\nauthors\
    \ [27] establish that ‘ﬁnancial strength’ and ‘visibility’ resilience elements\
    \ have no\nlink to any organisational KPIs, whereas, ‘knowledge management’ present\
    \ the highest\nco-occurrence with KPIs.\n3.2. Blockchain Technology\nAccording\
    \ to Yoo [72] blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that allows partic-\n\
    ipants in a network to exchange various transactional data between them. This\
    \ distributed\ndatabase maintains a constantly growing list of information records\
    \ in a decentralized way,\nforming blocks that are protected against tampering\
    \ and adjustments [72,73]. Blockchain\ntechnology is a platform on which various\
    \ services and applications can be constructed [74].\nDepending on the level of\
    \ accessibility, this platform is differentiated with public, private\nand consortium\
    \ types [75]. As the name suggests, public blockchain is a permissionless\nplatform\
    \ that is openly accessible to anyone to join the network, whereas a private type\n\
    platform requires permission from network participants to join [76]. Bitcoin and\
    \ Ethereum\nare the earliest and most widespread examples of a public type blockchain\
    \ [77,78]. A\nconsortium type blockchain is a hybrid approach of public and private\
    \ platforms where\nnetwork access is allocated to a group of pre-deﬁned members\
    \ [76,79]. Common aspects\n(or features) of blockchain technology adopted throughout\
    \ industry are ‘trust’, ‘data se-\ncurity’, ‘traceability’, ‘smart contract’,\
    \ ‘decentralization’ and ‘immutability’ [73]. Given\nthis variety of features,\
    \ extant literature claims that blockchain technology will transform\nbusinesses\
    \ and improve the integration of economic and legal processes in the digital\n\
    world [80,81]. Speciﬁcally, huge potential is anticipated in the automation of\
    \ activities that\nBuildings 2021, 11, 283\n6 of 19\nrequire disintermediation\
    \ to reduce the number of intermediaries between producer and\nconsumers during\
    \ investments made, thus offering greater security and protection against\ncybercrime\
    \ [1,82].\n4. Analysis and Findings\nNetwork maps of scientometric data generated\
    \ in VOS viewer comprise nodes sig-\nnifying different items that present an object\
    \ of interest such as publications, researchers,\ncountries or keywords [35,83,84].\
    \ Generally, a map subsumes only one type of item hence, it\nis uncommon to incorporate,\
    \ for instance, both publications and keywords in one network\nmap [48]. The size\
    \ of the network nodes conveys the numerical value of the item to be\ninvestigated:\
    \ the greater the number of certain items occurring, the bigger the nodes [48].\n\
    Relationships between those nodes are depicted through links that connect pairs\
    \ of investi-\ngated items. Links symbolize the strength or weight of a connection\
    \ and therefore, in case\nthe link between items has the strength of one, VOS\
    \ viewer does not display the strength of\nlink. Depending on the items being\
    \ presented in those nodes, the links indicates different\nconnections such as:\
    \ bibliographic coupling links between publications, co-occurrence\nlinks between\
    \ keywords or co-authorship links between researchers [48]. Similar to nodes,\n\
    each map encompasses only one type of link between any pair of items. VOS viewer\
    \ allows\nto create a citation, bibliographic coupling, keyword co-occurrence,\
    \ co-authorship and\nco-citation analysis based on bibliometric data. For this\
    \ present study citation analysis\non ‘sources’, ‘documents’ and ‘authors’ units,\
    \ along with, co-occurrence analysis on ‘all\nkeywords’ unit had been selected.\n\
    4.1. Co-Occurrence of Keywords\nVisualization of keywords in a visualisation network\
    \ provides a comprehensive\nimage of existing knowledge and signposts the direction\
    \ in which current studies are\nmoving [85,86]. The network consists of nodes\
    \ representing the volume of co-occurring\nkeywords and links portraying the weight\
    \ or number of publications in which two key-\nwords occur together. With the\
    \ purpose of achieving rich and comprehensive depiction\nof keywords in a co-occurrence\
    \ map, ‘all keywords’ was selected instead of ‘authors’ key-\nwords’, as building\
    \ a network on authors’ keywords is constrained by authors’ knowledge\nin terms\
    \ of the number/range of word selections. Therefore, selecting all keywords is\n\
    preferable approach, except for the situation when network map turns unmanageable\n\
    and illegible because of the overﬂow of dataset. The resultant network map illustrated\
    \ in\nFigure 2 consists of 4682 items, 61,338 links and 64 clusters.\nFrom the\
    \ list of keywords prior to network construction, terms ‘blockchain’, ‘blockchain\n\
    technology’, ‘supply chain’, ‘supply chain’ and ‘supply chain management’ were\
    \ purpose-\nfully eliminated from the list to improve visualisation. The network\
    \ map reveals terms\nviz. ‘internet of things’ (IoT), ‘3D printing’, ‘digital\

    \ the popularity of blockchain adoption in combination\nwith those technological\
    \ developments and its main usage in terms of tracking and tracing\nthe goods\
    \ in supply chains. All four keywords tend to occur particularly in 2018 and in\n\
    the beginning of 2019 based on the colour-coded nodes. However, most recent keywords\n\
    in bright yellow nodes exhibit the potential shift in the research focus. Speciﬁcally,\

    \ ‘carbon emission’ and\n‘sustainable supply chains’ are the most recent keywords\

    \ 35 publications (indicated in the ﬁrst section of Table 1) and 1118 citations\n\
    (in the second section of Table 1), as blockchain technology’s applications in\
    \ terms of\n‘data security’, ‘smart contracts’ and ‘distributed ledger platform’\
    \ attract more researchers\nfrom the technology ﬁeld. IEEE Access is an electronic-archival\
    \ journal published by the\nInstitute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers\
    \ that presents the results of research and\ndevelopments across electronics engineering\
    \ ﬁeld of interest [97]. Based on the network\nvisualisation map, the sources\
    \ such as ‘International Journal of Information Management’\nBuildings 2021, 11,\
    \ 283\n9 of 19\nwith 13 publications and ‘International Journal of Production\
    \ Research’ with 17 publications\nhave the most recent publications in this ﬁeld,\
    \ alongside being in the most productive top\nten journals list.\nThe most proliﬁc\
    \ author in the ﬁeld is Li, Z. with 10 papers, followed by Choi, T. and\nWang,\
    \ Y. with 9 papers in the ﬁeld. Li, Z. is an academic from Guangdong University\
    \ of\nTechnology in China, renowned in Engineering, Computer Science and Social\
    \ Sciences\nsubject areas. Three of Li’s papers are on the traceability aspect\
    \ of blockchain technology in\nfood supply chains, while six other publications\
    \ are a combination of different blockchain\ntechnology applications in industry\
    \ and service. From the top ten list of authors with\nthe most publications, Li,\

    \ review of blockchain adoption in food supply chains and offers four beneﬁts\n\
    and ﬁve associated challenges of blockchain adoption in this sector [73]. The\
    \ four main\nbeneﬁts of blockchain technology adoption were: ‘food traceability’;\
    \ ‘recall efﬁciency’;\n‘information transparency’; ‘efﬁciency combined with IoT’\
    \ while barriers to adoption\nwere listed as: ‘lack of deeper understanding of\
    \ blockchain’; ‘raw data manipulation’;\n‘getting all stakeholders’; ‘buy-in unanimously’;\
    \ ‘deﬁciency of regulation’ and ‘technology\ndifﬁculties’ [73]. In terms of highly\
    \ cited documents in the ﬁeld, an article by Mengelkamp\net al. [87] prevails\
    \ placing all six authors (namely: Mengelkamp, E., Kessler, S., Gärttner,\nJ.,\
    \ Orsini, L., Rock, K. and Weinhardt, C.) fourth after Tian, F. with 643 citations,\
    \ Sarkis, J.\nwith 511 citations and Kouhizadeh, M. with 488 citations. Tian,\
    \ F. has only two articles in\nthe ﬁeld in 2016 and 2017, both of which are frequently\
    \ cited by other academics. Both\nstudies are on applications of blockchain traceability\
    \ feature in combination with IoT and\nRFID in food supply chains. In contrast,\
    \ the study by Mengelkamp et al. [87] is conducted\nin blockchain based local\
    \ energy trading. This case-study based research [87] concludes\nthat blockchain\
    \ technology is appropriate to operate in a decentralized microgrid energy\nmarket,\
    \ as it meets their seven identiﬁed market components delineated upon in their\n\
    study’s framework.\n4.3. Findings from Grounded Theory Analysis\nBased on extensive\
    \ manual screening of topics and abstracts mined from Scopus\nin thematic analysis,\
    \ the ﬁeld of blockchain technology in supply chains generated six\nthematic clusters\
    \ as illustrated in the Figure 3. Emergent themes of ‘case study’, ‘challenges\n\
    and opportunity’, ‘traceability’, ‘smart contract’, ‘blockchain and IoT’ and ‘data\
    \ security’\nhave been observed. The graph demonstrates a trend of publications\
    \ in each cluster\nrespectively which covers a timespan from 2016 and 2020.\n\
    In order to maintain consistency between the aim of this study and processes taken\
    \ to\nachieve them, the ‘case study’ (with 89 papers) and ‘data security’ (with\
    \ 27 papers) thematic\ngroups were selected to study in grounded theory analysis;\
    \ albeit, only the case study\ncluster was analysed further for this present research.\
    \ During the analysis of the ‘case study’\ncluster publications in NVivo, 19 nodes\
    \ emerged to be nascent concepts in the initial open-\ncoding stage. As a result\
    \ of iterative subsequent coding stages, concepts were aggregated\ninto categories.\
    \ Consequently, three main categories of ‘case studies’, ‘application of\nblockchain\
    \ with other technologies’ and ‘blockchain technology in different industries’\n\
    were generated. In the ‘case study’ category different examples of blockchain\
    \ project\n(e.g., credit evaluation system [10]; tracking system for medicine\
    \ traceability [79]; carbon\ntrading, tracking [98]) in different industries (e.g.,\
    \ food supply chains, pharmaceutical,\nshipping, construction and oil gas) were\
    \ identiﬁed. Some of the examples were case\nstudies and pilot projects and others\
    \ were various use cases that could be adopted as\nproof of concepts that required\
    \ further development and testing. Concepts such as ‘trust’,\n‘traceability’,\
    \ ‘cybersecurity’, ‘smart contract’ and ‘distributed ledger technology’ were\n\
    developing from the analysis to be the main features of blockchain technology.\
    \ Further, all\nidentiﬁed concepts and categories were analysed in cluster analysis\
    \ (refer to Figure 4).\nBuildings 2021, 11, 283\n10 of 19\nBuildings 2021, 11,\

    The ﬁndings of this present study suggest that the ﬁeld of blockchain technology\n\
    remains embryonic and yet, the ﬁeld is also rapidly evolving to meet societal,\
    \ economic\nand political needs. However, despite several introduced proposals\
    \ and use cases by\nresearchers cf. [1,10,100,112,115,116] there is still a notable\
    \ deﬁciency of applications of\nblockchain technology in supply chains in real\
    \ world contexts. Moreover, most use cases\nlack standard methods to design and\
    \ consequently validate the blockchain solutions [112].\nAccording to Deloitte\
    \ Insights [117] only 8% of blockchain projects are continued, whereas\nthe remaining\
    \ initiatives tend to fail. This failure can perhaps be attributed to users (rather\n\
    than organizations) who are developing stand-alone blockchain applications instead\
    \ of\nfoundational libraries that allow to create multiple applications [117].\
    \ Additionally, projects\ninitiated by commercial organizations tend to have higher\
    \ adoption rates compared to\nusers’ developments, as organizational blockchain\
    \ projects are reportedly ﬁve times more\nlikely to be copied [117]. This present\
    \ study also reveals the latest trends and potential gaps\nwithin this systematic\
    \ literature review that employed meta-analysis, thematical analysis\nand grounded\
    \ theory analysis methods. The much-needed clarity provided by this present\n\
    study will enable both researchers and practitioners to review the blockchain\
    \ technology\nlandscape and better understand developments in this ﬁeld. Moreover,\
    \ contributions of\nthe present study can be recognised by achievement of aims\
    \ and objectives delineated at\nthe outset of this work, but also by practical\
    \ implications in the form of cyber threat map\nand guidance note that elucidates\
    \ upon requirements for both software developers and\nvendors. Different perspectives\
    \ are provided about the value of this technology, not only\nto improve trust,\
    \ time and cost effectiveness, but also to augment the overall SCR in the\ntimes\
    \ of internal or external disruptions.\nHowever, all indicated contributions carry\
    \ some constraints and limitations that\nmust be considered further. The guidance\
    \ framework provided for adopters and vendors\nrepresent an indicative list of\
    \ guidance and is by no means exhaustive. This list of guidance\nmust be expanded\
    \ in scope and enriched with more insights from applications of blockchain\ntechnology\
    \ in real-world contexts; such work would expand upon the academic research\n\
    literature studied in this paper—some of which may be based on pure theory not\
    \ practice.\nWith a substantial number of case studies in the ﬁeld, studying the\
    \ impact of each speciﬁc\napplications of blockchain technology (such as smart\
    \ contract, traceability systems or DLT)\non each resilience metrics could provide\
    \ greater insights for practitioners and create new\ndirections for enthusiastic\
    \ researchers. Furthermore, solutions indicated in the cyber threat\nmap are exclusively\
    \ based on current tools and technologies used to prevent, detect or\nremediate\
    \ the aftermath of disruption: the map does not cover available frameworks or\n\
    standards to manage the risk and threat of cyber-attack occurrences.\nDespite\
    \ the initial precautious hype about blockchain technology with its introduction\n\
    in cryptocurrency (speciﬁcally within the ﬁnancial sector), its various applications\
    \ with\npromising features became the reason for its proliferation. On the contrary,\
    \ banks, insurers\nand brokerages have started to actively test ways of harnessing\
    \ its merits. Because regu-\nlators have not yet determined certain standards\
    \ around utilization of blockchain-based\nsystems, (which is one of the challenges\
    \ of blockchain adoption) this initial interest by\nﬁnancial sector could serve\
    \ as a starting point for policymakers to develop and apply\nformal regulations.\
    \ Currently the International Organization for Standardization (ISO)\nis developing\
    \ the ISO/TC307 standard that will contribute towards establishing market\nconﬁdence\
    \ and augment proper adoption of the technology [118]. However, there remains\n\
    a caveat to blind widespread adoption of blockchain technology, as the most common\n\
    reason of technology adoption projects’ failure tends to occur because of the\
    \ misﬁt be-\ntween organisational requirements and technological proposition.\
    \ Therefore, for successful\nBuildings 2021, 11, 283\n15 of 19\nblockchain technology\
    \ adoption, adopters should rigorously ascertain their own needs\nﬁrst, then identify\
    \ their functional and non-functional requirements from this technology.\nIn conclusion,\
    \ as with every technological adoption, the main point to consider is that any\n\
    technology is merely an enabler and not the panacea to a problem that organizations\
    \ hope\nto tackle. Therefore, other organisational aspects such as processes and\
    \ particularly people\nmust be considered, as staff resistance to changes implemented\
    \ is another reason of most\nproject failures. This aspect is particularly pivotal\
    \ in blockchain adoption, as its merits\ncan be leveraged only when multiple stakeholders\
    \ implement collectively. Otherwise,\ninteroperability of different blockchain\
    \ applications could be another difﬁculty they face.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization,\

    Abstract: Smart farming is a development that has emphasized information and communication

    technology used in machinery, equipment, and sensors in network-based hi-tech
    farm supervision

    cycles. Innovative technologies, the Internet of Things (IoT), and cloud computing
    are anticipated

    to inspire growth and initiate the use of robots and artiﬁcial intelligence in
    farming. Such ground-

    breaking deviations are unsettling current agriculture approaches, while also
    presenting a range of

    challenges. This paper investigates the tools and equipment used in applications
    of wireless sensors

    in IoT agriculture, and the anticipated challenges faced when merging technology
    with conventional

    farming activities. Furthermore, this technical knowledge is helpful to growers
    during crop periods

    from sowing to harvest; and applications in both packing and transport are also
    investigated.

    1. Introduction

    Sustainable agriculture is a measure of the endurance and sustenance of food grains

    produced in an eco-friendly manner [1]. Sustainable agriculture helps in the encourage-

    ment of farming practices and approaches to help sustain farmers and resources.
    It is

    economically feasible and maintains soil quality, reduces soil degradation, saves
    water

    resources, improves land biodiversity, and ensures a natural and healthy environment
    [2].

    Sustainable agriculture plays a signiﬁcant role in preserving natural resources,
    halting

    biodiversity loss, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions [3].

    Sustainable agriculture farming is a method of preserving nature without compromis-

    ing the future generation’s basic needs, whilst also improving the effectiveness
    of farming.

    The basic accomplishments of smart farming in terms of sustainable agriculture
    are crop ro-

    tation, the control of nutrient deﬁciency in crops, the control of pests and diseases,
    recycling,

    and water harvesting, leading to an overall safer environment. Living organisms
    depend

    on the nature of biodiversity, and are contaminated by waste emissions, the use
    of fertilizers

    and pesticides, degraded dead plants, etc. The emission of greenhouse gases affects
    plants,

    animals, humans, and the environment; hence, it necessitates a better environment
    for

    living things [4] (Figure 1).

    Agriculture is the largest contributor in India, with an 18% gross domestic product

    involving approximately 57% of people in rural areas. Over the years, although
    India’s

    total agronomic output has increased, the number of growers has fallen from 71.9%
    in 1951

    to 45.1% in 2011 [5]. The Economic Survey 2018 revealed that the number of agricultural

    workers in the total workforce will drop to 25.7% in 2050. In rural areas, farming
    families

    gradually lose the next generation of farmers, overwhelmed by higher costs of
    cultivation,

    low per capita productivity, inadequate soil maintenance, and migrations to a
    non-farming

    or higher remunerative occupation. Presently, the world is on the verge of a digital

    revolution, and so it is the appropriate time to connect the agricultural landform
    with

    wireless technology to introduce and accommodate digital connectivity with farmers.

    Figure 1. Factors of sustainable agriculture.

    Regrettably, not all parts of the Earth’s surface are suitable for agriculture
    due to

    various restrictions, such as: soil quality, topography, temperature, climate,
    and most

    relevant cultivable areas are also not homogenous [6]. Further, existing farming
    land is

    fragmented by political and ﬁscal features, and rapid urbanization, which consistently

    increases pressure on arable land availability (Figure 2). Recently, total agricultural
    land

    used for food production has declined [7]. Furthermore, every crop ﬁeld has different

    critical characteristics, such as soil type, ﬂow of irrigation, presence of nutrients,
    and pest

    resistance, which are all measured separately both in quality and quantity regarding
    a

    speciﬁc crop. Both spatial and temporal differences are necessary for optimizing
    crop

    production in the same ﬁeld by crop rotation and an annual crop growth development

    cycle [8].

    Figure 2. Key issues of technology in the agriculture industry.

    In most cases, variations in characteristics occur within a single crop, or the
    same

    crop is grown on the whole farm and requires site-speciﬁc analyses for optimum
    yield

    production. New technology-based approaches are needed to produce more from less
    land,

    and to address these various issues. In traditional farming practices, farmers
    frequently

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    3 of 26

    visit their ﬁelds throughout the crop’s life in routine farming activities to
    better understand

    the crop conditions [9]. The current sensor and communication technologies offer
    an precise

    view of the ﬁeld, from which farmers can detect ongoing ﬁeld activities without
    being in

    the ﬁeld in person. Wireless sensors monitor the crops with higher accuracy and
    detect

    issues at early stages, often facilitating the use of smart tools from initial
    sowing to the

    harvest of crops [10].

    The timely use of sensors has made the entire farming operation smart and cost-

    effective, due to precise monitoring. The various autonomous harvesters, robotic
    weeders,

    and drones have sensors attached to collect data over short intervals. However,
    the vastness

    of agriculture puts extreme demands on technological solutions for sustainability
    with

    minimum ecological impact. Sensor technology through wireless communication helps

    farmers to know the various needs and requirements of crops without being in the
    ﬁelds,

    and they are then able to take remote action [11].

    2. Smart Farming

    Historically, ancient agriculture practices were related to the production of
    food in

    cultivated lands for the survival of humans and the breeding of animals [12],
    and was

    called the traditional agricultural era 1.0. This mainly resorted to using manpower
    and

    animals. Simple tools were used for farming activities, such as sickles and shovels.
    Work

    was mainly conducted through manual labor, and subsequently, productivity continued
    at

    a low level (Figure 3).

    Figure 3. Agricultural decision support system framework.

    During the 19th Century, new types of machinery appeared in the agricultural indus-

    tries, in the form of steam engines. The wide use of agricultural machinery and
    abundant

    chemicals by farmers signaled the start of the agricultural era 2.0, and outwardly
    improved

    effectiveness and productivity of farmers and farms. However, considerably harmful
    impli-

    cations, such as chemical pollution, environmental devastation, waste of natural
    resources,

    and excess utilization of energy, simultaneously developed.

    The agricultural era 3.0 emerged during the 20th Century, due to the rapid growth
    of

    computation and electronics. Robotic techniques, programed agricultural machinery,
    and

    other technologies enhanced the agricultural processes efﬁciently. The issues
    that had arisen

    during agricultural era 2.0 were solved, and policies were readapted to the agricultural
    era

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    4 of 26

    3.0 through work distribution, precise irrigation, the reduced use of chemicals,
    site-speciﬁc

    nutrient application, and efﬁcient pest control technologies, etc.

    The next agricultural era is also the current iteration of agriculture, the agricultural

    era 4.0, involving the engagement of recent technologies, such as the Internet
    of Things, big

    data analysis, artiﬁcial intelligence, cloud computing and remote sensing, etc.
    The adop-

    tion of new technologies has signiﬁcantly improved agricultural activities by
    developing

    low-cost sensor and network platforms, aimed towards the optimization of production

    efﬁciency, along with reductions in the usage of water resources and energy with
    minimum

    environmental effects [13]. Big data in smart farming provides extrapolative overviews
    of

    real-time agricultural situations, allowing farmers to make effective decisions
    [14]. Real-

    time programming is developed with artiﬁcial intelligence concepts and embedded
    in IoT

    devices, helping farmers make the most suitable decisions [15].

    Smart farming promotes precision agriculture with modern, sophisticated technology

    and enables farmers to remotely monitor the plants. Smart farming helps agricultural
    pro-

    cesses, such as harvesting and crop yields, as the automation of sensors and machinery
    has

    made the farming workforce more efﬁcient [16]. The technologies convert traditional
    farm-

    ing methods to automatic devices, causing a technological revolution in agriculture.
    Today,

    the technology in agriculture has altered the way farming is conducted, and conventional

    techniques have been transformed by the Internet of Things [17].

    In terms of optimizing farm labor requirements and increasing the quantity and

    quality of products, smart farming is an emerging modern technique implemented
    with

    information and communication technologies (ICT) [16]. Modern ICT technologies,
    such

    as the Internet of Things, GPS (Global Positioning Systems), sensors, robotics,
    drones,

    precision equipment, actuators, and data analytics, are used to identify the farmers’
    needs

    and select suitable solutions to their problems. These innovations increase the
    accuracy

    and timeliness of decisions taken, and improve crop productivity. Several multilateral

    organizations and developing countries around the world have proposed smart farming

    technologies to increase agricultural output [18].

    Sensors are constantly monitoring crops with greater accuracy, detecting any undesir-

    able conditions during the early stages of the crop’s lifecycle. Current farming
    incorporates

    smart tools from crop sowing to harvest, storing, and conveyance. The appropriate
    use of a

    wide variety of sensors has made the entire operation both more efﬁcient and proﬁtable,

    due to its accurate monitoring competencies. In addition, sensors that collect
    data quickly

    are directly available online for further evaluation, and they provide crop and
    site-speciﬁc

    agriculture for every site.

    The many issues related to crop production are addressed by smart agriculture
    and

    monitoring, particularly regarding changes in soil characteristics, climate factors,
    soil mois-

    ture, etc., to improve the spatial management practices that increase crop production
    and

    avoid the excess use of fertilizers and pesticides [19]. The ANN models in smart
    irrigation

    water management (SIWM) regulate irrigation scheduling support systems (DSS) and
    offer

    data on irrigation efﬁciency, water productivity index, and irrigation water demand
    and

    supply on a real-time basis. Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) is an upcoming technology,

    especially in developing countries, due to its potential to improve food security,
    farm

    system resilience, and lower greenhouse gas emissions [20]. Smart agriculture
    technology

    based on IoT technologies has many advantages in all agricultural processes and
    practices

    in real-time, including irrigation, plant protection, improving product quality,
    fertilization,

    disease prediction, etc. [21]. The beneﬁt of smart agriculture lies in its collection
    of real-time

    data on crops, the precise assessment of soil and crops, remote monitoring by
    farmers,

    supervising water and other natural resources, and improving livestock and agricultural

    production. Therefore, smart agriculture is considered to be the progression of
    precision

    agriculture through modernization and smart methods to attain various information
    of

    farm activities that are then remotely managed, and reinforced by suitable alternative

    real-time farm maintenance solutions.

    3. Internet of Things

    The Internet of Things (IoT) is a new technology that allows devices to connect

    remotely to achieve smart farming [22]. The IoT has begun to inﬂuence a vast range

    of industries, from health, trade, communications, energy and agriculture, to
    enhance

    efﬁciency and performance across all markets [23–25].

    Current applications provide information on the IoT’s effects, and its practices
    that are

    yet to be observed. However, by considering the advancement of technologies, one
    can

    envisage the IoT technologies perform a crucial role in numerous activities of
    farming, such

    as the utilization of communication infrastructure, data acquisition, smart objects,
    sensors,

    mobile devices, cloud-based intelligent information, decision-making, and the
    automation

    of agricultural operations (Figure 4).

    Figure 4. Barriers in the implementation of smart agriculture technology.

    The IoT technology monitors plants and animals and remotely retrieves information

    from mobile phones and devices. Sensors and instruments empower farmers to assess

    the weather and to anticipate production levels. The IoT plays a role in water
    harvesting,

    monitoring and controlling the ﬂow amount, assessing crops’ water requirements,
    time of

    supply, and the saving of water, more than ever before [26]. Sensors and cloud
    connectivity

    through the gateway can remotely monitor the status and water supply based on
    soil

    and plant needs [27]. To correct nutrient deﬁciencies, pests, and diseases, farmers
    cannot

    monitor and observe every plant manually, but IoT technology is still beneﬁcial
    and has

    led farmers to a new milestone in modern agriculture [28].

    Recently, the development of IoT technologies has played a major role throughout
    the

    farming sector, particularly through its communication infrastructure. This has
    included

    connecting smart objects, remote data acquisition, using vehicles and sensors
    through

    mobile devices and the internet, cloud-based intelligent analysis, interfacing,
    decision

    formation, and the automation of agricultural operations. These proﬁciencies have
    revo-

    lutionized the agriculture industry in terms of resource optimization, controlling
    climate

    effects, and improving crop yields.

    Researchers have proposed different methods, architectures, and various equipment
    to

    monitor and convey crop information at different growth stages, based on several
    crop and

    ﬁeld types. Many manufacturers provide communication devices, multiple sensors,
    robots,

    heavy machinery, and drones to collect and then distribute data. Food and agriculture

    organizations, along with other government organizations, develop guidelines and
    policies

    for regulating the use of technologies to preserve food and environment safety
    [29,30].

    Fundamentals of IoT Applications in Agriculture

    The accessible, inexpensive and interactive tracking platform provides consolidated

    information on traditional agricultural methods, techniques, implements, crop
    pests and

    diseases, etc., collected from various sources for sustainable agriculture. Interactive
    agricul-

    ture allows easy access to the data by users through multiple devices, such as
    computers

    and mobile phones [31].

    1.

    Robust Models: The distinctive features of the agriculture sector are diversity,
    com-

    plexity, spatio-temporal variability, and uncertainties of the right types of
    harvests

    and facilities.

    2.

    Scalability: The variation in farm size from smaller to larger; hence, the results
    should

    be scalable. The placement and testing planning should be progressively scaled
    up

    with fewer expenses.

    3.

    Affordability: Affordability is vital to farming achievement, and therefore price
    should

    be suitable with signiﬁcant assistance. Standardized platforms, products, tools,
    and

    facilities could obtain a satisfactory price.

    4.

    Sustainability: The problem of sustainability is a vital issue due to strong economic

    pressure and intense competition worldwide.

    4. Technologies Used in Smart Farming

    4.1. Global Positioning System (GPS)

    GPS accurately records latitude, longitude, and elevation information [32]. Global

    Positioning System satellites transmit signals and permit GPS receivers to compute
    their

    location in real-time, and provide continuous positions while moving. The exact
    location

    information offers farmers the opportunity to discover the precise position of
    ﬁeld data,

    such as pest occurrence, type of soil, weeds, and other barriers. The system facilitates
    the

    recognition of various ﬁeld locations in order to then apply the necessary inputs
    (seed,

    fertilizer, herbicide, pesticide, and water) to a particular ﬁeld [33].

    4.2. Sensor Technologies

    Technics, such as photo electricity, electromagnetics, conductivity, and ultrasound,
    are

    used to estimate soil texture and structure, nutrient level, vegetation, humidity,
    vapor, air,

    temperature, etc. Remote sensing data can differentiate between crop types, categorize

    pests and weeds, locate stress in soil and plant conditions, and monitor drought
    [34].

    Plant health is affected by many factors, such as soil moisture, nutrient availability,

    exposure to light, humidity, the amount of rainfall, the color of leaves, etc.
    The plants are

    monitored by maintaining the optimum temperature and light intensity, and conserving

    water and energy through micro-irrigation. Different sensors are used to detect
    many

    parameters. If they cross a threshold, the sensor senses the changes and transmits
    them

    to the microcontroller to perform the required actions until the parameter returns
    to its

    optimum level [1].

    The temperature, humidity, soil pattern monitoring, airﬂow sensor, location, CO2,

    pressure, light, and moisture sensors are generally used in sensing technologies.
    Prominent

    sensor characteristics include reliability, memory, portability, durability, coverage,
    and

    computational efﬁciency, and make them suitable for agriculture [35]. Currently
    available

    wireless sensors play a vital role in collecting data on crop conditions and providing
    other

    information. These sensors are standalone types and can be integrated with advanced

    agricultural tools and heavy machinery, based on application necessities.

    The major sensor types with their corresponding working procedure and purpose
    are

    represented in Table 1.

    [57].

    4.3. Variable-Rate of Technology (VRT) and Grid Soil Sampling

    Variable-rate technologies (VRT) are used in farming to predict the delivery rate
    of

    inputs based on a predetermined map extrapolated from GIS for the placement of
    inputs at

    variable amounts in the right place and at the right time [16,33]. Grid soil sampling
    is soil

    collection from a systematic grid to establish a map for every parameter. These
    maps are

    the basis for VRT and are loaded into a variable-rate applicator. The computer
    and GPS

    receiver direct and control the changes in the delivery amount or fertilizer product,
    based

    on map features [58,59].

    New technologies, such as variable rate technology and associated practices (grid
    soil

    sampling), potentially improve soil fertility management and assess the spatial
    distribution

    of nutrients and yields [60]. In grid sampling, samples are collected from sampled
    sections

    based on the subdivision of a ﬁeld into small areas, or cells, by superimposing
    the grid

    lines onto the ﬁeld. Composite samples represent an entire area of each much smaller
    area

    (grid-point sampling) at the intersections of grid lines. Soil-test values from
    grid sampling

    are mapped by interpolating methods from non-measured locations between sampled

    points. The variability of phosphorus and potassium is ﬁeld-speciﬁc, and each
    ﬁeld should

    be fertilized differently to improve nutrient management practices by uniform
    applications

    of fertilizers and manure for better precision agriculture [61].

    4.4. Geographic Information System (GIS)

    The GIS comprises hardware and software designed to provide compilation, storage,

    retrieval, attributes analysis, and location data to generate maps and analyze
    characters and

    geography for statistics and spatial methods [62]. The GIS database provides information

    on ﬁeld soil types, nutrient status, topography, irrigation, surface and subsurface
    drainage,

    quantity of chemical applications, and crop production, and also establishes the
    relationship

    between elements that affect a crop on a particular farming ﬁeld [63]. Apart from
    data

    storage and display, the GIS is used to assess present and alternative management
    by

    compounding and altering data layers for decision-making.

    4.5. Crop Management

    Satellite images provide information on variations in soil conditions, as well
    as crop

    performances affected by topography within the ﬁeld. Therefore, farmers can exactly

    monitor production factors, such as seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides, that are
    responsible

    for yield increase and efﬁciency.

    The spatial coverage and temporal revisit frequency of satellite images provide
    the

    information in near real-time at a regional scale. The relationship between the
    spectral prop-

    erties of crops and their biomass/yield experiments [64] is predicted by spectral
    reﬂectance

    properties of vegetation, especially in red and near-infrared combinations (vegetation

    indices) to monitor green foliage. Among the different indices, the normalized
    difference

    vegetation index (NDVI) is the most popular indicator to assess vegetation health
    and crop

    production, due to the closely related leaf area index (LAI) and photosynthetic
    activity

    of green vegetation [25]. Crop monitoring methods are based on the interpretation
    of

    remote-sensing-derived indicators by comparing actual crop status to previous
    or normal

    seasons [65]. The relationship between vegetation indices and biomass permits
    early crop

    yield estimation in certain periods before harvest [66]. The automated data acquisition,
    pro-

    cessing, monitoring, decision-making, and management of farm operations [67],
    including

    the basic functions of crop production (yields), proﬁts and losses, farm weather
    prediction,

    ﬁeld mapping, soil nutrients tracking, are the more complicated functionalities
    available

    through automated ﬁeld management.

    4.6. Soil and Plant Sensors

    Sensor technology, a signiﬁcant constituent of precision agriculture, provides
    soil

    properties information, fertility, and water status. Hence, new sensors have been
    developed

    based on desirable features and established apart from currently available sensors
    [68].

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    9 of 26

    Soil sensors and plant wearables monitor real-time physical and chemical signals

    in soil, such as moisture, pH, temperature, and pollutants, and provide information
    to

    optimize crop growth conditions, ﬁght against biotic and abiotic stresses, and
    increase

    crop yields. Soil organic matters (SOMs), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium

    (K) are the most important nutrients for crop production. The NIR reﬂectance-based

    sensors measure the spatial variation of surface and subsurface soil nitrogen
    [69]. SOM is

    predicted based on optimal wavelengths by assessing soil spectral reﬂectance in
    IR and

    visible wavelength regions [70]. The soil nitrogen and phosphorus are predicted
    using

    NIR spectrophotometry technology [71–73]. The soil apparent electrical conductivity
    (ECa)

    sensors collect information continuously on the ﬁeld surface, since ECa is sensitive
    to

    changes in soil texture and salinity. Soil insects/pests are detected using optoelectronic,

    acoustic, impedance sensors, and nanostructured biosensors [74].

    4.7. Rate Controllers

    Rate controllers are designed to control the delivery rate of inputs by monitoring
    the

    speed of vehicles across the ﬁeld, and altering the ﬂow rate of material on a
    real-time basis

    at the target rate. Rate controllers are commonly used as stand-alone systems
    [75].

    4.8. Precision Irrigation in Pressurized Systems

    Recent developments in irrigation systems have introduced irrigation machines,
    de-

    voted to motion control, GPS-based controllers, sensor technologies, and wireless
    commu-

    nication to monitor soil and climatic conditions together with an assessment of
    irrigation

    parameters, i.e., ﬂow and pressure, to attain greater water utilization efﬁciency
    by crop.

    These technologies show signiﬁcant potential; however, further progress is required
    before

    they can become commercially available [76].

    4.9. Yield Monitor

    Yield monitors are the combination of sensors and components, including a data

    storage device, a computer, and user interface, that control integration and interaction

    components. The sensor measures yield continuously by evaluating the force of
    mass or

    volume of grain ﬂow. The mass ﬂow sensor was based on the principle of transmitting

    microwave energy beams and measuring the energy that bounces back after hitting.
    In

    yield monitors, GPS receivers create yield maps based on the location yield data
    [77].

    The yield monitor is mounted on a harvester and connected with the mobile app
    for

    displaying live harvest data, and automatically uploads to the web-based platform.
    The

    app can generate and share high-quality yield maps with an agronomist, and farmers

    can export other farm management data for analysis. In horticultural crops, to
    precisely

    determine the yield quantity and quality of produce, fruit growth is considered
    one of

    the most relevant parameters in the crop progressing period [78]. Color images
    are used

    to track fruit conditions for estimating fruit maturation, making decisions for
    harvesting,

    and targeting the right market [79]. Satellite images are one of the options for
    real-time

    monitoring of the yield of crops over vast areas; for example, Sentinel-1A images
    are used

    to map the rice yield and crop intensity in Myanmar [80].

    The crop yield estimation system was designed using both software and hardware

    components. Based on a Bluetooth terminal android application and yield estimator

    software program, crop yield is estimated using a mathematical calculation through
    a

    mobile application [81]. Satellite-based crop yield predictions based on spectral
    signatures

    reveal the estimated yields are as reliable as actual yields. The maize yield
    predictions

    were successfully carried out under varying environments using machine learning
    and

    satellite-derived data assimilation in crop models [82].

    4.10. Software

    The software has multiple tasks, such as mapping, display controller interfacing,
    data

    processing, analysis, and interpretation, etc. Most commonly, software is used
    to generate

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    10 of 26

    the maps for soil properties and nutrient status, yield maps, variable rate applications

    maps for inputs, and overlaying different kinds of maps with advanced geostatistical

    features [83].

    5. Applications in Agriculture

    By adopting the current sensor and IoT technologies in agriculture, each characteristic

    of conventional farming practices is rehabilitated. The incorporation of wireless
    sensors

    and IoT in smart farming answers many of the issues facing conventional agriculture;
    for

    example, land suitability, drought monitoring, irrigation, pest control, and yield
    maximiza-

    tion. Figure 5 demonstrates the order of main applications, facilities, and devices
    for smart

    agriculture applications. Using advanced technologies at various stages in the
    following

    few applications enhances efﬁciency and revolutionizes agriculture.

    Figure 5. Hierarchy of probable applications, facilities and devices for smart
    agriculture.

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    11 of 26

    5.1. Soil Mapping and Plant Monitoring

    Soil analysis estimates the nutrient status of the ﬁeld based on GPS position
    and

    ﬁeld-speciﬁc information, and critical decisions are then taken according to the
    nutrient

    deﬁciencies at different stages of the crop. The factors controlling soil fertility
    status are

    topography, type and texture, cropping pattern, application of fertilizer, irrigation,
    etc. [84].

    Soil mapping is useful for assessing crop suitability or varieties in a speciﬁc
    ﬁeld, as well

    as planting depth, the physical, chemical and biological properties of soil, in
    order to

    best utilize resources. Presently, a wide range of sensors and tools are used
    to monitor

    soil properties, such as water-holding capacity, texture, and absorption rate,
    which assists

    farmers in tracking the soil quality and adopting suitable remedies to avoid soil
    degradation

    such as erosion, alkalization, acidiﬁcation, salinization, and pollution. Drought
    is another

    concern that affects plant productivity and crop yield. Remote sensing techniques
    that

    can obtain soil moisture data frequently assist in analyzing agricultural drought
    in remote

    regions. Soil moisture maps generated from satellite data are used to estimate
    the soil water

    deﬁcit index (SWDI), which enables the development of prediction models based
    on soil

    physical properties [85,86].

    Various factors, such as soil type, soil nutrients, irrigation, and pests, affect
    rice yield

    and quality. The IoT-based mobile application aids crop management and provides
    real-

    time information on soil nutrition and characteristics. The system consists of
    electrical

    conductivity (EC), temperature sensors with a T-Beam microcontroller, and IoT
    connectivity,

    and the estimated EC value near the calibration solution is 12.88 mS/cm, and 150
    mS/cm

    is less than 2% of the calibration solution’s value. The measured EC values are
    linearly

    proportional to temperature and depth, and values of 1.04 and 3.86 mS/cm were
    noticed

    with and without fertilizer at 5 cm depth, while it was 0.656 and 420 mS/cm at
    10 cm depth,

    respectively [87].

    Plant monitoring conducted through the IoT ADCON-based station, with sensors

    and mobile devices (smartphones and tablets), farmers are able to collect data
    on soil and

    ambient parameters, such as leaf wetness, air and soil temperature, soil and air
    humidity to

    improve the grape productivity, and crop quality from seeding to harvest. Further,
    the data

    transmission system highlights the soil-plant-atmosphere interactions needed to
    optimize

    agricultural production [88]. By analyzing the data from soil moisture, carbon
    dioxide,

    light, and temperature sensors in bell peppers grown in a greenhouse were compared
    with

    day and night CO2, rolling the doors and windows of the greenhouse open and closed,

    based on soil moisture [89].

    5.2. Irrigation

    According to the UN Convention to Combat Desertiﬁcation (UNCCD), 168 countries

    will be inundated with desertiﬁcation by 2030, and nearly 50% of the world population

    lives in high water shortage areas [90]. Considering the water crises and increasing
    demand

    for farming and other activities, it must be provided to regions with water quantities.
    Water

    resources are conserved by adopting more controlled and efﬁcient irrigation systems;
    for

    example, drip and sprinkler irrigations. Water demand estimation for crops is
    controlled

    by soil type, precipitation, irrigation method, crop type, and requirement, as
    well as soil

    moisture retention. Using air and soil moisture control systems with wireless
    sensors

    optimizes water resources and improves crop health. In the current scenario, a
    substantial

    increase in crop productivity is anticipated using IoT techniques, namely CWSI
    (crop water

    stress index)-based water management [91], calculated from the crop canopy at
    varying

    crop growth stages and air temperatures. The information from climate data, sensors,
    and

    satellite imaging are related to the CWSI model for water requirement calculation,
    and

    predictions using the irrigation index values can be used for every ﬁeld based
    on slope or

    soil variability to improve water usage efﬁciency.

    12 of 26

    5.3. Site-Speciﬁc Nutrient Management

    Fertilizer is a either natural or synthetic chemical substance that provides nutrients
    for

    plant growth and soil fertility. Both nutrient deﬁciency and excessive fertilizer
    use harms

    soil, plant health, and the environment [92]. The site-speciﬁc soil nutrient fertilization
    under

    smart agriculture estimates the required quantity of nutrients precisely, and
    minimizes

    their negative effects through excessive use on soil and in the environment. The
    site-

    speciﬁc soil, nutrient measurements are inﬂuenced by soil types, crop type, yield
    targets,

    exchange capacity, use efﬁciency, the type of fertilizer, weather conditions,
    etc. The IoT-

    based fertilizing technique estimates the nutrient’s spatial patterns of distribution
    [93,94].

    The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was obtained from satellite
    images to

    observe crop nutrient status [95,96], crop health, vegetation vigor, and plant
    density, as well

    as soil nutrient level. Recent technologies, like GPS [97], geo mapping [98],
    variable rate

    technology (VRT) [99,100], and autonomous vehicles [101] strongly contribute to
    IoT-based

    smart fertilization. Apart from these, fertigation [102] and chemigation [103,104],
    i.e., the

    use of water-soluble fertilizers in soil amendments and pesticides, are considered
    effective

    management practices to improve fertilization efﬁciency.

    5.4. Crop Pest and Disease Management

    The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) concluded that an annual global crop

    yield loss of 20- 40% was only due to pests and diseases [105], and these losses
    are controlled

    by the use of pesticides and other agrochemicals [106]. Most of them are harmful
    to human

    and animal health, and ultimately cause contamination of environmental systems
    [107,108].

    The IoT-based devices, such as robots, wireless sensors, and drones, precisely
    spot and

    control the crop opponents by real-time monitoring, modelling, and disease forecasting,

    increasing overall effectiveness [109,110] more than traditional pest control
    procedures.

    The IoT-based disease and pest management process depends on detection and image

    processing. The remote sensing imagery and ﬁeld sensors are used to collect data,
    such

    as plant health and pest incidence, in every ﬁeld for the entire crop period.
    IoT-based

    automated traps [111,112] capture, count, and describe insect types, and further
    upload

    data to the Cloud for complete analysis. Due to advancements in robotic technology,

    an agricultural robot with multispectral image sensing devices and precision spraying

    nozzles is utilized to detect and control pest problems more accurately under
    the IoT

    management system.

    5.5. Yield Monitoring and Forecasting

    The yield monitoring mechanism conforms to yield, moisture content, and quality
    of

    produce. The quality depends on pollination with good pollen, especially under
    changing

    environmental circumstances [113–115]. Crop forecasting predicts the yield before
    the crop

    harvest, and assists the farmer in future planning, decision-making, and further
    analysis of

    the yield quality. Maturity determines the right harvesting time by monitoring
    the crop at

    different development stages, including factors such as fruit color, size, etc.
    Predictions of

    the correct harvesting time aids in maximizing crop quality and production, and
    regulates

    market management strategies. Therefore, farmers should know the exact harvest
    time of

    crops to obtain proﬁt. Figure 6 outlines the idea of a farm area network, representing
    the

    whole farm in real-time conditions.

    The development and installation of a yield monitor [116] on a harvester, connected

    with a mobile app, shows real-time crop harvest, and automatically transmits data
    to

    the manufacturer’s web-based platform. To estimate crop production and monitoring,

    satellite images are exploited to cover vast areas [80]. For fruit crops, multicolor
    (RGB)

    satellite images [79] are utilized to track the diverse fruit conditions, especially
    fruit size

    and color, and plays a major role in estimating its maturation, making decisions
    on harvest,

    and market opportunities. Similarly, multiple optical sensors are used [117] to
    monitor

    shrinking fruits during drying conditions.

    6. Role of IoT in Advanced Farming Practices

    Adopting the new methods based on sensor and IoT-based technologies improved

    the yield of crops more than conventional agriculture processes. The involvement
    of new

    sophisticated sensor-based technologies in controlled environments plays an important

    role in enhancing the quality and quantity of produce.

    6.1. Greenhouse Farming and Protected Cultivation

    Growing plants in a controlled environment gained popularity in the 19th Century,

    and is considered one of the oldest methods of smart farming. These practices
    further

    accelerated during the 20th Century in countries facing severe weather conditions
    [118].

    Crops grown in indoor conditions are less affected by the environment. As a result,

    crops grown traditionally under suitable conditions are today being raised at
    anytime and

    anywhere by the use of sensors and communication devices. The success of crop
    production

    under a controlled environment depends on various factors, such as shed structures
    and

    material for controlling wind effects, aeration systems, accuracy of monitoring
    parameters,

    decision support system, etc. [119]. One of the greatest challenges in greenhouses
    is the

    precise monitoring of environmental parameters; hence, it requires several measurement

    points to predict the various parameters for controlling and ensuring the local
    climate. In

    an IoT-based greenhouse, sensors are used to measure and monitor the internal
    parameters,

    such as humidity, temperature, light, and pressure [120].

    The smart greenhouse has helped farmers automatically conduct farm work, without

    manual inspection, and protects the plants from hailstorms, winds, ultraviolet
    radiation,

    and insect and pest attacks. Hibiscus plants are grown with the required wavelength
    during

    the night using lights, temperature, and air humidity sensors. A study revealed
    a reduction

    in 70–80% water requirement, and the IoT enables direct contact between the farmer
    and

    consumer to make farming as efﬁcient and proﬁtable as possible [121]. The IoT-enabled

    automated system increased the productivity of rose plants grown in a greenhouse
    by

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    14 of 26

    monitoring and controlling various parameters, such as humidity, mist, CO2 level,
    UV light

    intensity, pH and EC value, water nutrients solution level, temperature, and amount
    of

    pesticides, through sensors for further efﬁcient detection and diagnosis [122].

    6.2. Hydroponics

    Hydroponics, a subdivision of hydroculture, is growing plants without soil to
    improve

    greenhouse farming beneﬁts. Hydroponic-based irrigation systems enable a balanced
    rate

    of application of dissolved nutrients in the water to crop roots as a solution.
    Presently,

    the available systems and sensors [123] detect a wide range of parameters and
    perform

    data analysis at predetermined intervals. Precise measurement and monitoring of
    nutrient

    content in solution is crucial for plant growth and considers its demands. On
    a real-

    time basis, the wireless-sensor-based prototype [124] has delivered a solution
    for soilless

    cultivation, and measures the concentration of numerous nutrients and water levels
    [125].

    An automated smart hydroponics system integrated with IoT consists of three major

    components: input data, cloud server and output data. These monitor lettuce cultivation

    from anywhere through the internet by analyzing parameters, such as pH level,
    water,

    nutrient-rich water-based solution, room temperature, and humidity, on a real-time
    ba-

    sis [126]. The hydroponic system of the deep ﬂow technique is a method for cultivating

    plants by placing roots in deep water layers, and ensuring the continuous circulation
    of

    plant nutrient solution. The plant growth elements data, such as pH, temperature,
    humid-

    ity, and water level in the hydroponic reservoir, are acquired by sensors integrated
    into

    Raspberry Pi, and data are processed and monitored automatically on a real-time
    basis to

    ensure proper water circulation [127].

    6.3. Vertical Farming

    The industrial-based agricultural farming practices damage soil quality at a faster

    rate than nature can reconstruct. The alarming erosion rate and use of fresh water
    for

    agriculture has led to the reduction of arable land, and increased the overburden
    on present

    water reservoirs [128]. Vertical farming (VF) offers an opportunity to keep the
    plants in a

    precisely controlled environment, signiﬁcantly reducing resource consumption and,
    at the

    same time, increasing production at varied times; and only a portion of the ground
    surface

    is needed depending on the number of stacks. VF is also extremely effective in
    higher

    yields and reducing water consumption compared to traditional farming [129]. The
    carbon

    dioxide measurement is the most critical parameter; hence, nondispersive infrared
    (NDIR)

    CO2 sensors play a vital part in tracking and controlling the conditions in vertical
    farms.

    6.4. Phenotyping

    Phenotyping is an emerging crop engineering technique, relating plant genomics
    with

    ecophysiology and agronomy. The advancement of genetic and molecular tools is
    signiﬁ-

    cant for crop breeding; however, quantitative analysis of crop behaviors, such
    as pathogen

    resistance, grain weight, etc., is inadequate due to the absence of effective
    technologies

    and efﬁcient techniques. In this condition, [130] reported that plant phenotyping
    is highly

    useful in investigating the quantitative characteristics responsible for growth,
    resistance

    to various stresses, yield quality, and quantity. The sensing technologies and
    image-based

    phenotyping describe screening of biostimulants and an understanding of their
    mode

    of action [131]. IoT-based phenotyping is intended to observe the crop and related
    trait

    measurements, and offer facilities for the breeding of crops and digital agriculture
    [132].

    The trait analysis algorithms and modelling support determine the relationships
    among

    genotypes, phenotypes, and their growing condition.

    7. The Role of the Engineer in Smart Farming

    Farmers face many issues when they adopt IoT-based agriculture. Therefore, engi-

    neers must develop solutions for speciﬁc problems related to smart farming techniques.
    An

    engineering role concerns the application and use of innovative technologies and
    methods

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    15 of 26

    for precision agricultural machinery, and smart farming is a creative way to mechanize

    agricultural engineering through means different from conventional mechanization
    [133].

    The concepts and synergy-based information are obtained from different technology
    areas,

    such as agricultural mechanization, mechatronics, instrumentation, control systems,
    and

    knowledge in artiﬁcial and computational intelligence [134]. Big data, satellite,
    and aerial

    images have revolutionized precision agriculture, and these new technologies increase

    production efﬁciency by creating a balance between productivity and environmental
    pro-

    tection. As a system integrator, engineering combines technical experience and
    strong

    business skills in both the public and private sectors [135].

    At the same time, engineering exploits the rewards of digital transformation in
    the

    entire agri-food chain, from day-to-day farming activities to supporting sales
    operations,

    logistics, and the maintenance of farm assets. For example, knowledge of the IoT,
    AI,

    mobile, precision farming technologies, remote sensing, advanced analytics, the
    Cloud,

    RPA, and blockchain technologies are necessary [136]. The data collected from
    the various

    types of machinery through sensors and other devices generates responses concerning

    cereals, viticulture, fruit, and vegetables, as well as soil and monitoring [137].

    The use of digital technologies and control systems to automate production processes

    also reduces manual human intervention. The production process, from ﬁeld to ﬁnal

    product, is carried out by planning, organizing, and analyzing data received from
    machines.

    The data acquired are stored in historical archives and correlated with each other
    to

    retrieve useful information for products through traceable systems working based
    on

    radio-frequency signals [138].

    7.1. Purpose

    Purpose is based on the user’s ﬁnal requirement, and inﬂuences the monitoring
    of

    crops during the growth period. Sensors provide the IoT solutions to their problems.

    For example, the end-user is a corn farmer, faced by problems mainly concerning
    water

    usage and ensuring that a crop gets adequate water; therefore, water level and
    moisture

    monitoring sensors are accommodated to prevent water wastage.

    7.2. Technology

    Distance plays an important role in technology selection because the sensors collect

    data and send to the server; hence, similar technology cannot be used for varying
    distances.

    For example, radio frequency identiﬁcation (RFID) or near ﬁeld communication (NFC)
    and

    low power, wide area network (LPWAN) technologies could send data over a distance
    of

    hundreds or even thousands of meters.

    7.3. Power Requirements

    Most IoT solutions are spread across a large farm, so it is better to develop
    low-

    power applications. On the other hand, more data transmission requires huge data
    costs

    and power consumption; hence, designers need to consider developing cost-effective
    IoT

    solutions for farmers. Usually, engineers save costs with customized IoT-based
    farming

    solutions, and develop apps for sending the data less frequently.

    7.4. Data Frequency

    The end user’s necessities are critical in deciding the number of sensors and
    data

    packets. Sometimes, a farmer does not require information frequently, but developer
    design

    an IoT application to function on a continual and real-time basis, with very high
    data

    frequency.

    7.5. Placement of Sensors

    Sensors are placed in such a way that they provide optimal performance, even if
    the

    farm has all the essential sensors with proper placement.

    8. Barriers to Implementing Smart Farming Technologies

    Technology adoption is a method with a certain level of heterogeneity factors
    that

    are affective [139]. Technology implemented in farming systems has provided accuracy,

    efﬁciency, and eased time pressures. Although smart farming increases the productivity
    of

    crops, there are still problems in adopting these technologies

    8.1. Cost of Technology

    Existing technologies minimize the workforce and perform extremely fast with high

    accuracy. Therefore, it is anticipated that machines would probably replace a
    human work-

    force in the near future. However, it is impossible, since many countries have
    experienced

    poverty wherever the workforce was the main source for the agriculture sector.
    The imple-

    mentation of devices and technologies requires a huge amount of money; therefore,
    farmers

    face difﬁculties in terms of affordability when they look beyond conventional
    tools.

    8.2. Lack of Financial Resources

    Financial supporters could provide adequate loans to farmers if farmers did not
    get

    the anticipated yield, perhaps because unexpected calamities like drought, ﬂood,
    pests,

    and diseases impacted the crops.

    8.3. Literacy Status of Farmers

    The education level among the farmers is one of the greater challenges in implementing

    technologies in developing countries. The knowledge needed encompasses educational
    and

    technical abilities to manage the tools. The level of education increases a farmers’
    aptitude

    to process information, and thus make decisions using smart farming technologies
    [140],

    facilitating farmers’ use of computers [141]. Farmers in developing nations are
    mostly

    uneducated and unskilled because of a lack of desire to gain knowledge, or any
    new

    technology awareness [142]. Hence, it is a reason for farmers in choosing traditional

    farming over smart farming [143]. Farmers have considered that usage is too complex,

    sometimes incapable of recognizing the icons used in a mobile application as the
    farmers

    use general icons based on traditional understanding. Farmers need to be digitally
    literate

    to reinforce the advantages of smart farming technologies and, simultaneously,
    agri-tech

    companies should ensure farmers easily understand the limitations of the technology.

    8.4. Lack of Integration between the Systems

    Integration across systems is one of the areas where smart farming technologies
    needs

    to be advanced further by incorporating production, property management, and decision-

    making tools. The communication between academics and interdisciplinary groups
    must

    overcome the gap between agricultural and information science. More emphasis has

    been given to increasing user effectiveness during the development of an information

    system [144]. The basis for improved decision-making is based on the timely obtain-

    ability of superior quality data; hence, data must be integrated to generate information

    and knowledge.

    8.5. Telecommunications Infrastructure

    Farming activities mostly occur in rural areas more effectively in arable land
    than

    contaminated land. However, poor telecommunication infrastructure makes data transmis-

    sion unreliable, especially through mobile phones and tablets. Smart farming necessitates

    a real-time connection with the internet to enable the use of information. In
    addition,

    various operation control systems, such as fertilizers, pesticides, and seed volume,
    requires

    high-quality internet connection to produce outcomes. Recently, with the expansion
    of

    mobile phones, rural producers have gained to access mobile internet; however,
    signal

    quality and input speed are limited.

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    17 of 26

    8.6. Data Management

    Farmers are facing problems in organizing and manipulating data obtained by the

    sensors. The weather stations are generating data; however, farmers do not recognize
    how

    to use the information and how to change the data into a more available form.
    Its complex

    systems, alongside issues of acceptability and usability, lead to incorrect calculations.

    Farmers, consultants, and others involved in the production process must provide
    greater

    accessibility to data and information in productive systems.

    9. Current Challenges and Future Expectations

    In the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the United Nations and international

    community established a goal to end hunger by 2030. Currently, the World Health
    Organi-

    zation reports that more than 800 million people are facing food shortages worldwise
    [145].

    In addition, the increasing global population is increasing the demand for quality
    food;

    therefore, food and cash crops could improve overall crop production.

    Figure 7 represents the future challenges agriculture is anticipated to face in
    2050. This

    illustration offers three major problems: (1) feeding 10 billion people, (2) limitations
    in the

    expansion of land, and (3) the reduction of greenhouse gases emissions. These
    challenges

    lead to new thinking about water scarcity, shrinking arable land, rural labor,
    climate condi-

    tions, and much more. The diminishment in rural populations due to urbanization
    is not

    only shrinking communities, but is also leading to ageing populations; therefore,
    younger

    growers must step forward to take responsibility. The generation shift and population

    imbalance create further implications for the workforce and production.

    Figure 7. Challenges in sustainable future agriculture.

    The further shrinking of arable land and the suitability of particular crops in
    speciﬁc

    regions are due to geographic and ecological conditions. Abrupt weather changes
    enhance

    the intensity of environmental issues, such as drought, groundwater depletion,
    and soil

    degradation, affecting crop production. Moreover, traditional agricultural methods
    have

    historically met food demands by employing fertilizers and pesticides; however,
    it increases

    food production only to a certain level and negligent use of chemical deteriorate
    the envi-

    ronment. In developing countries, various problems facing the agricultural sector
    include

    no suitable crop selection, soil testing, efﬁcient irrigation systems, weather
    forecasting,

    animal husbandry, etc. Technological advancements have proved beneﬁcial in developed

    countries, both quantitively and qualitatively, but, in developing countries,
    50% of the

    population is already engaged in agriculture.

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    18 of 26

    The future of agriculture is expected to interconnect with artiﬁcial intelligence
    and

    big data services. As a result, the systems will converge into a single unit,
    where farm

    machinery and management start from seeding to production forecasting. Few of
    the key

    technologies and methods are focused on achieving sustainable future agriculture.

    9.1. Communication

    The achievement of the IoT in agriculture mostly depends on connectivity between

    devices [146]. Most telecom operators provide connectivity services, but represent
    a small

    percentage of smart farming as a whole. Cellular operators offer new services
    to target

    growers and enhance market facilities, especially in rural areas. The success
    of cellular

    technology is feasible when service providers guarantee its beneﬁts, such as ﬂexibility,

    portability, and extravagance, of both-way communication at low cost. In developing

    countries, mobile services and smartphone technology offer a hopeful future for
    farmers

    to enhance their crop yields. The low power wide area technology (LPWA) is anticipated

    to play a major role in smart farming agriculture, due to its improved facilities,
    efﬁcient

    coverage, low power consumption, and cost economics. The cellular operators with
    robust

    IoT create signiﬁcant returns by offering smart agriculture facilities in collaboration
    with

    LPWA technology.

    9.2. Wireless Sensors and IoT

    Placing wireless sensors around the ﬁeld provides timely information on a real-time

    basis to farmers in order to make decisions and act in order to obtain higher
    crop yields.

    Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) with GPS technology update all information on
    crop

    growth and terrain features. Recently, digital images and signal processing offer
    additional

    competencies to WSN, and precisely ascertain crop quality and health. The IoT
    technology

    can streamline tasks in a predictable manner by diagnosing crop requirements at
    each

    stage to maximize their effectiveness. In the future, IoT will be upgraded to
    the ﬁfth-

    generation (5G) cellular mobile communication technologies, to provide real-time
    data

    to farmers at any time and everywhere. Based on this achievement, around 29 billion

    IoT-based components are expected to operate in the agriculture sector by the
    end of 2022.

    Furthermore, it is expected to create 4.1 million data points daily from farms
    by 2050 [147].

    9.3. Drones and Unarmed Vehicles

    Farmers widely use drones for crop growth monitoring, spraying nutrient solutions

    and water, and pesticides in tough terrains and for different crop heights. Drones
    have

    proven their value for spraying speed, area coverage, and precision, compared
    to tradi-

    tional machinery. Due to advancements in technology, drones are equipped with
    various

    sensors, and 3D cameras provide comprehensive capabilities in land management
    by

    farmers. With the addition of UAVs in agriculture, many challenges, particularly
    the in-

    corporation of technologies and use in inclement weather conditions, are addressed
    by

    farmers. Other than drones, robotics in agriculture has also enhanced productivity
    due to

    higher yields achieved by spraying and weeding without human intervention. The
    seeding,

    transplanting, and fruit harvest/picking robots have recently added a new efﬁciency
    level

    to traditional methods.

    The UAV technology in smart agriculture provides information on fertilization,
    ir-

    rigation, use of pesticides, plant growth monitoring, weed management, crop disease

    management, and ﬁeld-level phenotyping to enhance cultivation practices. A new
    method

    of 3D modeling has been used to monitor crop growth parameters to determine the
    height

    of maize and sorghum plants under ﬁeld conditions using UAV, and the average root
    mean

    square error (RMSE) of sorghum height with hand sampling ﬁeld data was 0.33 m
    [148]. The

    UAV and 3D models were also restored to extract leaf area index (LAI) in soybean
    plants,

    the measured LAI predicted accuracy corresponding to the handheld device (R2 =
    0.92)

    was correlated with destructive LAI measurements (R2 = 0.89) [149].

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    19 of 26

    Weed detection and management were assessed by integrating low-resolution multi-

    spectral high-resolution RGB images [150] using the Random Forest (RF) technique
    in

    ﬁeld-grown rice and sugar beet crops [151]. Multi-spectral digital images obtained
    by

    UAVs are used for evaluating vegetation indices (VIs) and multi-temporal VIs to
    predict

    grain yield in wheat [152]. The indices, including the normalized difference vegetation

    index (NDVI), spectral vegetation index (SVI), and green area index (GAI), are
    evaluated in

    wheat crops to predict grain yield [153], monitor breeding [154], detect plant
    stress caused

    by yellow rust disease [155], and quantify plant density [156]. The usage of pesticides
    in

    agriculture is crucial for crop yields and the environment, and efforts have been
    made to

    develop and evaluate an algorithm to self-adjust UAV routes during chemical spraying
    in a

    crop ﬁeld to reduce the waste of pesticides and fertilizers [157].

    9.4. Vertical Farming and Hydroponics

    The shrinking of arable land and rapid urbanization results in greater pressure
    on the

    present resources [158], which causes hardships for food production with current
    agricul-

    ture practices. Vertical farming (VF) navigates land and water shortage challenges,
    and

    is highly suitable for adoption in nearby cities. Hydroponics plays a key role
    in lowering

    water requirements. Hydroponics, along with VF, increases available arable land
    without

    distressing forests and other natural habitats. The presence of advanced technologies,

    especially the IoT, makes the agriculture industry highly remunerative with a
    reduction in

    labor requirements and other resources, in addition to minimizing environmental
    impact.

    9.5. Performance Analysis Using Machine Learning

    Data analytics and machine learning concepts are applied to analyze the real-time

    data. In crop production, identifying the best genes is an important process that
    can be

    conducted using machine learning techniques. In agriculture, machine learning
    is used to

    envisage the best genes suited for crop production, especially for selecting seed
    varieties

    that are highly suitable to speciﬁc climate conditions and locations. Machine
    learning

    algorithms identify high demand products and currently unavailable products. Recent

    developments in machine learning and analytics allow farmers to correctly categorize
    their

    harvests before it is processes and delivered to customers.

    Machine learning (ML) in big data systems solves the issues related to farmers’

    decision-making, crops, animal research, land, food availability and security,
    weather

    and climate change, and weeds [159]. ML-based applications accommodate a large
    number

    of agricultural activities, such as yield prediction based on a deep memory model
    for

    maize [160], binary classiﬁcation model with logistic regression technique to
    assess rainfall

    intensity [161], and a short-term memory model to predict soil water content with
    data

    parameters of rainfall, temperature, water diversion, evaporation, and time for
    the next

    1, 2, and 7 days with greater R2 compared to artiﬁcial neural networks [162].
    As a result,

    the agricultural sector is increasing farmers’ incomes, and so communities are
    further

    integrated into the agricultural value chain to reduce poverty and provide access

    9.6. Renewable Energy, Microgrids and Smart Grids

    Smart farming requires extensive energy due to power consumption by long-standing

    sensor placement, use of GPS, and data transmission. Traditionally, using renewable
    energy

    sources in remote areas solves long-term power issues. Smart grids and microgrids
    are

    integrated into distributed energy sources (DERs). Recent advances in storage
    devices

    combine electricity and heat systems to stock energy and use the heat produced.

    Globally, smart grid technology enables a smooth transition from traditional to
    smart

    energy systems, ensuring energy security. In developing countries, power-strengthening

    systems integrated with renewable sources have enhanced the transport sector,
    and in-

    creased bioenergy use in the power sector through profuse renewable energy sources

    identiﬁed using smart technologies, such as, energy storage devices, smart appliances,

    computational intelligence, and the IoT. For example, the smart grid provides
    a broad

    range of opportunities for power sector reform in Nepal, alleviating the rural
    electricity

    problem by implementing smart microgrids, and subsequently, connecting to the
    national

    grid [164]. The Dayalbagh renewable energy smart microgrid in India is a small-scale

    electricity system comprising distributed loads and renewable energy resources,
    acting as a

    single controllable entity in the grid. The smart microgrids are integrated into
    renewable

    resources and form building blocks of smart grids, especially for the dairy plant
    to produce

    various dairy products [165].

    The mixed integer linear programme (MILP) systematically and efﬁciently managed

    energy consumption and subsequently lowered the cost, especially in residential
    areas,

    by scheduling the use of smart appliances and charging/discharging electric vehicles

    (EVs). The model generates its own energy from a microgrid containing solar panels

    and wind turbines, and forecasts wind speed and solar radiation for effective
    energy

    management. MILP-based energy planning sustains the effectiveness and productiveness

    of energy-efﬁcient techniques [166].

    10. Conclusions

    Smarter and more efﬁcient crop production methodologies are needed to address
    the

    issues of shrinking arable land and the food demands of an increasing world population.

    There is a necessity for everyone to be aware of food security in terms of sustainable

    agriculture. The growth of new technologies for increasing crop yield and encouraging

    the adoption of farming by innovative young people as a legitimate profession.
    This

    paper emphasized the role of many technologies used for farming, particularly
    the IoT,

    in making agriculture smarter and more effective in meeting future requirements.
    The

    current challenges faced by the industry and future prospects are noted to guide
    scholars

    and engineers. Hence, every piece of farmland is important to enhance crop production
    by

    dealing with every inch of land using sustainable IoT-based sensors and communication

    technologies.

    \ a transformation driven by new technologies, which seems\nvery promising as\
    \ it will enable this primary sector to move to the next level of farm productivity\n\
    and proﬁtability [1]. Precision Agriculture, which consist of applying inputs\
    \ (what is needed) when\nand where is needed, has become the third wave of the\
    \ modern agriculture revolution (the ﬁrst was\nmechanization and the second the\
    \ green revolution with its genetic modiﬁcation [2]), and nowadays,\nit is being\
    \ enhanced with an increase of farm knowledge systems due to the availability\
    \ of larger\namounts of data. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)\
    \ already reported in October\n2016 that Precision Agriculture technologies increased\
    \ net returns and operating proﬁts [3]. Also,\nwhen considering the environment,\
    \ new technologies are increasingly being applied in the farms\nto maintain the\
    \ sustainability of farm production. However, the adoption of these technologies\n\
    involves uncertainty and trade-oﬀs. According to a market analysis, the factors\
    \ that would facilitate\nthe adoption of sustainable farming technologies include\
    \ better education and training of farmers,\nsharing of information, easy availability\
    \ of ﬁnancial resources, and increasing consumer demand\nfor organic food [4].\
    \ When applying these new technologies, the challenge for retrieving data from\n\
    crops is to come out with something coherent and valuable, because data themselves\
    \ are not useful,\njust numbers or images. Farms that decide to be technology-driven\
    \ in some way, show valuable\nadvantages, such us saving money and work, having\
    \ an increased production or a reduction of costs\nwith minimal eﬀort, and producing\
    \ quality food with more environmentally friendly practices [5].\nHowever, taking\
    \ these advantages to the farm will depend, not only on the willingness of producers\n\

    Agronomy 2020, 10, 207\n2 of 21\nfor adopting new technologies in their ﬁelds,\
    \ but also on each speciﬁc farm potential in terms of scale\neconomies, as proﬁt\
    \ margin increases with farm size. The USDA reported that, on average, corn\n\
    farm operating proﬁt of Precision Agriculture adopters was 163 dollars per hectare\
    \ higher than for\nnon-adopters, taking into account that the highest adoption\
    \ rates for three technologies (computer\nmapping, guidance, and variable-rate\
    \ equipment) were on farms over 1500 hectares [3]. Such margins\ncan even go up\
    \ to 272 dollars depending on the crop. A greater use of Smart Farming services\
    \ is vital\nto not only improving a farm’s ﬁnancial performance, but also to meet\
    \ the food needs of an expanding\npopulation [6].\nThe ﬁnal purpose of this paper\
    \ is to demonstrate how making decisions with the modern\ndata-based agriculture\
    \ available today can lead to sustainable and proﬁtable actuation to nourish\n\
    people while reducing harm to the environment. In order to evaluate how modern\
    \ agriculture can help\nin a sustainable decision-making process, this article\
    \ revisits the main steps of an information-based\nagriculture and focuses on\
    \ data management systems by reviewing recent applications related to each\ncrucial\
    \ step, from data acquisition in crop ﬁelds to the execution of tasks with variable\
    \ rate equipment.\n2. Data-Driven Agriculture: Agriculture 4.0\nThis new philosophy\
    \ centered on agricultural data has been expressed with several names:\nAgriculture\
    \ 4.0, Digital Farming, or Smart Farming, and was born when telematics and data\
    \ management\nwere combined to the already known concept of Precision Agriculture,\
    \ improving the accuracy of\noperations [7]. As a result, Agriculture 4.0 is based\
    \ on Precision Agriculture principles with producers\nusing systems that generate\
    \ data in their farms, which will be processed in such a way to make proper\n\
    strategical and operational decisions. Traditionally, farmers have gone to the\
    \ ﬁelds to check the status\nof their crops and make decisions based on their\
    \ accumulated experience. This approach is no longer\nsustainable as, among other\
    \ reasons, some ﬁelds are too large to be eﬃciently managed according to\nthe\
    \ threefold criteria that will lead the coming years: Eﬃciency, sustainability\
    \ and availability (for\npeople). Advanced management systems within the context\
    \ of Smart Farming are providing practical\nsolutions. Also, despite some farmers\
    \ have a long-time experience gathered after many years of work\nin the ﬁeld,\
    \ technology may provide a systematic tool to detect unforeseen problems hard\
    \ to notice\nby visual inspection on occasional checks. Regarding the willingness\
    \ of adopting modern tools in\nagriculture, young farmers show a more positive\
    \ attitude than elder ones, as the former can support\ntheir not-so-large experience\
    \ in the ﬁeld with new smart tools providing key information. However,\nthe average\
    \ age of farmers in the last decades has been alarmingly increasing: Around 58\
    \ years old in\nthe USA and Europe, 60 in sub-Saharan Africa, or 63 in Japan [8,9].\
    \ Fortunately, this trend is expected\nto change. Several European policies, for\
    \ example, are being set to support a generational renewal,\nfacilitating access\
    \ to initial investment, loans, business advice, and training [9]. A generational\
    \ renewal\nin a rural development context goes beyond a reduction in the average\
    \ age of farmers; it is also about\nempowering a new generation of highly qualiﬁed\
    \ young farmers to bring the full beneﬁts of technology\nin order to support sustainable\
    \ farming practices [10]. This implies that young farmers will need to\ntransform\
    \ the existing land to more modern and competitive farms with the purpose of maintaining\n\
    viable food production while improving the competitiveness of the agrifood chain,\
    \ because with\nadvanced technologies and new thinking, young people can transform\
    \ the agricultural sector [8].\n2.1. Internet of Things: Collecting Information\n\
    Internet of things (IoT) in an agricultural context refers to the use of sensors\
    \ and other devices to\nturn every element and action involved in farming into\
    \ data. It has been reported that an estimation\nof a 10% to 15% of US farmers\
    \ are using IoT solutions on the farm across 1200 million hectares and\n250,000\
    \ farms [11]. IoT drives Agriculture 4.0 [12]; in fact, IoT technologies is one\
    \ of the reasons why\nagriculture can generate such a big amount of valuable information,\
    \ and the agriculture sector is\nexpected to be highly inﬂuenced by the advances\
    \ in these technologies [13]. It is estimated that, with\nnew techniques, the\
    \ IoT has the potential to increase agricultural productivity by 70% by 2050 [14],\n\
    Agronomy 2020, 10, 207\n3 of 21\nwhich is positive, because according to Myklevy\
    \ et al., the world needs to increase global food\nproduction by 60% by 2050 due\
    \ to a population growth over nine thousand million [15]. The main\nadvantages\
    \ of the use of IoT are achieving higher crop yields and less cost. For example,\
    \ studies from\nOnFarm found that for an average farm using IoT, yield rises by\
    \ 1.75% and energy costs drop 17 to\n32 dollars per hectare, while water use for\
    \ irrigation falls by 8% [12].\n2.2. Big Data: Analysis of Massive Data\nIn the\
    \ current technology-based era, the concept of big data is present in many economic\
    \ sectors,\nbut is it already available to agriculture?\nThe ever-growing amount\
    \ of data available for ﬁeld\nmanagement makes necessary the implementation of\
    \ some type of automatic process to extract\noperational information from bulk\
    \ data. However, the volume of data currently retrieved from most\ncommercial\
    \ ﬁelds is, arguably, not yet at the level considered to be classiﬁed as big data.\
    \ According to\nManyica et al. [16], big data has three dimensions: Volume, velocity,\
    \ and variety. Kunisch [17] added a\nfourth V for veracity. Finally, a ﬁfth V\
    \ was added by Chi et al. for the extra dimension valorization [18].\nOverall,\
    \ the ﬁve V (dimensions) of big data stand for:\n•\nVolume refers to datasets\
    \ whose size is beyond the ability of typical database software tools to\ncapture,\
    \ store, manage, and analyze information. This deﬁnition includes an estimate\
    \ of how big\na dataset needs to be in order to be considered big, and it can\
    \ vary by study sector, depending on\nsoftware tools that are commonly available\
    \ and common sizes of datasets, typically starting in the\nterabyte range [16].\n\
    •\nVelocity refers to the capability to acquire, understand and interpret events\
    \ as they occur.\nIn agriculture, this would refer to applications that occur\
    \ in real time, like data being processed\nright in the ﬁeld to apply variable\
    \ rates of chemicals in equipment featuring variable rate\napplication technologies.\n\
    •\nVariety refers to the diﬀerent data formats (videos, text, voice), and the\
    \ diverse degrees of\ncomplexity. This situation is not strange in agriculture\
    \ when diﬀerent data sources are used to\nwork in complex scenarios such as images\
    \ and soil or weather probes.\n•\nVeracity refers to the quality, reliability,\
    \ and overall conﬁdence of the data.\n•\nValorization is the ability to propagate\
    \ knowledge, appreciation and innovation [18].\nIn the context of crop management,\
    \ Kunisch [17] concluded that big data is applicable only in\nsome cases in agriculture,\
    \ depending on each farm and its level of technology adoption. Nevertheless,\n\
    the Proagrica [19] report conﬁrmed that big data was being increasingly applied\
    \ in the agriculture\nsector. Kamilaris et al. [18] cited 34 works where big data\
    \ was used in agricultural applications, and\nWolfert et al. [20] published a\
    \ review on big data applications in Smart Farming. In line with this\ntrend,\
    \ the Consortium of International Agricultural Research Centers (CGIAR, Montpellier,\
    \ France)\ncreated a Platform for Big Data in Agriculture with the purpose of\
    \ using big data approaches to solve\nagricultural development problems faster,\
    \ better, and at a greater scale than before [21].\n2.3. Agriculture 5.0: Robotics\
    \ and Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) to Help in Nourishing People\nBig engineering\
    \ challenges typically spur big solutions through disruptive technologies,\nand\
    \ Agriculture 5.0 is probably the one for the ﬁrst half of the 21st Century. The\
    \ concept Agriculture\n5.0 implies that farms are following Precision Agriculture\
    \ principles and using equipment that involves\nunmanned operations and autonomous\
    \ decision support systems. Thus, Agriculture 5.0 implies the use\nof robots and\
    \ some forms of AI [22]. By tradition, farms have needed many workers, mostly\
    \ seasonal,\nto harvest crops and keep farms productive. However, society has\
    \ moved away from being an agrarian\nsociety with large quantities of people living\
    \ in farms to people living in cities now; as a result, farms\nare facing the\
    \ challenge of a workforce shortage. One solution to help with this shortage of\
    \ workers is\nagricultural robots integrating AI features. According to a Forbes\
    \ study [23], farm robots augment\nthe human labor workforce and can harvest crops\
    \ at a higher volume and faster pace than human\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 207\n4 of\
    \ 21\nlaborers. Although there are still many cases in which robots are not as\
    \ fast as humans, agriculture is\ncurrently developing robotic systems to work\
    \ in the ﬁeld and help producers with tedious tasks [24–27],\npushing agricultural\
    \ systems to the new concept of Agriculture 5.0. According to Reddy et al. [28],\n\
    the advent of robots in agriculture drastically increased the productivity in\
    \ several countries and\nreduced the farm operating costs. As said before, robotic\
    \ applications for agriculture are growing\nexponentially [27], which oﬀers promising\
    \ solutions for Smart Farming in handling labor shortage and\na long-time declining\
    \ proﬁtability; however, like most innovations, there exist important limitations\n\
    to cope with at the current early stages. These technologies are still too expensive\
    \ for most farmers,\nespecially those with small farms [29], because scale economics\
    \ make small individual farms less\nproﬁtable [30]. Nevertheless, the cost of\
    \ technology decreases with time, and agricultural robots will be\nsurely implemented\
    \ in the future as the alternative to bring about higher production [4,31]. The\
    \ world\nagricultural production and crop yields slowed down in 2015. The concept\
    \ of agricultural robotics\nwas introduced to overcome these problems and satisfy\
    \ the rising demand for high yields. Robotic\ninnovations are giving a boost to\
    \ the global agriculture and crop production market, as according to\nthe Veriﬁed\
    \ Market Intelligence report, agricultural robots will be capable of completing\
    \ ﬁeld tasks\nwith greater eﬃciency as compared to the farmers [32].\nAgricultural\
    \ tech startups have raised over 800 million dollars in the last ﬁve years [31].\
    \ Startups\nusing robotics and machine learning to solve problems in agriculture\
    \ started gaining momentum in\n2014, in line with a rising interest in AI [33].\
    \ In fact, venture capital funding in AI has increased by 450%\nin the last 5\
    \ years [34]. This kind of new agriculture pretends to do more with less, because\
    \ nourishing\npeople while increasing production sustainably and taking care of\
    \ the environment will be crucial in\nthe coming years, as the Food and Agriculture\
    \ Organization of the United Nations (FAO) estimates\nthat, in 2050, there will\
    \ be a world population of 9.6 billion [35]. Advanced sensing technologies in\n\
    agriculture can help to meet the challenge; they provide detailed information\
    \ on soil, crop status,\nand environmental conditions to allow precise applications\
    \ of phytosanitary products, resulting in a\nreduced used of herbicides and pesticides,\
    \ improved water use eﬃciency and increased crop yield and\nquality [2].\n3. Data-Driven\
    \ Management for Advanced Farming: Principal Stages\nThe raw measurements of key\
    \ parameters from crops need to be eﬃciently processed so that\nnumbers or images\
    \ unambiguously turn into valuable information. Crop management based on ﬁeld\n\
    data already evolved when Precision Agriculture came to light thirty years ago,\
    \ but it has certainly\nbeen transformed by the present digital information era.\
    \ Traditionally, and in those places where\ntechnology has not arrived yet, ﬁeld\
    \ management consists of visually inspecting the development of\ncrops to reach\
    \ a diagnosis with which farmers make decisions and actuate giving diﬀerent treatments\n\
    to their crops. This approach relies on ﬁeld experience and the information perceived\
    \ through the\neyes of farmers. Additionally, associated growers can follow the\
    \ recommendations of cooperative\ntechnicians or engineers hired by the society\
    \ they belong to. In farms where advanced technology\nhas been implemented, ﬁeld\
    \ management varies according to the operating cycle shown in Figure 1.\nThis\
    \ management system based on objective ﬁeld data and smart decision-making starts\
    \ with the actual\ncrop to manage, taking advantage of its inner variability,\
    \ both spatial-wise and time-wise. The platform\nrefers to the physical means\
    \ with which information is acquired, being the sensors the speciﬁc elements\n\
    through which objective data are obtained. Data includes the information directly\
    \ retrieved from the\nparameters measured from the crop, soil, or ambient. Retrieving\
    \ the data from the sensors can be done\nin multiple ways, from inserting a pen\
    \ drive in a USB port to get the ﬁles [36] to retrieving data from\nsoftware applications\
    \ synchronized to the Internet. The nexus between the data and the decision stage\n\
    involves ﬁltering routines and AI algorithms for getting only the right data and\
    \ helping the grower\nmake correct decisions. Finally, actuation refers to the\
    \ physical execution of an action commanded by\nthe decision system, and is typically\
    \ carried out by advanced equipment that can receive orders from\na computerized\
    \ control unit. As each action takes place over the crop, the cycle starts and\
    \ closes at\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 207\n5 of 21\ncrop level; the response of the\
    \ crop is then registered by specialized sensors and the loop continues\nsystematically\
    \ until harvesting time, which marks the end of the crop life cycle.\nAgronomy\

    \ of the Agricultural Management Cycle—Analyzing \nVariability \nRegardless how\
    \ the crop will be managed, some degree of spatial variability is assumed for\
    \ all \nfields by nature. According to Searcy [37], natural variability is influenced\
    \ by weather within a \ngrowing season and from year to year; then, data from\
    \ several years may be needed to determine \ntrends in the parameters of interest,\
    \ and hence, data becomes a regular input to the farm management \nsystem. Therefore,\
    \ the necessity of monitoring crops comes from the existence of variability, but\
    \ there \nis a need for the producer to manage that variability in a feasible\
    \ way, and the widely accepted way \nto do it is by setting within-field management\
    \ zones. Management zones are subfield areas that have \nhomogeneous features,\
    \ so field practices can be custom-made to each of such areas, resulting in a\
    \ \npractical and cost-effective approach to Precision Agriculture [41]. The adoption\
    \ of management \nzones would reduce the cost of fertilizing, improve crop yields,\
    \ reduce the usage of pesticides, \nprovide better farm records that are essential\
    \ for sale, and provide better information for \nmanagement decisions [4]. According\
    \ to Zhang et al. [38], the number of management zones is a \nfunction of the\
    \ natural variability within the field, the size of the field and certain management\
    \ \nfactors. If the variability is high, the minimum size of a zone is limited\
    \ by the possibility of each \nfarmer to differentially manage regions within\
    \ a field in economic and logistics terms. In addition to \ndecide the area of\
    \ working zones, the selection of the specific parameters to be tracked within\
    \ those \nzones must be carefully made early in the process. Rovira-Más and Saiz-Rubio\

    3.1. Stage I: The Crop as the Beginning and End of the Agricultural Management\
    \ Cycle—Analyzing Variability\nRegardless how the crop will be managed, some degree\
    \ of spatial variability is assumed for all\nﬁelds by nature. According to Searcy\
    \ [37], natural variability is inﬂuenced by weather within a growing\nseason and\
    \ from year to year; then, data from several years may be needed to determine\
    \ trends in\nthe parameters of interest, and hence, data becomes a regular input\
    \ to the farm management system.\nTherefore, the necessity of monitoring crops\
    \ comes from the existence of variability, but there is a need\nfor the producer\
    \ to manage that variability in a feasible way, and the widely accepted way to\
    \ do it is by\nsetting within-ﬁeld management zones. Management zones are subﬁeld\
    \ areas that have homogeneous\nfeatures, so ﬁeld practices can be custom-made\
    \ to each of such areas, resulting in a practical and\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 207\n\
    6 of 21\ncost-eﬀective approach to Precision Agriculture [41]. The adoption of\
    \ management zones would reduce\nthe cost of fertilizing, improve crop yields,\
    \ reduce the usage of pesticides, provide better farm records\nthat are essential\
    \ for sale, and provide better information for management decisions [4]. According\n\
    to Zhang et al. [38], the number of management zones is a function of the natural\
    \ variability within\nthe ﬁeld, the size of the ﬁeld and certain management factors.\
    \ If the variability is high, the minimum\nsize of a zone is limited by the possibility\
    \ of each farmer to diﬀerentially manage regions within a\nﬁeld in economic and\
    \ logistics terms. In addition to decide the area of working zones, the selection\
    \ of\nthe speciﬁc parameters to be tracked within those zones must be carefully\
    \ made early in the process.\nRovira-Más and Saiz-Rubio [65] classiﬁed crop biometric\
    \ traits in a tri-level division of crop features\ndepending on the focus of interest\
    \ being at soil level, plant level, or produce level. This division\nallowed the\
    \ superimposition of various layers in a standardized map with the aim of determining\
    \ a\ndata-based wine quality index deﬁned as the Quality Potential Index (QPI)\
    \ for each subﬁeld area in a\nvineyard. Nevertheless, there may be speciﬁc cases\
    \ where the spatial variability of a ﬁeld is so low that\na single mapping event\
    \ can be suﬃcient, as reported by Klassen et al. [42] when characterizing soil\n\
    variability in rice ﬁelds.\n3.2. Stage II: Platforms Supporting Sensors\nSensors\
    \ are the universal devices to monitor crops and to obtain objective information\
    \ from them.\nThey are usually integrated in a platform, which is the general\
    \ term used in Figure 1 to name the\nstructures where sensors are placed and carried.\
    \ These platforms may be attached to oﬀ-road vehicles\nor ﬁxed to the ground within\
    \ ﬁelds such as local weather stations. One of the most urgent challenges to\n\
    cope with in the next few years will be getting a wider range of non-invasive\
    \ sensors able to measure\non-the-go. This approach would be closer to Agriculture\
    \ 5.0, as these sensors could be attached to\nautonomous platforms and robots.\
    \ Nowadays, not all the parameters of interest can be measured\nnon-invasively\
    \ and at a distance from the target; however, some technologies such as multispectral\
    \ or\nhyperspectral imaging are making signiﬁcant improvements.\n3.2.1. Remote\
    \ Sensing Platforms: Satellites\nRemote sensing has played a key role in the progress\
    \ of Smart Farming when ﬁeld data became\ngenerally accessible from artiﬁcial\
    \ satellites. Important satellites providing agricultural information are\nthe\
    \ American Landsat satellites (eight satellites take spectral data from the Earth\
    \ each 16 to 18 days),\nthe European Sentinel 2 satellite system (it provides\
    \ multispectral data at 10 m pixel resolution for\nNDVI—Normalized Diﬀerence Vegetation\
    \ Index—imagery, soil, and water cover every ten days), the\nRapidEye constellation\
    \ (ﬁve satellites provide multispectral RGB imagery, as well as red-edge and NIR\n\
    bands at 5 m resolution), the GeoEye-1 system (captures multispectral RGB data\
    \ and NIR data at a\n1.84 m resolution), and the WorldView-3 (collects multispectral\
    \ data from the RGB bands including\nthe red-edge, two NIR bands, and 8 SWIR bands\
    \ with a resolution of 1.24 m at nadir). IKONOS\nand QuickBird have been already\
    \ decommissioned. There exist several reviews on satellite sensing\napplications,\
    \ having recent studies focused on the potential applications of thermal technologies\
    \ using\nremote sensing [44] and nutritional status in commodity crops [45].\n\
    3.2.2. Aircraft Systems\nThe distance between crops and satellites is considerable,\
    \ typically around 700 km, and deeper\ninsights are reachable when sensors remain\
    \ closer to the targets. For aircraft systems, the distance\nto land can be around\
    \ 100 m. For example, there is a legal limit of 120 m above the ground in Spain\n\
    for unmanned ﬂying vehicles. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and remotely-piloted\
    \ aircrafts (RPA)\ncan basically be of two kinds: Fixed-wing aircrafts and multirotor\
    \ aircrafts. Rotary-wing UAVs are\nmore stable ﬂiers as they are capable of a\
    \ vertical take-oﬀ and landing; however, they are slower and\ncannot cover as\
    \ much area during their battery life. Fixed-wing platforms, on the other hand,\
    \ can cover\nmore area per ﬂight and carry larger payloads, but tend to be more\
    \ expensive and break more easily\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 207\n7 of 21\nafter multiple\
    \ landings [45]. When compared to remote sensing, the advantages of UAVs for Precision\n\
    Agriculture are their ﬂexibility in frequency (revisit time of satellites) and\
    \ better spatial resolutions.\nWhen compared to ground vehicles, UAVs can get\
    \ data from inaccessible places where conventional\nequipment cannot stand; however,\
    \ they require a professional planning of the ﬂight route beforehand,\nand certain\
    \ machine vision applications may require ﬂying at midday to avoid vegetation\
    \ shadows\non the ground causing errors with imagery data. Furthermore, post processing\
    \ the data and image\nmosaicking is often quite challenging. An important disadvantage\
    \ of UAVs is the limited payload\nthey can carry, which often limits the suite\
    \ of sensors onboard, as well as the incapacity of ﬂying with\nstrong wind.\n\
    3.2.3. Proximal Sensing: Ground Autonomous Systems—the Great Push for Agriculture\
    \ 5.0\nWhen monitoring platforms operate from the ground, the distance from the\
    \ sensors to the target\ncrop diminishes to less than 2 m. Due to the proximity\
    \ of the sensor to the plant, when data is acquired\nfrom ground-based platforms,\
    \ it is called proximal sensing. Ground vehicles are polyvalent in relation\n\
    to the payload of sensors. As these vehicles move near the crop, the data acquired\
    \ increase in accuracy,\nand resolutions of one or more samples per meter are\
    \ feasible, being only limited by the speciﬁcations\nof the particular sensors\
    \ implemented. When active sensors are used, weather conditions such as\nstrong\
    \ sunlight or poor illumination are not a serious problem anymore, and, in case\
    \ of on-the-ﬂy\nprocessing, real-time applications are possible, as spraying weeds\
    \ with the previous detection of the\npest [47]. There has been a signiﬁcant impulse\
    \ in the last ﬁve years for the particular case where data is\nretrieved from\
    \ an autonomous platform (unmanned ground vehicle or UGV) [48–52]. Aravind et\
    \ al. [48]\nreviewed ground robots for tilling, soil analysis, seeding, transplanting,\
    \ crop scouting, pest control,\nweed removal and harvesting, where crop scouting\
    \ has been deﬁned as the process of continuously\nmonitoring the ﬁeld to acquire\
    \ information on the plant status, disease incidence, and infestations\naﬀecting\
    \ crop growth. Shamshiri et al. [27] described recent achievements of UGVs for\
    \ weed control,\nﬁeld scouting, and harvesting, highlighting that, if successfully\
    \ integrated and implemented, ﬁeld\nscouting robots can play a key role in reducing\
    \ production cost, increasing productivity and quality,\nand enabling customized\
    \ plant and crop treatments. The European Commission (EC) has recently\nbacked\
    \ the relevance of robotic technology for Smart Farming by funding four projects\
    \ involving the\nconstruction of UGVs for advanced vineyard management: VineRobot,\
    \ Vinbot, GRAPE, and VineScout.\nIn 2016, the European project VineRobot [53]\
    \ delivered a monitoring robot prototype at a Technology\nReadiness Level (TRL)\
    \ status between 6 and 7 (TRL1 represents an early stage concept and TRL9\nis\
    \ a solution ready for production), paving the path for its conceptual termination\
    \ in the VineScout\nproject [54]. The 2019 version of VineScout is shown in Figure\
    \ 2. This robot is autonomously driven\nwhen monitoring vineyards with the assistance\
    \ of local perception sensors (stereo camera, lidar and\nultrasound sensors) for\
    \ navigation and safeguarding. It gathers data from the canopy of the vines with\n\
    the goal of creating plant water status maps and nutritional status maps. In order\
    \ to accomplish its\nmission in a reasonable timeframe, established by end-users\
    \ at a rate of 6 ha per day, this robot monitors\nvine canopies non-invasively,\
    \ which implies several challenges. Regarding hardware, fast and robust\nsensors\
    \ were set to work non-invasively and in motion, while having a cost-eﬃcient price\
    \ for the\nagriculture sector. Regarding software, the challenge was the agile\
    \ integration of all the crop-sensing\ndevices and the multi-season ground-truth\
    \ validation of the models developed in the ﬁeld.\nIn addition to scouting robots,\
    \ the introduction of robotics to the farm is also being led by industry\non speciﬁc\
    \ agricultural tasks. Naïo Technologies, for instance, has developed robot Oz\
    \ for mechanical\nweeding [55], and the autonomous sprayer GUSS received the Davidson\
    \ Prize in 2019 [56]. RowBot\nSystems LLC (Minneapolis, MN, USA) patented a robotic\
    \ platform whose structure was conﬁgured\nto perform several ﬁeld tasks, as selectively\
    \ applying fertilizer, mapping growth zones, or seeding\ncover crop [57]. Over\
    \ the 20th century, farm productivity has been increasing by augmenting the\n\
    size of machines, which has led to heavy and oversized equipment. In order to\
    \ invert this trend,\nresearchers and growers have started to think about alternatives\
    \ to tractors to avoid soil compaction.\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 207\n8 of 21\nShamshiri\
    \ et al. [27] suggested using various machines instead of one heavy machine. In\
    \ the same\nline, Hameed [58] proposed a technology that enabled a single farmer\
    \ to control a team of automated\nvehicles, and Ball et al. [59] used cooperative\
    \ robots as a measure to control weeds. In fact, there\nhave been several projects\
    \ implementing more than one machine operating in collaborative work,\nas the\
    \ Flourish European project that combines UAVs and UGVs to retrieve information\
    \ for decision\nsupport [46], or the RHEA project where a ﬂeet of autonomous robot\
    \ units performed treatments in\ncrops [82].\n \nfunding four projects involving\
    \ the construction of UGVs for advanced vineyard management: \nVineRobot, Vinbot,\
    \ GRAPE, and VineScout. In 2016, the European project VineRobot [53] delivered\
    \ \na monitoring robot prototype at a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) status\
    \ between 6 and 7 (TRL1 \nrepresents an early stage concept and TRL9 is a solution\
    \ ready for production), paving the path for \nits conceptual termination in the\
    \ VineScout project [54]. The 2019 version of VineScout is shown in \nFigure 2.\
    \ This robot is autonomously driven when monitoring vineyards with the assistance\
    \ of local \nperception sensors (stereo camera, lidar and ultrasound sensors)\
    \ for navigation and safeguarding. It \ngathers data from the canopy of the vines\
    \ with the goal of creating plant water status maps and \nnutritional status maps.\
    \ In order to accomplish its mission in a reasonable timeframe, established by\
    \ \nend-users at a rate of 6 ha per day, this robot monitors vine canopies non-invasively,\
    \ which implies \nseveral challenges. Regarding hardware, fast and robust sensors\
    \ were set to work non-invasively and \nin motion, while having a cost-efficient\
    \ price for the agriculture sector. Regarding software, the \nchallenge was the\
    \ agile integration of all the crop-sensing devices and the multi-season ground-truth\
    \ \nvalidation of the models developed in the field. \n \n \n(a) \n(b) \nFigure\

    \ \nFigure 2. Version II (2019) of VineScout autonomous robot: Front (a) and rear\
    \ (b).\n3.3. Stage III: Data\nOne of the fundamental diﬀerences between traditional\
    \ and modern farming is, apart from the\nmechanization level, the data collected\
    \ directly from the crops. In traditional farms where growers\njudge by visual\
    \ assessment, decisions are relative and subjective. Modern farming oﬀers assessment\n\
    by quantitative data producing objective decisions. Sensors allow data acquisition\
    \ in the ﬁeld, but\nthe special case of non-invasive technologies in combination\
    \ with on-the-ﬂy sensing from moving\nplatforms has opened the window of massive\
    \ data collection, a forerunner of big data in agriculture.\nHowever, the excess\
    \ of data is also a serious challenge to cope with, as vital information may result\n\
    masked by noise. The NDVI measurements collected for plotting the maps of Figure\
    \ 3 [94] were\ncollected with two sensors working simultaneously (SRS sensors,\
    \ METER Group, Inc., Pullman, WA,\nUSA) and placed in the robot of Figure 2. One\
    \ of the sensors pointed to the sky and corrected NDVI\nestimates with the incident\
    \ light from the sun, and the other sensor pointed sidewise to the canopy\nto\
    \ collect data from the leaves at an approximate distance of 0.5 m. The zenithal\
    \ photo inserted on\nthe bottom-right corner of Figure 3a shows the VineScout\
    \ autonomous robot taking data between\ntwo rows in a vineyard. The onboard algorithm\
    \ averaged individual local measurements of NDVI in\nsquare cells of 16 m2 classiﬁed\
    \ into nine NDVI levels between 0 and 1 (Figure 3a). The grid map of\nFigure 3a,\
    \ despite informative, is not operational, so a further simpliﬁcation of data\
    \ is necessary before\na grower may ﬁnd it useful. Figure 3b is the result of\
    \ applying a clustering ﬁlter to Figure 3a. It shows\ntwo management zones based\
    \ on vine vigor (high-medium) for the grower to make decisions, together\nwith\
    \ water status maps, about fertilization and diﬀerential harvesting.\nAgronomy\

    3.3.1. Maps Containing Relevant Field Features\nDisplaying data in a coherent\
    \ format is key for ﬁnal users to understand what is happening in the\nﬁeld. The\
    \ most common way to display agricultural data has been in the format of maps,\
    \ as mapping is\nuseful to deﬁne spatial trends and homogeneous zones. However,\
    \ displaying agronomical information\nin beautiful maps should not be the goal\
    \ of map generation. Maps need to be useful for making decisions,\nthey need to\
    \ be a help to answer a question, providing an interpretation of spatial information\
    \ [39].\nThe goal of building maps is obtaining a few management zones with the\
    \ parameters of interest so that a\ntreatment can be eﬃciently applied. To get\
    \ plausible management zones, kriging is one of the most used\ninterpolation techniques\
    \ to delimit areas of manageable sizes [43]. Taking into account the considerable\n\
    amount of data that Smart Farming generates, there are many software applications\
    \ to cope with\ninterpolation, in general, or kriging in particular [66]. Also,\
    \ when building a map, a coordinate system\nneeds to be supplied along with the\
    \ map. One ideal alternative for agricultural maps is brought by\nthe Local Tangent\
    \ Plane (LTP) coordinate system, which features Euclidean geometry, allows user-set\n\
    origins, and employs the intuitive coordinate frame east-north. Regarding the\
    \ coding and display of\ndata in the maps, grids allow the systematic quantization\
    \ of the LTP coordinate system to manage crop\nproduction information more eﬃciently,\
    \ facilitating the exchange of information among successive\nseasons and the comparison\
    \ of multiple parameters on the same ﬁeld [67]. A practical example of\ngrid-based\
    \ maps using LTP coordinates is shown in Figure 3.\nTaking into account the key\
    \ role of positioning systems, a map-based approach is the method\nin which a\
    \ Global Positioning System (GPS)—or any other Global Navigation Satellite System\n\
    (GNSS)—receiver and a data logger (e.g., an onboard computer) are used to record\
    \ the position of a\nparticular measurement (georeferenced data), so several maps\
    \ can be generated and processed along\nwith other layers of spatially variable\
    \ information [68]. In general, GNSS receivers are the universal\nposition devices\
    \ used to build maps; however, in some cases, for example in greenhouses or dense\n\
    ﬁelds of tall trees, GNSS is not the best option to use due to the diﬃculty of\
    \ getting signals with reliable\naccuracy; so, in some cases, alternative solutions\
    \ such as machine vision must be implemented [69].\n3.3.2. Data Management Software\
    \ to Ease the Process of Decision Making\nA popular way to manage ﬁeld data displayed\
    \ on maps and culminate with a practical solution\nis through the use of Geographic\
    \ Information Systems (GIS). This set of computer-based tools (or\ndata platforms)\
    \ allows to store, analyze, manipulate and map any type of georeferenced information.\n\
    A speciﬁc GIS system called the Field-level geographic Information System (FIS)\
    \ was developed\nfor Precision Agriculture applications [70], but it was set for\
    \ old computer operative systems\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 207\n10 of 21\nsuch as Windows\
    \ 3.1×, 95, 98, or NT [71]. The updated version of FIS is the farm management\n\
    information system (FMIS), which according to Burlacu et al. [72] is a management\
    \ information system\ndesigned to assist farmers with various tasks, ranging from\
    \ operational planning, implementation and\ndocumentation to the assessment of\
    \ performed ﬁeld work. The purpose of FMIS is to reduce production\ncosts, comply\
    \ with agricultural standards, and maintain high product quality and safety, guiding\n\
    growers to make the best decisions possible [95]. Farm management software solutions\
    \ support the\nautomation of data acquisition and processing, monitoring, planning,\
    \ decision making, documenting,\nand managing the farm operations [64], and include\
    \ basic functions for record keeping like crop\nproduction rates (harvests and\
    \ yields), proﬁts and losses, farm tasks scheduling, weather prediction,\nsoil\
    \ nutrients tracking, and ﬁeld mapping, up to more complex functionalities for\
    \ automating ﬁeld\nmanagement accounting for farms and agribusinesses (accounting,\
    \ inventory management, or labor\ncontracts). In many cases, growers do not need\
    \ to be ﬂuid on data management because the software can\nbuild maps or decision-making\
    \ models with basic information introduced by growers. Furthermore,\na critical\
    \ feature of these applications is that they even help in the early warning of\
    \ weather-related\nhazards that enables farmers, policy makers, and aid agencies\
    \ to mitigate their exposure to risk [83].\nHowever, it must be taken into consideration\
    \ that the eﬃciency of a recommendation for a particular\nagent will depend on\
    \ the factors included in the algorithms of the software (technical, economic,\n\
    safety-wise. . . ). In this sense, a DSSAT (Decision Support System for Agrotechnology\
    \ Transfer)\nprovides outputs with experimental data for evaluation of crop models,\
    \ allowing users to compare\nsimulated outcomes with observed results, which is\
    \ critical if real-world decisions or recommendations\nare based on modeled results\
    \ [84]. Table 2 gathers a representative set of commercially available FMIS\n\
    programs speciﬁcally conﬁgured to deal with the usual data generated in the farm.\
    \ It includes the\nname of each application program, the company commercializing\
    \ it with its headquarters location,\nand the main features of the program. The\
    \ table is focused on programs managing crop data as the\nprimary tool, and its\
    \ purpose is not the compilation of all available FMIS software, which would\n\
    be futile given the rate new applications are constantly released, but bringing\
    \ a proof of the global\neﬀort realized in the last decade to deploy Smart Farming\
    \ in actual farms, accelerating the move\nfrom academics to agribusiness. The\
    \ examples show that some smartphone and tablet applications\nalready include\
    \ complex features so that growers can insert data directly in the ﬁeld; other\
    \ companies,\non the contrary, prefer having a basic application for mobile devices\
    \ to increase complexity in the\ncloud-based desktop version. In the majority\
    \ of cases, it is not necessary to have wireless connection\nwhile the grower\
    \ is entering data in the ﬁeld, because as soon as the mobile device ﬁnds a wireless\n\
    connection to the internet, it synchronizes the data previously introduced by\
    \ the grower in the mobile\ndevice with the data safely stored in the cloud. Many\
    \ of the programs listed below oﬀer the option\nof upgrading the software depending\
    \ on speciﬁc grower needs, increasing the price accordingly.\nThe most advanced\
    \ tools include features for ﬁnancial and machinery management, help in the\n\
    decision-making process, release warnings, or even propose management advice.\
    \ In many cases, these\nsoftware applications are not only addressed to the grower\
    \ or producer, but also to other stakeholders in\nagriculture such as inputs suppliers,\
    \ service suppliers, and food distributors, which makes a diﬀerence\nfor Smart\
    \ Farming, where multiple agriculture agents are connected. Regarding exploitation\
    \ rights,\nvarious agricultural management systems have been patented, as the\
    \ software from The Climate Corp.\nto generate agriculture prescriptions [85],\
    \ which entered into partnership with AGCO Corporation in\n2017 [4]. Decisive\

    \ T: Technology); 2 PaaS: Platform as a service.\nThe use of commercial data management\
    \ systems, as the ones listed in Table 2, often implies\nthat producers need to\
    \ share their crop data with a software platform owned and run by private\ncompanies.\
    \ This fact creates some controversy regarding the ownership of the data. In the\
    \ Software\nServices Agreement (SSA), it is stated that the person or entity providing\
    \ the data to the farm\nmanagement software company shall own and retain all rights,\
    \ title and interest in and to their\ndata, so that the data belongs to the provider\
    \ [76]. However, when data are aggregated with other\ngrowers’ data, the combined\
    \ data typically become property of the software company [96]. The list of\napplications\
    \ included in Table 2 proves that there is a global interest in developing software\
    \ for farm\ndata management, and most of the features requested by end-users are\
    \ similar everywhere. This table\nalso gives an idea of the interest raised in\
    \ industry by software-based management systems. However,\nmany applications use\
    \ their own proprietary formats, which complicates the share of data among data\n\
    acquisition and processing systems. A standardization eﬀort is needed among software\
    \ developers\nand providers. The ADAPT toolkit of Table 2 [77] is an example of\
    \ how to face this challenge, as it\nprovides an open-source application that\
    \ eliminates a barrier to the broad use of Precision Agriculture\ndata by enabling\
    \ interoperability between diﬀerent hardware and software applications.\n3.4.\
    \ Stage IV: Decision-Making\nIn situations where many ﬁeld parameters need being\
    \ considered, people ﬁnd practical diﬃculties\nin managing complex information\
    \ to make eﬀective decisions. In such cases, artiﬁcial intelligence\n(AI) can\
    \ help with techniques like deep learning or neural networks, fuzzy logic, genetic\
    \ algorithms,\nor expert systems. AI, with its modelling and reasoning capabilities,\
    \ can play a key role in agriculture,\nhelping to make sense of all the data available.\
    \ Fuzzy logic, to name one example within AI, resembles\nhuman reasoning imitating\
    \ the way of making decisions that involve several possibilities instead of\n\
    ‘true’ or ‘false’ alternatives; this technique uses linguistic variables that\
    \ ﬁt well with the complexity\nof the challenges posed by the diversity of agricultural\
    \ decision making. According to Dengel [20],\nagriculture oﬀers a vast application\
    \ area for all kinds of AI core technologies as agents operating in\nuncontrolled\
    \ environments. Giusti and Marsili-Libellia [81] designed a fuzzy-based decision\
    \ support\nsystem (DSS) taking as input variables soil moisture and rain forecast\
    \ for kiwi, corn, and potato.\nSimilarly, the DSS developed by Navarro-Hellín\
    \ et al. [87] estimated weekly irrigation for citrus\norchards taking into account\
    \ climate and soil variables; in that work, real-time measurements from soil\n\
    Agronomy 2020, 10, 207\n14 of 21\nparameters in a closed-loop control scheme were\
    \ decisive to avoid the accumulative eﬀect due to errors\nin consecutive weekly\
    \ estimations, as the DSS was allowed to adapt to local perturbations. In the\n\
    same fashion, Lindsay Corporation (Omaha, Nebraska, USA) was awarded for its solution\
    \ FieldNET\nAdvisor™ [91] that provides irrigation management decisions for growers.\
    \ DSS may be more robust\nand reliable when diﬀerent variables are considered,\
    \ but some procedures remain controversial as\nobjectives can lead to diﬀerent\
    \ solutions at diﬀerent times based on the priority set by decision makers\nor\
    \ other people involved in the procedure [88].\nSrivastava and Singh [80] highlighted\
    \ the importance of incorporating the graphical part of GIS to\nDSS, which was\
    \ demonstrated for water management scenarios in India. The importance of using\n\
    GIS for agricultural DSS lies on using user-friendly graphical interfaces for\
    \ growers. The result of a\nquestionnaire distributed by VineScout project [36]\
    \ members to the attendees of a ﬁeld demonstration in\nPortugal (October 2019),\
    \ evidenced the high value given to graphical user interfaces (GUI). Considering\n\
    that the prototype is in research phase and not commercial yet, 84% of the attendees\
    \ concluded that\nthe robot GUI shown in Figure 4 was simple to understand and\
    \ easy to use (unpublished research).\nRupnik et al. [89] developed a cloud-based\
    \ system to allow growers upload their own data, utilize\nseveral data analysis\
    \ methods, and ﬁnally present their outputs as decisions to apply. This time,\
    \ their\nuse case focused on spray planning for ﬁghting against pests in vineyards\
    \ and orchards. Rose et al. [90]\nconducted a survey on DSS and arrived to the\
    \ conclusion that 15 factors were inﬂuential in convincing\nUK growers and advisers\
    \ to use DSS, including usability, cost-eﬀectiveness, performance, relevance to\n\
    user, and compatibility with compliance demands. In addition, they found that\
    \ 49% of UK farmers used\nsome kind of DSS, and the preferred ways of delivery\
    \ were software (28%), paper-based (22%) tools,\nand mobile apps (10%). These\
    \ results show that the use of software to manage decisions is growing,\nbut its\
    \ percentage is still low and comparable to those who preferred paper-based tools.\
    \ Choosing\nsoftware and mobile applications to make agricultural decisions may\
    \ be considered beneﬁcial because\ndigital tools increase management eﬃciency\
    \ when compared to paper-based tools; however, there is\nstill a long way to make\
    \ technology-based tools attractive enough—easy to understand, intuitive and\n\
    nice—for growers to adopt. On the producer side, it is important to have access\
    \ to proper training\nuntil these technologies can be comfortably managed.\nAgronomy\

    \ last step for closing the loop in the complete crop management cycle of Figure\
    \ 1 is the\nphysical actuation on the crop. Actuation is understood as executing\
    \ some action on the crop or\nrelated to it, and this can be done by making decisions\
    \ right after obtaining information (real-time\napplications) or in another moment\
    \ deferred in time (oﬀ-line). For farmers to execute decisions,\nthey need advanced\
    \ equipment that can receive orders from a computerized control unit. Variable\n\
    rate machines can execute a number of farming tasks driven by a smart system [60].\
    \ Variable rate\ntechnology (VRT) applied on site-speciﬁc crop management (SSCM)\
    \ has the potential to increase\nproﬁt and decrease environmental impact [61]\
    \ as only what is needed is actually applied. Colaço\nand Molin [92] conducted\
    \ a long-term study for six years with the goal of evaluating the eﬀects of\n\
    variable rate fertilization on fertilizer consumption, soil fertility, and yield\
    \ in citrus. The outcomes\nof comparing variable and uniform rates showed that\
    \ the former achieved higher yields while using\nless fertilizer: using nitrogen,\
    \ fruit yield (kg of oranges) respect to the amount of fertilizer resulted\nin\
    \ a 32% yield increase in ﬁeld 1, and 38% in ﬁeld 2. When using potassium, the\
    \ yield increase even\nreached 40% in ﬁeld 1. In the case of phosphorus, the growth\
    \ rate was approximately 20% for both\nﬁelds. A recent review led by Nawar et\
    \ al. [93] conﬁrmed that, when management zone delineation\ntechniques were used\
    \ for variable-rate nutrient application, farm eﬃciency increased in all cases\n\
    when compared to traditional uniform-rate applications, and environmental impacts\
    \ were reduced.\nMachinery manufacturers are leading the development of commercial\
    \ solutions implementing VRT.\nThomasson et al. [62] described commercial VRT\
    \ systems oﬀered by major agricultural machinery\nmanufacturers, like CLAAS, that\
    \ used the ISARIA crop sensor for the variable-rate application of\nnitrogen-based\
    \ fertilizer, or the CEBIS MOBILE ISOBUS, which, apart from having other Precision\n\
    Agriculture functions, it is a compatible terminal to integrate the ISARIA sensor.\
    \ Another promising\ntype of variable actuation is automatic diﬀerential harvesting\
    \ or variable rate harvesting (VRH),\nwhich attempts harvesting according to previously\
    \ deﬁned management zones. In specialty crops,\nSethuramasamyraja [40] worked\
    \ in diﬀerential harvesting for vineyards by using near-infrared sensors\nto determine\
    \ grape quality in the ﬁeld based on the anthocyanin content of berries. The three\
    \ steps for\nthis VRH system involved sensing the anthocyanin content of grapes,\
    \ using these data to produce\nquality map based on a threshold anthocyanin level,\
    \ and feeding the quality map to the harvester for its\ncommanding. CLAAS was\
    \ awarded for implementing VRH in combines and forage harvesters [91] by\nmerging\
    \ precision sensing technology with autonomous machine control. The goal was to\
    \ maximize\nproductivity and automatically optimize harvester performance, according\
    \ to the changing conditions\nof the soil, plants, grain, and humidity in the\
    \ harvested ﬁeld. A USDA statistical analysis conducted in\n2010 [3] showed that\
    \ variable rate technologies had positive, but small, rate adoptions of 1% due\
    \ to\ntheir diﬃculty of use. Apart from eﬃciency and utility, cost is also a critical\
    \ parameter to consider for\nthe adoption of this technology. In this sense, the\
    \ ubiquitous availability of low-cost electronics will\nfavor the introduction\
    \ of such digital applications. In fact, advances in autonomous driving technology\n\
    for cars, including object detection capabilities through multi-camera systems,\
    \ have already reduced\nthe cost of developing automated agricultural machines\
    \ [22].\n4. Discussion\nAfter the Industrial Revolution, mainly since the advent\
    \ of mechanization, and along the Green\nRevolution, humans and machines have\
    \ been eﬃciently collaborating for growing crops to feed people.\nHowever, to\
    \ face the population growth in the coming years, an extra eﬀort is needed to\
    \ succeed,\nnot only in feeding people by increasing productivity, but also in\
    \ doing it in the most eﬃcient and\nrespectful possible way, that is, producing\
    \ sustainably. To face this challenge, remarkable advances in\ntechnology have\
    \ been appearing over the last decades, in particular the access to reliable agricultural\n\
    data and advanced computer techniques to get the optimal meaning from them, eventually\
    \ obtaining\nmaximum beneﬁts while being respectful with the environment. This\
    \ new approach driven by digital\ntechnology implies that growers must act as\
    \ supervisors of their crops rather than laborers, in an attempt\nAgronomy 2020,\
    \ 10, 207\n16 of 21\nof avoiding repetitive, physically-demanding, and tedious\
    \ ﬁeld tasks. In this modern agronomical\nframework, DATA is the key, and the\
    \ information-based management cycle described above provides\nthe practical approach\
    \ that unites concept and tasks. The following points summarize some of the\n\
    speciﬁc ideas drawn from this study:\n•\nPrecision Agriculture, which consists\
    \ of applying what is needed when and where is needed,\nhas further improved the\
    \ eﬃciency of managing farms with the addition of data-based digital\nsystems\
    \ that increase the knowledge of producers about their ﬁelds; this is known as\
    \ Agriculture\n4.0 or Digital Farming. When these data-driven farms incorporate\
    \ robotics with AI algorithms to\ntheir systems, the overall concept is then referred\
    \ to as Agriculture 5.0. Some studies report that\nagricultural robots integrating\
    \ forms of AI can do certain tasks faster than humans [23]. Despite\nthere are\
    \ other studies that contradict this statement [63], robotics is a growing economy\
    \ and there\nexists a great potential for many applications within agriculture.\n\
    •\nA greater adoption of Digital Farming by professional growers is vital to not\
    \ only improving a\nfarm’s ﬁnancial performance, but also to meet the food needs\
    \ of an expanding population [6].\nSmall farms will steadily incorporate basic\
    \ technology whereas large ﬁelds will likely invest with\nsophisticated equipment,\
    \ but data-less intuition-driven management will no longer represent\nthe modus\
    \ operandi of professional farms in the future. This should be considered a source\
    \ of\nopportunities, especially for a new generation of young farmers used to\
    \ digital technology, who\nare the ones with the capacity to balance an aging\
    \ population in rural areas, mainly those in\nindustrialized countries.\n•\nAfter\
    \ the rapid growth of UAVs, a steady-state is being reached, mostly induced by\
    \ the fact that\ndata analysis and ground-truth validation has resulted far more\
    \ complex and delicate than image\nacquisition and platform handling. This has\
    \ promoted the expansion of proximal sensing and the\nexploration of combining\
    \ both data sources—aerial and terrestrial—for a better understanding of\nthe\
    \ physiology of plants and trees.\n•\nMaps, as the most common way to represent\
    \ agricultural data, would need to be standardized.\nIntensely-interpolated colored\
    \ maps are output by GIS, FMIS, and other software applications,\nbut at the time\
    \ of comparing data with the precision enough to grant statistical signiﬁcance,\
    \ it often\nbecomes an impossible mission without standardization. Figure 3, for\
    \ example, uses the ﬂat\nrepresentation provided by the local tangent plane (LTP)\
    \ and formatted in a regular grid. Other\nprograms use UTM projections, and there\
    \ are even images only given in geodetic coordinates.\nAt the need of overlapping\
    \ maps, it takes a big eﬀort to make all data compatible. Not only the\nway coordinates\
    \ are represented needs a standard, but also the units, intervals, and even colors\
    \ in\nwhich parameters are displayed. The combination of aerial and ground data,\
    \ for instance, will\ngreatly beneﬁt from such standardization in the way data\
    \ is visually displayed for the average\ngrower to understand.\n•\nTable 2 provides\
    \ a representative compilation of software applications for farm management.\n\
    The list is not exhaustive, and yet includes companies from four continents and\
    \ 14 countries,\nwhich provides evidence of the fact that agricultural digitalization\
    \ is in fact a global move.\n•\nRegarding variable rate applications, adoption\
    \ rates need to augment, and to do so, farmers must\nﬁnd by themselves the value\
    \ in this technology for their crops. Only after maintaining accurate\nspatial\
    \ records and analyzing ﬁeld data can eﬀective variable rate prescriptions be\
    \ created [39] to\naddress particular tasks.\n5. Conclusions\nThis analysis conﬁrms\
    \ that consistent knowledge about farms leads to optimal decisions.\nAgricultural\
    \ management systems can handle farm data in such a way that results are orchestrated\n\
    to address customized solutions for each farm. This aid for farmers in the form\
    \ of digital solutions\ncombines forces with robotics and artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ to launch the imminent idea of Agriculture\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 207\n17 of 21\n\
    5.0. After thirty years of great expectations—and disappointments—by the application\
    \ of robotics to\nagriculture, the timing seems right for the ﬁrst time. However,\
    \ in order to take the most advantages\nfrom Agriculture 5.0, deep training needs\
    \ to be delivered to users, ideally young farmers eager to\nlearn and apply modern\
    \ technologies to agriculture and granting a generational renewal still to come.\n\
    It seems to be the right time to move forward towards a modern and sustainable\
    \ agriculture that\nis capable of showing the full power of data-driven management\
    \ to face the challenges posed to\nfood production in the 21st Century. The evolution\
    \ to Agriculture 5.0 is in the agenda of most major\nfarm equipment makers for\
    \ the next decade, and therefore oﬀ-road equipment manufacturers will\nplay a\
    \ key role in this move if agricultural robots are considered as the next—smarter—generation\
    \ of\nfarm machines.\nAuthor Contributions: V.S.-R. and F.R.-M. contributed to\

    Introduction Blockchain technology is a financial technology (FinTech) which is
    first developed as the distributed ledgers for bitcoin. For some time, blockchain
    technology was overshadowed by the bitcoin phenomenon, but in current years it
    has started to attract attention in its own right and is becoming a core technology
    in the FinTech family (Du, Pan, Dorothy, Leidner, & Yinga, 2019). Many experts
    and academic researchers have realized that the impacts of blockchain extend beyond
    bitcoin and even beyond the financial industry to drive change in many businesses
    (Ølnes, Ubacht, & Janssen, 2017). Blockchain is one of the most promising advanced
    technologies in the overall FinTech field (Du et al., 2019). While it was first
    designed to serve as a distributed ledger for tracking bitcoin transactions, blockchain’s
    potential extends beyond bitcoin. Indeed it can change many business operations
    in both financial and other commercial domains (Kshetri, 2018; Underwood, 2016).
    A blockchain is a chain of data blocks each of which is created to record transactions.
    Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and
    transaction data (Du et al., 2019). While blockchain are now playing a significant
    role in financial innovations and is the backbone technology that is driving the
    Fintech revolution, the predominant usage of blockchain thus far has been in the
    area of payments. Payment instruments and payment systems have been developing
    and changing as a result of new advancements in technology and business processes,
    and the rapidlyincreasing demands of consumers. The main objective of any payment
    system is safe and smart transactions (Ali, Barrdear, Clews, & Southgate, 2014;
    Kshetri, 2018). The development of digital currencies or cryptocurrencies using
    blockchain technology is the latest revolution in the domain of money transfer.
    Cryptocurrencies utilize decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) networks, encryption
    techniques, cryptography and a public key infrastructure (PKI) in which pairs
    of public and private keys are used to secure transfer of data (Abramova & Böhme,
    2016). A further application for blockchain technology is that of the autonomous,
    self-governing and self-regulating infrastructure which is designed to facilitate
    a distributed autonomous organization (Beck, Czepluch, Lollike, & Malone, 2016;
    Chapron, 2017; Peters & Panayi, 2015; Wörner, von Bomhard, Schreier, and Bilgeri
    et al., 2016). Once fully realized, these distributed autonomous organizations,
    the archetype of distributed organizing, are expected to be fluid and digital
    in nature—without offices, managers, contracts, policies or payrolls, and without
    centralized strategic agendas (Barrett, Oborn, & Orlikowski, 2016). As far as
    technical aspects and shortcomings of blockchain technology are concerned, the
    phenomenon of decentralized currencies has already stimulated academic research
    (Andrychowicz, Dziembowski, Malinowski, & Mazurek, 2015; Decker & Wattenhofer,
    2013; Vasek, Thornton, & Moore, 2014). This research has prompted amendments and
    expansion (Barber, Boyen, Shi, & Uzun, 2012; Ben Sasson et al., 2014) of regulatory
    status and measures (Christopher, 2014; Stokes, 2012; Tu & Meredith, 2015) and
    economic analysis (Becker et al., 2013; Hileman, 2015; Mai, Bai, Shan, Wang, &
    Chiang, 2015). The concept of decentralized trust facilitates an alternative solution
    to traditional client-server architecture. The data and the actions do not need
    to be processed by the mediation of the central authority which is consequently
    not required for the alternative system. The result is that the transactions become
    irreversible and the cost of transactions is also reduced. Indeed, the requirement
    for trustworthy governments, private firms, mediators and counter parties is also
    eliminated because trust is now placed in the protocols and the infrastructure
    (Karafiloski & Mishev, 2017). Blockchain technologies are identified as the significant
    technical innovation in the digitalization of asset ownership. Besides providing
    a secure audit trail that cannot be corrupted, the blockchain has been described
    as a multipurpose programmable platform for managing ownership and contracts (Lindman,
    Rossi, & Tuunainen, 2017; Mattila, 2016). Blockchain can be described as a decentralized,
    transactional database technology that facilitates validated, tamper-resistant
    transactions that are consistent across a large number of network participants
    called nodes (Beck, Müller-Bloch, & King, 2018; Glaser, 2017). Blockchain can
    be characterized as a class of technologies (distributed ledger technologies)
    that give users confidence that archived information (e.g., a certificate) has
    not been altered either accidently or deliberately (Beck et al., 2018). Research
    suggests that blockchain has the capacity to reduce uncertainty, insecurity, and
    ambiguity in transactions by providing full transactional disclosure and by producing
    a single truth for all network participants (Beck et al., 2016; Nærland, Müller-Bloch,
    Beck, & Palmund, 2017). The latest advancements in the distributed transaction
    are mainly facilitated by the blockchain and fundamentallydistributed database
    technology (Lindman et al., 2017). Blockchain technology can build financial tools
    such as payments, smart contracts and trading records, and reduce undesirable
    dealings and their subsequent impact (Queiroza & Wamba, 2019). Furthermore, legal
    and public records, including voting or court records, are also considered potential
    use-cases in this technology (Hughes et al., 2019). Blockchain can serve as a
    transactional mechanism for ‘sharing economic’ services (Mainelli & Smith, 2015)
    as it solves the challenge of the trusted recording of large-scale P2P activities.
    Blockchains are expected to fundamentally transform economies and societies by
    lowering transaction costs and reducing the need for trusted third parties (Clemons,
    Dewan, Kauffman, & Weber, 2017; Iansiti & Lakhani, 2017). The importance of such
    a transactional mechanism increases with the emerging ‘Programmable World’, where
    an increasing number of physical objects (the Internet of Things) become programmable
    and connected to the Internet. The potential of blockchains to transform markets
    and societies has motivated public and private organizations to make significant
    investments in the development of applications that use the blockchain technology
    (Rossi, Mueller-Bloch, Thatcher, & Beck, 2019). Furthermore, blockchain technology
    has versatile uses beyond recording financial transactions. Blockchain’s can be
    used for storing medical records, concluding binding agreements, tracking the
    flow of goods, storing personal credit records, tracking the provenance of artwork,
    verifying payments through a supply chain, and much more (Milic, 2019). When it
    comes to blockchain technology market size, a recent report suggests that it will
    reach $7.59 billion by 2024. That’s a compound annual growth rate of 37.4 %. Such
    rapid market growth is explained by an increasing demand for this technology across
    all industries, from financial services, through consumer and industrial goods,
    all the way to media, telecom, transport, healthcare, and public services (Grand
    View Research, 2019). As a result of that, blockchain technology has spread to
    other sectors such as manufacturing (17.6 % of the market share), distribution
    and services (14.6 %), public sector (4.2 %), and infrastructure (3.1 %). Nearly
    every industry is exploring the use of blockchain technology to a significant
    extent (Budman, Hurley, Khan, & Gangopadhyay, 2019). According to research conducted
    by Pawczuk, Massey, and Schatsky (2018), the blockchain is a priority investment
    for many companies. Thirty-nine percent of respondents reported that their organizations
    would invest in excess of $5 million in the technology in the coming year. Collectively,
    important actors agree that blockchain could impact many aspects of our societies,
    including environmental sustainability (Chapron, 2017), healthcare (Gammon, 2018)
    and social networks (Ciriello, Beck, & Thatcher, 2018). While there is much in
    the form of grey literature regarding blockchain technology (Brandão, Sao Mamede,
    & Goncalves, 2018), we argue that the state-of-the-art of blockchain-enabled benefits,
    challenges, and functions has received limited attention in the form of rigorous
    and empirical academic studies. Zheng, Xie, Dai, Chen, and Wang (2016) and Casino,
    Dasaklisb, and Patsakisa (2019) state that the functions of blockchain’s are not
    covered to their full extent. However, there are reviews focused on the specific
    roles of blockchain including the development of decentralized and data-intensive
    applications (Casino et al., 2019), and managing big data in a decentralized fashion
    (Karafiloski & Mishev, 2017). Other reviews focus on security issues of the blockchain
    (Khan & Salah, 2017; Li, Jiang, Chen, Luo, & Wen, 2017; Meng, Tischhauser, Wang,
    Wang, & Han, 2018) and on its potential to enable trust and decentralization in
    service systems (Seebacher and Schüritz, 2017) and P2P platforms (Hawlitschek,
    Notheisen, & Teubner, 2018). Some technical aspects of the blockchain design such
    as its consensus protocol (Sankar, Sindhu, & Sethumadhavan, 2017), and other technical
    characteristics such as its usability, data integrity, and scalability have also
    been studied (Yli-Huumo, Ko, Choi, Park, & Smolander, 2016). Moreover, there are
    other studies that have focused largely on the currency application aspects of
    blockchains and the related security and privacy challenges (Bonneau et al., 2015;
    Conti, Lal, & Ruj, 2018; Khalilov & Levi, 2018; Mukhopadhyay et al., 2016). Clearly
    there are many areas that have the potential to be studied and explored further
    and a systematic review of the current blockchain-enabled state-of-the-art benefits,
    challenges, and functions (Beck et al., 2018) in particular for the financial
    sector will help identify these gaps. Overall, there is a lack of major academic
    studies and publications in this emerging field, despite the potential implications
    of this technology (Yli-Huumo et al., 2016). As per Elsevier’s Scopus database,
    the keyword ‘blockchain’ brings about only 331 documents (05.03.2018). Interestingly,
    threequarters of these articles were written in 2016. Moreover, since a finance
    or business-related theme is emphasized by only 2.5 percent of these articles,
    an urgent need exists for supplementary research to be carried out in this domain
    (Yli-Huumo et al., 2016). On the basis of our existing literature review, it appears
    that research gaps exit in the modern tools associated with blockchain technology
    (Lindman et al., 2017). That is, both the practical and theoretical views of blockchain
    technology need additional research studies (Du et al., 2019). The essentially
    decentralized nature of these payment systems and platforms are linked to a number
    of critical challenges (Lindman et al., 2017). For instance, how both privacy
    and trust can be assured in such a platform-mediated network, and how to determine
    and reduce the risks and challenges. Beneficial, reliable and more efficient services
    for consumers can only be realized with a better understanding of these challenges
    and subsequent benefits (Lindman et al., 2017). This paper explores opportunities
    where the deployment and use of blockchain technology is likely to transform,
    in particular, the financial sector. It addresses the background of blockchain
    technology and research methodologies; and a research classification framework
    is developed and proposed on the basis of our findings. 2. Blockchain technology
    background 2.1. Blockchain technology definition The blockchain is essentially
    a decentralized ledger that maintains transaction records on many computers simultaneously.
    Most cryptocurrencies use blockchain technology to record payment transactions.
    The Bitcoin network was developed with the blockchain technology as its underlying
    infrastructure (Abramova & Böhme, 2016). The advent of the blockchain has brought
    along with it a number of components and analogous terminologies that often cloud
    and confuse the discussion surrounding the technology and its implementation.
    Amongst them are the descriptions related to the grouping and publishing of transactions
    into distinct data structures called blocks that are cryptographically linked
    (chained) together and distributed in a peer-to-peer network to prevent tampering
    of previously published transactions (Beck et al., 2018). The transactions that
    are added to blocks must be validated by the nodes (miners) with consensus models
    determining which node gets the privilege of publishing the next block. Blocks
    can also support highly expressive, native smart contract capabilities through
    a collection of code and data that is deployed using cryptographically signed
    transactions on the blockchain network (e.g., Ethereum’s smart contracts, Hyperledger
    Fabric’s chaincode). The first blockchain was described and implemented by the
    pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto (The Economist, 2015). Nakamoto published his blockchain
    description in the paper ‘Bitcoin in 2008: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System’
    which set out the architecture for a decentralized, trust-less payment system.
    Bitcoin operates on blockchain technology (Seebacher & Schüritz, 2017), and this
    blockchain is built upon cryptographic technology (Pilkington, 2015). This blockchain
    technology is a sequential distributed database where a public ledger is used
    to store a complete transaction history in a (block) chain (Böhme, Christin, Edelman,
    & Moore, 2015; Tama, Kweka, Park, & Rhee, 2017; Van Alstyne, 2014; Zhao, Fan,
    & Jiaqi Yan, 2016). The Bitcoin blockchain records all Bitcoin transactions and
    all allied information (Bradberry, 2015). Indeed, the blockchain is a distributed
    public ledger comprising a complete, immutable record of all executed transactions
    (Karafiloski & Mishev, 2017). Whist blockchains and cryptocurrencies have been
    generally associated with each other, the blockchain technology has also recently
    become of significant interest to researchers and it is argued to be an even more
    revolutionizing phenomenon over and above its use in Bitcoin (Zhao et al., 2016)
    (see Fig. 1). Download : Download high-res image (264KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 1. Google trend search volume (Zhao et al., 2016). Within the blockchain,
    the security and validity of all transactions are ensured through all nodes within
    the P2P network holding a full record of the blockchain. Therefore, any successful
    attack to fraudulently alter the blockchain must target all copies of the blockchain
    across the total network – and this is considered infeasible (Seebacher & Schüritz,
    2017). New blocks containing new transactions are only accepted into the blockchain
    after agreed verification protocols have been followed. In the Bitcoin example,
    this protocol is called ‘proof-of-work’ and this is the only way that new transactions
    may be added (Nakamoto, 2008; Seebacher & Schüritz, 2017). Blockchain is both
    an economic and a technical transformation (Böhme et al., 2015; Liebenau & Elaluf-Calderwood,
    2016; Zyskind, Nathan, & Pentland, 2015; Zhao et al., 2016). As a technical transformation,
    the blockchain is a new form of database system—particularly for decentralized
    environments of inadequate trust. As an economic innovation, blockchain offers
    tools to any problem domain where a dependable record of transactions is needed,
    and where parties—whether machines or humans—cannot be fully trusted (Lindman
    et al., 2017). Based on the earlier discussion, the following definition for a
    blockchain is developed: A blockchain is a distributed database model reliant
    on a P2P network. It encompasses a sequence of blocks, with time-stamped transactions
    that are confirmed by the network community and are secured by public-key infrastructure
    (PKI). Within the blockchain, an element cannot be changed once it becomes part
    of that blockchain. As a result, a blockchain provides an indisputable record
    of previous actions. 2.2. Blockchain technology characteristics The two main principle
    characteristics to be identified when examining blockchain technology are trust
    and decentralization (Seebacher & Schüritz, 2017; Tama et al., 2017) (see Fig.
    2). Accordingly, both these blockchain technology characteristics are addressed
    next. Download : Download high-res image (288KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 2. Blockchain technology characteristics (Seebacher & Schüritz, 2017).
    2.2.1. Trust The noteworthy feature of the blockchain is hidden in its decentralized
    approach (Seebacher & Schüritz, 2017). Specifically, there is no dependence on
    a third party by the users in securing one’s transactions and assets since the
    network is protected by the proof-of-work protocol, thereby eliminating the need
    to trust any middleman for verifying and recording transactions (Böhme et al.,
    2015; Crosby, Nachiappan, Pattanayak, Verma, & Kalyanaraman, 2016). The entire
    blockchain code is open source and is available for anyone to view, thus removing
    any possibility of backdoors being built into the system. This ensures that individuals
    can act as their own bank and control decisions in ensuring their capital is safe.
    This is contrasted with the traditional banking environment, where the bank is
    responsible for customers’ money (Hull et al., 2016; Ølnes et al., 2016). There
    are a few terms that clearly explain the trust in blockchain technology (see Fig.
    2), for instance, public and shared interaction (Beck et al., 2016; Bonneau et
    al., 2015; Cai & Zhu, 2016; Sun, Yan, & Zhang, 2016); peer verification of transactions
    (Eyal, Gencer, Sirer, & van Renesse, 2016; Garman, Green, & Miers, 2014; Kosba,
    Miller, Shi, Wen, & Papamanthou, 2016; Tschorsch & Scheuermann, 2016); low friction
    in providing information (Beck et al., 2016; Böhme et al., 2015; Sun et al., 2016);
    and security through cryptography (Sun et al., 2016; Xu, 2016; Zyskind et al.,
    2015). 2.2.2. Decentralization One of the key attributes of blockchain technology
    is decentralization, through which censorship resistance and immutability are
    realized (Seebacher & Schüritz, 2017). Among its salient features, a blockchain
    provides a platform where reliance on a centralized third party for the safety
    of one’s assets is no longer required (Tama et al., 2017). A government or hacker
    cannot infiltrate the centralized ledger for personal use because of the distributed
    and decentralized nature of the blockchain. Proof-of-work solves complicated mathematical
    issues with the help of computing power. In addition, proof of work is the well-known
    consensus system currently employed to harmonize hundreds of thousands of decentralized
    nodes. As a result, there is surety about safety of assets; and any arbitrary
    dilution of money supply is prevented (Seebacher & Schüritz, 2017). A few significant
    terms clearly explain the decentralization in blockchain technology, for example,
    pseudonymity of participants (Bonneau et al., 2015; Garman et al., 2014; Zyskind
    et al., 2015); the potential use of automation (Guo & Liang, 2016; Xu, 2016);
    redundancy of data (Beck et al., 2016; Hull et al., 2016); and peers’ participation
    in development ‘versatility’ (Xu, 2016; Zhao et al., 2016). 2.3. Blockchain technology
    categories The three general classifications of blockchains are public, consortium
    and private (Mattila, 2016; Sankar et al., 2017; Xu et al., 2016). Within the
    public blockchain is concerned, every party has equal rights and privileges—that
    is, there is no centralized authority (Guo & Liang, 2016; Sankar et al., 2017;
    Xu et al., 2016). At this point, everyone has the authority to enter or exit.
    This particular category is free for all and a transaction can be validated by
    anyone, for example, Bitcoin (Guo & Liang, 2016). In the consortium blockchain,
    transactions cannot be validated by everyone (Guo & Liang, 2016; Xu et al., 2016).
    Validation of transactions is confined to only a few key members (Zheng et al.,
    2016). The rest have the option to validate, however, these nominated people must
    reach an agreement prior to implementation. The private blockchain follows a centralized
    configuration (Guo & Liang, 2016). A single entity is authorized for decision-making
    with the command and control of the validation process (Xu et al., 2016). The
    centralized head will ensure that the consensus that is followed is the one proposed
    (Zheng et al., 2016). This is akin to having a centralized body such as governments
    in different nations. Table 1 provides a comparison between the three general
    classifications of blockchain technology (public, consortium, and private). Table

    al., 2016; Poon & Dryja, 2016). 2.4. Impact of blockchain technology on the financial
    sector For financial service providers, a concerning situation has developed as
    a result of increased regulation and lack of economic growth since 2008, and the
    ensuing financial crisis. Consequently, advanced technologies are continuously
    being employed by the financial sector as these technologies tend to assist in
    improving transparency and enhancing security, thus resulting in cost saving and
    efficiency (Schneider et al., 2017). Blockchain have attracted attention in recent
    years because they have the potential to facilitate the automation and streamlining
    of processes, eliminate manual back office labour, reduce time, enhance transparency
    and improve security (Walker, Burton, & Cantara, 2016). Trust has remained a main
    challenge in the establishment of digital payments (Shaw, 2014; Tsiakis & Sthephanides,
    2005; Yan & Yang, 2015). Particular research concerning Mobile payment has argued
    the need for trusted service managers involved in handling the authentication,
    authorization and account settlement (Ondrus & Pigneur, 2009), with a special
    focus on the effects of direct and indirect network. Based on P2P networks, distributed
    transaction platforms provide a solution to this challenge with the help of radical
    decentralization. These are known as ‘cryptocurrencies’ or ‘decentralized digital
    currencies’ and decentralized consensus systems (Glaser & Bezzenberger, 2015).
    The growth and the effects of new payment platforms can better be understood through
    the information systems (ISs) studies on open platforms (Aksulu & Wade, 2010;
    Ghazawneh & Henfridsson, 2013). These studies offer approaches for enhancing third
    party participation (Tiwana, Konsynski, & Bush, 2010). The governance of open
    source development communities has also been discussed in earlier research (Lindman
    et al., 2017; Nyman, 2015). Governance in this context focuses upon how to acquire
    the direction, coordination and control of partially or completely autonomous
    individuals and organizations (Markus, 2017). Governance has been addressed by
    the open source research in three different ways: (1) several enticements for
    autonomous developers to take part in open efforts (Lerner & Tirole, 2002; Von
    Krogh, Haefliger, Spaeth, & Wallin, 2012); (2) maintaining support for essential
    coordination activities (Crowston, Wei, Li, Eseryel, & Howison, 2005; Lindman
    et al., 2017); and (3) developing a culture that welcomes open contributions (Markus,
    2017). While still an emerging technology, distributed payment platforms are close
    to gaining widespread recognition. For instance, Japan was reflecting on the legal
    implications in 2016 as a result of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies being treated
    as currencies (Lindman et al., 2017). There are generally unresolved questions
    regarding payment platforms and digital payments, for example, payment ecosystems
    and trust issues. In addition, a new set of unaddressed research challenges have
    emerged because of the decentralized nature of blockchain technology wherein different
    services and platforms are designed, developed and ultimately used. New digital
    payment systems are being launched specifically to cater for the need for banking
    services; and the new systems do not currently handle the previously non-existent
    needs. As per the findings of previous studies, competing with well-known prevailing
    trends within the banking sector—which is heavily regulated by rules and regulations—has
    become extremely difficult, (Dahlberg et al., 2008; Reuver et al., 2015). According
    to Reuver et al. (2015), a remarkable historical example from an institutional
    environment has been presented: new payment systems by using blockchain technology
    were not only meant to reduce cash payments, but the banks also view this setup
    as a safe and secure method of handling consumer payments. Moreover, mobile operators
    aspire to benefit from increased revenue by using SIM cards for payer identification.
    Negotiations on pricing, openness, etc. of the platform strategy were directly
    affected by the conflicting goals. Consequently, a challenging battle is being
    faced by the new digital payment platforms using blockchain technology in the
    heavily-regulated financial sector (Lindman et al., 2017). 3. Research methodology
    Due to the number of rapidly emerging financial publications, investigating relevant
    articles for evidence-based practice is not a manageable task for financial experts
    (Bastian et al., 2010). Furthermore, financial experts should show caution in
    their decision-making based on certain studies which may be inconclusive due to
    certain biases in these studies (Abbas, Raza, & Ejaz, 2008). These experts must
    seek strong facts from the research so that evidence-based practice can be followed.
    Subsequently, systematic reviews are promoted in this connection as one of the
    strongest areas of evidencebased financial practice (Evans, 2003). Consequently,
    systematic studies are found applicable since the summarized research implications
    that emerge on a given topic are considered to be reliable and valid in comparison
    to controlled trials or case studies. Through systematic reviews, the researcher
    is able to ascertain, assess, understand and produce the available research, and
    to reach logical conclusions based on the findings of the reviews (Dikert, Paasivaara,
    & Lassenius, 2016; Victor, 2008). Provision of evidence in a clear manner aimed
    at improving the consistency and validity of the research findings is a key objective
    of the systematic review (Coren & Fisher, 2006; Kitchenham & Charters, 2007).
    A staged process is followed when embarking on a systematic review: review scope
    is defined initially and questions and protocol are scrutinized; the evidence
    is then selected; and, subsequently, the researchers perform a quality appraisal
    of evidence, data acquisition and synthesis (Petticrew & Roberts, 2006). While
    performing a systematic literature review, the guidelines are significant in encouraging
    researchers (Kitchenham & Charters, 2007). The guidelines and the procedures described
    by Tranfield, Denyer, and Smart (2003), Kitchenham and Charters (2007) and Ali,
    Shrestha, Soar, and Wamba (2018) are followed in the systematic review presented
    in this study. Planning, execution and reporting are the three phases used in
    this research study. Fig. 3 illustrates the steps followed during each phase.

    Fig. 3. Research systematic review process. (Adapted from Tranfield et al., 2003;
    Kitchenham & Charters, 2007; Ali et al., 2018). 3.1. Planning phase The identification
    of the need for a systematic review is the first step. As already discussed, although
    the research in use of blockchain technology in the financial sector is relatively
    limited in the literature, there is no review encapsulating all the studies that
    explore blockchain technology in the financial sector to provide a better understanding
    of this essential research area. The development of the research review protocol
    is the second step. The existing blockchainenabled financial research can be better
    understood through this systematic review protocol. To perform a systematic review
    within the relevant journal articles for research on blockchain technology in
    the financial sector, experts have developed a review protocol to explain a research
    classification framework initially developed by Ngai and Wat (2002). Blockchain
    is a comparatively new, complex and unique experience. Consequently, this review
    study has adjusted the classification scheme of Yang and Tate (2012). Benefits,
    challenges and functions are the three dimensions of the classification framework.
    We shall incorporate specific categories within each dimension. Our final research
    framework (see Fig. 4) consists of blockchain-enabled financial benefits encompassing
    advantages to people, organizations, technology, economics and policy. Blockchain-enabled
    financial challenges comprise financial, regulation, operational and adoption
    challenges. Finally, blockchain-enabled financial functions include point-to-point
    transmission, data ownership, data sharing, data protection and distributed innovations.

    Fig. 4. Research classification framework. (Developed from Yang & Tate, 2012).
    As shown in Fig. 4, the nature of blockchain research, the literature review,
    the study performed by Barki, Rivard, and Talbot (1993)) and the existing classification
    schemes of ISs (Alavi & Carlson, 1992; Ngai & Wat, 2002) have helped develop the
    research classification framework. The following sections will explain the classification
    framework dimensions and their categories. 3.1.1. Benefits dimension People, organization,
    technology, economics, and policy are the five different categories of this dimension.
    The topics of trust, sharing and privacy are collected under the people’s benefits
    category. In addition, the category of benefit to organization has topics on decentralization,
    fast transaction and peer-to-peer. The technological benefits category comprises
    literature on network security and smart contracts. The category financial advantages
    cover speculating opportunities and the literature on low transaction cost. Last
    of all, the literature on data storage management is included in the category
    of policy-related benefit. 3.1.2. Challenges dimension Financial, regulation,
    operational and adoption aspects comprise this dimension. Security incidents and
    literature concerning weaknesses of exchanges fall under financial challenges.
    The literature relating to the lack of universal regulation of the blockchain
    falls under regulation challenges. Moreover, literature on wasted resources and
    scalability comes under operational challenges. Last of all, the literature on
    interoperability and standards encompasses adoption-related challenges. 3.1.3.
    Functions dimension The point-to-point transmission, data ownership, data sharing,
    data protection, and distributed innovations are among the categories of this
    dimension. The literature on payment processes is covered in the point-to-point
    transmission. The literature on credit resources is included in the data ownership.
    The literature on data automatic recording comes under data sharing. The literature
    on privacy protection forms part of data protection, and, as a final point, distributed
    innovations entail information about smart contracts. The third step in the planning
    phase is the definition of the research questions. It is a critical step in every
    systematic review. By answering the research questions, the literature review
    essentially accomplishes the objectives. The research questions emanating from
    the present systematic review are stated below: • What are the tangible and expected
    benefits of the implementation of blockchain technology for the financial sector?
    • What are the critical challenges faced in the implementation of blockchain technology
    in the financial sector? • What are the current and common areas of blockchain-enabled
    financial sector functions? • What are the results of previous studies and their
    implications in guiding the forthcoming investigation? The definition of the strategies
    for the selection of papers is the fourth step in the planning phase. In this
    step, researchers have adopted a combined search method. This combined search
    method covers a broad automated search of online databases, manual review, and
    the backward snowball technique. The selection of the most suitable digital sources
    forms part of the broad automated search technique (Golder, Loke, & Zorzela, 2014).
    The digital sources that were selected for this systematic review are the digital
    libraries of: Science Direct, Emerald, Scopus, ACM Digital, IEEE, and AIS e-library.
    In addition, significant filtering tools were applied to restrict the desirable
    research results (Aleixandre-Benavent, González Alcaide, González De Dios, & Alonso-Arroyo,
    2011). Analyzing the abstract and the title of the research initially was part
    of the broad manual review (Golder et al., 2014; Higgins & Green, 2011; Pucher,
    Boot, & De Vries, 2013). Subsequently, researchers scrutinized the full articles
    to filter out inappropriate articles (Hu & Bai, 2014; Pucher et al., 2013; Shea
    et al., 2007). To uncover articles unable to be located from the first method,
    the researchers employed the backward snowball technique. Using the reference
    list to find new articles for inclusion is known as the backward snowballing technique
    (Wohlin, 2014). In this step, the method involves using the reference list, as
    well as eliminating articles not meeting the basic criteria, for example, language,
    publication year and type of publication. Dismissal of the previouslyscrutinized
    articles from the list is the next step. Upon their removal, the remaining articles
    become strong contestants for inclusion. These steps in the backward snowballing
    ensure that the research scholar has extracted the maximum information from the
    article under investigation and if an existing article becomes devoid of providing
    any information required by the scholar, then he/she can consult other sources
    (if desired) (Webster & Watson, 2002; Wohlin, 2014). The likelihood that the systematic
    review covers significant articles is increased by the amalgamation of the two
    techniques. 3.2. Execution phase In the execution phase, the selection strategies
    are applied to help filter the overall publication results down to achieve the
    selection of relevant articles. As summarized below, six techniques are followed
    in this systematic review research. • The resolve of search terms is a repetitive
    process, where we set off with the different search terms that are used for trial
    searches (Golder et al., 2014; Hu & Bai, 2014; Higgins & Green, 2011). When the
    initial set of already-known articles is obtained, then the procedure for determining
    search terms comes to an end. Using sophisticated search strings, together with
    relevant Boolean operators and all the aforementioned online databases, can assist
    us in this regard. The ‘Blockchain’ and ‘Finance Sector’ is the search string
    used in the existing literature. • Researchers applied the filters for each database
    to limit the desirable research results (Aleixandre-Benavent et al., 2011). As
    it is already known that a large number of articles were produced from the initial
    search, the number of articles was then narrowed down based on the type of document,
    selected year of publication and research area. • To reject the irrelevant articles
    from search results, the researchers manually checked all the search results to
    confirm the relevancy and the correctness of the title and the abstract of the
    articles (Golder et al., 2014; Higgins & Green, 2011; Pucher et al., 2013). •
    The researchers examined the complete articles to identify relevant information
    (Hu & Bai, 2014; Pucher et al., 2013; Shea et al., 2007). • To find articles that
    were not recognized from the first method, researchers employed the backward snowball
    technique (Hu & Bai, 2014; Spanos & Angelis, 2016). • Ultimately, researchers
    defined the quality assessment criteria, so that the accomplishment of an acceptable
    level of quality could be assured (Hu & Bai, 2014; Spanos & Angelis, 2016). Moreover,
    they established a high-quality checklist to evaluate whether or not an article
    should be included in the research. The assessment questions adopted from Kitchenham
    (2004), Petticrew and Roberts (2008) and Spanos and Angelis (2016) made up the
    check list. In addition, the research objective, clear statement of the research
    problem, the description and availability of data, description of the methodology
    implemented, presentation of the research results and applicability of the research
    findings to answer the research question are among the factors included in the
    checklist. The final review comprised articles fulfilling all these conditions.

    92 87 This systematic review search was conducted from December 2017 until June
    2018 and followed the protocol as discussed in the planning phase. The initial
    keyword search resulted in 749 articles. After applying all the steps reported
    earlier, 87 articles were finally chosen for further investigation and reporting.
    3.3. Reporting phase After the development of the review protocol, all the predefined
    steps of the systematic review were executed. In Table 2, the steps leading to
    the final number of selected articles of this systematic review are illustrated.
    Specifically, after the initial search (keywords) process, 749 articles were found.
    The researchers then applied database filters (tools) to reduce the initial search
    results. As a result of this procedure, 522 articles were removed, and the number
    of remaining articles was 227. After reading titles and abstracts of the candidate
    articles to identifying irrelevant articles or duplicates, 90 articles were removed,
    and the number of remaining articles was 137. Next, after reading full articles,
    58 irrelevant articles were removed. The final number of selected articles resulting
    from the search was 79. The backward snowball technique was subsequently applied
    and from the reading of the references, 13 more articles were added, and the number
    increased to 92 articles. Finally, after checking the quality assessment criteria,
    5 articles were removed, reducing the number of articles to 87. Consequently,
    the final number of articles after the entire study selection process was 87.
    3.4. Research results and classification of papers The findings of a detailed
    review of blockchain technology enabled financial sector related articles to be
    put forward and examined. The categorization framework was applied by considering
    three components: blockchain-enabled financial benefits, challenges, and functions.
    The selected articles for this research study are outlined in Table 3, based on
    the categorization framework. Table 3. Classification of accepted articles. Dimension

    the overall number of selected articles across the years that we scanned in this
    research review. It is evident that the number of publications related to blockchain
    technology has increased significantly since the technology first appeared in
    2008. It is also worth mentioning that blockchain technology has fascinated researchers
    as this innovation brings the possibility of cooperatively producing and maintaining
    transactions in the network. We established that the highest number of articles
    was published in 2016 with 29 articles; and the lowest number of articles was
    published in 2013 with only 2 articles (see Fig. 5). Download : Download high-res

    Fig. 8. Distributions of research articles. 4. Research proposition This section
    discusses the benefits, challenges, and functions of blockchain technology-based
    systems that need further consideration, analysis and research—particularly in
    the financial sector. As blockchain technology development and applications cover
    a wide range of areas, future research directions can be diverse. To maximize
    the benefits of the blockchain systems for decision-making in the financial sector,
    three research propositions are offered that are based on the following areas:
    blockchain enabled financial sector benefits, blockchain enabled financial sector
    challenges, and blockchain enabled financial sector functions. 4.1. Blockchain
    enabled financial sector benefits Blockchain technology is expected to bring significant
    benefits to consumers, to the current banking systems, and to society in general.
    Beyond the security implications and increased transparency of transactions for
    all parties, either institutions or customers, it can have a beneficial impact
    on pricing and costs in the market (Glaser, Zimmerman, Haferkorn, Weber, & Siering,
    2014; Hur, Jeon, & Yoo, 2015). Such benefits can be identified, simulated and
    analyzed as the technology evolves and matures. Blockchain also provides the opportunity
    to maintain secure payment histories of the customers across different banks in
    different regions and thus reduce the risk of fraud (Zohar, 2015; Gao et al.,
    2015; Lindman et al., 2017). Other benefits include greater transparency, improved
    traceability, and increased speed of transactions. All benefits require in-depth
    study and empirical evaluations for different use cases and applications. Consequently,
    the following proposition is offered: Proposition 1 Measuring the benefits of
    blockchain technology and its impact on the financial sector is very difficult.
    Therefore, there is a need to develop theoretically sound and practically feasible
    blockchain technology impact indicators that relate to people, organizations,
    technology, economics, and policy to measure its benefits. Fig. 9 sets out the
    distribution of blockchain enabled financial sector benefit articles in relation
    to people, organization, technology, economics and policy, and shows that the
    highest number of current publications related to the benefits to the economy
    (21 articles). The lowest number of publications concerns issues relating to the
    benefits to policy (6 articles). The following sections provide a detailed discussion
    about the benefits to people, organization, technology, policy and economics.

    4.1.1. People As far as the cyber world is concerned, transactions take place
    among unknown people. The cyberspace field is using the reputation system. Through
    the use of this system, people are able to evaluate the reliability of a potential
    seller (Cai & Zhu, 2016). Furthermore, the amount of data globally is rapidly
    increasing (Zyskind et al., 2015). In the Big Data era, data is continuously being
    gathered and evaluated, which results in revolution and financial prosperity (Zyskind
    et al., 2015). Different organizations are using the data to personalize services,
    predict future trends and improve corporate decision-making processes. The most
    precious asset of our economy is the data (Schwab, Marcus, Oyola, Hoffman, & Luzi,
    2011). Blockchain has captured the attention of people from many industries such
    as property management, auditing, and copyright protection; however, the leading
    application area of the technology is now none other than the financial sector
    (Zhao et al., 2016; Zhu & Zhou, 2016). As part of human society, research on blockchain
    technology is projected to address the issues of sharing (Mainelli & Smith, 2015;
    Zhao et al., 2016), trust (Shaw, 2014; Yan & Yang, 2015), and privacy (Schwab
    et al., 2011; Zhao et al., 2016; Zheng et al., 2016). A key feature that the blockchain
    can offer for a transaction is trust. Thus, people may be able to share information
    without compromising confidentiality with the help of new trust mechanisms (Karafiloski
    & Mishev, 2017). Trust in transactions can be improved without interference from
    a third-party as a result of the blockchain (Deshpande, Stewart, Lepetit, & Salil,
    2017). Consequently, end-users themselves have control over their own transactions
    and data, as the centralized database is not storing data which is prone to being
    hacked (Shackelford and Myers, 2016). A decentralized personal data management
    system assuring the ownership of data was proposed by Zyskind et al. (2015). In
    this setup, data transparency, the ability to audit, and finely administered access
    controls can be used to protect private and personal data. 4.1.2. Organization
    Core to blockchain technology is that a business community can be P2P and decentralized
    (Abramova & Böhme, 2016; Barber et al., 2012; Lindman et al., 2017; Mainelli &
    Smith, 2015; Seebacher & Schüritz, 2017). Moreover, there also can be fast transactions
    (Zohar, 2015; Gao et al., 2015; Lindman et al., 2017). The Bitcoin system is an
    example of a decentralized organization, where no central authority exits to handle
    the issue (Ali et al., 2014; Böhme et al., 2015; Krombholz, Judmayer, Gusenbauer,
    & Weippl, 2016; Zohar, 2015). There are usually P2P relationships amongst the
    nodes in the blockchain system (Abramova & Böhme, 2016). 4.1.3. Technology The
    network security (Abramova & Böhme, 2016; Malinova & Park, 2016) and smart contract
    (Knezevic, 2018; Pinna & Ruttenberg, 2016; Zhao et al., 2016) are the technical
    tools fundamental to the blockchain system. As far as the smart contract is concerned,
    the auto execution of code enables the organization to be self-sufficient. Network
    security is the core component of this feature, where people can trust the system
    for business transactions (Gao et al., 2015; Van Alstyne, 2014). According to
    a research by Xu (2016), the security mechanism based on distributed consensus
    and public ledger is one of the fundamental attributes of the blockchain. The
    author describes the bad practices and types of fraud which blockchain technology
    can prevent. The author defines threats to the blockchain while also recommending
    appropriate defensive measures to fight against such threats and dangers. Because
    of its distributed nature and the absence of a central point of failure, the flexibility
    of systems and data storage can be enhanced with blockchain technology (Mills
    et al., 2016). Research conducted by Mainelli (2017) expounded the opportunities
    offered by this type of technology. The author pointed out that in the event of
    failure, everyone can retain their own copy of data and transactions since blockchain
    technology is not centralized. This form of resilience and security provides the
    opportunity to create new identity systems where users own the data which remains
    universally consistent and cannot be destroyed (Mainelli & Vinay, 2016). Blockchain
    can potentially help to improve the security in distributed networks. Noyes (2016)
    proposed a novel anti-malware environment named BitAV from which users can distribute
    the virus patterns on the blockchain. This research showed that BitAV can enhance
    the fault reliability to improve the scanning speed. The reliability of security
    infrastructure can also be improved due to this blockchain technology. For example,
    conventional public key infrastructures (PKIs) are often susceptible to single
    point of failure due to hardware and software flaws or malicious attacks (Zheng
    et al., 2016). As demonstrated by Axon (2015), blockchain can be used to construct
    a privacy-aware PKI, while simultaneously improving the reliability of conventional
    PKIs. 4.1.4. Economics As per the economic cost-benefit analysis, potential reasons
    for interest in the blockchain are speculation opportunities (Glaser et al., 2014;
    Hur et al., 2015) and seemingly low transaction costs (Ali et al., 2014; Barber
    et al., 2012; Böhme et al., 2015; Zohar, 2015; Gao et al., 2015; Van Alstyne,
    2014; Beer & Weber, 2014; Zhu & Zhou, 2016; Karafiloski & Mishev, 2017; Li & Wang,
    2017; Kenzevic, 2018). Theoretically, fees are discretionary and paid out to a
    successful miner. However, on the practical side, the blockchain transactions
    are charged a fee, which can be explained by a default value arranged in the usual
    client software (Abramova & Böhme, 2016; Möser & Böhme, 2015). Compared to traditional
    payment options, Bitcoin fees are typically lower than the charges levelled at
    individuals when making international payments and transfers, however cost savings
    in case of local retail purchases are not always apparent (Böhme et al., 2015;
    Van Alstyne, 2014). An opportunity for trading and contemplating activity on exchange
    markets is offered by the variable exchange rates between sanctioned currencies
    and the Bitcoin (Abramova & Böhme, 2016). By exploiting the price volatility,
    many users are acquiring Bitcoins simply to hold them until there is an escalation
    of the exchange rates (Böhme et al., 2015). Consequently, the debate continues
    about the status of Bitcoin as merely an investment tool (store-of-value) or a
    digital currency (means of exchange) (Glaser et al., 2014; Hur et al., 2015).
    In addition to enabling the development of markets and products that were earlier
    unprofitable or unavailable, blockchain is a disruptive technology offering the
    likelihood of reengineering economic models (EM-Compass, 2017). New business models
    could be enabled with the implementation of the blockchain. The P2P transactions
    could take advantage of the transfer of assets without involving a third party
    and, therefore assist in the development of the ‘sharing economy’ (Tapscott &
    Tapscott, 2016). Through the establishment of new types of financial institutions,
    new entrants (for example, the unbanked) could participate in economic activities
    from which they are currently denied (Mills et al., 2016; Tapscott & Tapscott,
    2016; Government Office for Science, 2016). 4.1.5. Policy The main policy components
    underlying the blockchain system include management of access policies and references
    to users’ data (Zyskind et al., 2015), management of data storage contracts (Vorick
    & Champine, 2014), management of document storage contracts (Bocovich, Doucette,
    & Goldberg, 2015), management of metadata of data kept in a storage systems (Conoscenti,
    Vetro, & De Martin, 2016; Cram, D’Arcy, & Proudfoot, 2019), automatic compensation
    to clients of a storage server in the case of stored data being lost (Ateniese
    et al., 2014), and an immutable log when storing metadata of messages of decentralized
    applications (Conoscenti et al., 2016). 4.2. Blockchain enabled financial sector
    challenges There are some significant challenges that blockchain technology needs
    to overcome before it becomes mainstream in the financial sector. These challenges
    include scalability (Conoscenti et al., 2016; Yli-Huumo et al., 2016), total time
    for the verification of the transactions (latency) (Moore & Christin, 2013), security
    (Eyal & Sirer, 2014; Karame, Androulaki, & Capkun, 2012), meeting regulatory challenges
    (Reid & Harrigan, 2013; Trautman, 2014), and transaction cost (Moore & Christin,
    2013). Consequently, the following proposition is offered: Proposition 2 There
    are a set of critical financial, regulation, operational, and adoption challenges
    that will significantly affect blockchain’s success in the financial sector. Fig.
    10 sets out the distribution of articles on blockchain enabled financial sector
    challenges in relation to financial, regulatory, operational and adoption challenges;
    and shows that the highest number of current publications is within the operational
    challenges (11 articles). The lowest number of publications is within the adoption
    challenges (5 articles). The following sections will discuss the findings and
    challenges relating to financial, regulation, operational and adoption aspects.

    Fig. 10. Distribution of articles relating to blockchain enabled financial sector
    challenges. 4.2.1. Financial challenges The remote wallets, currency exchanges
    or transaction tools that shield activity on the internet to render them untraceable
    are examples of third-party financial mediators in the blockchain ecosystem (Moore
    & Christin, 2013). In research conducted by Moser, Rainer, and Dominic (2014)
    they identify that with the blockchain ‘Bitcoin’ as a global Internet currency,
    involvement of some mediators is essential. The interested individuals cannot
    buy Bitcoins in the absence of exchanges serving as a platform for the buyers
    and the sellers. Because of potential security vulnerabilities of systems, the
    mediators unavoidably represent their clients to mitigate risk (Eyal & Sirer,
    2014; Karame et al., 2012). For instance, after losing about 754,000 of its customers’
    bitcoins after a massive hack, the largest bitcoin exchange—Mt. Gox—closed its
    business in 2014 (Böhme et al., 2015). Furthermore, bitcoins could be lost due
    to a user’s own unplanned actions, for example, typos in forgotten passwords,
    transactions or security defects of devices used (Brezo & Bringas, 2012; Grant
    & Hogan, 2015; Vasek, Bonneau, Castellucci, Keith, & Moore, 2016). 4.2.2. Regulation
    challenges The technology revolution is followed by the regulatory entities, which
    is certainly the case with blockchain (Peter, 2017). The blockchain transactions
    is giving rise to new services, however, laws are absent in regulating transactions
    (De Filippi, 2014; Trautman, 2014). Even though auditability and transparency
    are promised benefits of blockchain, developing new regulations for blockchain
    might meet the needs of highlyregulated industries (Guo & Liang, 2016; Nguyen,
    2016). There is a need to reshape the information-sharing regulations for encouraging
    companies to adopt the technology, as well as their customers and their investors.
    Governments should introduce laws that encompass the smart contracts of the blockchain
    (Peter, 2017; Yin, Langenheldt, Harlev, Mukkamala, & Vatrapu, 2019). One of the
    key concerns for start-ups and banks investigating the distributed ledgers is
    the regulation scope (Grinberg, 2011; Reid & Harrigan, 2013). Blockchain technology
    is still in the process of being fully understood by regulators (Peter, 2017).
    Blockchain technology has many attractions to the regulations since they are looking
    to improve the robustness of financial sector infrastructures. However, some questions
    exist about jurisdictional and legal issues (Guadamuz, 2015). A reactive behavior
    tends to be displayed by regulators, with no proactive guidance (Patrick, 2016).
    In 2014, regulators were of the view that new risks would be also observed with
    any new innovation; however, the cryptocurrencies and shared ledgers represent
    a cheap and efficient global payments infrastructure, the use of which should
    not be overregulated at this time (Patrick, 2016). Since blockchain technology
    will develop market infrastructure, regulators have begun considering potential
    benefits that could be realized with its adoption and, subsequently, could result
    in enhanced market infrastructure. Banking supervision is known as the other benefit
    consequent to the use of blockchain technology: if blockchain technology works
    as it is anticipated, regulators could move out stress test on the banks without
    having to rely on the banks to provide them with the data. The authorities concerned
    have passed this regulation after more than 70 potential risks of Bitcoin influencing
    users’ financial integrity and market participants were found by The European
    Commission (Perez, 2015). Regulations could influence the extent to which the
    technology could be developed. Consequently, there should be a need to balance
    against the stifling of innovation with the acknowledgement that it is unlikely
    the technology will deliberately contribute to systemic risks in this regard (Peter,
    2017). 4.2.3. Operational challenges Today, sustainable development, the effects
    of greenhouse gases and climate change are among the major issues facing society;
    and many organizations such as financial institutions are seriously looking to
    save money and reduce their carbon footprint (Cocco, Pinna, & Marchesi, 2017).
    However, the consensus mechanism in blockchain’s can be the reason for wasted
    resources, particularly electricity, in which nodes wanting to add new transactions/blocks
    constantly compete in a race to mine the next block for a high reward (Swan, 2015).
    In a practical study, Weber et al. (2017) found that uncles (forks of length 1)
    formed almost 10 % of announced new blocks on the Ethereum network. This phenomenon
    can be observed as inefficient, but it is also a small sign of the huge replication
    of effort in proof-of-work mechanisms (Mendling et al., 2018; Weber et al., 2017).
    Longer forks (as a maximum of length 3) were particularly occasional; hence, in
    a well-connected network, accidental forking seems questionable, however, it could
    take place if larger nations were cut off permanently or temporarily (Andersen
    & Bogusz, 2019). The proof-of-stake being a substitute to the proof-of-work has
    been discussed to a small degree (Yli-Huumo et al., 2016). Extremely low assumptions
    in trusting other participants are made by proof-of-work. There is a challenge
    to design more efficient protocols (for example, Proof-of-Stake), without compromising
    these suppositions (Yli-Huumo et al., 2016). Studies which focused on wasted resources
    were inadequate (Swan, 2015). Research conducted by Yli-Huumo et al. (2016) found
    that the wasted of resources and of computational power have been explored in
    Bitcoin mining. One of the key attributes in blockchain is computational power,
    which requires more consideration. With increasing complexity, more computational
    power is required by the blockchain. The Proof-of-Work concept is a rather new
    idea, which is the reason why it must be studied more to ensure that it can work
    in large-scale blockchain environments. The issue with wasted resources needs
    resolution so that mining in blockchain becomes more efficient. The scalability
    issue is the other challenge regarding the operational success of blockchains
    (Chanson, Bogner, Bilgeri, Fleisch, & Wortmann, 2019; Conoscenti et al., 2016;
    Yli-Huumo et al., 2016). As per the research, the increasing number of transactions
    and data stored permanently on every Bitcoin node are the cause of the scalability
    issue (Zheng et al., 2016). According to research conducted by Zyskind et al.
    (2015), increasing volumes of transactions cannot be scaled and handled by the
    blockchain. Therefore, they suggest that rather than handling the data by a single
    node, a small subset should be responsible for different groups of data. In other
    research conducted by Barber et al. (2012), they point out that scalability is
    an issue caused by the need for every node of the blockchain to verify each block.
    According to our assumptions, wasted resources would have remained a key area
    of concern in the overall research domain. There is a direct impact on all these
    issues and shortcomings as a result of an increase in the size of blockchain.
    Research in this area is ongoing and yet to gain maturity given the relative novelty
    of the technology. 4.2.4. Adoption challenges In the financial sector, the ability
    of different software applications and information technologybased systems to
    collaborate, share and use the information/data is referred to as interoperability
    (DeSalvo & Galvez, 2015). Existing companies will face challenges related to interoperability
    of blockchain platforms with their current internal systems. Externally, it remains
    to be seen how blockchain from multiple businesses might operate with each other
    (Lewis, McPartland, & Ranjan, 2017). Blockchain technology is a key area of concern
    for various companies, and authoritative standards should be employed to test
    security matters (Guo & Liang, 2016; Rossi et al., 2019). Lately, the International
    Organization for Standardization (IOS) received a request from Standards Australia
    to develop global standards for blockchain technology. For interbank applications,
    the R3 blockchain association aims to shape industry standards. A similar group
    called Interbank Market Technology Standards Workgroup was also established in
    China in August 2016. This working group is conducting prospective research on
    the market of blockchain technology between banks, regulations, and legal frameworks
    (Guo & Liang, 2016). Blockchain network designs are not standardized yet, and
    this can result in serious problems in implementation. Many different international
    and national organizations are attempting to create generally-accepted technical
    standards (Lewis et al., 2017). 4.3. Blockchain enabled financial sector functions
    More recently, international associations, including the United Nations (UN) and
    the International Monetary Fund (IMF), as well as developed countries such as
    the US, Britain and Japan, have paid close attention to the growth of blockchain
    and discerned various applications in different sectors (Guo & Liang, 2016). According
    to the claims by some researchers, blockchain have the potential to reshape the
    banking domain (Morini, 2016; Peters & Panayi, 2015). No central storage and permissions
    are needed for blockchain, resulting in major disruptions in the financial sector—particularly
    in payment clearing. Various global financial institutions have been framing ideas
    using blockchain technology since 2015 (Guo & Liang, 2016). Similarly, there has
    been widespread optimism regarding blockchain adoption in the banking sector.
    A survey conducted by McKinsey in May 2016 with global banking executives revealed
    that blockchain applications will have a considerable impact within 3 years and
    was underconsidered by half of the executives, and according to some researches,
    blockchain applications will have a considerable impact within 18 months (McKinsey,
    2016). As per the prediction of another survey of 200 global banks, almost 15
    % of banks intend to extensively implement blockchain technology. In addition,
    IBM was of the view that commercial blockchain would be owned by 66 % of the banks
    within 4 years (Fortune, 2017). Therefore, the following proposition is offered:
    Proposition 3 There is a necessity to fully understand the functionality of blockchain
    that relates to P2P transmission, data ownership, data sharing, data protection,
    and distributed innovations and its implications for research and practice in
    the financial sector. Fig. 11 sets out the distribution of blockchain enabled
    financial sector function articles in relation to point-to-point (P2P) transmission,
    data ownership, data sharing, data protection, and distributed innovations and
    shows that the highest number of current publications is within the domain of
    distributed innovations (13 articles). The lowest number of publications is within
    the domain of data sharing with only 5 articles. An in-depth discussion of findings
    associated with functionality of blockchain technology in the financial sector
    in relation to P2P transmission, data ownership, data sharing, data protection,
    and distributed innovations is provided next. Download : Download high-res image

    addressing blockchain enabled financial sector functions. 4.3.1. Point-to-point
    (P2P) transmission The processing by intermediary clearing firms is often required
    in interbank payments, which involves transaction reconciliation, bookkeeping,
    and payment initiation and balance reconciliation. Consequently, the process becomes
    costly and complicated. In terms of cross-border payments, where the clearing
    procedures are different for each country, it takes typically 3 days for a remittance
    to arrive. This is indicative of the huge volume of occupied funds and the low
    efficiency (China International Capital Corporation, 2016) and lack of alternative
    mechanisms. The blockchain technology can also implement the P2P payment, hence,
    the intermediary link is removed and will enhance service efficiency besides reducing
    the transaction costs (Lindman et al., 2017; Poon & Dryja, 2016; Xu et al., 2016;
    Zheng et al., 2016; Kenzevic, 2018). This will also enable banks to meet the requirements
    of fast and convenient payment clearing services for cross-border business activities
    (Abramova & Böhme, 2016). In addition, research conducted by Guo and Liang (2016)
    suggests that the payment clearing system can be an appropriate platform for blockchain
    application. Blockchain technology can be used to solve issues such as lack of
    mutual trust, high transaction cost and fraud. 4.3.2. Establishing data ownership
    A substantial amount of valuable data is generated on the Internet by every individual,
    which is extremely valuable as proof of the credit situation. However, large Internet
    companies tend to control this data. Therefore, individuals fail to establish
    ownership and control over their own data. Moreover, to protect user privacy,
    achieving data flow between these companies is challenging, which in turn results
    in the data islands. Blockchain technology is a potentially viable solution to
    these challenges by providing consistent and legitimate information (Davidson,
    De Filippi, & Potts, 2018; Lindman et al., 2017; Mattila, 2016; Zyskind et al.,
    2015). This can also ensure that the information is genuine and reliable (Zyskind
    et al., 2015), while minimizing the costs of data acquisition by credit agencies
    (Poon & Dryja, 2016; Xu et al., 2016). Using blockchain technology, big data can
    become credit resources with clear personal ownership, and even establish the
    foundation of future credit systems (Mattila, 2016). 4.3.3. Promoting data sharing
    The automatic recording of big data can be realized through blockchain (Tapscott
    & Tapscott, 2016). It also has the potential to store and share encrypted forms
    of the customer’s credit status within institutions (Mainelli & Smith, 2015; Zhao
    et al., 2016). Researchers have proposed the following blockchain credit solution:
    banks should store customer information in their own database during the “know
    your customer” process and, subsequently, encryption technology is employed to
    upload summary information to store the data in the blockchain (Price, 2017).
    Upon having query requests, a notification can be sent to the original data provider
    using the blockchain. Thus, external big data can be searched by all the parties
    with no exposure of their core business data (Rizzo, 2016). 4.3.4. Data protection
    Research on information privacy concerns is clearly of importance to IS researchers,
    and typically seeks to explain differences in levels of privacy concern or to
    explore the effects of privacy concerns on various dependent variables, such as
    the willingness to provide personal information or the willingness to transact
    online (Bélanger & Crossler, 2011). A research study conducted by Lazarovich (2015)
    developed an application that offers privacy protection and data protection. This
    platform has parallels with the Bitcoin’s blockchain (Zhao et al., 2016; Zheng
    et al., 2016). Owing to its decentralized nature, it can be used by real applications
    for different service providers. Research conducted by Zyskind et al. (2015) recommended
    a decentralized privacy system utilizing the blockchain for safety of personal
    data. The research uses blockchain as a database to make this kind of protection
    possible. The user inputs his/her data in the blockchain, and the companies seeking
    the required information can use it without storing the private information. At
    this point, the role of a third party is diminished, and users always receive
    the log history describing the use of their information (Seebacher & Schüritz,
    2017). The smart solution enables the user to manage his/her private information
    and stops the data from being accessed by unauthorized entities. Moreover, to
    safely distribute sensitive data in a decentralized manner, researchers have proposed
    a similar system based on blockchain technology (Zheng et al., 2016). 4.3.5. Distributed
    innovations in financial transactions Manual inspections and paper-based transactions
    are included in the finance supply chain (Guo & Liang, 2016). The presence of
    many mediators, high costs, high risk of illegal transactions and inefficiencies
    are characteristic of this process. Using smart contracts to modernize the conventional
    paperwork processes, manual interventions can be radically reduced by the blockchain
    technology (Pinna & Ruttenberg, 2016; Tapscott & Tapscott, 2017; Kenzevic, 2018).
    Consequently, efficiency of the finance supply-chain would be improved, and manual
    operational risks will be mitigated (Davidson et al., 2018; Walker et al., 2016).
    With the supplier, buyer and bank as the main business parties, the sharing of
    contractual information on a decentralized distributed ledger and smart contracts
    can ensure that payments are made automatically once a predetermined time and
    result is reached (Lindman et al., 2017). Generally, trade financing enterprises
    and banks can reduce expenditure by employing the functionality of blockchain
    technology in the finance sector (Block, Colombo, Cumming, & Vismara, 2018; Kenzevic,
    2018). According to calculations by McKinsey (2016), blockchain technology can
    enable banks to reduce operational costs by US $13.5–15 billion on a yearly basis
    while mitigating the cost of risk by US $1.1–1.6 billion annually. In addition,
    both trading parties will be able to reduce their cost of capital by US $1.1–1.3
    billion annually, and yearly operational costs by US $1.6 to 2.1 billion. In addition,
    a smoother flow of overall trade financing is ensured by the transaction efficiency
    boosting the income of the overall trade chain. Eventually, use of the blockchain
    could result in a new form of digital disruption and financial transformation
    (Böhme et al., 2015; Liebenau & Elaluf-Calderwood, 2016; Zyskind et al., 2015;
    Zhao et al., 2016). 5. Implications to theory, practice and future research We
    draw out several key implications from the findings of our systematic review for
    future research surrounding blockchain technology in the financial sector. 5.1.
    Implications to theory This paper strives to close the current research gap pertaining
    to potential implications of the blockchain for the financial services sector
    by presenting a framework built on three factors, namely benefits, challenges
    and functions. These were used to derive research questions that are theory-based
    as well as relevant for the industry. Based on this foundational information this
    paper initiated and stimulated an academic discussion on the potential impact
    of the blockchain and introduced a framework for theory development together with
    several research questions. The paper built on previous theories that are frequently
    used in technology research and showed how they can be adapted to blockchain-related
    questions. These theories can serve as a basis for developing future theories
    as the technology matures and modified accordingly. 5.2. Implications to research
    The key implications to research from our findings in this systematic literature
    review include issues related to blockchains that need further empirical study
    such as fast transaction, data sharing, wasted resources, scalability, and data
    protection. Current research in blockchain and, in particular as it relates to
    the financial sector, is concentrated in the area of associated services that
    make relevant information accessible in less time (fast transaction) (Guo & Liang,
    2016; Lindman et al., 2017; Zohar, 2015; Kenzevic, 2018). This has the potential
    to reduce transaction fees while expanding the scope and flexibility of IT services
    to the financial sector (Gao et al., 2015; Zhu & Zhou, 2016; Karafiloski & Mishev,
    2017; Li & Wang, 2017). Moreover, another huge incentive for the adoption of blockchain
    technology within the financial sector is data ownership (Davidson et al., 2018;
    Lindman et al., 2017; Xu et al., 2016; Zyskind et al., 2015). Using blockchain
    technology, big data can become credit resources with clear personal ownership,
    and even establish the foundation of future credit systems (Mattila, 2016). Data
    protection is clearly of importance to information systems researchers, and typically
    seeks to explain differences in levels of privacy concern (Lazarovich, 2015; Seebacher
    & Schüritz, 2017; Zhao et al., 2016). A research study conducted by Lazarovich
    (2015) developed an application that offers privacy protection and data protection.
    This platform has parallels with the Bitcoin’s blockchain (Zhao et al., 2016).
    Another research study conducted by Zheng et al. (2016) identifies a smart solution
    that enables the user to manage the private information and prevents the data
    from being accessed by unauthorized entities. Wasted resources and scalability
    are two of the most discussed operational challenges in blockchain, not just in
    the financial sector but across all other industries (Chanson et al., 2019; Lewis
    et al., 2017; Yli-Huumo et al., 2016). Research conducted by Yli-Huumo et al.
    (2016) found out that wasted resources and computational power have been the main
    drawbacks in Bitcoin mining. One of the key demands in blockchain processing is
    computational power, and its effective and efficient use requires further analysis
    and consideration. With increasing computation, more processing power is required
    by the blockchain. The Proof-of-Work consensus algorithm in the context of its
    use in blockchains is a relatively new innovation and requires further experimentation
    and refinement if it is to be made to work in large-scale blockchain environments.
    The issue with wasted resources needs to be solved in order to have more efficient
    mining in blockchain. The scalability issue is another operational challenge that
    can impact on the success of blockchain adoption. According to research conducted
    by Barber et al. (2012), scalability is an issue because of the need to verify
    each block by every node of the blockchain. These research considerations suggest
    some specific future research possibilities, and these are discussed next. 5.3.
    Future research directions As a research area, functionality of blockchain technology
    in the financial sector is an emerging topic. Although the research on the use
    of blockchain technology in the financial sector is growing, this is the first
    attempt towards a synthesis of the existing research findings based on a systematic
    review. According to our review strategy, only 87 articles have been selected
    in our study, among which the significant number of publications occur in 2014–2017
    and fewer publications occur in 2011–2013 (see Fig. 5). The overall theme of the
    publications in 2014–2017 represented realization of benefits and challenges with
    specific blockchain functionality in the financial sector. There is a lack of
    theoretical orientation and longitudinal study of the overall value of blockchain
    to the financial sector, demonstrating the lack of maturity in this research area.
    Nevertheless, a positive finding is the uniform distribution of research articles
    that are published in IS and business journals (see Fig. 6). An analysis of the
    research topics according to the classification framework as illustrated in Fig.
    8 showcases the expanding research interest in the area of benefits presented
    by blockchain technology in the financial sector. However, there is a reduced
    interest in studies surrounding blockchain functionality in financial applications.
    This might imply that the key technological and management issues have been addressed
    as the blockchain technology has evolved. Therefore, studies associated with the
    benefits from using blockchain technology might seek more generic benefits rather
    than specific blockchain functions. This is a promising development that provides
    a positive roadmap for future research work. This systematic review paper has
    attempted to offer an overview of some significant key dynamics with blockchain
    technology that can be of interest to social and finance consultants. This technology
    is still in its early stages, but it is apparent that there are possibly empowering
    uses of it in certain contexts. A good starting point to explore blockchain would
    be to build new research into the following: • The benefits and challenges for
    the blockchain system’s use from a financial technology and systems perspective.
    This includes its use within a payment system and banking facility. This can be
    completed with studies on the extent to which blockchain-based property title
    systems have the potential to open up normal bank financing to people who cannot
    access credit from financial organizations. • Blockchain technology applications,
    in particular for the financial sector, are still in their infancy. There is a
    call for researchers to investigate and develop more prototypes to deepen the
    understanding of the technology in relation to its application in the financial
    sector. There are many frameworks, concepts and models, such as those suggested
    by Mamoshina et al. (2017), and these need to be tested and implemented to evaluate
    their strengths and weaknesses. • There is a need for open standards to guarantee
    interoperability between different blockchain products. To date, the main aim
    has been to focus on the functionality of blockchain prototypes for proof of concepts.
    However, the open standards for interoperability need to be defined for the adoption
    and implementation of the blockchain in the financial sector. It is necessary,
    at this stage in the life of the technology, for researchers to start looking
    into interoperability issues and the process of standardization. • The challenges
    of interoperability, scalability, data security, data privacy and speed that characterize
    blockchain financial applications are all open research issues that require further
    investigation to increase stakeholders’ confidence in the use of this type of
    technology, and to foster its adoption for the financial sector in particular.
    In fact, to implement trust-free sharing services in the financial sector, it
    is necessary to consider security aspects (such as confidentiality, availability,
    and integrity) which represent one of the principal characteristics of blockchain-based
    technology. This is because a blockchain is a decentralized protocol where all
    information is confidential and the availability of data does not rely on any
    third parties. Moreover, integrity is ensured since this technology can be regarded
    as a distributed file system where participants keep copies of files and agree
    to changes by consensus. • There is the potential for blockchain technology to
    create an infrastructure to implement ‘new social contracts for sustainability’,
    contributing to the promotion of the transition to sustainable development. Blockchain
    system provides a foundation for the transactions of the data that does not require
    any centralized function and that supports links among the clients for resolving
    issues (Faber & Hadders, 2016). As a result of that, blockchain overcomes the
    current business model, which is principally managed by old mainstream bureaucratic
    structures and organizations that include political loyalties, banks and local
    governments. Consequence, if blockchain-based solutions are to be used by an increasingly
    larger number of people and the volume of transactions increases exponentially,
    more research on wasted resources needs to be conducted to ensure scalability
    and sustainability. • In general, there is very limited research related to supply
    chain finance (Caniato, Gelsomino, Perego, & Ronchi, 2016; Wang, Han, & Beynon-Davies,
    2019; Carter, Rogers, & Choi, 2014). In particular, there is no reliable research
    which can describe the relationship between blockchain technology and supply chain
    finance. As such, blockchain diffusion into supply chain systems provides fertile
    ground for future research. Examining this emerging phenomenon would offer valuable
    insights as to how blockchain supports financial collaboration across supply chain
    stages—and not only bilateral financial settlements. More importantly, it will
    allow us to interrogate the economic value of the blockchain and see whether it
    affects the profitability of the business. Based on our findings, there remains
    many avenues for researchers to explore, particularly technology-related research
    related to scalability and interoperability, and sociotechnical research related
    to the development and implications of the blockchain for individuals, organizations
    and society. While much of the research currently focuses on technical improvements,
    models, architectures and use cases, implications of the technology on society
    and changes likely to be brought about by the many proposed use cases to current
    business models need to be examined as well. 5.4. Implications to practice This
    research offers the following key implications to practice in order to enable
    increasing adoption and use of blockchain-based financial solutions. For financial
    organizations to adopt and use blockchain technology throughout the financial
    sector it is necessary to collaborate together through the blockchain consortium
    (Sankar et al., 2017; Yeoh, 2017). With a view to the decentralization of the
    current financial system, it is very likely that it will take a long time for
    blockchain to be adopted and used throughout the banking industry because changes
    in financial systems and transformation of the system of financial organizations
    must be generally delivered in parallel. In the case of interbank payment, the
    move to introduce a closed distributed ledger that does not go through the central
    bank is accelerating. In international financial transactions, the closed distributed
    ledger service, including banks and customers, is evolving in the international
    payment service. Blockchain technology, based on the origins of the distributed
    ledger introduced by Bitcoin, is already evolving as a new flow of finance. As
    the introduction of distributed ledgers focused on financial organizations is
    widespread, closed distributed ledger technology is predicted to be a pioneer
    in the future innovation of finance in terms of reliability, stability and efficiency
    (Yeoh, 2017). As technology evolves, the needs of consumer and related environments
    change. At the same time, there is an increasing opportunity for individuals to
    be compromised by information such as hacking, and there is a strong need for
    blockchain technology because of the efforts of organizations that are trying
    to defend against hacking. To promote market movements, the government and related
    organizations should recognize and support the power of blockchain in individual
    and business transactions, public services, etc., through the development of original
    technologies and expanding knowledge regarding best practices. 6. Research limitation
    There are two major research limitations associated with this paper. Firstly,
    the fundamental operating principle of a blockchain was introduced about a decade
    ago. The initial interest in the early blockchain was largely limited to the computer
    science area, to which the blockchain represented a new arrangement of long-term,
    pre-existing computer science theory (i.e. hashing, linked lists of data, and
    public key cryptography). Some several years passed before other industry and
    academic communities were sparked to consider the blockchain concept. Since then,
    much interest has been generated, but research topics are still considered scattered
    and research approaches are still maturing and many lack rigor (Trieblmaier, 2019).
    It is also widely accepted that the emergence of blockchain publications in leading
    academic journals has shown a substantial time lag in comparison to industry adoption
    (Trieblmaier, 2019). In overall terms, there is a real lack of research studies
    in relation to blockchain in general, and in particular to the financial sector
    – and this produces a significant limitation to a systematic literature review.
    Secondly, the Research Methodology of this paper describes that a systemic review
    of the available literature has been conducted. Through a systemic review, the
    research is able to ascertain, assess, understand, and produce the available research,
    and reach logical conclusions based on the findings of the review (Dikert et al.,
    2016; Victor, 2008). Within this systemic review approach, this paper has adapted
    the three phase protocol (planning, execution, reporting) of Tranfield et al.
    (2003), Kitchenham and Charters (2007). This systemic review approach certainly
    delivers the fundamental goal of a literature review that adds value to a discipline/sector
    discussion, rather than only providing an overviews of individual papers. Our
    adapted approach, however, does have a limitation in that the publishing journals
    of reviews papers were not classified. The addition of this information would
    add depth to the value contributed by the systemic review. 7. Conclusion The extant
    literature focusing on blockchain technology has been checked, reviewed and discussed.
    A number of articles were chosen from the online database and classified into
    several different areas. This systematic review paper offers an understanding
    of the current blockchain research and its practical implementation and implications
    for the financial sector. The blockchain technology is predicted to play a significant
    role in the future directions of the financial sector. Firstly, users would be
    able to better manage their transactions and data in many areas. Execution of
    transactions would be ensured in all respects without the involvement of a third
    party. The financial sector would thus be able to determine the smart solutions
    for managing their data according to their needs on a P2P network. Blockchain
    technology could revolutionize the surrounding ecosystem of financial tools. It
    can more effective and efficiently contribute to user authentication, automatic
    encryption on data and recording data access histories. However, a number of challenges
    still persist, for instance, standards, scalability, interoperability, security
    incidents, and wasted resources. In addition, blockchain applications offer solutions
    for the complete replacement of existing systems. Therefore, the transition will
    not be rapid or straightforward. However, blockchain development is still in the
    early stages and these obstacles will eventually be overcome, thus opening the
    way for many exciting possibilities. Declaration of Competing Interest None. Appendix

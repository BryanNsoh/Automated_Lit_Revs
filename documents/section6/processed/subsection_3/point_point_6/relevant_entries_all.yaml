    of Things to the Internet of Food: The EU Epistemology of “Ethically-Related Science”
    Coined by Kevin Ashton, the British technology pioneer and cofounder of Auto-ID
    Center at MIT, the term “Internet of Things” (IoT) (Ashton 2009) is nowadays definitely
    a reality, where the physical (like furniture and appliances) and the virtual
    (software applications and databases) words converge in the creation of a plethora
    of smart objects and devices wirelessly connected to the web. This internet-like
    structure allows the user to remotely control wearable computing, quantified-self
    technology and smart homes, going beyond machine-to-machine communications, thus
    generating efficiency, accuracy and economic benefits for society (ITU 2013).
    Yet the capacity the IoT possesses to augment the reality through an inextricable
    mixture of hardware, software and services is increasingly becoming the engine
    for a revolutionary rethinking of data and information gathering and sharing (EC
    2016a). Categorized into data-carrying, data-capturing, sensing and actuating
    devices, the IoT ecosystem includes characteristics spanning from interconnectivity
    to heterogeneity to things-related services, so as to create a new class of cyber-physical
    systems capable of both affecting every aspect of individual and social human
    life (ITU 2013) and of completely reshaping each field of application (Peppet
    2014). The European Commission (EC)’s Digitisation (2016b) and Standardisation
    Communications (2016c) highlight the importance of Europe in becoming a leading
    region in IoT products and applications, so thus “improving the way we collectively
    and individually function, upgrading our slow, obsolete and ‘un-smart’ life sustaining
    processes through technoscientific innovation” (Benessia and Pereira 2015, 80).
    Inevitably, in this prospect of stability and control, the transformative fusion
    of the physical world with ICT technology raises myriad concerns at the policy
    level, ranging from semantic interoperability and standardization activities to
    data protection and liability issues (EC 2016a). In the face of these aspects,
    ethics turns out to be the joining link between the institutional approach to
    tackle them and the role played by the citizenry along the on-going process of
    ‘social digitalization.’ ICT ethics is increasingly being istitutionalised, becoming
    a sort of “indicator of normativity,” namely a policy flexible tool similar to
    a soft law instrument in establishing unenforceable, voluntary conduct, while
    simultaneously making the governance of the IoT more legitimate—ethically and
    democratically (IERC 2015, 23 ss.). In the late 1980s, indeed, during Europe’s
    transition from an economic to a political entity and in the context of the rise
    of biotechnology, the EU ‘regulatory law,’ that is legal regulation instrumental
    of particular economic or social policy ends, shifted to ‘ethics’ to create the
    idea of the EU citizenry (Tallacchini 2009). Through the establishment, in 1991,
    of the Group of Advisers on the Ethical Implications of Biotechnology (GAEIB)—replaced
    in 1997 by The European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies (EGE)—the
    Commission’s intention was to detect and define the ethical aspects concerning
    genetic manipulation, in addition to assessing its impact on society, as well
    as to ensure that citizens were adequately informed. The establishment of an ethical
    committee, whose activity was qualified as ‘expert advice,’ was a clear attempt
    to include an indirect public commitment in the framework of the EU policy procedures,
    in order to contribute to and achieve a fruitful development of biotechnological
    products within the market (CEC 1991, 16). Nonetheless, the institutionalization
    of ethics aimed at integrating science, innovation and social interests to increase
    the role of civil society in the political EU, turned out to be problematic. Despite
    the implementation of cultural, ethical and social values in decision-making processes,
    the Committees have imposed themselves on the community—instead of opening up
    a civic dialogue—through a top-down approach which has pervaded and legitimized
    scientific knowledge, in the name of that moral integrity always recognized to
    scientists from the beginning of modern age. Citizens’ role has been relegated
    to that of mere recipients of EU ethics, ‘adequately informed,’ though without
    any active involvement in the choice of values to implement in public decisions
    (Tallacchini 2009, 2015). Today, in the face of the current EU strategies fostering
    ICT technology, the EU epistemology of “ethically-related science” (Tallacchini
    2015) has been acquiring new peculiar contours. Especially in innovative fields—such
    as the IoT—ethics has been unveiling a specific meaning, by coping with a commitment
    towards human agency and for the integration between technical and human dimensions
    (IERC 2015, 23 ss). This contribution deals with the ethical challenges arising
    from the IoT landscape with reference to a specific context, i.e. the realm of
    agri-food. In this sector, innumerable web-connected tools, platforms and sensors
    are constantly interacting with consumers/users/citizens, by reshaping and redefining
    the core elements and functions of machine-human being relationships. By highlighting
    the panoply of opportunities and purposes presented by the rise of the so-called
    Internet of Food (IoF), this paper outlines how the loci of ethics are constantly
    and profoundly being rethought, distributed and extended along every step of the
    food chain, so as to provide food actors with new roles and empowering tools,
    together with unexplored forms of responsibilities. By sketching out the main
    pillars which ethics of IoF is founded on, my argument posits that the civic hybridization
    of knowledge production mediated by IoT technologies may create breeding ground
    for the move towards an ‘ethical in-design’ approach to the IoF-driven smart systems.
    Namely, information flows coming from and surrounding cyberspace might strongly
    contribute to building miscellaneous digital spaces of public engagement in relation
    to food issues, where consumers/users/citizens become endowed with the right to
    explore and ‘build’ ethics of the emerging IoT, in pursuit of values and norms
    debated, shared and accepted in more transparent and democratic ways. The Internet
    of Food Architecture: Outlook and Concerns In the ever-changing and ever-evolving
    realm of agri-food, the inter-networking of smart things is gradually giving birth
    to a peculiar and fascinating scenario, i.e. the Internet of Food (IoF hereby).
    Though a general accepted definition of the latter does not exist yet, given its
    infancy and the difficulty of defining something that continually and rapidly
    changes and transforms, the IoF concept usually refers to a sophisticated vision
    of the food sector brimming with communicating sensors and digital services and
    devices through which to empower citizens’ food choices and habits (Frey et al.
    2016). It is a highly sensorised world in which a spectrum of all-knowing things
    and value-added services are being used to “enable all known information about
    every food ingredient and product to be accessed by machines, consumers, and companies”
    (Elgan 2016). This promising frontier in food technology has been attracting the
    interest of food players due to its potential to entirely rethink the relationship
    among institutions, industries and the citizenship. Ranging from precision agriculture
    to agri-food logistics to “food awareness” (Lehmann et al. 2012), the IoF landscape
    is likely to “define the lingua franca enabling both agriculture and food to be
    more traceable, transparent and trustworthy” (Trice 2016), by drawing aid from
    machine learning and artificial intelligence. In the flourishing digital farming
    sector, in particular, IoT technologies (such as cloud computing, drones, sensors,
    global positioning systems) allow users to collect weather data, map crop yields,
    track seed varieties, analyze nutrient applications and, at the same time, share
    all captured data and interpret them with big-data techniques (EU-SCAR 2016; EPRS-STOA
    2016). In this vein, internet connectivity represents the virtual nexus through
    which to create added-value integrated services spanning from pest identification
    systems to ‘smart aquaponics’ gardens, from alert systems to sensors tracking
    dairy cows, helping farmers spot illnesses earlier (Chen et al. 2014). As for
    the monitoring of the food chain, examples encompass pervasive low-cost technology
    for the scrutiny of power usage, 3D printing of pasta, chocolate or cakes, sensor-enhanced
    hardware and connected smartphone apps to automate much of the brewing process,
    handheld spectrometers scanning every sort of food product (Frey et al. 2016).
    This innovative ICT-based picture is being more and more enriched by initiatives
    of “food awareness,” aimed at indexing all pre-made food products in a comprehensive
    genomic database (so as to provide a precise molecular view of food), at applying
    genomics and analytics techniques to mitigate food borne illness and other risks
    in food management, as well as at using DNA testing to optimize individual diets
    and give lifestyle advice (Elgan 2016). With this scenario in mind, the process
    is intuitive as at the baseline of this large-scale food ambient stands a cascade
    of bits and bytes combined and integrated with each other to give more accurate
    and precise food information, together with the goal of enhancing and guaranteeing
    food safety within the realms of processing and manufacturing. However, the heterogeneity
    of data coming from the ever-expanding IoT enabled objects is posing novel intricate
    dilemmas to deal with, classifiable into three major categories: the technical
    problems pertaining to the legibility of the data, the economic aspects related
    to companies’ market competitiveness and information power, and the legal issues
    arising from data usage and data ownership. The first question pertains to the
    ability of reading the data in the formats they are presented in. The importance
    of this aspect is inherent to both the data’s value and its potential for improving
    products and services and/or creating new ones. Therefore there is a need for
    both technical standards that are easily understandable and applicable, as well
    as rules, guidelines and best practices that can address—according to reliability
    and transparency—the techniques of algorithms processing, data mining, data fusion
    and information integration. To this end, semantic frameworks containing machine-readable
    annotations (ontology) about food have been studied (Boulos et al. 2015) to design
    information platforms capable of offering intelligent, personalised and context-sensitive
    dietary recommendations, as well as appropriate levels of traceability and transparency.
    As regards the economic subject, profiling and targeting are becoming more and
    more the corner stones of the modalities through which companies learn about and
    measure every aspect of citizen’s lives. Gathering and combining data about, for
    instance, calories burned or food bought online, allow industry to gain real-time
    and hyper-personal insights into individual consumers’ preferences and behaviors,
    so as to target them individually and specifically (Helberger 2016). The deriving
    image of the “profiled consumer” clearly explains companies’ interests in maintaining
    their informational power for the purposes of both marketing strategies and detention
    of competitive power on the market (Eskens 2016). Such information asymmetries,
    however, and their consequences in terms of economic advantages are likely to
    trigger dangerous forms of social control (Mantelero 2012), inevitably conflicting
    with the divergent citizens’ requests for freely accessible, machine-readable
    and re-usable data (food-related data included). This matter, moreover, goes hand
    in hand with the third issue mentioned above, that is privacy and data protection
    concerns, affecting every aspect of the agri-food sector. In the farm sector,
    characterised by numerous SMEs combined with a limited number of conglomerates
    like Monsanto and DuPont, farmers’ concerns firstly deal with both the access
    from government officials to private information without explicit permission,
    and the secondary and tertiary uses of the data. Further fears concern the confidentiality
    underpinning some farm information, as well as the possible misuse of the data
    related to particular farming techniques as akin to trade secrets (Ellixson and
    Griffin 2016). With reference to collecting food safety data, Chaves and Kerschbaum
    (2008) have highlighted producers’ worries about their industrial privacy when
    using Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) attached to items, due to the possible
    use of the information on the RFID tag by competitors to gain insight into the
    supply chain. Besides, as far as genetic information usage is concerned, the problem
    lies in processing sensitive data collected through databases and smart devices
    equipped to interact with other smart items and users, but also traders and third
    parties (insurance companies, governments, advertisers, among others). All these
    examples clearly mirror the challenges faced by the networked system architecture
    of the IoF, so as to call for an ethical approach—together with well defined legal
    rules—able to combine technoscientific innovation with citizens’ right to food
    information, meant both as a ‘normative tool’ for transparency and access to information,
    and as an inalienable and participatory right to using, controlling and sharing
    their own data. At the international level, the Mauritius Declaration on the IoT
    adopted in October 2014 made transparency the key concept which privacy policies
    addressing the IoT ecosystem and its derived big data should be based on. With
    more information being produced, shared and repurposed than ever before, “those
    who offer internet of things devices”—it affirms—“should be clear about what data
    they collect, for what purposes and how long this data is retained,” by eliminating
    the out-of context surprises for customers. How can this vision be implemented
    in the current EU food policy agenda? Governing the Web-Connected Agri-Food Sector
    Through Ethics and Food Law Given the specific characteristics of the IoT, such
    as ubiquity, smartness and connectedness, the EU has adopted a proactive approach
    to the IoT vision since 2009, looking at the concepts of trust, acceptance and
    security as the driving force to make the IoT system an “Internet of Things for
    people” (CEC 2009). The following year, after the European Parliament’s Resolution
    calling on the Commission to set up, inter alia, a panel of experts to propose
    an ethical framework for the development of IoT applications (EP 2010, point 14),
    a multi-stakeholder expert working group (IoT-EG) was formed to advise the EC
    on the core issues related to the emerging IoT. In the framework of its last work
    carried out in 2012, the IoT-EG discussed six key ethical issues (social justice,
    trust, the blurring of contexts, non-neutrality of IoT metaphors, agency and autonomy)
    to describe the connection of ICT technology to moral and social issues. This
    analysis led to a number of policy objectives aimed at steering the IoT development
    in the desired direction. Among them, the Group suggested: a fair access to IoT
    technology and the qualification of citizens to make use of it; the protection
    of personal data, ensured privacy and usable security management; the option to
    make the otherwise invisible IoT technology visible for inspection purposes. Besides,
    because of the analogies and metaphors through which the IoT is being embedded
    in living spaces, the Group stressed the need that the actions being taken by
    IoT technology are actually intended by its users, and that profiling algorithms
    are morally proper and subject to continuous monitoring and assessment procedures
    (IoT-EG 2012). Certainly, this analysis has put forward a great many ethical challenges
    to investigate in depth, though intricate to face. From a legal stance, the recent
    adoption of Regulation No 2016/679 (the General Data Protection Regulation or
    GDPR) has taken a big step in the current EU legislative framework on data protection
    to meet the above mentioned recommendations. Having embedded provisions spanning
    from profiling to the right to be forgotten, from data protection by design and
    by default to the right to data portability, from security to the data protection
    officer, the new GDPR represents a detailed legal elaboration of Article 8 of
    the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU on personal data protection (the Charter
    2012). Yet this special protection recognized by Regulation to the citizen-user
    symbolizes the will to reaffirm the worth of individuals within the automated
    digital processes. With reference to the food sector, moreover, further legal
    rules can be added to this picture. Since ICT became an instrument in European
    hands through which to build an information society for all (EC 2002), in order
    to make information technologies as widespread as possible, in the food sector
    the goal coincided with the will to protect human health, by guaranteeing the
    safety of food products placed in the market. With the adoption of General Food
    Law (Regulation No 178/2002), indeed, food information has been deemed more by
    its capacity to guarantee food safety than to allow consumers to take informed
    choices in the market (Leone 2014). In General Food Law—whose aim is to provide
    “the basis for the assurance of a high level of protection of human health and
    consumers’ interest in relation to food” (Article 1)—the citizen appears as the
    consumer to be protected against health risks. Consequently, information, rather
    than working as medium of economic transactions (Articles 8 and 16), constitutes
    mostly one of the tools helping to determine whether any food is unsafe (Article
    14). Presently, with the advent of the new Regulation on labelling No 1169/2011,
    the EU legislator has given general attention to food information and communication,
    with the objective of contributing significantly to the health and well-being
    of citizens (and to their social and economic interests), whilst ensuring the
    smooth functioning of the internal market. On the one hand, Recital 23 empowers
    “the Commission to enable certain particulars to be made available through alternative
    means,” so as to enlarge the right of consumers to food information. On the other
    hand, Article 2 para. 2 lett. a) expands the notion of “food information,” by
    going beyond labeling and “including modern technology tools,” thus drawing upon
    ICT means and devices to take advantage of their full power of knowledge. In this
    way, food players have been allowed to build new food products and services closer
    to their interests and goals, and have been empowered at the same time by protecting
    their own rights and expectations. What seems to be lacking, however, is the attribution
    to citizens of an active role in embedding their own values and needs in ‘artifacts,’
    thus to entrusting and enabling them with degrees of power and control over technology
    itself. Yet the last recommendation given by the IoT-EG (2012) shed light on the
    necessity to make the ethical debate on the IoT experienced by the European citizenry,
    without confining it merely to corporate initiatives. Though the EGE has emphasized
    the application of participatory models solely to political participation (EGE
    2012, 63), the need to balance—with regard to the ethical aspects of the IoT—top-down
    Internet governance by governmental agencies with bottom-up participatory approaches
    by the Internet community has been stressed by the RAND Europe, a nonprofit institution
    which the EC contracted with to help improve the EU policy on the IoT. Having
    investigated ethical tensions arising from the newness brought about by the IoT—especially
    in relation to privacy, autonomy, trust, identity and social inclusion—the Corporation
    has proposed improving social inclusion by removing barriers to participation
    (RAND 2013, 80). In this sense, it has recommended a soft law approach to boost
    broad-based participation and competition capable of balancing potentially divergent
    objectives. “Helpful in this respect”—the RAND alleged—“would be a ‘sandbox’ initiative
    in which commercial, public sector and civil society stakeholders could ‘play’
    with different arrangements in an environment that is (by design) trusted, secure
    and capable of capturing innovations” (Ibidem, 127). Moreover, it advocated an
    ethical charter to both safeguard consumers’ interests in IoT environments and
    offer guidance to developers of IoT services (Ibidem, 128). Tackling this matter
    of concerns has thus strengthened the pre-existing idea to integrate normativity
    into information and communication solutions (EDPS 2010; EC 2012; EGE 2012; WP29
    2014; IERC 2015), so as to embrace a sort of “by-design approach” (Cavoukian 2012)
    to automatically protect individual rights and security. Generally speaking, by-design
    normativity consists of mechanisms embedded within the design and architecture
    of IT systems and business practices, from the very early design stage, right
    through to their ultimate deployment, use and ultimate disposal. It follows that
    ethics and law by-design can be understood as privileged forms of protection,
    namely specific normative orientations and regulatory principles in themselves,
    aimed at reducing individual users’ burden in dealing with ICT technology (Pereira
    and Tallacchini 2014, 14). However, as privacy is a complex concept dealing not
    only with different aspects of human personality, but also with a multiplicity
    of individual, collective and cultural sensibilities—even more evident in the
    agri-food domain—the perspective of replacing norms and rules with technology
    needs to face ethical and pragmatic considerations. Given the numerous practical
    problems concerning the use of the informed consent (Barocas and Nissenbaum 2009)—though
    its legal relevance is expressly recognised by Article 8 (2) of the Charter—the
    proper functioning of data protection tools cannot be separated from establishing
    and implementing certain related rights, and enabling people to use them. As said
    before, rather than ‘nudging’ Internet users towards reaching established ends,
    the vast arena of public and private actors (including authorities, policymakers,
    industry, civil society organizations, users and communities) should interact
    with and intervene in ICT orientation, in order to define the relevant values
    and rights to embed in the IoT infrastructure. To this end, a last significant
    question for our analysis comes out: how to engage the EU citizenry in building
    the IoF environment as a more knowledgeable and participatory fabric of connections
    between humans and smart things? The Challenging Move Towards an ‘In-Design Ethical
    Approach’ to the IoF With regard to the adoption of plausible remedies designed
    to cope with and overcome the ethical dilemmas deriving from ICT, Mortier et al.
    (2016) have identified in the three concepts of “legibility, agency and negotiability”
    the key elements that should structure any discussion concerning human-data interaction
    (HDI). By referring to transparency, control and the socio-legal framework of
    data and analytics algorithms respectively, the concepts included in the HID agenda
    have been put forth to open up a constructive dialogue among parties in ICT ecosystems.
    With this vision in mind, the concept of “ethical design” (Baldini et al. 2016)
    appears effectively suitable, from an engineering point of view, for extending,
    deepening, and strengthening the HID vision. This peculiar form of ethics prompts
    users to process digital architectures as collaborative design, in an attempt
    to open up civic spaces for reflection and decision with respect to certain regulatory
    choices to entrust to citizens. In this new ‘epistemic and engineering model,’
    “values are neither imposed nor pre-identified,” since “they are proposed and
    framed as an individual right of choice in the ICT architecture” (Ibidem). Ethical
    design, indeed, does not only affect the level and modalities of protection of
    private life and data, but extends to the possibility of guaranteeing individuals’
    access to their own raw data stored on the web, of providing pledges of visibility
    and transparency on information processes, as well as of interoperability between
    systems and devices (for example in the field of wearable sensors for the measurement
    of biological and physiological functions). To design an ethical blueprint for
    the IoF architecture, we intend to echo the concept of “ethical design” and coalesce
    it with the framework proposed, at the normative level, by Richards and King (2014)
    as regards the paradigm of big data. The authors have suggested the development
    of a “big data ethics” as a set of four principles (privacy, confidentiality,
    transparency and identity) called to govern data flows in our information society,
    and inform the establishment of big data norms. Following and mixing these two
    lines of reasoning, we propose an ‘ethical in-design approach’ to the IoF (Fig.
    1), meant as form of educational and social learning of the contexts and modalities
    in which the IoF architecture is constructed and framed. With the intention of
    balancing human values with the potential uses of large amounts of data, the proposed
    ethical framework of norms and rights focuses on the pillars of privacy, transparency,
    education, negotiability, agency and responsibility designed to protectively govern
    data flows in the agri-food sphere, as well as to safeguard the freedom of individual
    and collective food habits and choices, while enabling citizens to exercise their
    legitimate rights. Fig. 1 The Internet of Food ethics in-design Full size image
    Privacy as a ‘Context-Driven Right’ Our surely imperfect but hopeful ethical perspective
    leads us, firstly, to reshape the concept of privacy, understood no more as mere
    protective tool designed and controlled elsewhere by third subjects, but—borrowing
    Helen Nissenbaum’s work (2015)—as ‘context-driven right.’ This means taking privacy
    to be the requirement that personal information is compliant with informational
    norms, which prescribe that information flows according to key actors (i.e. recipients,
    information subjects and senders), types of information and constraints surrounding
    it. In the precision farming context, for example, informational norms govern
    flows between and about individuals in their context-specific capacities, such
    as farmers, agricultural retailers, farm consultants, machinery manufacturers,
    software producers and so forth. Farm information encompasses a cornucopia of
    different types of data, such as agronomic, financial, metrological, machine and
    staff data. And among concerns, protecting the ownership of farm data currently
    constitutes a prominent constraint on the terms of the contractual arrangements
    (COPA-COGECA 2016). This is because the IoF omnipresence blurs the boundaries
    between the public and private sphere, by sending the data collected, registered
    and shared through the IoT network anyway, thus affecting reliability of both
    the data and the devices involved in their processing (AIOTI 2015, 25). Opening
    Agri-Food Related Data for Transparent and More Trusted Relations The pillar of
    ‘transparency’ calls for the development of more trustworthy relations between
    food actors and smart things, based on openness and awareness towards data flows
    and data usage. To this end, it is worth mentioning the significant steps taken
    so far by so-called “open data movement,” phenomenon strictly linked to the ICT
    revolution and aimed at making data freely accessible, re-usable and modifiable
    by anyone for any purpose. Though the EC framed Open Data in terms of data-driven
    economy, through which to pursue business and economic opportunities, as well
    as to create new products and services (EC 2011), Open Data is likely to play
    a crucial role in unleashing new modalities of food-related knowledge production
    (GODAN 2015). In this regard, the Open Food Facts database, together with the
    activities and initiatives undertaken by EuroFIR AISBL, Lichfield District Council
    and Nesta, represent well-developed examples of citizens-led and technology-based
    projects, which reflect the tendency towards making citizens aware of, and exert,
    their own rights, by enhancing and strengthening access to food information—and
    consumer protection, as a consequence (Leone 2015). Educational Measures to ‘Negotiate’
    Knowledge Embracing and building the IoF ethics in-design into policy and law-making
    will require, thirdly, novel advanced educational measures, aimed at building
    collective transdisciplinary knowledge of the relationships between technology
    and normativity, as well as to overcome the huge social problem of the digital
    and knowledge divide. And it would allow for discussion and control over all the
    normative choices implicitly black-boxed and hidden in IoF applications and devices,
    so as to guarantee flexibility and adaptive capacity in ‘negotiating’ the development,
    production and sharing of socially robust food-related knowledge. For instance,
    the Committee of Professional Agricultural Organisations (COPA) and the General
    Confederation of Agricultural Cooperatives (COGECA) have expressed their own views
    on the principles that should underpin the collection, use and exchange of agricultural
    data. By calling for both the recognition of the farmers’ right to benefit from
    and be compensated for the use of farm data, and the need to grant the farmer
    a leading role in controlling the access to and use of data from his/her farm,
    the two associations have made transparency, simplicity and trust the main elements
    to ensure within the contracts on agricultural technologies (COPA-COGECA 2016).
    Citizens Acting as Creative and Empowered Subjects As a penultimate column of
    our ethical approach, the concept of ‘agency’ alludes to the capacity for human
    beings to act as subjects instead of deterministic mechanisms (Arendt 1958). It
    acquires an ethical dimension “when the intentionality of delegated actions is
    not fully controllable by the user, does not identify with the user’s identity
    and compromises his/her integrity, autonomy and eventually his/her freedom” (Pereira
    et al. 2013, 42–43). In this sense, a full concept of humanness arises, calling
    for the urge to let human agents behave intentionally and responsibly. Benessia
    and Pereira (2015) have represented the dream of the IoT as the deus ex machina
    consisting of a spectrum of machines, sensors and computing devices able to express
    what we—meaning us and our machines—want, can and need to pursue through it. Tackling
    paradoxes and human costs arising from these narratives of IoT enhancement implies
    the need to prevent human agents from behaving merely as “actants” (IERC 2015,
    30), namely as “passive users” (Benessia and Pereira 2015, 88) relying on implicit
    values and “hostages of technology” (EC 2016a, 27) being monitored by structured
    binary information, in lieu thereof of intentional subject acting responsibly
    and conceiving helpful and creative knowledge. Here, we refer to ‘agency’ as an
    umbrella term including the concepts of virtual identity, autonomy and self-reflexivity,
    so as to undermine the ICT technology’s digital architectures and to trigger forms
    of cooperation and collaboration in which integrity, consciousness and intentionality
    are preferred and preserved by impoverishment (IERC 2015, 29). The rethinking
    of normative practices related to technical innovation along this line of reasoning
    would give rise to significant spaces for reflection and decision-making at the
    intersection between knowledge and normativity, capable of going beyond the delegation
    of human autonomy to IoF applications. Responsibility as Both “RRI” and “Culture
    of Accountability” The last founding stone for building an IoF ethics in-design
    rests on the robust concept of ‘responsibility.’ While the EC is at work to enhance
    legal certainty with regard to liability (contractual and extra-contractual) in
    the IoT context (EC 2016a, 2017), here we link the term ‘responsibility’ to both
    the “Responsible Research and Innovation” (Von Schomberg and Davies 2010) credo
    and the issues pertaining to the Nissenbaum’s analysis on accountability. In today’s
    “Innovation Union,” that is the flagship initiative promoted by the EU institutions
    to address technoscientific innovation (EC 2010), responsibility has been rethought
    and construed in terms of co-responsibility of individuals in relation to emerging
    technologies (nano and synbio, in particular). From here, the expression ‘responsible
    innovation’ is widely used to spur—within research activities—interactive and
    transparent processes in which social actors and innovators are mutually responsible,
    taking into account ethical acceptability, sustainability and public desirability
    of innovation processes and their market products, in order to implement and foster
    technoscientific progress. This multifaceted framework might be applied to promote
    IoF infrastructures to enable food players and end-users to gain a clear understanding
    of their actions’ outcomes, evaluate them in terms of their social needs and moral
    values (justice, autonomy, security, sustainability, democracy and efficiency),
    and use these hints for the promotion of responsible research within the web-connected
    agri-food domain. As for the “culture of accountability,” the reference is to
    the need to create a particular kind of organizational context, in which answerability
    works to entice people to pay greater attention to system safety, reliability
    and sound design (Nissenbaum 1997). Applied to the realm of food, this vision
    would entail, first defining corporations’, stakeholders’ and citizens’ values
    and needs and, then, comprehending how these values can be morally discussed and
    debated, so as to assign and take up normative decisions and actions complying
    with them. Examples range from offering suitable mechanisms that put a fair level
    of data control back in the hands of users/citizens, to clarifying the reasons
    why and the ways through which food and farm data are being collected, stored
    and used. Thus conceived, this ethical framework may contribute to revitalising
    and reinvigorating the food-related ICT-led interactions among companies, consumers/citizens
    and IoT technology suppliers, by both making normativity inscribed in artifacts
    explicit and transparent and opening rooms of debate and deliberation that include
    citizens’ knowledge and engagement before and during the design phase. Some Conclusive
    Thoughts Since the IoF gained momentum in the agri-food domain, ICT-mediated objects
    have been nurturing pervasive and ubiquitous initiatives of knowledge production
    and data sharing. The vast realm of IoF systems, platforms and sensors are about
    to drastically rethink and reshape the agri-food sector as a whole in miscellaneous
    ways: by keeping constant tabs on the condition and quality of produced, transported
    and stored food products; by monitoring production conditions, shipping time and
    temperature; by capturing and managing every stage of the food chain delivery
    process (AIOTI 2015; Andrews 2015). Perceptions and perspectives on this revolution
    are so promising that scholarly work (SMART ACTION 2015, 17) has highlighted that
    the IoF applications might represent a valid means in pursuit of some of the Millennium
    Development Goals—established following the Millennium Summit of the United Nations
    in 2000—especially in reaching more sustainable food production and agricultural
    systems. In this overall framework, what is at stake with ICT technology—as with
    any complex technological revolution—is the consequence the IoT may have on society
    at large. Within the wide food policy context which IoF devices are embedded in,
    the need to achieve the right mix of security and flexibility calls for IoF developments
    to be regulated and trusted, which inevitably entails a thorough scrutiny of moral
    values and ethical issues. In facing potentially disruptive IoT-led ramifications,
    normative debates (WP29 2014, 3) have endorsed the necessity to keep citizens
    free, safe and well informed, in order to support trust and success of products
    and services on the market. Translated to the area of agri-food, these requests
    ask that clear rules on data usage and data ownership be defined so as to favour
    adoption of IoF solutions in smart farming and food value chain. Along this way
    from labs to markets, however, the sole reference to the need of both making citizens
    well informed about their data and adopting data protection rules may reduce normative
    issues to mere technical aspects, as such to be solved in terms of feasibility
    and economic efficiency, risk mitigation and public acceptance (Benessia and Funtowicz
    2016, 106). The democratic and participatory hallmark inherent to our proposed
    ethical approach to the IoF aims, instead, to deconstruct the ‘environments’ where
    innovation originates and develops, by screening and scrutinizing the values that
    permeate and define them. In this sense, ‘IoF ethics in-design’ might give word
    to all food actors involved in the value chain, by combining the individual dimension
    with the collective one, the protection of each subject with the active exercise
    of his/her rights, everyone’s own knowledge with the general interests belonging
    to the community. In his recent (2017) open letter marking the 28th anniversary
    of the worldwide web, Timothy Berners-Lee stressed three pernicious trends to
    urgently tackle in order to release digital knowledge’s potential arising from
    the net: lost control of personal data, spread of misinformation on the web, and
    political advertising used in ‘unethical ways.’ In looking at algorithmic transparency,
    the adoption of a set of common principles to be followed, and a tighter regulation
    of online political advertising as possible solutions to be considered and implemented,
    he has placed his trust in knowledge and creativity unleashing by everyone’s contribution
    and engagement. In the wake of these hopes and desires for the web’s future, the
    inclusion of ethical attributes in IoF ‘enchanted objects’ may feed the roots
    to give participatory rights a normative status, while enhancing and strengthening
    the digital relations between ICT innovation and the EU ‘food citizenry.’ References

    sensing 1. Introduction Agriculture production systems have benefited from incorporation
    of technological advances primarily developed for other industries. The industrial
    age brought mechanization and synthesized fertilizers to agriculture. The technology
    age offered genetic engineering and automation. The information age brings the
    potential for integrating the technological advances into precision agriculture
    (PA) (Whelan et al., 1997). The factual base of PA-the spatial and temporal variability
    of soil and crop factors within a field—has been appreciated for centuries. Before
    the completion of agricultural mechanization, the very small size of fields allowed
    farmers to vary treatments manually. However, with the enlargement of fields and
    intensive mechanization, it has become increasingly more difficult to take account
    of within-field variability without a revolutionary development in technologies
    (Stafford, 2000). PA is conceptualized by a system approach to re-organize the
    total system of agriculture towards a low-input, high-efficiency, sustainable
    agriculture (Shibusawa, 1998). This new approach mainly benefits from the emergence
    and convergence of several technologies, including the Global Positioning System
    (GPS), geographic information system (GIS), miniaturized computer components,
    automatic control, in-field and remote sensing, mobile computing, advanced information
    processing, and telecommunications (Gibbons, 2000). Agricultural industry is now
    capable of gathering more comprehensive data on production variability in both
    space and time. The desire to respond to such variability on a fine-scale has
    become the goal of PA (Whelan et al., 1997). After more than 10 years of development,
    PA has reached a crossroad with much of the necessary technology available but
    with the environmental and economic benefits yet unproven (Stafford, 2000). Many
    technological innovations have been presented but development of agronomic and
    ecological principles for optimized recommendations for inputs at the localized
    level is generally lagging. Many farmers are uncertain as to whether to adopt
    available PA technologies on their farms. Motivations for widespread uptake of
    PA technologies may come from strict environment legislation, public concern over
    excessive use of agro-chemicals, and economic gain from reduced agricultural inputs
    and improved farm management efficiency. After all, success of PA technologies
    will have to be measured by economic and environmental gains. 2. Spatial and temporal
    variability Variabilities that have significant influences on agricultural production
    can be categorized into six groups. 2.1. Yield variability Historical and present
    yield distributions. 2.2. Field variability Field topography—elevation, slope,
    aspect, and terrace; proximity to field boundary and streams, etc. 2.3. Soil variability
    Soil fertility—N, P, K, Ca, Mg, C, Fe, Mn, Zn, and Cu; soil fertility as provided
    by manure; soil physical properties-texture, density, mechanical strength, moisture
    content, and electric conductivity; soil chemical properties—pH, organic matter,
    salinity, and CEC; soil plant-available water-holding capacity and hydraulic conductivity;
    and soil depth. 2.4. Crop variability Crop density; crop height; crop nutrient
    stress for N, P, K, Ca, Mg, C, Fe, Mn, Zn, and Cu; crop water stress; crop biophysical
    properties—leaf-area index (LAI), intercepted photosynthetically active radiation,
    and biomass; crop leaf chlorophyll content; and crop grain quality. 2.5. Variability
    in anomalous factors Weed infestation; insect infestation; nematode infestation;
    disease infestation; wind damage, and hay damage. 2.6. Management variability
    Tillage practice; crop hybrid; crop seeding rate; crop rotation; fertilizer application;
    pesticide application; and irrigation pattern. Among these variability types,
    yield variability is often considered the ultimate dependent variable, whereas
    most other variability types are treated as independent variables. The most extensively
    studied independent variable to date has been soil nitrogen fertility level. In
    fact, most variable-rate technologies (VRT) for chemical applications have been
    developed on nitrogen-fertilizer applicators. Many types of variability are both
    spatial and temporal in nature. Weed infestation serves as an example. Spatial
    weed-patch patterns may change during the crop-growing season. Variabilities in
    climate parameters are mostly temporal in nature. However, intensive precipitation
    monitoring across fields is also important to assisting decision making for fertilizer
    applications (O''Neal et al., 2000). 3. Managing variability Managing the variability
    can be achieved by two approaches: the map-based approach and the sensor-based
    approach. With available technologies of GPS, remote sensing, yield monitoring,
    and soil sampling, the map-based approach is generally easier to implement. This
    approach requires the following procedure: grid sampling a field, performing laboratory
    analyzes of soil samples, generating a site-specific map, and, finally, using
    this map to control a variable-rate applicator. A positioning system, such as
    a GPS, is usually required for this approach. The sensor-based approach, on the
    other hand, measures the desired properties, such as soil and plant properties,
    using real-time sensors in an ‘on-the-go’ fashion and controls variable-rate applicator
    based on the measurements. For the sensor-based approach, a positioning device
    is not always needed. Most experimental precision-agriculture systems are map-based
    systems, because most on-the-go sensors for monitoring the field, soil, and field
    variability are too expensive, not sufficiently accurate, or not available. Spatial
    databases have been generated using various GIS systems by integrating maps derived
    from remote sensing, soil sampling, yield monitoring, and various sensors. Advanced
    geo-statistical methods are used to analyze the spatial and temporal variability
    (Pena-Yewtukhiw et al., 2000). Crop-modeling techniques have been incorporated
    to develop yield potential maps as a base for fertilizer prescription (Werner
    et al., 2000). These maps can be used to predict variability in crop growth and
    crop disease based on projected climatic conditions. Thus, PA provides an ideal
    tool for agricultural risk assessment and rational farm-work scheduling. 4. Management
    zone Site-specific applications of agricultural inputs can be implemented by dividing
    a field into smaller management zones that are more homogeneous in properties
    of interest than the field as a whole. A management zone is defined as ‘a portion
    of a field that expresses a homogeneous combination of yield-limiting factors
    for which a single rate of a specific crop input is appropriate’ (Doerge, 1998).
    Thus, management zones within a field may be different for different inputs, and
    delineation of management zones for a specific input involves only the factors
    directly influencing the effectiveness of that input in achieving certain goals.
    A management zone also can be delineated by more than one specific crop inputs.
    In this case, a single rate is applied for each of the specific inputs within
    a zone. The number of distinct management zones within a field is a function of
    the natural variability within the field, the size of the field, and certain management
    factors. The minimum size of a zone is limited by the ability of the farmer to
    differentially manage regions within a field. If a GPS is involved to control
    the application or to guide the implement, there seems no reason for restrictions
    on the shape of the zone. However, in reality, the pattern in which the application
    equipment traverses the field should be considered when delineating the management
    zones (Kvien and Pocknee, 2000). The concept of management zone may be perceived
    as a setback from the early PA concept of ‘farming by foot’. However, management
    zones are more practical to implement. Delineating management zones involves spatial
    filtering to reduce effects of noise in measurements of individual factors. Removal
    of excessive details in within-field variability simplifies the shapes of the
    zones and, thus, reduces the requirements for VRT equipment. Chang et al. (2000)
    compared different approaches to classify nutrient management zones. Zhang and
    Taylor (2000) introduced methods of delineating management zones using morphological-
    and spatial-filtering tools. 5. Impact of precision agriculture The impact of
    PA technologies on agricultural production is expected in two areas: profitability
    for the producers and ecological and environmental benefits to the public. 5.1.
    Profitability PA allows precise tracking and tuning of farm production. PA technologies
    provide farmers with opportunities of changing the distribution and timing of
    fertilizers and other agrochemicals based on spatial and temporal variability
    in a field. Farmers can make economic analyzes based on the variability of crop
    yield in a field to obtain accurate assessment of risk. For example, a farmer
    could verify that, for 70% of the time, 75% of the barley grown in a field would
    yield 3.8 tones. By knowing the cost of inputs, farmers can also calculate the
    cash return over the costs for each hectare. Certain parts within a field, which
    always produce below the breakeven line, can be isolated for the development of
    a site-specific management plan (Goddard, 1997). The economic benefits resulting
    from PA, however, have proven difficult to measure (Lowenberg-DeBoer, 1996). Griffin
    et al. (2000) compared VRT with uniform-rate technology (URT) for phosphorus application
    on a rice and soybean rotation in Arkansas and found that the profitability of
    VRT was highly sensitive to both residual P and soil clay content. Even when VRT
    was found profitable on silt loam fields, switching from URT to VRT during a 10
    year planning horizon may be unadvisable, as increased revenue from yields does
    not cover the cost for VRT implementation. If a whole-farm approach, which takes
    all cropping activities and resource limitations into account, is adapted, PA
    technologies may prove to be beneficial for improving profit potential and for
    reducing the risks (Oriade and Popp, 2000). 5.2. Environment Strict environmental
    legislations have been present in countries like USA, Australia, UK, Denmark,
    and Germany. In the near future, European Union directives may well be established
    that will force farmers in member countries to significantly reduce usage of agro-chemicals.
    PA provides the means of precise and targeted application, recording of all field
    treatments at the meter scale, tracking from operation to operation, and transfer
    of recorded information with the harvested products. (Stafford, 2000), all of
    which would assist in enforcement of the legislations. Although the environmental
    benefits of PA have not been systematically and quantitatively measured (Lowenberg-DeBoer,
    1996), some researches have revealed positive evidences. Nitrate leaching has
    been a major problem in potato cropping systems, especially in coarse-textured
    soils. A study conducted in two adjacent fields, one treated with URT for nitrogen
    fertilizer and the other with VRT, has demonstrated the effect of VRT in reducing
    the ground water contamination (Whitley et al., 2000). With the availability of
    topographic data for fields implemented with PA technologies, the interaction
    between tillage and soil/water erosion can be examined and, thus, reduction in
    erosion can be achieved (Schumacher et al., 2000). 6. Engineering innovations
    While agronomists are playing the leading role in PA development, engineers have
    worked diligently to provide technologies needed to implement PA practices. Engineering
    innovations for PA involve development of sensors, controls, and remote-sensing
    technologies. 6.1. Sensors Robust, low-cost, and, preferably, real-time sensing
    systems are needed for implementing various PA technologies. Commercial products
    have become available for some sensor types. Others are currently under development.
    6.1.1. Yield sensors Grain yields are measured using four types of yield sensors-impact
    or mass flow sensors, weight-based sensors, optical yield sensors, and γ-ray sensors.
    Most major agricultural equipment companies provide optional yield-mapping systems
    for their combine harvesters. Yield sensing techniques for major crops are approaching
    maturity. For forage crops, yield monitors using a displacement sensor, a load
    cell, a capacitance-controlled oscillator, and an optical sensor have been studied.
    An optical sensor measuring spectral radiance in the red and NIR wavebands was
    used to estimate yield during cropping seasons and to guide VRT for nitrogen fertilizer
    (Solie et al., 2000). A simple, low cost, and automatic yield mapping system was
    developed to generate yield maps of hand-harvested crops (Schueller et al., 1999).
    A continuous mass-flow type yield sensing system, equipped with load cells and
    a vibration-resistant angle transducer along with a DGPS, was developed to collect
    spatially variable yield data for tomato in real-time (Pelletier and Upadhyaya,
    1999) 6.1.2. Field sensors Commercial sensors receiving and processing GPS signals
    have become affordable for most farmers in developed countries. Handheld GPS receivers
    provide positioning accuracy within±100 m. Differential GPS (DGPS) reduces the
    error to±2m. A relative positioning GPS brings the error down to the sub-centimeter
    level. This accuracy can be maintained for moving vehicles using a real-time kinematic
    (RTK) GPS. Dux et al. (1999) used a geo-referenced audio recorder with a speech-recognition
    capability to generate field maps during field scouting. This system allows users
    to record visual observations on crop growth, weeds, diseases, or other anomalies
    while walking or riding an ATV within a field. Yule et al. (1999) developed a
    data acquisition system to monitor in-field performance of an agricultural tractor.
    Performance parameters mapped during field operations were used to analyze field
    variabilities of topology, soil type, and soil moisture content, and to identify
    areas in field needing remedial actions. 6.1.3. Soil sensors A near infrared (NIR)
    soil sensor measured soil spectral reflectance within the waveband of 1600–2600
    nm to predict soil organic matter and moisture contents of surface and subsurface
    soils (Hummel et al., 2001). An on-line, real-time soil spectrophotometer measures
    soil spectral reflectance in the visible and NIR wavebands at a ground speed of
    3.6 km/h. Field tests demonstrated linear relationships between reflectance at
    certain wavelengths and various soil properties, including soil organic matter
    and moisture content (Shibusawa et al., 2000). A soil electrical-conductivity
    (EC) sensor based on a four-electrode method has proven effective in detecting
    several yield-limiting factors in non-saline soils (Lund et al., 2000). In France,
    an eight-rolling-electrode sensor was developed to measure soil EC at three depths
    (Dabas et al., 2000). Combining a soil EC probe with an automated penetrometer,
    soil subsurface can be mapped (Drummond et al., 2000). A soil EC sensor using
    the electromagnetic-induction method is a non-contact sensor. EC measured using
    this sensor correlated well with a soil productivity index, which combines effects
    of bulk density, water-holding capacity, salt, and pH (Myers et al., 2000). EC
    measured before planting can be related to plant-available-water-holding capacity
    (Morgan et al., 2000). A penetrometer equipped with a near-infrared reflectance
    sensor measured soil penetration resistance as well as moisture content and organic
    matter (Newman and Hummel, 1999). A penetrometer combined with a soil EC sensor
    can be used to measure soil hardpan (Clark et al., 2000). Soil moisture-content
    sensors were designed under different physical principles, including time-domain
    reflectivity (TDR), standing-wave ratio (Sun et al., 1999), and depolarization
    of a laser light (Zhang et al., 2000a). A ground-penetrating radar was used to
    produce a contour map to indicate clay lenses, which govern the magnitude and
    direction of ground-water movement (Dulaney et al., 2000). 6.1.4. Crop sensors
    Thai et al. (1999) used a field spectral-imaging system with a liquid crystal
    tunable filter in peanut and cotton fields. A near-ground scanning radiometer
    mounted on a tractor mapped vegetative-indices (Stafford and Bolam, 1998). Sudduth
    et al. (2000) designed an electromechanical sensor to count corn plants. Cotton
    plant height was measured using mechanical fingers and infrared light beams (Searcy
    and Beck, 2000). Grain protein and oil content sensors are currently under development.
    A cotton mass-flow and strength sensor was developed using a halogen lamp and
    an NIR light (Keskin et al., 1999). An infrared thermometer was used to measure
    canopy temperature to control irrigation events (Evans et al., 2000). A capacitance
    sensor, a sensor measuring power required at the PTO shaft, a microwave sensor,
    and a NIR sensor were tested to measure moisture content of forage (Marcotte et
    al., 1999). An on-line, real-time spectrophotometer developed by Anom et al. (2000)
    was used to map plant water, nutrient, disease, and salinity stresses. It was
    projected that development in gene manipulation of crop plants may further enable
    differentiation between these stress types (Stafford, 2000). Michels et al. (2000)
    designed an infrared plant-temperature transducer to sense plant temperature changes
    caused by water stress. Ahmad et al. (1999) used a chlorophyll meter coupled with
    a DGPS to map nitrogen stress in corn. A multispectral radiometer was employed
    to detect crop salinity stress. Rial and Han (1999) studied the performance of
    a commercial complex permittivity sensor in measuring ionic nutrients. 6.1.5.
    Anomaly sensors Several weed sensors are commercially available. Tian et al. (1999)
    developed an intelligent sensing and spraying system to identify weed-infested
    zones with a high accuracy. Feyaerts et al. (1998) designed a weed sensor using
    an imaging spectrograph. Wang et al. (2001) developed an optical weed sensor based
    on a study on spectral characteristics of weeds, crops, and soil. An infrared
    plant-temperature transducer developed by Michels et al. (2000) was used to sense
    plant temperature changes caused by greenbug infestation. 6.2. Controls 6.2.1.
    VRT agro-chemical applicators Many manufacturers are now producing controllers,
    sprayers, air spreader, anhydrous ammonia systems, and herbicide applicators for
    VRT applications. Bennett and Brown (1999) developed a direct nozzle injection
    system for herbicide application. Swisher et al. (1999) designed an optical sensor
    to measure flow rates of granular fertilizer in air streams for feedback control
    of a variable-rate spreader. 6.2.2. Automatic guidance systems An automatic guidance
    system can position a moving vehicle within 30 cm or less using high-precision
    DGPS. It may replace conventional equipment markers for spraying or seeding and
    may serve as a valuable field-scouting tool (Goddard, 1997). 6.2.3. Robotic harvesting
    systems Japanese researchers proposed an advanced, automatic follow-up vehicle
    system and an autonomous vehicle for multiple farm operations (Iida et al., 1998).
    Harvesting robots for tomato, cherry tomato, cucumber, strawberry, grape, and
    watermelon were already commercialized. It is predicted that more robotic harvesting
    systems will be commercialized in early 21st Century (Umeda et al., 1999). 6.2.4.
    Networked systems A distributed control system using controlled area network (CAN)
    communication between individual sensors and actuators, a supervising controller,
    and a navigation system was designed and installed to control spray droplet size
    and application rate for agricultural chemicals (Stone et al., 1999). 6.3. Remote
    sensing Remote sensing techniques have seen limited use in PA due to the need
    for high spatial resolution images. According to recent literature, remotely sensed
    images have been used to predict nitrogen need in corn (Scharf and Lory, 2000),
    to estimate cotton lint yield (Li et al., 2000, Hendrickson and Han, 2000), to
    assess insect damage in wheat (Riedell et al., 2000), to detect spider mite in
    cotton (Fitzgerald et al., 2000), to assist in insecticide application (Seal et
    al., 2000), to estimate clay concentration of surface soil (Chen et al., 2000),
    to detect weeds (Varner et al., 2000), to quantify hail or wind damage in crops
    (Erickson et al., 2000), or to detect and classify anomalies (unusual phenomena)
    (Carter and Johannsen, 2000). Satellite remote sensing has held out much promise
    for within-field monitoring but has yet to demonstrate hard evidence for complete
    success. Problems include timeliness, cloud cover, cost, poor spatial resolution,
    and lack of processing to produce image data of use to the crop managers. Hyperspectral
    sensing is a relatively new technology that is capable of providing information
    over a nearly continuous spectrum in the visible, NIR, and MIR wavebands. Images
    acquired from hyperspectral sensors have been used for estimation of crop vigor
    and yield prediction; discrimination between crops, weeds, residue, and soil;
    and quantitative measurements of crop water content and leaf area index. Measurement
    in the MIR band also has potential for providing information on plant nutrient
    and soil properties (Deguise and McNairn, 2000). 7. Information management After
    more than a decade of research and practice, PA has accumulated a huge amount
    of data and is now facing a serious problem of ‘data overflow’. For the spatial/temporal
    information that has been collected, there is an urgent need for tools specifically
    designed for data storage, processing, management, and analysis. There is also
    a strong need for data-exchange standardization. 7.1. Field-level GIS General-purpose
    GIS packages, such as arcview, idrisi, and surfer, provide many functions, some
    of which offer little value to PA applications. Most of these packages are expensive
    and require computer platforms that are not usually possessed by farmers. To address
    the urgent need for PA applications at the field level, many commercial GIS packages,
    such as the software packages introduced by AGRIS Corporation, Farm Works™, Agri-Logic,
    Inc., John Deere Precision Farming Group, Case Corporation, Rockwell International,
    and RDI Technologies, Inc., have been developed (Ess et al., 1997). Some systems
    directly interact with DGPS devices or yield sensors to acquire location and yield
    data in real time. Runquist et al. (2001) developed a field-level GIS (FIS) containing
    analytical functions for spatial data analysis in PA research. 7.2. Data interchange
    standardization PA technologies are information-based technologies. As the amount
    of data generated from both mobile and static sources increases, a need for standardized
    data communication and standardized file and data trasfer has been recognized.
    Great efforts have been made to establish an international standard (ISO 11783)
    for communication protocols on mobile, agricultural and forestry machines using
    CANs to provide exchangeability between sensor and actuator products provided
    by different manufacturers and to allow modular design of new products. File and
    data formats have been standardized in ISO 11787 (referred to as ‘ADIS’—agricultural
    data interchange standard) and are in use by some manufacturers. With these standards,
    information can be exchanged smoothly and efficiently between sensors, processors,
    controllers, and software packages produced by different manufacturers (Stafford,
    2000). 8. Worldwide applications PA research started in the US, Canada, Australia,
    and Western Europe in mid-to-late 1980s. Although a considerable research effort
    has been expended, it is still only a portion of farmers who have practiced any
    type of PA technologies. Implementation of PA has mainly been through utilization
    of existing field machinery by adding controllers and GPS to enable spatially-variable
    applications. To date, the leading application of PA still is the site-specific
    application of fertilizers. In Australia, monitoring and mapping the spatial variability
    in small-grain crop yields have received much publicity. Crop-yield monitors are
    available for potato, peanut, and forage harvesters and, still under development,
    for cotton harvesters to monitor both quantitative and qualitative parameters.
    The total number of grain yield monitors operating in Australia is below 200 at
    present, comparing to USA, which has between 5000 and 10 000 operating units (half
    with DGPS capability). The movement towards PA in Australia is considered not
    strong (Whelan et al., 1997). In Japan, the Ministry of Agriculture has started
    to invest in PA research projects, focusing on sensing and controls related to
    agricultural mechanization. Japan is characterized by a small-scale and labor-intensive
    agriculture based on individual plant management. Japanese agriculture has faced
    many serious problems during the past two decades, including rice-production surplus,
    rapid reduction in agricultural workforce, shift in farmers’ age group, and growing
    environmental concerns. Japanese agriculture is diverse in field size, crop variety,
    field elevation, water management scheme, climate, soil, and the like. It was
    believed that PA technologies can fit into different farm scales only after a
    reorganization of the agricultural structure (Shibusawa, 1998). Despite the fact
    that most PA experiments were concentrated on VRT applications of fertilizers
    and herbicides, diverse types of PA technologies have been experimented throughout
    the world. Reports on PA experiments in China, Korea, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Sri
    Lanka, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Australia, Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Russia,
    Italy, The Netherlands, Germany, France, UK, United States, and Canada have been
    found in recent literatures.VRT application of lime has been proven successful
    in the southeast region of the US (Heiniger and Meijer, 2000). VRT also was tested
    on corn hybrids and seeding rates in Colorado (Shanahan et al., 2000). Bauer et
    al. (2000) conducted field tests in Missouri to determine optimum planting densities
    in different fields. A similar experiment conducted in Kansas showed no economic
    benefit by varying planting rate (Zhang et al., 1999). In California, potentials
    of PA technologies in rice production are being evaluated through an intensive
    study (Roel et al., 2000). Also in California, an experiment was conducted to
    study the feasibility of PA technologies in tomato production (Rosa et al., 2000).
    In Costa Rica, an experiment was conducted to apply PA technologies in a banana
    plantation. The system allows farmers to link to a soil database and to make site-specific
    decisions on soil fertility- and disease-related problems through yield monitoring.
    A cable system was used to replace expensive DGPS (Stoorvogel and Orlich, 2000).
    Johnson and Bradow (2000) studied the effects of a number of soil properties,
    including soil Mn, Mg, and K, on cotton fiber quality in Louisiana and believed
    that PA technologies may be applied to improve the quality. Gimenez and Lamothe
    (2000) conducted a field experiment in Uruguay to assess the benefit of site-specific
    Zn management and concluded that profit obtained by VRT of Zn application may
    reach $50 per hectare. PA also was used to optimize irrigation operations. In
    South Carolina, plant water stress was monitored using infrared thermometers on
    a center-pivot irrigation system to control the system operation (Evans et al.,
    2000). In Arizona, Adamsen et al. (2000) studied surface irrigation systems and
    found that water application is inherently non-uniform in these systems because
    of the spatial and temporal variability of soil infiltration characteristics.
    Thus, adjusting the irrigation system''s physical design or developing management
    practices specific to individual fields may prove to be beneficial to the farmers.
    McKinion et al. (2001) applied a PA approach to cotton production in Mississippi
    to automate the calculation of optimum water and N rates. They believed that PA
    coupled with crop simulation models and GIS can optimize yields while minimizing
    water and nitrogen inputs. Site-specific pest control has been tested in different
    crops. In the UK, potential for varying nematicide-rate in potato fields was studied
    by Stafford and Evans (2000). Site-specific control of northern corn rootworms
    was studied in South Dakota (Ellsbury et al., 2000). McLaughlin and Burtt (2000)
    used draft sensors on a three-point hitch of a tractor to record draft data and
    made a tillage-energy map in Ontario, Canada. Such maps may provide an additional,
    inexpensive map layer for soil-related information for PA applications. Draft
    force on a mouldboard plow was recorded by Hayhoe et al. (2000). They applied
    Fourier analysis on the periodical draft signals and found that lower frequency
    components of the signals may be related to local spatial variability in soil
    physical properties, such as soil moisture, soil texture, organic matter, and
    soil strength/compaction. In Wisconsin, Schuler and Lowery (2000) used a TDR sensor
    in subsoiler shanks to measure soil moisture content while subsoiling. The signal
    was used to control the subsoiler operating depth to match varying soil conditions.
    PA technologies were experimented in hay and forage production in Quebec, Canada
    (Marcotte et al., 1999). Sensors that continuously measure the weights in the
    baler and the trailing wagon and sensors that simultaneously measure mass flow
    and moisture content were tested. Successful development of these sensors may
    enable several PA applications, including cultivar selection, optimization of
    hay or silage additives, yield mapping, and forage crop management. PA technologies
    also have been used in forest production. In Washington, GPS receivers and dataloggers
    were used to track activities of log harvesting machines (Reutebuch et al., 1999).
    9. Adoption trend In 1998, a nationwide survey was conducted by USDA over nearly
    8500 agricultural producers in the US. According to the survey results, it was
    estimated that, by 1998, only four percent of all farms used one or more PA technologies
    for crop production. However, there is a significant variation in adoption rates
    by specific technology, region, farm size, farm type, and operator characteristics.
    The most widely adopted technologies were grid sampling (2% of all farms) and
    VRT for fertilizer (2%), followed by yield monitoring (1%) and yield mapping (1%).
    Variable-rate seed and pesticide application and remote sensing technologies were
    used only on less than 1% of all farms. Farm size, measured in terms of gross
    sales, was positively correlated with adoption rate. Grain/oilseed farms were
    found to have the highest rate of adoption (14%) primarily because of the widespread
    availability of yield monitors. Adoption rate for specialized fruit, vegetable,
    and nut farms is 5%. The main PA technology used in these farms was VRT for pesticide
    control (Daberkow and McBride, 2000). Cook et al. (2000) found that farmers in
    Australia are adopting PA technologies more slowly than expected. They attribute
    the slow adoption to four factors: (1) cost of adoption, (2) lack of perceived
    benefit from adoption, (3) unwillingness to be early adopters, and (4) lack of
    technology delivery mechanism. Although the cost, lack of perceived benefit, and
    conservatism among farmers have indeed caused the slowness in adoption, the problem
    in delivering the PA technologies to farmers has been identified as the major
    obstacle. Delivering PA technologies to farmers requires knowledge and skills
    that most consulting agencies currently do not possess. The conservatism of the
    consultancy sector seemed to create more difficulties than the conservatism of
    farmers in adopting PA technologies. In the UK, a survey was conducted among 25%
    of about 350 farmers who are currently conducting yield mapping using GPS. Results
    of the survey showed that the adopters of yield mapping have passed the first
    stage of initial uptake and enthusiasm and are now standing at the second stage
    of PA implementation. Farmers adopting yield mapping are in urgent needs for good
    advices from agronomists on interpreting yield maps and converting them into management
    plans. Yield mapping information needs to be integrated with farm decision-support
    systems (Griffin, 2000). A similar survey conducted in Arkansas indicated that
    early PA adopters represent less than 20 percent of Arkansas farmers. These adopters
    are young, educated, computer using, experienced farmers with large amounts of
    acreage predominantly devoted to rice and soybeans. While agricultural industry
    representatives are helping promote PA technologies, Cooperative Extension Service
    personnel have served as the main source for technical consultation. Farmers are
    waiting for research results on profitability of various PA technologies before
    increasing their investment significantly to adopt more technologies (Popp and
    Griffin, 2000). The following barriers need to be overcome before PA technologies
    can be widely implemented in a fast pace: 1 Data overflow for farm management.
    This problem has to be overcome by developing data integration tools, expert systems,
    and decision support systems. 2 Lack of rational procedures and strategies for
    determining application requirements on a localized basis and a parallel lack
    of scientifically validated evidence for the benefits claimed for the PA concept.
    3 Labor-intensive and costly data collection. Development of rapid sensing systems
    must take place before PA can be widely practiced. 4 Lack of technology-transfer
    channels and personnel. Educational programs involving researchers, industry,
    extension specialists, and consultants are urgently needed. PA technology will
    likely gain more recognition when additional benefits, such as reduced environmental
    burdens and increased information flow, are recognized as a part of its rewards
    (Auernhammer, 2001). 10. New trends in PA research The following new trends in
    PA research have been observed from recent literature: 10.1. Integrated approaches
    Most researchers have used the map and sensor approaches separately to address
    individual PA problems. However, a group of scientists in Germany are making an
    effort to integrate these two approaches for VRT application of nitrogen fertilizer.
    This requires development of reference values of crop-specific nitrogen requirement,
    on-line sensing of nitrogen and water conditions in plant and in soil, integration
    of remotely-sensed data, real-time data acquisition and transmission, and establishment
    of data base for universal use of site-specific fertilization and economic/ecological
    evaluations (Auernhammer et al., 1999). Because mixed and, sometimes, conflicting
    results and opinions regarding the use of PA technologies exist, a more aggressive
    team approach to determine the economics and viability of current and future PA
    strategies is needed. Johnson et al. (2000) initiated a field research project
    in Minnesota, involving a partnership between university research and extension
    specialists, farmers, and agribusiness sectors to analyze the economic and biological
    impact and to assess risks related to different PA strategies. 10.2. Forward-looking
    approaches Dynamic characteristics of farm operations require a forward-looking
    approach to respond to fertilizer, pesticide, and water needs proactively in portions
    of a field. A research project conducted in the Netherlands used sensors, simulation
    models, and real-time weather data to keep track of actual conditions in field.
    Warning signals were generated once deficiency was detected. Crop production could
    thus be maximized without exceeding chemical application limitations imposed by
    environment legislation (Van Alphen et al., 2000). 10.3. Internet-based information
    network In Germany, an effort is made to develop an Internet-based communication
    and information network for all aspects of the agribusiness, including farms,
    cooperatives, farming companies, contractors, dealers, and suppliers, in order
    to develop an integral management strategy for the entire agribusiness, enabling
    more farmers to participate in and benefit from PA technologies (Lutticken, 2000).
    11. Potential applications in China Technological progress in PA has attracted
    attention of Chinese agricultural engineers since mid-1990s (Wang, 1998). Entering
    the information-based economy era, the time lag of developing countries in adopting
    new technologies has greatly reduced (Wang, 1999b). It has been predicted that
    adoption of PA technologies in China will take the following path (Wang, 1999a):
    1 Deliver modernized, information- and knowledge-based, agricultural-management
    system concept to farmers through PA experiments to gradually convert existing
    empiric-based farming practices to information-based, modern agriculture. 2 Practice
    PA technologies in large-scale, government-run farms or experimental farms first.
    In rural areas, introduce pre-assembled, pre-proofed PA technique modules to farmers
    through extension services or social services, while accumulating experiences
    from PA experiments. Gradually expand the scale of PA applications as the farm
    sizes increase. 3 Extend the concept of PA into precision livestock husbandry,
    precision horticulture, precision post-processing, and precision management. 4
    Develop information- and knowledge-based technology modules to provide strong
    support to agriculture. These modules may include DGPS, GIS, sensors and data-acquisition
    systems for detecting spatial variability of soils and plants, yield monitors,
    yield mapping systems, precision water-saving irrigation systems, spot sprayers,
    animal identification systems, information-management and decision-support systems,
    and multi-media systems. References Adamsen et al., 2000 Adamsen, F.J., Barnes,

    PDF 2.1 Components of Precision Agriculture Ever since the man appeared on the
    earth, he has been harnessing the natural resources to meet his basic requirements.
    The term “precision farming” describes the integration of GIS and GPS tools to
    provide an extensive amount of detailed information on crop growth, crop health,
    crop yield, water absorption, nutrient levels, topography, and soil variability
    (Adrian et al. 2005). It precisely establishes various operations, such as the
    best tillage, application of fertilizer, sowing, irrigation, harvesting, etc.,
    and turns traditional extensive production to intensive production according to
    space variable data. It not only utilize fully resources, reduce investment, decrease
    pollution of the environment, and get the most of social and economic efficiency
    but also makes farm products, the same as industry, become controllable and be
    produced in standards and batches (Khan 2013). Thus, specific objectives of precision
    agriculture are to increase profitability, increase production, reduce variable
    costs, reduce erosion, reduce the environmental impact of chemicals, track and
    monitor the use of chemicals, and manage large farms (Atherton et al. 1999; Olson
    1998). However, precision farming has been confined to developed countries. Land
    tenure system, smaller farm size (<1 ha), and crop diversity have limited the
    scope of precision farming in India. However, there is a wide scope for precision
    farming in irrigated/commercial/fruit and vegetable crops/high value crops. It
    is apparent that there is a tremendous scope for precision farming in India as
    well, and it is necessary to develop database of agriculture resources, which
    will act as decision support system at the farm (<1 ha) level. Generally, three
    major components of precision agriculture are information, technology, and management.
    Base on these three principles, we can define PA in different ways. Precision
    farming is information-intense. A lot of data are required to generate treatment
    maps, and many techniques are underdevelopment or have been developed during the
    last decade. Earlier, precision agriculture encompassed three “Rs”: the right
    time, the right amount, and the right place (Robert et al. 1994). Later, the International
    Plant Nutrition Institute added another “R” to that list, “the Right Source,”
    and more recently an additional “R,” the right manner, has also been proposed
    (Khosla 2008). Precision agriculture is a management strategy that uses information
    technologies to bring data from multiple sources to bear on decisions associated
    with crop production (National Research Council 1997). It allows for the management
    of spatial and temporal variability within a field, reduction of costs, improvement
    of yield quantity and quality, and reduction of environmental impacts. In other
    hand, PA can be defined as a set of technologies that have helped propel agriculture
    into the computerized information-based world and is designed to help farmers
    get greater control over the management of farm operations (Gandonou 2005). Precision
    farming is based on several separate technologies, yet interdependent parts, which
    together form the basis for individual management systems. Precision farming technology
    (PFT) is designed to provide information and data to assist farmers when making
    site-specific management (SSM) decisions. Demand for information about technologies
    to manage agricultural production systems increased with the advent of yield monitors
    and global positioning systems, etc., and improvements in computing power and
    data management (Swinton and Lowenberg-DeBoer 1998). The following section outlines
    the most prevalent systems that are used in PA. The key elements required for
    generation, dissemination, and adoption of precision farming techniques, therefore,
    include information, technology, and managements. Information is needed about
    crop characteristics, soil properties (topography, fertility status, texture,
    moisture content/retention, tillage needs, salinity, waterlogging, etc.), incidence
    of pests (insects, diseases, weeds, and others), weather/climatic conditions,
    other biotic and abiotic stresses, plant growth response, harvest and postharvest
    handling, marketing and market intelligence, socioeconomic conditions of farmers,
    etc. Detailed information, so collected, can be used to create different kinds
    of maps of the farms/villages/regions (e.g., different soil characteristics, groundwater,
    pest incidence, weed distribution, topography, environmental pollution, etc.)
    which can help the farmers in using the available information at each step while
    making site-specific decisions for performing different farm operations. Planners
    can use these maps for regulating the supplies of inputs in different areas. Technologies
    are rapidly evolving, and farmers must keep up with the changes that can help
    in increasing productivity and profitability. Use of remote sensing and geographic
    information system (GIS), auto-analysers, sensors, computers along with appropriate
    software, etc. can help in precisely identifying areas of nutrient deficiencies
    and other biotic and abiotic stresses, etc., and quantifying the quantification
    of the economic significance of the soil-water-fertilizer-pest-crop-related constraints
    and their environmental impacts at the farm/village/region levels. They can provide
    useful guidance for adopting the systems of integrated management of soil health,
    nutrients, pests, water, energy, and different crop genetic resources. By using
    sensors postharvest quality of the produce can be monitored and enhanced. Efficient
    management of the suite of technologies is of paramount importance. This will
    combine information obtained and the available technology into a comprehensive
    management system. Without proper management precision, crop production will not
    be possible. Farmers must know how to interpret available information, how to
    utilize the technology, and how to make sound production and decisions. The complexity
    of agriculture and diverse expertise needed for the development and dissemination
    of knowledge-intensive precision farming technologies require multidisciplinary
    efforts of agronomists, plant breeders, soil scientists, agro-meteorologists,
    entomologists, plant pathologists, weed scientists, biotechnologists, economists,
    extension workers, and farmers. Paradigm shifts are needed in the systems of generation,
    transfer, and adoption. Systems approach needs to be followed to integrate, synthesize,
    and process information, and develop computer-simulated crop production models.
    User-friendly computer software can in turn guide the farmers in making appropriate
    decisions for performing site-specific farm operations. User-oriented cost-effective
    technologies generated through such efforts will help in ensuring the adoption
    of precision farming technologies by the farmers. 2.2 Spatial Data Management
    Field is not one uniform unit. In principle, all parameters and farming practices
    can be a part of a site-specific resource management. 2.2.1 Geographical Positioning
    Precision farming, as we know it today, started in the late 1980s with the advent
    of the global positioning system (GPS) into the agricultural sector, when it was
    realized how much farming data were spatially related (Blackmore 2003). Geographical
    positioning with GPS or DGPS (differential GPS) is the “backbone” of most PF practices.
    It is essential for most site-specific practices that a specific action is recorded
    and positioned in order to use the information for future treatments. With a positioning
    system, it is possible to gather information site-specifically. The global positioning
    system (GPS) makes possible to record the in-field variability as geographically
    encoded data (Nemenyi et al. 2003). An alternative to the GPS system, the Russian
    GLONASS satellite system is developed, which in principle is similar to the GPS
    system and based on several satellites. The global positioning system (GPS) is
    one of the key technologies that make precision agriculture possible. GPS receivers
    with sufficient accuracy for yield mapping, grid sampling, variable rate application,
    and other precision activities are available at moderate cost. GPS receivers,
    which provide accurate, geo-referenced position information, are often used with
    combine yield monitors, scouting equipment, or variable rate application machinery
    (Stombaugh et al. 2002). Several factors, including the satellite and receiver
    clock limitations, ephemeris variation, satellite configuration, atmospheric interference,
    multipath, and selective availability (SA) can cause errors in GPS position information.
    The most common way to counteract GPS errors is by using differential GPS or DGPS.
    The differential global positioning system (DGPS) is an integration of space-based
    and ground-based segments that together comprise a radio-navigation facility (Shearer
    et al. 1999). In a DGPS system, a GPS receiver is placed at an accurately known
    location. This base station receiver will calculate GPS errors by comparing its
    actual location to the location computed from the GPS signals. This error information
    is sent to the rover receiver, which uses it to correct the position information
    it computes from the GPS signals. DGPS corrections can be broadcast by tower-based
    or satellite-based systems (Fig. 2.1). Fig. 2.1 DGPS tower-based (left) and satellite-based
    systems Full size image By using the geographical positioning system, it is possible
    to locate the information for further analysis and make a visual presentation
    in a GIS system. Precision farming provides a new solution using a systems approach
    for today’s agricultural issues such as the need to balance productivity with
    environmental concerns. It is based on advanced information technology. It includes
    describing and modeling variation in soils and plant species and integrating agricultural
    practices to meet site-specific requirements. It aims at increased economic returns,
    as well as at reducing the energy input and the environmental impact of agriculture.
    2.2.2 Geographical Information System In order to save your geographical position
    and site-specific field characteristics, it is an indispensable to have a geographical
    information system (GIS) platform to save and handle spatial information. The
    GIS created by computing background makes possible to generate complex view about
    our fields and to make valid agro-technological decisions. Most GIS systems are
    reliable but also fairly expensive depending on the features and capabilities
    of the program. A GIS is a set of computer tools that allows one to work with
    data that are tied to a particular location or spatially mapped area on the earth.
    A GIS is a database that is specifically designed to work with map data (Price
    2006). GIS is the merger of attribute and a geographic database. This allows for
    multiple detailed data to be graphically depicted on a map and utilized for decision-making.
    Farmers have long since utilized maps for data collection and decision-making.
    However, the difference with applying the advanced technology of GIS is that the
    GIS map exhibits “intelligence” where you can ask a question and get an answer.
    GIS technology application is influencing decision-making because it avoids the
    shortcomings of traditional maps, allows for the rapid computer analysis, and
    applies sophisticated data structures. GIS is used as a data synthesizing and
    decision-support tool in many fields (Mickle 2009). GIS is a spatial decision
    support system, not a decision-making system. A GIS software program enables the
    farmer to assemble and organize different sources of site-specific and geographical
    data information in various layers. Each layer in GIS is termed “coverage” and
    consisting of topologically linked geographic features and associated data. 2.2.3
    Remote Sensing Remote sensing is the science and art of acquiring information
    about the earth’s surface without actually coming in contact with it. This is
    done by recording energy, which is either reflected or emitted from the earth’s
    surface. The information recorded is then processed and analyzed, and the information
    is used to develop a prescription map that can be used in a variable rate application
    (Grisso et al. 2011). This technology can be used to obtain various layers of
    information about soil and crop conditions. It allows detection and/or characterization
    of an object, series of objects, or the landscape without having the sensor in
    physical contact with the soil. It uses aerial or satellite imaging to sense crop
    vegetation and identify crop stresses and injuries or pest infestation. So far
    satellite images have mainly been used to produce maps and predict yield potentials
    on large areas. With higher resolution and near-infrared and red sensing, it is
    possible to map the relative reflectance from the crop in a small scale. 2.3 Soil
    Sampling and Mapping A variety of different soils exist across any given field.
    Also, a field may contain a low level of one nutrient and a high level of another
    nutrient. Soil sampling and testing are the best ways to identify these differences
    and to adjust liming and fertilization practices. Both grid and directed sampling
    are used to describe soil properties for management of variable rates of fertility.
    Grid soil sampling involves sampling at points on a square grid throughout a field.
    An alternative to grid sampling is directed sampling, which involves dividing
    a field into regular or irregular management zones based on features such as soil
    type, topography, or past yield performance. In either system, collect at least
    five or six subsamples from each cell or zone and mix them into one sample container.
    The soil samples are collected from each section and then forwarded to a laboratory
    for analysis often guided by the advisory service. It is absolutely necessary
    to take care to assure that the soil sample you send to the laboratory accurately
    represents the area sampled (Thom et al. 1997). When soil fertility data is returned
    from the soil testing lab, you can enter the data into your mapping program to
    create fertility maps. Gathering of soil data from soil samples to create a soil
    map is a relatively expensive and time-consuming task but have also valuable information
    for later treatments with fertilizers and design of decision support systems.
    A soil analysis can identify some of the limiting factors regarding yield and
    growth potential for the specific crop on a specific spot in the field. Soil test
    results should be included in a record system for each production field on a farm,
    along with the amounts of lime and fertilizer applied each year, the crops grown,
    and the yields obtained. 2.4 Yield Monitoring and Mapping Yield monitors and maps
    form a very important part of a PF system. Yield monitors are a logical first
    step for those who want to begin practicing SSCM. The yield monitor which predicts
    yield from other variables is intended to give the user an accurate assessment
    of how yields vary within a field. With a yield monitor, a producer also can conduct
    on-farm variety trials or weed control evaluations without the need of a weigh
    wagon. Such on-farm comparisons help producers fine-tune crop production practices
    to their soils. Yield monitors are a combination of several components. They typically
    include several different sensors and other components, including a data storage
    device, user interface (display and key pad), and a task computer located in the
    combine cab, which controls the integration and interaction of these components.
    The sensors measure the mass or the volume of grain flow (grain flow sensors),
    separator speed, ground speed, grain moisture, and header height. The sensors
    are interfaced with both analog to digital and direct digital inputs. Yield is
    determined as a product of the various parameters being sensed (Shearer et al.
    1999). Grain volume flow sensor is prone to errors on slopes as the grain can
    slip to one side and block the beam. By adding slope sensors, this has been accounted
    for. Yield monitoring values can be exported to a personal computer and stored
    in nonvolatile memory for further analysis or printing via specialized software
    packages. Yield data were recorded and analyzed over 10 years, resulting in a
    rich data set for both spatial and temporal trend analysis 5. Variable-rate rechnology
    (VRT) is the equipment with the ability to change the application rate and mixture
    as it moves across the field. VRT adjust pesticide, herbicide, and seeding application
    rates to match soil potentials or problem areas (Adamchuck and Mulliken 2005).
    Roberts et al. (2001) reported that N losses to the environment were lower with
    VRT than with uniform rate application (URA), except on fields with little spatial
    variability and management information. 2.5 Differential Global Positioning System
    The differential global positioning system (DGPS) is an integration of space-
    and ground-based segments that together comprise a radio-navigation facility.
    Initially developed for national security interests, a portion of the DGPS system
    is available to civilian users (Fig. 2.2). When yield data are used with information
    generated by a DGPS receiver, a producer can generate yield maps that provide
    a quick visualization of crop performance within a particular crop production
    unit. Ultimately, any increased profit realized from incorporating a yield monitor
    into an operation will come from changes in management practices that result from
    the identification of problem areas using such yield maps. With DGPS, the benefits
    of using a yield monitor are even more evident (Shearer et al. 1999). Fig. 2.2
    Diagrammatic representation of DGPS Full size image 2.6 Variable Rate Application
    and Technology The concept of PF has the potential of aiding farmers to use nutrients
    and chemicals in an efficient way according to crop needs at a given site on the
    field and thereby make farming more economically competitive and sustainable.
    Application (VRA) of nutrients has the potential to improve the specific crop
    quality in a number of rotations, for example, to obtain certain protein content
    in cereals, in particular wheat for bakery flour and barley for malting. Variable-rate
    technology (VRT) is the equipment with the ability to change the application rate
    and mixture as it moves across the field. VRT adjust pesticide, herbicide, and
    seeding application rates to match soil potentials or problem areas (Adamchuck
    and Mulliken 2005). Six main sources of errors of yield measurement that have
    been identified are unknown crop width entering the header during harvest, time
    lag of grain through the threshing mechanism, the inherent wandering error from
    the GPS, surging grain through the combine transport system, grain losses from
    the combine, and sensor accuracy and calibration (Blackmore and Marshall 1996).
    Yield mapping is one application of data analysis where the process of observation,
    interpretation, evaluation, and implementation can be applied. Yield mapping software
    can be purchased as a part of an overall investment in a combine harvester or
    separately. The two basic technologies for VRA are map-based and sensor-based.
    Map-based VRA adjusts the application rate based on an electronic map, also called
    a prescription map. Using the field position from a GPS receiver and a prescription
    map of desired rate, the concentration of input is changed as the applicator moves
    through the field. Canopy management can be conducted with a combination of crop
    sensors and real-time modeling. Sensor-based VRA requires no map or positioning
    system. Sensors on the applicator measure soil properties or crop characteristics
    “on the go.” Based on this continuous stream of information, a control system
    calculates the input needs of the soil or plants and transfers the information
    to a controller, which delivers the input to the location measured by the sensor
    (Grisso et al. 2011). 2.7 Section Control Precision agriculture technology has
    evolved in such a manner that it provides farmers with new and innovative ways
    to possibly improve profitability. One of these ways is a new approach to the
    application of liquid chemicals and other inputs known as automatic section control.
    Automatic section control on a sprayer has the ability to selectively manage input
    application across the spray boom. This technology utilizes a global positioning
    system (GPS) to locate the position of the sprayer within the field and then records
    the areas covered. If the sprayer traverses an area previously covered, it can
    automatically turn the appropriate section off, therefore eliminating over application.
    In addition, automatic section control can manage chemical application in undesirable
    areas such as point rows, waterways, and during headland turns. The largest benefit
    associated with automatic section control is the reduction in overlapped areas
    especially prevalent on irregular-shaped fields. As a result, this new technology
    has the potential to increase profits due to reducing input costs. Environmental
    benefits are also possible due to the ability to manage buffer zones and protect
    sensitive areas in and around the field. Furthermore, improved efficiency can
    occur if coupled with a navigational aide such as light bar or auto-steer (Shockley
    2010). Once a prototype was created and farm trials were conducted, Dillon et
    al. (2007) examined the economic implications of utilizing automatic section control.
    Mooney et al. (2009) conducted the most recent economic analysis, and determined
    automatic section control became profitable at input saving levels of 11% or above.
    2.8 Guidance Systems There are two classifications of guidance systems for agricultural
    production: guidance aides and autonomous systems. Guidance aides are devices
    that provide guidance information to the operator and still require the operator
    to fully control the machines operations. The intent of the autonomous system
    is to free up the operator of the machine from the guidance task and thus improve
    operating efficiency. 2.8.1 Guidance Aid The term guidance aide refers to devices
    that provide guidance information to the operator but do not attempt to replace
    the operator (Ima and Mann 2004). One of the most broadly adopted and more recently
    developed methods to reduce guidance error is the light bar technology. The main
    function of light bar is to assist the machine operator in driving, thus decreasing
    operator fatigue and minimizing application errors of overlaps and skips. Most
    light bar systems include a differential GPS (DGPS) receiver and antenna, some
    kind of computer or microprocessor, and a light bar or graphics display (Stombaugh
    2002). From the study of cost maps, Kayrouz (2008) indicated that inaccuracy of
    machinery movement, whether in the application stage or the harvesting stage,
    is very costly. Light bar gives a visual guide that changes colors as the operator
    veers off the desired path. Previous technologies were developed with the idea
    of achieving the same goal, for example, planter markers and foam markers. Both
    of these previous technologies are becoming shadowed by light bar and its effectiveness
    in improving farm profitability. As a result, foam and planter markers are becoming
    an obsolete technology (Kayrouz 2008). 2.8.2 Autonomous Field Machinery According
    to Haapala et al. (2006), as human capacity to handle simultaneous information
    is limited, new intelligence has been developed between the user and the system
    to be controlled. The intelligent layer decides which kind of information is passed
    on for the user and which part is used for other purposes. Introduction of small,
    light-weight robots that can perform agricultural tasks autonomously may prove
    to be a realistic option for farmers in the future. These robots will likely operate
    in fleets and utilize intelligent controls to cooperate with each other to perform
    tasks such as scouting for weeds and diseases, yield and field mapping, and plant-specific
    operations like sowing and fertilizing (Shockley 2010). The role of automation
    should be designed so that automation helps the individual user to simultaneously
    avoid stress and increase efficiency of work. 2.9 Conclusions Precision farming
    is still only a concept in many developing countries, and strategic support from
    the public and private sectors is essential to promote its rapid adoption. Successful
    adoption, however, comprises at least three phases including exploration, analysis,
    and execution. Precision agriculture can address both economic and environmental
    issues that surround production agriculture today. Questions remain about cost-effectiveness
    and the most effective ways to use the technological tools we now have, but the
    concept of “doing the right thing in the right place at the right time” has a
    strong intuitive appeal. In the light of today’s urgent need, there should be
    an all-out effort to use new technological inputs to make the “Green Revolution”
    as an “Evergreen Revolution.” Ultimately, the success of precision agriculture
    depends largely on how well and how quickly the knowledge needed to guide the
    new technologies can be found. References Adamchuck, V. I., & Mulliken, J. (2005).

    Abstract: Climate change is emerging as a major threat to farming, food security\
    \ and the livelihoods\nof millions of people across the world. Agriculture is\
    \ strongly affected by climate change due to\nincreasing temperatures, water shortage,\
    \ heavy rainfall and variations in the frequency and intensity\nof excessive climatic\
    \ events such as ﬂoods and droughts. Farmers need to adapt to climate change by\n\
    developing advanced and sophisticated farming systems instead of simply farming\
    \ at lower intensity\nand occupying more land. Integrated agricultural systems\
    \ constitute a promising solution, as they can\nlower reliance on external inputs,\
    \ enhance nutrient cycling and increase natural resource use efﬁciency.\nIn this\
    \ context, the concept of Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA) emerged as a promising\
    \ solution to\nsecure the resources for the growing world population under climate\
    \ change conditions. This work\nproposes a CSA architecture for fostering and\
    \ supporting integrated agricultural systems, such as\nMixed Farming Systems (MFS),\
    \ by facilitating the design, the deployment and the management of\ncrop–livestock-=forestry\
    \ combinations towards sustainable, efﬁcient and climate resilient agricultural\n\
    systems. Propelled by cutting-edge technology solutions in data collection and\
    \ processing, along\nwith fully autonomous monitoring systems, e.g., smart sensors\
    \ and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs),\nthe proposed architecture called MiFarm-CSA,\
    \ aims to foster core interactions among animals, forests\nand crops, while mitigating\
    \ the high complexity of these interactions, through a novel conceptual\nframework.\n\

    \ Introduction\nStarvation is one of the biggest threats we are facing as humanity\
    \ in the 21st century.\nThe global demand for food is increasing, with recent\
    \ studies forecasting that the global\npopulation will reach 9.5 billion people\
    \ by 2050 [1], and more than 80% of available land\nis already cultivated [2].\
    \ Global demand for farming products is expected to increase\nby 70% for food\
    \ production [3] and double for livestock products by 2050 [4]. However,\nagricultural\
    \ production is strongly affected by the changes in climate conditions, such as\n\
    rising temperatures [5], changing rainfall regimes [6] and variations in the frequency\
    \ and\nintensity of extreme climatic events such as ﬂoods and droughts [7]. The\
    \ estimated impacts\nof the climate change indicates that the yield loss could\
    \ be up to 35% for rice, 20% for\nwheat, 50% for sorghum, 13% for barley and 60%\
    \ for maize [8], and livestock production\nwill be also negatively affected [4].\n\
    Both farmers and breeders need to ﬁnd efﬁcient and affordable methods in order\
    \ to\nstrengthen the resilience of agriculture and livestock farming against climate\
    \ change. The\nTelecom 2021, 2, 52–74. https://doi.org/10.3390/telecom2010005\n\

    \ Agriculture (CSA) reﬂects an ambition to improve the resilience\nof agricultural\
    \ systems against climate change [9–11]. The Food and Agriculture Organiza-\n\
    tion (FAO) of the United Nations deﬁnes CSA as agriculture that enhances productivity,\n\
    improves resilience, reduces greenhouse gases (GHG) and facilitates the achievement\
    \ of\nnational food security and development goals [9]. The CSA includes both\
    \ traditional and\ninnovative approaches; and technologies that promote agricultural\
    \ productivity, increase\nthe stability at the farm level and foster the sustainability\
    \ of the relevant value chains [11].\nA system that adopts the concept of CSA\
    \ is expected to increase its resilience against\nﬂuctuating climate conditions\
    \ and therefore offer increased food production in the face of a\nchanging climate\
    \ and increased climate variability, while improving nutritional outcomes\nand\
    \ reducing the carbon cost of farming and its contribution to GHG emissions [12–15].\n\
    It includes three major pillars: (a) increasing agricultural productivity; (b)\
    \ increasing\nadaptive capacity at multiple scales (from farm to nation); and\
    \ (c) reducing greenhouse\ngas emissions [12]. While there is a consensus on the\
    \ potential of the CSA to support\nglobal food and nutritional security in less-favored\
    \ conditions [11–13], CSA scholars have\ndifferent perspectives when approaching\
    \ the scaling of CSA options.\nIntegrated systems can combine crop production,\
    \ livestock and forestry, supporting\nthe production of at least three types of\
    \ product from the same land area over a deﬁned\nperiod [16–18]. These systems,\
    \ based on inter-cropping, succession and/or rotation, can\noptimize the biological\
    \ cycling of nutrients between plants and animals, and maintain long-\nterm soil\
    \ fertility [19–21]. According to the FAO, Mixed Farming Systems (MFS) are deﬁned\n\
    as farming systems managed by households and/or enterprises where crop cultivation\
    \ and\nlivestock rearing together form integrated components of a single farming\
    \ system. MFS\noffer a lot of advantages, such as efﬁcient use of resources by\
    \ using crops and grassland to\nfeed animals and fertilize their ﬁelds with manure\
    \ from the animals, complementarities\nbetween crops and livestock and a ﬂexibility\
    \ that allows the adjustment of crop/livestock\nratios in anticipation of risks,\
    \ opportunities and needs [19,22,23]. Such context-relevant\nintegration of crops\
    \ and animals in the same system appears to support a biological,\necological\
    \ and economic sustainability in the global food production chain [17,18,23].\n\
    Nevertheless, MFS is not a universal panacea. The economic results of MFS are\
    \ not as\noptimal as those of dedicated systems, especially considering the remuneration\
    \ of labor.\nThis is the reason why MFS are usually established in less-favored\
    \ areas, e.g., mountains or\nsloppy areas, rough landscapes and heterogeneous\
    \ terrains, where conventional farming\nor breeding does not usually take place\
    \ [24]. In order to achieve a satisﬁed level of sustain-\nability under these\
    \ conditions, MFS should be able to effectively monitor the farm area, the\nanimals\
    \ and the grasslands. That is a difﬁcult task, as MFS are extremely complex systems\n\
    that include interactions between climate and weather, surface and sub-surface\
    \ soil, crops,\npastures, animal production and human management with economic\
    \ components [25].\nCritical features such as income stability and sustainability\
    \ need special quality dimensions,\ncriteria and indicators for the evaluation\
    \ of trans-disciplinary processes [26]. Moreover,\nthe climate, through weather\
    \ patterns, as time progresses, play a decisive role, as rainfall\nand temperature\
    \ drive the productivity, proﬁtability and environmental health of the\nsystem.\
    \ In addition, there is a need for reducing the energy needed to maintain the\
    \ MFS\noperation. Another challenge is related to the role of research on MFS\
    \ and the need for\nmulti-disciplinary knowledge integration. A lack of integration\
    \ between the research of\ndifferent disciplines, such as agronomists, veterinarians\
    \ and social scientists, limits the\nnecessary integral vision and makes MFS difﬁcult\
    \ to implement [27]. Moreover, science\nlacks inﬂuence mainly because of biases\
    \ towards academic research rather than practical\napplications [28]. It should\
    \ be noticed, however, that this lack of knowledge integration\nis not always\
    \ the case. There are countries that present signiﬁcant progress in integrated\n\
    farming systems from both practical and research perspectives [18]. The complexity\
    \ of\nusing MFS is increased when combining crop and livestock production due\
    \ to the increase\nof the management demands of organizing multi-tasking activities.\
    \ Considering that\nﬁnding reliable labor with the required skills in specialized\
    \ farming systems is difﬁcult\nTelecom 2021, 2\n54\nenough [29]; the problem becomes\
    \ even more acute in a diversiﬁed farming system that\nrequires the aggregation\
    \ of various kind of knowledge and skills. Additionally, for a mixed\nfarming\
    \ system, the bureaucratic and administrative workload, which requires expertise\n\
    that especially older farmers do not possess [29], is expected to increase compared\
    \ to a\nspecialized farm.\nThe success of MFS depends heavily on the aggregation\
    \ of data, which is either\nproduced by or affects the MFS, given that new technologies\
    \ and solutions are effectively\napplied in order to collect, process and use\
    \ it during decision making [30]. Precision\nagriculture is a method in which\
    \ farmers optimize inputs such as water and fertilizer\nto enhance productivity,\
    \ quality and yield. The fact that farmers are more precise with\nplanting, harvesting,\
    \ fertilizing leads to higher efﬁciency and productivity of the farm while\necological\
    \ standards are respected [31]. Today, mobile applications [32], smart sensors\
    \ [33],\nunmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) [34], cloud computing [35] and edge computing\
    \ [31]\nmake precision agriculture possible for farming cooperatives. It goes\
    \ without saying that\nthe implementation of MFS requires extended technological\
    \ features, such as sophisticated\nequipment, extended monitoring range, real-time\
    \ processing capabilities and specialized\nartiﬁcial intelligence (AI) models.\n\
    Although precision agriculture is characterized by high complexity and depends\n\
    heavily on cutting edge technologies, it constitutes a method that soon or later\
    \ is going\nbe used across the globe. Developed countries, such as USA, Australia,\
    \ Canada and\nsome European countries, including Germany, Finland, Sweden and\
    \ Denmark, have\nmade signiﬁcant progress towards this area and already show some\
    \ level of adoption\nof precision agriculture [36]. In developing countries instead,\
    \ the acquisition of cutting\nedge technologies and the lack of suitable infrastructure\
    \ constitute major impediments\nto precision agriculture exploitation. Although\
    \ precision agriculture, as it can be found\nin North America, Australia and Europe,\
    \ differs considerably in developing countries,\nthe need for accurate data and\
    \ targeted interventions is actually greater there, due to the\nstronger imperative\
    \ for change and the lack of resources [37]. What is really encouraging is\nthat\
    \ over the past few years there has been considerable effort from developing countries\n\
    to use some kinds of precision agriculture methods in various applications, such\
    \ as yield\nmonitoring and tractor auto guidance [36].\nIn developing countries,\
    \ MFS play an important role, as in some cases they act as\nthe backbone of a\
    \ sustainable agricultural policy, especially for individual farmers or\nsmall\
    \ farming communities [38]. During the last decades, research efforts in various\n\
    developing countries have been redirected to integrated farming systems rather\
    \ than\ndedicated ones, so as to cover several complementary enterprises under\
    \ various agro-\necological situations [39–41]. These efforts revealed that integrated\
    \ farming systems can not\nonly be proﬁtable and productive but also eco-friendly,\
    \ a countermeasure to unemployment\nand provide ﬁnancial stability to the stakeholders\
    \ [42].\nDesigning and applying integrated farming systems has severe constraints.\
    \ Towards\nthe technological direction, a severe constraint is the lack of long-term,\
    \ structured, concrete\ndata [43]. In the best scenarios so far, end users’ actions\
    \ heavily depend on short-term,\nbiased data. As a result, data analytic services\
    \ fail to operate on a larger scale since they\nare highly affected by area peculiarities\
    \ and seasonality [44]. That explains the fact that\ndifferent frameworks and\
    \ assessment schemes result in contradictory outcomes. Examining\nMFS implementations\
    \ in view of the end-user, a new kind of barrier that lies in farmers’\nwillingness\
    \ to cooperate, emerges. This barrier goes beyond technical solutions, adding\
    \ a\nsocio-economic dimension to the widespread exploitation of MFS.\nMiFarm-CSA\
    \ architecture aims at providing a CSA-based, multi-actor and community-\noriented\
    \ architecture, for advancing the current farming system to a smart, resilient\
    \ and\nintegrated/mixed farming ecosystem, aiming at increasing the resilience\
    \ of the underlying\nfarms, crops, livestock and forestry against the negative\
    \ impacts of the climate change.\nMoreover, the proposed architecture envisions\
    \ to foster cooperation between farmers and\nbreeders through the provision of\
    \ a sustainable MFS reference model.\nTelecom 2021, 2\n55\nThe remaining paper\
    \ is organized as follows: Section 2 highlights the current state-of-\nthe-art.\
    \ Section 3 presents the MiFarm-CSA architecture thoroughly; it illustrates the\
    \ four\nlayers of the architecture and delves into them in each of the subsections.\
    \ Section 4 outlines\nthe beneﬁts of the proposed architecture. In Section 5 the\
    \ conclusions are summarized.\n2. Related Work\nCurrent section reﬂects the current\
    \ state of the art in integrated agricultural systems\nfrom technological, economic\
    \ and social perspectives. It also points out current weaknesses\nthat tend to\
    \ be exacerbated due to the high complexity of a MFS.\n2.1. Data Aggregation Systems\n\
    Improving mixed farm productivity is essential for increasing farm proﬁtability\
    \ and\nmeeting the rapidly growing demand for food that is fueled by rapid population\
    \ growth\nacross the world and decreasing demand for energy. Mixed-farm productivity\
    \ can be\nincreased by understanding and forecasting crop and livestock performance\
    \ in a variety of\nenvironmental, social and ecological conditions. Both crop\
    \ and livestock recommendations\nare currently based on data collected in ﬁeld-based\
    \ agricultural studies that capture perfor-\nmance under a variety of conditions\
    \ (e.g., soil quality, diseases, environmental conditions,\netc.). The quality\
    \ of manually collected performance data is very low, because it does not\ntake\
    \ into account earlier conditions that have not been observed by the human operators,\n\
    but it is essential to ﬁlter out collected data that will lead to invalid conclusions.\
    \ Further-\nmore, due to MFS, we must increase the volume of data, the number\
    \ of the sources and the\nenergy demands for efﬁcient communication, consequently\
    \ increasing the complexity of\nthe data gathering process exponentially. To this\
    \ end, the utilization of emerging technolo-\ngies such as IoT devices, ground\
    \ sensors, livestock sensors (collars/ear-tags), multispectral\ncameras and UAVs\
    \ for data gathering purposes, is quite mature nowadays, and they can\nbe used\
    \ to collate vast amounts of environmental and crop-livestock performance data,\n\
    ranging from time series data from sensors, to spatial data from cameras, to human\
    \ obser-\nvations collected and recorded via smart applications [45]. More speciﬁcally,\
    \ their beneﬁts\nare extended in the whole spectrum of the agricultural ecosystem.\
    \ Their deployment\ndecreases the farmer’s labor tasks, facilitating his daily\
    \ routine and making resource alloca-\ntion more efﬁcient. Moreover, the quality\
    \ and quantity of data are improving and being\nenriched respectively, providing\
    \ insights that enhance productivity while sustainable and\neco-friendly processes\
    \ are identiﬁed and fostered. Precision agriculture and data analytics\nare reshaping\
    \ industry and market boundaries and interactions, with precision agricul-\nture\
    \ technologies (data holding, data specialization, data strategy) being a combination\n\
    of: Global Positioning System (GPS), sensors mounted on farm machines or standalone,\n\
    geo-mapping, automatics steering systems, electronic communications and variable\
    \ rate\ntechnologies [46]. Increasing UAVs’ obligations results in a higher energy\
    \ consumption, a\nfact that could disrupt the sustainability and eventually the\
    \ viability of the system [47]. In-\ntelligent devices are deployed to collect\
    \ specialized data and provide valuable information.\nSuch devices are photonics\
    \ which are utilized for monitoring and predicting the ripening\nprocess and quality\
    \ of produce, ear-tags that gather information about animals’ nutrition\nand multi-spectral\
    \ cameras that collect images in different spectrums. The incorporation\nof such\
    \ devices intensiﬁes data diversity, raising concerns about interoperability between\n\
    the physical components, data processing and information integration capabilities\
    \ [48].\nObviously, these new trends on the one hand manage to handle some of\
    \ the MFS concerns,\nbut on the other hand reveal new challenges that need to\
    \ be addressed.\n2.2. Socio-Technical and Socio-Economic Modeling\nModeling and\
    \ simulation tools can help in identifying opportunities for improved\nresource\
    \ management, crop production and farm system sustainability. Modeling tools may\n\
    also be used to predict the longer-term effects of suggested interventions and\
    \ technologies\nand to enhance the understanding of their impacts [49]. One such\
    \ tool developed in the\nTelecom 2021, 2\n56\ncontext of African smallholder farmers\
    \ is the integrated crop-livestock model NUANCES-\nFARMSIM [50]. Agricultural\
    \ Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) is the most used\nsimulator for agriculture\
    \ proposes. Since 1990, it has grown from a ﬁeld-focused farming\nsystems framework\
    \ used by a small number of people, into a large collection of models\nused by\
    \ thousands of modelers internationally. In this vein, APSIM Initiative is developing\n\
    the next generation of APSIM [51].\nFRAM and STAMP represent the current state-of-the-art\
    \ for socio-technical model-\ning [52]. Both are deliberately lacking theoretical\
    \ background about socio-technical system\ndynamics. Thus, the structure of modeling\
    \ and inquiry is retrospective [53–55]. They are\nhindered in their utility and\
    \ applicability by this theoretical vacuum. New methods are\nneeded which are\
    \ situated in a well-considered and thought-out theoretical landscape and\nwhich\
    \ are based on evidence [56,57].\nRecent literature suggests that understanding\
    \ and considering the role of behav-\nioral factors in farmers’ adoption of sustainable\
    \ practices can help enrich the traditional\neconomic analysis of farmers’ decision-making\
    \ [58]. Within this literature, there is a bur-\ngeoning stream investigating\
    \ the role of behavioral factors. Pre-testing the impacts of\nthese behavioral\
    \ factors on farmers’ decision making can, in turn, lead to more effective\nagro-environmental\
    \ policies, a crucial challenge in view of the enhanced environmental\nand climate\
    \ ambitions for the future Common Agricultural Policy [59,60].\nMoreover, economic\
    \ experiments can be used effectively to improve the design and\nimplementation\
    \ of agriculture policy and programs. Recent developments have raised\nconﬁdence\
    \ in experiments as a useful tool for economic and policy analysis [61,62]. Beyond\n\
    their role in reshaping how economic research is conducted, social science experiments\
    \ have\nbeen used extensively to inﬂuence the designs of both markets and public\
    \ policies [63–65].\nObservation of behavior in a lab is convenient and affords\
    \ a high degree of control over\nthe environment, but the contexts of the laboratory\
    \ and the participants are in many ways\ndissimilar to those in naturally occurring\
    \ environments [66,67].\n2.3. MFS Integration Analysis and Evaluation\nMFS are\
    \ considered efﬁcient designs for sustainable, ecologically-based farming sys-\n\
    tems. The sustainability of MFS relies on the complementarities between crops,\
    \ livestock\nand forestry, and the exchange of resources within them. Not many\
    \ studies are available\nfrom the last years in integrated systems, especially\
    \ those involving all sectors of crops,\nlivestock and forestry together. Two\
    \ use cases were presented in [68], involving crops,\nanimals and grasslands in\
    \ France and Brazil. In [69] is an integration of crops and livestock\napproach,\
    \ which helps farmers to develop a broader understanding of systemic interactions\n\
    between crop and livestock activities on their farms. In [70] the authors presented\
    \ a compre-\nhensive assessment of all integrated systems identiﬁed in Mato Grosso\
    \ by 2012/13. Despite\nthe beneﬁts associated with MFS, little is known about\
    \ these systems or the challenges of\nimplementing them, and only a limited number\
    \ of farmers have adopted them so far.\n2.4. Knowledge-Based Management System\
    \ in Agriculture\nAlthough some work exists in knowledge-based management and\
    \ information sys-\ntems in the agricultural domain, none of it corresponds to\
    \ Mixed Farming Systems. GECO\nis presented in [71], which allows users formalize\
    \ knowledge in a collaborative manner and\nto make it available to a large community.\
    \ In [72] the authors propose a knowledge-based\nmanagement system for exchanging\
    \ and creating knowledge in organic farming. Smart-\nAKIS [73] is a European network\
    \ mainstreaming smart farming technologies among the\nEuropean farmer community,\
    \ aiming to bridge the gap between practitioners and research\non the identiﬁcation\
    \ and delivery of new smart farming solutions to ﬁt the farmers’ needs.\n2.5.\
    \ MFS Services\nDespite the renewed interest in MFS, these systems are facing\
    \ a number of barriers\nand are still declining worldwide, representing about\
    \ 14% of agricultural systems all over\nTelecom 2021, 2\n57\nthe world. The level\
    \ of specialization depends on economic context, labor availability\nand pedo-climatic\
    \ conditions. Despite their theoretical sustainability performance, MFS\nhave\
    \ been disappearing at the farm level. This could be partly explained by their\
    \ low\neconomic performance and social (work) constraints. First of all, MFS are\
    \ not achieving\nequally good economic results to specialized farms. According\
    \ to Farm Accountancy\nData Network (FADN) [74] data, the average productivity\
    \ of mixed farms, in terms of\noutput/input economic value ratio, is comparable\
    \ to the productivity of all European\nfarms. The efﬁciency in input is comparable\
    \ between mixed farming and all types of\nfarms. Still, the income per worker\
    \ in mixed farms remained below the EU-27 average.\nMoreover, direct payments\
    \ represent a substantial part of farm net value added for grazing\nlivestock,\
    \ and mixed and ﬁeld crop farms, due to their average farm size and the historical\n\
    orientations of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) [75].\n2.6. Decision Support\
    \ Systems in Agriculture\nDSS tools are divided into four categories in terms\
    \ of applications: animals and animal\nproducts, land water and environment, crop\
    \ and agribusiness and markets. Examples of\ncrop DSS are MyCrop, ROOTMAP, Yield\
    \ Calculator and SPLAT. For management problems\nin farms, intelligent DSS in\
    \ agriculture have been introduced to monitor and to assist\nfarmers to make decisions\
    \ in a timely manner. However, designing a DSS is quite complex\nand requires\
    \ knowledge from various multidisciplinary areas. Adinarayana et al. [76]\nproposed\
    \ an information, communication and dissemination system called GeoSense. The\n\
    system was designed to help in decision making for precision farming. Other work\
    \ by\nTamayo et al. [77] implemented a DSS for fertilization, crop growth control\
    \ and prediction\nof diseases. Only two types of sensors, temperature and humidity,\
    \ were utilized in their\nsystem. Jiber, Harroud and karmouch [78] focused their\
    \ study on designing a precision\nagricultural monitoring framework. However,\
    \ this study was limited as it did not use test\nbeds to evaluate the performance\
    \ of their monitoring systems. Aiello, Giuseppe et al. [79]\nproposed a methodological\
    \ approach using a majority rule and bioeconomy strategies that\nimplements a\
    \ decision fusion algorithm which allows one to make the decisions about\nthe\
    \ possible risk of pest disease on the basis of the information (dew point temperature,\n\
    leaf temperature, etc.) collected from all sensors of the network. Grigera, Julian\
    \ et al. [80]\npresented three different usability evaluations: a heuristic evaluation,\
    \ a user test and an\nautomated diagnosis, based on 244 farmers and advisors in\
    \ UK, and concluded that the\nmost inﬂuential factor is the “ease to use a DSS”.\n\
    3. MiFarm-CSA Architecture\nMFS is characterized by multiple instances of crops,\
    \ livestock and forestry, which\nmay be in small or large geographical areas.\
    \ Currently, MFS is not characterized by\nintense use of information and communication\
    \ technologies (ICT) and where it exists, it\nis only used separately per farm\
    \ or livestock level. In addition, current approaches are\neither very simplistic,\
    \ omitting important aspect of MFS, or rather complex, making them\nimpossible\
    \ to implement, which generate drawbacks in management and at the economical\n\
    level that prevent farmers from adopting MFS. MiFarm-CSA envisions to constitute\
    \ an\noverall architecture that facilitates data exchange and integration in one\
    \ platform which\nis delivered to the end users as a service, supporting several\
    \ ICT deployments in crops,\nlivestock and forestry, regardless of their geographical\
    \ location. This approach is aiming\nto leverage MFS and improve in economic,\
    \ social and environmental indicators. Figure 1\nillustrates the MiFarm-CSA view\
    \ of MFS against the current state.\nThe proposed architecture follows a layered\
    \ approach since it offers a lot of beneﬁts in\ncomparison with a non-layered\
    \ one. These beneﬁts are summarized below:\n•\nEasier to understand: architecture\
    \ will be easier to understand, not only for the\narchitects who designed it,\
    \ but also for the technicians who are going to build and\nmaintain it and for\
    \ the people who are going to participate in it.\nTelecom 2021, 2\n58\n•\nEasier\
    \ to test: having a layered architecture makes it possible to deﬁne independent\n\
    components much better, which makes component testing easier.\n•\nEasier to extend:\
    \ adding new features or changing current ones is easier in a layered\narchitecture.\n\

    \ MiFarm-CSA concept.\nIn particular, the proposed architecture consists of four\
    \ main layers:\nIntegrated Data Collection Network: In detail, the Integrated\
    \ Data Collection Network\n(IDCON) applies to the area of MFS, to monitor any\
    \ type of crops; livestock and forestry;\nand climate and soil parameters. More\
    \ speciﬁcally, this tier exploits a wide range of Internet\nof Things (IoT) sensors,\
    \ devices, gateways and servers, UAVs and FANETs, which are\ncapable of covering\
    \ large-scale areas for providing big volumes of data in near real time,\nsuch\
    \ as information about the temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed, pH, dissolved\n\
    oxygen levels, temperature, conductivity, etc. IDCON encloses four main tools,\
    \ namely,\nthe data capturing and recording system, which includes the smart sensing\
    \ and tracking\nsensors, the aerial sensing systems and the weather and climate\
    \ control systems; the energy\nmanagement and harvesting system (EMHS); the semantic\
    \ middleware and gateways\n(SMG); and cloud-based event and data analytics (CEDA)\
    \ which includes the livestock\nfarm management system and the cloud application.\n\
    The Social-Ecological Conceptual Framework: The second layer concerns the MiFarm-\n\
    CSA Social-Ecological Conceptual Framework (SECF) which aims to support sophisticated\n\
    capabilities such as integrated farming to yield forecasts, and optimization of\
    \ crop man-\nagement in terms of fertilization, irrigation and sowing density,\
    \ while at the same time\nTelecom 2021, 2\n59\nproviding social learning modules,\
    \ in a user-friendly way, thinking skills, virtual scenarios,\ncase studies and\
    \ long-term predictions, estimations and business-oriented best practices\nbased\
    \ on the input received from the underlying MiFarm-CSA IDCON layer.\nThe Mixed\
    \ Farming as a Service: The top layer of the architecture is the Mixed Farming\n\
    as a Service (MFaS) which provides a set of advanced and efﬁcient user applications\n\
    and services destined to farmers and stakeholders. More speciﬁcally, the MFaS\
    \ encloses\neight main applications, namely: Resource Managers (ReMa), Integrated\
    \ Irrigation and\nFertilization Application (IFRA), Anomaly and Pest Detection\
    \ Tool (APED), Novel Climate\nService and Application (NCSA), Digital Market Radar\
    \ (DiMaRa), Web-based Knowledge\nExchange Service (W-KES) and Integrated Farming\
    \ Systems Economics (IFSEC).\nEvidence-based Assessment Methodology: The last\
    \ layer concerns the MiFarm-CSA\nEvidence-based Assessment Methodology (EVAM),\
    \ which serves as an horizontal layer\nthat covers all the other layers, as the\
    \ socio-economic aspects should be taken into account\nduring all steps of the\
    \ development of MFS. EVAM layer includes the SCOPE methodology\nfor examining\
    \ and creating dynamic process maps focusing on process functionality, social\n\
    cohesion and the mediation of collective knowledge and information cycles. A further\n\
    element of this approach is the social license to operate (SLO) concept. This\
    \ concept relates\nto the continued acceptance of a set of business practices\
    \ or operating procedures by a\ncompany’s employees, stakeholders and the general\
    \ public. In addition, in this layer the\nbehavioral decision-making is also taken\
    \ into account as it is a method to inﬂuence the\nfarmers to adopt environmentally\
    \ suitable practices.\nTable 1, provides brief deﬁnitions of the concepts, technologies\
    \ and practices used in\nMiFarm-CSA architecture.\n3.1. Integrated Data Collection\
    \ Network\nThe provision of an advanced data collection network and autonomous\
    \ monitoring is\na major pillar of MiFarm-CSA, which is realized by the IDCON.\

    \ telecommunication wide area network designed to allow\nlong-range communications\
    \ at a low bit rate among things,\nsuch as sensors operated on a battery.\nGeographic\
    \ Information System\nA conceptualized framework that provides the\nability to\
    \ capture and analyze spatial and geographic data.\nInitially, the data capturing\
    \ and recording takes place by using the SST, ASSM and\nWCCF. SST includes electronic\
    \ sensors (passive and active wireless sensor devices) for\nenvironmental monitoring\
    \ (quality of water, soil, air and nutrition concentration), phyto-\nelectronic\
    \ sensors for measuring environmental and soil changes via metabolic changes\n\
    in plants (e.g., pH level and phytohormones) and soil-derived GHG emissions sensors\n\
    that measure the effects of regenerative grazing regime and mixed farming practices\
    \ on\nGHG losses. In addition, low-cost IoT-enabled GHG sensors are utilized for\
    \ measuring\nthe effects of emissions on local and regional levels. Since animal\
    \ tracking is of paramount\nimportance in any MFS, specialized IoT devices (e.g.,\
    \ collars and ear-tags) are also utilized\nfor locating, monitoring and managing\
    \ livestock. Beyond the conventional information\nsuch as (i) location, (ii) motion,\
    \ (iii) temperature and (iv) animal behavior, collars and\near-tags can show (i)\
    \ the areas of the farm that have been most frequently occupied and (ii)\nthe\
    \ history of the areas where the animals have been grazing. As a result, MiFarm-CSA\n\
    architecture is able to boost feed efﬁciency, increase food quality, mitigate\
    \ risks regarding\nthe animal loss, decrease the stakeholder’s expenses and increase\
    \ his income.\nSince the beginning of the development of new generations of UAVs,\
    \ these platforms\nwere considered a well suited tool, under different conﬁgurations,\
    \ in agriculture, livestock\nand forestry because of their potential (size, weight,\
    \ ﬂight speed and altitude) [81]. ASSM\nprovides a sophisticated technology by\
    \ deploying single UAVs or groups of UAVs (FANETs)\nfor implementing several monitoring\
    \ and surveillance activities in the crops, livestock and\nTelecom 2021, 2\n61\n\
    forests [82]. The UAVs can be equipped with (i) multispectral sensors, (ii) hyperspectral\n\
    sensors, (iii) thermal sensors, (iv) cameras and (v) GPS. The information is gathered\
    \ by\nscanning crops, livestock and forest landscapes. In particular, by scanning\
    \ the crops,\nASSM will acquire (i) soil and ﬁeld analysis, (ii) crop monitoring,\
    \ (iii) yield estimation\n(iv) bidirectional reﬂectance properties of plant surfaces,\
    \ (v) health of plants (leaf area\nindex, chlorophyll content, water stress detection,\
    \ photosynthesis soil analysis) and (vi)\nsoil composition in agricultural ﬁelds\
    \ to estimate crop yields based on the computation of\nvegetation indices in farmlands\
    \ [83]. By scanning livestock, ASSM will be able to gather\ninformation related\
    \ to (i) counting animals; (ii) locations of animals; (iii) animal temperature;\n\
    (iv) body condition scoring; (v) number of newly born animals; (vi) disease detection\
    \ and\nanimal identiﬁcation using radio frequency identiﬁcation (RFID). Lastly,\
    \ ASSM will be\ncapable of monitoring forests in terms of (i) carbon sequestration,\
    \ (ii) tree canopy analysis,\n(iii) conservation features, (iv) monitoring biodiversity,\
    \ (v) ecological landscape features\nand (vi) plant and tree health. As a result,\
    \ ASSM constitutes a powerful information\ngathering tool, which offers advanced,\
    \ real-time data collection and measurements tool,\nwhile expanding the monitored\
    \ landscape, thereby allowing the development of MFS in\nrough areas. ASSM is\
    \ expected to contribute to the resilience increase through instant\nmacroscopic\
    \ data gathering which enhances decision making, while reducing the cost\n(labor\
    \ cost and data acquiring) of current solutions, e.g., ground surveying. Furthermore,\n\
    based on technological advances such as edge computing, the ASSM can incorporate\n\
    on-board, real-time video analyzers which enable the autonomous and dynamic ﬂight\n\
    control of UAV according to the results of video surveillance output. As a result,\
    \ the time\nneeded for scanning an area will be highly reduced, allowing MiFarm-CSA\
    \ to expand the\nscalability of the monitored landscape.\nWCCF can further extend\
    \ the information provided to the MFS by including satellite,\nmeteorological\
    \ and climate-related information. Satellite-derived measurements are es-\nsential\
    \ inputs to monitor water management and agricultural production for improving\n\
    regional food security [84]. Observations coming from near real-time satellites\
    \ can be used\nto mitigate the adverse impacts of extreme events and promote climate\
    \ resilience.\nMiFarm-CSA architecure can beneﬁt from energy harvesting techniques\
    \ in the op-\neration of SST to reduce the environmental impact of farming. The\
    \ optimal “energy\nmanagement” policy can be deﬁned based on existing machine\
    \ learning (ML) models and\nAI algorithms [85].\nConsidering data storage and\
    \ transfer, middleware software and the necessary hard-\nware gateways and actuators\
    \ are needed for storing and forwarding the captured data.\nThe SMG component\
    \ provides the necessary middleware software and gateway infras-\ntructure to\
    \ support IDCON by gathering all kinds of information from different sources.\n\
    The middleware should able to abstract the heterogeneity and complexity of the\
    \ under-\nlying hardware devices, appliances or unmanned vehicles (data transmission\
    \ formats,\nmanufacturer particular features, operating systems, etc.) and to\
    \ provide inter-operability\namong sensors, robots and smart devices. Reliability\
    \ in communications, real-time data\ndistribution, automatic discovery of entities\
    \ and quality of service (QoS) monitoring is\nguaranteed by the middleware itself.\n\
    The CEDA component provides the data collection and processing system that is\n\
    carried through into distributed computing systems and clusters for real-time\
    \ processing.\nTo this end, robust data analytics, high performance computing,\
    \ efﬁcient data network\nmanagement and cloud computing (CC) techniques are used\
    \ [86]. More speciﬁcally, the\nmain pillars are (i) the integration of data that\
    \ originate from different sources via a\ncommon communication point, and (ii)\
    \ the provision of suitable adaptive algorithms for\neffective, dynamic and autonomous\
    \ decision-making. Taking into account the massive and\nheterogeneous characteristics\
    \ of data, acquiring and processing all of it is inefﬁcient in terms\nof communication\
    \ cost, computing complexity and the utilization of data storage resources.\n\
    For this reason, dimensionality reduction should provide a reduced version (sketch)\
    \ of\noriginal data taking into account the speciﬁc characteristics of the data\
    \ generated.\nTelecom 2021, 2\n62\nThe Panoptis platform consists of hardware\
    \ add-ons (collars and ear-tags) and soft-\nware modules that provide tools to\
    \ livestock farmers so as to locate and monitor livestock.\nThe platform allows\
    \ one to generate many types of enclosures, sub-areas and points of\ninterest.\
    \ This allows one to have records and monitoring of animal behavior in these enclo-\n\
    sures. The challenge in this component lies in the integration of information\
    \ when received\nfrom different sources: (a) IoT devices mounted on animals; (b)\
    \ satellite information about\npastures; (c) weather forecast; (d) soil sensors,\
    \ in a DSS to improve grazing management.\nThe interconnection between the data\
    \ collecting and the data storing can be achieved\nthrough low power wide area\
    \ networks (LPWAN) such as LoRA and Sigfox telecom-\nmunication networks. LoRa\
    \ and Sigfox protocols are widely used for supporting smart\napplications and\
    \ monitoring systems [87].\n3.2. Evidence-Based Assessment Methodology\nEVAM is\
    \ deﬁned as a major pillar of the proposed architecture, for fostering the\ninvolvement\
    \ of end-users in the MFS landscape, consisting of the following components:\n\
    (a) (SCOPE) methodology, (b) the SLO concept, (c) the behavioral decision-making\
    \ (BDm)\nand (d) the Behavioral Intervention Engine (BIE).\nOftentimes in technology,\
    \ development projects the social, behavioral and even hu-\nman aspects of the\
    \ technology play a secondary role to the technological aspects. The\nproposed\
    \ architecture intends to use innovative human factor approaches and method-\n\
    ologies to champion social and behavioral aspects and to prioritize the role of\
    \ the human\nin the development of technology. Doing so will ensure that the implementation\
    \ will not\nencounter barriers relating to user acceptance, usability and other\
    \ human barriers. The\nstarting point involves reﬁning new methods for modeling\
    \ the socio-technical aspects\nof farming systems and to examine the social and\
    \ behavioral aspects of mixed farming\nand agroforestry. The SCOPE methodology\
    \ examines and creates dynamic process maps\nfocusing on three interlocking and\
    \ interdependent levels of analysis: (i) process function-\nality (operational\
    \ processes); (ii) social cohesion (trust and social networks); and (iii) the\n\
    mediation of (i) and (ii) through collective knowledge and information cycles\
    \ [88].\nA further element of this layer is the SLO concept. This concept relates\
    \ to the continued\nacceptance of a set of business practices or operating procedures\
    \ by a company’s employees,\nstakeholders and the general public. The concept\
    \ of social license is closely related to the\nconcept of resilience and sustainability,\
    \ and the work to deﬁne and develop the SLO in this\narchitecture will ensure\
    \ that the technical innovations can be supported by sustained social\nand behavioral\
    \ change.\nAccording to many MFS experts, the problems of the end users, mostly\
    \ farmers,\nare not just about knowledge: it is about building the habit of cooperating.\
    \ Over the\nlast few decades, researchers have increasingly studied the factors\
    \ that inﬂuence farmers’\nadoption of environmentally sustainable practices [89].\
    \ Previous academic attempts to\ntake stock of the factors inﬂuencing farmers’\
    \ adoption of sustainable practices [90] did\nnot speciﬁcally focus on the roles\
    \ of behavioral factors, often resulting in an incomplete\noverview and limited\
    \ theoretical understanding of how and why these factors affect\ndecision-making.\
    \ There have been some efforts in policy circles to make an inventory\nof behavioral\
    \ factors inﬂuencing farmers’ adoption of sustainable practices, but their\ndisciplinary\
    \ scope was restricted to behavioral economics and communication sciences [91].\n\
    For this reason, MiFarm-CSA architecture introduces BDm which adopts the experimental\n\
    research concept combined with laboratory experiments in parallel. The innovation\
    \ of this\nconcept lies in the following twofold statement: (a) it evaluates ex-ante\
    \ farmers’ choices\nwhen they are faced with voluntary versus mandatory schemes\
    \ and with results based or\ncollective schemes, and (b) it includes experiments\
    \ in the ﬁeld, which are carried out to\ninform agricultural policies by including\
    \ a behavioral component, as the outcome variable\ngenerally consists of decisions\
    \ made by farmers [92,93]. To take a positive step forward,\nthe proposed architecture\
    \ is built on top of BDm the BIE. The latter aims at: (a) predicting\nthe expected\
    \ MFS-related behavior (behavioral intentions) of farmers on the basis of a\n\
    Telecom 2021, 2\n63\nset of socio-economic factors, (b) facilitating the selection\
    \ and application of appropriate\nstrategies through a number of communication\
    \ tools and channels and (c) driving the\ndesired MFS development widely. The\
    \ main operating elements of the BIE break down as\nfollows: farmers can be clustered\
    \ according to their (socio-demographic) proﬁles, and the\nsuitability of involvement\
    \ strategies is deﬁned both by the user proﬁle and by additional\nsocio-economic\
    \ factors (e.g., country culture). The resulting model will be used by the\nMiFarm-CSA\
    \ decision support system.\n3.3. The Social-Ecological Conceptual Framework\n\
    The lessons learnt and the experience of farmers stemming from the existing MFS\n\
    are of paramount importance for further development of MFS. The production of\
    \ more\nknowledge on MFS and the knowledge acquisition by farmers are both required\
    \ in order to\ndevelop sustainable, productive, viable and efﬁcient future MFS.\
    \ The SECF component of\nMiFarm-CSA architecture aims to foster core interactions\
    \ among animals, forests and crops,\nwhile mitigating the high complexity of these\
    \ interactions. SECF follows a participatory,\nlearning and technology-oriented\
    \ methodological approach based on knowledge-driven\ntools. This methodological\
    \ approach is deﬁned in ﬁve main pillars, namely, (a) the par-\nticipatory knowledge\
    \ building (PKB), (b) the mixed farming simulator (MFSim), (c) the\nexperimentally-oriented\
    \ co-design process (EC-P), (d) the peer learning network (PLN)\nand (e) decision-making\
    \ engine (D-ME).\nPKB involves the critical knowledge extraction, which encloses\
    \ the most important\nknowledge needed to support sustainable MFS. This knowledge\
    \ can be extracted from\nmeetings, seminars and workshops and recent literature\
    \ ﬁndings. The contributions of\ninternational experts who will analyze and evaluate\
    \ the current knowledge and remaining\nuncertainties about large-scale, commercial\
    \ MFS are crucial. The PLN pillar encourages\ntechnical and organizational innovation;\
    \ it enhances learning options, while reducing the\nisolated position of this\
    \ kind of system in a specialized world. The PLN could address\nMFS, by (a) identifying\
    \ learning issues, (b) supporting the exchange of (tacit) knowledge\nwithin the\
    \ network and (c) organizing access to relevant sources of knowledge outside the\n\
    peer network. The ﬁnal step of the PKB is related to the knowledge-exchange beyond\
    \ the\nPLN. The PLN ensures knowledge exchange among peers; e.g., it could also\
    \ be valuable\nthat experienced farmers and stakeholders organize access for other\
    \ actors (advisors,\nresearch and policy makers) who are interested in MFS. Field\
    \ visits, thematic networks and\ntechnological demonstrations constitute an immersive\
    \ type of learning which can enhance\nsigniﬁcantly the process of knowledge exchange.\n\
    The participatory knowledge building can be enriched with state-of-the-art technolo-\n\
    gies like virtual and augmented reality. Such technology could maximize the participants’\n\
    engagement in the training material, by fostering the motivation of end users\
    \ to be engaged\nto the PKB and the SECF activities in general.\nThe MFSim is\
    \ also introduced as another major pillar of SECF in order to mitigate\nthe complexity\
    \ of MFS. Recent trends in broader collaboration across institutions, across\n\
    disciplines and between the public and private sectors suggest that the stage\
    \ is set for the\nmajor advances in agricultural systems science that are needed\
    \ for the next generation of\nmodels, databases, knowledge products and decision\
    \ support systems [49,94]. Specialized\nsimulation modeling of crop–livestock\
    \ integration among farms is the basis for achieving\nthe up-scaling process involved\
    \ in integrating beyond the farm level. Furthermore, com-\nputer simulation with\
    \ environmental-economic models at the farm level provide a useful\ntool for integrating\
    \ knowledge and information to predict production efﬁciency, environ-\nmental\
    \ impacts and the effects of management policies on production performance [95].\n\
    The MFSim is introduced as the main modeling and simulation tool of designing,\
    \ testing,\nvalidating and evaluating mixed farming modeling systems and complex\
    \ simulation sce-\nnarios. The aim of MFSim lies in the fact that it allows farmers,\
    \ stakeholders and supply\nchain actors to experiment with diversiﬁed cropping,\
    \ animal and forest systems without\nhaving to invest or risk resources. MFSim\
    \ could also enable stakeholders to (a) model\nTelecom 2021, 2\n64\nand simulate\
    \ different variations of forest-crop-livestock integrated farms, (b) model and\n\
    simulate different use of resources (nutrients, land, manure management, etc.)\
    \ and (c)\nmodel and simulate manure management practices and animal feeding.\
    \ In particular,\nMFSim could provide signiﬁcant insights in (a) simulating livestock\
    \ performance, while\ngrazing grain crops, (b) assessing diversifying crop rotations\
    \ in terms of sale and animal\nfeeding sources, (c) studying and evaluating tactical\
    \ and strategic responses to improve\nthe performance of livestock feed systems,\
    \ (d) modeling and evaluating the implications\nof grazing crops on the livestock\
    \ system as a whole, (e) analyzing and evaluating the\nproduction and economic\
    \ risk mitigation beneﬁts that arise from operating a mix of crop\nand livestock\
    \ systems, (f) evaluating recycling tactics in animal manure to fertilize crops\n\
    and (g) simulating the integration of alternate crops in the crop rotations.\n\
    The EC-P is also introduced as a component of SECF, as its aim is to motivate\
    \ farmers\nto cooperate in the knowledge exchange processes without feeling loss\
    \ of freedom and\nindependence [96,97]. The EC-P engages farmers in laboratory\
    \ and ﬁeld experiments,\nby conducting trials and demonstrations together with\
    \ the experts. In particular, during\nlaboratory experiments, the stakeholders\
    \ and the researchers can work together and see\nhow the technology will be used\
    \ in practice.\n3.4. Mixed Farming as a Service\nThe MFaS is the fourth main pillar\
    \ of MiFarm-CSA whose aim is to deliver a rich suite\nof tools and services to\
    \ the end users (farmers, agricultural companies, decision makers,\nregulators,\
    \ supply chain actors, stakeholders and individuals) in three dimensions, namely,\n\
    (a) environmental, (b) economic and (c) social. MFaS goes beyond than a conventional\n\
    toolkit for farmers; it constitutes the main decision support system of the proposed\
    \ architec-\nture. MFaS serves as an integrated management software that helps\
    \ farmers and growers\nto establish sustainable farm management practices and\
    \ reach proﬁtable crop production,\nby enclosing various applications and services\
    \ related to conventional farming systems.\nThe envisioned MFaS should support\
    \ the following MFS applications and services: (a)\nthe Integrated Farming Systems\
    \ Economics (IFSEC), (b) the W-KES, (c) the APED, (d) the\nIntegrated Irrigation\
    \ and Fertilization Application (IIFA), (e) the NCSA, (f) the Resource\nManagers\
    \ (ReMa) and (g) the DiMaRa.\nIFSEC is a critical component of MFaS, as it provides\
    \ the decision-making compo-\nnent of the proposed architecture. IFSEC analyses\
    \ existing case-studies of well-managed\nMFS; develops a labor-balanced analysis\
    \ based on farm surveys; develops participative\napproaches with groups of farmers\
    \ to consider their management strategies and develop\nscenarios; and identiﬁes\
    \ management tools to assess MFS labor requirements and associ-\nated costs so\
    \ as to facilitate integration between farms. In particular, IFSEC should abe\n\
    considered as completed when it is in such position to provide (a) advanced logistics,\
    \ (b)\nadvanced ﬁnancial management, (c) MFS management and (d) MFS visualizations.\
    \ The\nIFSEC advanced logistics could include (i) labor management, (ii) machinery\
    \ management\nand (iii) inventory management. In general, the end user should\
    \ be able to register a farm\nby adding ﬁnancial information, work task assignment\
    \ per worker and cost per worker.\nAdditionally, economic features for machinery\
    \ can be included, i.e., cost per individual\ncategory task per hour or area unit.\
    \ Reservation for a machine for speciﬁc hours and inven-\ntory management could\
    \ be available as well. The IFSEC advanced ﬁnancial management\ncould include\
    \ the management of (i) sales, (ii) expenses, (iii) assets, (iv) loans, (v) budget\n\
    and (vi) transactions. The end user should be able to register sales invoices\
    \ containing\nmultiple items, while the corresponding quantity per item will automatically\
    \ stored to the\ndeﬁned warehouse. The IFSEC MFS management could involve: (i)\
    \ crop-livestock diversi-\nﬁcation per individual ﬁeld; (ii) week, month, year\
    \ and long-term forecasting, including\ntemperature, wind speed and rainfall (mm).\
    \ Information for pests, weeds and diseases\nwith detailed descriptions and a\
    \ list with active substances which ﬁght or prevent them\ncould be included as\
    \ well. The IFSEC MFS visualizations will bring new dashboards with\nreal-time\
    \ data with predeﬁned templates like usage, productivity, ﬁnances, Key Perfor-\n\
    Telecom 2021, 2\n65\nmance Indicators (KPIs) and ﬁeld analytics, while the MiFarm-CSA\
    \ engine will be featured\nto export a structured report in a user-friendly manner,\
    \ such as tasks, crop production,\nusage, ﬁnances, cost per task, inventory and\
    \ resources.\nThe W-KES applies a collaborative service to share knowledge, experiences\
    \ and\ninnovations among the different people involved in the design and application\
    \ of MFS\nagricultural systems. W-KES is composed by three components: (a) the\
    \ W-KES semantic\nmodel, (b) the W-KES web-based application and (c) W-KES forum.\
    \ The semantic model\nis organized in a set of triplets, “subject”, “predicate”\
    \ and “object” [98], and the triplets\nare interconnected. The main resources\
    \ of the W-KES semantic model are (a) web pages\ncreated in a collaborative manner,\
    \ (b) simulation results conducted by the MFSim, (c) best\npractices formed as\
    \ documents, stemming from the SECF and (d) educational material and\ntraining\
    \ modules coming from the PLN. These resources are associated with certain triplets;\n\
    for example, users can associate the triplet “wheat”, as “can be attacked by”:\
    \ “aphids” in a\nweb page presenting knowledge about wheat. Furthermore, the W-KES\
    \ intends to include\na knowledge search service, which allows users to query\
    \ web pages by keyword, string\nor sentence matching. For example, a user may\
    \ search for manure quality management\nfor MFS and the W-KES web-based application\
    \ will propose related web pages, material\ncontent from the PLN and best practices—extracted\
    \ from the SECF layer. Lastly, the W-KES\nweb-based application incorporates a\
    \ forum, which allows any user to share his opinion; or\nask the community about\
    \ information or a new topic that he cannot ﬁnd in another source.\nThe innovation\
    \ behind this service lies in the fact that it can also enable direct and indirect\n\
    exchange of resources like feed and manure.\nBased on the information collected\
    \ by the IDCON, The APED and the IIFA are en-\nvisaged as smart services for in-ﬁeld\
    \ operations and data analysis. According to the\ncharacteristics of plant pathogens,\
    \ efﬁcient plant disease management requires a high\ndensity of spatial and temporal\
    \ information regarding the condition of any parameter\nrelated to the crop growth\
    \ [99]. Hyperspectral images combined with ground sensors can\nidentify host–pathogen\
    \ interactions at an early stage. This fact can simplify the complexity\nof the\
    \ identiﬁcation and the quantiﬁcation of different kinds of stress factors that\
    \ may result\nin crop anomalies [100]. Moreover, data mining techniques [101]\
    \ (ML methods like artiﬁcial\nneural networks or support vector machines (SVM))\
    \ can be leveraged since they have\nproved to be superior for distinguishing in\
    \ between more than one type of stress factors\nand different diseases [102].\
    \ The integration of ground sensor data provided by SST and\nimage data provided\
    \ by ASSM in combination with Geographic Information Systems (GIS)\nand data mining\
    \ techniques will constitute the core of APED services. IIFA services besides\n\
    the integration between ground sensor data provided by SST and image data provided\
    \ by\nASSM will also incorporate data from WCCF. This holistic integration of\
    \ drought-causative\ninformation (precipitation) and drought-responsive information\
    \ (vegetation condition,\ncrop anomaly) aim to develop specialized variations\
    \ of well known vegetation indexes\n(e.g., normalized difference vegetation index)\
    \ (i) for superior drought monitoring and (ii)\nfor early indication of any decrease\
    \ in crop production associated with drought or lack of\nnutrients [103].\nA dashboard\
    \ will be the human–machine interface for delivering the information com-\ning\
    \ from the WCCF, and to make suggestions and recommendations based on the captured\n\
    satellite, meteorological and climate-related information. Concurrently, the dashboard\n\
    could also digest the information stemming from the meteorological stations, which\
    \ are\ninstalled at the ﬁeld, in order to provide short-term predictions and suggestions.\n\
    Recent political priorities in Europe aim to rationalize agricultural production,\
    \ reduce\npollution, upgrade the environment, maintain rural infrastructures and\
    \ meet new societal\nconcerns, such as product quality and animal welfare. For\
    \ example, soil testing has been\nproven to be a valuable tool for evaluating\
    \ the available nutrient status of soil. The soil\ninvestigation is exceptionally\
    \ useful for cultivators to discover which sort of harvests to\nbe developed in\
    \ a speciﬁc soil condition and helps to determine the proper amount of\nnutrients\
    \ to be added to a given soil based on its fertility and crop needs. The intensiﬁcation\n\
    Telecom 2021, 2\n66\nof livestock operations in the last few decades has resulted\
    \ in increased social concern over\nthe environmental impacts of livestock operations,\
    \ and thus making appropriate manure\nmanagement decisions is increasingly important.\
    \ Animal manure is a valuable resource\nif handled responsibly but a source of\
    \ serious challenges and public health concerns\nif managed inappropriately. Risks\
    \ associated with animal manure handling could be\nrelated to soil, water and\
    \ air quality. A socially acceptable manure management system\nthat simultaneously\
    \ achieves the pressing environmental objectives while balancing the\nsocio-economic\
    \ welfare of farmers and society at large is needed. Manure management\ndecisions\
    \ involve a number of decision makers with different and conﬂicting views of\n\
    what is acceptable in the context of sustainable development. In order to ensure\
    \ that\nthe proposed schema is complete, this kind of resource management can\
    \ not be ignored.\nFor this reason, MiFarm-CSA introduces ReMA includes a series\
    \ of resource managers to\nprovide the optimal and accurate resource allocation:\n\
    •\nThe Soil Manager (SOMA) aims provide optimal decisions, recommendations and\n\
    case studies on how the soil quality will be maximized. While each of these decisions,\n\
    recommendations and case studies represent possible techniques to effectively\
    \ manage\nsoil resources, each practice will be adequately assessed to identify\
    \ possible constraints\nor drawbacks.\n•\nThe Manure Manager (MAMA) aims to provide\
    \ optimal decisions, recommenda-\ntions and case studies on the manure management\
    \ in Mixed Farming Systems. The\nutilization of livestock manure to add nutrients\
    \ back to the soil is one of the key crop-\nlivestock interactions in MFS. Manure\
    \ when used as a soil amendment can beneﬁt the\nsoil, resulting in crop production\
    \ and resilience beneﬁts for smallholders via increased\nnutrient supply to crops\
    \ and improved soil structure and water holding capacity.\nManure has well-documented\
    \ impacts on soil chemical and physical properties.\n•\nThe Water Manager (WAMA)\
    \ will be able to make optimal decisions on the water\nmanagement on the MFS.\
    \ Improving water use efﬁciency and water management\non mixed farms is arguably\
    \ the most important and high potential improvement\nfor farmers to be climate-smart.\
    \ Optimal water management strategies increase net\nreturns and purchasing power\
    \ parity of households much more than any other and\nperhaps presents the only\
    \ viable pathway to help transition smallholder farmers out\nof poverty.\nDue\
    \ to the withdrawal of market intervention policies, market volatility has increased,\n\
    causing high income risk for specialized farms. Given that both global agricultural\
    \ markets\nand agricultural policies enhanced efﬁciency in producing more of a\
    \ same product, e.g.,\nfavouring economies of scale through intensiﬁcation, enlargement\
    \ and specialization,\nDiMaRa’s goal is to assist MFS to have the ﬂexibility to\
    \ face uncertain climate and market\nconditions. As a service, the DiMaRa should\
    \ be able to gather market-oriented data from\nseveral sources, while compiling\
    \ it using big data analytics for transforming it to knowledge\nand recommendations.\
    \ The purpose of DiMaRa lies in three axes:\n•\nAggregate accurate and timely\
    \ climate and market information (weather, demand,\nsupply and prices);\n•\nProcess\
    \ and analyze it in a way such that it will be transformed into usable knowledge\n\
    (intelligence) using big data analytics;\n•\nDisseminate it to mixed farming stakeholders\
    \ through web and mobile applications.\nData aggregation could encompass (i) data\
    \ from WCCF, (ii) information about the\nprices of commodities which are directly\
    \ or indirectly related to mixed farming ecosys-\ntems [104], (iii) data from\
    \ Agriculture Market Information Services (AMIS), which consti-\ntute another\
    \ source of interest with rich agriculture-related data [105] and (iv) data coming\n\
    from Google marketing tools such as Google Trends and Google Keyword Tool, which\
    \ will\nbe utilized to capture near-real time data for trends in the ﬁeld of agriculture.\n\

    4. The Expected Beneﬁts of Mifarm-CSA Architecture\nCSA addresses the challenges\
    \ which climate change poses to agricultural production.\nMiFarm-CSA constitutes\
    \ an efﬁcient CSA-driven architecture which forms a user-oriented,\nsocial-aware\
    \ and ecological platform, deployed as a service. Its main beneﬁts are outlined\n\
    as follows:\n•\nIncreasing agricultural productivity and income while also enhancing\
    \ resilience or\nadaptation of livelihoods and ecosystems towards climate extremes.\
    \ Through the\nIDCON, SECF and MFaS layers, the proposed architecture exploits\
    \ multi-disciplinary,\non-ﬁeld and off-ﬁeld data, to train the novel DSS, thereby\
    \ enabling it to make optimal\ndecisions, which are expected to boost MFS productivity\
    \ and stakeholders’ incomes.\nMoreover, through DiMaRa, MiFarm-CSA is anticipated\
    \ to provide MFS the ﬂexibility\nto face uncertain climate and market conditions.\n\
    •\nIncreasing synergies among different farming systems by adopting new data collection\n\
    and monitoring technologies, such as smart sensors, robots, UAVs, advanced tracking\n\
    systems, long-range IoT-enabled sensors, middleware and gateways. The IDCON\n\
    layer provides the cutting-edge technologies for applications in MFS: IoT sensors,\n\
    devices, modern UAVs and FANETs, which aspire to be fully autonomous and multi-\n\
    collective, supporting, advanced processing and integration functionalities and\
    \ are\ncapable of covering large-scale areas for providing big volumes of data\
    \ in near real\ntime. The autonomy is twofold: the energy autonomy will be accomplished\
    \ by\nTelecom 2021, 2\n68\ndeploying energy harvesting techniques for recharging\
    \ sensors and UAVs and by\ndeﬁning a pilot-sensitive energy-budget approach for\
    \ each data collection technology.\n•\nSpeeding up the establishment of a community\
    \ of practice and dynamic methodology\nin designing, developing and evaluating\
    \ mixed and integrated farming systems.\nMiFarm-CSA adopts innovative human factor\
    \ approaches and methodologies to\nchampion social and behavioral aspects and\
    \ to prioritize the role of the human in the\ntechnological development. By exploiting\
    \ SCOPE in the proposed architecture, the\naim is to facilitate a comparison between\
    \ the current ways in which mixed farming\nand agroforestry are conducted and\
    \ future ways which better account for the socio-\ntechnical system as described\
    \ by SCOPE. This whole approach enables MiFarm-CSA\nto assess the inadequacies\
    \ of the current treatment of social and behavioral issues\nand ensure that the\
    \ emerged outcomes are built around the identiﬁed social and\nbehavioral aspects\
    \ of mixed farming and agroforestry. CoP will involve a multi-actor\nand trans-disciplinary\
    \ group of end users. SLO relates to the continued acceptance\nof a set of business\
    \ practices or operating procedures by a stakeholders. Moreover,\nSLO ensures\
    \ that the technical innovations can be supported by sustained social and\nbehavioral\
    \ change.\n•\nForming a basis for the creation of a conceptual framework to analyze\
    \ crop-livestock\nintegration by fostering core interactions among animals, grasslands\
    \ and crops, de-\nveloping metabolic analysis of material ﬂows, devising a biodiversity\
    \ approach for\nthe development of integrated crop-livestock systems and promoting\
    \ social resources\nand stakeholder interactions.\n•\nPrescribing a rich suite\
    \ of user-friendly MFS applications and services for fostering the\noptimal combination\
    \ of production, accurate climate change estimations and optimal\ndecisions on\
    \ local and national levels.\n5. Case Study\nThe proposed architecture envisages\
    \ upgrading, in terms of sustainability, areas where\ndifferent agricultural systems,\
    \ such as crops, livestock and forestry, coexist. For the purpose\nof the paper,\
    \ a case study was considered in the area of the Western Macedonia, Greece for\n\
    evaluating the components of MiFarm-CSA architecture.\nThe area of interest is\
    \ located in a region of Western Macedonia in Greece, called\nGrevena. It is a\
    \ mountainous area which is surrounded by a forest and includes a wide\nvariety\
    \ of ﬂora, including fruit trees, grapevine, berries and vegetables. Nearby the\
    \ forest,\nthere is rich livestock activity by local farmers. The main challenges\
    \ raised in this area are\nsummarized as follows:\n•\nClimate change has affected\
    \ the biodiversity of the area, having negative impacts on\nthe yield production\
    \ and the soil quality.\n•\nHigh operational and labor costs (energy needs, animal\
    \ feeding) add a lot of pressure\nto farming businesses.\n•\nThe extensive use\
    \ of chemical inputs (fertilizers and pesticides) has negatively affected\nthe\
    \ water cycle.\n•\nThe animal waste management is not sufﬁcient, leading to negative\
    \ environmental\neffects and waste of resources.\n•\nThe lack of forestry woodland\
    \ management results in high risks of things such as\nwildﬁres.\n•\nLow cooperation\
    \ between local farming businesses due to a poor local market.\n•\nA wide skill\
    \ gap between each kind of system, deteriorating the objective of collabora-\n\
    tion considerably.\n•\nTechnological deﬁciencies, as farmers are not aware of\
    \ modern monitoring and surveil-\nlance methods to reduce their labor costs.\n\
    •\nAbsence of local professional groups in MFS rules out the possibility of combining\n\
    local agricultural and livestock practices.\nTelecom 2021, 2\n69\nThese challenges\
    \ hinder the local farmers and stakeholders from further extending and\nutilizing\
    \ their resources. In addition, farmers and stakeholders are quite skeptical towards\n\
    changing—and therefore increasing their proﬁts and sustainability—to a collaborative\n\
    farming scheme such as MFS.\nWithin MiFarm-CSA, the cooperation between the forest,\
    \ the local farms and the\nlocal stakeholders will be fostered by applying the\
    \ EVAM methodology in integrating\nsustainable agriculture, livestock and forestry\
    \ combinations. The rationale behind this lies\nin products’ attractiveness (high\
    \ nutritionally valuable products, longer shelf life of dairy\nproducts), Protected\
    \ Designation of Origin (PDO) products and livestock welfare (animal\nimmunological\
    \ status enhancement and efﬁcient animal breeding systems). Through the\nIDCON\
    \ layer a variety of combinations of mixed farming solutions will be monitored,\n\
    resulting in providing valuable data that can be further analyzed to reveal interesting\n\
    correlations that would be impossible to discover otherwise. Moreover, MiFarm-CSA\n\
    using SECF and MFaS, is expected to reduce the environmental footprint of the\
    \ system,\ndecrease input and management costs and increase the system’s overall\
    \ productivity. In\ndetail, it is expected to contribute to the decrease of atmospheric\
    \ CO2 pollution and to\nthe mitigation of global warming, through the carbon sequestration\
    \ process. In order\nto achieve it, the proposed architecture will exploit forestry\
    \ and managed woodland\nin-between the cultivation and grazing lands and the livestock\
    \ wastes so as to increase\ncarbon sequestration. Moreover, an additional increase\
    \ of the total volume of woodland\nbiomass will further increase the carbon sequestration.\
    \ Furthermore, weed management\ncost is expected to decrease with the use of animal\
    \ grazing, which leads to a reduction\nof machine hours required as an indirect\
    \ measurement of fossil fuel consumption, and\nthe use of mulched woodland material\
    \ can decrease the evaporation of soil water and\nconsequently reduce the irrigation\
    \ water volume. Last but not least, the animal waste usage\nin crop cultivation\
    \ will increase its quality, decrease use of chemicals and also decrease\ntransportation\
    \ costs. Through SECF and MFaS, the mixed treatments will aim to rationalize\n\
    agricultural production; reduce pollution and protect the environment; maintain\
    \ rural\ninfrastructure; and meet emerging social concerns, such as product quality\
    \ and animal\nwelfare. Besides the increases in animal feed supply and system\
    \ productivity, which lead,\non the one hand to income increase, and on the other\
    \ hand to decreases in operational\ncosts, a positive side-effect of this collaboration\
    \ is that job opportunities are expected to\nincrease, since more disciplines\
    \ will be required to handle the system’s complexity.\n6. Conclusions\nThe food\
    \ supply chain is a key strategic sector globally, from both economic and labor\n\
    perspectives. This sector is also critical to meet the great societal challenges\
    \ of sustainable\nfarming, food security, food safety and healthy nutrition, now\
    \ and in the future, which\nconstitute without a doubt the most important priorities\
    \ for both citizens and policy makers.\nNevertheless, agriculture is at a crossroads\
    \ on a global level. The increasing digitalization\nof agricultural practices\
    \ makes it possible to produce plant and animal products with ever\nhigher efﬁciency\
    \ and ever lower environmental impact. Therefore, the agri-food sector\nis expected\
    \ to become more and more data-driven by the use of ICT, while the need for\n\
    AgTech-enabled innovation will become greater than ever. A number of technologies\n\
    not traditionally used in the agri-food sector are now starting to play a key\
    \ role in what\nis perceived as an AgTech revolution. Automation, artiﬁcial intelligence,\
    \ drones, big\ndata and cloud analytics offer us the opportunity to further our\
    \ mastery of agriculture.\nThe Industrial Revolution 4.0 is expected to generate\
    \ disruptive changes in agricultural\npractices and pave the way for new innovative\
    \ ideas that aspire to obtain market share\nfrom a billion dollar market. This\
    \ ICT-revolution is expected to further advance and evolve\nsmart farming/smart\
    \ agriculture, including CSA and precision agriculture.\nIn this work, a multi-actor\
    \ architecture introduced as a reference for the innovative\nconcept of CSA was\
    \ applied in integrated agricultural systems, such as MFS. The proposed\narchitecture\
    \ aims at providing a CSA-based, multi-actor and community-oriented architec-\n\
    Telecom 2021, 2\n70\nture, enhanced with models, tools, frameworks and cutting-edge\
    \ solutions, for advancing\nthe current farming system to a smart, resilient and\
    \ integrated/mixed farming ecosystem,\naiming at increasing the resilience of\
    \ the underlying farms, crops, livestock and forestry\nagainst the negative impacts\
    \ of the climate change. The next step of this work is to conduct\na qualitative\
    \ and quantitative analysis of the performance of the proposed architecture in\n\
    the two pilots, based on speciﬁc KPIs.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization,\

  limitations: The review's limitations lie in its narrow focus on automated irrigation
    management systems, excluding other components of precision agriculture and broader
    implications for sustainable farming practices. Additionally, the review does
    not provide a comparative analysis of different automated irrigation management
    systems or specific recommendations for their implementation.

    Get rights and content Abstract Precision farming makes use of information technologies
    in agriculture. With the satellite positioning system and electronic communication
    standards, position and time may be integrated into all procedures connected to
    farming. Today, precision farming is primarily geared towards site-specific application
    of fertilisers with the resulting cost advantages being quite small. Thus, precision
    farming will likely gain in importance only when viable additional benefits, such
    as reduced environmental burdens and increased flow of information, are recognised
    and evaluated and become part of the reward itself. Previous article in issue

    impactVirtual land consolidation 1. Introduction At the close of the 20th century,
    ‘precision farming’ has evolved into a current research topic all over the world.
    Today, most agricultural disciplines participate in this effort, encouraging progress
    in agricultural technology, which originally supplied the impetus through the
    integration of information technology into tractors, machines and implements.
    Interestingly enough, however, ‘precision farming’ is almost always associated
    with site-specific fertilisation. Expectations of farmers using the new technology
    are usually twofold — a decrease in fertiliser required for the same yield and/or
    higher yields with the use of the same amounts of fertiliser. Plant protection
    is secondary. Recently, there have also been demands for site-specific seeding.
    Yet, does ‘precision farming’ not really go beyond such concerns? Does it not
    mean extensive changes in every aspect of land cultivation, inside and outside,
    as well as with respect to tillage and livestock breeding? And, finally, does
    this approach not also influence forestry and horticulture? In other words, is
    it not rather the case that precision farming is the point of departure for a
    revised use of available land per se, a framework in which operation and herd
    sizes, wooded lots or horticultural acreages take second place to the central
    concerns of the environment, its variability and heterogeneity? 2. GPS as a supplier
    of position and time At the end of the 1980s, the ‘global positioning systems’
    (GPS), NAVSTAR-GPS and GLONASS, introduced a new era. For the military, positioning
    and time became available at any time and place. Both kinds of information could
    also be used for civilian purposes, even if the accuracy obtained was somewhat
    diminished. Today, civilian users of GPS may well be in the majority, when viewed
    world-wide. In North America and Europe, reference services provide positional
    accuracy of 1–5 m on-the-go. More advanced devices even reach decimetre accuracy,
    allowing for exact navigation or even automated navigation of vehicles. After
    switching SA off on May 2, 2000, NAVSTAR-GPS will fulfil positioning without differential
    services. Another improvement will be available with the transition of GPS to
    the next satellite generation and the European satellite navigation system Galileo
    which is likely to be implemented. Therefore, GPS is, and in the future will also
    be, a ‘technology available to everyone’. In agriculture, the possibilities for
    application will be seen in positioning and navigation (Fig. 1). Download : Download

    communication In Germany, the development and establishment of satellite-supported
    positioning and navigation happened almost simultaneously with the evolution of
    a standardised electronic communication system for agricultural purposes. After
    an 11-year standardisation effort, the ‘Landwirtschaftliches BUS-System’ (LBS)
    is now available to farmers in a large number of actual devices and implements.
    This allows for communication between tractors, implements and farm management
    systems geared towards the needs of European agriculture and its small-scale operations
    (Fig. 2). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. The ‘Landwirtschaftliches
    BUS-System (LBS)’ according to DIN 9684/2–5. At the same time, LBS functions as
    a basis for the international standards organisation (ISO) 11783 standardisation
    procedure. Here, with LBS and ISO data structures largely identical, direct integration
    of the tractor has been achieved, also taking into account larger tractor-implement
    units in North America and some parts of Europe. Both systems may be operated
    within one communication network. With identical physical components and data
    structure as well as an identically structured virtual terminal, software updates
    from LBS to ISO cause few problems. 4. Precision farming today With GPS and LBS
    (ISO 11783), both essential technologies for precision farming are now available.
    In response to demand, two different implementation strategies for fertilisation
    are now in use (Fig. 3). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Systematic
    approaches for the implementation of site-specific fertilisation. 4.1. The mapping
    approach The mapping approach is based on historical data about yield distribution
    and availability of plant nutrients in the soil. Both pieces of information can
    be established in practice enough accurately. 4.1.1. Yield measurements in the
    combine harvester Yield measurements in the combine harvester are state of the
    art technology. The mean error (calibration error) is less than 1%, the distribution
    of data for individual grain elevator loads shows a standard deviation of 3%.
    Under laboratory conditions, more significant differences in precision were found
    between different measuring principles, depending on the type of grain, flow capacity
    and gradient of the machine. 4.1.2. Soil sampling For soil sampling, certain standard
    procedures have evolved. Mixed sample for large sites taken from mapped positions
    (map unit size=1 ha, field size defined by driving around the field, mathematical
    map defined with an on-board computer, target navigation, taking of individual
    samples around sampling position for one mixed sample per designated map position).
    Mixed samples from yield zones with site yield history (sampling positions limited
    to three (maximum five) yield zones, mathematical sample positioning with the
    PC, relative assignment of sampling chart by means of driving around the field,
    target navigation, taking of individual samples around sampling position for one
    mixed sample per designated yield zone). Geo-referenced individual samples with
    yield information missing (limited to certain sampling sites, field size determined
    by driving around the field, minimum number of sampling positions mathematically
    defined, target navigation, individual samples taken with geo-referencing — possibly
    as a mixed sample around sampling position). Permanent navigational sampling positions
    for basic fertilisation in closed ‘precision farming’ systems with fertilisation
    to nutrient removal (one-time definition of permanent sampling positions, relative
    assignment of sampling chart by means of driving around the field, target navigation,
    individual samples taken with geo-positioning). This information allows for a
    one-time decision regarding phosphorus and potassium requirements for future vegetation.
    It also facilitates an estimate of the most suitable plant density subject to
    yield and soil specifics. This approach is useful for production under certain
    conditions, at stable weather conditions within the vegetation period, with a
    known deficit in the availability of nutrients phosphorus and potassium, and ignoring
    nitrogen top fertilisation for high yields. 4.2. Sensor approach Historical data
    are not enough if high yields are based on nitrogen fertilisation, livestock breeding
    ensures adequate nutrient supply with P and K, and the weather is subject to great
    changes. For such conditions, the sensor approach monitors actual growth conditions
    over time. To do this, plant chlorophyll reflectance is a very useful measurement
    because it correlates closely with nitrogen content of the plant and with resulting
    plant mass. At the same time, reflectance in the near infrared area is distinguishable
    easily from surrounding plant matter and soil. In combination with type-specific
    growth functions for individual plants, growth deficits may be detected and remedied
    by real-time application of nitrogen-fertilisers. Several studies have illustrated
    the efficiency of this approach, showing overall yield increases and more uniform
    yield distributions. 4.3. Plant protection For site-specific plant protection
    measures, mapping and sensor approaches have been developed in close analogy to
    fertilisation (Fig. 4). However, in practice, both approaches have been put to
    very limited use. The reasons are several. First, manual mapping is extremely
    labour-intensive as very limited technical support is available. Second, the accuracy
    of remote data collection is still unsatisfactory. It is not yet possible to analyse
    and interpret information thus obtained, automatically, or not with acceptable
    precision. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Systematic approaches for
    site-specific plant protection. Third, sensor approaches that collect data about
    spacing do not allow for plant-specific application. Fourth, image analysis approaches
    are still thwarted by extensive computation requirements in order to apply them
    to advanced direct injection systems. 5. Precision farming tomorrow In light of
    the technical possibilities of information technology that are available, the
    current use of precision farming must, at best, be called ‘modest’. Apart from
    economic concerns, three other reasons may be cited which are described below.
    5.1. The nitrogen and water problem With respect to fertilisation, the problems
    lie in plant-specific application of nitrogen taking into account the soil water
    available to the plant. Several improvements are needed. 5.1.1. Sensor approach
    with map overlay Existing sensor approaches always over fertilise poor growth
    sites, without taking into account local limitations of soil type and water supply.
    Such excess additions of nitrogen not tailored to crop needs might lead to ground
    water contamination. To avoid this, the sensor approach needs to be complemented
    by additional no-contact sensors for the acquisition of data about water stress
    in the plants, soil water available to the plants, and nitrogen available in the
    soil. Moreover, better models, that incorporate N requirements of individual cultures
    and types of plants, need to be developed, including information about the actual
    growth patterns of the crop as a whole or in the region (aerial photographs, satellite
    imagery), and local limitations from mapping information. 5.1.2. Equal spacing
    of plants Whereas in most cases, nitrogen may be applied and tailored to plant
    requirements without problems and at low cost, the delimiting factor in many regions
    around the globe is available soil water. Thus, precision farming must pay closer
    attention to this problem while thoroughly re-evaluating traditional cultivation
    systems. There is a dire need for an investigation of whether even plant spacing
    could not use available resources more efficiently, especially with generously
    spaced row cultures such as corn and soybeans, (Fig. 5). Initial experiments have
    shown that such approaches result not only in higher yields but also in significantly
    more efficient soil water and nitrogen uses. Additional improvements might be
    obtained by site-specific plant density. Download : Download full-size image Fig.
    5. Equal spacing of corn for silage. 5.2. Structural problems Precision farming
    today aims at heterogeneities within a crop, attempting to take into account the
    requirements (and environment). Thus, this agricultural system is geared toward
    large-scale farming, increasing its existing production advantages (Fig. 6). Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 6. Systematic integration of precision farming
    into existing agricultural structures. Most regions around the globe are dominated
    by small-scale farming operations. Precision farming, in such regions, must take
    the reverse approach and create economically and ecologically sound operations
    by ‘virtual land consolidation’, while keeping ownership structures intact (Fig.
    7). Initial analyses of existing ‘transborder farming systems’ show a saving of
    15–25% in required headland, 20–30% in required work time, and 100–300 ϵ per ha
    in costs. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 7. Precision farming on the
    basis of ‘virtual land consolidation’. 5.3. Improvements in genetic engineering
    Along with improvements in plant performance characteristics, genetic engineering
    in agriculture is aimed mainly at improving resistance to disease. Results affect
    plant protection, reducing the need for intensive control efforts as in traditional
    cultivation systems. Significant implications are to be expected in the area of
    weed control, a leading concern with respect to overall effort and acreages affected.
    Thus, precision farming will have to meet new challenges found in precise application
    of minimal chemical amounts, accommodation for chemical bonding to the soil humus,
    and improving efficiency by integrating chemical applications with available soil
    water. Furthermore, because genetic engineering advances are expected to be more
    rapid than other technologies, such as plant identification systems, those latter
    technologies are likely to become subsumed and lose much of their importance.
    6. Environmental impact In light of extensive on-going research activities, development
    and implementation of precision farming around the globe is rather discouraging.
    Approximately 10% of the available agricultural land in the US Midwest benefits
    from yield mapping. In Europe, application of precision agriculture includes well-developed
    sites in UK, Eastern Germany and Denmark. The implementation of site-specific
    fertilisation measures, with data obtained from yield mapping, is even less. Site-specific
    plant protection measures are negligible. Naturally, this raises the question
    of whether precision farming in this form is really needed or if there are important
    reasons for such restrained use. 6.1. No uniform systems available Despite the
    completion of standardisation procedures, there are currently no uniform electronic
    communication systems available in agriculture. In Europe, LBS is used by a certain
    number of manufacturers. There are significant problems with respect to implementation
    caused by a lack of know-how on the manufacturers’ side and by different possible
    interpretations of the standards. For ISO 11783, the problems will even grow worse
    because the currently defined rate of data transfer represents an enormous bottleneck
    for a substantially increased information volume. Improvements in performance
    can only be obtained via fibre-optic cables which, in turn, lead to additional
    problems when used for mobile agricultural technology. The situation is aggravated
    by globalisation, i.e. the reduction of manufacturers to a handful of ‘global
    players,’ resulting from corporate mergers. For reasons of cost-efficiency, their
    strategies are likely to favour closed systems allowing them to gain a competitive
    edge. 6.2. More technology leads to more costs With the integration of information
    technology, precision farming requires more and more comprehensive technology,
    which, while performing better, is also more cost-intensive. However, potential
    savings are relatively small if operations are already running close to optimal
    capacity without the technology. In this case, site-specific fertilisation will,
    at best, lead to a redistribution of the amounts of fertiliser used, and the resulting
    increase in yields are comparatively modest and may not cover additional costs
    unless very large sites are involved. Additional costs, therefore, may only be
    recovered by new management options and reduced environmental impacts, resulting
    from higher quality information. For these benefits, no nationally or internationally
    recognised assessment schemes exist. 6.3. Documentation and environmental performance
    This leads to the question of whether environmental performance should or must
    be documented. Precision farming supplies the tools for such a documentation if
    electronic communication is extended to all machines and equipment. With the implement
    indicator (IMI), this will be possible at low cost, with LBS and GPS once more
    being prerequisites. Definitions for data acquisition density, and thus, for the
    stipulations in the task controller, are required (Fig. 8). The data obtained
    could be the basis for all kinds of environmental achievements as a geo-referenced
    documentation of measures taken (a mark of quality in the resulting products)
    and for public funds designed for environmentally sound agriculture. Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 8. The IMI for automated documentation of geo-referenced
    process data. 6.4. New environmental achievements In this context, precision farming
    could lead to additional environmental achievements. 6.4.1. Fleet management Fleet
    management for the timing of field work and co-ordination of available equipment
    will result in less traffic (via optimised unloading procedures) and a decrease
    in the number of trips, more adequate co-ordination of transport vehicles and
    site-specific accumulation of goods, machinery use in accordance with soil moisture
    and a decrease in energy costs, and integration of local information about soil
    conditions and soil type in maximum load control to avoid permanent soil compressions.
    6.4.2. Field robots Field robots will optimise the use of machinery and lead to
    the decreases in multiple field visitation and overlaps in the application of
    fertiliser and plant protection agents by means of seamless navigation, improved
    total work efficiency by the use of manned guiding vehicles and unmanned follow-up
    units, and a potential reversal of the trend toward ever larger machinery in favour
    of the development and use of smaller field robots. 7. Conclusions The precision
    farming developments of today can provide the technology for the environment friendly
    agriculture of tomorrow. This can be seen in the areas described here below. •
    GPS will supply the required accuracy. Further progress is expected by the improvement
    of NAVSTAR-GPS and the impending installation of Galileo. • Through the standardisation
    within LBS and ISO 11783, mobile electronic communication will be available. Whether
    this signifies the emergence of open systems for tractor-implement combinations
    — independent of manufacturers and of manufacturer-specific systems made by the
    few remaining global agricultural technology providers — remains to be seen. •
    Basic fertilisation with the mapping approach is a system that is available already.
    With fertilisation after removal, intensive sample-taking would become largely
    redundant. • With respect to nitrogen fertilisation, the development of online-sensor
    systems is taking shape. By means of map overlay, site-specific limitations and
    also excess dosages may be taken into account. • With respect to plant protection,
    current manual assessment has proven to be time- and cost-intensive. It remains
    to be seen whether progress in genetic engineering will point site-specific application
    towards a new direction. • Enormous potentials for precision farming may be seen
    in an overall approach to environmentally sound agriculture. These may only be
    tapped, however, if the environmental benefits of geo-referenced information are
    financially rewarded. • Through the use of geo-referenced information, the potential
    of fleet management and field robotics can come to fruition. In this vein, precision
    farming today is already able to supply the technology required for the environmentally
    sound agriculture of tomorrow. Huge efforts will be involved in activating its
    slumbering potentials for the benefit of the environment. Further reading Auernhammer,

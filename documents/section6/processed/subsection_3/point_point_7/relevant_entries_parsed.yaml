    use of water resources and enhance agricultural productivity to meet the growing
    demand for food. IoT devices, communication technologies, big data storage, and
    processing are key components of an IoT ecosystem for smart agriculture. Wireless
    sensor networks (WSN) have been widely used in agriculture, building the foundation
    for developing smart agriculture applications. The unique characteristics of WSN,
    such as the ability to self-organize, self-configure, self-establish, and self-recover,
    make it suitable for smart agriculture applications. The sensor device consists
    of a radio frequency (RF) transceiver, sensor, microcontroller, and battery power.

    [25,26]. According to the Cisco forecast, over 500 billion IoT devices will be
    connected to the Internet by 2030 [27]. The use of IoT and big data will enable
    smart agriculture and is expected to enhance efficiency and productivity [28].
    Over the years, wireless sensor networks (WSN) have been strongly applied in the

    these paradigms to augment the long delay incurred by computing and storage at
    the cloud environment.


    The study explains that fog computing is a newly emerging computing paradigm that
    allows for localized computing and storage close to the source of data being generated

    future fog nodes have to be equipped with AI and machine learning capabilities
    as well as enabled with blockchain interface, whereby localized management, access,
    and control of data are performed by the fog nodes.


    Here, the paper raises an open research challenge regarding the lack of a fog

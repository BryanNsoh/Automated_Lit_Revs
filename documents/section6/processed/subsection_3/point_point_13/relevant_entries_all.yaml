    Footnotes Abstract: Big Data empowers the farming community with the information
    needed to optimize resource usage, increase productivity, and enhance the sustainability
    of agricultural practices. The use of Big Data in farming requires the collection
    and analysis of data from various sources such as sensors, satellites, and farmer
    surveys. While Big Data can provide the farming community with valuable insights
    and improve efficiency, there is significant concern regarding the security of
    this data as well as the privacy of the participants. Privacy regulations, such
    as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the EU Code
    of Conduct on agricultural data sharing by contractual agreement, and the proposed
    EU AI law, have been created to address the issue of data privacy and provide
    specific guidelines on when and how data can be shared between organizations.
    To make confidential agricultural data widely available for Big Data analysis
    without violating the privacy of the data subjects, we consider privacy-preserving
    methods of data sharing in agriculture. Synthetic data that retains the statistical
    properties of the original data but does not include actual individuals’ information
    provides a suitable alternative to sharing sensitive datasets. Deep learning-based
    synthetic data generation has been proposed for privacy-preserving data sharing.
    However, there is a lack of compliance with documented data privacy policies in
    such privacy-preserving efforts. In this study, we propose a novel framework for
    enforcing privacy policy rules in privacy-preserving data generation algorithms.
    We explore several available agricultural codes of conduct, extract knowledge
    related to the privacy constraints in data, and use the extracted knowledge to
    define privacy bounds in a privacy-preserving generative model. We use our framework
    to generate synthetic agricultural data and present experimental results that
    demonstrate the utility of the synthetic dataset in downstream tasks. We... (Show

    Location: Sorrento, Italy SECTION I. Introduction According to the Food and Agriculture
    Organization (FAO) [1], food production needs to be raised by 70% by 2050 to feed
    the projected population of 9.6 billion by 2050. To meet the growing needs of
    an expanding population, the farming community needs efficient ways to enhance
    agricultural productivity, optimize resource utilization, and implement sustainable
    farming practices. Technology plays an essential role in meeting these goals.
    Specifically, the use of Big Data in agriculture enables us to model large volumes
    of crowd-sourced data, sensor measurement data, and environmental information
    to understand emerging patterns in agriculture. This helps us stay ahead of modern
    challenges such as changing climate, farmland depletion, etc. However, sharing
    data from multiple sources raises privacy concerns. Privacy regulations, such
    as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) [2], have specific
    requirements on when and how such data can be shared. Even in the absence of specific
    regulations, individuals may have significant concerns about sharing their private
    information. We need privacy-preserving methods of sharing agricultural data that
    abide by policy regulations and encourage the farming community to participate
    in collective study. The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
    is one of the most comprehensive data protection regulations globally and has
    implications for agricultural data in EU member states. However, it does not specifically
    address data sharing in agriculture. The EU Code of Conduct on agricultural data
    sharing by contractual agreement [3] was created as an addendum to the GDPR. This
    code of conduct (Code) was designed to promote data-sharing leads in agriculture
    by setting transparent principles, clarifying responsibilities, and creating trust
    among partners. The EU A.I. Act proposed in Apri12021 by the European Commission
    proposed as the first EU regulatory framework for AI. It is the first regulation
    of its kind to define and classify AI used in different applications according
    to the risk they pose to users. AI models that pose higher risks require stricter
    regulation. In this study, the EU Code of Conduct on agricultural data sharing
    by contractual agreement [3], and the E.U. A.I. Act [4] have been identified as
    relevant privacy policies that can help us understand privacy concerns related
    to Big Data in agriculture. Privacy in shared data has been discussed in prior
    work focusing on anonymization and encryption of data. However, these methods
    can be costly and not easily scalable. Privacy-preserving data generation refers
    to the process of creating new synthetic data that maintains privacy while retaining
    useful characteristics and statistical properties of the original data. Privacy-preserving
    data generation is a robust way of protecting sensitive data while still making
    them useful for wide-scale sharing. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are
    one of the well-known models for generating synthetic samples that can have the
    same distributional characteristics as the original data. Synthetic data generated
    using privacy-preserving versions of GAN have been shown to replace real data
    for statistical and analytical purposes while protecting sensitive information
    [5]–[8]. While previous studies have successfully generated privacy preserving
    of synthetic data, they do not consider the requirements of privacy regulations.
    Thus, there is a gap between data privacy as defined by the privacy policies and
    the privacy constraints in the privacy-preserving methods. To create a secure
    and privacy-preserving version of agricultural data that aligns with the regulations
    outlined in policy frameworks, we present an innovative framework. This framework
    is designed to generate data while strictly adhering to the guidelines established
    in agricultural privacy regulations. By incorporating the definition of privacy
    from these regulations into our model, we establish privacy constraints that specifically
    address the nuances of shared agricultural data. The resulting synthetic dataset
    serves as a privacy-preserving alternative to confidential data, ensuring compliance
    with the principles outlined in agricultural codes of conduct. Our proposed framework
    effectively mitigates a range of threats, including privacy leakage, re-identification,
    side-channel, linkage, and attribute inference attacks. Through extensive experimentation,
    our model demonstrates resilience against various privacy threat models. Importantly,
    it achieves this while maintaining both statistical similarity to the original
    data and practical utility in downstream tasks. The remainder of this paper is
    organized as follows. Section II establishes the background and motivation for
    our work in the context of potential threats against privacy-preserving framework,
    privacy policy regulations, and privacy-preserving data generation efforts. Section
    III presents our framework for policy enforcement in privacy-preserving data generation
    through rule extraction from privacy regulation and attribute regulation in generative
    models. Section IV presents the results of our experimental work on policy-enforced
    data sharing Agricultural data. Section V presents the literature review on privacy
    regulations and methods to secure agriculture data from potential threats. The
    conclusion and future work are shown in Section VI. Figure 1: Overview of Potential
    Threats. Show All SECTION II. Background and Motivation A. Privacy Threat Models
    in Agriculture In the agricultural domain, privacy-preserving mechanisms are designed
    to protect individuals’ sensitive information while allowing data to be analyzed
    and utilized for various purposes. However, these mechanisms can also be vulnerable
    to specific attacks that attempt to compromise the privacy they aim to preserve.
    Here are some potential threats against privacy-preserving measures, where threats
    are categorized as intentional and unintentional threats. 1) Deliberate Threats:
    Attribute inference attack: In attribute inference attacks, an attacker tries
    to reconstruct the original training data or extract sensitive information from
    the model’s parameters. This type of attack is particularly concerning when the
    model is used to process private or personal data. Re-identification Attacks:
    Even if individual data points are anonymized, attackers could use auxiliary information
    from other sources to link seemingly anonymous data back to specific individuals,
    thereby breaching their privacy. Membership Inference Attacks: These attacks attempt
    to determine whether a specific data point was used during the training process.
    By analyzing the model’s outputs, an attacker can infer whether a particular data
    point was part of the training dataset, potentially revealing sensitive information
    about the data owner. Side-Channel Attacks: These attacks focus on exploiting
    unintended information leakage during the execution of privacy-preserving algorithms.
    By analyzing execution time, memory usage, or power consumption, attackers might
    gain insights into the data being processed. 2) Inadvertent Threats: Data Leakage:
    Confidentiality breach in agricultural data refers to a situation where sensitive
    or private information related to agriculture is unintentionally disclosed to
    unauthorized individuals or entities. This breach could involve the exposure of
    data such as farming practices, crop yields, land ownership details, financial
    information, and other sensitive information that farmers or agricultural organizations
    would prefer to keep confidential. Configuration Error: A configuration error
    as an unintentional error in agricultural data refers to a mistake or oversight
    made during the setup or arrangement of technology systems and software used in
    the agricultural context. These errors occur due to misconfigurations or incorrect
    settings that lead to unintended consequences or outcomes in the collection, storage,
    processing, or sharing of agricultural data.For instance, in precision agriculture
    where data-driven technologies are used to optimize farming practices, a configuration
    error could involve setting incorrect parameters for sensors, drones, or automated
    machinery. This might result in inaccurate data collection, leading to flawed
    decisions about irrigation, fertilization, or pest control. Inaccurate Encryption:
    Inaccurate encryption as an unintentional error in agricultural data refers to
    the incorrect implementation or utilization of encryption techniques meant to
    secure sensitive information related to agriculture. Encryption is a process of
    converting data into a secure, unreadable format to prevent unauthorized access
    or data breaches. However, when encryption is applied improperly or inaccurately,
    it can lead to unintended consequences and compromise the confidentiality of agricultural
    data.For instance, if encryption keys (the codes required to decrypt the data)
    are managed inadequately, there’s a risk of unauthorized parties gaining access
    to the decrypted information. Additionally, using weak encryption algorithms or
    outdated encryption methods might render the data susceptible to decryption by
    attackers with sufficient computing power or knowledge.Inaccurate encryption practices
    in agriculture data could also involve failing to encrypt all necessary data fields
    or overlooking specific data sources, leaving certain parts of the information
    vulnerable to exposure. This can be particularly concerning when dealing with
    sensitive data such as crop yield projections, land ownership details, or financial
    records. Unauthorized Access: Unauthorized access as an unintentional error in
    agricultural data refers to situations where individuals or entities gain entry
    to sensitive agricultural information without proper authorization or permission.
    This error occurs due to vulnerabilities in data security measures, misconfigured
    access controls, or inadvertent lapses in safeguarding agricultural data.For instance,
    if an agricultural database containing information about crop yields, pricing
    strategies, or proprietary farming techniques lacks proper access controls, unauthorized
    individuals could gain access to this information. This could happen due to weak
    passwords, lack of encryption, or overlooking permissions that restrict data access
    to only authorized personnel.Unintentional unauthorized access might also occur
    if a legitimate user inadvertently shares login credentials or access links with
    unintended parties or if attackers exploit a software vulnerability to gain entry
    to sensitive agricultural databases. B. Privacy Regulations in Agriculture Code
    of Conduct describes contractual relations and guides the use of agricultural
    data, particularly on the rights of use and access of the data. Code was a collaborative
    step between massive institutions representing various enterprises producing animal
    fertilizers, seeds, feed, or farm machinery and agents of animal breeding organizations
    as well as farmer’s cooperatives in the EU associated with the Council on Ethical
    & Judicial Affairs (CEJA) [9] and Copa-Cogeca (that concentrates on young farmers
    up to 40 years of age). In establishing the Code, it was highlighted by the parties
    that “the Code promotes the advantages of data sharing and allows agribusiness
    models, including agri-cooperatives and other agri-businesses, to shift into an
    age of digitally enhanced farming swiftly.” [3] The European Parliament has also
    launched a substantial amount of work in AI. Recently, “The AI ACT” [4] has been
    proposed to protect user’s data from AI risks. The European Parliament has also
    launched a substantial amount of work in AI. Due to extreme technological transition
    in recent years and potential challenges, the EU desires balanced practices. The
    Union aims to preserve the EU’s technological supervision and assurance that Europeans
    can benefit from new technologies designed and performed according to Union rules
    and regulations. Figure 2 shows the relation between the EU Code and the AI Act.
    C. Synthetic Data in Privacy Various approaches have been proposed for privacy-preserving
    data sharing. Some common approaches towards privacy use differential privacy
    [10], K-anonymity [11], L-diversity [12] and t-closeness [13]. Privacy-Preserving
    Generative Models use Generative models like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
    to generate synthetic data that closely mimics the original data distribution.
    This synthetic data can be shared without revealing actual individual data thus
    providing privacy. Generative adversarial Networks (GANs) is a class of deep learning-based
    generative model in AI. GANs are extremely accurate in synthetic data generation
    and translation, particularly for image and text data [14]–[17]. The principal
    architecture in a GAN framework involves a generative model G that captures the
    data distribution, and a discriminative model D that estimates the probability
    that a sample came from the original distribution rather than G. The training
    procedure for G is to maximize the probability of D making a mistake. As the training
    progresses, the generator gets better at generating new examples that plausibly
    come close to the samples from the original distribution. The idea behind GAN
    can be formulated as a two-player min-max game with value function V(G, D): min
    G max D V(G,D)= E x∼ p data a (x) [logD(x)] + E z∼ p z (z) [log(1−D(G(z)))] (1)
    View Source Figure 2: EU Code of Conduct Vs. AI Act Show All For agricultural
    data, the data is usually tabular i.e. a mix of discrete and continuous values.
    Additionally, the continuous values are not arbitrarily random and usually follow
    a specific distribution within a given range. To account for this, we need specialized
    versions of GAN that can accurately replicate system data that is collected over
    our digital twin. In an unconditioned generative model, there is no control over
    the modes of the data being generated. Conditional Generative Adversarial Nets
    (CGAN) [18] introduces the concept that by conditioning the model on additional
    information, it is possible to direct the data generation process. The objective
    function of the two-player minimax game is rewritten as: min G max D V(G,D)= E
    x∼ p data  (x) [logD(x∣y)] + E z∼ p x (z) [log(1−D(G(z∣y)))] (2) View Source To
    ensure that the synthetic dataset is distributionally close to the original dataset,
    and provides privacy protection by the principle of t-closeness, Kotal et al.
    [8] propose the use of Earth Mover’s distance (EMD). he The EMD of the distribution
    of features in the synthetic is calculated w.r. t. the original dataset. The sampling
    process continues to sample from the trained generator till the generated distribution
    is within a threshold distance of the original distribution. To address the challenges
    of tabular data, the model uses three key steps during generation: (1) Mode-specific
    normalization, (2) Conditional Generator, and (3) Training by sampling. SECTION
    III. Privacy Preserving Data Generation with Policy Enforcement The various models
    proposed for privacy-preserving data sharing do not take into regulations on Information
    Privacy. While they can provide privacy protection for data, there is still a
    gap between privacy as ensured by these models and privacy as required by the
    law. Bridging this gap requires translating legal privacy requirements into machine-enforceable
    values and mechanisms. This involves understanding the key principles of data
    protection regulations and incorporating them into designing and implementing
    privacy-preserving models. This work proposes a novel framework for Policy Enforcement
    in privacy-preserving data generation. We process the relevant privacy regulations
    and extract privacy rules from the human written document. The rules are converted
    into a machine-readable and enforceable format. The privacy rule sets are then
    used to guide the privacy-preserving data generation model. Figure 3 demonstrates
    the overall architecture of our proposed framework. A. Rule Extraction from Privacy
    Regulations We use a Deontic Logic Rule-based approach to extract relevant rules
    from Privacy regulations into a machine-enforceable format. First, we create a
    predefined list of modal verbs used to express obligation types in legal domains.
    Next, we tokenize each token in the set and use the Python library to get dependency
    analysis and POS (part of speech) tags. The algorithm searches for predefined
    triggers within a given sentence to extract its position (starting index), each
    mention of the trigger, and its dependency tags. Deontic modality [19] [20] is
    predominantly used in legal documents to describe vendors’ prohibitions, obligations,
    and permissions. For instance, ‘may’, ‘must’, and ‘must not’, frame ‘permission’,
    ‘obligation’, and ‘prohibition’ respectively. Table I defines all the deontic
    types, and Table II has all the model verbs associated with each deontic type.
    Modality guides the linguistic ability to express alternative forms the world
    could be and is generally represented by modal auxiliaries such as must, can,
    shall, will, and may. Below are some examples from the EU Code of Conduct for
    agriculture. Permission Rule 1: The farmer can provide data to land owners, potato
    processors, the government, paying authorities, etc. [3] Permission Rule 2: Unless
    otherwise agreed in the contract, the data originator can transmit this data to
    another data user. [3] Obligation Rule 1: Contracts must not be amended without
    the prior consent of the data originator. [3] Obligation Rule 2: Parties may not
    use, process, or share data without the consent of the data originator. [3] Prohibition
    Rule 1: Data cannot be owned in the same way as physical assets. [3] Prohibition
    Rule 2: Parties may not use, process, or share data without the consent of the
    data originator. [3] Figure 3: Framework for Privacy-Preserving Data Generation
    in Agriculture with Privacy Policy Enforcement Show All Table I Deontic Types
    Taxonomy B. Policy enforcement in Data Generation The rules extracted from policy
    documents in Section III-A form a rule set. This rule set is used to guide the
    data generation process. We use the Privetab model [8] for privacy-preserving
    data generation. The principle of privacy used in the model is t-closeness [13]
    which stipulates that the distributional similarity between the original and synthetic
    data should be within a threshold to ensure privacy. The threshold value is not
    pre-determined and often determined based on the needs of an organization. To
    ensure that these privacy constraints meet the requirements of the privacy regulations,
    we use two key steps: Table II Modal Verbs For Deontic Types 1) Determine Attribute
    Sensitivity: According to the EU Code of Conduct and “The AI Act” all the features
    in the dataset are associated with the relevant rule and risk level. We use the
    rule set extracted from the privacy policy to determine the risk level of each
    attribute in the original data. Attributes are categorized into three levels of
    sensitivity: low, medium and high. Highly sensitive attributes are extremely risky
    to share and thus require the highest privacy protection. Attributes with low
    sensitivity are less risky and thus can be shared with minimal risks. 2) Enforce
    privacy threshold based on Sensitivity category: When generating the privacy-preserving
    synthetic dataset, we have to ensure that the privacy threshold is satisfied.
    The value of the privacy threshold can be tuned. Based on the attribute sensitivity
    of the dataset determined from privacy regulations, we modulate the privacy threshold
    for each attribute. The high-risk attributes have the strictest threshold for
    privacy. The privacy threshold for low-risk attributes is less strict. This ensures
    that the privacy requirements of the regulations are met in this process while
    maintaining the utility of the generated data for downstream tasks. SECTION IV.
    Experimental Results Our framework for privacy-preserving data generation with
    policy enforcement can be used for sharing sensitive datasets. We demonstrate
    the use of our framework for Agricultural Big Data as a proof-of-concept. In this
    section, we use our framework to generate a privacy-preserving version of the
    ITM4Impact dataset [21]. The implementation of our policy-enforced privacy-preserving
    data generation framework is made available in a library1. We provide the experimental
    results to demonstrate that our framework provides a privacy-preserving alternative
    for sensitive datasets that is still useful in downstream tasks. A. Dataset In
    this experiment, we use the ITM4Impact dataset [21] collected by the ILRI institute
    to measure and determine the impact of infection and treatment method (ITM) on
    farmers. This dataset was anonymized for public release. We observe that some
    of the information shared in this dataset is privacy sensitive and poses a risk
    towards re-identification of participating farmers. In the ITM4Impact dataset,
    there are around 800 attributes. Approximately more than 140 groups segregate
    these attributes into multiple categories. According to the EU Code of Conduct
    and “The AI Act”, all the features in the dataset are associated with the relevant
    rule and risk level. More than 500 attributes are related to the farmer PII data
    or the data generated in the farming environment and categorized with a “High”
    privacy level. More than 270 attributes, as per regulation, fall under “Medium”
    risk, and only around 30 features can be public and can be shared with the public.
    However, we see that many breaches have happened often, and people end up paying
    huge penalties for not securing the information by adhering to the regulation
    policies. As mentioned in the regulatory document, it is crucial that this data
    should be secured and cannot be shared unless the individual has permission. Below
    are some of the rules extracted from the regulation for applying them to the relevant
    attributes in the dataset: The data originator can store data in a primary location,
    in a data platform, or cloud-based storage platforms. [3] The datasets should
    only be kept for as long as is strictly necessary for the relevant analyses to
    be carried out. [3] If the data is being used to make decisions about the data
    originator “as a natural person” the GDPR applies. For instance, the rights regarding
    data produced on the farm or during farming operations are granted to (“owned
    by”) the farmer and may be used extensively by them. [3] B. Fidelity Results Evaluating
    the fidelity of synthetically generated data is a critical step in assessing the
    effectiveness of your privacy-preserving data generation framework. By measuring
    the realisticness of synthetic data, we can determine how closely it resembles
    real data and its potential for utility in downstream tasks. We provide two fidelity
    metrics for our model. 1) T-SNE Visualization: For utility in downstream tasks,
    it is important that the synthetic dataset provides the same data coverage as
    the original dataset. As observed in Figure 4 for privacy-preserving data generation,
    there is minimal loss in coverage from the original dataset from both with and
    without policy enforcement in the generation process. Figure 4: Comparison of
    T-SNE projection of Original and Privacy-preserving Synthetic Data Show All 2)
    Statistical Similarity: We provide an of the statistical resemblance between the
    original and synthetic datasets for attributes at the 3 different risk levels.
    In general, the metrics demonstrate a strong consistency between the synthetic
    datasets generated with our framework and the original dataset. Figure 5, 6 and
    7 shows the cumulative distribution function (CDF) graphs comparing the original
    and synthetic data for three attributes at low, medium, and high privacy risk
    level respectively. The average KS statistic, which measures the maximum difference
    in CDFs between the original and synthetic data is 0.04 for a113 attributes. Figure
    5: Comparison of CDF for Original vs Synthetic data in Low Risk Attribute Show
    All Figure 6: Comparison of CDF for Original vs Synthetic data in Medium Risk
    Attribute Show All C. Utility Results It is important that the resultant dataset
    of our framework is still useful in replacing the original dataset for downstream
    tasks. One of the most important use cases of big data is in the field of Machine
    learning (ML). We show here that the data generated from our framework can replace
    the original dataset for ML prediction tasks. We evaluated ML models trained on
    the original dataset against ML models trained on the generated data. Consistent
    performance across both models would signify that the synthetic data retains relevant
    information for the task. It is important to note here the test set should be
    the same to compare the performance of both models. One of the use cases of ML
    prediction for agricultural data is farmer category prediction. We use 4 ML predictive
    models here: Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF),
    and Gradient Boosting Classifier (GBC). As observed in Figure 8a and Figure 8b,
    the ML prediction models have comparable performance on data generated both with
    and without policy enforcement. The average accuracy of ML models trained on the
    original data is 0.95. The average accuracy of ML models trained on synthetic
    data generated without policy enforcement is 0.9. The average accuracy of ML models
    trained on synthetic data generated without policy enforcement is 0.895. The average
    loss in accuracy for ML models trained on synthetic data generated without policy
    enforcement is 0.05. The average loss in accuracy for ML models trained on synthetic
    data generated without policy enforcement is 0.055. Thus there is an average loss
    of 0.005 in accuracy of data generated with vs without policy enforcement. Thus
    the data generated from our framework retains the most relevant information for
    downstream ML tasks. Figure 7: Comparison of CDF for Original vs Synthetic data
    in High Risk Attribute Show All D. Privacy Results 1) Attribute Inference Attack:
    In attribute inference attacks, an attacker tries to reconstruct the original
    training data or extract sensitive information from the model’s parameters. In
    this setting, an adversary has partial knowledge of some training records and
    access to a model trained on those records and infers the unknown values of a
    sensitive feature of those records. Attribute inference attacks typically use
    ML models to learn about the original dataset from the predictions of the trained
    model and try to predict the values of unknown sensitive attributes with a confidence
    score. Efficient Attribute Inference attacks can break privacy-preserving efforts
    by un-masking the values of sensitive attributes. The lower accuracy of attribute
    inference attack models proves that privacy-preserving algorithms are efficient
    in evading these attacks. In Figure 9, we compare the results of a re-identification
    attack against privacy-preserving datasets generated with and without policy enforcement.
    For a113 risk levels, the accuracy of the attribute inference attack model is
    lower for the dataset generated with our framework of policy enforcement. for
    privacy-preserving data generated without policy enforcement, the average attribute
    inference attack accuracy is 0.35 across the 3 privacy risk levels. For privacy-preserving
    data generated without policy enforcement, the average attribute inference attack
    accuracy is 0.3 across the 3 privacy risk levels. Thus, there is a 0.05 increase
    in accuracy loss for data generated with policy enforcement. For attributes with
    high privacy risk, the increase in accuracy loss is 0.08. This shows that the
    dataset generated with our approach is more resistant to attribute inference attacks.
    Figure 8: Prediction performance with the model trained on Original vs Privacy-preserving
    Synthetic Data Show All 2) Re-identification Attack: Re-identification attacks
    are variations of linkage attacks where even if individual data points are anonymized,
    attackers could use auxiliary information from other sources to link seemingly
    anonymous data back to specific individuals, thereby breaching their privacy.
    Efficient re-identification algorithms use ML to infer information about anonymized
    datasets with partial knowledge of the original dataset or auxiliary information.
    It is then used to predict de-anonymized values of sensitive attributes in a dataset.
    Higher accuracy of re-identification attacks in de-identified datasets shows that
    the dataset still contains considerable privacy risk. In Figure 10, we compare
    the results of the re-identification attack against privacy-preserving datasets
    generated with and without policy enforcement. Data generated without policy enforcement
    has a consistent accuracy against re-identification attacks for the 3 risk levels
    of attributes ( ≈ 0.50). For attributes with low privacy risk, the re-identification
    attack model has comparable accuracy (0.51) against our framework with policy
    enforcement. However, for attributes with medium and high privacy risk, our framework
    with policy enforcement works better with an average accuracy loss of 0.07 in
    re-identification attacks. Thus the dataset generated with our approach is more
    resistant against reidentification attacks. Figure 9: Comparison of Accuracy of
    Attribute Inference attacks against privacy preserving data generation with vs

    Show All SECTION V. Related Work In the absence of precisely elaborated rules
    on the appropriate ways to deal with the legal implications of digital farming
    technologies on agricultural companies and relation-ships, farmers and their agribusiness
    organizations who deliver digital farming technologies started to shape their
    policies to enhance agricultural data management techniques and provide a foundation
    for reliable data sharing. Agricultural security and privacy principles and codes
    of conduct have been developed in different parts of the world. In 2014, in the
    U.S., the American Farm Bureau’s Privacy and Security Principles for Farm Data
    (2019) [22] was the foremost to draw awareness to some of the problems farmers
    had about how their information was being collected and shared. After this initiative
    was 2014 New Zealand’s Farm Data Code of Practice [23], and more recently, in
    2019, we noticed the E.U. Code of Conduct launch on agricultural data sharing
    by contractual agreement [3]. With the recent advances in Big Data, there is a
    gap between the computational capabilities and the data available for research.
    Data scientists are invested in gathering large volumes of data with secure and
    privacy-preserving approaches. Privacy-preserving methods and the impact of privacy
    policies on data sharing have been an ongoing avenue of research [24]–[28]. There
    has been significant research in designing privacy-preserving data-sharing methods.
    However, most approaches have a caveat associated with them. Among these various
    privacy approaches, differential privacy [10], K-anonymity [11], L-diversity [12],
    and t-closeness [13] are worth noting. It has also been shown that achieving one
    of the privacy metrics can ensure others [29]. Synthetic data can provide anonymity
    to original data with-out loss of accuracy in downstream data analysis tasks.
    In general, there is a lot of evidence of GANs being used for synthetic data generation
    and translation in image and text data [14]–[17]. However, the properties of system
    or device data make it distinct from image and text data. The system data is usually
    tabular i.e. contains a mix of continuous and discrete variables, and in some
    cases, the sequence of consecutive rows in the data is important. A conditional
    generator model can address the issue of mixed attributes in tabular data by seeking
    to minimize the distance between generated and real data given a fixed value of
    the discrete variable [8], [30]–[34]. While there are privacy-preserving models
    for data sharing, these models do not take into account the rules stated in privacy
    policies such as GDPR [35] [36], EU code of conduct [3] etc. Hence, there is no
    mechanism to ensure that data shared through these frameworks are compliant with
    the privacy policies. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework that learns
    rules from the privacy policies and inducts the information in the generation
    process of a privacy-preserving GAN to ensure that the data generated is privacy-preserving,
    secure to share, and compliant with the data policies. Gupta et al. [37] presented
    a vast exposure to cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities in smart farming
    environments. This research [38] proposed PrivySharing, a blockchain-based innovative
    framework for privacy-preserving and secure IoT data sharing in a smart city environment.
    West [39] introduced a principles-based framework to assess cyber-attack vulner-abilities
    and also constructed a precision agriculture system protected from cyber-attacks.
    Coble et al. [40] discussed a set of analytical techniques that are increasingly
    relevant to solving security and privacy issues. Kumar et al. [41] proposed a
    Secured Privacy-Preserving Framework (SP2F) for smart agricultural Unmanned Aerial
    Vehicles (UAVs), which handles various cyber attacks. In addition, several security
    models for protecting big data in various domains are discussed in [42]–[48].
    SECTION VI. Conclusion and Future Work Technology, particularly the integration
    of big data analysis, data processing, cloud computing, and IoT devices, plays
    a pivotal role in enhancing agricultural output both quantitatively and qualitatively.
    Utilizing these technological advancements enables the agricultural sector to
    address intricate challenges by effectively analyzing large volumes of crowd-sourced
    data. However, the sharing of data across various sources raises privacy concerns.
    While GDPR and similar general privacy regulations provide a foundation for digital
    data sharing, the specific privacy risks pertinent to agricultural data remain
    unclear. Defining agricultural big data is still an ongoing debate, making it
    challenging to delineate privacy concerns. This study delves into the EU Code
    of Conduct on agricultural data sharing, established through contractual agreements
    as an extension of GDPR and the E.U. A.I. Act, to comprehensively understand privacy
    concerns in the realm of agricultural data. Though there have been privacy-preserving
    efforts in data sharing, there is a lack of policy enforcement in such efforts.
    To address the challenge of data sharing while ensuring consistency with privacy
    regulations, this paper introduces a novel frame-work for enforcing policy rules
    in privacy-preserving data sharing. This approach not only mitigates privacy risks
    like leakage and re-identification but also bridges the gap between privacy-preserving
    methods and policy-defined privacy requirements. The experimental results show
    that this framework retains substantial statistical similarity with original data
    and retains utility in downstream tasks while being resistant to privacy threat
    models. In conclusion, the proposed framework showcases a promising direction
    for reconciling agricultural data sharing and privacy concerns, ensuring a sustainable
    and secure future for agricultural research and advancement. In the future, we
    would like to extend this framework for policy enforcement in other domains that
    need privacy-preserving efforts in data sharing, such as health, security, etc.

    Communications and Sensing for 6G and Beyond: A Comprehensive Review Wei Jiang
    and 14 more April 04, 2024 Next-generation cellular technologies, commonly referred
    to as the sixth generation (6G), are envisioned to support a higher system capacity,
    better performance, and network sensing capabilities. The terahertz (THz) band
    is one potential enabler to this end due to the large unused frequency bands and
    the high spatial resolution enabled by the short signal wavelength and large bandwidth.
    Different from earlier surveys, this paper presents a comprehensive treatment
    and technology survey on THz communications and sensing in terms of advantages,
    Rapid Feasibility Assessment of Energy Unit Integration in Distribution Networks
    Sicheng Gong and 2 more April 03, 2024 In contemporary heavy-load distribution
    networks, preceding feasibility assessment is imperative before incorporating
    additional energy units. However, the feasibility examination for massive combined
    operational scenarios of relevant units is computationally intensive with repetitive
    power flow calculations. To this end, this paper proposes a rapid assessment framework,
    the kernel of which is to learn from formerly examined scenarios, thus forming
    expansive feasible/infeasible regions to geometrically rule in/out subsequent
    scenarios. Without running the power flow computation in most scenarios, we accelerate
    the assessment process. Moreover, enlightened by heuristic hypersurface search,
    such prechecking efficiency can be further boosted. In a risk-averse manner, this
    framework can be conceptualized using the exact grid model. Especially, evidenced
    by testing on a 10.5kV distribution grid, the framework shows a significant assessment
    efficiency improvement and strict accuracy guarantee, where we observe at least
    76.13% assessment time reduction and zero accuracy loss in all testing cases.
    We anticipate this work to be a starting point for more sophisticated geometry-accelerating
    feasibility assessment methods. Improving Molecular De Novo Drug Design with Transformers
    Dhaval Soni and 7 more April 03, 2024 Drug design is undergoing a transformation
    as we challenge conventional methods by integrating state-of-the-art artificial
    intelligence with the intricate domain of molecular biology. At the heart of our
    endeavor lies a significant challenge: the scarcity of datasets containing active
    compounds for emerging target proteins. To confront this obstacle, we''re pioneering
    an innovative approach. We''re merging the advanced Generative Pre-trained Transformer
    (GPT) architecture with the nuanced capabilities of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
    networks, with the aim of generating Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System
    (SMILES) strings to unveil novel therapeutic pathways. Additionally, we''re employing
    a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) pretraining strategy
    to enrich our model with comprehensive molecular data, including amino acid sequences
    and molecular SMILES datasets. Through meticulous fine-tuning on a meticulously
    curated protein-ligand complex dataset, we''re achieving precise conditional generation
    via autoregressive supervised learning. Our research introduces a groundbreaking
    method to assess molecular affinity, validated against established proteins, showcasing
    superior binding affinities compared to certain FDA-approved drugs in docking
    experiments. By pushing the boundaries of generative algorithms and establishing
    a robust framework for evaluating molecular affinity, we''re driving forward the
    field of de novo drug design, offering promising therapeutic avenues and enabling
    deeper exploration of the chemical landscape. Formalising a Gateway-based Blockchain

    Behavior of NO Fe-Si Sheets under Tensile and Compressive Stress Carlo Appino
    and 6 more April 03, 2024 The stress dependence of the magnetic properties of
    non-oriented Fe-Si steel sheets has been investigated by measurement and analysis
    of hysteresis loop, magnetization curve, and energy losses taken at different
    peak polarization values Jp (0.5 T – 1.5 T) between DC and f = 400 Hz. The salient
    feature of the material response to the stress lies in the monotonic deterioration
    of the soft magnetic properties, across the whole (Jp - f) domain, on passing
    from the maximum tensile stress (σ = +30 MPa) to the maximum compression (σ =
    -30 MPa). This is understood in terms of stress-induced redistribution of the
    domains between easy axes, making magnetic hardening by compression directly related
    to unfavorably directed domains and 90° domain-wallmediated magnetization transitions.
    The loss decomposition is carried out across the whole investigated frequency
    range, taking into account the skin effect at the highest frequencies. Quasi-static
    and dynamic losses follow a same trend with σ, both monotonically increasing on
    passing from the tensile to the compressive stress limits, according to the theoretically
    expected relationship existing between the hysteresis and the excess loss components.
    The latter is shown to identify the correlation regions where the magnetization
    is reversed of size comparable with the average grain size and loosely following
    the dependence of the loss figure on the applied stress. A bio-inspired hardware
    implementation of an analog spike-based hippocampus memory mo... Daniel Casanueva-Morato
    and 4 more April 03, 2024 The need for processing at the edge the increasing amount
    of data that is being produced by multitudes of sensors has led to the demand
    for mode power efficient computational systems, by exploring alternative computing
    paradigms and technologies. Neuromorphic engineering is a promising approach that
    can address this need by developing electronic systems that faithfully emulate
    the computational properties of animal brains. In particular, the hippocampus
    stands out as one of the most relevant brain region for implementing auto associative
    memories capable of learning large amounts of information quickly and recalling
    it efficiently. In this work, we present a computational spike-based memory model
    inspired by the hippocampus that takes advantage of the features of analog electronic
    circuits: energy efficiency, compactness, and real-time operation. This model
    can learn memories, recall them from a partial fragment and forget. It has been
    implemented as a Spiking Neural Networks directly on a mixed-signal neuromorphic
    chip. We describe the details of the hardware implementation and demonstrate its
    operation via a series of benchmark experiments, showing how this research prototype
    paves the way for the development of future robust and low-power mixed-signal
    neuromorphic processing systems. Exploratory Study of oneM2M-based Interoperability
    Architectures for IoT: A Smart Cit... VJS Pranavasri and 6 more April 03, 2024
    The advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) has ushered in transformative possibilities
    for smart cities, with the potential to revolutionize urban living through enhanced
    connectivity and data-driven decision-making. However, the effective realization
    of IoT in smart cities hinges upon the seamless interoperability of diverse devices
    and systems. To address this critical need, the oneM2M standards initiative has
    emerged as a foundational framework for IoT interoperability. In this research
    paper, we perform an exploratory analysis of three prominent open-source oneM2M
    based interoperability systems-Mobius, OM2M, and ACME. We leverage an existing
    large-scale system provided by our Smart City Living Lab deployed at IIIT Hyderabad,
    sprawling a 66-acre campus featuring over 370 nodes across eight verticals. We
    investigate the architectural characteristics of each solution, considering their
    strengths and limitations in facilitating IoT interoperability. Through this analysis,
    our paper aims to provide valuable insights for stakeholders seeking to implement
    IoT interoperability solutions in the context of smart cities. By evaluating the
    strengths and limitations of Mobius, OM2M, and ACME, we seek to offer guidance
    for selecting the most suitable solution. Our analysis reveals that the optimal
    framework choice depends on specific quality constraints: Mobius excels in performance,
    while ACME offers advantages in ease of setup for smaller-scale implementations.
    Comparing Concepts of Service Blocking Queues in Hardware-in-the-Loop Systems
    Tobias Konheiser and 3 more April 03, 2024 ZF is developing an autonomous driving
    system, which requires extensive testing of the developed devices and software
    on hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) systems. Therefore, a robust and high-performing
    HIL system is essential. The purpose of a HIL system is to replay recorded data
    to the device-undertest. Recordings are loaded, processed and streamed to the
    deviceunder-test with real-time requirements. This streaming chain includes processing
    nodes and queues. This requires careful management of queue configurations. An
    overflow in the queue will result in packet loss, while an underflow may violate
    the real-time constraint. This study aims to develop and evaluate concepts for
    service blocking queues. These concepts block or pause the incoming service to
    a queue when necessary to avoid queue overflows and associated data loss. However,
    an out-of-the-box solution is not available and different approaches affect the
    behaviour and performance of the system. Therefore, the developed concepts are
    evaluated against each other and against the existing system based on selected
    performance parameters in specific scenarios. The scenarios cover a wide range
    of situations, reflecting standard input data with varying numbers of parallel
    streams and bottleneck scenarios forcing queue overflows or blockages. The developed
    service blocking queue concepts eliminate data loss in all scenarios, but introduce
    overhead, resulting in reduced system performance. However, the service blocking
    queue concept using a modified token-bucket approach proved to be the best solution,
    as the elimination of data loss justifies the additional overhead. This concept
    is proposed for implementation and deployment on the HIL system. Generative AI-Based
    Text Generation Methods Using Pre-Trained GPT 2 Model Rohit Pandey and 7 more
    April 03, 2024 A text generation model is a machine learning model that uses neural
    networks, especially transformers architecture to generate contextually relevant
    text based on linguistic patterns learned from extensive corpora. The models are
    trained on a huge amount of textual data so that they can model and learn complex
    concepts of any language like its grammar, vocabulary, phrases, and styles. FlowDep
    - An efficient and optical-flow-based algorithm of obstacle detection for aut...
    Chen-Fu Yeh and 7 more April 03, 2024 Obstacle detection is crucial for the safety
    and efficiency of autonomous vehicles. For mini-vehicles such as palm-sized drones,
    it is a challenge to implement traditional methods like Lidar due to high costs
    and physical constraints. Vision-based deep learning approaches, while accurate,
    are too resource-intensive for the mini-vehicles. To address this issue, we introduce
    Flowdep, a novel optical-flow-based algorithm inspired by the low-resolution but
    efficient motion-detection mechanisms in insects. Flowdep combines optic flow
    and IMU (or positioning information) to estimate the depth of every image pixel.
    We also generate a variant of Flowdep using the artificial neural network (Flowdep-ANN).
    Our tests show that Flowdep and Flowdep-ANN are 5.8 to 114.7 times faster than
    the DNN networks we tested, while the accuracies of Flowdep and Flowdep-ANN are
    on par with these networks. We further tested Flowdep and Flowdep-ANN on a small
    autonomous vehicle with Raspberry Pi4 as the computing platform, and both models
    successfully performed real-time object detection. The present work demonstrates
    the potential of using optical flow as an efficient approach to estimate depth
    and detect obstacles in resource-constrained mini-vehicles. Misinformative Data
    Visualizations in the Sports Media Domain Drew Scott April 03, 2024 Sports are
    data-driven: individual performances are measured using statistics and teams leverage
    data analytics to outperform competition. Sports media-which is created by media
    outlets, teams, and individuals-engage its consumers by creating narratives about
    the sport, teams, and players. Due to the importance of data in the sports world,
    data visualizations are a pillar in the sports media landscape. These data visualizations,
    while appearing to accurately convey data to its consumers, can be misinformative;
    media creators often have incentives to present specific narratives which don''t
    always fit the data. This work contributes to an existing misinformative data
    visualization taxonomy. In doing so, it makes it easier to understand the techniques
    and design choices used to create misinformative visualizations in all domains,
    not only in sports media. A Survey of RFID Authentication Protocols Drew Scott
    April 03, 2024 "Radio frequency identification" (RFID) systems are ubiquitous
    in today''s world. In an RFID system, it is a desirable to attain mutual authentication
    between a reader and a tag before commencing application-level communications.
    This is because tags should not share secret information with unknown parties
    and readers need to defend against tag impersonation. Authentication protocols
    designed for communication between computers, however, are not appropriate for
    RFID systems because tags are extremely resource constrained (low energy, small
    memory, etc.). Thus, there have been many attempts to design secure and practical
    authentication protocols for RFID systems over the years since RFID systems became
    prevalent. This survey summarizes and compares these protocols. The Effect of
    Multipath in Distributed Arrays with Time Reversal Hassna Ouassal and 2 more April
    03, 2024 This article examines the effect of multipath channels on the performance
    of distributed arrays that employ time reversal. A model of the signal received
    from a distributed array is formulated, and a statistical analysis of the variation
    in signal power in the presence of phase noise and multipath is given. We present
    the impact these nonidealities have on received signal power, and we analyze the
    received power for three specific cases: continuous waveform, impulse waveform,
    and modulated rectangular pulse waveform in the presence of standard channel models.
    It is shown that for larger arrays in multipath channels, the change in power
    between coherent and incoherent states converges to the line-of-sight channel.
    It is further shown that in a line-of-sight channel time-reversal completely cancels
    unknown channel delays resulting in coherent signals from all nodes in a distributed
    array, while in a multipath channel only the main diagonal round-trip paths are
    coherent. Nevertheless, this additional benefit improves signal coherence in complex
    channels and can aide in distributed array synchronization using two-way time
    transfer. Disproof of Hodge Conjecture by Graph Theory Jihyeon Yoon April 02,
    2024 Hodge conjecture is turned out to be false in extension of graph theory based
    on its algebraic attribute. Hash3D: Training-free Acceleration for 3D Generation
    Xingyi Yang and 1 more April 02, 2024 The evolution of 3D generative modeling
    has been notably propelled by the adoption of 2D diffusion models. Despite this
    progress, the cumbersome optimization process per se presents a critical hurdle
    to efficiency. In this paper, we introduce Hash3D, a universal acceleration for
    3D generation without model training. Central to Hash3D is the insight that feature-map
    redundancy is prevalent in images rendered from camera positions and diffusion
    time-steps in close proximity. By effectively hashing and reusing these feature
    maps across neighboring timesteps and camera angles, Hash3D substantially prevents
    redundant calculations, thus accelerating the diffusion model''s inference in
    3D generation tasks. We achieve this through an adaptive grid-based hashing. Surprisingly,
    this feature-sharing mechanism not only speed up the generation but also enhances
    the smoothness and view consistency of the synthesized 3D objects. Our experiments
    covering 5 textto-3D and 3 image-to-3D models, demonstrate Hash3D''s versatility
    to speed up optimization, enhancing efficiency by 1.3 ∼ 4×. Additionally, Hash3D''s
    integration with 3D Gaussian splatting largely speeds up 3D model creation, reducing
    text-to-3D processing to about 10 minutes and image-to-3D conversion to roughly
    30 seconds. The code is provided in https://github.com/Adamdad/hash3D. Area and
    Power Efficient Implementation of Configurable Ring Oscillator PUF Enas Abulibdeh
    and 4 more April 02, 2024 Physically Unclonable Function (PUF) is an emerging
    hardware security primitive that provides a promising solution for lightweight
    security. PUFs can be used to generate a secret key that depends on the random
    manufacturing process variation of the device for lightweight authentication and
    device identification. This work proposes an optimized version of the Configurable
    Ring Oscillator (CRO) PUF that aims to reduce power consumption and area overhead.
    The proposed design eliminates the duplication of ROs, reduces the switching activity,
    and introduces the inter-stage delay as an additional source of randomness. The
    proposed PUF has been implemented in 22nm FDSOI technology using the Synopsys
    tools. A comprehensive security analysis has been acquired utilizing Challenge-Response
    Pairs collected from 8 chips. Results show an average of 49.42%, 38.25%, 9.95%,
    and 45.5% for uniformity, diffuseness, reliability, and uniqueness, respectively.
    Compared with the state-of-the-art, the proposed design achieves an area and power
    reduction of 75% and 65.1%, respectively. With the proposed PUF delivering 10
    32 CRPs, it is classified as a strong PUF. Additionally, the proposed design passes
    NIST tests and achieves an average prediction accuracy of 67.1% of machine learning
    modeling. A Hero Or A Killer? Overview Of Opportunities, Challenges, And Implications

    model that can create videos based on simple user prompts. The model promises
    to revolutionize the way content is created. When SORA is released to the general
    public, it may transform a wide array of industries but also pose significant
    challenges and risks. This research aims to provide a comprehensive understanding
    of SORA''s opportunities, challenges, and implications. It explores its potential
    applications in film-making, education, gaming, advertising, accessibility, healthcare,
    and social media content creation. Additionally, it delves into its potential
    challenges and risks, including misinformation, privacy concerns, bias, regulatory
    complexities, and dependence on technology. This research provides important recommendations

    management utilises several data sources to make informed decisions and these
    sources are often overlooked during risk assessments for cyber threats. These
    data sources are coming from several critical systems which are responsible for
    keeping the daily operations of the facility running. Having a cyber attack on
    these systems, or even just manipulating the information in the data sources can
    have catastrophic impacts for the facility. Keeping the services running will
    ensure research efforts continue and minimise financial losses in the process.
    These systems include electrical bulk infrastructure, water management, biosafety
    labs, and physical security systems. This paper provides an overview of the system
    and is used to identify potential cyber security risks. A system is proposed to
    mitigate the risks while highlighting the need for cyber security training for
    all staff members. This includes making staff aware of social engineering attacks
    that may be used to gain access to the sensitive information that can be used

    Location: Salt Lake City, UT, USA SECTION I. Introduction Facilities management
    is highly dependent on data to make informed decisions to manage and maintain
    several systems effectively. These systems are critical to ensure operational
    up time is kept to a maximum. This is essential in an academic environment as
    research experiments can be in process and interruption can cause severe losses
    of research that may be years in the making. These systems are managed by the
    technical services department (TSD) and is responsible for multiple bulk services
    that includes electricity, backup electricity system and water. Building management
    systems (BMS) controls fresh air with heating and air conditioning (HVAC) systems
    for buildings as well as environment management for biosafety labs (BSL) also
    known as a cleanrooms. Physical security systems is the final area of responsibility
    to manage that includes CCTV, alarm systems, access control, fire detection and
    fire protection systems. All these systems have several interfaces that make them
    vulnerable to cyber attacks. The effective management of these systems can only
    be understood if the objective is clear on what they are intended to achieve while
    taking into account what disruption and damage it will cause if they are targeted
    by a cyber attack. Information governance is an initiative that intends to effectively
    manage information of systems and processes with protection of personal information
    confidentiality as the primary focus. This is a primary focus of the private information
    protection act (POPIA) compliance with the act coming in full effect on the 1st
    of July 2020 and may impose severe penalties imposed when data breaches occur
    [1]. The POPIA is implemented to ensure protection of personal and private information
    for South African citizens. The Greenwich University data breach received a 500
    000 GBP (Great British Pounds) fine under the European Union (EU) General Data
    Protection Regulation (GDPR) [2]. Figure 1 however shows that personal information
    is not the only focus of the information governance initiative with data integrity
    and availability as the second and third pillar of the initiative. These pillars
    are of utmost importance for the TSD as data needs to be available when needed
    without needing to waste time to search for the data as it will assist in quicker
    response times when interruptions do occur in the services. This information needs
    to be correct, with a high level of integrity, to ensure effective steps can be
    taken on interruptions. Malicious attacks on these system can be for direct service
    interruptions, data destruction, data delay, or simply a malicious hackers. These
    types of attacks are not limited to the day to day operations of a facility. These
    attacks can also be used on a larger scale to cripple a country’s during cyber
    warfare when targeting a countries critical infrastructure [3]. Facilities management
    also has the risk of being a target for potential attacks and currently does not
    have a drive to prepare for future attacks. Interruptions in the information received
    from these services can have severe financial impact through losses or service
    interruptions. This paper discusses the current system overview and operation
    in section II with the security risk and possible attack vectors in section III.
    Section IV discusses a proposed system to minimise attacks and minimise future
    risks while discussing the importance of staff training on cyber security and
    social engineering measurements. A future cost effective implementation plan is
    proposed to detect and mitigate potential attack vectors. Finally, Section V concludes
    this paper with a short summary and the direction of future work that is proposed.
    Fig. 1. Information governance pillars Show All SECTION II. Background Understanding
    the cyber security risk requires to critically analyse current system components.
    Background of the infrastructure will assist in knowing why these are critical
    infrastructure to manage with operating system, databases, and communication methods
    used for identifying the attack vectors into the systems. A. Electricity supply
    South Africa has been hit by a severe electrical shortage since 2008, with load
    shedding of the electricity supply becoming a norm during that time [4]. The cost
    of the electricity has increased by 350 % from 2007 - 2017 after the crisis started
    and inflation over the same period was only 74 % as seen in figure 2 [5]. South
    Africa has suffered severe impact of load shedding as recent as 2019 with the
    threat that loomed in June and July 2020 becoming a reality [6]. Load shedding
    is implemented on several stages dependent on the shortfall from the electricity
    provider with stage 4 being a common occurrence during 2019 that has 8 hours a
    day power outage split into 2 hour windows over the day [7], [8]. These interruptions
    will greatly impact any research conducted and day to day operations at the university.
    Generators are installed to supply electricity during these times to mitigate
    impact of power outages. Running cost of these generators are roughly 6 times
    higher than supplied electricity in diesel cost alone and does not include maintenance
    cost of the machines. Effective alerting on when power outages occur is needed
    to monitor if the generators correctly start up and similarly when power has returned,
    that the generator has switched off to minimise generator running cost. Running
    the generators also has an effect on carbon tax fees that gives further incentive
    to run the generators as short as possible [9], [10]. Fig. 2. Eskom electricity
    cost increase versus inflation (CPI) [5] Show All The first section to discuss
    is the electricity network monitoring system. Electricity loggers are installed
    over several University campuses at main substations and buildings. These loggers
    originally reported to an old outdated application server running Windows Server
    2003 with SQL Server 2005. Communication is initiated from the server to the loggers
    on a fixed time period to retrieve electrical usage of each site. A new generation
    of software is currently in development running on Windows Server 2016 and SQL
    Server 2018 with monitoring dashboards to see live readings while the communication
    to the loggers are still using the same method as the original system. The generator
    monitoring makes use of a Short Message Service (SMS) messaging protocol to send
    data to specific cellphone numbers and a base station. The data is displayed on
    a dashboard while storing the data in a database. Messages that are received have
    a wide range of information and a overview is displayed on a dashboard. These
    include general maintenance messages like low fuel and battery and charger related
    issues. The main messages of importance is the status of main power supply, changeover
    status to generator/mains, and generator start/stop messages. Reaction to the
    messages is primarily done from cellphone messages received but unfortunately
    a flood of messages can occur if a large area outage occurs as all generators
    will send status messages to the staff member’s cellphone. Fault detection becomes
    extremely difficult as the volume of messages received can easily ensure that
    a message is missed when a change over did not occur or a generator did not start
    correctly. Typically a change over failure from generator to mains will ensure
    that generators keep running after power has been restored at a much higher running
    cost compared to the municipal supply. B. Water management Water is a limited
    resource with a prediction that 40% of the world’s population will live in water-stressed
    areas by 2035 [11]–[13]. The available fresh water has reduced by 55% from the
    1960s and demand is projected to increase by an additional 50% by 2030 [11]. This
    has been financially equated to 500 billion US$ per annum due to water insecurity
    [11]. The United Nations (UN) has developed, due to this scarcity and projections,
    the Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG6) to work towards water security to the
    world that is affordable to the masses [13]. This water insecurity has been felt
    locally in South Africa as it is currently been affecting several of its provinces
    with drought. Cape Town was been declared a crisis zone with severe water restrictions
    to the urban communities of 50 litres of water per day [14], [15]. These severe
    restrictions have been introduced to assist in water supply to the communities
    and additional measures have been imposed to secure natural spring areas from
    water theft [15]. The fact unfortunately, is that around 30% of water is lost
    through leakage within distribution networks and the Durban area has losses of
    35% due to theft through illegal connections [12], [13]. Port Elizabeth has stated
    that 46% losses occur before it reaches its residences [16]. Reduction in these
    losses will assist in alleviating some of the stresses in the water supply. Water
    monitoring systems are implemented to detect losses from the clients’ water network
    to reduce usage through losses which in turn will reduce monthly bills as well
    [3]. Currently there are two monitoring systems installed at the University. The
    first is a SMS based system sending alerts on high water flows and low water pressures.
    Typically a high flow will occur with a severe water leak and low pressure when
    no water supply is present. Data is sent from installed monitoring equipment via
    SMS on a specific time interval which is currently set at 12 hours to limit data
    costs. This provides a historic overview but is problematic if real-time data
    is required to be analyse and detect small leaks. Smaller leaks typically do not
    pass the threshold setup that would trigger high flow alerts. Data can be displayed
    on a desktop application for historic flows and pressures of the sites across
    several of the campuses. The alerts require a fixed threshold value to be set
    that will send alerts. Currently the threshold is set based on the historic maximum
    flows of the specific site but does not take into account that leaks may be present
    in non peak hours with lower usage and will not be detected on the fixed threshold.
    The alarm functionality is a key feature used on this platform as the manual daily
    usage is labour intensive to analyse. The second system installed is used for
    usage monitoring with flow meters installed at over 300 sites across multiple
    campuses. These meters send data to a base station over radio frequency (RF) and
    then a GSM connection to the server. The data is stored in a MySQL database and
    viewable over a web-based system on hourly intervals. This system has a vast amount
    of information but requires manual intervention to view each site on the system
    to determine if there are irregularities in water usage as it does not have an
    alerting functionality. The large amount of sites and time required for analysis
    by a small team is inefficient. The authors have previously proposed to adapt
    the system to, firstly, construct a nightly leak flow report and email a report
    on the site flow rates during the hours of 00:00 and 05:00, when there should
    be no personnel on the site and is with high probability that the reading is a
    leak [3]. This is made possible by having access to the MySQL databases and further
    expansion is proposed for anomaly detection during all hours of the day by making
    use of access control and CCTV for occupancy detection while combining it with
    water usage [17]. C. Biosafety labs BSL control systems are essential to ensure
    proper operation within these labs. The research conducted in these clean-rooms
    have highly contagious pathogens while the control systems ensure a safe working
    environment while keeping the pathogens contained within the room. The labs are
    rated based on the potential lethality of the disease that may be worked on. Keeping
    it safe however requires control systems and strict processes to ensure the viruses
    are kept in the BSL and do not escape to the outside world. An extreme risk lies
    in the something can go wrong with these control systems and in severe cases cause
    an outbreak. The BSL makes use of a BMS that controls air flow by means of differential
    pressure and directional airflow to air into the lab between segregated zones
    with graphical demonstration in figure 3 [18]–[20]. Fine control is implemented
    to ensure that the air pressure is lower in the centre of the lab when compared
    to atmospheric pressure. This is done to ensure that potentially released pathogens
    will stay contained in the cleanroom. Manipulating the controls of the system
    may be used to reverse airflow and increase pressure inside the lab and thus reversing
    the safety mechanism and in turn potentially releasing pathogens to the outside
    world. The systems typically run on a private WiFi network to the control equipment,
    with a windows based system that is installed without further updating and security
    management of the system. Fig. 3. BSL design for differential pressure [19] Show
    All These labs have strict rules and guidelines on management procedures to limit
    unauthorised access. The World Health Organisation (WHO) and Centre for Disease
    Control (CDC) offering guidelines on how to manage the BSLs [21], [22]. Access
    control measures and CCTV are typical systems that assist in limiting unauthorised
    access to the labs while offering traceability if something may go wrong. Backup
    power supply in the form of a generator is also installed to ensure the control
    systems remains operational when power outages occur. D. Physical security Physical
    security systems are intended to detect intrusions into facilities while alerting
    if something is out of the norm. Unauthorised access can be to steal anything
    from cellphones, laptops, or exam papers as examples. These devices typically
    report to a security control room to monitor the current status and react when
    alarms are triggered. The University makes extensive use of access control at
    perimeter gates, building entrances, and restricted areas. Access to these areas
    are regulated with permissions and stored in a database before being distributed
    to the relevant access control nodes over a typical computer network. All the
    rights are managed through a web interface before storage into the database. The
    access control nodes report back to the main server and can be used to track historic
    movement in and out of location when a intrusion has occurred. Alarm systems are
    used to detect intrusions after forced entries occur. The system is typically
    set on a timer to activate after office hours and be deactivated by personnel
    when they arrive in office the next morning. Activated alarms report to the security
    control room for security personnel to react to the breaches and investigate the
    intrusion. The system also receives panic alarms and the intercoms from elevators
    if staff, students or visitors are stuck when a malfunction occurs. All these
    alerts are sent via the network and stored in an old Microsoft access database
    for analysis of the intrusions if needed. CCTV usage is common in many areas of
    the world and the University is no different. Implementation of the CCTV system
    is done with the objective to keep an eye on multiple campuses that is separated
    by quite a distance. There is around 3000 cameras situated over all the campuses
    that all communicate to individual recorders and is accessible over the network
    in the security control room. Future expansion is underway to have a more centralised
    system to streamline viewing and backup storage of a subsection of the recording
    devices while increasing operational efficiencies. Fire detection and protection
    systems are installed to firstly protect lives and secondly the protection of
    assets. Fire detection will send an alarm throughout a building if smoke, excess
    heat or manual alarms are triggered. Optionally the system will send the alarm
    to the security control room over the network and the authorities can be contacted
    to assist with firefighting. Fire protection by means of gas suppression is typically
    installed at key infrastructure sites such as data centres and sub stations to
    extinguish fires as they occur. These systems are typically not safe for humans
    and is therefore installed in areas that have less human occupancy and protects
    critical infrastructure to maintain business continuity after a fire occurs. Fire
    protection by means of water sprinklers are commonly installed in offices and
    warehouses to protect infrastructure but can damage content extensively with water
    damage. Understanding the systems building blocks will assist in identifying the
    weak points in the system that can be targeted in a cyber attack and is discussed
    in section III. SECTION III. Security risk and impact All of these systems concurrently
    running have common elements that can be targeted for a cyber attack. Network
    communication is a core part on all of these systems as all of them need to transfer
    data. Disruption of this network service can have a severe financial impact. The
    first potential cyber attack is thus a simple distributed denial-of-service (DDoS)
    attack on any of the installed field equipment or servers. Attacks on the RF,
    CCTV cameras, alarm systems, or control equipment will ensure that data losses
    occur. Interruption of these systems will cause anything from blind spots to allow
    intrusions, miss massive water leaks, miss electrical outages, or leave environments
    open for physical intrusions. Independent WiFi of these systems do not always
    fall under IT control so attacks and breaches will possibly not be detected if
    attacked or disrupted. Mobile communication over GSM or SMS may be unreliable
    and messages can be delayed and also have information loss. Most of these systems
    makes use of a web interface that can be targeted in an attack as it makes use
    of a database backend. These systems typically may have a vulnerability to SQL
    injection attacks that can either leak data from the database, inject their own
    data, or delete potentially some or all of the data in the database. The limitation
    of some of the systems being old makes them susceptible to these attacks as they
    have been discontinued with no further security updates. Operating systems that
    do not receive security updates may leave them just as vulnerable as the databases.
    The aging operating systems will have had time for known security flaws to become
    public and can directly be targeted in attacks on these outdated systems. Third
    party software may be designed without taking security into account can cause
    increased risks to the system. Control systems have been targeted directly with
    viruses and malware with Stuxnet specifically focused on PLC control systems.
    These attacks typically start by infecting a computer on the same network and
    then distributed to the control systems with devastating consequences. Altering
    operations of the control systems can have a devastating effect as reversing differential
    air pressure design of a BSL will ensure that potentially lethal virus containment
    fails. Cooling systems that malfunction will have a severe impact on hardware
    in data centres or temperature sensitive research as high temperatures will damage
    or destroy the hardware or research. The human element in these systems are often
    overlooked and can be exploited by making use of social engineering techniques.
    Social engineering is defined as \"the science of using social interaction as
    a means to persuade an individual or an organisation to comply with a specific
    request from an attacker where either the social interaction, the persuasion or
    the request involves a computer-related entity\" [23], [24]. As clearly stated
    by various authors [25]–[28], the human element is the ‘glitch’ or vulnerable
    element within security systems. This weakness can be exploited by various phishing
    schemes and email scams to appear legitimate while attempting to gain access to
    login information, network IPs, hardware locations, or rerouting of financial
    payments. Twitter was recently hacked by making use of a coordinated social engineering
    attack and this same method can be used on smaller enterprises [29]. The question
    now remains which techniques can be implemented to assist in mitigating the threats
    against these systems and a proposal is made in section IV. SECTION IV. Proposed
    system The overlap between the systems is clear that the same functional units
    exist even if the age of the systems may vary. Guidelines and best practices have
    been developed over the past decade to improve control systems cyber security
    [30], [31]. A wide variety of measures can be taken and include network segmentation,
    patch management, system monitoring, and awareness training to address the industrial
    control systems weak points [30]. A simplified overview of the functional units
    and interfaces is shown in figure 4. The physical systems have an interface (I/F
    1) by means of monitoring equipment. Equipment then transmits over a network system
    (I/F 2) to a server and stored into a database. Backend analysis is where the
    proposed system has most of the focus. Network traffic analysis on the monitoring
    equipment and servers can assist in detecting a DDoS attacks [32]. These attacks
    are hopefully minimised as the servers are either in a controlled network space
    with no public facing IPs. Attack threats can thus still be from the internal
    enterprise network on the servers if the rules are not enforced and correctly
    managed. Private WiFi on some of the control systems are however still open for
    attacks and intrusion detection will greatly assist in attacks on the control
    and monitoring equipment. Simply ensuring WiFi SSID is hidden will decrease some
    of the risk that these stand-alone control systems have. An additional step can
    be taken to separate critical systems from the network virtually by making a demilitarized
    zone (DMZ) or different VLANs. This will segregate the network in a manner so
    that specific computers can only access the essential systems and limit attack
    attempts as the computers are not visible on the standard enterprise network.
    Data received from monitoring equipment that is on a fixed time interval can be
    monitored. Analysing the influx of data received on these specific time intervals
    will assist that loss of data is detected much earlier when compared to a small
    team needing to analyse all the data manually. An alert (I/F 4) can be set up
    and sent to relevant staff to investigate monitoring equipment power supply, monitoring
    equipment damage, or network communication when data interruption is detected.
    This alert can easily be sent to a Telegram group by making use of their bot API
    without the need of manual intervention. Cyber security education is an item that
    should be mandatory in every organisation. There is no way we could expect individuals
    to stay vigilant if they do not even know the basics of technology and the attacks
    that may happen on physical systems or the human element [33], [34]. Education
    is at the heart of this problem and mandatory employee training is essential to
    inform them how protect themselves against these attacks. This can be a challenge
    when taking into account that staff education ranges from non-computer literate
    all the way to post graduate level. A campaign thus needs to be designed not only
    to cater to computer literate staff but also non-computer literate staff. Penetration
    testing of systems can provide valuable insight to the weaknesses currently present.
    Identified weaknesses can be used to modify the system to mitigate the risks and
    improve the security posture of the environment. By implementing scheduled security
    assessments and addressing the findings adequately, one can ensure the security
    posture of the environment is maintained. These tests can be outsourced to white
    hat hacker companies or internal staff can be upskilled and trained to do the
    penetration testing for the enterprise. A. Initial implementation plan This is
    a conceptual design and will need to be investigated to determine the extent to
    which the systems are vulnerable to potential attacks. Several open source packages
    are available that can be used to test for vulnerabilities in these systems. Reports
    generated from open source software packages can be used as a motivation tool
    for budget request for system improvements or system upgrades. Some immediate
    mitigation actions can be implemented without investing too many resources at
    a minimum or no financial cost. Server downtime is becoming more frequent due
    to rolling blackouts in South Africa. The servers are configured to auto restart
    and a simple script is implemented to alert staff to check that all software and
    services are indeed running. Data entry count is currently implemented on the
    daily leak flow reports and can be adapted with slight code alterations to be
    used during all hours of the day with notifications to the alerting platform on
    data interruptions. Zabbix uptime monitoring is currently being implemented on
    network equipment to notify on downtime and alerts sent to investigate the outage.
    The load shedding however does cause a false negative alarm with power outages
    and longer alerting time periods are required to ensure a flood of alarms aren’t
    received on every load shedding occurrence. Open source DDoS detection system
    are available for a proof of concept deployment to detect attacks with internal
    penetration testing on the systems. Most of the network based attacks can be minimised

    V. Conclusion Facilities management is often overlooked when performing risk assessments.
    Entities running several systems have a massive threat landscape that need to
    be monitored for cyber attacks. Information received from monitoring equipment
    ensures that decisions can be made to keep critical infrastructure functional.
    These include electrical systems, water management systems, BSL, and physical
    security systems. This paper discusses the systems currently installed with an
    overview of the backend systems that are used to monitor operations. The risks
    has been identified with proposed systems to be implemented to mitigate the risks.
    A current cost effective implementation plan is proposed to ensure quick testing
    of the systems vulnerabilities. This paper highlights the fact that cyber security
    training is an essential part in any organisation to ensure staff understands
    the attack vectors that can be used to gain access to the systems. Authors Figures

    Communications and Sensing for 6G and Beyond: A Comprehensive Review Wei Jiang
    and 14 more April 04, 2024 Next-generation cellular technologies, commonly referred
    to as the sixth generation (6G), are envisioned to support a higher system capacity,
    better performance, and network sensing capabilities. The terahertz (THz) band
    is one potential enabler to this end due to the large unused frequency bands and
    the high spatial resolution enabled by the short signal wavelength and large bandwidth.
    Different from earlier surveys, this paper presents a comprehensive treatment
    and technology survey on THz communications and sensing in terms of advantages,
    Rapid Feasibility Assessment of Energy Unit Integration in Distribution Networks
    Sicheng Gong and 2 more April 03, 2024 In contemporary heavy-load distribution
    networks, preceding feasibility assessment is imperative before incorporating
    additional energy units. However, the feasibility examination for massive combined
    operational scenarios of relevant units is computationally intensive with repetitive
    power flow calculations. To this end, this paper proposes a rapid assessment framework,
    the kernel of which is to learn from formerly examined scenarios, thus forming
    expansive feasible/infeasible regions to geometrically rule in/out subsequent
    scenarios. Without running the power flow computation in most scenarios, we accelerate
    the assessment process. Moreover, enlightened by heuristic hypersurface search,
    such prechecking efficiency can be further boosted. In a risk-averse manner, this
    framework can be conceptualized using the exact grid model. Especially, evidenced
    by testing on a 10.5kV distribution grid, the framework shows a significant assessment
    efficiency improvement and strict accuracy guarantee, where we observe at least
    76.13% assessment time reduction and zero accuracy loss in all testing cases.
    We anticipate this work to be a starting point for more sophisticated geometry-accelerating
    feasibility assessment methods. Improving Molecular De Novo Drug Design with Transformers
    Dhaval Soni and 7 more April 03, 2024 Drug design is undergoing a transformation
    as we challenge conventional methods by integrating state-of-the-art artificial
    intelligence with the intricate domain of molecular biology. At the heart of our
    endeavor lies a significant challenge: the scarcity of datasets containing active
    compounds for emerging target proteins. To confront this obstacle, we''re pioneering
    an innovative approach. We''re merging the advanced Generative Pre-trained Transformer
    (GPT) architecture with the nuanced capabilities of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
    networks, with the aim of generating Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System
    (SMILES) strings to unveil novel therapeutic pathways. Additionally, we''re employing
    a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) pretraining strategy
    to enrich our model with comprehensive molecular data, including amino acid sequences
    and molecular SMILES datasets. Through meticulous fine-tuning on a meticulously
    curated protein-ligand complex dataset, we''re achieving precise conditional generation
    via autoregressive supervised learning. Our research introduces a groundbreaking
    method to assess molecular affinity, validated against established proteins, showcasing
    superior binding affinities compared to certain FDA-approved drugs in docking
    experiments. By pushing the boundaries of generative algorithms and establishing
    a robust framework for evaluating molecular affinity, we''re driving forward the
    field of de novo drug design, offering promising therapeutic avenues and enabling
    deeper exploration of the chemical landscape. Formalising a Gateway-based Blockchain

    A document by Guzman Llambias . Click on the document to view its contents. Magnetic
    Behavior of NO Fe-Si Sheets under Tensile and Compressive Stress Carlo Appino
    and 6 more April 03, 2024 The stress dependence of the magnetic properties of
    non-oriented Fe-Si steel sheets has been investigated by measurement and analysis
    of hysteresis loop, magnetization curve, and energy losses taken at different
    peak polarization values Jp (0.5 T – 1.5 T) between DC and f = 400 Hz. The salient
    feature of the material response to the stress lies in the monotonic deterioration
    of the soft magnetic properties, across the whole (Jp - f) domain, on passing
    from the maximum tensile stress (σ = +30 MPa) to the maximum compression (σ =
    -30 MPa). This is understood in terms of stress-induced redistribution of the
    domains between easy axes, making magnetic hardening by compression directly related
    to unfavorably directed domains and 90° domain-wallmediated magnetization transitions.
    The loss decomposition is carried out across the whole investigated frequency
    range, taking into account the skin effect at the highest frequencies. Quasi-static
    and dynamic losses follow a same trend with σ, both monotonically increasing on
    passing from the tensile to the compressive stress limits, according to the theoretically
    expected relationship existing between the hysteresis and the excess loss components.
    The latter is shown to identify the correlation regions where the magnetization
    is reversed of size comparable with the average grain size and loosely following
    the dependence of the loss figure on the applied stress. A bio-inspired hardware
    implementation of an analog spike-based hippocampus memory mo... Daniel Casanueva-Morato
    and 4 more April 03, 2024 The need for processing at the edge the increasing amount
    of data that is being produced by multitudes of sensors has led to the demand
    for mode power efficient computational systems, by exploring alternative computing
    paradigms and technologies. Neuromorphic engineering is a promising approach that
    can address this need by developing electronic systems that faithfully emulate
    the computational properties of animal brains. In particular, the hippocampus
    stands out as one of the most relevant brain region for implementing auto associative
    memories capable of learning large amounts of information quickly and recalling
    it efficiently. In this work, we present a computational spike-based memory model
    inspired by the hippocampus that takes advantage of the features of analog electronic
    circuits: energy efficiency, compactness, and real-time operation. This model
    can learn memories, recall them from a partial fragment and forget. It has been
    implemented as a Spiking Neural Networks directly on a mixed-signal neuromorphic
    chip. We describe the details of the hardware implementation and demonstrate its
    operation via a series of benchmark experiments, showing how this research prototype
    paves the way for the development of future robust and low-power mixed-signal
    neuromorphic processing systems. Exploratory Study of oneM2M-based Interoperability
    Architectures for IoT: A Smart Cit... VJS Pranavasri and 6 more April 03, 2024
    The advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) has ushered in transformative possibilities
    for smart cities, with the potential to revolutionize urban living through enhanced
    connectivity and data-driven decision-making. However, the effective realization
    of IoT in smart cities hinges upon the seamless interoperability of diverse devices
    and systems. To address this critical need, the oneM2M standards initiative has
    emerged as a foundational framework for IoT interoperability. In this research
    paper, we perform an exploratory analysis of three prominent open-source oneM2M
    based interoperability systems-Mobius, OM2M, and ACME. We leverage an existing
    large-scale system provided by our Smart City Living Lab deployed at IIIT Hyderabad,
    sprawling a 66-acre campus featuring over 370 nodes across eight verticals. We
    investigate the architectural characteristics of each solution, considering their
    strengths and limitations in facilitating IoT interoperability. Through this analysis,
    our paper aims to provide valuable insights for stakeholders seeking to implement
    IoT interoperability solutions in the context of smart cities. By evaluating the
    strengths and limitations of Mobius, OM2M, and ACME, we seek to offer guidance
    for selecting the most suitable solution. Our analysis reveals that the optimal
    framework choice depends on specific quality constraints: Mobius excels in performance,
    while ACME offers advantages in ease of setup for smaller-scale implementations.
    Comparing Concepts of Service Blocking Queues in Hardware-in-the-Loop Systems
    Tobias Konheiser and 3 more April 03, 2024 ZF is developing an autonomous driving
    system, which requires extensive testing of the developed devices and software
    on hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) systems. Therefore, a robust and high-performing
    HIL system is essential. The purpose of a HIL system is to replay recorded data
    to the device-undertest. Recordings are loaded, processed and streamed to the
    deviceunder-test with real-time requirements. This streaming chain includes processing
    nodes and queues. This requires careful management of queue configurations. An
    overflow in the queue will result in packet loss, while an underflow may violate
    the real-time constraint. This study aims to develop and evaluate concepts for
    service blocking queues. These concepts block or pause the incoming service to
    a queue when necessary to avoid queue overflows and associated data loss. However,
    an out-of-the-box solution is not available and different approaches affect the
    behaviour and performance of the system. Therefore, the developed concepts are
    evaluated against each other and against the existing system based on selected
    performance parameters in specific scenarios. The scenarios cover a wide range
    of situations, reflecting standard input data with varying numbers of parallel
    streams and bottleneck scenarios forcing queue overflows or blockages. The developed
    service blocking queue concepts eliminate data loss in all scenarios, but introduce
    overhead, resulting in reduced system performance. However, the service blocking
    queue concept using a modified token-bucket approach proved to be the best solution,
    as the elimination of data loss justifies the additional overhead. This concept
    is proposed for implementation and deployment on the HIL system. Generative AI-Based
    Text Generation Methods Using Pre-Trained GPT 2 Model Rohit Pandey and 7 more
    April 03, 2024 A text generation model is a machine learning model that uses neural
    networks, especially transformers architecture to generate contextually relevant
    text based on linguistic patterns learned from extensive corpora. The models are
    trained on a huge amount of textual data so that they can model and learn complex
    concepts of any language like its grammar, vocabulary, phrases, and styles. FlowDep
    - An efficient and optical-flow-based algorithm of obstacle detection for aut...
    Chen-Fu Yeh and 7 more April 03, 2024 Obstacle detection is crucial for the safety
    and efficiency of autonomous vehicles. For mini-vehicles such as palm-sized drones,
    it is a challenge to implement traditional methods like Lidar due to high costs
    and physical constraints. Vision-based deep learning approaches, while accurate,
    are too resource-intensive for the mini-vehicles. To address this issue, we introduce
    Flowdep, a novel optical-flow-based algorithm inspired by the low-resolution but
    efficient motion-detection mechanisms in insects. Flowdep combines optic flow
    and IMU (or positioning information) to estimate the depth of every image pixel.
    We also generate a variant of Flowdep using the artificial neural network (Flowdep-ANN).
    Our tests show that Flowdep and Flowdep-ANN are 5.8 to 114.7 times faster than
    the DNN networks we tested, while the accuracies of Flowdep and Flowdep-ANN are
    on par with these networks. We further tested Flowdep and Flowdep-ANN on a small
    autonomous vehicle with Raspberry Pi4 as the computing platform, and both models
    successfully performed real-time object detection. The present work demonstrates
    the potential of using optical flow as an efficient approach to estimate depth
    and detect obstacles in resource-constrained mini-vehicles. Misinformative Data
    Visualizations in the Sports Media Domain Drew Scott April 03, 2024 Sports are
    data-driven: individual performances are measured using statistics and teams leverage
    data analytics to outperform competition. Sports media-which is created by media
    outlets, teams, and individuals-engage its consumers by creating narratives about
    the sport, teams, and players. Due to the importance of data in the sports world,
    data visualizations are a pillar in the sports media landscape. These data visualizations,
    while appearing to accurately convey data to its consumers, can be misinformative;
    media creators often have incentives to present specific narratives which don''t
    always fit the data. This work contributes to an existing misinformative data
    visualization taxonomy. In doing so, it makes it easier to understand the techniques
    and design choices used to create misinformative visualizations in all domains,
    not only in sports media. A Survey of RFID Authentication Protocols Drew Scott
    April 03, 2024 "Radio frequency identification" (RFID) systems are ubiquitous
    in today''s world. In an RFID system, it is a desirable to attain mutual authentication
    between a reader and a tag before commencing application-level communications.
    This is because tags should not share secret information with unknown parties
    and readers need to defend against tag impersonation. Authentication protocols
    designed for communication between computers, however, are not appropriate for
    RFID systems because tags are extremely resource constrained (low energy, small
    memory, etc.). Thus, there have been many attempts to design secure and practical
    authentication protocols for RFID systems over the years since RFID systems became
    prevalent. This survey summarizes and compares these protocols. The Effect of
    Multipath in Distributed Arrays with Time Reversal Hassna Ouassal and 2 more April
    03, 2024 This article examines the effect of multipath channels on the performance
    of distributed arrays that employ time reversal. A model of the signal received
    from a distributed array is formulated, and a statistical analysis of the variation
    in signal power in the presence of phase noise and multipath is given. We present
    the impact these nonidealities have on received signal power, and we analyze the
    received power for three specific cases: continuous waveform, impulse waveform,
    and modulated rectangular pulse waveform in the presence of standard channel models.
    It is shown that for larger arrays in multipath channels, the change in power
    between coherent and incoherent states converges to the line-of-sight channel.
    It is further shown that in a line-of-sight channel time-reversal completely cancels
    unknown channel delays resulting in coherent signals from all nodes in a distributed
    array, while in a multipath channel only the main diagonal round-trip paths are
    coherent. Nevertheless, this additional benefit improves signal coherence in complex
    channels and can aide in distributed array synchronization using two-way time
    transfer. Disproof of Hodge Conjecture by Graph Theory Jihyeon Yoon April 02,
    2024 Hodge conjecture is turned out to be false in extension of graph theory based
    on its algebraic attribute. Hash3D: Training-free Acceleration for 3D Generation
    Xingyi Yang and 1 more April 02, 2024 The evolution of 3D generative modeling
    has been notably propelled by the adoption of 2D diffusion models. Despite this
    progress, the cumbersome optimization process per se presents a critical hurdle
    to efficiency. In this paper, we introduce Hash3D, a universal acceleration for
    3D generation without model training. Central to Hash3D is the insight that feature-map
    redundancy is prevalent in images rendered from camera positions and diffusion
    time-steps in close proximity. By effectively hashing and reusing these feature
    maps across neighboring timesteps and camera angles, Hash3D substantially prevents
    redundant calculations, thus accelerating the diffusion model''s inference in
    3D generation tasks. We achieve this through an adaptive grid-based hashing. Surprisingly,
    this feature-sharing mechanism not only speed up the generation but also enhances
    the smoothness and view consistency of the synthesized 3D objects. Our experiments
    covering 5 textto-3D and 3 image-to-3D models, demonstrate Hash3D''s versatility
    to speed up optimization, enhancing efficiency by 1.3 ∼ 4×. Additionally, Hash3D''s
    integration with 3D Gaussian splatting largely speeds up 3D model creation, reducing
    text-to-3D processing to about 10 minutes and image-to-3D conversion to roughly
    30 seconds. The code is provided in https://github.com/Adamdad/hash3D. Area and
    Power Efficient Implementation of Configurable Ring Oscillator PUF Enas Abulibdeh
    and 4 more April 02, 2024 Physically Unclonable Function (PUF) is an emerging
    hardware security primitive that provides a promising solution for lightweight
    security. PUFs can be used to generate a secret key that depends on the random
    manufacturing process variation of the device for lightweight authentication and
    device identification. This work proposes an optimized version of the Configurable
    Ring Oscillator (CRO) PUF that aims to reduce power consumption and area overhead.
    The proposed design eliminates the duplication of ROs, reduces the switching activity,
    and introduces the inter-stage delay as an additional source of randomness. The
    proposed PUF has been implemented in 22nm FDSOI technology using the Synopsys
    tools. A comprehensive security analysis has been acquired utilizing Challenge-Response
    Pairs collected from 8 chips. Results show an average of 49.42%, 38.25%, 9.95%,
    and 45.5% for uniformity, diffuseness, reliability, and uniqueness, respectively.
    Compared with the state-of-the-art, the proposed design achieves an area and power
    reduction of 75% and 65.1%, respectively. With the proposed PUF delivering 10
    32 CRPs, it is classified as a strong PUF. Additionally, the proposed design passes
    NIST tests and achieves an average prediction accuracy of 67.1% of machine learning
    modeling. A Hero Or A Killer? Overview Of Opportunities, Challenges, And Implications

    Get rights and content Abstract Drones have recently become one of the most important
    technological breakthroughs. They have opened the horizon for a vast array of
    applications and paved the way for a diversity of innovative solutions. Integrating
    drones with the Internet has led to the emergence of a new paradigm named the
    Internet of Drones (IoD). Several works dealt with the security of the IoD, and
    various surveys have been published on this topic over the past few years. The
    existing surveys either have limited scope or offer partial coverage of cybersecurity
    countermeasures. To address these gaps, in this paper, we provide a comprehensive
    survey related to the cyber and physical security of IoD. Differently from many
    surveys that only provide a classification of attacks/threats, we also propose
    three taxonomies that are related to (1) the assets of drones, (2) attacks, and
    (3) countermeasures. The first taxonomy is a two-level classification of the assets
    in the IoD. The first level considers the coarse-grained assets, which refer to
    the IoD''s tangible elements, and the second level considers the fine-grained
    assets, which refer to the elements composing the coarse-grained assets. Based
    on the asset classification, we propose a taxonomy of attacks targeting the coarse
    and fine-grained assets, which allows a finer level of granularity to identify
    threats, and thus ensure better security. Also, we evaluate the risk of cyber
    and physical attacks by introducing a novel concept, named Chain of Impact, which
    connects four types of impacts, namely, Direct, Mission, Drone, and Environment.
    We propose a taxonomy of technical and non-technical countermeasures according
    to two implementation phases: Pre-incident, and Post-incident (or recovery). The
    pre-incident countermeasures are further classified as: preventive and detective.
    In addition, we present the countermeasures along with their performance and limitations.
    Finally, open research challenges are identified and ranked according to the level
    of attention they should receive from the research community. Also, future research
    directions and suggestions are presented for the security of the IoD. Previous

    assessmentCountermeasure 1. Introduction The Internet of Drones (IoD) has recently
    emerged as a new paradigm where a set of flying vehicles/devices communicate among
    themselves with a Ground Control Station (GCS) using the Internet to perform a
    variety of tasks in different domains, such as disaster management, smart agriculture,
    environmental monitoring, surveillance, military, smart city management, healthcare,
    and more recently, controlling the COVID-19 pandemic [28], [161]. For instance,
    some companies like Amazon adopted drones in their delivery systems, which helps
    them in ensuring fast delivery of parcels and lightweight freights and increasing
    the delivery rates. The IoD can also be used in rescue operations by delivering
    medical supplies and goods to people in remote and isolated areas. In precision
    agriculture, farmers can make real-time decisions based on data collected from
    drones. IoD has helped decrease the spread of COVID-19 infection by quickly delivering
    protective equipment and transporting the blood tests to laboratories. In general,
    the IoD offers reduced costs, time-efficiency, and high coverage surveillance
    and monitoring operations. Fig. 1 presents different application domains of IoD.

    Fig. 1. Application domains of IoD. According to the Federal Aviation Administration
    (FAA), [261], more than 900,000 drones were registered in the USA in August 2021.
    This number is continuously increasing due to the variety of benefits the IoD
    brings. As the IoD is utilized in different application domains, it has been targeted
    by attackers to cause harm to cyberspace, drones, people, and properties. The
    drones could be the target of an attack, or a means to perpetrate attacks and
    crimes. Therefore, the research community has paid increasing attention to IoD
    security, how to manage it securely, and address the cyber and physical attacks
    targeting them. The deployment of IoD encompasses several challenges, particularly
    concerning the safety of operations. Several issues must be considered when deploying
    networked drones over the Internet. For example, a loss of connectivity may lead
    to fatalities. Furthermore, the drones'' communication and networking system is
    heavily exposed to cyber security attacks and threats, which may result in disasters
    if not adequately addressed. In this survey, we address the above challenges and
    discuss their countermeasures. Furthermore, we present a comprehensive overview
    of the IoD, starting from the drone system itself, and going through the different
    architectural models, applications, requirements, communication systems, and cloud
    integration. In the literature, there are some surveys [14], [21], [62], [64],
    [110], [141], [173], [193], [307], [318], [325] that cover different aspects of
    IoD security. However, most of the surveys are short or restricted to a single
    security sub-topic. Others do not cover countermeasures or physical security.
    These gaps have motivated us to propose a more comprehensive survey on IoD security.
    Differently, this survey covers the cyber and physical security of the IoD, assesses
    the risks, and proposes three fine-grained taxonomies that are related to (1)
    components of drones (i.e., assets), (2) attacks, and (3) countermeasures. It
    assesses the cyber and physical risks of the IoD. It also provides a more comprehensive
    review by covering novel security topics such as operating system security. In
    particular, the main contributions of our survey are the following: 1. We present
    existing IoD-related surveys that cover several areas, including communication,
    cyber-physical systems (CPS), path planning, optimization, flight control, and
    security. Moreover, we compare the previous IoD security surveys and outline the
    key novelties of our survey. 2. We propose a two-level classification of the components
    in the IoD. The first level considers the coarse-grained assets, which refer to
    the IoD''s tangible elements, and the second level considers the fine-grained
    assets, which refer to the elements composing the coarse-grained assets. This
    classification allows a finer level of granularity to identify threats; hence,
    better security can be ensured. 3. Based on the asset classification, we propose
    an attack taxonomy that considers the cyber and physical attacks targeting the
    coarse-grained and fine-grained assets. 4. We evaluate the risk of cyber and physical
    attacks, by introducing a novel concept, named Chain of impact that connects four
    types of impacts, i.e., Direct, Mission, Drone, and Environment. 5. We propose
    a taxonomy of countermeasures according to two implementation phases: Pre-incident,
    and Post-incident (or recovery). The pre-incident countermeasures are further
    classified as preventive and detective. We provide better coverage of countermeasures
    by describing them and analyzing their strengths and limitations. We also cover
    novel topics, such as operating system security. 6. We identify ranked research
    challenges and recommend future research directions. The survey structure is shown
    in Fig. 2. The rest of the survey paper is organized as follows: In Section 2,
    we present non-security and security-focused related surveys on IoD and identify
    the main differences with our survey. Section 3 provides an overview of the IoD.
    Section 4 presents the two-level asset-based and attack-based taxonomies and the
    cyber and physical risks that could affect the different components of the IoD.
    In Section 5, we provide a taxonomy of countermeasures and describe the different
    techniques. Section 6 identifies open issues and recommends some suggestions and
    future research directions. Finally, Section 7 concludes this survey. Download

    Structure of the survey. 2. Related surveys In the literature, several surveys
    have covered various areas of IoD. Table 1 presents the different IoD surveys,
    and their corresponding focused research areas. Many surveys focused on communication
    and networking [34], [92], [102], [111], [130], [206], [258], [339], and flight
    control [150], [168], [169], [280], [332], [345]. Some surveys paid attention
    to cyber-physical aspects [272], [310], channel modeling and identification [142],
    [159], [327], path planning, mobility, and trajectory mining [101], [103], [219],
    [324], [346], traffic monitoring [133], vision, and target identification [66],
    [131], [178], optimization [47], [52], [227], and collaboration [19], [60], [312].
    The rest of the surveys [41], [160], [204], [220], [273] were not limited to a
    specific area, but they either covered different areas or provided a general overview
    of the IoD. Table 1. Non-security surveys on Internet of drones. Research topic

    find some surveys in the literature that cover different aspects of IoD security.
    As shown in Table 2, we classify the IoD security surveys concerning the following
    criteria: • Taxonomy: It indicates whether the survey provided a taxonomy that
    organizes and classifies the state-of-the-art into different categories. In general,
    a taxonomy could help the research community better understand a research topic,
    identify issues at a high level of granularity, and guide future research efforts.
    • Cyber security: It indicates whether the survey considered the cyber security
    aspect of IoD. • Physical security: It indicates whether the survey considered
    the physical security aspect of IoD. • Risk assessment: It indicates whether the
    survey provides an assessment of risks against IoD. This assessment helps identify
    the risks that require more attention from academia and the industry community.
    • Countermeasure: It indicates whether the survey presented countermeasures to
    protect the IoD. • Open issues & future directions: It indicates whether the survey
    discussed open issues and provided recommendations for future research. • Observation:
    It states any observations related to the survey. Table 2. Security-focused surveys

    privacy, and safety regulations of drones for smart city applications. Altawy
    et al. [21] described the cyber and physical threats to civilian drones. They
    also identified the corresponding security field for each threat that should be
    adopted, as well as research challenges and future research directions. He et
    al. [110] presented a short overview of threats and countermeasures related to
    IoD. Choudhary et al. [62] proposed a taxonomy to classify attacks with respect
    to the compromised security property, including confidentiality, integrity, availability,
    privacy, and trust. In [64], a short survey on intrusion detection systems (IDSs)
    in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) environments is presented. The authors proposed
    a taxonomy to classify the state-of-the-art IDSs according to different criteria:
    (a) information-gathering sources (i.e., sensors, communication links, GCS, UAV),
    (b) deployment strategies (i.e., ground-coordinated and autonomous), (c) detection
    methods (i.e., specification, signature, and anomaly-based), (d) detection states
    (i.e., on-site and off-site), (e) IDS acknowledgment (i.e., instant and periodic
    acknowledgment), and (f) intrusion types (i.e., malware, message forgery, routing
    attacks, etc.). The authors also provided research challenges and future research
    directions for IDS in the UAV environment. Lin et al. [173] presented security
    solutions against some attacks, such as privacy leakage (i.e., identity and location),
    forward and backward security, insider attacks, and untrusted cloud service providers.
    Kharchenko et al. [141] analyzed and assessed the network vulnerability of IoD
    using the Intrusion Modes and Effects Criticality Analysis (IMECA) technique.
    Each vulnerability is assessed according to the occurrence probability and severity.
    In [318], authentication protocols for IoD are presented and compared with ensured
    security properties, communication cost, and computational cost. Open research
    challenges in the field of IoD authentication are identified. Yaacoub et al. [325]
    presented the threats that target drone systems and the threats that could arise
    from using drones to commit crimes and damage the physical environment. They also
    gave their countermeasures and proposed recommendations to improve drone security.
    Alladi et al. [14] surveyed many blockchain applications in UAV networks. Although
    security is not the main topic of this survey, the authors presented the different
    scenarios where blockchain can be used to secure UAV networks. Mehta et al. [193]
    focused on security issues in UAVs with a 5G communication network. They classified
    the security issues with respect to compromised security property, including authentication,
    privacy, integrity, and availability. They also presented blockchain-based security
    solutions in UAVs and proposed future research directions toward integrating blockchain
    with 5G-enabled UAV networks. Yahuza et al. [326] classified the attacks against
    drone systems into two major categories: attacks that lead to localization errors
    of drones and attacks targeting security and privacy requirements. The attacks
    of the second category are further classified into subcategories with respect
    to integrity, availability, confidentiality, authenticity, and privacy. The authors
    also presented mitigation countermeasures for each attack subcategory. 2.1. Comparison
    with related surveys Most of the IoD security surveys are short [110], [141],
    [173], [307], or restricted to one security sub-topic such as IDS [62], authentication
    [318], and blockchain [14], [193], and some surveys do not present countermeasures
    [62], [141]. Our survey differs from the earlier-mentioned works in the following
    points: • Novel taxonomies: Differently from many surveys that only provide a
    classification of attacks/threats, our survey proposes three taxonomies that are
    related to (1) components of drones (i.e., assets), (2) attacks, and (3) countermeasures.
    The proposed taxonomies allow a finer level of granularity for asset identification,
    which permits broader identification of possible attacks, and determines where
    to implement the countermeasures at the fine-grained level. It also determines
    when to implement the countermeasures. • Risk assessment: There are no surveys
    that provide risk assessment related to IoD, except for [62], which presents a
    partial assessment by only considering the impact of threats. This assessment
    is based on a new concept called chain of impact. It aims to help researchers
    from academia and industrial communities identify the risks that require more
    attention and stronger countermeasures. • More coverage of countermeasures: We
    provide a more comprehensive survey than the related surveys regarding countermeasures.
    Only two surveys consider physical security [21], [325]. The same surveys [21],
    [325] only give a summary description of the countermeasure solutions. On the
    other hand, our survey presents the technical and non-technical countermeasures
    covering the three cybersecurity layers, i.e., preventive, detective, and recovery.
    It also discusses the solutions and presents their limitations. • Operating system
    security: Our survey is the first one that discusses the security aspects of drones''
    operating systems. • Ranked open issues: This survey is the first one that provides
    a ranking, which prioritizes the open issues in the IoD that require attention
    from the research community. It defines three priority and ranking levels, i.e.,
    high, medium, and low. 3. Overview of Internet of drones 3.1. Physical structure
    of a drone An unmanned aerial system is composed of a rigid body called a frame,
    and multiple motors are attached to this frame to generate the required thrust
    to lift the system in the air. There are different types of drones, depending
    on the number of motors attached to them, as shown in Fig. 3. • Tricopter: It
    has three motors, where two motors are brushless, and one is a servo motor. The
    brushless motors are typically used in small UAVs, and they are called so because
    they have no brushes in their commutator. They have higher efficiency as compared
    to brushed motors. The servo motor is a device that has an internal encoder, which
    allows converting any motion into a digital signal. The role of the servo motor
    in the Tricopter is to control the orientation (i.e., yaw) of the UAV. They present
    the advantage of being low-cost but are less reliable and robust than the other
    types. • Quadcopter: It is the most common type of drone and has four brushless
    motors attached to each of its four wings and deviated by 90 degrees from each
    other. There are two possible configurations: (i) Quad-X, where the front direction
    of the UAV is in the middle of the two front motors, and (ii) Quad-Plus, where
    the forward direction of the UAV is looking at the first motor of the quadcopter,
    as illustrated in Fig. 3. The motors rotate either in a clockwise direction (CW)
    or a counter-clockwise direction (CCW). For the Quad-X, the top-left and right-bottom
    motors must rotate in CCW, and the top-right and left-bottom motors must rotate
    in CW. Quad-X configuration is preferred for First Person View (FPV) applications
    because it provides a better camera view. • Hexacopter: It has six motors attached
    to its frame. The angle between two consecutive wings is 60 degrees. This model
    has the advantage of providing 50% more thrust than a quadcopter model, thanks
    to its other two motors, but at the expense of higher energy dissipation from
    the two extra motors. This allows to carry heavier payloads and ensures a more
    reliable flight due to the redundancy but results in a 35% reduction of the flight
    time using the same battery as a quadcopter model. It also has two possible configurations:
    Hex-X and Hex-Plus. • Octocopter: The Ocotocoper model has eight motors attached
    to its frame. The angle between two consecutive wings is 45 degrees. It is used
    for heavy payloads, such as carrying water tanks in smart agriculture or firefighting
    scenarios. This model is highly reliable as it can tolerate the power of any two
    non-consecutive motors without losing the ability to fly. It is also suitable
    for aerial photography. The Ocotocoper model is substantially more expensive than
    all other frame models due to the cost of extra motors and higher-capacity batteries.
    It also consumes much more energy due to the extra motors and the heavier weight.
    Similar to Quadcopters and Hexacopters, Octocopters can also be configured as
    Oct-X and Oct-Plus. Download : Download high-res image (325KB) Download : Download

    of drones This section presents the concept and architecture of IoD and its main
    components. The objective is to provide the reader with the general technical
    background to understand the different actors in an IoD ecosystem. In [99], the
    authors presented a generic abstract architecture that can be implemented by any
    IoD system while they focused on the concept of the layered networked control
    architecture. In this section, we present the architecture of the IoD ecosystem
    using a multi-layer system approach, where each layer identifies an actor in the
    system. The proposed architecture is also generic and instantiated on any specific
    IoD platform. The general architecture of the IoD is presented in Fig. 4. We decompose
    an abstract IoD system architecture into the following five major layers: • The
    Drone Layer: This layer refers to the flying aerial unmanned systems, which are
    equipped with: (i) sensors to collect data from the environment, and (ii) actuators/containers
    to carry the payload between different locations. The drone''s sensors depend
    on the type of data to collect. RGB camera sensors are used for collecting images
    and videos in applications such as inspection, surveillance, AI-based computer
    vision [36], photogrammetry, and aerial surveys. Multi-spectral cameras are used
    in agriculture use cases to improve the efficiency of large farming operations,
    including plant health assessment, disease detection, and plant counting. Thermal
    cameras are used in search and rescue operations and structural health monitoring.
    Weather sensors can be used to collect atmospheric data. In the IoD context, each
    drone must be identifiable, i.e., it has a unique ID. It is essential to track
    every drone in the ecosystem and send it to control commands through the network.
    Furthermore, a unique ID is crucial from a security perspective in case of crashes
    or any hazards caused by the drone''s operation. Drones must also be securely
    connected to the Internet to allow their secure tracking and monitoring in real
    time. • The Communication Layer: It refers to the communication protocols used
    to connect drones with the other actors and components of the system. Typical
    broadband communication systems are used, such as satellite communication, telecommunication
    networks (3G/4G/5G) [156], long-range WiFi [42], WiMAX [69], and IEEE 802.15.4
    [153]. In the case of mission-critical or military applications, the communication
    layer may use private and proprietary protocols to avoid possible threats, such
    as jamming and interference. The communication protocols must also be secure,
    in particular encryption, to avoid unauthorized access to the data. The communication
    layer must provide reliable and secure services to the drone layer considering
    the criticality of the drone''s operations. The required communication bandwidth
    depends on the application type. For high throughput applications, such as real-time
    drone video streaming and vision-based applications, the communication layer must
    provide high bandwidth channels to ensure streaming quality [154]. Bandwidth requirements
    are less stringent for IoT-like applications collecting low-rate data streams.
    • The Network Layer: A network of drones can be organized in different topologies
    and architectures depending on the application''s requirements. We can categorize
    the network layer into two main categories: (i) centralized architecture: a server
    or a ground station acts as a central node and coordinates the communication between
    the drones and users. This architecture is typically used in cloud-based UAV systems,
    where the cloud orchestrates and manages the UAV missions [156], and (ii) distributed
    architecture: there is no central entity that manages the communication between
    UAVs, but the communication is fully distributed and ad hoc. A UAV Swarm is a
    team of drones that communicate in an ad hoc manner to perform the desired mission
    [44]. In a typical scenario, one drone leader is chosen to coordinate the tasks
    of the drones without any intervention from external users, centralized ground
    stations, or servers. The distributed architecture is challenging because it requires
    the complete coordination of the drones in the swarm. However, this is hard to
    achieve because it involves broadcasting messages among the drones, resulting
    in flooding problems. Furthermore, the distributed architecture will require advanced
    ad hoc routing protocols, which is hard to accomplish due to the highly dynamic
    nature of drones'' motion in swarms. Security is a concern for centralized and
    distributed networking architectures because messages must travel via multiple
    hops. Routing protocols must embed security mechanisms to avoid any data compromise.
    • The Cloud Layer: The cloud layer is used for providing computation and storage
    services to drones and users. As UAVs are typically used to collect visual data,
    image frames are streamed to the cloud, which processes them using deep learning
    algorithms (i.e., convolutional neural networks) that are computation-intensive
    and storage-greedy and cannot be executed on typical drones. These algorithms
    might perform object detection and image segmentation and execute generative models,
    which are pretty demanding in terms of resources. The cloud also permanently stores
    the UAV flight mission data for possible scene reconstruction and analysis. The
    cloud can specify the business logic and constraints governed by the authority
    and applied by drone operators to coordinate drone missions, including flight
    schedules, mission planning, geofencing, and law enforcement. The cloud also regulates
    the traffic through the Unmanned Traffic Management (UTM) system, which manages
    drone operations and traffic among stakeholders (Client Layer). On the other hand,
    cloud storage and processing often represent a major concern regarding data privacy.
    Privacy-preserving approaches such as homomorphic encryption [12] were used with
    deep learning for aerial image processing to avoid disclosing private data on
    the cloud. Besides, the cloud should provide security features, including authentication,
    data integrity, confidentiality, and non-repudiation for all actors in the IoD
    ecosystem, including users, operators, and drones. • The Client Layer: This layer
    refers to the end-users who use and manage the system through the Internet. It
    relies on software Application Program Interfaces (APIs) using Web services to
    interact with the cloud. The users monitor the UAVs through dashboards and remotely
    send commands to control them. Users can also perform video surveillance as UAVs
    stream their collected video frames through the cloud. The client application
    may provide several services and business rules for drones'' missions (implemented
    in the cloud back-end), such as traffic management, geofencing, and path planning.
    There are different types of end-users (depending on the application and usage
    of IoD), which are referred to as stakeholders at the client layer. Let us consider
    a classic use case of a drone delivery mission, where a user requests a delivery
    mission of a package from a drone service provider. This scenario implies three
    types of users, including: – Operators: they represent drone service providers
    that operate drone missions, such as drone delivery missions, surveillance, and
    inspection. – Basic Users: these users interact with the cloud to request drone
    delivery services from the operators. – Authority: it represents the regulatory
    board that specifies the policies and by-laws of drone operations in the airspace.
    This may include civil aviation and defense authorities, as examples. The authority
    is responsible for validating the mission before the operator is allowed to execute
    the delivery mission. Other types of applications may imply other types of users.

    Fig. 4. Internet-of-Drones Architecture. 3.3. Communication paradigms in the Internet
    of drones There have been several research works dealing with communication paradigms
    for IoD. Nowadays, the use of UAVs is widespread in civil/military applications.
    The complexity of communication systems in IoD varies; it can be as simple as
    a single UAV communicating with a ground station to carry out the objectives for
    a mission [58], [79], [236], [284], and as complex as swarms of UAV systems cooperatively
    carrying out various aspects of joint missions [27], [146], [203], [211], [217],
    [302], [311], [331]. As UAVs are generally resource-constrained devices, they
    must consider various factors when addressing IoD communications, including energy
    efficiency, latency, and security. Here we present works addressing the IoD communication
    systems at two different levels: (i) Mobile Edge-Cloud Drone Communications and
    (ii) Decentralized Flying Ad-Hoc Networks. i) Mobile Edge-Cloud Drone Communications:
    Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) provides cloud computing capabilities and services
    at the edge of the network. A UAV flying within the radio range of the MEC device
    can communicate with the device and provide access to a user over the cloud. This
    concept is extended to the Internet of Drones, where multiple drones connect to
    MEC device(s), effectively creating a mobile ad-hoc network within the line of
    sight. The IoD ensures highly efficient network operation and service delivery
    quality and, as a result, improves the user experience. A cyber-physical system
    (CPS) based system was proposed by Narang et al. in [217]. The researchers presented
    the system architecture of the CPS-UAV integrated solution that is deployed as
    part of a large-scale disaster response system. The authors focus on network topology
    optimization and address communication issues within the mobile edge infrastructure
    and the multi-drone network. Authors in [203] presented a UAV-based Internet of
    Things platform used in the context of a crowd surveillance application. The proposed
    architecture of this system allows UAVs to capture real-time video and offload
    this video stream to a MEC device. Leveraging the underlying LTE/5G communication
    infrastructure, the video stream is transmitted to the cloud, where the image
    recognition system processes the data. The authors in this work demonstrate the
    working of the multiple-UAV cluster implementation. Wang et al., in their work
    in [311], demonstrated a bandwidth-efficient video analytics system using UAVs.
    The proposed system architecture minimizes the communication latency overhead
    by utilizing MEC. The MEC device captures the video stream from the drones in
    proximity, compressing the video data stream, and resulting in an optimized payload.
    The communication between the MEC device and the cloud utilizes an opportunistic
    approach to reduce latency and bandwidth usage. In [308], authors presented the
    Internet of Flying Things (IoFT) and discussed the opportunities and challenges
    for airborne MEC devices. A prototype for a Drone-as-a-Service (DaaS) is developed
    leveraging the fly-in and fly-out infrastructure for servers, where the flying
    UAV serves as an airborne mobile edge device. With this prototype implementation,
    it remains to be seen how the secure communication and load balancing between
    multiple MEC devices within the network would affect the system''s performance.
    The air-to-ground mobile edge network for UAVs is presented in [58]. Cheng et
    al., in this work, proposed the optimization of a multi-dimensional channel-based
    approach to drone management. The authors study the effects of the network''s
    topological changes on message transfer, scheduling, and device control. Tian
    et al. in [303] utilized a predictive authentication approach for IoD using a
    MEC device for secure communication. The drones use a lightweight online/offline
    signature to authenticate with the MEC device. The MEC manages and controls the
    authentication parameters within the MEC-drone network and serves as a secure
    communication device within the IoD. Furthermore, a predictive authentication
    approach was utilized to further reduce the cost of authentication within the
    UAV-MEC communication. ii) Decentralized Flying Ad-Hoc Networks: Another communication
    aspect in IoD communication is UAV-UAV communication. The communications between
    flying drones can essentially be mapped to a Flying Ad-hoc Network (FANET) [212].
    Similar to the vehicular network problem studied in the context of Vehicular Ad-hoc
    Networks (VANETs), drone-to-drone communications can be realized. Each device/node
    within a FANET can store the information or relay it to the next device in a multi-hop
    configuration. Furthermore, a drone can also work as a data mule to carry the
    information to another part of the network or even to a different network. Using
    the Delay Tolerant Network (DTN), this information can be relayed to other devices
    such as drones, MEC, or even a GCS. Due to the delay-tolerant capability, missions
    can be completed opportunistically in different time frames. Flying ad-hoc network
    architecture is presented in [34]. Bekmezci et al. presented the potential advantages
    and disadvantages of ad-hoc communication between flying drones by classifying
    them into UAV-UAV, ground-UAV, and satellite-UAV communication challenges. They
    developed a protocol based on the work presented in [35]. This communication protocol
    focused on reducing the communication overhead by periodically broadcasting the
    link state updates. Similar to Bekmezci et al.''s approach to utilizing MANET
    protocols for IoD communications, many recent works have addressed IoD communication
    issues, taking the lead from works in the context of MANETs and VANETs. Due to
    high mobility within FANETs, the network topology frequently changes, necessitating
    periodic route discovery. A route-switching algorithm was presented in Yanmaz
    et al. [216]. This algorithm tracks all possible routes from a source to all destinations
    within a FANET, similar to the AODV routing protocol [214] for MANETs. Furthermore,
    due to high mobility and ever-changing network topology and avoiding the risk
    of broken routes, the proposed protocol switches to risk-free routes, when possible,
    to avoid route failure. This mechanism is based on the earlier TSODR routing protocol
    [89] for MANETs. The Zone Routing Protocol (ZRP) [301] addresses FANET communications.
    A crowd of drones serving as relay nodes within the network is considered a zone.
    The communication within the zone is proactive, whereas a reactive protocol is
    used for inter-zone communication. In [174], researchers presented the GPMOR protocol,
    which predicts the movement of UAVs utilizing a Gaussian-Markov mobility model.
    This protocol considers the position of a UAV to determine the next hop in FANETs.
    It also addressed the communication delay due to network congestion by reducing
    the communication overhead. This protocol is also based on an earlier MANET protocol;
    namely, TORA [233]. The publisher-subscriber model for routing was used for MANET
    routing in [301]. Authors in [146] develop a communication protocol for FANETs
    using a data-centric approach based on this model. A UAV carries data and transports
    it to a destination utilizing the load-carry-deliver approach popular in DTN networks.
    Performance evaluation results from this protocol showed increased throughput;
    however, increasing the coverage area yields negative results in terms of overall
    performance. In [211], authors couple intrinsic properties of DTN routing with
    FANETs outlining the load-carry-deliver routing mechanism. Another work [27] similarly
    takes benefit of DTN routing protocols for MEC-UAV communication. 3.4. Cloud integration
    and computation offloading In this section, we describe recent advances in cloud-based
    IoD systems with a focus on offloading computation from drones to the edge of
    the cloud [190]. UAVs have been used as aerial Base Stations (BSs). Compared to
    ground base stations, the aerial base stations provide better maneuverability,
    can be deployed on-demand, and can relocate to positions suitable to different
    environments. Drones generally have limited onboard resources for processing information,
    and limited storage [47]. Off-the-shelf UAV devices are usually resource-constrained
    regarding three aspects, i.e., size, weight, and power [154]. These UAVs are typically
    battery-powered and can carry a limited payload. A small UAV is usually limited
    in terms of battery capacity available onboard and a maximum flight time of around
    25-50 minutes [274]. Applications or platforms requiring heavy computation may
    further drain the already limited power [154]. An IoD system may offload some
    energy-taxing computation-intensive tasks to a resource-rich drone or even to
    a Mobile Edge device within the cloud. In the context of IoD, several criteria
    can define offloading computation to the cloud ranging from fast processing of
    large information on-the-go to storage of information for a long period [47].
    Here, we describe recent works focusing on (i) latency issues, (ii) energy and
    load balancing, (iii) data management and storage, and (iv) safety, security,
    and privacy. Table 3 presents a summary of works describing task offloading in
    IoD. Here, we briefly describe the related works: Table 3. Research works in Computational

    UAV-Cloud Yes No Yes No Real-time object tracking using a cloud-based IoD Wu et
    al. [322] proposed a three-layer architecture to address the efficient task offloading
    between a UAV and MEC. They presented two algorithms: i) UAV position optimization,
    and ii) a task prediction algorithm. The proposed algorithms consider energy efficiency
    in task offloading for the UAV-MEC network considering various parameters, including
    UAV hovering parameters and accurate payload size for offloading tasks. Simulations
    validate the proposed algorithms, and the results show that the proposed algorithms
    reduce energy consumption. The authors also proposed using better optimization
    techniques to further improve the task placement on UAV-MEC systems. Wang et al.
    [314] proposed an agent-based task offloading for a UAV-aided mobile edge cloud
    system. The proposed system architecture considers latency and energy aspects
    of scheduling tasks to be offloaded to a mobile edge or cloud. The agent is designed
    to select an offloading strategy based on various parameters, including payload
    size, available resources on user devices, UAV''s available resources, and the
    MEC. An extensive simulation study is carried out to assess the impact of the
    task delay and energy consumption for offloading. The results show that an efficient
    task placement strategy is essential to improve the performance of task offloading
    to the cloud compared to scenarios with the absence of the agent. Sedjelmaci et
    al. [265] presented an efficient cyber defense framework for UAV-edge computing
    networks. The authors addressed the security vulnerabilities on task offloading
    to a MEC, including a Denial-of-Service attack to put the UAV and the MEC out
    of service. They presented a Stackelberg game-based security framework where they
    model (i) the attack behavior of latency to offload tasks and (ii) the energy
    consumption in the UAV. A MEC-based agent detects and predicts malicious behaviors
    based on various parameters. The framework is validated using simulation studies,
    and the results show that as the number of attackers increases, the prediction
    rate for malicious nodes also increases. However, a large portion of energy consumption
    is attributed to detecting and preventing malicious behaviors. Mukherjee et al.
    [213] proposed an intra-UAV swarm processing offloading scheme to address latency
    in processing-intensive tasks. They proposed a weighted-offloading technique that
    uses a Nash bargaining game between the probabilities of nodes processing the
    data or offloading to nodes by a queuing theory-based analysis of the network
    traffic in the UAV swarm. This work builds various datasets based on real-life
    hardware metrics calculated from a swarm of four UAVs in the context of rural
    farming. The authors extended this work by further carrying out an extensive simulation
    study with a large number of UAVs following various network topologies. The results
    show that the proposed scheme is highly scalable and performs faster than the
    star network topology. Koubaa et al. [156] presented a service-oriented cloud-based
    drone management system. The Dronemap project discussed in this work addresses
    the control, monitoring, and communication of drones over the Internet. Dronemap
    utilizes the ROSLink protocol [152] for seamless inter-drone communication over
    the Internet. The system incorporates the cloud offloading mechanism in Dronemap
    to offload heavy computations [154] from the drone to the cloud. This is materialized
    by the use of Web services (SOAP and REST), where the user can schedule drone
    missions to accomplish the task at hand. In this work, the authors demonstrated
    a proof-of-concept implementation of the system in various scenarios showing that
    it is scalable and can be seamlessly deployed anywhere. In another work by the
    same authors [155], DroneTrack is presented. This system develops real-time Internet-enabled
    object tracking using a UAV. The DroneTrack leverages the Dronemap planner [156],
    which is a cloud-based system that can be deployed to control and manage UAVs
    over the Internet. The authors conducted an experimental study with three scenarios.
    The experimental study demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed system.
    4. Cyber and physical attacks In this section, we present the security requirements
    of the IoD. Then, we provide a novel classification of assets in IoD systems.
    This classification is later used to propose a taxonomy for attacks and countermeasures.
    The proposed classification adopts the risk assessment approach, which organizations
    have widely adopted to identify all possible risks to assets, evaluate them, determine
    their impact, and make decisions on them to prioritize the implementation of security
    countermeasures. Specifically, we apply this approach by identifying the IoD''s
    possible components (or assets), i.e., where exactly the different attacks could
    compromise the IoD. This will also help us know which vulnerability is exploited,
    the magnitude of the risk, its impact, and later identify its corresponding countermeasures.
    Additionally, it will guide the academia and industry community to prioritize
    research efforts and focus more on attacks with high risks. 4.1. Security requirements
    An IoD is a cyber-physical system that needs to ensure security regarding information
    and control. In our context, security could be defined as the ability of the IoD
    to correctly perform the intended operations without unauthorized access, alteration,
    disclosure of information, or loss of assets. It is required that IoD meets different
    security requirements, including authentication, confidentiality, availability,
    non-repudiation, integrity, and privacy. • Authentication: It ensures that only
    authorized users (e.g., operators and end-users) and authorized devices (i.e.,
    drone and GCS) are granted access to IoD resources. If authentication is not ensured,
    a malicious entity can impersonate a drone, get confidential information, and
    inject malicious commands and data. • Confidentiality: It ensures that information
    is not disclosed to unauthorized users. In IoD, we can find different types of
    information: (i) data and commands that are exchanged among the different components
    of IoD, (ii) data that are captured by the drones (e.g., sensed values, captured
    images), (iii) data that are transferred over the network, and (iv) data that
    are exchanged among the subsets of the components such as system states that are
    sent on the communication channels among the sensors, controllers, actuators,
    and the transmission system. • Availability: It ensures that all components of
    the IoD should perform the required operations correctly (i.e., monitoring, computation,
    control, actuation, transmission, and storage) and should be available when it
    is requested. • Integrity: We consider two integrity properties: data integrity
    and system integrity. Data integrity ensures that no malicious or accidental modification
    or deletion of data, such as telemetry data and commands, is performed. Failure
    to satisfy data integrity could also lead to the compromise of availability, e.g.,
    a flight control system that receives wrong GPS information, which negatively
    affects the mission planning of the drone. On the other hand, system integrity
    ensures that the deployed software and firmware are trusted and free from malicious
    codes. • Non-repudiation: This requirement pertains to legal issues. As drones
    are involved in different types of applications, tracking user activities is necessary
    to determine liability in case of an accident or an incident caused by drones.
    In the case of communication, non-repudiation ensures the prevention of a sender
    from denying the generation of messages or a drone from denying sending images
    or messages. Also, piloting drones carelessly can result in physical damage and
    loss. Non-repudiation aims to ensure that the drone and the drone operators cannot
    deny their activities. • Privacy: The drone mission can reveal user-specific information,
    such as visited locations and captured data. Therefore, drone missions must be
    protected against traffic analysis or data capturing to preserve user data privacy.
    Moreover, if drone-collected data is processed and outsourced (such as in a cloud
    system), adequate cryptographic techniques (such as homomorphic encryption) need
    to be set up to preserve user privacy [173]. The compromise of any security requirement
    could consequently compromise the safety requirement. By safety, we mean that
    drones can fly without causing human and physical damage. Integrating IoD with
    civil airspace makes it essential to ensure that drones can safely operate within
    the commonly shared aviation system and environment. A drone must avoid colliding
    with other drones, properties, and people. 4.2. Two-level asset-based classification
    An asset is a concept primarily used in risk assessment methodology, which refers
    to any tangible or intangible objects that have value to the organization. Asset
    identification represents the first step in risk assessment. It helps identify
    the threats that could harm the assets and consequently identifies the countermeasures
    that can be put in place to mitigate these threats. In the IoD context, an asset
    means any element of the IoD required to operate the IoD and its applications
    (Fig. 5). Therefore, it needs to be protected against cyber and physical threats.
    For better protection of the IoD, we adopt a fine-grained asset identification
    approach, which allows broader identification of possible threats, and hence better
    security can be achieved. To this end, we propose a two-level asset-based classification.
    In the first level, we find coarse-grained assets, which refer to the tangible
    elements of the IoD and the wireless communication media that interconnect these
    elements. In the second level, some coarse-grained assets can be divided into
    multiple fine-grained assets. Download : Download high-res image (237KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 5. IoD assets. More precisely, in the IoD context,
    we propose the two-level asset-based classification, which considers the following
    coarse-grained and fine-grained assets, as shown in Table 4. • Drone: It consists
    of the following fine-grained assets: – Flight control system: It is the CPU that
    allows the pilot to fly the drone using steering commands and signals provided
    by the embedded sensors. It also provides the actuators'' updated information
    to adjust their speed and trajectory. – Transmission system: It represents the
    communication interface that allows the drone to communicate with the ground control
    system and other drones. – Sensors: The drone includes different sensors to sense
    its physical environment, like an accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetic orientation
    sensor, barometer, and camera. The data from sensors are used to compute the driving
    force of the motor, the movement direction, and the altitude for the drone to
    fly. – GPS receiver: It is a device that calculates the drone''s geographical
    position based on signals received from satellites'' navigation systems. – actuator:
    It is a device that helps the drone to make the right movement decision. This
    is done by converting energy into mechanical actions. The drone''s motor is one
    of the best examples of an electromechanical actuator. – software: It is the component
    that connects the user to the drone''s hardware. The generic software architecture
    of a drone consists of (a) system software, which includes firmware, device driver,
    and operating system, and (b) application software that runs different functions
    such as: taking pictures, vision processing, video streaming, navigation, and
    mission execution. • Ground control station: It is a land-based control station
    that consists of the following fine-grained assets: – Ground control system: It
    is a software system that allows human operators to remotely control the drone
    during its operations. – Transmission system: It is used to exchange data and
    commands between the drone and the ground control system. – Mission planning system:
    It provides the flying trajectory for a single or group of drones to perform their
    missions. • Cloud: It is used to store, process, and analyze data collected by
    the drones and comprises the following fine-grained assets: – Stored data: It
    represents data obtained during drones'' missions. – Data processing model: It
    is used to analyze the stored data to get insights from the drones'' missions.
    • Wireless communication medium: It is used by communicating entities to transmit
    messages in the form of electromagnetic signals. Two types of messages are transmitted:
    – Information transmitted from drones to the ground control station or exchanged
    among the drones. – Commands that are transmitted from the human operator to the
    drones. • People: We identify two types of people: – Operators: They perform activities
    related to the drone''s mission, like piloting the drone through some commands.
    – Pre-operators: They represent people who contribute to developing the required
    software to operate the IoD. • Payload: It represents the object that is carried
    by the drone. Table 4. Two-level asset categorization. Coarse-grained asset Level-1

    HM  Payload PHO Payload PHO The coarse-grained and fine-grained assets can also
    be classified according to Level-1 type and Level-2 type, respectively, as presented
    in Table 4. More specifically, the coarse-grained assets can be classified with
    respect to Level-1 type as follows: • Physical systems (PHS): They represent all
    tangible elements with computation and communication capabilities, such as drones,
    ground control stations, and cloud systems. • Physical objects (PHO): They represent
    all elements that have neither computation nor communication capabilities, such
    as carried payload. • Wireless communication channels (WCM): They represent the
    different Wireless communication technologies, such as Wi-Fi, and 4G, which are
    used to exchange information among the physical systems of the IoD. • Human (HM):
    They represent all persons who have a role in developing, implementing, deploying,
    and operating the IoD. In addition, the fine-grained assets can be classified
    with respect to Level-2 type as follows: • Cyber fine-grained assets (CY) : They
    refer to the fine-grained assets that belong to the cyber world, such as transmitted
    and stored data and all the components that perform either computation, control,
    or communication operations. • Cyber-physical fine-grained assets (CP) : They
    refer to the fine-grained assets that connect the cyber world with the physical
    world, such as sensors and actuators. In our classification, as People and Payload
    cannot be divided into smaller entities, we consider them as both coarse-grained
    and fine-grained assets. Thus, Level-1 and Level-2 of the different types of People
    are Human. Similarly, Level-1 and Level-2 of Payload is Physical object. 4.3.
    Classification of attacks In the literature, the attacks against IoD are classified
    according to different criteria. Kim et al. [143] identified three types of attacks:
    hardware attacks against the UAV autopilot components, wireless attacks performed
    through a wireless communication medium, and sensor attacks spoofing that injects
    false data through the sensors of UAV. In [220], the attacks are classified with
    respect to the target layer, i.e., physical, data link, network, transport, perception,
    and application layers. In [156], the target layer criterion is also used to classify
    the attacks. Specifically, the attacks can be launched against three layers, i.e.,
    the proxy layer, the cloud layer, and the drone layer. In [325], the threats are
    classified as threats that target drones and threats that use drones. On the other
    hand, many works [62], [193], [326] categorized the IoD attacks based on the compromised
    security properties such as attacks on confidentiality, integrity, availability,
    privacy, trust, and other properties. However, an attacker could compromise more
    than one security property. Differently from the attack classifications mentioned
    above, we use the two-level asset-based classification, which is proposed in Section
    4.2 to introduce a novel classification of attacks in IoD. This classification
    considers the Targeted Coarse-grained Asset, and the Targeted Fine-grained Asset
    in addition to other criteria. More precisely, we classify the attacks with respect
    to different criteria, as presented in Fig. 6. The main classification criterion
    is Nature of Attack, and accordingly, two classes are identified. The first class
    covers the cyber attacks, which are presented in Section 4.4. The second class
    covers the physical attacks, which are presented in Section 4.5. The other classification
    criteria, i.e., Target, Compromised Security Requirements, and Impact, of cyber
    and physical attacks, are presented in Table 5 and Table 6 respectively. In more
    detail, the attacks are classified according to the following criteria: • Nature
    of attack: The attack can be classified as cyber or physical. – Cyberattack occurs
    when there is cyber manipulation of the system without physical access. – By physical
    attack, we mean that an adversary gains physical access to an asset to damage
    it. • Target: It specifies the asset that is targeted by the attacks. We identify
    two types of targets: – Targeted coarse-grained asset: It indicates the coarse-grained
    asset that is targeted by the attack. – Targeted fine-grained asset: It indicates
    the fine-grained asset targeted by the attack. • Compromised security requirements:
    It specifies which attack compromises security requirements. The attack can take
    two types of behavior: passive and active. Passive attacks mainly compromise the
    confidentiality requirements, whereas active attacks compromise the rest of the
    security requirements. • Impact: The attacks can inflict different types of negative
    impacts and undesirable consequences, and one impact can lead to another one.
    To this end, we introduce a novel concept, named Chain of impact, which connects
    four types of impacts: direct impact, mission impact, drone impact, and environmental
    impact, as shown in Fig. 7. – Direct impact: It compromises the following impacts
    that can lead to a situation where the IoD fails to accomplish its mission: *
    Data compromise: It includes data disclosure, data loss, and data manipulation.
    * Disruption of cyber and cyber-physical operations: The execution of some operations
    in IoD, such as computation, communication, control, sensing, and actuation, could
    be disrupted through false data or vulnerable functions. This could result in
    mission failure due to compromised trajectory, hijacking of drones, drone crashing,
    and drone collision. * Loss of communication and GPS signals: The mission of the
    IoD could be disturbed due to the absence of communication or the GPS signals.
    – Mission impact: It represents the negative effects of the attack on the mission
    of the IoD. It is characterized by the disruption of cyber and cyber-physical
    operations of IoD, such as computation, communication, control, and sensing, which
    could lead to drone hijacking. Some false information (flight commands and GPS
    signals) could also result in drone hijacking. Once the drone is hijacked, it
    could be later captured by the adversary or damaged due to a crash or collision
    with other objects. The mission could fail due to compromised trajectory, hijacking
    of drones, drone crashing, and drone collision. – Drone impact: It represents
    the attack''s negative effect on the drone''s physical availability. The drone
    could be lost when captured by an adversary or damaged when it crashes or collides
    with other drones or objects. – Environmental impact: It represents the harmful
    effects of compromised IoD on the environment. It occurs when one or more processes
    and physical assets are compromised, which can damage the environment. It includes
    human loss and physical damage to properties when drones collide with stationary
    and moving objects. Download : Download high-res image (154KB) Download : Download

    as shown in Fig. 7. The figure depicts a Finite State Machine (FSM), where the
    states represent the different impacts, and each arrowed line represents transitions

    impact can be expressed, as shown in Table 5 and Table 6, as regular expressions
    over an alphabet We use two basic operations in regular expressions to express
    the chain of impact: (1) choice among alternatives, which is indicated by the
    character “|”, and (2) concatenation, which is indicated by juxtaposition (without
    character). Download : Download high-res image (152KB) Download : Download full-size

    DT PL 4.4. Cyber attacks 4.4.1. Attacks targeting drones • Attacks targeting flight
    control system – Manipulation of captured footage: This attack targets low-altitude
    UAVs, which rely on the video captured by their cameras for navigation and collision
    avoidance. An attacker with a high level of knowledge of the flight control system
    can replace the genuine footage with a fabricated one. – Manipulation of flight
    controller: If the attacker can manipulate the parameters of the flight controller
    by injecting false information or through malicious software, it is possible to
    disrupt the drone''s operations. • Attacks targeting transmission system – Flooding
    attack: In this attack, the intruder floods the drone with random commands, which
    prevents its transmission system from processing legitimate commands. This denial
    of service attack might discharge the drone''s battery. Moreover, the attacker
    can prevent communication and consume the bandwidth by continuously sending random
    commands or control signals [188]. • Attacks targeting sensors – False sensor
    data injection: By injecting false sensor data, an attacker can disrupt the operation
    of the drone [3]. Examples of sensors that can be manipulated are infrared, radar,
    and electro-optical sensors. This attack targets the drone sensors asset and needs
    a high knowledge of the drone parameters to succeed. • Attacks targeting GPS receiver:
    As GPS signals are unencrypted and unauthenticated, they could be targeted by
    GPS spoofing and GPS jamming attacks. – GPS spoofing: An attacker could send fake
    GPS signals to make the GPS receiver compute the wrong geographic coordinates.
    In this way, the attacker could hijack the drone and take control of its flight
    trajectory. – GPS jamming: It is possible to jam the GPS signals and prevent them
    from reaching the drone, which leads to the drone crashing. 4.4.2. Attacks targeting
    ground control station - Manipulation of flight control commands: If the attacker
    can access the ground control system, it is possible to send malicious flight
    control commands to the drone, which could disturb its mission and could lead
    to a drone crash. - Compromising the mission planning system: The role of the
    mission planning system is to assign and schedule flight missions of the drone
    or a fleet of drones. If the logic of the mission planning system is compromised
    through malware, the mission of the UAV system will fail. 4.4.3. Attacks targeting
    wireless medium - Unauthorized disclosure of communication: As drones communicate
    through the wireless medium, interception of the exchanged message is an easy
    task, especially for attackers equipped with adequate materials. These intercepted
    messages, i.e., telemetry feeds and GCS commands, can be analyzed; hence, critical
    and confidential data might be revealed. An eavesdropping attack is difficult
    to detect as the attacker does not alter the exchanged message. However, deploying
    a strong encryption mechanism can mitigate this kind of passive attack. - Signal
    spoofing: As signals are unencrypted and unauthenticated, the transmission systems
    cannot confirm their authenticity, and hence spoofed signals from the drones to
    GCS or vice versa could negatively disrupt the drone operations. - Signal jamming:
    Signals are easily jammed, and the attacker interferes with communication between
    drones or between a drone and the ground control station, which could disable
    the communication and therefore put the system out of service. It could also disrupt
    drone operations as important command messages could not reach the drone, leading
    to crashes or collisions. 4.4.4. Attacks targeting people Social engineering attacks
    such as phishing and spear phishing aim to lure drone operators into clicking
    on malicious links and downloading malicious attachments, compromising their devices.
    A Watering hole attack is also a social engineering technique where the attacker
    infects existing websites that users visit. This way, the users could download
    malware or be redirected to other websites to access the operator''s device or
    network. 4.4.5. Attacks targeting the cloud For IoD, the cloud system comprises
    two components: (1) a database of information sent by the drones and (2) the processing
    model to analyze the drones'' data. The database could be compromised in the cloud
    due to many attacks [282]. Also, adversarial learning could target the processing
    model by injecting specific malicious input to mislead the model into making wrong
    decisions. 4.4.6. Attacks targeting many assets - Identity spoofing: an attacker
    can spoof the identity of a legitimate user to get access to the IoD system. Moreover,
    an attacker can deploy a malicious drone with a spoofed identity to interact with
    other drones or the GCS. The lack of an efficient authentication mechanism allows
    an attacker to claim a legitimate identity and therefore access drones'' carried
    data or request malicious action. - Man-in-the-Middle attack: In this attack,
    a malicious deployed drone (or malicious GCS) tricks the communicating parties
    by making all exchanged messages pass through it. In this attack, which is generally
    launched between a drone and the GCS, the malicious entity first intercepts the
    message sent by the GCS (respectively sent by the drone) and then sends a modified
    version to the drone (respectively sent by the GCS). The communicating parties
    believe that they communicate directly with each other; however, the reality is
    that each one is communicating with a malicious entity. MIM can have several impacts
    ranging from eavesdropping the communication to taking control of the drone. -
    Malicious Software: Malware such as Trojans, backdoors, and keyloggers can target
    the different assets of IoD systems, such as drones and GCSs, and result in disastrous
    impacts. There is an already available malware that targets the IoD, known as
    Maldrone [21]. Maldrone first opens a backdoored connection with its botmaster,
    thus enabling the reception of commands and taking control of the drone. The developer
    could initially implement the malicious software into the drone or access the
    drone through a malicious update of the firmware, operating system, and other
    installed applications. The drone vendors releasing software updates could be
    infected by attackers so that the drone software is also infected. - Denial of
    service attack: It aims to disturb the drone or network operation or to exhaust
    drones'' resources through the following: – Jamming attack: the attacker interferes
    with communication between drones or between a drone and the ground control station.
    A jamming attack stops the drone and ground controller communication, putting
    the system out of service. – Denial of Service (DoS): Drones are characterized
    by limited resources. An attacker can exploit this characteristic to launch a
    DoS attack through excessive utilization of resources. DoS attacks can also be
    achieved by sending successive unnecessary requests to the drone, making it unable
    to respond to legitimate user requests. – Commands flooding: In this kind of DoS
    attack, the intruder floods the victim drone with random commands, consuming the
    victim''s computation power and possibly discharging its battery. Moreover, the
    attacker can prevent communication and consume the bandwidth by continuously sending
    random commands or control signals [188]. 4.5. Physical attacks Besides the cyber
    attacks investigated above, IoD is also vulnerable to many physical attacks/threats.
    These types of attacks target the hardware components. For example, an attacker
    gains physical access to the IoD environment to destroy IoD devices and obtain
    sensitive information, leading to IoD devices malfunctioning or preventing the
    accomplishment of their missions. Their presence poses an additional risk that
    should be considered. This section presents possible physical attacks targeting
    the IoD environment''s physical assets (IoD devices). • Weather condition threats:
    Drones are vulnerable to bad weather conditions since they may lead to deviations
    in their trajectories. Strong winds put the drone out of balance, and rain can
    damage the circuits. Harsh weather conditions, such as icing, freezing rain, thunderstorms,
    and clouds, can impact the drone''s stability, operation, and travel distance,
    and eventually cause accidents due to its lightweight design and battery dependence.
    Furthermore, weather conditions, turbulence, and ice storms can significantly
    affect cyber performance, resulting in GPS failure or a lost link state. • Civic
    challenges: Dynamic obstacles or the presence of civic constituents pose a challenge
    to UAVs and may ultimately cause damage to the drone if they are hit. Civic components
    such as trees, buildings, street lights, electric cables, and poles are essential
    examples of such challenges as they may interfere with the drone path. • Battery
    depletion: In the IoD environment, resources are limited; thus, an attacker can
    exploit excessive resource utilization. To do so, the attacker enables excessive
    services, which increase the resource depletion rate (battery) and thereby reduce
    the performance of the IoD in the target missions. This could lead to mission
    failure, drone crashes, and damage to its components. • Node tampering: The attacker
    physically accesses the drone and tampers with its data and its software to get
    full control over the IoD environment and get sensitive and confidential information.
    • Physical capture attack: Drones are not physically protected in the IoD environment.
    Therefore, drones are prone to physical capture attacks. An attacker having physical
    access to the drone can damage the drone''s components, hence affecting the drone''s
    operation. Another scenario is that the attacker can use the extracted data stored
    in the captured drones to disrupt communication between other nodes in the IoD
    environment. In this case, the drone will send false alerts to interrupt the correct
    functioning of the IoD. In such situations, an attacker may capture the IoD devices
    and switch off the services assigned to the entire IoD or alter the configuration
    settings, resulting in multiple mission failures and collisions. • Malicious node
    injection: The attacker physically adds a fake node between legitimate nodes in
    the IoD network. Hence, the attacker grants access to sensitive information and
    controls data exchanged between IoD nodes. • Physical damage: The attacker physically
    damages IoD components, thereby causing the unavailability of services. • Malicious
    code injection: This attack focuses on physically introducing a malicious code
    into the IoD nodes, allowing the attacker to gain access to the IoD environment.
    • Malicious code modification: With malicious code modification, the attacker
    can gain unauthorized access to the IoD network. The difference between this attack
    and the malicious code injection attack is that the attacker does not inject new
    malicious codes into the physical component; instead, it modifies the current
    algorithms. The adversary exploits this attack to access the drone''s control
    unit to alter its configuration, thereby interrupting its correct functioning.
    This attack can be cascaded to a UAV swarm. • Theft and vandalism: As the drones
    fly within a visual distance, it makes them a prime target for theft and vandalism,
    which can be achieved using different methods ranging from an anti-drone rifle,
    and hostile drones, to a simple dart gun. The attacker uses these tools to destroy
    the drone and perform illegal activities such as stealing the package/cargo handled
    by the drone. • Interceptor drone: Another approach to disable and crash drones
    is adopting another drone (“Interceptor Drone”) equipped with interception tools.
    The interceptor drone attaches a net gun to it to stop the propellers from turning
    and causing the drone to crash, thereby causing harm to people and destroying
    facilities and the drone itself. Other drones are equipped with laser guns that
    emit a high-energy laser beam that causes a drone to burn in the air, fall to
    the ground, and possibly cause harm to third parties. • Physical social engineering:
    The drone and the ground station are vulnerable to malicious hardware attacks.
    Whenever the attacker is granted access to the UAV flight control system and ground
    control unit, he can install additional components that give him control over
    the IoD and get sensitive data. Such an attack is conducted during the maintenance
    of the drone. On the other hand, hardware trojans, like backdoors, are inserted
    in the UAV''s computation chips to compromise security mechanisms and lead to
    catastrophic consequences. 4.6. Risk assessment Table 8 and Table 9 present the
    risk assessment of the different cyber and physical attacks respectively, which
    can target the IoD. The risk [248] is expressed as a function of the likelihood
    of the attack and the corresponding impact. To estimate the likelihood of the
    attack, we need to determine the extent to which the threat agent can exploit
    the vulnerability successfully. We assign two values to likelihood: • High: The
    threat actor requires minor or no knowledge about the target system, limited expertise,
    and limited resources to exploit the vulnerability. • Low: The threat actor requires
    detailed knowledge about the target system, a high level of expertise, and significant
    resources to exploit the vulnerability. We assign the following values to impact:
    • Low: In case of direct and mission impact. • Moderate: In case of drone impact.
    • High: In case of environmental impact. Based on the likelihood and impact values,
    we assign fives values to the risk, i.e., insignificant, low, medium, high, and
    extreme, as shown in Table 7. Table 7. Risk matrix. Likelihood/Impact Low Moderate
    High Low Insignificant Low Medium High Medium High Extreme In Table 8, we can
    notice that the risks, which are related to Flooding attacks, GPS spoofing, and
    GPS jamming, are extreme, as it is easy for the adversaries to access and compromise
    their corresponding assets, i.e., Transmission system and GPS receiver, and these
    attacks can damage the environment. This indicates that the above-mentioned attacks
    require greater attention and stronger countermeasures than other attacks. We
    can also notice that the risk related to a False data injection attack is insignificant
    since access to the cloud database is difficult and requires expertise and effort.
    Only stored data are compromised if the attack occurs, and the impact does not
    move to the drone or the environment. The rest of the risks are either low or
    medium. Table 8. Risk assessment of cyber attacks. Coarse-grained asset Fine-grained

    Identity spoofing Low High Medium  Drone, GCS, People Flight control system, Software,
    Ground control system, Pre-operator Malicious software Low Moderate Low In Table
    9, weather conditions threats, and civic challenges are considered extreme risks.
    For instance, weather condition threats can easily affect the flying trajectory
    of the drone, damage its circuit, and damage the environment. Civic challenges
    can also cause damage to the drone and the environment. The risk related to interceptor
    drones and payload theft is high, especially when the drone flies within the visual
    distance of the adversary or the range of interception tools. The likelihood of
    these attacks is low because they require knowledge, expertise, and resources
    that are only within reach of the experts. As for drone security, physical access
    to the drone and tampering with its data and software is difficult and requires
    knowledge and expertise; thus, the likelihood of the attack is low. In case of
    a successful physical access attack, the impact can be either direct or mission,
    and therefore the risk is assigned an insignificant value. The risk could increase
    if another attack is launched to exploit the compromised data and software. As
    the ground control station is a secure facility, the likelihood of launching successful
    attacks is low. The risk is insignificant in the case of malicious node injection,
    malicious code modification, and physical and social engineering. In case of node
    tampering and physical capture, the mission of drones, which are associated with
    the ground control station, is affected, and hence the risk increases to low.

    countermeasures In this section, we discuss the security features provided by
    the drone operating system. We also present the cyber and physical countermeasures
    proposed in the literature for IoD and propose a taxonomy that classifies them.
    5.1. Taxonomy of countermeasures We classify the countermeasures, as shown in
    Fig. 8, as follows: • Drone operating system security countermeasures: They represent
    countermeasures that provide security to the drone operating system and test its
    security properties. The description of these countermeasures is presented in
    Section 5.2. • Technical countermeasures: A countermeasure is considered technical
    if it involves technologies such as cryptographic tools and IDSs. Technical countermeasures
    can be classified as: cyber and physical countermeasures. – Cyber countermeasures:
    We categorize them as: pre-incident and post-incident. * Pre-incident countermeasures:
    They represent the countermeasures implemented and deployed before the occurrence
    of security incidents and can be classified as: preventive and detective. · Preventive:
    They correspond to the actions required to prevent the attack from occurring.
    We can find three types of countermeasures: 1. Cryptography and key management:
    These countermeasures are described in Section 5.3.1, and summarized in Table

    system security The drone operating system represents an interface between the
    drone hardware and the application software/user. The operating system manages
    the drone hardware and other external devices, e.g., it controls the flight controller
    and takes input from the other instruments. It also embodies instructions for
    executing the application software. Unmanned aerial systems (UASs) require secure,
    reliable, and compact software platforms. A real-time operating system (RTOS)
    is specially developed for resource-constrained and security-sensitive environments
    [181]. RTOS is used in systems requiring a response within very specific time
    limits. The system''s reliability depends not only on the correctness of results
    but also on how fast the response is provided by the system [337]. Rani et al.
    [243] implemented and tested a hacking procedure on a commercial UAV known as
    Parrot AR.Drone by performing a cyber attack to take complete control over the
    UAV and expose the security vulnerabilities in commercial UAVs. The communication
    system''s weaknesses were exploited to access the device, where the Robot Operating
    System (ROS) tools were used to control it by altering the flight path. It was
    demonstrated that a hacker could cause irrecoverable damage to the UAV and take
    over the UAV by compromising the communication links between the UAV and the operator.
    The hacker joystick was used in the experiments to control the Parrot AR.Drone,
    and various new commands were executed when the user was disconnected from the
    system. The authors also concluded that no system is completely secure because
    of the inherent shortcomings in the operating system that can lead to potential
    vulnerabilities. Pike et al. [238] focused on software integrity attacks related
    to modifying the control flow of a program. Code injection and return-to-libc
    attacks are examples of conventional methods for launching attacks against software
    integrity. Attacks related to control flow are pretty common, and various protection
    methods have been introduced to tackle such attacks, for example, canaries [93]
    and address-space layout randomization [271]. However, researchers have developed
    various ways to bypass these protections using methods such as return-oriented
    programming. Another technique, known as control-flow integrity (CFI) [2], is
    considered hard to exploit. It uses run-time checks to ensure that a program follows
    its static control-flow graph. The research community has recommended this technique
    as a potential candidate for protecting program integrity. Hence, the authors
    in [238] proposed a CFI-aware real-time operating system, called TrackOS, to provide
    CFI protections for critical embedded software in real-time embedded systems.
    In TrackOS, there is built-in support to perform CFI checks over various tasks,
    and these tasks do not need any specific run-time modifications or instrumentation
    to be examined. TrackOS overcame the delay and jitter issues associated with CFI
    program instrumentation. Instead of instrumenting a program, a separate monitor
    task performs the CFI checks on various untrusted tasks. The monitor task is a
    privileged task scheduled by the TrackOS, and it has access to the memory of other
    tasks. Dey et al. [74] studied security vulnerabilities related to Parrot Bebop
    2 and DJI Phantom 4 Pro drones that use BusyBox, which is a Unix-based operating
    system. They also presented some defense mechanisms against the identified security
    vulnerabilities. They concluded that the Phantom 4 Pro is a highly secure and
    robust commercially available drone; however, it still requires further improvements
    and extensive security analysis. On the contrary, Parrot Bebop 2 drone lacked
    security measures; hence it is unsafe for personal or commercial usage. Lee et
    al. [166] proposed a security framework that operates in ROS for a UAS and explained
    the vulnerabilities. The framework focuses on security issues related to flight
    missions and the overhead caused by using additional security elements. The performance
    of the proposed framework is evaluated in both native and non-native ROS environments.
    The ROS uses a publisher-subscriber model for communication between different
    components that constitute the robot. Two nodes that exchange node information
    via the master node communicate messages using the publishing and subscribing
    functions as required. The security analysis shows that ROS lacks the essential
    security elements, and malicious nodes can also be connected in addition to the
    normal nodes. Moreover, breaking into the network is simple, and false injection
    and masquerade attacks are also possible. The false data can be transferred to
    the subscriber if the attack publisher establishes communication (through the
    master node) with the subscriber about the topic. In case of a successful attack,
    the attacker can destroy the system if the flight controller cannot control the
    altitude and exact position in the underlying environment. 5.3. Cyber countermeasures
    5.3.1. Cryptography and key management As explained in Section 4.4 and Section
    5.2, the communication links in IoD are unencrypted and could be compromised.
    To deal with this issue, it is important to deploy cryptography-based mechanisms
    that ensure secure communication among the entities of the IoD. IoD''s cryptography
    and key management solutions are summarized in Table 10. Ozmen et al. [230] proposed
    IoD-Crypt, a lightweight self-certified cryptographic system that aims to meet
    the requirements of resource-constrained IoD. IoD-Crypt is shown to ensure authentication
    and confidentiality of communication. It also reduces the certification overhead,
    i.e., it incurs up to 13 and 48 times less energy consumption than public-key
    primitives on two common drone processors, namely 8-bit AVR and 32-bit ARM, respectively.
    Haque et al. [106] proposed an Identity-Based Encryption (IBE) that offers better
    overhead efficiency as it does not need to use certificates as in public-key systems.
    It also employs a selective encryption algorithm that only encrypts some parts
    of the messages, which incurs less overhead. In addition, data hiding is also
    used to improve the confidentiality of messages. Wang et al. [309] proposed a
    handover key management scheme for the LTE-based UAV control network. To perform
    initial authentication, they employed the authentication and key agreement procedure
    and root key agreement between a UAV and Ground Relay Station (GRS). When a UAV
    moves from a GRS to a neighboring GRS, a new Access Stratum (AS) key is established
    between the UAV and the new GRS and is separated from the old AS. Security analysis
    has shown that the scheme does not reveal the AS key, as it ensures (a) one-hop
    forward and backward key separation and (b) key separation under the compromise
    of the first and the last GRS. Sahingoz [254] proposed a key management system
    for WSNs that leverages a UAV to distribute asymmetric keys to sensor nodes. Neighboring
    sensor nodes authenticate each other through their respective public keys. After
    that, they use the public keys to agree on the pairwise session key for the rest
    of the communication. Chen et al. [57] focused on decoupling the IoD cloud data
    that are stored in the cloud from the owner''s pseudonyms. To this end, they proposed
    a two-tier coding method to mix the user identity with watchword/seed and then
    generate two keys: one key for certification and another one for anonymization.
    Compared to the secure hash-based pseudonym scheme, the network coding method
    can provide unlinkable pseudonyms to unconditional security level for Real-time
    Object Tracking Application (ROTA) [155]. It can also reduce more than 90% of
    processing time and 10% of energy consumption. Demeri et al. [72] designed and
    implemented Secure Aerial Data Delivery with Lightweight Encryption (SADDLE) on
    Fo450ARF quad-copter drone. SADDLE is a combined public and secret key secure
    data delivery system to generate bi-nodal secret session keys. To this end, some
    encryption primitives are used, such as Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key
    exchange protocol and Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-128). Alrayes et al. [17]
    applied Artificial Gorilla Troops Optimizer (AGTO) algorithm with an ECC-Based
    ElGamal encryption technique to generate an optimal key. The latter is used by
    drone-based emergency monitoring systems to encrypt the transmitted images. Simulation
    analysis showed that the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and the mean square
    error (MSE) were improved under all images compared to other optimization algorithms.
    5.3.2. Authentication and access control As shown in Section 4.4, the signals
    are unauthenticated, and it is impossible to confirm their authenticity, which
    allows the injection of spoofed signals. To deal with this issue, it is important
    to deploy authentication mechanisms that ensure the authenticity of only legitimate
    entities in the IoD. The authentication and access control solutions for the IoD
    are summarized in Table 11, Table 12 and Table 13. Sun et al. [296] proposed a
    data authentication scheme based on the message authentication code (MAC) for
    UAV communication. The scheme uses two phases: (1) data authentication and (2)
    cluster watermark authentication. The data authentication phase is used at the
    cluster head node to filter out fake packets, while the cluster watermark authentication
    phase is used at the sink node to verify the authenticity and integrity of the
    data. The security analysis shows that Sun et al.''s scheme [296] is robust against
    five attacks, namely data transmission delay, packet forging, data tampering,
    data replay, and selective forwarding. To solve the problem of deauthenticating
    the drone in a hijacked environment, Yoon et al. [333] proposed an authentication
    system for UAV communication. The network model comprises three elements: middleware,
    ground station, and UAVs. The basic idea of the system is to use encrypted channels
    between these parts. Shoufan [279] designed a continuous authentication for UAV
    communication and considers a network model that contains three elements: a UAV,
    a UAV operator, and a radio-control transmitter. The scheme authenticates the
    behavior of the UAV operator defined by the sequence of flight commands sent from
    the operator to the UAVs. Based on the assumption that each operator has a unique
    behavioral pattern, it is possible to identify authorized operators aiming at
    hijacking the UAVs. Cho et al. [61] proposed a secure authentication framework
    named SENTINEL for the IoD infrastructure. SENTINEL framework creates a flight
    profile code for a UAV with a flight schedule. It records the flight profile code
    and its flight schedule in a centralized database accessible by the ground terminals.
    To authenticate the communication between drone and drone, Pu et al. [240] proposed
    a mutual authentication and key agreement scheme, named PMAPD2D, which is used
    to establish a secure session key between drone and drone. Srinivas et al. [289]
    proposed TCALAS, which is a temporal credential-based anonymous lightweight user
    authentication scheme for IoD. TCALAS uses three authentication factors: password,
    mobile device, and biometrics. Ali et al. [11] revealed that Srinivas et al.''s
    scheme [289] cannot withstand stolen verifier attacks. Hence, they proposed an
    improved IoD scheme, iTCALAS, based on the temporal credentials and lightweight
    symmetric key primitives. In order to provide data confidentiality and mutual
    authentication for mobile sinks used in the IoD applications, Ever [80] introduced
    a secure authentication framework, which is based on elliptic-curve cryptosystems.
    Chen et al. [53] proposed a traceable and privacy-preserving authentication, which
    combines hash function, digital signature, and elliptic curve cryptography for
    UAV applications. Mandal et al. [187] presented a user access control scheme based
    on certificateless-signcryption, named CSUAC-IoT. The scheme uses the following
    three authentication factors: a mobile device, personal biometrics, and user''s
    password. To provide the authentication with privacy preservation for IoD, Tian
    et al. [303] proposed an authentication scheme using mobile edge computing. More
    precisely, Tian et al.''s scheme [303] considers three significant elements, i.e.,
    UAVs, mobile edge computing devices, and a trusted authority. Based on the online/offline
    signature, one-time random nonces, and timestamps, Tian et al.''s scheme can detect
    replay attacks and provide security on repudiation threats. Besides, to authenticate
    the IoT devices in air-ground collaborative surveillance operations, Cao et al.
    [45] proposed a lightweight authentication scheme, which is based on covert channels
    in the physical layer. The network model considers two types of devices, namely,
    1) smart devices and 2) dumb devices. To resist against four attacks, including
    man-in-the-middle attack, message replay attack, impersonation attack, and eavesdrop
    attack, Cao et al.''s scheme [45] combines the benefits of two concepts: covert
    channels and physical layer fingerprints. Zhang et al. [344] proposed a lightweight
    authentication and key agreement scheme based on the bitwise XOR operations and
    only secure one-way hash function. Wang et al. [309] provided an LTE-based architecture
    to enhance the coordination of UAV control. Then, they presented a scheme of transfer
    key control for the LTE-based UAV control network. The security analyses show
    that the proposed scheme ensures the security of a communication key of a ground
    relay station in service, although the neighboring GRSes are affected. To support
    user revocation, non-repudiation, and authenticated key agreement for the IoD,
    Won et al. [321] proposed a certificateless signcryption tag key encapsulation
    mechanism named eCLSC-TKEM, which is based on a certificateless data aggregation
    protocol. Wazid et al. [317] proposed a lightweight user authentication system
    where a user in the IoD environment requires access to the data directly from
    a UAV. The proposed system can resist node/sensing device/drone impersonation
    attacks. Alladi et al. [13] proposed a two-stage lightweight mutual authentication
    scheme for SDN-backed multi-UAV networks, which can provide independent aliasing,
    perfect forward secrecy, and perfect backward secrecy. Hong et al. [113] proposed
    a data aggregate authentication scheme, named IBE-AggAuth, for unmanned aerial
    vehicle cluster networks. The IBE-AggAuth scheme uses ID-based encryption and
    the elliptic curve computational Diffie-Hellman method to reduce computation and
    communication costs and provide data security. To enable real-time performance
    for autonomous safety flight, Cheon et al. [59] do not keep the secret keys for
    encryption on the drone. Instead, they proposed a linearly homomorphic authenticated
    encryption scheme named LinHAE. This scheme is secure against eavesdropping and
    forgery attacks. Bera et al. [38] proposed ACPBS-IoT, an access control protocol
    for battlefield surveillance in drone-assisted IoT. ACPBS-IoT ensures mutual authentication
    between a drone and a GCS and shares a session key. Security analysis shows that
    ACPBSIoT can resist different attacks, including impersonation, privileged-insider,
    replay attack, man-in-the-middle attack, and Ephemeral Secret Leakage (ESL) attacks.
    Ko et al. [147] proposed a security protocol for military applications, consisting
    of two components: the first establishes authentication among the UAVs, and the
    second ensures authentication between a UAV and the GCS. Formal security analysis
    shows that the protocol can ensure mutual authentication, non-repudiation, perfect
    forward secrecy, and perfect backward secrecy. It can also resist man-in-the-middle
    and DoS attacks. Jan et al. [128] proposed an authentication protocol for IoD
    based on a hash message authentication (HMACSHA1). The protocol incurs less overhead
    with respect to computation and storage and is also formally analyzed and shown
    to be resistant against known attacks such as stolen verifier attacks, privileged
    insider, denial of service, replay, and spoofing attacks. Zhang et al. [341] proposed
    three-factor authentication and key agreement protocol for IoD. The protocol employs
    an elliptic curve function named FourQ and a pre-calculation technique called
    Boyko-Peinado-Venkatesan (BPV). The security analysis shows that the protocol
    ensures essential security properties such as perfect forward secrecy. Experimental
    tests on Raspberry Pi B+ demonstrate that FourQ is five times faster than the
    conventional elliptic curve. Tanveer et al. [300] proposed RAMP-IoD, Robust Authenticated
    Key Management Protocol for IoD. RAMP-IoD is based on two lightweight cryptographic
    primitives: Authenticated Encryption with Associative Data (AEAD) and elliptic
    curve. RAMP-IoD is secure against different attacks, including replay, man-in-the-middle,
    stolen smart device/card, and password-guessing attacks. It also incurs low computation,
    communication, and storage overheads. Khalid et al. [139] proposed a two-factor
    authentication scheme for drones based on an asymmetric cryptographic method.
    The authors showed that the proposed scheme offers less computation cost than
    RAMP-IoD [300] and is resistant to many attacks, such as replay, impersonation,
    and available session keys. Hussain et al. [120] proposed an authentication scheme
    between a pair of users and drones based on symmetric encryption and elliptic
    curve cryptography. Based on formal security analysis, the scheme provides anonymity
    and untraceability and is secure against different attacks, including user/GCS/drone
    impersonation, offline password guessing, and password change. In [323], it was
    shown that Hussain et al.''s scheme is vulnerable to drone capture, privileged
    insider, and session key disclosure attacks. Chaudhry et al. [51] designed GCACS-IoD,
    a certificate-based access control scheme that provides two types of authentication:
    inter-drone and drone to the ground station. The scheme can resist replay, drone
    capture, drone impersonation, man-in-the-middle, and temporary secret leakage
    attacks. In [70], it was proved that GCACS-IoD is insecure against private key
    leakage of the control server. Nikooghadam et al. [223] proposed an authentication
    scheme for drone-assisted smart city surveillance. The scheme is based on elliptic
    curve cryptography, which considers three elements: users, drones, and control
    servers. It provides anonymity and perfect forward secrecy while incurring low
    computation and communication overhead. Jan et al. [127] proposed a scheme focusing
    on information authentication instead of identity authentication. They assumed
    that initially, the users, the drones, and the ground control station mutually
    authenticate each other. The scheme is resistant to drone capture, man-in-the-middle,
    stolen verifier, replay, user impersonation, server impersonation, and privileged
    insider attacks. It also incurs less storage and computation overheads. 5.3.3.
    Blockchain-based solutions Blockchain technology can be effectively applied in
    almost all domains, especially for the IoD [14], [82], [84], [87]. To address
    the security vulnerabilities in the IoD, the blockchain technology [193] is a
    feasible solution with enormous potential. Sharma et al. [276] proposed a neural-blockchain
    combination for edge-enabled UAV networks. The blockchain network is used for
    reliable communications using distributed ledgers, which can help flatten services
    on the IoD. To maintain the reliability requirements of the blockchain network,
    a hybrid neural model is proposed. The operating drones in the defined network
    are configured via the drone caching framework based on the blocks. Ferrag and
    Leandros [83] proposed an intrusion detection and blockchain-based delivery framework,
    named DeliveryCoin, for drone-delivered services. The hash functions and short
    signatures are employed by the blockchain for achieving privacy preservation,
    while the machine learning techniques are employed for intrusion detection. In
    addition, a UAV-aided forwarding mechanism, named pBFTF, is adopted for achieving
    consensus inside the blockchain-based delivery platform. Islam et al. [126] proposed
    a blockchain-enabled data acquisition scheme to provide security and data integrity
    through unmanned aerial vehicle swarm and blockchain technology. Specifically,
    the unmanned aerial vehicle swarm shares a shared key with the IoT devices to
    maintain communications before initiating data acquisition. The digital signature
    algorithm and hash bloom filter are employed in order to resist and avoid two
    types of man-in-the-middle attacks: manipulation and eavesdropping. Fernández-Caramés
    et al. [81] proposed a drone-based and blockchain-based system for Industry 4.0,
    where the drones are used to collect the inventory data, and the blockchain technology
    is used to enable the creation of smart contracts. Aggarwal et al. [7] designed
    a secure data dissemination scheme based on blockchain technology and game theory
    for the IoD. A forger node selection algorithm and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) algorithm
    are employed to verify and validate blocks. Throughout evaluation performance,
    the proposed scheme shows that it can provide identity anonymity, data integrity,
    accountability, authorization, and authentication, compared to four related schemes
    [135], [171], [173], [277]. Bera et al. [37] introduced an access control system
    based on blockchain technology, which can enable safe interaction between UAVs
    as well as between UAVs and the ground station server. The protected data collected
    by the ground station server are used to form transactions, and the latter is
    used to create blocks. The blocks are then added to the blockchain through the
    cloud servers connected to the ground station server via the ripple protocol consensus
    algorithm. Lei et al. [167] proposed an advanced and systematic approach based
    on blockchain technology that incorporates on-demand verification, forwarding
    strategy, and interest-key-content binding to detect poisonous content efficiently.
    In order to support decentralized interest-key-content binding storage and enable
    the detection of internal attackers, the authors developed an adaptive and scalable
    delegated consensus algorithm over named data networking for mission-critical
    unmanned aerial vehicle ad hoc networks. Islam and Shin [124] proposed a secure
    outdoor health monitoring system based on blockchain technology and UAV consolidated
    with MEC. In the proposed system, Health Data (HD) are collected from sensors
    carried by the users, and this health data is forwarded to the next MEC server
    via a UAV. Before being transmitted to MEC, the health data is encrypted to protect
    against cyber attacks. García-Magariño et al. [97] designed an agent-based approach
    based on the blockchain technology and trust policies for ensuring the surveillance
    and security of UAV networks as well as to detect compromised UAVs. For disaster
    rescue, Su et al. [293] proposed a lightweight framework, named LVBS, for secure
    data sharing based on blockchain technology and unmanned aerial vehicles. The
    LVBS framework adopts a credit-based consensus algorithm to safely and immutably
    track node behavior and record data transactions with increased efficiency and
    security to achieve consensus. Islam et al. [123] proposed an intelligent surveillance
    architecture based on blockchain technology, in which a drone monitors and uses
    a two-phase authentication process to check vehicles at sea. The experimental
    results demonstrate that the proposed authentication scheme is significantly faster
    and uses less power than existing authentication schemes. Islam and Shin [125]
    proposed a blockchain-based data acquisition scheme, in which data are first encrypted
    and then transferred to the MEC server with the help of a UAV. Han et al. [105]
    used blockchain technology to detect global navigation satellite system signal
    attacks for UAV networks. Mitra et al. [199] implemented a public blockchain-based
    testbed for drone-assisted wildlife monitoring. The drones collect data from IoT
    devices, which are attached to animals. The collected data of each flying zone
    is sent to its corresponding Ground Station Server (GSS). The latter creates blocks
    and validates them using the Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) consensus
    algorithm. To this end, the GSS broadcasts the block to the P2P network of GSS
    nodes. Alsamhi [18] focused on the synergy between federated learning and blockchain
    in IoD. The drones collect data from the smart environment, run local models,
    and share the models with their neighbors and ground server to allow collaborative
    learning and improve model accuracy. The role of blockchain is to allow privacy-preserving
    data sharing in the IoD. Irshad et al. [122] proposed a BOD5-IOD, blockchain-oriented
    Data Delivery and Collection (DDC) system to ensure authentication between drones
    and their corresponding ground control servers. The DDC records all the transactions
    among the system nodes and generates their private blocks. In [23], the blockchain
    model was proposed to hide the identity of drones during message exchanges. Sing
    et al. [283] defined an architecture named blockchain of drones, where each drone
    creates blocks and communicates with other drones and the ground station. They
    proposed the Advanced Byzantine Fault Tolerance (ABFT) protocol as a consensus
    mechanism for blockchain. ABFT offers higher scalability than other Byzantine
    Fault Tolerance (BFT) systems like PBFT (Practical BFT), hBFT, and ReBFT. Nguyen
    et al. [221] proposed a blockchain-based architecture for conducting search and
    rescue missions using IoD. The architecture consists of small and big drones and
    edge servers to perform offloading operations. Allouch et al. [15] proposed UTM-Chain,
    a blockchain-based solution for unmanned traffic management. UTM-Chain provides
    secure sharing of data between UAVs and their ground control stations. In [71],
    blockchain and EdgeDrone concept [210] are integrated to ensure secure data delivery
    for forest fire surveillance applications. The authors in [195] proposed PROACT:
    a lightweight consensus protocol for IoD based on accumulated trust [196]. The
    blockchain is maintained and updated by the GCSs and the cloud servers. Certain
    GCSs are selected to become BC miners based on their trust ratings. Each GCS validates
    the transactions that it receives from drones before forwarding them to the set
    of trusted GCSs (TGCSs), which act as miners. The trusted GCSs assume the responsibility
    of mining new blocks, while all GCSs participate in the process of block validation.
    Each GCS accumulates trust points in order to become a TGCS. Each time a GCS validates
    a transaction correctly, it receives positive trust points and vice versa. When
    the GCS accumulates enough trust points over a sufficiently long period, it is
    selected by the TGCSs to become a BC miner. One of the TGCSs acts as the blockchain
    orderer that receives block requests from the TGCSs and orders the corresponding
    blocks in the blockchain, which allows multiple TGCSs to produce their blocks
    and add them to the blockchain in parallel. A TGCS collects the transactions from
    its drones, sends a request to the blockchain orderer, creates its block, and
    waits for its turn to add the block to the blockchain. When its turn arrives,
    the TGCS adds the previous block''s hash to its block and broadcasts the latter
    to the TGCSs to add it to the blockchain. 5.3.4. Intrusion detection systems As
    presented in Section 4.4, some attacks against IoD, such as DoS attacks, cannot
    be prevented. Hence, there is a need for an intrusion detection system (IDS),
    which is the second line of defense when the intruder has already entered the
    network and tampers with its performance. IDSs can generally be classified as
    rule-based or misuse detection, where the former lie on specific rules that define
    the presence of an intruder, and the latter learn the regular operation of the
    system and trigger an alarm once a deviation happens. Most of the traditional
    techniques mentioned in the literature suffer from either poor performance or
    high overhead [73]. Once an IDS is deployed in such a complex system, like the
    IoD, the produced alarms must be both highly accurate to improve the security
    system''s performance and minimal in order not to affect the correct performance
    of control applications that run over the medium. Recently, several works have
    investigated the efficiency of an IDS for detecting attacks in a UAV environment.
    The different IDS methods, which are proposed for securing UAVs, are presented
    in Table 14. Yu et al. [335] applied snort for DoS and GPS spoofing attack detection
    in a simulated environment comprising a GCS and a limited number of UAVs. Condomines
    et al. [67] conducted both simulated and emulated tests, using paparazziUAV [1],
    an open-source drone hardware and software project encompassing autopilot system
    to better represent realistic scenarios and test the efficiency of their proposed
    defense mechanism. They used network traffic datasets that include anomalies to
    construct digital signatures in three dimensions for DoS attacks and used those
    signatures to detect future attacks. Although the proposed method is designed
    to detect both constant and progressive flash crowds, it was tested under simplistic
    scenarios with one attack and a limited number of valid nodes. Hoang et al. [112]
    presented an IDS that combines OCSVM and K-means clustering in a UAV-aided wireless
    system, an idea that was presented a couple of years ago for detecting anomalies
    in Industrial Control Systems (ICS) [183]. The proposed method is tested on a
    scenario consisting of three nodes: one of them is the attacker, and only a passive
    attack occurs (i.e., the eavesdropping attack). Arthur [26] presented a lightweight
    system that can be embedded in modern UAVs for providing accurate detection of
    GPS spoofing and DoS attack, as well as consuming little energy from the UAV.
    The IDS combines Self-Taught Learning (STL) with a multiclass SVM to detect the
    attacker. It is tested in a realistic environment that consists of twenty UAVs,
    four Ground Stations, and a Control Station, making the results valuable. To secure
    UAVs that carry out explorations in isolated areas and to collect and send critical
    information about the conditions of these areas, Sedjelmaci et al. [266] implemented
    and tested several IDSs that can deal with many different attacks, achieving good
    accuracy with low false positives. Fotohi [90] proposed a novel IDS that can secure
    UAVs against several attacks, but at the cost of high communication overhead among
    nodes, to identify secure routes. Also, the proposed IDS assumes that this secure
    route will not change in the next communication attempt, which is not so realistic
    in highly mobile environments like UAVs. Sun et al. [295] proposed an IDS based
    on the Bayesian Nash equilibrium theory. The proposed IDS performs well in terms
    of accuracy, detection rate, and overhead compared to other methods, but the validation
    was based on probabilistic models rather than realistic datasets. In another work
    [292], the authors presented a theoretical model of IDS based on a Blackboard
    architecture, but no validation or evaluation results are provided. Zhang et al.
    [342] presented an IDS based on Wavelet Leader Multifractal analysis for creating
    signatures of traffic and evaluated their method in a hybrid experimental system
    using real traces. The method performs well under DoS service attacks showing
    high similarity rates, but no comparison with other methods is presented. Deep
    learning can achieve better performance as compared to traditional machine learning
    IDSs, especially when massive data analysis is required [336], and thus can be
    used to develop IDSs for modern complex systems where massive, high-dimensional,
    nonlinear data must be used for training, and testing [299]. Authors in [85] conducted
    a comparative study of several deep learning IDS techniques using novel datasets
    and tried to showcase the pros and cons of each method. As also stated in [10],
    [86], [306], no method can be considered as the ‘winner’ for all attacks'' scenarios,
    and smart combinations of techniques could be used to detect most of the abnormal
    situations inside the system accurately. Ramadan et al. [241] proposed a distributed
    IDS that is deployed on drones and the base station. Each drone runs the LSTM-RNN
    model to detect the attacks on the drone itself. The base station also runs the
    LSTM-RNN model to confirm the detected attack and notify the other drones. The
    authors tested their model on different datasets such as KDDCup 99, NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15,
    Kyoto, CICIDS2017, and TON_IoT. Recently, the authors in [228] proposed a model
    based on machine learning techniques and a multi-agent system that is capable
    of detecting DoS attacks against drones. The detection of DoS attacks is an important
    countermeasure that can be used to ensure the high availability of drone systems,
    especially those used in emergencies. The proposed method was tested using the
    CICIDS2017 dataset and was proven to be very accurate. In another recent work,
    [30], the authors applied machine learning-based classification techniques to
    detect several attacks against drones. The authors used the DJI Phantom 4 drone
    dataset acquired from VTO Labs in this work. This dataset comprises DAT files
    of flight logs obtained from various flights undertaken by a single drone. The
    evaluation of several methods showed the superiority of the random forest algorithm.
    Finally, the authors in [320] combined principal component analysis (PCA) and
    one-class classifiers to detect attacks to be able to train the IDS using only
    normal data. The proposed MAVIDS can be deployed on every UAV allowing for fast
    detection and potential mitigation of cyber attacks even during communication
    errors with the GCS. 5.3.5. Drone forensics Drone forensics is an emerging field
    within digital forensics aiming to extract and analyze evidence from a UAV and
    its components to identify attackers and their malicious actions [8]. Drone forensics
    is essential as the drone flies above populated areas and can be manipulated by
    radical forces and perpetrators to launch illegal activities. Although forensics
    investigation is well established in traditional fields, there is a lack of a
    standard regarding the procedures of collecting and processing evidence for a
    security incident in the IoD field [189]. Due to the nature of the IoD environment,
    several challenges obstruct the standardization of forensics procedures. First,
    several drone platforms and architectures make it difficult to build a standard
    procedure that can be applied to these various architectures and platforms. Moreover,
    the presence of several components and devices in the drone expands the complexity
    of the investigation, as the forensics analysis will have to handle the supporting
    devices and find and correlate the evidence collected from these different devices.
    Furthermore, IoD systems are generally linked to the cloud to offload resource
    taxing tasks [47]. This property moves the processing and handling of data from
    the drone to the cloud, and therefore, extends the perimeter of the incident investigation.
    Moreover, cloud service providers rarely cooperate with investigators, and even
    if cloud providers are willing to cooperate, the data may be stored across different
    servers and countries. This requires the permissions granted to different entities
    and authorities [189]. In what follows, we present the main forensics methods
    proposed for drones. These methods are summarized in Table 15. Clark et al. [65]
    noted that the DJI Phantom III drone was used in several illegal activities such
    as dropping bombs, remote surveillance, and plane watching. This motivated the
    authors to develop a DRone Open source Parser called DROP, which can analyze proprietary
    encrypted DAT files extracted from the drone''s internal storage. The extracted
    data can identify drone locations over time and the flying time. However, this
    work is limited to only DJI drones. Renduchintala et al. [245] proposed a more
    comprehensive forensic framework. The authors first divided drone forensics into
    two categories: digital forensics and hardware/physical vehicle forensics. Digital
    forensics includes analyzing network traffic exchanged by drones, system logs,
    sensor readings, file storage systems, and camera recordings. As for hardware
    forensics, it includes: identifying drone type, checking for customization, carrying
    loads, fingerprints, and location. The authors proposed a forensic model to examine
    the drone''s physical components. They developed a Java-based application to analyze
    and visualize the flight logs of the drones. However, this work is limited to
    only log files in CSV file format. Iqbal et al. [121] investigated a Parrot Bebop
    2 drone to acquire flight data, extract drone-pruned media, and establish ownership.
    However, their work is limited to small-scale drones. Barton and Azhar [32] and
    [29] used Kali Linux to provide open-source forensic tools to perform forensic
    analysis using two drones, namely DJI Phantom 3 and A.R Drone. To visualize the
    flight path, the open-source GeoPlayer tool was used. To this end, the authors
    analyzed and investigated the recorded flight logs on both the internal memory
    of the UAV and the controlling application. Horsman [114] provided the results
    of a digital forensic investigation of a test Parrot Bebop UAV and was able to
    recover flight data using Android and iOS devices. Roder et al. [247] proposed
    a guideline for drone forensics using DJI Phantom 3 drone as a case study. Salamh
    et al. [256] discuss the static and live digital evidence challenges related to
    UAV and possible Anti-UAV forensic techniques. In [255], the authors presented
    a technical forensic process for analyzing digital evidence, which is extracted
    from the Yuneec Typhoon H drone. Kao et al. [134] collected and analyzed artifacts
    from the recorded flight data extracted from the DJI Spark drone and its associated
    devices, such as SD cards and mobile phones. Stanković et al. [290] conducted
    a forensics investigation of DJI Mini 2 and its associated data, which are stored
    on mobile devices and SD cards. Yousef et al. [334] extracted and analyzed data
    from four drones: DJI Mavic 2 Pro, DJI Mavic Air, DJI Spark, and DJI Phantom 4.
    The analysis results indicate that applying forensics on these drones is not easy
    due to their improved security. Hence, it is essential to develop novel forensic
    processes and tools. In [231], the authors analyzed the digital evidence like
    log files, pictures, and videos from the storage of the Yuneec Typhoon drone.
    Kumar et al. [161] focused on analyzing GPS logs from drones to identify the crime
    location and previous flight paths. To this end, they developed a tool designed
    for three drone models: DJI Phantom 4 Pro, Yuneec Typhoon H, and Parrot Bebop
    2, which converts GPS data to an understandable format. Husnjak et al. [119] found
    a significant amount of data by applying a forensic investigation on DJI Mavic
    Air and its associated mobile app DJI GO 4. Salamh et al. [257] tested available
    forensic software tools on two drone models: Phantom 4 and Matrice 210. In [75],
    different open-source tools are applied to the GCS of a Parrot Bebop drone. 5.4.
    Physical countermeasures Collision avoidance is one of the challenges faced by
    UAVs. In shared airspace, a UAV can collide with both stationary and moving obstacles
    and other aircraft, which would endanger its mission. On the other hand, when
    assigning a mission to UAVs with a planned path over multiple waypoints to a drone
    connected to the Internet, the UAV could encounter obstacles not considered in
    the planned trajectory. Indeed, several collision avoidance methods have been
    put forward for the collision problem. In addition, the extensive use of drones
    has created safety threats, which have increased the number of drones that cause
    accidents and unforeseen incidents. These issues have highlighted the need for
    methods intended to track and detect drones used for malicious activities. 5.4.1.
    Collision avoidance methods The collision avoidance methods fall into four categories,
    namely path planning approach, geometric-based approach, potential field approach,
    and vision-based approach. (i) Path planning approach: It aims to find a short
    and collision-free flight trajectory towards the desired target where obstacles
    are static and pre-known. In general, path planning approaches are further divided
    into the following three categories of algorithms [244], [286], [330], [346]:
    • Graph-based algorithms: Graph-based search algorithms have become popular in
    route planning. This method divides the search space into a grid and represents
    the grid by a set of cells. Among the most relevant methods, we can find Djikstra''s
    algorithm [192], [215], A* [184], Lazy θ* [218], D*-Lite [96], [115], [207], and
    the Kinematic A* [6]. These algorithms are applied to the UAV path planning [192]
    because they provide fast search capabilities but do not produce smooth trajectories
    and are not suitable for large areas. • Randomly sampling search algorithms: In
    this category, the environment is sampled into a set of nodes that randomly search
    for a free-collision path. Algorithms like Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT)
    [94], [260], [328], [329], Dynamic Domain RRT (DDRRT) [328], RRT* [76], [319],
    Probabilistic Roadmap (PRM) [6], Rapidly exploring Random Belief Tree (RRBT) [5],
    and Visibility Graph [117] belong to randomly sampling search algorithms and have
    been used in the UAV domain. Random sampling search algorithms give the advantages
    of having a simple structure and dealing with a complex environment. • Learning
    based algorithms: They have become the most popular way to perform UAV path planning.
    The key idea in learning-based algorithms is to use a training process to guide
    the UAV in a given state. Learning-based methods give the advantage of solving
    complex and multi-objective problems. Some evolutionary methods have been adopted
    for the solution of UAV path planning. For instance, genetic algorithms have been
    used for single and multiple UAV path-planning [200], [222], [235], [253], [288],
    [316], which led to satisfactory results. The successful application of reinforcement
    learning for UAV path planning can be found in [49], [237], [313], [315], [340],
    [343]. Other interesting approaches include the usage of neural networks in UAV
    path planning [98], [137], [158], [172]. (ii) Geometric approach: This approach
    aims to avoid conflicts, and collisions based on geometric characteristics analysis
    [40], [232]. There are two geometric collision avoidance techniques: collision
    cone and velocity obstacle. The collision-cone-based technique is suitable for
    detecting and avoiding collision between UAVs and obstacles. Both of them move
    in a dynamic environment [46], [68], [209], [270]. Velocity obstacle techniques
    are successful at computing collision-free trajectories in a dynamic environment
    [16], [88], [129], [163]. (iii) Potential field approach: One successful approach
    used in collision avoidance is the potential field approach. Many researchers
    use it to solve the collision avoidance problem among UAVs and obstacles. This
    approach treats each UAV as a charged particle, and the repulsive forces between
    aircraft generate collision avoidance maneuvers. The potential field method has
    the advantage of simple implementation and low computational complexity and is
    a good solution for real-time implementation. Indeed, it was applied to UAV navigation
    [4], [55], [56], [145], [176], [179], [182], [208], [234], [246], [251], [268],
    [294]. However, it is not appropriate for a dynamic environment due to the existence
    of local minimum risks and poor performance. (iv) Vision-based approach: Different
    vision-based obstacle detection methods have been proposed to tackle the collision
    avoidance problem. Many researchers utilized images captured by cameras mounted
    on UAVs to solve the collision avoidance problem in the indoor environment [262].
    Other works, such as in [48], [115], [186], [191], [242], [263], used a technique
    based on stereo cameras to predict the closeness of the obstacles to the UAV.
    This method requires a high computational cost, which is unsuitable for handling
    real-time situations. Due to the heavy computational capabilities, a simple vision-based
    collision avoidance approach was proposed in [9], [22], [95], [138], [148], [202],
    [252], which uses a monocular camera to generate a collision-free trajectory,
    where heavyweight computations are performed off-board. 5.4.2. Drone detection
    methods The drone detection methods are divided into the following two categories:
    acoustic and optical. (i) Acoustic detection: Several works have proposed the
    use of acoustic sensors, as an efficient technology, to detect drones. Some studies
    compare acoustic signatures generated by drone''s motors and rotating propellers
    with other collected sound signatures [24], [39], [50], [109], [198], [267], [278].
    Other studies detect the sound of propellers and motors based on special microphones
    [108], [144]. The sound is analyzed, and acoustic features are extracted. However,
    weather conditions and noise affect the accuracy of detection. Moreover, the detection
    range is limited. (ii) Optical detection: It is worth mentioning that most of
    the literature has considered image data and video streams collected from cameras
    for drone detection. As an example, studies in [175], [250], [298] focus on detecting
    drones through image processing based on machine learning algorithms. Other studies
    detect UAVs by detecting motion cues [116], [249], visual marks [259], shape descriptors
    [305] and flight pattern. In terms of advantages, camera-based detection enables
    long-range detection. However, detection performances are poor in bad weather
    conditions. 5.5. Regulations and standards In order to protect both safety and
    privacy of the citizens, the EU and USA are putting into force regulations and
    laws. Besides safeguarding their citizens'' lives, drones'' free circulation within
    their territories is one of the primary targets of these regulations. In the EU,
    new drone rules came into force on the 1st of July, 2020. To be allowed to fly
    over the EU, both technical and operational requirements define minimum safety
    capabilities that a drone must have, like identification, certification, and remote
    pilot requirements. Moreover, operators of drones have to register in any of the
    Member States [201]. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the US has issued
    several restrictions on drone operations compared to the European environment.
    Pilots must obtain a Part 107 (certificate for commercial drone operations) certificate
    and register their UAVs to be allowed to fly over USA [197]. On top of the rules
    mentioned above, the UAV sector, especially in the EU, is affected by other regulations.
    These include the Recommendation on Cybersecurity of 5G Networks, General Data
    Protection Regulation (GDPR), the NIS Directive (involves the aviation sector),
    the Electronic Communications Code (involves electronics communications), and
    the Cyber Security Act (involves cyber security certification of devices and applications)
    that cover different aspects of security and privacy, which are all directly or
    indirectly connected to a UAV. Especially regarding the cybersecurity Act, UAVs
    will need to be certified by a National Certification Authority in terms of cyber
    security, following the certification framework that the EU is building [33].
    6. Open issues and future directions Although several solutions have been proposed
    to address the security and safety of IoD, some issues are still open and need
    the efforts of researchers and industry personnel. 6.1. Tracking and compliance
    for drone-to-everything services using blockchain technology The tracking of components
    that go into drone-to-everything services is critical for ensuring safety and
    regulatory compliance. Blockchain technology can be used to store IoT data on
    shared blockchain ledgers, enabling all parties to identify the origin of components
    throughout the drone''s life. The security and privacy of sharing this information
    should be carefully investigated. The key security issue is performing secure,
    easy, and cost-effective access authentication and authorization for drone-to-everything
    services. In addition, the drivers'' mobility pattern is a crucial privacy issue
    that an attacker can learn and use for tracking the component that goes into drone-to-everything
    services. Thus, exploring efficient and privacy-preserving schemes based on blockchain
    technology is crucial to secure component tracking and compliance. 6.2. Novel
    intrusion detection systems Most IDS solutions in IoD focus on detecting intrusions
    related to wireless communications among UAVs and the ground station, but they
    do not cover other intrusions associated with the compromise of the ground control
    station, the drone, or intrusions that bypass the cloud system to manipulate stored
    data. Thus, future research should focus on designing novel IDSs that consider
    the following: • Extension of IDS research: It is recommended that future research
    extend the IDSs to secure other components of IoD, such as drones, ground control
    systems, and cloud servers, and investigate their performance in detecting attacks.
    Another important aspect is the constant change of the network topology, similar
    to a vehicular network [151]. Methods that can cope with the highly dynamic situations
    must be developed [291] and tested in realistic scenarios, taking into consideration
    the interconnection with other systems as well. • IDS Dataset for IoD: Most IDSs
    are tested on network simulators or evaluated using real experiments. They are
    not tested on drone datasets, except for Baig et al. [30] that used DJI Phantom
    4 drone dataset. As presented in Section 5.3.4, the IDSs for IoD are tested under
    non-IoD network traffic datasets such as KDDCup99, NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, Kyoto,
    and CICIDS2017. Similar to IDSs in different fields [140], [149], [165], [269],
    the research community needs to create a Benchmark IDS dataset [281] for IoD,
    which consists of attacks and legitimate traffic and considers specific features
    of a UAV. This will help attract research attention in designing, evaluating,
    and comparing different IDS solutions for IoD. • Adversarial learning: Adversarial
    machine learning is a technique that aims to deceive the learning model by manipulating
    the input data, which causes the model to misclassify the data. Adversarial attacks
    on IDSs in IoD must also be investigated, similar to the work presented in [25],
    where attackers manipulated the IDS itself to report false alarms, either negative
    or positive. As many IDSs are designed based on machine learning, future research
    should focus on fortifying the IDS by generating adversarial samples through Generative
    Adversarial Networks (GANs) and training the IDS model on them. 6.3. Security
    and safety co-engineering lifecycle management Secure software development lifecycle
    (SSDL) is a framework that integrates security into the different phases of the
    software development lifecycle, i.e., requirements, design, implementation, verification,
    and release. Development of safety and security co-engineering lifecycle has already
    been addressed in cyber-physical systems and embedded systems [239], [264], [285],
    [304], which integrates safety and security development lifecycle in a coordinated
    way. Likewise, this integration could be considered as a research direction in
    the context of IoDs by focusing on three levels: risk analysis, countermeasures,
    and testing. 6.3.1. Interdependent security and safety risks The interdependencies
    between cyber and safety risks examine how cyberattacks affect the physical world
    and compromise safety properties. Similarly, they examine how safety risks compromise
    cyber security objectives. In [157], several risk analysis approaches integrating
    security and safety risks have been proposed for cyber-physical systems. In the
    context of IoD, it is recommended to follow the same approach by jointly analyzing
    aspects related to security and safety. To this end, many formal methods can be
    leveraged, such as fault tree analysis and attack tree analysis, that consider
    both security and safety. 6.3.2. Interdependent security and safety countermeasures
    Kriaa et al. [157] defined four types of security-safety interactions, i.e., conditional
    dependency (fulfillment of security requirements conditions safety and vice versa),
    mutual reinforcement (fulfillment of safety requirements contributes to security,
    or vice-versa), antagonism (safety and security requirements or measures lead
    to conflicting situations), and independency (there are no interactions between
    security and safety). Research efforts should consider conditional dependency
    and antagonism interactions. One example of security conditioning safety is that
    an IPS/IDS incorrectly classifies regular messages as malicious. Hence, it could
    affect the correct functionality of drones and compromise their safety. 6.3.3.
    Combined security and safety testing Before deploying the different components
    of IoD, it is of paramount importance to test them to ensure that security and
    safety requirements are met. It has been shown in [157] that there are four types
    of interactions between security and safety. Similar to other domains [285], it
    would be recommended to develop testing and validation methodologies that combine
    security and safety properties in IoD. 6.4. Formal verification of IoD security
    As discussed in this survey, the IoD represents a complex cyber-physical system
    that combines diverse multidisciplinary techniques. Therefore, governing the security
    issue of this system remains challenging. One research area that needs the focus
    of academic and industrial researchers is the formal validation of designed protocols
    and techniques, especially those related to security and safety. More precisely,
    proposed security and safety solutions must be formally proved secure to avoid
    disastrous consequences, primarily when IoD is used in civilian applications.
    The modeling of security solutions must consider the complex aspects of the UAV
    as a standalone system and the network aspects when drones operate as a connected
    fleet. The actual adoption of IoD in civil applications has revealed that drones
    can operate well alone but fail to handle network-based attacks. 6.5. UAV integration
    with other networks The IoD is integrated with different networks, such as 5G,
    IoT, Wi-Fi, and vehicular networks. This integration allows using drones as a
    supporting platform to improve communication performance and network coverage.
    On the other hand, the combined network will be exposed to emerging and complex
    attacks originating from IoD to harm other networks and vice-versa. These emerging
    attacks should be investigated using different methods, such as attack trees and
    attack graph analysis. This integration also requires rethinking the protocols
    to cope with the resource-constrained drones. We identify two types of protocols:
    the drones could switch to different networks during their missions, and hence
    they should ensure seamless, secure communication and continuous connectivity.
    The IoD could play the role of a relay between nodes in a network, e.g., vehicular
    networks. It is crucial to design an integration architecture that considers end-to-end
    communication and authentication protocols executed across heterogeneous networks.
    6.6. Lightweight cryptographic operations In IoD, messages are continuously exchanged
    between the drones and the GCS, which incurs high communication overhead. As drones
    operate on battery and can fly long distances, they require lightweight cryptographic
    protocols to secure IoD communication. To this end, some techniques could be investigated
    such as single-round function [224], or lightweight quantum cryptography [162],
    [170]. As IoD is characterized by highly dynamic topology, a dynamic cryptographic
    approach could also be investigated [194]. It has been recommended in [173] that
    drones should use homomorphic encryption to aggregate several ciphertexts into
    a single ciphertext without the need for decryption. More efforts could be made
    to further improve the efficiency of homomorphic encryption algorithms in IoD
    by getting inspiration from other works [104], [107], [287]. 6.7. Malware detection
    and prevention It has been shown that drones could be infected by malware [226].
    However, there is no existing research on detecting drone malware. In [297], the
    malware classification model is proposed for ground control stations, but it was
    not tested on a drone malware dataset. Instead, it was tested on the Microsoft
    malware classification challenge dataset [225]. Malware detection is an old topic
    that has been well-investigated by academia and industry. The detection of malicious
    software depends on the operating system and requires specific detection features.
    For instance, to detect a WIN32 malicious application, the anti-malware solution
    [100] needs to use features like opcodes, bytecodes, Portable Executable (PE)
    metadata, and API calls. In the case of Android OS, anti-malware solutions [136]
    extract features like permissions, intents, and API calls to distinguish between
    benign and malicious mobile applications. The embedded applications in the drone
    run on specific operating systems such as RTOS [181]. Hence, to detect malicious
    drones, the anti-malware solution has to consider features specific to the drone
    OS, such as API calls and drone navigation state with respect to altitude, position,
    velocity, acceleration, and orientation [132]. Therefore, it is recommended that
    the research community investigate the topic of drone malware detection. In fact,
    there is still room for contributions by taking inspiration from other solutions
    in the literature. They can explore different approaches, such as malware detection
    using static and/or dynamic analysis of the code, signature-based detection, anomaly-based
    detection, supervised and unsupervised learning, etc. Cybercriminals have widely
    used ransomware against desktop, mobile, IoT, and vehicle platforms [31], [54],
    [118], [205], [229]. The aim is to encrypt data or lock access to a system until
    the victim pays a ransom. We predict that a ransomware threat that targets drones
    could emerge in the short term, but by taking another form, i.e., the cybercriminal
    hijacks the drone and releases it when a ransom is paid. The research community
    could think about this issue in advance, inspired by earlier works, and come up
    with a malware detection system that monitors the behavior of the compromised
    application, and identifies the suspicious API calls in the early stages before
    the ransomware attack happens. Building a public dataset for drone malware is
    also an option to boost this research direction, as done in other domains such
    as mobile malware [164], [185], [347] and IoT malware [149], [180]. 6.8. Fleet
    of drones security In a fleet of drones, the drones must cooperate to accomplish
    the group mission. If some drones are compromised or faulty, the mission will
    be affected. To deal with this issue, future research efforts should focus on
    three aspects: trust management, federated learning, and privacy-preserving collaborative
    learning. 6.8.1. Trust management To secure IoD security and ensure the fulfillment
    of its mission, it is important to detect compromised/faulty drones and isolate/repair
    them. This can be achieved by implementing a trust management mechanism that observes
    the behavior of drones and assigns trust or reputation values to them, which helps
    identify trustworthy and rogue nodes. Trust management in IoD is not well-investigated
    [91]. To this end, researchers could get inspiration from trust management solutions
    in other fields, such as IoT [20] and vehicular networks [78]. 6.8.2. Federated
    learning Federated learning is a technique that trains machine learning techniques
    across different devices holding local data without exchanging them. The devices
    exchange parameters, i.e., weights and biases in the case of deep learning, to
    build a global model shared by all nodes. For instance, each drone has a different
    mission experience and is targeted by other attacks. Thus, future research should
    investigate how to leverage federated learning and build a more robust collaborative
    IDS by combining the different local models. 6.8.3. Privacy-preserving collaborative
    learning Fleets of drones have to adopt a collaborative model to accomplish their
    missions. This collaboration should ensure the privacy of sensitive data and learning
    models. In [43], three privacy concerns are identified, i.e., concerns related
    to sensitive input data during model training, model prediction, and model sharing
    with other participants. If the learning process in IoD comprises private information,
    these concerns need to be addressed in the future work. 6.9. Policies and regulations
    Governments should adopt some regulations to ensure the safety of people and properties:
    • Firmer laws: Strict laws must be considered to give licenses and authorization
    to people who want to fly drones. Also, there should be punishments for the illegal
    use of drones or when drones fly over vital or forbidden areas. • Implementation
    of in-depth controls: In-depth controls should be implemented to protect people
    and properties from the threats coming from drones, which could result in physical
    damage and human casualties. To this end, controls could be implemented through
    in-depth defense layers: deterrent, preventive, detective, and corrective, i.e.,
    they occur when an issue is detected. • Security governance in IoD: A security
    governance approach should be applied by the organizations that own or operate
    IoD to ensure their cyber and physical security. It involves people''s roles and
    responsibilities, implementation of countermeasures, security and safety testing,
    and incidence response plans in case of a security breach or mission failure.
    Another aspect of security governance is to provide drone security training for
    drone operators so that they can understand the cyber and physical threats, how
    to deal with cyber and physical incidents, how to make the drone return home safely,
    and how to protect the critical infrastructure and assets of the organization
    against malicious drones. 6.10. Incident response and mission continuity Incident
    response and business continuity plans are the key components of security strategies
    in organizations. The incident response aims to respond to and recover from incidents,
    whereas business continuity aims to limit the impact of incidents and ensure the
    timely resumption of essential operations. In the context of IoD, we can inspire
    security strategies to develop an incident response plan that indicates how to
    deal with all incidents that could occur in IoD. As the objective of IoD is to
    accomplish their missions, we can also think about mission continuity instead
    of business continuity to deal with how drones could ensure the timely resumption
    of their operations and missions. To this end, it is vital to think about designing
    fault-tolerant and attack-tolerant solutions that ensure mission continuity. 6.11.
    Ranked open issues in IoD In this section, we suggest ranking the above-mentioned
    topics related to open issues, as shown in Table 16, to identify which topics
    require greater attention from the research community. To this end, we propose
    a formal approach that considers two parameters: • Risk Value: Each one of the
    above topics aims to address some attacks. We give priority to the topics that
    are associated with attacks of higher risk values. We use the risk values that
    are defined in Section 4.6, and range from Insignificant to Extreme, and are assigned
    the following values: Qualitative value Quantitative value Insignificant 1 Low
    2 Medium 3 High 4 Extreme 5 • Countermeasure Effectiveness: Research efforts should
    focus on proposing security countermeasures with higher effectiveness. The countermeasures
    are classified as: preventive, detective, and recovery. – The preventive countermeasures
    are the most effective, as they prevent the occurrence of the incident. – The
    detective countermeasures act when the incident occurs. – The recovery countermeasures
    act after an incident occurs. For each countermeasure type, we assign the following
    effectiveness values: Countermeasure Countermeasure Effectiveness Preventive 3
    Detective 2 Recovery 1 Table 16. Prioritized open issues in IoD. Open issue topic
    Risk Countermeasure Priority Priority Value Effectiveness Importance Ranking Tracking
    and compliance for drone-to-everything services using blockchain technology Insignificant
    Preventive 3 Low  Novel Intrusion Detection Systems Extreme Detective 10 Medium  Security
    and safety co-engineering lifecycle management Extreme Preventive 15 High  Formal
    verification of IoD security Extreme Preventive 15 High  UAV integration with
    other networks Extreme Preventive 15 High  Lightweight cryptographic operations
    Extreme Preventive 15 High  Malware detection and prevention Medium Preventive
    9 Medium  Fleet of drones security Extreme Detective 10 Medium  Policies and regulations
    Extreme Preventive 15 High  Incident response and mission continuity Extreme Recovery
    5 Low We define the Priority Importance using the following formula: Based on
    the Priority Importance value, we define the Priority Ranking of the topic as
    follows: From Table 16, we can observe that most of the topics are associated
    with Extreme risks, which target the drone and its fine-grained assets, as shown
    in Table 8 and Table 9. The risk associated with tracking and compliance for drone-to-everything
    services using blockchain technology topic is insignificant, as it targets blockchain
    services, which are deployed in secure environments. In Table 8, the risk of compromising
    the drone, specifically the flight control system, is Medium. Our proposed ranking
    approach shows that: • The following five topics require high attention: – Security
    and safety co-engineering lifecycle management. – Formal verification of IoD security.
    – UAV integration with other networks. – Lightweight cryptographic operations.
    – Policies and regulations. • The following three topics require medium attention:
    – Novel intrusion detection systems. – Malware detection and prevention. – Fleet
    of drone security. • The following two topics require low attention: – Tracking
    and compliance for drone-to-everything services using blockchain technology. –
    Incident response and mission continuity. 7. Conclusion In this paper, we have
    provided a comprehensive survey related to the cyber and physical security of
    the Internet of Drones (IoD). Previous security-focused surveys on IoD had a limited
    scope and focused on classifying the various attacks and threats with partial
    coverage of cybersecurity countermeasures. We have attempted to address these
    gaps in this survey and presented various novelties that are not present in the
    existing literature. Specifically, we have proposed three taxonomies that are
    related to (i) assets of drones, (ii) attacks, and (iii) countermeasures. The
    proposed taxonomies allow finer-level of granularity for asset identification,
    which enables broader identification of possible attacks. Additionally, we have
    evaluated the IoD risks and identified their impacts using a novel concept, named
    Chain of Impact. We have also proposed a taxonomy of technical and non-technical
    countermeasures according to two implementation phases: Pre-incident and Post-incident.
    In addition, we have presented the countermeasures along with their performance
    results and limitations. Finally, we have identified the open issues and suggested
    future research directions for IoD security. We have ranked the identified open
    issues according to the level of attention they should receive from the research
    community. Particularly, the interaction between security and safety, formal verification
    of IoD security, UAV integration with other networks, lightweight cryptographic
    operations, and policies and regulations should be given the highest priority.

    \ \n1. Introduction\nSmart farming, also known as precision agriculture, is an\
    \ innovative approach to agricultural practices that leverages \nadvanced technologies\
    \ to optimize efficiency, productivity, and sustainability in farming operations\
    \ [1]-[4]. As shown \nin Fig. 1, it involves the integration of various technologies,\
    \ such as Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), \ndata analytics,\
    \ robotics, and remote sensing, to make informed decisions and automate processes\
    \ in agricultural \nsystems. The primary goal of smart farming is to enhance crop\
    \ production, minimize resource waste, reduce \nenvironmental impact, and improve\
    \ overall profitability. By utilizing a network of interconnected devices and\
    \ sensors \n[5], farmers can collect real-time data on various factors such as\
    \ soil moisture levels, weather conditions, crop health, \nand pest infestations.\
    \ This data is then analyzed to provide actionable insights, allowing farmers\
    \ to make data-driven \ndecisions and implement precise interventions [6]-[8].\
    \ \nOne of the key components of smart farming is the use of IoT devices and sensors.\
    \ These devices are deployed \nthroughout the farmland to monitor and control\
    \ different variables [8]-[11]. For instance, soil moisture sensors can \nprovide\
    \ information about the water requirements of crops, enabling farmers to apply\
    \ water precisely where and when \nit is needed, reducing water wastage. Similarly,\
    \ weather stations and satellite imagery can offer accurate and localized \nweather\
    \ data, helping farmers optimize planting schedules and manage crop diseases.\
    \ \nAccording to [12], artificial intelligence plays a crucial role in smart farming\
    \ by analyzing the collected data and \nproviding intelligent recommendations.\
    \ Machine learning algorithms can identify patterns and correlations in the data,\
    \ \nenabling predictive models for crop growth, pest outbreaks, and yield estimation\
    \ [13]-[16]. This information assists \nfarmers in making informed decisions regarding\
    \ the optimal use of fertilizers, pesticides, and other inputs, leading to \n\
    improved resource management and reduced environmental impact. As explained in\
    \ [17], robots and drones can be \nWorld Journal of Advanced Research and Reviews,\
    \ 2023, 18(03), 1207–1231 \n1208 \nutilized in smart farming to automate labor-intensive\
    \ tasks. Robots can perform activities like seeding, weeding, and \nharvesting\
    \ with precision and efficiency, reducing the need for manual labor and increasing\
    \ productivity [18]-[20]. As \nshown in Fig.2, drones equipped with cameras and\
    \ sensors [21] can gather high-resolution images and collect data over \nlarge\
    \ areas, helping farmers monitor crop health, detect early signs of diseases or\
    \ nutrient deficiencies, and identify \nareas requiring attention. \n \nFigure\
    \ 1 Typical smart agriculture scenario \n \nFigure 2 Drones in smart agriculture\
    \ \nResearchers in [22] point out that smart agriculture relies on various sensors\
    \ to collect real-time data about \nenvironmental conditions, crop health, soil\
    \ characteristics, and livestock parameters. These sensors provide critical \n\
    insights that enable farmers to make informed decisions and optimize farming practices.\
    \ As shown in Fig. 3, examples \nof sensors commonly used in smart agriculture\
    \ include weather sensors, soil moisture sensors, soil pH sensors, nutrient \n\
    sensors, crop health sensors, light sensors, livestock monitoring sensors, water\
    \ quality sensors, gas sensors and insect \ntraps sensors. Here, weather sensors\
    \ measure atmospheric conditions such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, wind\
    \ \nspeed, and solar radiation [23]–[26]. They help farmers understand weather\
    \ patterns, predict storms, and optimize \nirrigation schedules based on evapo-transpiration\
    \ rates. On the other hand, soil moisture sensors measure the water \ncontent\
    \ in the soil, allowing farmers to monitor [27] soil moisture levels and determine\
    \ irrigation needs. These sensors \nhelp prevent overwatering or underwatering,\
    \ optimize water usage, and prevent water stress in crops. However, soil \npH\
    \ sensors measure the acidity or alkalinity of the soil. By monitoring soil pH,\
    \ farmers can determine the soil's nutrient \navailability and adjust soil amendments\
    \ accordingly [28]. Maintaining optimal pH levels is crucial for healthy plant\
    \ \ngrowth and nutrient uptake. As explained in [29], nutrient sensors measure\
    \ the concentration of essential nutrients in \nthe soil, such as nitrogen, phosphorus,\
    \ and potassium. These sensors provide valuable data for precise fertilizer \n\
    application, ensuring that crops receive the right amount of nutrients for optimal\
    \ growth and yield. On the other hand, \ncrop health sensors detect indicators\
    \ of plant stress, diseases, and pests [30]. They can measure parameters such\
    \ as leaf \ntemperature, chlorophyll content, and vegetation indices to assess\
    \ crop health and detect early signs of disease or pest \ninfestation. This data\
    \ helps farmers take timely preventive measures and implement targeted pest management\
    \ \nWorld Journal of Advanced Research and Reviews, 2023, 18(03), 1207–1231 \n\
    1209 \nstrategies. On their part, light sensors measure the intensity and quality\
    \ of light in the crop canopy [31]. They provide \ninformation about photosynthetic\
    \ activity, plant growth stages, and light requirements. This data helps optimize\
    \ \nlighting conditions in controlled environment agriculture (CEA) systems, such\
    \ as greenhouses or vertical farms. On the \nother hand, livestock monitoring\
    \ sensors are used to track parameters related to animal health and well-being\
    \ [32]. For \nexample, temperature sensors [33] can monitor body temperature,\
    \ activity sensors can track animal movement, and \nrumen pH sensors can assess\
    \ digestive health in ruminant animals. Livestock sensors enable early detection\
    \ of health \nissues and support proactive animal management. \n \nFigure 3 Smart\
    \ agriculture \nWater quality sensors measure parameters such as pH, dissolved\
    \ oxygen, conductivity, and turbidity in irrigation water \nsources or aquaculture\
    \ systems [34]. Monitoring water quality ensures that crops or aquatic organisms\
    \ receive clean \nand suitable water, preventing adverse effects on plant health\
    \ or aquatic ecosystems. However, gas sensors detect and \nmeasure the concentration\
    \ of gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2) or ethylene, which are important indicators\
    \ of plant \nrespiration and ripening processes [35]. Gas sensors can be used\
    \ to optimize storage conditions and shelf life of \nharvested crops. On their\
    \ part, insect traps equipped with sensors and lures capture and monitor insect\
    \ populations \n[36]. These sensors help farmers assess pest infestation levels,\
    \ identify specific pest species, and implement targeted \npest management strategies.\
    \ These sensors, among others, provide critical data points that enable farmers\
    \ to monitor \nand manage agricultural systems effectively. Integrating sensor\
    \ data with advanced analytics and decision support \nsystems empowers farmers\
    \ to optimize resource allocation, improve crop yields, and make informed decisions\
    \ for \nsustainable and efficient farming practices. \nIn a nutshell, smart farming\
    \ holds great promise for transforming agriculture into a more sustainable and\
    \ productive \nindustry. By harnessing the power of technology and data, farmers\
    \ can optimize their operations, improve crop yields, \nconserve resources, minimize\
    \ environmental impact, and contribute to global food security in a rapidly evolving\
    \ world.  \nIn this paper, an extensive review of the current status of smart\
    \ agriculture technologies and their security posture is \ngiven. Towards the\
    \ end of this paper, some research gaps are identified which needs to be filled\
    \ by future researches.  \n2. Need for smart agriculture \nSmart agriculture,\
    \ or precision agriculture, is increasingly becoming a necessity due to several\
    \ pressing challenges and \nneeds in the agricultural sector. Table 1 discusses\
    \ some key reasons why smart agriculture is crucial. \n \n \nWorld Journal of\
    \ Advanced Research and Reviews, 2023, 18(03), 1207–1231 \n1210 \nTable 1 Necessity\
    \ of smart agriculture \nNecessity \nDiscussion \nResource Scarcity \nResources\
    \ such as water, land, and energy are limited and face increasing pressure due\
    \ to \npopulation growth and climate change [37]. Smart agriculture enables precise\
    \ resource \nmanagement, minimizing waste and maximizing the efficient [38] use\
    \ of inputs like water, \nfertilizers, and energy. \nCost Optimization \nTraditional\
    \ farming practices often involve overuse or misuse of inputs, leading to higher\
    \ \ncosts [39]. Smart agriculture allows farmers to make data-driven decisions,\
    \ optimizing the \nuse of fertilizers, pesticides, and water, thereby reducing\
    \ costs and increasing profitability \n[40]. \nLabor Efficiency and \nSafety \n\
    Farm labor shortages are a significant challenge in many regions. Smart agriculture\
    \ \nintroduces automation and robotics, reducing the reliance on manual labor\
    \ for tasks such \nas planting, weeding, and harvesting. This not only improves\
    \ efficiency [43] but also \nenhances worker safety by minimizing exposure to\
    \ hazardous conditions. \nClimate Change and \nEnvironmental \nSustainability\
    \ \nClimate change impacts agriculture through extreme weather events, changing\
    \ rainfall \npatterns, and the spread of pests and diseases. Smart agriculture\
    \ helps farmers adapt to \nclimate change by providing real-time data on weather\
    \ conditions, enabling timely \ninterventions, and reducing environmental impact\
    \ through optimized resource usage [44], \n[45]. \nTraceability \nand \nQuality\
    \ Assurance \nConsumers are increasingly concerned about the origin and quality\
    \ of the food they \nconsume [46], [47]. Smart agriculture technologies enable\
    \ improved traceability [48], \nallowing farmers to track the entire supply chain,\
    \ ensure food safety, and provide \ntransparent information to consumers. \nData-Driven\
    \ Decision \nMaking \nSmart agriculture generates vast amounts of data through\
    \ sensors, drones, and satellite \nimagery [49], [50]. Analyzing this data using\
    \ AI and data analytics helps farmers gain \nvaluable insights, make informed\
    \ decisions, and optimize farming practices for better \noutcomes [51]. \nPopulation\
    \ \nGrowth \nand Food Demand \nThe global population is projected to reach 9.7\
    \ billion by 2050, which will significantly \nincrease the demand for food. Smart\
    \ agriculture offers a way to increase agricultural \nproductivity and efficiency\
    \ to meet this growing demand [52]. \nCrop Monitoring and \nManagement \nSmart\
    \ agriculture technologies enable continuous monitoring [53] of crops, including\
    \ \nfactors like soil moisture, temperature, and nutrient levels. This data-driven\
    \ approach helps \nfarmers detect crop stress, diseases, and nutrient deficiencies\
    \ early on, allowing timely \ninterventions and reducing crop losses [54], [55].\
    \ \n \nBasically, the need for smart agriculture arises from the need to address\
    \ challenges such as population growth, resource \nscarcity, climate change, cost\
    \ optimization, and labor efficiency. By integrating advanced technologies, smart\
    \ agriculture \noffers the potential to transform traditional farming practices\
    \ into more sustainable, productive, and environmentally \nfriendly systems. \n\
    2.1. Technologies driving smart agriculture \nSmart agriculture is driven by various\
    \ technologies that enable advanced monitoring, automation, and decision-making\
    \ \nin agricultural practices. These technologies play a crucial role in optimizing\
    \ resource management, improving crop \nyields, and enhancing overall efficiency\
    \ in farming operations. Some of the prominent key driving technologies in smart\
    \ \nagriculture are presented in Fig. 4 and are discussed in the sub-sections\
    \ below. \n2.1.1. Internet of Things (IoT) \nIoT technology forms the backbone\
    \ of smart agriculture by connecting physical devices and sensors to the internet,\
    \ \nenabling data collection and remote monitoring [56]-[58]. IoT devices such\
    \ as weather stations, soil moisture sensors, \nand crop health sensors provide\
    \ real-time data on environmental conditions, plant growth, and livestock health.\
    \ This \ndata enables farmers to make data-driven decisions and optimize resource\
    \ allocation [59]. \nWorld Journal of Advanced Research and Reviews, 2023, 18(03),\
    \ 1207–1231 \n1211 \n \nFigure 4 Key technological drivers for smart agriculture\
    \ \n2.1.2. Remote Sensing and Satellite Imaging \nRemote sensing technologies,\
    \ including satellite imaging and aerial drones, provide valuable insights into\
    \ crop health, \nwater stress, and pest infestation [60]-[62]. These technologies\
    \ capture high-resolution images and multispectral data, \nallowing farmers to\
    \ monitor large agricultural areas and detect anomalies or crop stress indicators.\
    \ Remote sensing \nhelps in early pest detection, disease prevention, and precision\
    \ agriculture practices. \n2.1.3. Big Data Analytics \nThe ability to process\
    \ and analyze large volumes of data is vital in smart agriculture. Big data analytics\
    \ techniques \nextract meaningful insights from various data sources, including\
    \ weather data, soil data, sensor data, and historical crop \nrecords [63]-[67].\
    \ By analyzing this data, farmers can gain valuable insights into crop performance,\
    \ predict yield \noutcomes, optimize irrigation and fertilization, and identify\
    \ trends for better decision-making. \n2.1.4. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and\
    \ Machine Learning (ML) \nAI and ML technologies are instrumental in smart agriculture\
    \ applications. AI-powered algorithms and ML models can \nanalyze vast amounts\
    \ of data and generate predictive models for disease outbreak detection, crop\
    \ yield forecasting, and \npest management [68]-[71]. These technologies enable\
    \ automated decision-making, real-time monitoring, and \nautonomous operations\
    \ in smart agriculture systems. \n2.1.5. Robotics and Automation \nRobotics and\
    \ automation technologies are transforming traditional farming practices [72].\
    \ Autonomous robots and \ndrones equipped with sensors and cameras can perform\
    \ tasks like seeding, spraying, and harvesting with precision and \nefficiency\
    \ [73]-[76]. Robotic systems can also assist in weed detection and removal, reducing\
    \ the need for manual labor \nand minimizing the use of chemical herbicides. \n\
    2.1.6. Precision Agriculture and Variable Rate Technology (VRT) \nPrecision agriculture\
    \ utilizes technology to optimize resource application based on specific field\
    \ conditions [77]. VRT \nsystems analyze data from sensors [78] and mapping tools\
    \ to precisely deliver inputs such as water, fertilizers, and \npesticides. This\
    \ technology ensures that resources are used efficiently, minimizing waste and\
    \ environmental impact \nwhile maximizing crop productivity. \n2.1.7. Cloud Computing\
    \ and Edge Computing \nCloud computing enables the storage, processing, and analysis\
    \ of agricultural data on remote servers, providing \nscalability and accessibility\
    \ [79]-[83]. Edge computing, on the other hand, brings computing capabilities\

    \ at the field level. Both cloud and edge computing \nsupport the seamless integration\
    \ of data from various sources and enable efficient data management and analysis\
    \ in \nsmart agriculture. \n2.1.8. Agricultural Robotics and Sensing \nAdvanced\
    \ robotic systems equipped with sophisticated sensors and actuators have the potential\
    \ to revolutionize \nagricultural practices [84], [85]. These systems can perform\
    \ tasks such as selective harvesting, precision spraying, and \nWorld Journal\
    \ of Advanced Research and Reviews, 2023, 18(03), 1207–1231 \n1212 \nsoil sampling\
    \ with high accuracy and efficiency. Sensing technologies, including hyperspectral\
    \ imaging and \nmultispectral cameras, enable detailed crop analysis and monitoring.\
    \ \nIt is important to note that these  technologies are continuously evolving\
    \ and becoming more sophisticated, enabling \nfarmers to make data-driven decisions,\
    \ optimize resource allocation, and improve overall agricultural productivity.\
    \ As \nthese technologies continue to advance, they hold immense potential to\
    \ address the global challenges of food security, \nsustainable agriculture, and\
    \ environmental conservation. \n3. General challenges in smart agriculture \n\
    Although smart agriculture brings numerous benefits, there are several challenges\
    \ that need to be addressed for its \nwidespread adoption and successful implementation.\
    \ Some of the general challenges in smart agriculture are described \nin the sub-sections\
    \ below. \n3.1.1.  High Initial Investment \nThe upfront costs of implementing\
    \ smart agriculture technologies can be a significant barrier for many farmers,\
    \ \nespecially small-scale and resource-constrained operations. The cost of purchasing\
    \ and installing sensors, IoT devices, \ndrones, robotics, and data management\
    \ systems can be prohibitive [86], [87]. Governments, organizations, and \nstakeholders\
    \ need to provide financial support, incentives, and subsidies to make these technologies\
    \ more accessible. \n3.1.2. Limited Technical Expertise \nSmart agriculture requires\
    \ a certain level of technical expertise in areas such as data analytics, AI,\
    \ and IoT [88]-[91]. \nHowever, many farmers may lack the necessary knowledge\
    \ and skills to effectively implement and utilize these \ntechnologies. Training\
    \ programs, workshops, and educational initiatives are crucial to bridge this\
    \ knowledge gap and \nempower farmers to leverage smart agriculture solutions\
    \ effectively. \n3.1.3. Connectivity and Infrastructure \nSmart agriculture heavily\
    \ relies on reliable and high-speed internet connectivity, especially in rural\
    \ areas [92]. However, \nin some regions, internet infrastructure is inadequate\
    \ or nonexistent. Poor connectivity can hinder real-time data \ncollection, remote\
    \ monitoring [93], and the seamless operation of IoT devices [94], [95]. Governments\
    \ and private \nstakeholders must invest in improving rural connectivity to ensure\
    \ widespread adoption of smart agriculture. \n3.1.4. Data Privacy and Security\
    \ \nSmart agriculture involves the collection, storage, and analysis of vast amounts\
    \ of data, including sensitive information \nabout crops, farms, and farmers [96]-[99].\
    \ Ensuring data privacy and security is paramount to protect farmers' and \nconsumers'\
    \ interests. Strong data encryption, secure cloud storage, and robust cybersecurity\
    \ measures must be \nimplemented to prevent unauthorized access, data breaches,\
    \ and misuse of information. \n3.1.5. Data Interoperability and Integration \n\
    Smart agriculture systems often involve multiple technologies and platforms, which\
    \ may use different data formats and \nprotocols [100]-[104]. Ensuring seamless\
    \ data interoperability and integration across various systems can be \nchallenging.\
    \ Standardization of data formats, open APIs (Application Programming Interfaces),\
    \ and data-sharing \nprotocols are essential for efficient data exchange and collaboration\
    \ between different smart agriculture solutions. \n3.1.6. Adoption and User Acceptance\
    \ \nFarmers may be resistant to change or skeptical about adopting new technologies.\
    \ Lack of awareness, concerns about \ntechnology reliability, and the perceived\
    \ complexity of smart agriculture solutions can hinder adoption rates [105]-\n\
    [109]. Demonstrating the tangible benefits, providing training and support, and\
    \ showcasing successful case studies are \ncrucial to building trust and encouraging\
    \ widespread adoption. \n3.1.7. Data Management and Analysis \nSmart agriculture\
    \ generates large volumes of data, and effectively managing, analyzing, and interpreting\
    \ this data can \nbe overwhelming [110]-[114]. Farmers need user-friendly data\
    \ management tools and analytics platforms that can \nprocess and present data\
    \ in a meaningful way, providing actionable insights. Simplified data visualization,\
    \ user-friendly \ninterfaces, and user training can help farmers effectively utilize\
    \ the data generated. \nWorld Journal of Advanced Research and Reviews, 2023,\
    \ 18(03), 1207–1231 \n1213 \n3.1.8. Regulatory and Policy Frameworks \nAs smart\
    \ agriculture involves the use of new technologies, regulatory frameworks need\
    \ to keep pace with these \nadvancements. Issues related to data ownership, data\
    \ sharing, privacy regulations, and standardization should be \naddressed through\
    \ appropriate policies [115]-[117]. Governments need to establish clear guidelines\
    \ and regulations to \nensure ethical and responsible use of smart agriculture\
    \ technologies. \nBy addressing these challenges, stakeholders can promote the\
    \ adoption of smart agriculture and leverage its potential \nto revolutionize\
    \ the agricultural sector, improve productivity, and achieve sustainable and efficient\
    \ food production. \n3.2. Security issues in smart agriculture \nSmart agriculture,\
    \ like any other technological system, is susceptible to various security issues\
    \ that need to be addressed \nto ensure the integrity, confidentiality, and availability\
    \ of data and operations [118], [119]. Fig. 5 shows the various \nlayers of the\
    \ smart agriculture environment. \n \nFigure 5 Smart agriculture environment layers\
    \ \nAccording to [120], some of these security issues specific to smart agriculture\
    \ include unauthorized access, data privacy \nand confidentiality, data integrity,\
    \ network security, device security, physical security, supply chain security,\
    \ as well as \nawareness and training. Fig. 6 shows the layered depiction of these\
    \ smart agriculture security challenges. Unauthorized \nindividuals gaining access\
    \ to smart agriculture systems can disrupt operations, manipulate data, or even\
    \ cause physical \ndamage [122]-[123]. It is crucial to implement strong access\
    \ controls, such as secure authentication mechanisms, to \nprevent unauthorized\
    \ access to devices, networks, and data [124]. On the other hand, authors in [125]\
    \ explain that \nsmart agriculture involves the collection and storage of sensitive\
    \ data, including farm management information, crop \nyields, and farmer details.\
    \ Ensuring data privacy and confidentiality is essential to protect farmers' and\
    \ consumers' \ninterests. Robust encryption techniques, secure storage, and proper\
    \ data access controls should be implemented to \nsafeguard sensitive information\
    \ [126]-[129]. In addition, maintaining the integrity of data is crucial in smart\
    \ agriculture \nsystems. This is because any unauthorized modification, tampering,\
    \ or corruption of data can lead to incorrect decisions \nand impact the overall\
    \ farming operations. Implementing data validation mechanisms, digital signatures,\
    \ and secure \ncommunication channels can help ensure data integrity [130]-[134].\
    \ As explained in [135], smart agriculture systems \nrely on networks and communication\
    \ channels for data transmission. These networks are vulnerable to various threats\
    \ \nWorld Journal of Advanced Research and Reviews, 2023, 18(03), 1207–1231 \n\
    1214 \nsuch as eavesdropping, data interception, and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks\
    \ [136]-[139]. Implementing secure \nnetwork protocols, firewalls, intrusion detection\
    \ systems, and regular network monitoring are essential to protect \nagainst network-based\
    \ attacks. \n \nFigure 6 Layered security challenges in smart agriculture \nIoT\
    \ devices, sensors, and actuators play a significant role in smart agriculture\
    \ [140]-[144]. However, these devices can \nbe potential entry points for attackers.\
    \ Ensuring the security of these devices through measures like strong \nauthentication,\
    \ regular firmware updates, and secure configurations is crucial to prevent unauthorized\
    \ access and \ncompromise of the entire system. Researchers in [145] discuss that\
    \ smart agriculture systems may include physical \ninfrastructure like weather\
    \ stations, drones, and robots. Securing these physical assets from theft, vandalism,\
    \ or \nphysical tampering is vital. Implementing access controls, surveillance\
    \ systems, and physical barriers can help protect \nthe physical components of\
    \ smart agriculture. On their part, the authors in [146] argue that smart agriculture\
    \ systems \nrely on various vendors and suppliers for hardware, software, and\
    \ services. Ensuring the security of the entire supply \nchain is crucial to prevent\
    \ the introduction of compromised or malicious components [147], [148]. Conducting\
    \ thorough \nvendor assessments, implementing secure development practices, and\
    \ performing regular security audits are important \nfor maintaining a secure\
    \ supply chain. In addition, human error and lack of awareness can contribute\
    \ to security \nvulnerabilities [149]. Farmers and operators should receive proper\
    \ training and awareness programs to understand \nsecurity best practices, identify\
    \ potential threats, and respond to security incidents promptly. \nAddressing\
    \ these security issues requires a multi-layered approach that combines technical\
    \ controls, policies, training, \nand regular security assessments. Collaboration\
    \ between farmers, technology providers, and cybersecurity experts is \ncrucial\
    \ to identify and mitigate security risks, ensuring the safe and secure implementation\
    \ of smart agriculture systems. \n4. Ways of securing smart agriculture \nSecuring\
    \ smart agriculture systems involves implementing various techniques and best\
    \ practices to protect data, \ndevices, and infrastructure. Table 2 describes\
    \ some techniques for securing smart agriculture. \nTable 2 Techniques for securing\
    \ smart agriculture \nTechnique \nDescription \nStrong Authentication \nand Access\
    \ Controls \nImplement robust authentication mechanisms, such as multi-factor\
    \ authentication, to \nensure that only authorized individuals can access the\
    \ smart agriculture system [150]-\n[154]. Additionally, enforce strict access\
    \ controls to limit privileges and restrict access to \nsensitive data and critical\
    \ functionalities. \nRegular Patching and \nUpdates \nKeep all software, firmware,\
    \ and operating systems up to date with the latest security \npatches [155]-[158].\
    \ Regularly update IoT devices, sensors, and other components to \naddress any\
    \ known vulnerabilities [159] and ensure that they are running on the most \n\
    secure versions. \nWorld Journal of Advanced Research and Reviews, 2023, 18(03),\
    \ 1207–1231 \n1215 \nNetwork Segmentation \nSegment the smart agriculture network\
    \ into different zones or subnets to separate critical \ncomponents, such as IoT\
    \ devices, sensors, and data storage systems [160]-[163]. This helps \ncontain\
    \ security breaches and limits unauthorized access to sensitive areas of the network.\
    \ \nSecure Communication \nChannels \n \nUse secure protocols and encryption techniques\
    \ (e.g., SSL/TLS) to ensure the \nconfidentiality and integrity of data transmitted\
    \ between devices, sensors, and the central \nsystem [164]-[168]. Secure communication\
    \ channels prevent eavesdropping, data \ninterception, and tampering during data\
    \ transmission. \nPhysical \nSecurity \nMeasures \nSecure physical components\
    \ of smart agriculture systems, including weather stations, \ndrones, and robots,\
    \ to prevent theft, tampering, or unauthorized access [169]. Implement \nphysical\
    \ barriers, surveillance systems, and access controls to protect physical assets\
    \ \n[170]-[173]. \nEmployee Training and \nAwareness \nProvide comprehensive training\
    \ programs to farmers, operators, and other stakeholders \nto raise awareness\
    \ about security best practices, social engineering threats, and safe \nhandling\
    \ of data and devices. Educate users about potential risks and how to identify\
    \ and \nreport security incidents [174]. \nSecurity \nMonitoring \nand Incident\
    \ Response \nImplement robust monitoring tools and techniques to continuously\
    \ monitor the smart \nagriculture system for potential security incidents [175].\
    \ Establish an incident response \nplan to handle security breaches, including\
    \ procedures for investigation, containment, \neradication, and recovery [176]-[178].\
    \ \nIntrusion \nDetection \nand \nPrevention \nSystems \nDeploy intrusion detection\
    \ and prevention systems (IDPS) to monitor network traffic, \ndetect suspicious\
    \ activities, and prevent potential attacks [179], [180]. IDPS can identify \n\
    and respond to malicious behavior, such as unauthorized access [181] attempts\
    \ or \nabnormal data patterns. \nData Encryption and \nPrivacy \n \nImplement\
    \ strong encryption algorithms to protect sensitive data both at rest and in \n\
    transit. Encrypt data stored on devices, databases, and cloud storage to prevent\
    \ \nunauthorized access [182]-[186]. Also, ensure compliance with privacy regulations\
    \ and \nestablish clear policies on data handling and sharing. \nRegular \nSecurity\
    \ \nAssessments \nConduct regular security assessments, penetration testing, and\
    \ vulnerability scanning to \nidentify and address any potential weaknesses in\
    \ the smart agriculture system [187]-[191]. \nRegular assessments help ensure\
    \ that security measures are up to date and effective in \nprotecting against\
    \ emerging threats. \n \nBy implementing these techniques, smart agriculture systems\
    \ can significantly enhance their security posture and \nprotect against potential\
    \ threats, ensuring the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of data and\
    \ operations. \n5. Issues with current smart agriculture protection techniques\
    \ \nThere are several protection techniques available for securing smart agriculture\
    \ systems. However, there are still some \nissues and challenges associated with\
    \ their implementation. The following sub-sections discuss some common issues\
    \ \nwith current smart agriculture protection techniques. \n5.1 Lack of Standardization\
    \ \nThe smart agriculture industry lacks standardized security protocols and frameworks,\
    \ making it challenging to ensure \nconsistent and interoperable security measures\
    \ across different systems and devices [192], [193]. The absence of \nwidely accepted\
    \ standards hinders seamless integration and can lead to compatibility issues\
    \ when implementing \nsecurity solutions. \n5.2 Limited Security Awareness and\
    \ Expertise \nMany farmers and agricultural professionals may have limited knowledge\
    \ and awareness of cybersecurity risks and \nbest practices. The lack of security\
    \ expertise among end-users can result in improper implementation of security\
    \ \nmeasures, such as weak passwords, misconfigurations, or failure to update\
    \ software/firmware promptly [194], [195]. \nWorld Journal of Advanced Research\
    \ and Reviews, 2023, 18(03), 1207–1231 \n1216 \n5.3 Vulnerabilities in IoT Devices\
    \ \nIoT devices used in smart agriculture systems may have inherent security vulnerabilities\
    \ [196]. These vulnerabilities \ncan be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized\
    \ access, manipulate data, or disrupt operations [196]-[199]. The rapid \nproliferation\
    \ of IoT devices and their diverse manufacturers make it challenging to ensure\
    \ consistent security standards \nacross all devices. \n5.4 Complexity and Cost\
    \ \nImplementing comprehensive security measures can be complex and expensive\
    \ for farmers, particularly small-scale \noperations with limited budgets. The\
    \ costs associated with purchasing, deploying, and maintaining security solutions\
    \ \ncan be prohibitive, deterring widespread adoption of robust security measures\
    \ [200], [201]. \n5.5 Legacy Systems and Infrastructure \nMany agricultural systems\
    \ still rely on legacy equipment and infrastructure that may not have built-in\
    \ security features \nor support modern security protocols [202], [203]. Integrating\
    \ security solutions with existing legacy systems can be \nchallenging and may\
    \ require additional investments in upgrading or replacing outdated components\
    \ [204]. \n5.6 Lack of Security Updates and Support \nSome smart agriculture solutions\
    \ may lack regular security updates and ongoing support from vendors [205]-[207].\
    \ \nThis can leave systems vulnerable to emerging threats, as security patches\
    \ and updates are essential for addressing \nnewly discovered vulnerabilities\
    \ and ensuring the long-term security of the system. \n5.7 Physical Security Risks\
    \ \nWhile digital security is crucial, physical security risks in smart agriculture\
    \ systems cannot be overlooked [209], [210]. \nComponents such as sensors, drones,\
    \ or weather stations are vulnerable to physical tampering, theft, or damage.\
    \ \nEnsuring adequate physical security measures, such as access controls and\
    \ surveillance, is essential but can be \nchallenging in remote or expansive farming\
    \ environments. \n5.8 Integration and Compatibility Challenges \nSmart agriculture\
    \ systems often involve the integration of various technologies, platforms, and\
    \ third-party solutions. \nEnsuring seamless integration and compatibility between\
    \ different components can be complex, as they may have \ndifferent security requirements,\
    \ protocols, or interfaces [211]-[214]. Incompatibility issues can create security\
    \ gaps and \nincrease the risk of vulnerabilities. \nAddressing these issues requires\
    \ collaborative efforts between technology providers, agricultural stakeholders,\
    \ and \npolicymakers. It involves promoting security standards and best practices,\
    \ providing security training and awareness \nprograms, encouraging security-by-design\
    \ principles in IoT device manufacturing, and fostering partnerships to \ndevelop\
    \ cost-effective security solutions tailored for the agricultural sector [215]-[219].\
    \ \n6. Future research scope \nBased on the shortcomings of the current smart\
    \ agriculture defense mechanisms, future research can explore several \nareas\
    \ to enhance the protection of agricultural systems and address emerging challenges.\
    \ Some potential research \nscopes include the following: \n6.1 Threat Modeling\

    \ \nprivacy, and responsible use of technology in agriculture. \nThese research\
    \ scopes aim to advance the field of smart agriculture security, addressing the\
    \ evolving security challenges \nand developing innovative solutions to protect\
    \ agricultural systems, data, and stakeholders. \n7 Conclusion \nSecurity issues\
    \ in smart agriculture pose significant challenges that need to be addressed to\
    \ ensure the integrity, \nconfidentiality, and availability of data and operations.\
    \ The protection of smart agriculture systems is crucial to prevent \nunauthorized\
    \ access, data breaches, tampering, and disruption of farming operations. This\
    \ paper has highlighted several \nfactors that contribute to the complexity and\

    \ \nprotocols and frameworks, limited security awareness and expertise among farmers,\
    \ and vulnerabilities in IoT devices \nhave been shown to be major concerns. Additionally,\
    \ the complexity and cost associated with implementing \ncomprehensive security\
    \ measures, legacy systems and infrastructure, and the need for regular security\
    \ updates and \nsupport pose additional challenges. Physical security risks and\
    \ integration and compatibility issues further compound \nthe security landscape\
    \ of smart agriculture. To overcome these challenges, future research and development\
    \ efforts \nshould focus on threat modeling, risk assessment, blockchain technology,\
    \ secure data analytics, intrusion detection \nsystems, machine learning for anomaly\
    \ detection, security-aware IoT device design, secure communication protocols,\
    \ \nSIEM for agriculture, privacy and data protection, security-aware farm management\
    \ systems, and social and ethical \nconsiderations. It has been shown that addressing\
    \ security issues in smart agriculture requires collaborative efforts \nbetween\
    \ technology providers, agricultural stakeholders, researchers, and policymakers.\
    \ It is crucial to develop and \nimplement robust security measures, promote security\
    \ standards and best practices, provide security training and \nawareness programs,\
    \ and foster partnerships to develop cost-effective security solutions tailored\
    \ for the agricultural \nsector. By addressing these security issues comprehensively,\
    \ we can ensure the trustworthiness, resilience, and \nsustainability of smart\
    \ agriculture systems, thereby unlocking their full potential to revolutionize\
    \ the agricultural \nindustry, improve productivity, and contribute to global\
    \ food security. \nCompliance with ethical standards \nAcknowledgments \nAll the\

  explanation: 'The provided study analyzed the cybersecurity relevance of 62 European
    research projects funded under the Horizon 2020 Program and focused on smart cities.
    Thematic analysis was used to identify dimensions and sub-dimensions of security
    risks and mitigation proposals. Seven dimensions of security risks emerged: infrastructure
    vulnerabilities, data privacy, network vulnerabilities, access control, IoT devices,
    security standards and regulation, and human behavior. Each dimension was further
    divided into sub-dimensions, resulting in a total of 31 sub-dimensions. The study
    also identified 24 mitigation strategies proposed by the research projects to
    address these security risks.'

    \ complex and interconnected infrastructure of smart cities offers several opportunities\n\
    for attackers to exploit vulnerabilities and carry out cyberattacks that can have\
    \ serious consequences\nfor the functioning of cities’ critical infrastructures.\
    \ This study aims to address this phenomenon\nand characterize the dimensions\
    \ of security risks in smart cities and present mitigation proposals\nto address\
    \ these risks. The study adopts a qualitative methodology through the identiﬁcation\
    \ of\n62 European research projects in the ﬁeld of cybersecurity in smart cities,\
    \ which are underway during\nthe period from 2022 to 2027. Compared to previous\
    \ studies, this work provides a comprehensive\nview of security risks from the\
    \ perspective of multiple universities, research centers, and companies\nparticipating\
    \ in European projects. The ﬁndings of this study offer relevant scientiﬁc contributions\
    \ by\nidentifying 7 dimensions and 31 sub-dimensions of cybersecurity risks in\
    \ smart cities and proposing\n24 mitigation strategies to face these security\
    \ challenges. Furthermore, this study explores emerg-\ning cybersecurity issues\
    \ to which smart cities are exposed by the increasing proliferation of new\ntechnologies\
    \ and standards.\nKeywords: cybersecurity; smart cities; intelligent devices;\
    \ cyber-attacks; privacy\n1. Introduction\nSmart cities are urban spaces characterized\
    \ by the widespread use of Information and\nCommunication Technologies (ICTs).\
    \ They intend to improve political-economic efﬁciency\nand support human and social\
    \ development, thus improving the quality of life of its citizens.\nAccording\
    \ to Toli and Murtagh [1], a city is considered “smart” when there are drivers\n\
    of sustainable eco-economic growth, a high quality of life, and conscious management\
    \ of\nnatural resources through participatory and democratic governance. Several\
    \ drivers of\nsmart cities include investments in technological infrastructure,\
    \ investments in human\ncapital, and social investments. In addition, other aspects\
    \ that should be considered when\nclassifying cities as smart include urban mobility,\
    \ commitment to environmental issues, and\nsocial issues [2–5]. In summary, smart\
    \ cities use technology and innovation to improve the\nquality of life of their\
    \ inhabitants, increase the economic value generated in that community,\nand promote\
    \ environmental sustainability.\nSmart cities focus on the provision of a set\
    \ of initiatives, actions, and services, in\nvarious areas of applicability in\
    \ cities that aim to optimize and improve the well-being of\ntheir populations,\
    \ both in terms of health and the environment. In broad terms, the goal\nof smart\
    \ cities is to dynamically optimize the city to provide a set of actions and services\n\
    for a more inclusive and sustainable city [6,7]. The main role that ICTs can assume\
    \ is to\nintegrate information systems services from each domain of activity of\
    \ a city, such as health,\neducation, transportation, energy, water, and waste\
    \ management, to provide public services\nto citizens in a more efﬁcient and ubiquitous\
    \ way [8]. Furthermore, ICT plays a role in\nthe incorporation and integration\
    \ of various complex systems at the level of technological\ninfrastructure, social\
    \ structures, politics, and human behavior [9,10].\nAt the same time, the role\
    \ of ICT for businesses, citizens, and civil society to create,\ninvent, and experiment\
    \ new things to improve and optimize the quality of life in cities is\nalso widely\
    \ known and accepted. However, taking into account the exposure of digital\nFuture\
    \ Internet 2023, 15, 285. https://doi.org/10.3390/ﬁ15090285\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/futureinternet\n\
    Future Internet 2023, 15, 285\n2 of 21\nservices and support services of the various\
    \ domains through communication networks\nand the use of ICT, it is important\
    \ to consider the identiﬁcation of risks and challenges\nassociated with smart\
    \ cities, to reduce or mitigate these risks, namely in different sectors of\n\
    activity, such as industrial control systems, intelligent transportation systems,\
    \ Internet of\nThings (IoT), and digital health (e-health), in addition to other\
    \ areas of intervention of cities.\nThe literature [11,12] recognizes that cybersecurity\
    \ and data privacy issues have become\nincreasingly relevant, questionable, and\
    \ challenging, both for citizens and for technology\ncompanies that provide digital\
    \ services who are aware of the problem of cybercrime\nand cyberterrorism.\nCybersecurity\
    \ plays a key role in smart cities due to the increasing interconnectivity\nand\
    \ widespread use of ICT [13]. In smart cities, systems and devices are networked\
    \ to\ncollect data, monitor infrastructures, optimize services, and improve citizens’\
    \ quality of\nlife. However, this connectivity exposes cities to a range of cyber\
    \ threats, making data and\ninfrastructure security critical. Systematic literature\
    \ reviews performed by Kim et al. [14]\nand Gracias et al. [15] in the ﬁeld of\
    \ smart cities have identiﬁed cybersecurity as a key\nfactor for the implementation\
    \ of a smart city. Furthermore, studies in the area have sought\nto characterize\
    \ the various security risks considering theoretical models for identifying\n\
    vulnerabilities [16–20] and empirical scenarios considering several smart cities\
    \ such as\nDubai, Barcelona, Shanghai, and Como [21–24]. The main research gap\
    \ is the difﬁculty of an\nintegrative overview of the main security risks considering\
    \ a multidisciplinary perspective\nthat can complement the vision of scientiﬁc\
    \ and industrial partners. Combining scientiﬁc\nand industrial partners in the\
    \ development of smart cities is of paramount importance\nconsidering that smart\
    \ city challenges are complex and multifaceted [25,26]. Therefore,\nscientiﬁc\
    \ partners can provide in-depth insights into these challenges, while industrial\n\
    partners can contribute their practical experience and knowledge of market dynamics.\n\
    By combining these perspectives, smart city projects can be designed and executed\
    \ in\na more holistic and comprehensive manner. In view of this, this study seeks\
    \ to use a\ncomprehensive perspective that results from the analysis of the role\
    \ of cybersecurity in\nsmart cities considering several projects, in which several\
    \ European universities, research\ncenters, and companies participate. The data\
    \ are extracted from the EU-funded projects\ndatabase made available by the CORDIS\
    \ portal. Three research questions (RQs) are posed:\nRQ1 intends to characterize\
    \ the dimensions of security risks that can be found in smart\ncities; then, RQ2\
    \ aims to identify measures proposed under these projects to mitigate\npreviously\
    \ identiﬁed security risks; ﬁnally, RQ3 seeks to explore emerging security risks\n\
    that may arise in the face of recent technological and social developments.\n\
    This study is organized into the following sections: In the ﬁrst phase, a theoretical\n\
    review is made on the topics of information security and security risks in smart\
    \ cities. After\nthat, the methodological approach and methods applied in the\
    \ development of the study\nare presented. This is followed by the presentation\
    \ and discussion of the results given the\nresearch questions previously formulated.\
    \ Finally, the main conclusions of the study are\nlisted. This last section also\
    \ sets out the limitations of the study and provides suggestions\nfor future work.\n\
    2. Literature Review\n2.1. Information Security\nIn recent years, the potential\
    \ and actual impacts of security threats in cyberspace\nhave become evident due\
    \ to several incidents with direct repercussions on the security of\ncountries\
    \ and citizens [27–29]. Digital technologies and cyberspace are not only resources\n\
    and space where one can do better and more efﬁciently what was once difﬁcult,\
    \ time-\nconsuming, and costly to do. As argued by Lippert and Cloutier [30],\
    \ this new reality has\ncreated the potential to signiﬁcantly alter the inﬂuence\
    \ of different groups or actors in the\ninternational and national, social, or\
    \ business scenes.\nInformation systems, digital communication, and the surrounding\
    \ digital environment\nare key elements for successful decision-making processes\
    \ that aim to produce informed\nFuture Internet 2023, 15, 285\n3 of 21\ndecisions\
    \ on critical and sensitive issues. Today, we are able to create, update and store\n\
    more information than we have ever been able to in the past, but never has that\
    \ information\nbeen as threatened as it is today. To maintain sustainable and\
    \ competitive infrastructures,\nwhich are vital to the survival of nations around\
    \ the world, there has been a drive to invest\nin mechanisms and processes that\
    \ derive from the need to make every possible effort to\nensure secure digital\
    \ resources. Authors such as Knell [31] and Pereira et al. [32] emphasize\nthat\
    \ the world is highly interconnected, with resources interconnected with structures\n\
    and networks on a global scale. Therefore, one of the main concerns to ensure\
    \ a secure\nprotection and safeguarding of information has been the security of\
    \ information systems,\npublic and private, and their information, which is essential\
    \ to support the activities\nof organizations. It also emerges that information\
    \ security is also vital to building and\nmaintaining customer trust. Consumers\
    \ are increasingly concerned about the privacy and\nprotection of their personal\
    \ data. Bleier et al. [33] argue that by demonstrating a serious\ncommitment to\
    \ information security, organizations can gain customer trust and establish\n\
    lasting relationships. This is also an important element in the context of smart\
    \ city adoption,\nas recognized in this study, in which the relationships established\
    \ also manifest themselves\nin the inclusion of new services in smart cities.\n\
    Information security addresses multiple domains. Broadly we can look at information\n\
    security as the protection of data and information of individuals, organizations,\
    \ and\ngovernments from unauthorized access, misuse, disclosure, alteration, or\
    \ destruction [34].\nThe importance of information security can be understood\
    \ in different aspects. Information\nsecurity must ensure the conﬁdentiality of\
    \ data, preventing sensitive information from\nfalling into the wrong hands. This\
    \ is especially critical when it comes to personal data,\nﬁnancial information,\
    \ trade secrets, or government information. Based in a literature review,\nRath\
    \ and Kumar [35] have concluded that a breach of conﬁdentiality can lead to serious\n\
    consequences such as identity theft, ﬁnancial loss, or reputational damage. Information\n\
    security also aims to ensure data integrity (i.e., its accuracy, completeness,\
    \ and consistency\nover time). It is essential that information is not altered\
    \ in an unauthorized or accidental\nway, ensuring that it remains reliable and\
    \ accurate. A lack of data integrity can lead to\nwrong decisions, errors in processes,\
    \ and loss of conﬁdence in the information [36]. Finally,\ninformation security\
    \ must ensure that data and systems are available when needed. This\nimplies protecting\
    \ information against technical failures, cyber-attacks, or natural disasters\n\
    that may compromise data availability. In their work exploring the relationship\
    \ between\navailability and other security issues, Qadir and Quadri [37] have\
    \ realized that a lack of\navailability can cause business disruptions, lost productivity,\
    \ and ﬁnancial losses. In the\ncontext of smart cities, this study also conﬁrms\
    \ that a lack of availability can have profound\nand far-reaching impacts on various\
    \ aspects of urban life. Smart cities rely on a network of\ninterconnected devices,\
    \ sensors, and systems to deliver critical services and real-time data.\nService\
    \ disruptions can lead to inconvenience for citizens, economic losses for businesses,\n\
    and even public safety concerns.\nInformation security, data science, and technology\
    \ are interconnected domains. Data\nscience involves the extraction of knowledge\
    \ and insights from data. It encompasses a\nwide range of techniques, including\
    \ data collection, data cleaning, data analysis, data\nvisualization, machine\
    \ learning, and statistical modeling [38,39]. Technology serves as the\nfoundation\
    \ for both information security and data science. Technological advancements\n\
    have enabled the rapid growth of digital data and the development of sophisticated\
    \ tools\nand algorithms to process and analyze it. Key technological components\
    \ that support\ninformation security and data science include big data platforms,\
    \ cloud computing, artiﬁcial\nintelligence, machine learning, cryptography, and\
    \ networking and communication. Hazim\nand Khan [40] provide several examples\
    \ of the use of the cloud in organizations and pointed\nout that cloud services\
    \ have revolutionized data storage, accessibility, and processing.\nThey provide\
    \ scalable infrastructure to accommodate large datasets and host data science\n\
    applications and security solutions. Cloud service providers maintain vast data\
    \ centers\nwith a wide array of servers, storage, and networking resources. They\
    \ can allocate and\nFuture Internet 2023, 15, 285\n4 of 21\nreallocate these resources\
    \ dynamically based on demand. According to Brataas et al. [41],\nthis allows\
    \ users to scale up (add more resources) or scale down (remove excess resources)\n\
    as needed, without having to invest in physical hardware themselves. Furthermore,\
    \ cloud\nplatforms offer elasticity, which means they can automatically adjust\
    \ resources in response\nto varying workloads. During periods of high demand,\
    \ the cloud can rapidly provision\nadditional resources, and during low-demand\
    \ periods, it can release unneeded resources.\nBiswas et al. [42] state that dynamic\
    \ scaling ensures efﬁcient resource utilization and cost-\neffectiveness. Cloud\
    \ computing and machine learning are two powerful technologies\nthat can be effectively\
    \ combined to leverage their respective strengths. The integration\nof machine\
    \ learning with cloud computing enables scalable and ﬂexible solutions for\nprocessing\
    \ and analyzing large datasets, building sophisticated models, and deploying AI-\n\
    powered applications [43]. Machine learning tasks often require signiﬁcant computational\n\
    resources, especially for training complex models. Peng et al. [44] provide a\
    \ vision regarding\nthe parallel computing programming mode in the context of\
    \ cloud computing and argue\nthat it has enabled distributed computing, which\
    \ can signiﬁcantly speed up the training\nprocess by distributing the workload\
    \ across multiple servers or nodes. This parallel\nprocessing capability can be\
    \ relevant when training complex models on large datasets.\n2.2. Security Risks\
    \ in Smart Cities\nICT plays a key role in the development of smart cities, which\
    \ combine infrastructure,\narchitecture, objects, and people to improve processes\
    \ and address social, economic, and\nenvironmental problems. Several technologies\
    \ such as cloud, big data, artiﬁcial intelligence,\nblockchain, and IoT are found\
    \ in smart cities. Nastjuk et al. [45] advocate that the use of\nemerging technologies\
    \ is an enabler of innovation in the context of smart cities, and that it\nis\
    \ not limited to the technological perspective of cities, but enables the creation\
    \ of a smart\nenvironment, smart governance, and smart economy. Given the above,\
    \ it can be inferred\nthat there is no smart city without technology and innovation,\
    \ as these are the factors that\ndifferentiate it from an ordinary city [46].\
    \ Necessarily, the adoption of new technologies\nand the high interconnectivity\
    \ between them and humans makes smart cities vulnerable to\nvarious cyber threats\
    \ [47,48]. Therefore, protecting the infrastructure, systems, and data\nfrom malicious\
    \ activities is essential to ensure the security, privacy, and reliability of\
    \ smart\ncity services. Accordingly, there is a need to explore and know mitigation\
    \ strategies that\ncan address these challenges.\nIt is important to highlight\
    \ that the security and privacy challenges of smart cities are\nnot new and that\
    \ many of them already exist in the isolated use of each of their technologies,\n\
    but that they now assume a greater impact in the interconnected context of smart\
    \ cities.\nThe infrastructure of a smart city is composed of thousands of devices\
    \ and applications\nthat aim to improve processes and bring beneﬁts to citizens.\
    \ However, the use of these\napplications and systems can bring several problems\
    \ related to security and privacy. Elliott\nand Soifer [49] and Federspiel et\
    \ al. [50] refer to the vulnerabilities that occur by adopting\nsmart systems\
    \ based on artiﬁcial intelligence, as they not only collect a wide variety of\n\
    sensitive information from people and their social circles, but also control city\
    \ facilities\nand inﬂuence citizens’ lives. The empirical work carried out also\
    \ shows that the European\nprojects included in this study consider the challenges\
    \ inherent in big data, data analytics,\nartiﬁcial intelligence, and machine learning.\n\
    Security is seen as a dynamic concept, not a stagnant one, in which we seek to\
    \ prevent\nharm by digital and physical means, both direct and indirect [51].\
    \ In a smart city, security\nis looked at in the general component by covering\
    \ all the features of the city, but it is\nalso included in all the aspects that\
    \ make it up. Studies by Ghazizadeh et al. [52] use an\nextended version of the\
    \ Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to demonstrate that security\nis a key factor\
    \ in technology acceptance. Thus, safety encompasses more than just technical\n\
    factors, having a strong human-dependent aspect, also including subjective factors\
    \ related\nto the perception of individuals [53]. Consequently, the existence\
    \ of objective and subjective\nFuture Internet 2023, 15, 285\n5 of 21\ndimensions\
    \ of security is assumed. The role of human behavior is also widely highlighted\n\
    in this study as a dimension is identiﬁed.\nCybersecurity plays a key role in\
    \ protecting critical infrastructure, which includes\nsystems and assets that\
    \ are essential to the functioning of society and the economy. This\ninfrastructure\
    \ can include power grids, transportation networks, water treatment facilities,\n\
    communication systems, and more. Protecting these vital components from cyber\
    \ threats\nis critical to prevent the disruptions, unauthorized access, or sabotage\
    \ that can affect\ncitywide operations [54]. The privacy by design approach advocated\
    \ in studies such\nas Drev and Delak’s [55] and Romanou’s [56] is essential in\
    \ smart cities that must be\nsupported by a secure architecture and design. Therefore,\
    \ cybersecurity considerations\nshould be integrated into the architecture and\
    \ design of critical infrastructure systems from\nthe outset. This involves following\
    \ the best security practices, conducting risk assessments,\nand implementing\
    \ appropriate security controls [57,58].\nProtecting data privacy is another area\
    \ of concern in smart cities’ environments. Smart\ncities generate massive amounts\
    \ of data from sensors, surveillance systems, and connected\ndevices. These data\
    \ often contain sensitive information about individuals, including their\nlocations,\
    \ behaviors, and personal preferences. Data encryption is a fundamental technique\n\
    used to secure data in transit and at rest. In smart cities, sensitive data such\
    \ as personal\ninformation, ﬁnancial records, and surveillance footage should\
    \ be encrypted to prevent\nunauthorized access or interception by malicious actors\
    \ [59]. The importance of data\nminimization and anonymization is associated with\
    \ the appearance of data encryption.\nDaoudagh et al. [60] recommend that smart\
    \ cities should practice data minimization, col-\nlecting only the necessary data\
    \ to fulﬁll their functions and reducing the risk associated\nwith storing excessive\
    \ personal information. Furthermore, smart cities must implement\nrobust access\
    \ controls to restrict access to sensitive systems and data. This involves im-\n\
    plementing secure authentication mechanisms such as multi-factor authentication\
    \ and\nrole-based access control (RBAC) to ensure that only authorized individuals\
    \ can access\nspeciﬁc data [61]. Additionally, smart cities must incorporate secure\
    \ communication mech-\nanisms. Communication between devices and systems within\
    \ a smart city’s infrastructure\nshould be secured to prevent eavesdropping or\
    \ tampering. In the review work carried out\nby Rahouti et al. [62] it is highlighted\
    \ that the adoption of secure protocols like Transport\nLayer Security (TLS) and\
    \ Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) can ensure encrypted and au-\nthenticated communication\
    \ channels. These proposals are relevant to the approach of our\nstudy, which\
    \ identiﬁes cybersecurity challenges related to network vulnerabilities related\n\
    to unauthorized access and interception of communications.\nIoT devices are the\
    \ backbone of smart cities, enabling connectivity and data exchange\namong various\
    \ systems and devices. However, these devices are often vulnerable to cyber-\n\
    attacks due to their limited security measures [63]. Consequently, robust cybersecurity\n\
    practices are needed to secure IoT devices, including implementing secure authentica-\n\
    tion, encryption, and regular software updates to prevent unauthorized access\
    \ or control.\nSeveral approaches are proposed in the literature to increase the\
    \ security of IoT devices.\nImplementing robust authentication mechanisms such\
    \ as multi-factor authentication (MFA)\nis proposed by Ometov et al. [64] to ensure\
    \ that only authorized users or devices can access\nthe IoT devices. This helps\
    \ prevent unauthorized access and protects against brute-force\nattacks. The adoption\
    \ of secure communication protocols such as Transport Layer Secu-\nrity (TLS)\
    \ or Secure Shell (SSH) to encrypt data transmitted between IoT devices and the\n\
    backend systems is proposed by Paul et al. [65]. This prevents the eavesdropping\
    \ of and\ntampering with sensitive information. Regular ﬁrmware updates are recommended\
    \ by\nGong et al. [66] to keep the ﬁrmware of IoT devices up to date by applying\
    \ regular security\npatches and updates provided by the manufacturers. This helps\
    \ address vulnerabilities and\nensures that devices are protected against known\
    \ security risks. Finally, Prazeres et al. [67]\nemploy an approach using test\
    \ data from different datasets to suggest the implementation\nof network segmentation\
    \ to isolate IoT devices from other critical infrastructure systems.\nThis way,\
    \ even if one device is compromised, it will not provide direct access to the\
    \ entire\nFuture Internet 2023, 15, 285\n6 of 21\nnetwork, reducing the potential\
    \ impact of an attack. Our study conﬁrms that IoT security\nplays a critical role\
    \ in safeguarding not only the devices and systems connected to the\ninternet,\
    \ but also the entire digital infrastructure and data ecosystem.\nEffective cybersecurity\
    \ in smart cities requires collaboration among various stake-\nholders, which\
    \ may include government authorities, urban planners, industry partners,\ncommunity\
    \ and citizen groups, and academic and research institutions, among others.\n\
    As it is advocated by Clement et al. [68], the sharing of information, best practices,\
    \ and\nestablishing partnerships can help develop comprehensive cybersecurity\
    \ strategies and\nresponses to emerging threats. Public awareness and education\
    \ are another pillar of cy-\nbersecurity in smart cities. At this level, Williamson\
    \ [69] states that citizens should be\ninformed about potential risks, advised\
    \ on secure practices, and encouraged to report any\nsuspicious activities. It\
    \ is advocated that building a culture of cybersecurity awareness\ncan help prevent\
    \ attacks and ensure the collective security of the smart city ecosystem.\nOur\
    \ study demonstrates that collaborative efforts made at Europe-wide research projects\n\
    facilitate the sharing of threat intelligence and cybersecurity information among\
    \ different\nentities. This allows for a more comprehensive understanding of emerging\
    \ threats, attack\npatterns, and vulnerabilities. By staying informed about the\
    \ latest threats, smart cities can\nproactively implement countermeasures. Furthermore,\
    \ it is expected that cybersecurity\nchallenges in smart cities will continue\
    \ to evolve. Collaborative efforts enable ongoing\nadaptation to new threats and\
    \ technologies, ensuring that cities can maintain a robust\ncybersecurity posture\
    \ over the long term.\n3. Methodology\nThis study adopts qualitative methodology\
    \ to understand and characterize the role\nof cybersecurity in smart cities. According\
    \ to Hammarberg et al. [70], cybersecurity is\nmostly employed in situations where\
    \ one seeks to explore and describe in depth the\nnature, meanings, and characteristics\
    \ of a particular context, rather than seeking statistical\ngeneralizations. In\
    \ this study, qualitative methodology is used as a tool in the exploratory\nresearch\
    \ of cybersecurity in smart cities. Indeed, qualitative methodology is often used\
    \ at\nthe beginning of a research process to explore a little-known problem or\
    \ area of study. It\nhelps to generate hypotheses, identify relevant variables,\
    \ and gain a deeper understanding\nof the topic before developing more structured\
    \ research [71]. This exploratory research\nof the topic is later complemented\
    \ by an in-depth survey, which allows exploring the\nperspectives and experiences\
    \ of the various research projects in depth, which allows\ncapturing the complexity\
    \ and context of how cybersecurity is addressed in smart cities’\nresearch projects.\n\
    The CORDIS database is used to identify projects in smart cities that address\
    \ cyberse-\ncurity risks. CORDIS is maintained by the European Commission to provide\
    \ information\non the objectives, development status, and technical and scientiﬁc\
    \ outcomes of EU-funded\nresearch and development projects [72]. The search in\
    \ this database considered only the\nrepository of projects funded under the Horizon\
    \ Europe Framework Program, which is\nthe successor to the Horizon 2020 program\
    \ and spans the period from 2021 to 2027. The\nprogram aims to support scientiﬁc\
    \ research, technological development, and innovation\nacross various disciplines\
    \ and sectors. It is important to highlight that Horizon Europe\nencourages interdisciplinary\
    \ research, international cooperation, and open science prin-\nciples. External\
    \ and internal validity procedures have been considered. First, we have\nused\
    \ consistent search terms to identify relevant projects. Initially, a search was\
    \ made\nconsidering all projects funded by Horizon Europe in the smart cities\
    \ ﬁeld. This resulted in\nthe identiﬁcation of 180 projects. After that, the combination\
    \ of the three words “smart”\nand “city” and “security” was applied. It was also\
    \ ensured that the current state of devel-\nopment of the projects is relatively\
    \ similar. Therefore, all projects in the approval phase, or\napproved but not\
    \ yet started, have been excluded. In total, and after applying the listed\nrestrictions,\
    \ a total of 62 projects were identiﬁed as presented in Table 1. Associated with\n\
    each project is the date of its implementation (i.e., start date and end date)\
    \ and a brief\nFuture Internet 2023, 15, 285\n7 of 21\ndescription of its main\
    \ goal. The identiﬁcation of the goal of each project was manually\ncarried out\

    \ that enables\nautomation of high-mix, low-volume production.\nThe description\
    \ and objectives of the projects were subsequently uploaded into NVivo\nv12.2\
    \ software. NVivo is a software program developed for qualitative data analysis\n\
    that provides a set of tools and features to organize, analyze, and interpret\
    \ qualitative\ndata. It supports a wide range of qualitative research methods,\
    \ including content analysis,\ngrounded theory, and thematic analysis, among others.\
    \ In addition, the software offers\nadvanced analytic tools, including matrix\
    \ coding, concept mapping, sentiment analysis, and\ntext search queries, to help\
    \ researchers identify patterns, trends, and relationships in their\ndata. NVivo\
    \ also offers visualizations such as graphs, diagrams, and word clouds to help\n\
    interpret and present the results [73]. This study adopted thematic analysis to\
    \ ﬁnd the main\nthemes associated with the projects and subsequently identiﬁed\
    \ innovative approaches\nadopted in the projects to address cyber security risks.\
    \ Then, a conceptual map of the\nrelationship between the main cybersecurity challenges\
    \ in smart cities was developed,\nwhich guided the discussion of the innovative\
    \ proposals presented by these projects.\nTable 2 provides a global vision of\
    \ the several steps of thematic analysis. Eight phases are\nconsidered which include\
    \ the preparation of data, its coding, the process of identifying and\nreﬁning\
    \ themes throughout the process, and the production of the ﬁnal report.\nFuture\

    Description\nData preparation\nThe data collected on the CORDIS platform for each\
    \ project are compiled into an individual report. Information\non project name,\
    \ implementation dates, summary, objectives, and technical description are extracted.\
    \ These\nelements are available in “fact sheet” and “reporting” sections on CORDIS\
    \ platform. A script written in Python\nwas developed to automatically collect\
    \ this information.\nCodiﬁcation\nNVivo v12.2 software is used to assign codes\
    \ to text segments or signiﬁcant units of data that represent a speciﬁc\ntheme.\n\
    Identiﬁcation of initial themes\nInitial emerging themes are identiﬁed and highlighted\
    \ by Nvivo v12.2 software. Themes represent groups of\ncodes that share similar\
    \ characteristics.\nReview of themes\nThis step aims to review the identiﬁed themes\
    \ to ensure that they are aligned in the cybersecurity domain and are\nappropriately\
    \ relevant and comprehensive. It is also relevant to ensure that the themes correctly\
    \ capture the\nperspectives of each project.\nDeﬁnition and naming of\nthemes\n\
    Each theme is associated with a descriptive name to assist in the analysis and\
    \ production of the ﬁnal report.\nAnalysis of themes\nThe themes identiﬁed in\
    \ the previous step are analyzed to understand the relationships between them\
    \ and to\nhighlight how they contribute to the research questions formulated in\
    \ the study.\nInterpretation of results\nThe results obtained are discussed considering\
    \ the research objectives and the literature in the ﬁeld. Implications\nof the\
    \ themes are noted to guide the discussion of the ﬁndings.\nReporting of results\n\
    A detailed report of the identiﬁed themes and their deﬁnitions is produced. Original\
    \ citations are also collected\nfrom the studies that support each theme. The\
    \ implications of the research are also noted.\n4. Results\nThe thematic analysis\
    \ began by exploring the most frequent terms associated with the\nobjectives and\
    \ description of each project. Table 3 summarizes the top 10 frequent themes\n\
    considering the total number of times is the theme was identiﬁed in projects.\
    \ The most fre-\nquent themes include “smart cities” with 96 occurrences, “data-driven”\
    \ with 74 occurrences,\n“artiﬁcial intelligence” with 53 occurrences, “machine\
    \ learning” with 44 occurrences, and\n“digital environments” with 41 occurrences.\
    \ Other themes that stand out with less frequency\nare “privacy”, “sensors”, “education”,\
    \ “sustainability”, and “collaborative environment”.\nA signiﬁcant portion of\
    \ the terms identiﬁed are not directly related to cybersecurity in its\nmultiple\
    \ aspects, nor to the area of application to smart cities, but emerge as important\n\
    elements in the methodological and organizational processes of each project, such\
    \ as the\nsearch for artiﬁcial intelligence support in data analytics for decision\
    \ making and the role\nof collaborative environments in the development of these\
    \ technological solutions. Some\ncommon architectural components for the development\
    \ of smart cities are also identiﬁed,\nsuch as the exploitation of information\
    \ generated through data analytics techniques, the\nevolution of artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ that enables a more personalized interaction with citizens,\ninformation privacy,\
    \ and the role that the IoT can assume in various areas, such as urban\nmobility,\
    \ energy efﬁciency, and sustainability.\nThe next step in presenting the results\
    \ was to create a cognitive map to capture the\nvarious dimensions of cybersecurity\
    \ risks in smart cities. Figure 1 presents the multiple\ndimensions captured in\
    \ a cognitive map. A total of 7 dimensions and 31 sub-dimensions\nwere identiﬁed.\
    \ Cybersecurity risks in smart cities are grouped under dimensions such as\n“infrastructure\
    \ vulnerabilities”, “data privacy”, “network vulnerabilities”, “access control”,\n\
    “IoT devices”, “security standards and regulation”, and “human behavior”. It is\
    \ note-\nworthy that there is a strong dependence between the various dimensions.\
    \ Infrastructure\nvulnerabilities are divided into areas such as sensors and networks,\
    \ which then give rise to\nvulnerabilities supporting network communication in\
    \ smart cities and IoT devices. It is\nalso highlighted that the modular and collaborative\
    \ structure in the development of smart\ncities with multiple manufacturers and\
    \ technologies makes it difﬁcult to manage the entire\nnetwork in an integrated\
    \ way. Finally, human behavior makes the emergence of social\nengineering attacks\
    \ a possibility, in addition to being a challenge for digital inclusivity.\nFinally,\
    \ the security risks identiﬁed above are addressed by European research projects.\n\
    Several solutions are proposed in the technological, organizational, and human\
    \ behavior\ndomains. Table 4 identiﬁes mitigation proposals put forward by the\
    \ research projects. Three\nFuture Internet 2023, 15, 285\n11 of 21\nquotes from\
    \ the projects are provided, extracted from NVivo v12.2 software, on how the\n\
    research projects address mitigation proposals in each dimension. It is highlighted\
    \ that the\nmitigation proposals presented by the research projects highlight\
    \ their scope of application\nas smart infrastructure, urban mobility, energy\
    \ and sustainability, and quality of life. It\nalso stands out that the same project\
    \ (e.g., EDGELESS, PANTHEON) addresses multiple\ndimensions of cybersecurity in\
    \ a smart city.\nTable 3. Top 10 most frequent themes.\nFinal Theme\nAssociated\

    \ under Horizon Europe are a prime source of information\nfor understanding security\
    \ risks in smart cities. The EU has encouraged and funded several\ninitiatives\
    \ to promote the concept of smart cities and bring the poorest regions of the\
    \ EU\ncloser to the richest. European smart city projects often involve partnerships\
    \ between\ncities, businesses, research institutions, and civil society organizations.\
    \ They provide a\nframework for collaboration, sharing knowledge and good practices,\
    \ and provide ﬁnancial\nresources for implementing smart city solutions. The exploration\
    \ of these initiatives helps\nus to answer RQ1 and allows us to synthesize cyber\
    \ security risks in seven dimensions,\nand it is noted that the projects cover\
    \ all these multiple areas. The role of these initiatives in\nproviding a comprehensive\
    \ view of security risks is also noted. Thus, the risks of using\nemerging technologies\
    \ are compounded by regulatory difﬁculties in implementing smart\ncities and the\
    \ interaction of humans with smart cities.\nThe infrastructure of a smart city\
    \ is a critical element. Mitigation measures, as indi-\ncated in RQ2, should address\
    \ this central point of smart city architecture. As cities become\nmore reliant\
    \ on technology to operate, critical infrastructure becomes an attractive target\n\
    for cyberattacks. Furthermore, the interconnectivity of devices and systems in\
    \ smart cities\ncreates a larger attack surface for potential attackers. Several\
    \ mitigation measures can\nbe implemented, such as risk assessment and management,\
    \ continuous monitoring, and\nintrusion detection, among others. The vulnerabilities\
    \ existing in the security systems of a\nsmart city exist in several forms, such\
    \ as security breaches in communication networks,\nfailures in monitoring and\
    \ control systems, outdated systems, and lack of proper authen-\ntication, among\
    \ others [74,75]. Effectively, the continuous monitoring of security risks\nis\
    \ an activity that must be constantly performed to detect and respond to threats\
    \ in real\ntime. In Herath and Mittal [76], the role of security monitoring tools,\
    \ data analytics, and\nartiﬁcial intelligence to identify anomalies and suspicious\
    \ activities is highlighted. Artiﬁ-\ncial intelligence also poses new risks such\
    \ as autonomous learning models and Deepfake,\nwhich refers to the malicious use\
    \ of deep learning technology to create highly realistic and\noften misleading\
    \ fake content. Moreover, security risk management in smart cities is an\nongoing\
    \ process. Good practices in this area are addressed by Hui [77] and Younus [78],\
    \ by\nsuggesting conducting regular risk assessments, updating security measures\
    \ according to\nemerging threats, and participating in collaborative actions with\
    \ other smart cities to share\nknowledge and experiences. Privacy is another key\
    \ issue in smart cities. The large-scale\ncollection of personal information and\
    \ constant monitoring of individuals’ activities can\nraise legitimate concerns.\
    \ Smart cities must be transparent about their data collection\npractices and\
    \ involve citizens in the decision-making process. This includes providing\nclear\
    \ information about the technologies used, the expected beneﬁts, and the associated\n\
    privacy risks. Data collection is an activity that should be conducted in a transparent\n\
    and consenting manner, informing citizens of what data are collected, how they\
    \ are used,\nand who has access to it. How data are processed and stored is another\
    \ point that should\ndeserve attention. Faisal [79] points out that one way to\
    \ protect citizens’ privacy is to ensure\nthat the data collected are minimized,\
    \ anonymized, and aggregated wherever possible.\nThis means removing personally\
    \ identiﬁable information and grouping data at aggregate\nlevels to avoid identifying\
    \ speciﬁc individuals.\nThe cybersecurity risks identiﬁed are also strongly connected\
    \ with the emergence of\ndata-driven solutions in smart cities. Therefore, answering\
    \ RQ2 requires considering that\nArtiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) plays a pivotal role\
    \ in processing and analyzing vast amounts\nof data to optimize services and infrastructure.\
    \ AI’s rapid evolution has revolutionized\nvarious aspects of smart cities, enabling\
    \ them to make data-driven decisions, automate\nprocesses, and enhance citizen\
    \ experiences. In transportation, AI-powered algorithms\nmanage trafﬁc ﬂow, optimize\
    \ public transportation routes, and predict maintenance needs\nfor infrastructure\
    \ [80]. In energy management, AI enables real-time monitoring, demand-\nresponse\
    \ systems, and the optimization of energy consumption [81]. However, as smart\n\
    cities become more reliant on AI-driven systems, their susceptibility to cyber\
    \ threats\nFuture Internet 2023, 15, 285\n15 of 21\nincreases signiﬁcantly. Effectively,\
    \ as AI becomes increasingly integrated into smart cities,\nit also exposes these\
    \ urban environments to new cybersecurity challenges. Cyber threats\npose signiﬁcant\
    \ risks, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruptions, privacy\n\
    violations, and even physical harm [82,83]. One signiﬁcant concern is the potential\
    \ for AI\nmodels to be manipulated, leading to biased decision-making or malicious\
    \ actions. As\nstated by Anthi et al. [84], AI algorithms may be vulnerable to\
    \ adversarial attacks, where\nmalicious input data are crafted to deceive the\
    \ model. Additionally, Anwar and Ali [85]\nreveal that the centralization of data\
    \ in smart cities presents a potential target for hackers\nseeking to steal sensitive\
    \ information or hold it for ransom.\nDealing with the challenges of standards\
    \ and regulation in smart cities requires a col-\nlaborative and adaptive approach.\
    \ Ensuring interoperability between the different systems\nand devices in a smart\
    \ city is a challenge that must be considered in RQ2. Madsen [86] states\nthat\
    \ adopting open standards allows systems to communicate with each other efﬁciently,\n\
    avoiding dependence on speciﬁc vendors and promoting healthy competition. In addition,\n\
    standards also help to ensure data security and privacy. Importantly, smart cities\
    \ involve\na wide range of stakeholders, including governments, businesses, academic\
    \ institutions,\nand citizens. Promoting and establishing mechanisms for dialog\
    \ and collaboration among\nthese stakeholders can be used to develop appropriate\
    \ standards and regulations. Several\napproaches can be implemented in this ﬁeld,\
    \ such as the use of discussion forums, public\nconsultations, and public–private\
    \ partnerships [87,88]. Citizens are also a key pillar in\nthe implementation\
    \ of smart cities. Citizen ethics are important because they inﬂuence\npeople’s\
    \ behavior toward the use of these technologies and how they interact with the\n\
    smart city environment. Ethical citizens use the technologies available in smart\
    \ cities\nresponsibly. This includes not using digital tools for illegal or harmful\
    \ activities, respecting\nlaws and regulations related to cybersecurity, and avoiding\
    \ the misuse of others’ personal\ndata. Additionally, citizens’ ethics can be\
    \ promoted through educational programs and\nawareness about security in smart\
    \ cities. According to Ziosi [89], this involves disseminat-\ning information\
    \ about the risks and beneﬁts of the technologies used, the importance of\ndata\
    \ protection, and raising awareness about citizens’ rights and responsibilities\
    \ in a smart\ncity environment.\nThe strong technological interconnection in smart\
    \ cities allows them to collect, analyze\nand share data efﬁciently, making it\
    \ possible to operate and manage various urban aspects\nintelligently. However,\
    \ the proliferation of new technologies and the need to have a highly\nintegrated\
    \ environment means that new security risks are continuously emerging. The\nresearch\
    \ projects launched between 2022 and 2027 should not only address the main current\n\
    security risks, but should identify new risks that may emerge in the next decade,\
    \ which\ngives us relevant information to address RQ3. The PANTHEON project presents\
    \ the\nfollowing strategic vision:\n“PANTHEON will design and develop a Community\
    \ based Digital Ecosystem for Dis-\naster Resilience utilizing Smart City Digital\
    \ Twin (SCDT) technology and leveraging\nnew and emerging technologies and innovations\
    \ to improve risk assessment, reduce\nvulnerability, and building community disaster\
    \ resilience.” (PANTHEON)\nThe SCDT approach proposed in PANTHEON refers to a\
    \ comprehensive framework\nthat combines digital technologies, data analytics,\
    \ and modeling techniques to enhance dis-\naster preparedness, response, and recovery\
    \ in a smart city environment. A SCDT is referred\nto in Deren et al. [90] as\
    \ a virtual replica or simulation of a city’s physical infrastructure,\nsystems,\
    \ and processes. A SCDT integrates various data sources, such as Internet of Things\n\
    (IoT) devices, sensors, and real-time data feeds, to create a dynamic representation\
    \ of the\ncity. SCDT is a cutting-edge concept that contributes to better infrastructure\
    \ management,\nurban planning and design, and real-time decision making. Caprari\
    \ et al. [91] argue that\ndigital twins enable city planners and architects to\
    \ test and visualize various urban plan-\nning scenarios before implementing them\
    \ in the physical world. This helps in optimizing\nthe layout of infrastructure,\
    \ buildings, transportation networks, and public spaces, leading\nto more efﬁcient\
    \ and sustainable cities. Furthermore, the availability of real-time data from\n\
    Future Internet 2023, 15, 285\n16 of 21\nan SCDT empowers city ofﬁcials to make\
    \ informed and data-driven decisions promptly.\nCheng et al. [92] provide the\
    \ example that during emergencies or unexpected events, such\nas natural disasters\
    \ or trafﬁc congestion, authorities can quickly assess the situation and\nrespond\
    \ effectively.\nAnother emerging issue where the roles of cybersecurity and sustainability\
    \ are aligned\nis represented in the ambition of the CONCERTO project.\n“Clean\
    \ Aviation’s ambition to go over decisive impactful steps in demonstrated disruptive\n\
    aircraft performance compatible with 2035 EIS will only be possible if the future\
    \ regulatory\nframework is not an impediment to innovation.” (CONCERTO)\nAs reported\
    \ by Timperley [93], the aviation industry is a signiﬁcant contributor to\nglobal\
    \ greenhouse gas emissions, primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels in aircraft\n\
    engines. Clean aviation aims to address this issue by adopting various strategies\
    \ and\ntechnologies to increase the sustainability of air travel [94–96]. Furthermore,\
    \ CONCERTO\nproject exposes the potential cybersecurity risks raise in this context.\
    \ As aviation be-\ncomes increasingly digitized and connected, with the adoption\
    \ of technologies such as\nautonomous systems, IoT devices, and cloud computing,\
    \ the potential cybersecurity risks\nalso increase. Furthermore, a sustainable\
    \ organization aims to be resilient and adaptable\nto various challenges, including\
    \ cyber threats. Cybersecurity measures play a signiﬁcant\nrole in safeguarding\
    \ an organization’s ability to continue sustainable practices in the face\nof\
    \ potential disruptions or attacks. Therefore, sustainable practices should be\
    \ integrated\ninto business continuity and disaster recovery plans. Several strategies\
    \ like redundancy,\ngeographic diversity, and robust backup systems can help organizations\
    \ to protect data\nand infrastructure from cyber-attacks, natural disasters, or\
    \ other disruptive events [97–99].\nAnother area addressed by the projects is\
    \ smart agriculture as in the 3P-Tec project.\n“Changes in climate extremes (e.g.,\
    \ heatwaves, ﬂoods and drought) require new breeding\ntechnologies to allow farmers\
    \ to achieve high yields with climate-robust crops.” (3P-Tec)\nCybersecurity in\
    \ smart agriculture is a growing concern as the agricultural industry\nincreasingly\
    \ adopts digital and connected technologies to optimize crop production and\n\
    management. Smart farming, also known as precision agriculture, involves the use\
    \ of\nsensors, drones, IoT, and other technologies to collect data and automate\
    \ agricultural\nprocesses. While these technologies offer signiﬁcant beneﬁts such\
    \ as increased efﬁciency,\ncost reduction, and higher productivity, they can also\
    \ expose farming operations to cyber\nthreats. Some of the key cybersecurity challenges\
    \ in smart agriculture include connectivity,\ndata protection, phishing, and malware\
    \ [100–102].\nFinally, another area highlighted by research projects is the role\
    \ of entrepreneurship in\ncybersecurity. This perspective is addressed in projects\
    \ such as EHHUR.\n“Future adopters will beneﬁt from a DSS tool, supported by a\
    \ capacity building pro-\ngramme, that offers the ideal mix of best technical\
    \ solutions, optimal ﬁnancing schemes\nand engagement tools and social innovation\
    \ practice.” (EHHUR)\nDSS tools can be used in the context of smart cities for\
    \ resource allocation and pre-\ndictive analytics. Mahmood et al. [103] state\
    \ that DSS can optimize resource allocation\nby analyzing data on resource availability\
    \ and demand, ensuring that resources are uti-\nlized optimally. Osman and Elragal\
    \ [104] add that DSS can employ predictive analytics to\nforecast future trends\
    \ and events. This capability will allow city authorities to proactively\naddress\
    \ potential issues, plan for contingencies, and make informed decisions to improve\n\
    the city’s resilience. Also linked to the role that technology can play is the\
    \ importance of\nentrepreneurship in this ﬁeld. Entrepreneurs have the ability\
    \ to identify gaps in the cyberse-\ncurity market and understand the needs of\
    \ end users. They can ﬁnd business opportunities\nby realizing unsolved problems\
    \ or inadequate solutions existing in the cybersecurity ﬁeld.\nThis view is shared\
    \ by Aiyer et al. [105] and Alspach [106], when highlighting that many\nstartups\
    \ have emerged in the cybersecurity area, seeking to develop more effective and\n\
    Future Internet 2023, 15, 285\n17 of 21\naffordable solutions. Entrepreneurs found\
    \ these startups and brought together specialized\ncybersecurity talent to address\
    \ emerging challenges.\n6. Conclusions\nCybersecurity is a key element in the\
    \ context of smart cities. The high connectivity\nand high technological dependence\
    \ of smart cities increase the emergence of cyber risks.\nThe security of digital\
    \ systems and infrastructures is essential to ensure data protection,\ncitizens’\
    \ privacy, and the efﬁcient functioning of smart cities. The approach adopted\
    \ in this\nstudy complemented the systematic review works in the identiﬁcation\
    \ of key factors in the\nimplementation of smart cities and also the empirical\
    \ studies carried out in the speciﬁc\ncontext of smart city implementation. The\
    \ exploration of emerging security risks and the\nanalysis of proposals to mitigate\
    \ these risks based on research projects carried out in the\nEuropean context\
    \ allowed the risks identiﬁed to reﬂect not only the scientiﬁc perspective\nof\
    \ the research work, but also the technical and practical solutions that have\
    \ been proposed\nto make cities smarter supported by technology and optimization\
    \ of available resources.\nThis study identiﬁed that the main security challenges\
    \ facing smart cities cover several\nareas, such as the protection of technological\
    \ infrastructure, data privacy, network secu-\nrity, access control, IoT device\
    \ security, the adoption of standards and regulations in the\narea, and human\
    \ behavior. All these factors contribute to the implementation of robust\ncybersecurity\
    \ measures in all aspects of the planning, development, and operation of smart\n\
    cities, to ensure a safe and reliable digital environment for all involved. Furthermore,\
    \ this\nstudy identiﬁed emerging research areas in projects addressing topics\
    \ related to SCDT,\nclean aviation, smart agriculture, and data analytics that\
    \ bring new security challenges to\nsmart cities.\nThis study offers both theoretical\
    \ and practical contributions. In the conceptual\ndimension, this study contributed\
    \ to identifying the main cybersecurity risk areas to\nwhich smart cities are\
    \ exposed. It was possible to build a cognitive map consisting of\nseven dimensions\
    \ and identify mitigation measures to address these risks. Furthermore,\nthe identiﬁcation\
    \ of emerging cybersecurity research areas in smart cities includes the\nimplementation\
    \ of the concept of digital twins, smart aviation, smart agriculture, and the\n\
    emergence of new cybersecurity startups that bring new challenges to the management\
    \ of\nsmart cities using emerging technologies and living test labs. In the practical\
    \ dimension,\nthe ﬁndings of this study are relevant for researchers in the ﬁeld\
    \ who want to launch\nnew approaches and practical solutions to mitigate the risks\
    \ of smart cities and deepen\ntheir knowledge on this area. Also, the practical\
    \ results of this study are relevant for\nthe establishment of public policies\
    \ that can encourage the development of regulatory\ninstruments that facilitate\
    \ collaboration between the various stakeholders involved in the\nplanning and\
    \ implementation of a smart city.\nSome limitations should also be highlighted.\
    \ The database of research projects pro-\nvided by CORDIS is a rich and complementary\
    \ instrument of the scientiﬁc production\nassociated with each of the areas and\
    \ allows us to have a more comprehensive view of\nthe projects implemented on\
    \ a global scale considering the perspective of the various\nstakeholders. However,\
    \ the projects included in this database include only projects funded\nby the\
    \ European Commission, although they may include partners outside the European\n\
    Union. It is also relevant to note that the objectives proposed by these projects\
    \ at the time of\ntheir acceptance by the EU often have to be reformulated throughout\
    \ their implementation\nphase. This study does not cover this situation by capturing\
    \ only the objectives of the\nprojects in their design phase. In future work,\
    \ it would be interesting to explore how the\nobjectives of each project are modiﬁed\
    \ with the emergence of new security risks throughout\nits implementation cycle.\
    \ Another limitation of this study is the absence of a quantitative\nand comparative\
    \ metric that would allow us to assess the current relevance of each security\n\
    risk and its potential for growth over the course of this period of learning.\
    \ The study\nonly captured each of the dimensions of security risks without measuring\
    \ their relative\nprevalence. Therefore, for future works, it is suggested that\
    \ each of the security risks be\nFuture Internet 2023, 15, 285\n18 of 21\nassessed\
    \ considering their practical impact on building a smart city. This can be achieved\n\
    by carrying out a study considering the speciﬁc scenario of a smart city or adopting\
    \ a\nmore globalizing perspective and reﬂecting the perception of the various\
    \ stakeholders (e.g.,\ncompanies, public institutions, citizens, etc.) about these\
    \ risks.\nFunding: This research received no external funding.\nInstitutional\

    computing technologies have revolutionized every sphere of 21 st century humans.
    IoT technologies and the data driven services they offer were beyond imagination
    just a decade ago. Now, they surround us and influence a variety of domains such
    as automobile, smart home, healthcare, etc. In particular, the Agriculture and
    Farming industries have also embraced this technological intervention. Smart devices
    are widely used by a range of people from farmers to entrepreneurs. These technologies
    are used in a variety of ways, from finding real-time status of crops and soil
    moisture content to deploying drones to assist with tasks such as applying pesticide
    spray. However, the use of IoT and smart communication technologies introduce
    a vast exposure to cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities in smart farming
    environments. Such cyber attacks have the potential to disrupt the economies of
    countries that are widely dependent on agriculture. In this paper, we present
    a holistic study on security and privacy in a smart farming ecosystem. The paper
    outlines a multi layered architecture relevant to the precision agriculture domain
    and discusses the security and privacy issues in this dynamic and distributed
    cyber physical environment. Further more, the paper elaborates on potential cyber
    attack scenarios and highlights open research challenges and future directions.

    According to the United Nations (UN), the world population is expected to exceed
    9 billion people by 2050, growing by almost a third of the current population
    [1], [2]. Such an increase in the population demands a boost of almost 70 percent
    in the food production rate, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization
    of the United Nations.1 This rapidly growing population also introduces a variety
    of other problems such as increasing competition and exploitation of land, water
    and other natural resources. These issues present an urgent need to reduce the
    dependence of food system on our environment. Consequently, the need for an evolutionary
    agricultural paradigm to keep up with growing demand of food and crop production
    is necessary to guarantee a sustainable development [3]. Smart farming technologies2
    and precision agriculture3 [4] are gaining more attraction for their potential
    to fulfill such an increasing demand and meet global food supply needs. Smart
    farming technologies involve integration of technology and data driven agriculture
    applications to increase crop yield and quality of food products. There are numerous
    smart farming use cases [5]–[7] present globally indicating the impact of this
    new paradigm of practicing agriculture. As an example, the use of remote sensors
    placed in the soil for measuring blueberry irrigation in Chile has reduced the
    volume of water used in farming by 70 percent [8]. In India, farm data has been
    used to predict and prevent crop diseases, which reduced the risk associated with
    the failure of crop production [9]. Similar data driven approaches have helped
    fruit farmers in Slovenia effectively fight against pests.4 Smart farming, however,
    goes beyond primary production. In fact, it has impacted the complete food supply
    chain, by employing big data analytics to provide useful insights about the entire
    farming process [10] by facilitating real-time operational decision making, and
    revolutionizing existing agriculture business models. Smart farming enhances conventional
    farming practices by introducing on-field smart sensors and devices. These sensors
    and devices work in a synergistic manner to provide efficient farming experiences,
    as well as, an improved crop yield. Although beneficial to the productivity of
    the industry, the use of heterogeneous, internet-connected devices has exposed
    potential cyber attacks and vulnerabilities in the agriculture sector. These attacks
    introduce the ability to remotely control and exploit on-field sensors and autonomous
    vehicles (tractors, aerial vehicles, etc). Potential agricultural attacks can
    create an unsafe and unproductive farming environment. For example, exploits that
    have the ability to destroy an entire field of standing grown crops, flood the
    farmlands, over spray pesticides using smart drones, etc. can cause unsafe consumption
    as well as economic deterioration. Such attacks in a large coordinated manner,
    also referred to as agro-terrorism [11], also have the potential of disrupting
    the economy of an agriculture-dependent nation. A report [12] released by the
    U.S. Department of Homeland Security extensively elaborates various cyber threat
    scenarios in precision agriculture, further emphasizing the need for research
    in this critical domain. The Agriculture industry adds 6.4 percent of the world’s
    economic production with a total of $5,084,800 million.5 Agriculture, food, and
    related industries contributed $1.053 trillion to U.S. gross domestic product
    (GDP) in 2017.6 At the same time, United State’s farms contributed $132.8 billion
    of this sum which is almost 1 percent of GDP. Agriculture contributed 1.2 % to
    the European Union’s (EU) GDP in 2017 whereas EU’s agricultural industry added
    gross value of EUR 188.5 billion in 20177 at a record high. Out of 226 countries,
    nine countries have agriculture sector as the dominant sector in their economy.
    The U.S. food and agriculture system has a total economic impact of $7.06 trillion8
    and one-fourth of the overall jobs in the country are connected to it. Most countries
    globally export agricultural products. As a result, cyber vulnerabilities can
    have a significant impact on global food security. A sophisticated agro-terrorism
    attack on a (large) exporting country like the U.S. could harm the health of millions
    of consumers world-wide. In addition, attacks could reduce confidence on domestic
    consumption and destroy the United State’s status as a trusted food exporter.
    A report released in 2018 by the Council of Economic Advisors,9 “The Cost of Malicious
    Cyber Activity to the U.S. Economy” suggests the agriculture sector as one of
    the 16 critical infrastructure sectors that are important to both the U.S. economy
    and national security for which cyber protection is particularly important. It
    also reported that the agriculture sector experienced 11 cyber incidents in 2016.
    According to the World Health Organization,10 420,000 people die every year from
    food-related illnesses and 600 million people fall ill as a result of food contaminated
    with bacteria, viruses, toxins or chemicals. A cyber attack on the food ecosystem
    targeted at farms, transportation system, or food processing industrial control
    systems (ICSs) may increase these numbers exponentially. Other important industries
    like energy, financial or healthcare have understood the need for resilient infrastructure
    and have hardened their defenses. However, the food and agriculture industry is
    still a low hanging fruit for threat actors. Food Protection and Defense Institute
    (FPDI) at the University of Minnesota has discovered that food industry ICSs may
    be distinctly vulnerable to cyberattacks.11 Food industry operations technology
    personnel, in particular, those responsible for operating and maintaining ICSs,
    are experts trained in food and production safety production and not in cybersecurity.
    This presents a huge gap between employing smart farm technology and securing
    it correctly and persistently. If not continuously monitored, cyber attacks on
    smart agriculture technologies can have grave implications on several stakeholders
    in the ecosystem. These groups include farmers, end consumers, food processing
    industries, agriculture co-operatives, livestock, government agencies and nations
    critically dependent on agriculture. Figure 1, shows an end to end interaction
    among various entities involved in smart farming ecosystem. Physical sensors and
    livestock in the field generate data and receive command operations via user applications.
    These on-farm devices are connected to gateway supported edge nodes, which help
    enable in-farm device communication, filter sensor data and real time agronomy
    analytics. At the same time, data lakes in the cloud hold a large amount of data
    and information including but not limited to, environmental information (e.g.
    soil moisture level and fertility status), monitoring information (e.g. sensors
    and smart machinery status), energy management data, and other sensitive information.
    In terms of security and data privacy, it is needless to say that manipulation
    and leakage of such data, as well as the impairment of physical equipment and
    software systems, can induce serious consequences. FIGURE 1. A model of end-to-end
    interaction between various stakeholders in smart farming. Show All Extensive
    research on secure IoT devices [13]–[15], smart vehicles [16]–[19], drones [20],
    [21], edge cloud [22]–[24], wireless communication [25]–[27] is already available
    and might be extended to the smart farming ecosystem. However, most of the time,
    research is conducted on these technologies without consideration of the environment
    they are used. The dynamic smart farming environment, has unique characteristics
    such as farm equipment, labor sharing, and operational decisions, influenced by
    environmental conditions. Domain specific issues such as like location, user skill
    set, insider threats, generated data, need smart-farming-specific security mechanisms.
    The development of smart farm technologies therefore, demands further research
    before wide adoption in the community. The current state of the art and our review
    (discussed in Section V) on smart farming, demands further research in security
    and privacy aspects of this evolving domain. As the research, on cybersecurity
    for smart farming is in its infancy, our objective in this review is to provide
    a holistic view of cybersecurity developments in smart farming. In this paper,
    we discuss current threats, analyze potential cybersecurity attacks, review the
    existing scattered security research, and summarize open research challenges in
    the smart farming field as illustrated in Figure 2. FIGURE 2. A roadmap of cybersecurity
    research and challenges in smart farming. Show All This paper has the following
    key contributions: It provides an overview of smart farming focused multi-layered
    architecture, highlighting multiple entry points and communication across layers.

    enlists the focus, contributions and weaknesses of current research works. It
    provides a clear view of the open security research challenges in different areas
    including next generation network security, trustworthy supply chain and compliance,
    adversarial machine learning and AI, and access control, trust and information
    sharing. The remainder of this paper is as follows. Multi-layered architecture
    for smart farming is discussed in Section II. Section III elaborates security
    and privacy issues, whereas Section IV discusses different attacks on the smart
    farming ecosystem including the supply chain side. Existing research and state
    of the art in smart farming security is discussed in Section V. Section VI highlights
    open research challenges and possible approaches to solutions. Finally, Section
    VII draws conclusion to this research paper. SECTION II. Smart Farming Landscape
    & Architecture Figure 3, depicts a multi layer architecture for the smart farming
    ecosystem. The proposed architecture adapts and extends widely discussed IoT and
    Cyber Physical System (CPS) multi-layer architectures [28]–[31]. These architectures
    recognize the use of cloud and edge services, and the infinite capabilities provided
    by them to fully harness the data generated from smart devices at the physical
    layer [32]–[37]. Our smart farming architecture, also reflects different user
    applications which can be envisioned at various layers. It also considers, vast
    amounts of data collected at edge or cloud layers, and highlights the need for
    various multi-cloud or edge-cloud scenarios. Overall the architecture consists
    of four layers: Physical layer, Edge layer, Cloud layer, and Network Communication
    layer. The latter spans across all three previous layers and connect them. FIGURE
    3. Multi layer smart farming architecture. Show All A. Physical Layer The bottom
    layer in the architecture comprises of real physical sensors and gateway devices
    which are spread across agriculture farms or in greenhouse buildings. These devices
    include drones flying in the air, autonomous tractors, sensors embedded in livestock,
    or hub devices installed to provide communication among smart objects or with
    a central cloud. These devices are responsible for data sensing and based on the
    information gathered, help in actuating other devices to realise various smart
    farming use cases. They collect real time information about weather conditions,
    soil moisture level, or cattle’s body temperature, which can be sent to the edge
    or cloud supported intelligent decision making systems to provide recommendations
    and enable automation. For example, data gathered from soil moisture sensing device
    in the field, after getting processed in the edge or cloud, can help in determining
    the amount of water needed at the farm, optimize irrigation schedule and offers
    a convenient experience to the end farmers. B. Edge Layer This layer is near to
    the end-users and end-devices for local real-time computations and decisions.
    It reduces the computation load off the centralized cloud layer and also the network
    load. Edge computing layer consists of multiple edge nodes. Each node represents
    a gateway that include services such as: data capturing, security monitoring and
    detection, prediction and real-time decision support. Data capturing services
    include, data aggregation, filtering, encrypting and encoding of real-time data
    streams. Prediction services usually rely on machine learning models trained on
    the central cloud and deployed on the edge layer. They are used to predict and/or
    categorize certain events related to plant or livestock such as, prediction of
    crop yield, categorization of plants or livestock health, predictions about the
    amount of fertilizer and water needed for a patch of land, so as to maximize yield,
    or estimating soil erosion. Security monitoring and detection mechanisms can be
    deployed for real-time monitoring of anomalous events and classifying these events
    as malicious or benign. This includes services like, anomaly detection and device
    failures prediction. C. Cloud Layer Precision Agriculture (PA) and cloud computing
    paradigms offer advances to enhance PA connectivity. The cloud layer is generally
    virtualized in data centers and communicates with the other layers using the Internet.
    Generally, these cloud layer platforms follow the Platform as a Service (PaaS)
    architecture model where the users can focus on running applications and importing
    their data. The PaaS provider runs and maintains a data broker that collects data
    being pushed in from the edge layer and saves these records in a Distributed File
    System (DFS). This stored data is used by analytic software to mine knowledge.
    This data analytics component computes insights and these are pushed to the end
    user through a client application running on the users’ machine. Popular farm
    equipment manufacturers like, John Deere,12 Farmers Business Network,13 etc. have
    created several cloud based products that help users monitor various sensors and
    vehicles used on a farm. These PaaS systems generally run on popular cloud computing
    platforms like Amazon Web Services,14 Google Cloud,15 etc. The way these farming
    PaaS systems are built using these popular cloud computing platforms also introduce
    various security challenges in smart farming ecosystem. D. Network Communication
    Layer The common theme for most, if not all, current technologies is “connectivity”.
    With a growing need for a boundary-less Internet, the idea of a network of smart
    devices has become a reality. This concept, known as the Internet of Things (IoT),
    allows connected devices to be monitored, controlled, and shared data among each
    other. This data can be analyzed and used by multiple applications. In smart farming,
    as shown in Figure 3, the network layer not only facilitates edge and physical
    layer connectivity, but also provides an interface for them to interact with the
    cloud layer. From exchanging soil temperature through a peer-to-peer sensor communication
    system, to sending farm monitoring data to the cloud data stores through high
    speed mobile networks such as 5G [38], or updating the farmer about corp quality
    via a wireless adhoc topology [39], network layer offers a means of communication
    to bind all other layers. Network layer has two main responsibilities in a smart
    farming system. Firstly, there are diverse set of heterogeneous devices in every
    layers of a smart farming system. The network layer provides a secure and efficient
    network stack where, wire, wireless and mobile sub-networks can communicate in
    a compatible and cross-layer manner. The second responsibility of the layer is
    to preserve connectivity and therefore, increase availability. From bigdata processing
    systems used to analyze collected data to individual sensors that collect information
    from the field, this layer is needed for system-wide cyber communication. Real
    World Smart Farming Use Cases: The proposed smart farming architecture is constructed
    based on multiple literature and real world smart farming use cases. It can be
    viewed as a general smart farming architecture that satisfies most of the use
    cases. However, it should be noted that not all use cases will include all four
    layers as proposed in the architecture. Blackhills Farm in New Zealand, a 400-hectare
    property with over 2000 cattle and 800 sheep, has adopted the use of SCADAfarm16
    system which allows the owners to remotely monitor water and energy consumption,
    location of irrigators, soil moisture measurements and real-time weather information.
    The farm uses Schneider Electrics’s EcoStuxture IoT architecture17 which corresponds
    to our physical layer and sensors. It also utilizes Microsoft Azure18 IoT suite
    with communication provided by the Vodafone New Zealand cellular network which
    corresponds to the cloud and network layer in out framework. Similarly, a 7,000-acre
    farm at Beltsville Area Research Center, was developed by the United States Department
    of Agriculture (USDA) to act as a testbed for smart farming technologies. The
    farm was equipped with a physical layer including sensors, drones and IoT-enabled
    farm equipment for a public-private program called Farmbeats [5]. The farm adopts
    a two-layer hybrid network: a layer based on TV White Spaces [40] technology for
    connectivity over long range which connects the farmer’s home Internet connection
    to IoT base stations on the farm, and a layer based on Wi-Fi technology which
    connects smart sensors to the IoT base stations. Such IoT base stations (gateways)
    are equivalent to the edge cloud layer (Figure 3) in our proposed general architecture.
    Additionally, the data collected at the IoT stations are pushed to the cloud layer
    which employs AI algorithms for data analysis. Another usecase is a revolutionary
    step towards smart crop health monitoring. A group of researchers19 along with
    local farmers are developing a distributed airborne monitoring system to detect
    possible zones of crop damage or nutrient deficiency at a 492-acre farm in in
    North Carolina, United States. In order to accommodate rapidly-growing food demands
    and increase the quality and quantity of agricultural production, it is necessary
    to improve farming management practices and technological developments in agricultural
    fields. Accordingly, unlike traditional crop management methods that use farmers
    or ground vehicles for assessing crop health status, this collaborative smart
    farming project is using autonomous technology to perform aerial monitoring of
    agricultural fields to save time and money, while preventing damage to crops.
    In this project, a group of drones which monitor the field are working in the
    physical layer, as depicted in Figure 3. Drones communicate with each other through
    network layer, using which they also send collected data and images to land processing
    bases (i.e. the edge layer in our proposed architecture) for initial data cleaning
    and pre-processing. Finally, pre-processed data is sent to the cloud layer for
    storing and knowledge extraction functionalities. SECTION III. Security & Privacy
    Issues The adoption of sensor based technologies and cloud supported smart applications
    in agriculture has unleashed opportunities for adversaries to orchestrate cyber
    attacks. Therefore, it is important to first understand major security and privacy
    issues in smart farming domain before discussing specific cyber attacks. In this
    section, we will elaborate these issues in detail followed by attacks in the following
    section. A. Data Security & Privacy In a smart farm, an enormous amount of complex,
    dynamic and spatial data gets generated from many heterogeneous sensors, devices
    and equipment. Leakage of such information either through unauthorized access
    or by an insider can cause potential threats. For example, leakage of agriculture
    anti-jamming devices information can help an attacker bypass these security measures,
    while leakage of soil, crop, and agriculture purchase information can cause severe
    economic losses to farmers, if such information is used by competitors or hostile
    actors. On a larger scale, aggregating important agricultural information on a
    particular country is also a potential threat. As such data security and privacy
    is a very important requirement and one of the primary objectives to ensure the
    reliable operation in a smart farming ecosystem. Data on the Edge: Smart farms
    leverage Internet of Things (IoT), state-of-the-art communications (e.g., 5G),
    and artificial intelligence. Such systems mostly require fast response times,
    than those of a traditional model in which data is transmitted to a centralized
    data center (e.g., cloud) for processing and results are returned to a user. As
    such, the need of edge cloud is on the rise. Although moving data processing and
    analytics to the edge enhances agility and efficiency, to say the least, it also
    imposes huge security risks due to the increased attack surface primarily because
    of the highly diverse use of IoT devices which are usually not built with security
    in mind. This gives attackers an easy entry point to the network since remote
    access to the edge layer, in most cases, is essential. Additionally, finding the
    IP addresses of edge endpoints become an easy task especially when considering
    websites like Shodan,20 a search engine for all IoT connected devices. Beside
    directly compromising IoT devices or edge endpoints to gain access to the smart
    farm network, an indirect attack to compromise third parties is also a potential
    risk. As an example, smart farms often use third party agronomy analytics to analyze
    the collected data which can be used in many research areas such as plant biology
    and genetics, agriculture economy, supply forecasts, and disease predictions.
    Those parties might be given direct access to smart farm data on the edge for
    real-time analytics. An attacker might phish for such third parties, compromise
    their systems and inject malicious software to redirect the data sent to external
    servers for data theft. Such attacks are very hard to detect, since attackers
    are using legitimate stolen third party credentials. B. Authorization & Trust
    In smart farming applications, connected entities including autonomous tractors,
    flying drones, on field sensors etc. communicate and interact with each other,
    and issue command and control operations to provide automated and efficient experience.
    Such communication can be direct machine to machine or via a cloud or edge assisted
    network which can support Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT21), Constrained
    Application Protocol (CoAP22) or other IoT communication protocols. In either
    case, it is essential to ensure that the messages are sent from a trusted authorized
    entity, rather from a malicious adversary. This exchange of information, like
    moisture level of soil, information about crop yield, cost of fertilizer, or sensitive
    data about the livestock like health, current location, breeding decision information
    and other farm related private data sent to the cloud or to a third-party application
    must be authorized by the owner of the field or a concerned party. Livestock are
    important part of agriculture, and a big component of a farmer’s income. Sensors
    can be embedded in the cattle [41]–[43] which can monitor their health and can
    be used to remotely inject medicines or enable preventive actions from a doctor.
    Even in case of livestock purchase, buyer can be given temporary access to the
    data of an animal they are interested in, which can help them analyse it before
    purchase. As these animals are kept in monitored environments, remotely controlling
    the temperature or making adverse conditions in barn can affect the yield of animals,
    and can also result in epidemics and widespread disease. Over the air (OTA) updates
    for the equipment’s firmware must be from a trusted party, a bad software patch
    received for a critical agriculture equipment can curtail a farmer from using
    it at the needed time of harvesting and planting. Cross cloud and multi cloud
    trust models [44], [45] are needed when entities associated at different cloud
    providers interact and access data remotely. In case of a mechanic trying to diagnose
    an engine of an autonomous tractor, or a doctor trying to access data of a cattle
    located in a private cloud, trust levels need to be established so as to enable
    such access. Several access control models have been proposed for IoT [46]–[58]
    like systems, however their feasability in dynamic smart farming is still to be
    investigated. Proper authorization is needed for a farmer to issue a command,
    to a smart water sprinkler, or to fetch the latest readings from a soil moisture
    sensor. Farm rivalry can exploit such connectivity to the sensors, and may flood
    a farmer’s field, or make it parched. Usually in farms, labor is hired on a temporary
    basis mostly at the time of harvesting and sowing, therefore, temporary access
    to smart equipment can be delegated to on field workers for non-critical operations.
    It may be the case that a critical operation, like running an autonomous tractor
    on the field, or flying a drone over the field to spray pesticides may need multi
    level authorization. C. Authentication & Secure Communication One of the most
    important aspects of security and privacy in smart farming is authentication of
    connected devices. Devices need to be authenticated first in order to get connected
    to various services on a smart farming system. They are usually low power devices,
    with limited processing power, memory, and storage, so legacy public-key infrastructure
    (PKI) authentication mechanisms cannot be considered as feasible solutions. Alternatively,
    secure lightweight multi-factor authentication protocols which are offered as
    a service [13], [59] are more realistic solutions in a smart farming network environment.
    In fact, an intermediary Certifying Authority (CA) can facilitate the authentication
    of a connecting device [60]. Such authentication mechanisms do not consume devices’
    limited resources for authentication processing, but also unauthorized devices
    will be prevented from connecting and accessing the network in an efficient way
    [61]. Moreover, devices may sometime join or leave different layers of a smart
    farming ecosystem. This entails dynamic authenticated mechanisms that apply authentication
    on demand to ensure that only legitimate devices are allowed to have access to
    different services spanning over different layers. Providing end to end secure
    communication in a smart farming setting requires securing the communication between
    devices in a particular layer and also securing the inter-layer communication
    [62]. While cryptography-based solutions prove their effectiveness in securing
    both intra-layer and inter-layer communications, employing them on constrained
    IoT devices is a big concern. There are, however, limited attempts to apply lightweight
    cryptography solutions to a smart farming ecosystem [14]. Additionally, quantum-based
    cryptography for a secure end to end communication for IoT devices is under active
    investigation [63] as a futuristic solution. However, the feasibility of such
    solutions have not been evaluated in real world scenarios. D. Compliance and Regulations
    Smart farming and precision agriculture raises various legal issues, which remain
    partially unanswered. The following are some of the major issues in this area.
    1) Contracts and Agreements A smart farm involves different parties like the farmers,
    the cloud service providers, the networking infrastructure providers, to name
    a few (See Section II). These different parties need to negotiate and agree on
    various parts of contracts [12], [64]. These contracts include data privacy, security
    and intellectual property protection clauses. Data protection is essential for
    the development of smart farms and is a major part of these contracts. Such contracts
    between interested parties are crucial to protect the value and confidentiality
    of the data as an important asset. Farmers who use smart farming tools also need
    to negotiate in advance finer elements of these contracts. For example, which
    party shall be responsible in case data processing and analysis lead to wrong
    decisions affecting different downstream tasks in the pipeline. Another important
    contractual element example is the decision involving use of self-driving tractors,
    which are subject to the set of obligations applicable to self-driving cars. In
    this scenario, strong compensation and limitation of liability clauses may help
    the farmers. 2) Data Security and Privacy Farmers who deploy smart infrastructure
    fear that their data might be stolen by competitors or be publicly released. Hence,
    data security is crucial and agreements with technology providers should include
    specific clauses. Although most smart farming techniques process non-personal
    data, linking of such information to a particular personally identifiable information
    (PII) poses serious concerns [12], [64]. For example, data of livestock directly
    referring to their owner; crops conditions linked to farmers’ personal details.
    In this case, privacy clauses should be included to prohibit personal data processing
    to a certain degree. Further issues may arise when smart farming equipment, such
    as drones or tractors, have the functionality to monitor their users [12], [64].
    3) Intellectual Property (IP) An important question from a compliance perspective
    is who owns the data collected on a smart farm. This is specially important as
    data privacy laws cannot solve this issue. As per the current regulatory setup,
    data itself cannot be protected, however copyright provisions can be utilized
    to achieve high level of safeguards. Most farmers include IP protection clauses
    [64] in contracts that they create with smart farming technology providers [12].
    4) Regulatory Agriculture and livestock production is a highly regulated industry.
    Various countries across the globe have many laws, regulations, and supervisory
    authorities [65]–[67]. These touch upon specific compliance requirements for producing
    and selling of products. Such compliance can be achieved easier by using smart
    farming technology that help farmers and regulators track, audit, and inspect
    every step of the production pipeline. 5) Cyber Insurance Cyber Insurance allows
    victims to protect themselves from various cyber risks. However, cyber insurance
    policies in agriculture have lagged in the coverage of cyber incidents and events.
    Most of the current available agriculture based cyber insurances are very ambiguous
    and limited in their coverage [64]. SECTION IV. Smart Farming Ecosystem Cyber
    Attacks This section elaborates possible cyber attacks in smart farming ecosystem.
    We have categorized attacks into four different classes as shown in Figure 4.
    We have discussed data specific and network specific attacks orchestrated on smart
    farms including IoT based farming sensors. We have also explored cyber attacks
    from the supply chain side to highlight the vulnerabilities as more and more systems
    get connected to the internet and generating sensitive data. FIGURE 4. Smart farming
    ecosystem cyber attacks. Show All A. Data Attacks 1) Insider Data Leakage Farmers
    fear leakage of confidential data the most among other threats as it can be used
    against them in the commodity market. An insider (like a disgruntled employee)
    can leak such data to intentionally cause harm or sell data for money. For example,
    a former engineer at Allen and Hoshall was able to access the company’s data over
    a period of two years.23 Data this employee accessed included engineering schematic,
    project proposals, and marketing information which had an estimated value of $500,000.
    2) Cloud Data Leakage Smart farming data is very sensitive and can reveal a lot
    of confidential agriculture and economic information about the entire country.
    Cloud data centers are distributed across the world and, in some instances, virtual
    machines might be placed in data centers located in different countries. Data
    might be less secure if it is stored in data centers in other countries. These
    countries could place less strict security requirements on companies. Additionally,
    their governments might also intercept or collect that data stored on servers
    within their own jurisdictions. For these reasons, countries have started adding
    laws for sensitive data localization. For instance, China has placed a new cybersecurity
    law24 into effect in 2017 stating, among other things, that personal data must
    be stored on domestic servers. As such, companies like Microsoft, Google and Amazon
    started taking steps to transfer control of Chinese data to Chinese firms. 3)
    False Data Injection Attack In this attack, an attacker attempts to change/falsify
    data that contributes to important real-time decisions, with the assumption that
    adversary has the knowledge of the system and its configuration. For example,
    injecting false information about the soil moisture level will result in over
    watering and, in turn, damaging the crops. 4) Misinformation Attack In this attack,
    the aim is to endanger data integrity. An attacker may release false data about
    a smart farm claiming the outbreak of a disease in crops or livestock. Such false
    data reports mimic the form of an actual report released by the targeted smart
    farm. As a result, it will take a lot of time, effort and money to prove that
    the released report is false. B. Networking and Equipment Attacks 1) Radio Frequency
    (FR) Jamming Attack In many cases, smart farming equipment rely on radio frequency
    communication, like cellular or satellite networks. A smart farming equipment
    often use global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) to improve efficiency with
    products and techniques such as path planning, auto steering, seeding and spray
    rates. GNSS is achieved by combining GPS with real time kinematics (RTK) technology
    to enhance the precision of real-time position data. Attackers may jam GNSS for
    malicious purpose by deploying many distributed low power jammers to disrupt GNSS
    over wide areas and, in turn, prevent smart farming equipment from functioning
    properly. 2) Malware Injection Attack One of the most prevalent threats to smart
    farming is malware injection attack [68], where an attacker injects a malware
    into a connected smart device. Malware is a very common threat in large scale
    systems since, in most cases, it acts and propagates through the system automatically,
    hence making it a very attractive target to attackers. Precision agriculture is
    being adopted widely, meaning that more farms are connected to the internet. Typically,
    most of these farm deployments use similar software components (e.g., usage of
    LoRa25 and ZigBee26). As a result, a malware that infects a particular smart farm
    will most likely infect other farms with similar deployments. The damage caused
    by malware comes in many shapes and types. Malware can steal information about
    the consumption of agricultural materials, purchase information of fruits, vegetables
    and livestock, data about agricultural machinery etc. It can also recruit smart
    devices as part of a botnet which will be used for committing malicious acts controlled
    by an attacker. Further, malware can hinder the functions of physical smart equipment
    which, in turn, can have a devastating effect on a particular crop harvest or
    farm area. 3) Denial of Service Attack IoT devices used in smart farming environments
    can always be used to launch large scale denial of service (DoS) attacks [69]
    similar to what happened in 2016 using Mirai botnet [70]. In that occasion, an
    army of dummy CCTVs was exploited to launch one of the biggest DoS attacks that
    happened recently. There are usually a large number of inter-connected nodes and
    groups in a farm, and thus, similar type of attacks are possible in context of
    smart farming. These attacks not only can disrupt normal functions of different
    modules in an individual farm but also can be leveraged to interrupt legitimate
    cyber services in other domains. 4) Botnet With IoT everything is capable of getting
    connected to the internet. In smart farming ecosystem, there are many IoT related
    devices at each architectural layer. These devices are prone to attacks and can
    then be controlled by a central malicious system. This forms a so called ‘Botnet
    of Things’ [71]. A zombie army of infected farm IoT devices [72] can easily be
    used to infect many other networks through different mediums and hence a smart
    farm may turn out to be an internet of vulnerabilities for cyber criminals. Smart
    farm devices are not built with security as a concern and even if they do, users
    usually neglect the basic steps of setting adequate cybersecurity defense mechanisms.
    5) Side Channel Attack Attacks which have their roots in gaining information from
    how a system is implemented rather than what weakness exists in the system implementation
    are called side channel attacks. Smart farming is one of the IoT use case and
    hence it inherits some common IoT vulnerabilities including side channel attacks
    [73]. In such attacks, there are different channels which can be exploited by
    attackers. In timing channel attacks, for example, computation time along with
    cache miss and cache hit timing patterns are among those attacks vectors which
    can be exploited by adversaries. Hardware glitching in forms of voltage fluctuations
    and variances in system clock period during execution tasks are other possible
    attack channels. Other channels for launching a successful attack are power consumption
    patterns, possible electromagnetic leaks or even sound and acoustic channels.
    C. Supply Chain Attacks The entire agriculture ecosystem and the notion of ‘farm
    to plate’ involves several entities which work in tandem to provide quality food
    to the end consumer in a just-in time environment. This supply chain system [74]
    starts from the farm, which produces raw material that, in turn, is stored and
    processed by the food industry. The processed food is packed and sent to distribution
    retailer from where the end customer purchases processed goods. With IoT technology
    at each stage of the supply chain, it introduces potential cybersecurity threats
    since a security breach in just-in-time distribution system could also have a
    serious cascading effects on the entire supply chain. The massive scale of attacks
    like WannaCry27 ransomware, and the recent spate of ransomwares in cities28 across
    the US, suggest that even a breach or data freeze at a single inter-dependent
    entity will be enough to disrupt the whole chain and possibly the economy of a
    country. An attack on the agriculture equipment and fertilizer provider companies
    could potentially disable critical connected machinery needed at a prime time.
    It could manipulate the amount of nutrients in the fertilizers [64] which could
    seriously destroy the crops rather than nourishing them. The smart devices can
    be infected by malware which are controlled and commanded remotely. In such a
    scenario, large scale attacks can be orchestrated on all the smart farms utilizing
    those compromised machinery resulting in massive disruption in the sector. Needless
    to say that the suppliers of such machinery might loose trust and confidence of
    their customers. Such smart machinery needs dynamic calibration to determine the
    distance at which seeds need to be planted or the amount of fertilizers to be
    sprayed based on historical crop data. This calibration related information is
    uploaded in the machine software over-the-air (OTA), which suggests that deliberate
    uploading of false information to the machine software can have larger scale impact.
    US Foods29 has more than 250,000 customers which purchase supplies, will be affected
    badly if US Foods IT infrastructure is hit by a ransomware or a cyber attack disrupting
    its computer assisted facility and impacting critical processes. Temperature and
    conditions under which the produce is transferred is an important factor to maintain
    the freshness of the product. Smart monitors ensure that products are processed
    and packed at appropriate temperatures. Adversaries can manipulate these sensor
    readings or issue a command to change the temperature that could result in inappropriate
    temperature conditions for produce, which can impact the end consumers as well
    as the entire supply chain. These attacks are not limited to direct stakeholders,
    but for example, contaminated water from a compromised water treatment facility
    used in irrigation can destroy the whole crop field. Even attacks on smart grid
    due to sudden surge in demand and grid overloading can result in blackout which
    in-turn can spoil the stored produce in large storage houses, inducing huge losses
    to the supplier. Blockchain30 based solutions have been proposed to ensure the
    provenance of the food products in the chain, which offers transparency and assure
    quality of the food. However, the entire cost to use this system will not be clear
    unless widely adopted [75]. Smart farming goes beyond agriculture where livestock
    sector is also considered an important part. An attack on this sector can also
    have massive disruptions, where a malicious actor can publish false data about
    a disease outbreaks or unapproved genetic modifications of crops. Similarly, sensors
    and smart devices in the buildings where these livestock are kept can be attacked
    or altered to change the temperature, which can put to harm the entire livestock
    on the farm. Also, for livestock feed products, if an IT system monitoring the
    ingredients of the feed is compromised, it can potentially lead to wide-spread
    contamination in livestock which can easily reach humans as well. D. Other Relevant
    Attacks 1) Compliance and Regulation Food production and farming are a highly
    regulated industry with different countries having multiple national agencies
    monitoring food production. In the United States, Environment Protection Agency
    [65] and the Department of Agriculture [66] enforce various regulations and industry
    standards. In the European Union, Department of Agriculture and Rural Development
    [67] undertakes this responsibility with similar authorities in other countries.
    These federal authorities issue compliance directives to ensure quality food production.
    With the advent of smart farming technology these agencies are relying more and
    more on data produced by farm based sensors. An adversary attacking a smart farm
    can specifically inject false data that will then impact various compliance certification
    processes. This certification process if invalidated, can impact a nation’s food
    supply, affect crop price, etc. The complex smart farming ecosystem, creates a
    broad attack surface that needs to be protected to ensure data integrity. 2) Cyber
    Terrorism The increased use of digital interconnected system in agriculture sector
    brings new opportunities for terrorists to attack places that previously were
    too remote or difficult to strike. Cyber terrorism is a relatively low-cost venture
    with high payoff potential, making the risks of agro-terrorism too large to ignore.
    Therefore, it is important to find solutions that guarantee trust and transparency
    within smart farming concept, as well as protect critical resources. 3) Cloud
    Computing Attacks Cloud is a very diverse, decentralized, heterogeneous and powerful
    ecosystem. The enormous amount of distributed resources make the cloud a hard
    target. However, with the introduction of new cloud concepts (e.g., on-demand
    services, auto-scaling, and self provisioning), attackers have used such resources
    in their favor and, in turn, cloud has become one of the most desirable targets
    to attacker. For example, with the introduction of auto-scaling in cloud, a large
    part of the virtual machines hosted on cloud are similarly configured. If one
    of the virtual machines is vulnerable, it is highly likely that all auto-scaled
    virtual machines are vulnerable as well. As such, a malware that infected one
    virtual machine can propagate to other virtual machines quickly. The infected
    machines can be employed as a part of global botnets which, consequently, can
    be used to launch a large scale distribute DoS (DDoS) attacks enough to hinder
    the functionality of cloud. For example, in 2018, a large scale DDoS attack was
    launched on github resulting in a record-breaking sudden traffic increase to 1.35
    terabits per second. Inevitably, DDoS attacks are becoming more frequent, more
    powerful and more sophisticated. A large scale DDoS attack with an overwhelming
    number of requests, packets or messages can deny services to smart farms, thereby
    paralyzing the brain of smart farms. Further, DDoS attacks might not be specifically
    targeting smart farms’ virtual machines. Even though, an attack might be directed
    at a different target, if virtual machines used by smart farms are on the save
    physical server, it will naturally block off other’s traffic as well. SECTION
    V. Existing Research Table 1 summarizes state-of-the-art research, challenges
    and contributions with respect to security and privacy issues in smart farming.
    We have categorized the literature into different subsections based on the focus
    areas they address. TABLE 1 Projects and Research Addressing Cybersecurity in
    Smart Farming A. Cyber Attacks, Threats and Proposed Solutions Researchers and
    federal agencies have started gauging the impact cyber-attacks as more and more
    farmers and communities are adopting technologies in the farms. The U.S. Department
    for Homeland Security released a report [12] which emphasizes the importance of
    precision agriculture (PA) and associated cybersecurity threat and potential vulnerabilities.
    The report highlights the confidentiality, integrity, and availability model of
    information security in farming. It defines different technologies involved in
    PA including in-farm devices, location and remote sensing technologies, machine
    learning, etc. It briefly discusses the impacted groups by the misuse of technologies
    in farming including farmers, livestock producers, and also industries that support
    or rely on agriculture. This report also discusses hypothetical threat scenarios
    on real life examples. Another promising work [76] highlights the vulnerabilities
    and risks due to introduction of technologies in the field of precision agriculture.
    This thesis work illustrates data collection and related empirical study, however
    falls short of security solutions in the domain. The work from Jahn [64] discuss
    implications of using smart devices in the agriculture sector. The authors make
    strong argument about how the lack of a cyber insurance framework is going to
    have a big impact on various agribusinesses. They also highlight the fact that
    a regulatory response is needed to protect the interests of farmers who adopt
    the use of smart devices. Barreto and Amaral [77] use empirical methodology based
    on the analysis of information and experiences collected in the Internet Security
    Alliance,31 the European Cyber Security Organization32 and the National Institute
    of Standards and Technology33 to highlight security challenges in smart farming.
    Some major threats discussed include security and privacy issues, social engineering,
    denial of service, cyber-espionage agroterrorism, ransomware etc. The research
    also highlights a security framework to enable farmers to better understand security
    implications. However, the paper is unable to discuss open research issues, and
    challenges to secure the environment without evidence of how the discussed attacks
    are orchestrated in the domain. Peer to Peer (P2P) is a network paradigm which
    has use cases in smart farming communication. The device authentication methods
    in this type of communication, however, rely heavily on public key infrastructure.
    Although the system is trustworthy, it puts unnecessary computation load on resource
    constrained smart farm IoT devices participating in a secure P2P communication.
    Accordingly, authors in [78] proposed a lightweight device authentication solution
    in which session keys and public keys are combined to expedite the encryption/decryption
    tasks. It results in a fast and light-weight authentication solution which is
    a good fit for smart farming communication purposes. Additionally, West [79] introduced
    a framework to understand vulnerabilities in emerging technologies and the use
    of such technologies in a smart-farming-specific environment. The framework goal
    is to quantify the degree to which the use of smart farming new technologies are
    vulnerable to cyber-attacks. It uses the common vulnerability scoring system (CVSS)
    for the threat prediction model assessment. The work shows the trade-offs between
    technology maturity and adaptation in the smart farming environment which can
    lead to system compromise. The approach in the paper uses three parameters: basic
    parameters, temporal parameters and environmental parameters for constructing
    a CVSS score. Basic parameters indicate the intrinsic and severity of a vulnerability,
    whereas temporal parameters indicate how a vulnerability might change and affect
    the system over time due to technical changes. Environmental parameters reflect
    the specifications of a vulnerability present in a smart-farming-specific environment.
    Although CVSS score has become a standard in the industry for understanding the
    severity of vulnerabilities and prioritizing their patches, it has some shortcomings.
    Smart farming is a diverse environment with many connected devices and systems.
    CVSS score deals with individual vulnerabilities and fails to accurately capture
    impact of connections within the entire system. B. Blockchain Related Research
    Recently, the usefulness of blockchain in domains other than cryptocurrency and
    financial transactions has been acknowledged [93]–[95]. Agriculture and food supply
    chain is one of the domains in which blockchain technology has shown its capabilities.
    Accordingly, the authors in [81] study overall implications, challenges and potential
    of existing blockchain-based projects in the field. Besides, it critically reviews
    maturity of such projects and elaborates on possible barriers and challenges,
    which hinder acceptability of such projects among farmers and existing cyber farming
    systems. Lin et al. [80] also focused on the use of blockchain technology for
    food safety. Authors created a system that tracks and monitors food production
    cycle, including the processes of raw materials, cultivation/breeding, processing,
    transporting, warehousing, and selling. The system also uses various IoT based
    sensors to replace manual recording and verification with sensor based verification.
    Other works [82], [84], [96] focused on providing case studies of using blockchain
    and smart contracts in smart farming. Awan et al. [82] proposed a framework based
    on IoT and blockchain technology for agriculture product tracking life cycle.
    They used smart contracts to eliminate the involvement of middlemen or third-party
    intermediaries and as such increase credibility and trust. The authors implemented
    a use case based on their proposed framework which included 120 IoT nodes and
    20 blockchain producers. Further, they validated their system based on it’s throughput
    considering different block sizes. However, this work has several drawbacks. Very
    few related works are included and comparison to other works in the literature
    is lacking. Additionally, the authors didn’t include much details about the nature
    of workload used in their experiments and they failed to add a baseline benchmark
    for the validation results for a fair comparison. Patil et al. [84] proposed a
    light-weight security framework for smart greenhouse farms based on blockchain.
    Every IoT node can elect cluster head leader which helps preventing a single point
    of failure in case an attacker targets the leader node. Additionally, the authors
    provided discussion of the security threats on their proposed framework following
    the traditional confidentiality, integrity and availability (CIA) triad model
    as well as their corresponding attacks. Although, this work is interesting, the
    framework is conceptual with no implementation or experiments. Further, the paper
    didn’t include related work nor a comparison to other proposed frameworks. Besides
    proposing blockchain-based frameworks and implementations [97], real world use
    cases of blockchain in smart farming are discussed in the blockchain research
    institute article [83]. In this work, authors explore applications of blockchain
    beyond the typical financial use cases in agriculture. Accordingly, they focused
    on three classes of applications: food safety, sustainable agriculture and the
    local economy and agriculture finance. The authors accompanied each class of applications
    with real world use cases. However, these use cases are discussed on a very high
    level aspect with no implementation details or results. C. AI and Machine Learning
    Assisted Work The advent of new age technologies such as artificial intelligence
    (AI) and machine learning (ML) not only facilitate the adaptation of advanced
    analytics in smart farming, but also create an ecosystem for improving the cybersecurity
    of services. Fusion of these technologies enable farmers to achieve higher average
    yield and better price control over their products in highly competitive markets.
    Design and implementation of a low cost IoT based security monitoring system have
    been proposed by Shabadi and Biradar [85]. The system focuses on physical layer
    of smart farming where it collects data from sensors. This data is sent to a controller
    where data is analyzed to make decisions like activating the actuators for water
    sprinkler in the farms. The proposed work is focused more on implementing the
    basic functionalities of smart farming than addressing security and privacy issues.
    It is very limited to simple threshold based decisions, like, if the soil temperature
    is above a certain threshold, then activate water sprinkler. Real time security
    monitoring for a remote farm is another current application of ML in smart farming.
    In scenarios where real time monitoring and notifications are paramount to farm
    and cybersecurity, the image(s) detected through a surveillance system can be
    processed by open-source computer vision programming supported by AI. For example,
    Abuan et al. [86] proposed a neural based face recognition system which is able
    to be invariant to changes in illumination for background and illumination conditions
    through a neural network training. The agricultural and farming industries have
    been widely influenced by the disruption of the IoT. However, the impact of the
    IoT is limited in countries with less penetration of mobile internet. The boom
    of low-power wide-area networks (LPWAN) in the last decade, with technologies
    such as LoRa or NB-IoT, has mitigated this by providing a relatively cheap infrastructure
    that enables low-power and long-range transmissions. Nonetheless, the benefits
    that LPWAN technologies have the disadvantage of low-bandwidth transmissions.
    Therefore, the integration of edge and fog computing, moving data analytics and
    compression near end devices, is key in order to extend functionality. By integrating
    AI at the local network layer, referred as edge AI, authors in [87] proposed a
    system architecture and implementation that expands the possibilities of smart
    agriculture and farming applications with edge and fog computing using LPWAN technology
    for large area coverage. In another research work [88], Support Vector Machines
    (SVM) along with Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are used to create an integration
    platform for big data analysis for smart farming. Such a platform not only expedites
    processing huge amounts of data collected from farms and livestocks, but also
    gives smart farming stakeholders the ability to detect and respond against possible
    cyber attacks more efficiently. D. Other Relevant Literature Chi et al. [89] present
    a framework for cybersecurity approaches in precision agriculture and discussed
    challenges of using Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) in digital virtual farms. They
    also present a framework for secure data capture. Security challenges in agrifood
    sector has been extensively discussed in [90]. The report provides an overview
    of emerging technologies in smart farming. Most smart farms are data-driven with
    respect to automating agriculture processes, decision making, and predictions.
    It also raises important questions of how important is data security? How risk
    assessment is done considering the entire supply chain? Who should take responsibility
    and who should be involved? The report serves to raise awareness addressing the
    importance of cybersecurity in agrifood sector. Authors in [98] provide an overview
    of cross-section of cybersecurity in food and agriculture sectors. They also discuss
    cyber-terrorism, policies, and plans. Spaulding and Wolf [99] detail the needs
    for educating farmers about various cybersecurity threats. Authors in [100] show
    the impact of cyber attacks on smart farming infrastructure via simulations using
    NETA with OMNET++ framework. Huning et al. [101] created a system to enable privacy
    preserving crowd sourcing techniques to estimate different smart farming parameters.
    Cybersecurity perception is also changing among farmers and agribusiness owners.
    Geil et al. [91] conducted an assessment of cybersecurity practices in the United
    States agriculture industry. Insights from their work reflect that over half of
    the respondents have been victims of a computer security incident, demonstrating
    that even individuals working in agriculture can be impacted by cybersecurity
    incidents. Cyberbiosecurity [92] is a multidisciplinary domain consists of cybersecurity,
    bio-security, and cyber-physical security. It discusses how current and emerging
    information technologies affect the cybersecurity of large portion of U.S. economy
    which is based on food and agriculture (i.e. Bio-economy). As Peccoud et al. [102]
    discuss, food and agricultural sectors are immensely diverse and require advanced
    technologies and efficiencies that rely on computer technologies, big data, cloud-based
    data storage, and internet accessibility, at the same time are vulnerable to cybersecurity
    incidents. Based on our literature review, it can be emphasised that, there is
    a dearth of security related research done in smart farming domain. There are
    numerous unanswered important security questions and open research challenges
    as discussed in the following section. SECTION VI. Open Challenges and Research
    Areas This section discusses open research challenges for improving security and
    privacy in smart farming ecosystem, as well illustrated in Figure 5. These open
    problems have been divided into four subsections as follows. FIGURE 5. Open research
    challenges and future directions for cybersecurity in smart farming. Show All
    A. Access Control, Trust & Privacy Perspective The multi-layered architecture
    discussed in section II recognizes possibilities of cyber threat challenges, which
    needs to be addressed by extending and adapting current access control foundational
    research, as well as developing sophisticated access control solutions to assist
    dynamic and agile environments in cyber-physical systems like smart farms. In-farm
    and cross farm operations need authorized interaction among sensors and labor/farmers
    working at multiple farms operating different sets of smart devices. What kind
    of operations they can do must be checked, which may require single level or multiple
    level access control depending on the risk factor associated with the operation?
    For example, consider sowing the field with autonomous tractor as compared to
    turning ON an irrigation system during the rainy season. Delegation and revocation
    of access rights to operate on a farm must be automatically performed based on
    the contract agreement, for example, in case temporary labor hired during harvesting
    season. Such access control requirements need further investigation to be adopted
    in such dynamic environment. The notion of trust can also be developed where labor
    who has worked earlier or an equipment borrowed from a ‘known’ old friend may
    have higher trust level as compared to machine and manpower hired from co-operative
    market. Self-configurable AI assisted smart access control policies need to be
    developed in a sharing-dominated CPS domain like smart farming. Cyber physical
    systems introduce the notion of virtual objects (which can be created in cloud
    or edge environment) corresponding to real physical sensors. An important challenge
    here is the location of cyber entities created as a part of connection with cloud
    or edge environments, for example, AWS device shadows34 or Microsoft Azure device
    twins.35 Research needs to determine: a) how cyber entity will move from one cloud
    (or edge) to another if the corresponding device is borrowed from one farmer to
    another? b) how the control of virtual entities will be delegated to the lending
    farmer, whether both the farmers need to use same application? c) how the applications
    will allow to delegate access for machine operation? d) Can the virtual objects
    or equipment across farms communicate with each other, whether at the physical
    level or using the virtual entities? If it is the virtual entity across different
    accounts in the same cloud provider, how such interaction will take place? In
    case it is across different cloud providers, how cross cloud and federated cloud
    environments will ensure such trust levels? Suppose in case a farmer has borrowed
    an equipment from a friend farmer, will the original owner be able to have access
    to it, or the access will be completely revoked? Is it possible to control a device
    through different remote clouds? All are relevant questions in smart farming domain.
    Further, how to establish trust mechanisms among different cloud service providers
    which the farmer is using for services and alerts? Manufacturer of the device
    may hold digital twin [103] and the cloud used by farmers will get data from on-field
    sensor and the cloud provider via pre-defined and signed negotiations. Such negotiations
    can also define what kind of data will be shared with required permissions of
    the owner farmer. Another important question is, how to establish trust between
    physical sensor objects? One approach is sensors at the same farm trust each other
    more for the shared information as compared to sensors across different farms.
    IoT and CPS specific cross cloud access controls and related security models are
    still in infancy stage and need more attention. Livestock and animals also have
    sensors embedded, which require appropriate authorized access. However, current
    literature does not provide strong access control mechanisms that can restrict
    such operations and secure critical data sharing from cattle and livestock at
    the farm. These wearable and health monitoring devices are attached to livestock
    and collect sensitive data, which can be used by adversaries to control the animal
    or even effect the sale/purchase of a cattle, for example, having the information
    about which cow is having low milk production. Efficient access controls [104]–[106]
    are needed to safeguard such sensitive data in cloud, which needs more research
    considering the spate of breaches heard every now and then. Usually in case of
    wearable IoT devices, a human which has the device controls what kind of data
    he/she wants to be shared. However, it is not in case of livestock which has a
    master (like the owner of the farm or caretaker) to decide control. Also, as a
    cattle is sold/purchased and moves from one owner to another, relevant data sharing
    security policies need to be specified and will require automatically configured
    information sharing. Studies [107], [108] have shown vulnerabilities in human
    used fitness devices, however, such studies and research are still an open challenge
    in case of livestock devices. Since data is collected from smart devices spread
    across farms, different applications require to access to this data. Consequentially,
    it is important to limit the sharing of data across applications and across nearby
    friend farmers, who may also get some value or receive alerts for their farms.
    How and when to share such information requires adaptive security policies to
    control and supervise data transferred by sensors to the cloud platform. Further,
    if data is sharing across multi cloud systems, cross cloud trust also needs to
    be addressed. Appropriate attribute based fine grained access controls [109],
    [110] and privacy preserving schemes need to be deployed to ensure confidentiality
    of the data. Evidently, farmers must decide the level and type of data sharing
    needed to ensure the privacy of critical information. B. Data Perspective The
    most noticeable feature of smart farming is its communication ability between
    the smart devices, resulting in an unprecedented amount of generated data [7],
    [111]. This provides many challenges as discussed in section III and open doors
    for several research opportunities. Machine learning is an attractive solution
    for processing big data, and implementing effective security solutions. Insider
    data leakage detection has always been a daunting task as users already have legitimate
    access to the system, making it hard to detect and predict such attacks. Several
    research works have been conducted on insider data leakage [22], [112], [113];
    however, none has been targeting smart farming settings. Further investigation
    is needed to understand the possibility of adopting insider data leakage defense
    mechanisms into smart farming and whether unique characteristics of smart farming
    can help to improve these mechanisms. Smart farms are highly connected systems,
    which allow malware to easily propagate through the network infecting all interconnected
    devices. An interesting question is how to detect malware in smart farming IoT
    environment, especially considering all heterogeneous devices in place. For instance,
    a malware detection technique that works against a malware that infects smart
    farming equipment might not work against malware that infects edge or cloud systems
    since the malware’s end goal is different. Many AI assisted malware detection
    techniques [114]–[120] are proposed and used in practice; however, there are no
    smart-farming-specific malware detection techniques that consider the context
    and environment in which smart farms reside. Smart farms generate diverse and
    vast amount of unstructured data. It is almost impossible for one party to analyze
    and make use of the entire datasets. For this reason, threat information sharing
    is a viable approach for data security. For instance, each smart farm can employ
    a malware detection technique; however, it is guaranteed that none of these employed
    techniques is comprehensive enough to catch all types of malware. Information
    sharing between smart farms can prove very useful. It can be used as an asset
    to share threat information about attack patterns or malware that was detected
    by collaborating smart farms. In a similar case, if a deployed detection technique
    in a farm detected supplied water with high toxin content, it is relevant to share
    that information with nearby farms who may also be impacted by similar issue.
    This can save analysis cost and money for every participating smart farm as it
    prevents doing work that someone else already did before. What kind of data, meta-data
    or analysis can be shared remains an open question and what kind of threat information
    sharing process can be used remain an open question for resource constrained farmers.
    Smart farming is an emerging field, so it is highly likely to encounter zero-day
    attacks which have not been detected before. Anomaly detection [121]–[125] is
    a very appealing solution against such attacks. Anomaly detection techniques look
    for any abnormal behavior that deviates from the pre-established database of normal
    behavior. These normal behaviour profiles are constructed based on collection
    of historical observations and patterns. Building smart farms behavior profiles
    is a challenging task since their behaviors are so dynamic in nature. External
    factors are a major reason for this dynamism. For example, less irrigation is
    needed during a rainy weather than dry weather which will cause a different behavior
    for irrigation systems. Can weather forecast information be used as an indication
    of such change of behavior? What kind of data contribute to building smart farms
    behavior profiles? Do some data fields weigh more than others? These are all open
    research questions that need to be investigated. Detection mechanisms are used
    to detect faulty and compromised sensors by monitoring the data sent for any tampered
    or abnormal values. Employing a simple threshold based mechanism can easily be
    bypassed by an attacker, so in most cases, more sophisticated machine learning
    based mechanisms need to be deployed. However, smart attackers can still bypass
    these models by (1) exploiting the sensors and a little tweaking of data sent
    by these sensors just to lead the machine learning model in place to misclassify/mispredict
    the outcome (such attack is called adversarial machine learning attack), and (2)
    poisoning the model during training phase by injecting bad data into the model’s
    training database, and in turn get it to learn something it shouldn’t. Some research
    addressed mitigation against adversarial attacks; however, it is not clear whether
    these technologies can be adopted to smart farming domain which is very dominant
    on changing environment conditions. Another open research challenge is to create
    various artificial intelligence systems that collect and parse Cyber Threat Intelligence
    (CTI36) about smart devices, software, cloud systems etc. used in the smart farming
    ecosystem. These systems have been developed to collect CTI in other areas [126]–[129]
    and need to be extended to ensure coverage of various smart farming devices, equipment
    and software. C. Network Perspective Cybersecurity threats to smart farming and
    its devices include a diverse range of security risks due to certain characteristics
    of the underlying networking and communication technologies which are used in
    the domain. First, both virtual and physical communication environments get connected.
    Many IoT devices in a smart farm system are capable of functioning on the data
    they receive from their respective environments which shortens the distance between
    virtual and physical systems. While convenient for the users, it allows cyber
    threats to convert to physical consequences more quickly, thereby having a bigger
    impact. Second, devices and layers involved in a smart farm system create a complex
    communication environment. Hyper connected farming environments exist due to the
    growing availability and diversity of IoT devices. ‘Complex’ in this context means
    that large number of devices are working in a single smart farm environment such
    that dynamic interactions between them are possible. This complexity expands the
    capabilities of an environment, but at the cost of a wider attack surface. Smart
    farming like other emerging technologies is embracing new networking paradigms
    to tackle today’s sophisticated attacks. Software defined network (SDN) [130]–[132]
    is one such promising networking revolution. Through decoupling control plane
    from data plane and giving credit to network programmable, it offers interesting
    technical capabilities to network providers. This causes an intense adaption of
    SDN in almost every fields of networking, from data center networks to WANs, wireless,
    5G and recently IoT. Using SDN in smart farm networking is attracting to both
    academia and industry for certain reasons. SDN supports both physical and virtual
    networking scenarios very well. It also offers a reliable way of practicing networking
    in highly diverse and naturally heterogeneous smart farms networking environment.
    Moreover, using SDN, smart farms are able to form a holistic view of all the connected
    devices along with how they interact in a near real time manner. Such a holistic
    view not only improves agility, scalability, and manageability of smart farm networking
    but also empowers a large smart farm network to enforce robust security counter
    measure against possible sophisticated cyber attacks. It is important to research
    further the adaptability of SDN and other 5G related next generation communication
    technologies in smart farming and precision agriculture domain. SDN can enable
    smart farms to get the most benefit out of complex machine learning and AI algorithms
    to automate network management of large number of sensors, wireless and wired
    networks used in a smart farming ecosystem. It also facilitates implementing advanced,
    cross-layer network security solutions which are very time and resource consuming,
    if not impossible, otherwise. Finally, SDN expedites edge networking and hence
    cloud-based security-as-a-service delivery model becomes a more approachable solution
    in large smart farming deployments. D. Compliance and Supply Chain Perspective
    With the ubiquitous use of sensors, automated drones, blockchain, artificial intelligence
    integration, different agricultural businesses are falling back on compliance,
    regulation and cyber insurance to protect themselves [64]. With the development
    of targeted malware and other cyber threats, the entire food supply chain is at
    risk [12], [64]. A hostile actor specifically interested in disrupting the supply
    chain can target various organizations and companies that supply raw material
    to farms or process food for the end user. A potential solution to this problem
    is to develop industry standards that enable trust between various raw material
    suppliers and downstream food processors [64]. The development of these standards
    enforced by national governments through regulation, has been slow. One example
    of such a shortcoming, is the existence of a few cybersecurity standards for the
    many smart devices used in the food supply chain. Various legislation are being
    introduced to set ‘minimal cybersecurity operational standards for internet connected
    devices’. In specific cases where various governments do not wish to regulate
    these interactions, it is up to various agriculture businesses to protect themselves
    by asking their supply chain to ‘self-regulate’ cybersecurity best practices [64].
    Such developments can be pushed through market demands, competitive pressure,
    etc. The food supply chain also lacks robust cyber insurance policies. With the
    constant development of smart applications, AI, smart farming equipment, etc.
    cyber insurance providers are unable to predict and quantify various cyber risks
    involved in these systems. Specific research needs to be done so as to develop
    standard legal jargon and metrics to quantify cyber risk in smart farming. These
    will help create robust cyber insurance markets for precision agriculture. Various
    systems [133]–[136] also need to be built to make it easier for the end users
    to understand and parse these complex legal documents, cyber insurance policies,
    agreements, contracts, etc. Research on these open challenges will help wide adoption
    of precision agriculture technologies. SECTION VII. Conclusion The proliferation
    of smart devices with communication and sensing capabilities have unleashed plethora
    of user services, and at the same time made tasks more convenient and efficient
    for humans. However, wide adoption of such internet connected devices and data
    driven applications across various domains have raised security and privacy issues,
    making these systems vulnerable to cyber-attacks. This paper discusses such cybersecurity
    challenges in smart farming and elaborates open research questions. The paper
    first outlines a multi-layer smart farming architecture illustrating different
    entities pertinent to real time use-cases supported by edge and cloud environments.
    Based on the architecture, the paper outlines security and privacy issues and
    highlights different attacks scenarios in smart farms as well as scenarios affecting
    the entire food supply chain. Thereafter, this article surveys the state-of-the-art
    research and acknowledges important works related to cybersecurity in the domain.
    Finally, the paper illustrates several open challenges and research problems pertinent
    to security and privacy aspects in precision agriculture. We envision this paper
    will simulate research to solve platitude of security and data privacy issues
    in fast growing and economically important smart farming sector. ACKNOWLEDGMENT

    \ reliance on technology, customers have legitimate \nconcerns about privacy and\
    \ data security. The collection and storage of \npersonal information raise worries\
    \ about data breaches, identity theft, \nand misuse of sensitive data. Customers\
    \ may hesitate to share personal \ninformation or engage with businesses if they\
    \ do not trust their data will \nbe handled securely. \n3 \nDependence on \nTechnology\

    \ rates and job security within communities. Customers may \nhave concerns about\
    \ the broader societal implications of technology-\nbased value creation. \n \n\
    Thus, technology-based value creation in business organizations brings about constraints\
    \ for \ncustomers, including digital exclusion, privacy concerns, technical issues,\

    \ heavily on technology-driven processes. \n7 \nImpact on \nWorkforce and \nJob\
    \ \nDisplacement \nThe adoption of technology-driven solutions can result in workforce\
    \ \nchanges and job displacement. Automation and artificial intelligence \nmay\
    \ replace certain job roles, leading to workforce restructuring or \nreskilling\
    \ requirements. Organizations must navigate the ethical and \nsocial implications\
    \ of technology adoption, including managing the \nimpact on employees and addressing\
    \ potential job displacement \nconcerns. \n8 \nIntegration \nChallenges and \n\
    Interoperability \nIntegrating new technologies into existing systems and processes\
    \ can \nbe complex. Organizations may face challenges in achieving seamless \n\
    integration and interoperability between different technology platforms \nand\
    \ legacy systems. Lack of compatibility and integration can hinder \nthe realization\
    \ of the full benefits of technology-based value creation \nand result in inefficiencies.\
    \ \n9 \nData Privacy and \nCompliance \nRegulations \nOrganizations must navigate\
    \ increasingly stringent data privacy and \ncompliance regulations. Collecting,\
    \ storing, and processing customer \ndata must comply with relevant laws and regulations,\
    \ such as the \nGeneral Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or the California \n\
    Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Ensuring compliance requires \ndedicated resources,\
    \ expertise, and ongoing monitoring to avoid legal \nand reputational consequences.\

    \ value creation may reduce human interaction and \npersonalized customer relationships.\
    \ Automation and self-service \noptions can limit opportunities for direct customer\
    \ engagement and \npersonalized experiences. Organizations must strike a balance\
    \ between \nleveraging technology for efficiency and maintaining human \ntouchpoints\
    \ to build strong customer relationships. \n \nThus, technology-based value creation\

    \ based Value Creation in Business Organizations from \nCustomers Point of view:\
    \  \nWhile technology-based value creation in business organizations offers numerous\
    \ advantages, there \nare also some disadvantages from a customer's point of view.\
    \ Some of the prominent disadvantages \nare listed in Table 17.  \n \nTable 17:\
    \ Disadvantages of technology based value creation from Customers’ point of view\
    \ \nS. \nNo. \nKey Issue \nExplanation \n1 \nLack of Personal \nInteraction \n\
    Technology-driven solutions often lack the personal touch and human \ninteraction\
    \ that customers value. Automated processes, self-checkouts, \nand chatbots may\
    \ replace face-to-face interactions with employees, \nleading to a sense of impersonality.\
    \ Some customers may prefer the \nwarmth and personal attention that comes from\
    \ direct human \ninteraction. \n2 \nTechnical Issues \nand Dependence \nCustomers\
    \ may encounter technical issues when relying on technology-\nbased value creation.\
    \ System failures, website crashes, or connectivity \nproblems can disrupt the\
    \ customer experience and lead to frustration. \nMoreover, customers become increasingly\
    \ dependent on technology \nand may feel helpless or inconvenienced when it fails.\
    \ \n3 \nPrivacy and Data \nSecurity \nConcerns \nCustomers may have concerns about\
    \ their privacy and the security of \ntheir personal information when engaging\
    \ with technology-driven \nsolutions. Sharing personal data online raises worries\
    \ about data \nbreaches, unauthorized access, or misuse of information. Customers\
    \ \nmay be hesitant to provide their data or engage with businesses they \nperceive\
    \ as not adequately protecting their privacy. \n4 \nInformation \nOverload and\
    \ \nDecision Fatigue \nThe vast amount of information available through technology\
    \ can \noverwhelm customers. With numerous options, reviews, and \nrecommendations,\
    \ customers may struggle to make confident \ndecisions. The abundance of choices\
    \ and information can lead to \ndecision fatigue, making it challenging for customers\
    \ to choose the best \nproduct or service that aligns with their preferences.\
    \ \n5 \nLack of Control \nand Autonomy \nTechnology-driven solutions may limit\
    \ customer control and autonomy \nin certain situations. For example, self-checkout\
    \ systems in retail stores \neliminate the interaction with a cashier but also\
    \ remove the ability to \nask questions or receive immediate assistance. Some\
    \ customers may \nprefer having more control and the ability to interact with\
    \ \nknowledgeable staff. \n6 \nDigital \nExclusion and \nAccessibility \nBarriers\
    \ \nNot all customers have equal access to technology or possess the digital \n\
    skills necessary to fully engage with technology-driven solutions. \nDigital exclusion\
    \ can result from limited internet connectivity, lack of \naccess to devices,\
    \ or insufficient technological literacy. This creates \nbarriers for customers,\
    \ limiting their ability to benefit from technology-\nbased value creation. \n\
    7 \nStandardization \nand Lack of \nUniqueness \nTechnology-driven \nsolutions\
    \ \noften \nprioritize \nefficiency \nand \nstandardization, which may lead to\
    \ a lack of uniqueness in the customer \nexperience. Automated processes and templates\
    \ can make interactions \nwith businesses feel impersonal and generic. Customers\
    \ may long for \npersonalized experiences and a sense of individuality that may\
    \ be \ndiminished by technology-driven standardization. \nInternational Journal\
    \ of Applied Engineering and Management \nLetters (IJAEML), ISSN: 2581-7000, Vol.\

    \ www.srinivaspublication.com \nPAGE 272 \n \n \n \n8 \nSocial \nDisconnect and\
    \ \nIsolation \nRelying heavily on technology can contribute to social disconnect\
    \ and \nfeelings of isolation among customers. Increased screen time and \nvirtual\
    \ interactions may replace face-to-face human connections, \nimpacting social\
    \ well-being. Some customers may crave authentic, in-\nperson experiences and\
    \ genuine social interactions that technology \ncannot fully replicate. \n9 \n\
    Learning Curve \nand \nTechnological \nBarriers \nCustomers may encounter challenges\
    \ in adapting to new technologies \nand platforms. User interfaces, complex features,\
    \ or unfamiliar \nprocesses can create a learning curve. Technological barriers\
    \ can limit \naccess and create frustrations, particularly for customers who are\
    \ less \ntech-savvy or have limited exposure to digital tools. \n10 \nInequality\
    \ and \nSocioeconomic \nDivides \nTechnology-based \nvalue \ncreation \ncan \n\
    exacerbate \nexisting \nsocioeconomic divides. Customers with limited access to\
    \ technology or \ndigital skills may be left behind, unable to fully benefit from\
    \ the \nconvenience and opportunities provided by technology. This can \nperpetuate\
    \ inequalities and create a digital divide between different \ncustomer segments.\
    \ \n \nThus, technology-based value creation in business organizations brings\
    \ about disadvantages for \ncustomers, including a lack of personal interaction,\
    \ technical issues, privacy concerns, information \noverload, limited control,\
    \ digital exclusion, standardization, social disconnect, learning barriers, and\
    \ \nsocioeconomic divides. Recognizing and addressing these disadvantages is important\
    \ for businesses \nto ensure inclusive and customer-centric approaches to technology\
    \ implementation. \n \n8.8 Disadvantages of Technology based Value creation in\
    \ Business Organizations from \nOrganizations Point of view: \nWhile technology-based\
    \ value creation in business organizations offers numerous benefits, there are\
    \ \nalso some disadvantages from an organizational point of view. Some of the\
    \ prominent disadvantages \nare listed in Table 18.  \n \nTable 18: Disadvantages\
    \ of technology based value creation from Organizational point of view \nS. \n\
    No. \nKey Issue \nExplanation \n1 \nHigh Initial \nInvestment Costs \nImplementing\
    \ technology-driven solutions often requires a significant \nupfront investment.\
    \ Businesses need to invest in hardware, software, \ninfrastructure upgrades,\
    \ and employee training. The costs associated \nwith acquiring and implementing\
    \ technology can strain the \norganization's budget, particularly for small or\
    \ resource-constrained \nbusinesses. \n2 \nComplexity and \nIntegration \nChallenges\
    \ \nAdopting new technologies can be complex and challenging for \norganizations.\
    \ Integration with existing systems and processes can be a \ntime-consuming and\
    \ complicated task. The need to reconfigure \nworkflows and align technology with\
    \ business objectives may disrupt \noperations and require significant effort\
    \ to ensure seamless integration. \n3 \nDependency on \nTechnology and \nVulnerability\
    \ \nOverreliance on technology can create vulnerability for organizations. \n\
    Technical failures, cyber-attacks, or system outages can bring \noperations to\
    \ a halt, resulting in financial losses and reputational \ndamage. Organizations\
    \ need contingency plans and backup systems to \nmitigate risks and minimize disruptions\
    \ caused by technology failures. \n4 \nSkills Gap and \nWorkforce \nReskilling\
    \ \nTechnology-driven solutions often require specialized skills and \nexpertise.\
    \ Organizations may face challenges in finding employees with \nthe necessary\
    \ technical knowledge or may need to invest in reskilling \nexisting employees.\
    \ Bridging the skills gap can be time-consuming and \ncostly, especially if the\
    \ technology landscape rapidly evolves. \nInternational Journal of Applied Engineering\

    \ \nPAGE 273 \n \n \n \n5 \nData Privacy and \nSecurity Risks \nThe collection,\
    \ storage, and processing of customer data present \nsignificant privacy and security\
    \ risks. Organizations must invest in \nrobust cybersecurity measures and comply\
    \ with data protection \nregulations to protect sensitive information. Failure\
    \ to safeguard \ncustomer data can result in legal liabilities, financial penalties,\
    \ and \nreputational damage. \n6 \nResistance to \nChange and \nEmployee \nMorale\
    \ \nIntroducing technology-based solutions may face resistance from \nemployees\
    \ who fear job displacement or feel overwhelmed by new \ntechnologies. Resistance\
    \ to change can impact employee morale, job \nsatisfaction, and productivity.\
    \ Organizations need to manage change \neffectively, provide adequate training\
    \ and support, and communicate \nthe benefits of technology adoption to gain employee\
    \ buy-in. \n7 \nSystem \nComplexity and \nMaintenance \nAdopting technology-driven\
    \ solutions often leads to increased system \ncomplexity. Multiple software applications,\
    \ integrations, and \ndependencies can make it challenging to manage and maintain\
    \ the \ntechnology infrastructure. Regular updates, troubleshooting, and \ntechnical\
    \ support are necessary to ensure smooth operations, which can \nstrain IT resources\
    \ and budgets. \n8 \nOveremphasis on \nEfficiency over \nHuman \nInteraction \n\
    Technology-driven solutions may prioritize efficiency and automation, \npotentially\
    \ diminishing the importance of human interaction. \nCustomers may feel disconnected\
    \ or frustrated when they cannot access \npersonalized assistance or when their\
    \ interactions are solely with \nautomated systems. This can impact customer satisfaction\
    \ and loyalty. \n9 \nRapid \nTechnological \nObsolescence \nTechnology evolves\
    \ at a rapid pace, making investments in technology \nsusceptible to obsolescence.\
    \ Businesses must continually monitor and \nassess emerging technologies to remain\
    \ competitive. Outdated \ntechnology can become a hindrance, requiring additional\
    \ investments \nto upgrade or replace systems. \n10 \nEthical \nConsiderations\
    \ \nand Social \nImpact \nTechnology-based value creation can raise ethical considerations\
    \ and \nimpact society at large. Organizations must navigate the potential \n\
    consequences of their technological choices, such as the impact on \nemployment,\
    \ privacy, and social equity. Failing to address these ethical \nconsiderations\
    \ can lead to backlash from customers, employees, and the \npublic. \n \nThus,\
    \ technology-based value creation in business organizations brings about disadvantages\
    \ from an \norganizational point of view, including high initial investment costs,\
    \ complexity and integration \nchallenges, dependency and vulnerability, skills\
    \ gap, data privacy and security risks, resistance to \nchange, system complexity\
    \ and maintenance, overemphasis on efficiency, rapid technological \nobsolescence,\
    \ and ethical considerations [298]. Understanding and effectively managing these\
    \ \ndisadvantages is crucial for organizations to maximize the benefits of technology\
    \ and mitigate \npotential drawbacks [299]. \n9. CONCLUSION :   \nThe role of\
    \ twelve ICCT Underlying Technologies including AI, Blockchain, Business intelligence,\
    \ \nCloud computing, Cyber security, 3D printing, IoT, Quantum computing, Mobile\
    \ marketing, \nInformation storage technology, Ubiquitous education technology,\
    \ and VR & AR for Business Value \nCreation like Innovation and Differentiation,\
    \ Customer focus, Operational efficiency, Strategic \nPartnerships and Alliances,\
    \ Talent Management, Effective Marketing and Branding, Financial \nPerformance\
    \ and Growth, Sustainability and Corporate Social Responsibility, and Adaptability\
    \ and \nAgility are discussed. The advantages, benefits, constraints, and disadvantages\
    \ of Technologies based \nValue creation from various stakeholders’ point of view\
    \ are analysed. The impact of ICCT underlying \ntechnologies on business value\
    \ creation in organizations are also determined using relevant \ninformation collection\
    \ & evaluation. New knowledge and interpretation are presented on how to create\
    \ \nbusiness value for long time sustainability by organizations in every industry.\

    Location: Madurai, India SECTION I. Introduction Usage of IoT is increasing rapidly
    and it provides many opportunities to enhance the quality of life and lesson the
    human intervention. It helps in taking better and intelligent decisions. Application
    of IoT is in various domains like smart homes, smart irrigation, smart industries,
    smart grid and in many more areas. It works as a human helping hand to lessen
    the burden on humans and acts as a guide to take more better and smart decisions
    [1]. With the development of information technology, low-cost information devices
    have reached households of millions, and the number of devices connected to the
    Internet is increasing geometrically [2]. In IoT, every device is having its own
    identity, but it is very difficult to identify the particular device among billion
    of devices. Through the sensors, they can sense the environment generate an enormous
    amount of data which is monitored and further processed to get valuable information
    from it. The basic component of the IoT environment are sensors, actuators, software,
    and network [3]. The main goal of creating IoT devices is to make human life easier
    and more comfortable but most of the devices are not designed to face security
    and privacy issues and thus, face major challenges related to security and privacy
    concerns like integrity, confidentiality, authentication, etc. [4]. Self-configuring
    and dynamic behavior are the characteristics of the IoT devices. Along with the
    advantages it has various security and privacy issues as well because of the nature
    of the IoT devices. The major problem in IoT is because of the heterogeneous nature
    of the devices. Every device needs a different kind of security [5]. IoT systems
    are quite complex so the data will go through different types of entities along
    the way, which makes securing IoT applications particularly challenging. Basically,
    it is required to consider the security across different stages. For example-
    It is required to consider secure hardware which will run a secure OS by loading
    a trusted firmware into the smart devices which will be able to establish a secure
    communication channel with the cloud backend. On the cloud side we need to host
    a number of security-related services to ensure the confidentiality, data-integrity
    and availability based on those security services. Sensors and the nodes are exposed
    to the environment and because of resource constrained they are more vulnerable
    to various kinds of attacks. Threats represents the exploit potential of a scenario.
    Every threat has a threat actor, this could be human, or it could be anything.
    The fundamental of information assurance is confidentiality, keeping data secure
    from eavesdropping there are many tools that can be used to enable confidentiality
    of our data but one of the primary tools is cryptography. Integrity protection
    is another critical aspect of information assurance, for this issue another tool
    that is hash algorithm can be used. For ensuring authentication digital signature
    can be used. Non- repudiation is another security service, it requires both technical
    and procedural controls and can result in an entity not being able to later deny
    an action that entity performed. Availability ensures that information is available
    when needed. The threat is based on a vulnerability that can be exploited given
    an identified vulnerability, the threat actor will plan and execute an attack
    against the system If successful this will result in the compromise of that system,
    events do not stop here however, oftentimes once an attacker gains access to a
    system they can pivot to lateral or higher value systems within an enterprise.
    In this paper section 2 presents the architecture of the IoT, about the layers
    and the security concerns related to the layers. In next section Blockchain is
    explained and how it emerged as a solution to the IoT security along with some
    limitations of the blockchain is presented. In section 4, open issues and future
    scope is defined and in the last section conclusion is derived about the paper.
    SECTION II. Architecture of IoT with Security and Privacy Concern There are basically
    three layers in the architecture of IoT that is defined below in detail. Perception
    layer, Network layer and the Application layer. Perception layer is lower most
    layer having components like sensors, RFID etc. that is having the ability to
    sense the environment. The data coming from the sensors are pass on to the next
    layer that will aggregate the data. In the processing layer, it processes the
    data and make it valuable. Finally, the application layer deals with the decision
    making and provides the back- end services. IoT is capable enough to solve various
    problems in different fields but it also faces so many issues in terms of privacy
    and security issues. This section briefly describes about the layers of the architecture
    of IoT along with the possible issues related to each layer. A. Perception Layer
    It is the external or the lower most layer that comprises the sensors that senses
    the environment and gathers the information of the surroundings. It is also known
    as the device layer. The sensors used to sense everything. According to the application
    the corresponding sensors are used and devices like RFID, 2-D barcode, actuators
    etc. are used. Information such as about the weather, air, environment changes,
    about the location. These types of information are recorded by the sensors. The
    security concern in this layer is as the sensors can be easily replaceable by
    the attackers. Thus, raise to security threats like- node capture, Replay Attack,
    Eavesdropping [6]. Other attacks like DoS, Brute force attack, hardware jamming
    [7]. Security mechanisms like sensor data protection or encryption can be used.
    Security and Privacy issues happened in this layer is represented in the table
    I. Node Capture It is one among the serious attack by which attacker can perform
    many types of attacks on the network. The attacker can easily capture the whole
    network and can gets the access of the entire network. It can lead to the security
    breaches and the privacy of the communicating parties The universe is immense
    and it seems to be homogeneous, in a large scale, everywhere we look at. is compromised.
    Communication between the sender and receiver can also be listen by the attacker
    [8]. Thus, it is a very serious hazards in the perception layer. Fig. 1. Architecture
    of IoT with challenges Show All Replay Attack Replay attack is the attack that
    is possible in the perception layer. It is the attack in which an attacker captures
    the network and starts communicating as the authorized user to the authorized
    destination. To prevent this kind of attack sequence number or timestamps can
    be used. It helps in authenticating the user [9]. User having packets of appropriate
    timestamp is only allowed and if the timestamp is beyond the certain limit, then
    that packet will be discarded immediately. Eavesdropping When the unauthorized
    person listens to the communication that is happening between the sender and the
    receiver without the knowledge of these users. It can be of two types active and
    passive. In case of passive eavesdropping the attacker just listens to the communication
    but will not make any changes into that message. But, in case of active one the
    intruder can make changes in the message. Denial of Service In case of this attack,
    it will cause chaos or disruption into the network. DoS attempts to prevent a
    website or some web service from operating normally by overwhelming it with requests.
    Intruder or unauthorized person bombarded the network with false requests as a
    result when the authorized user wants to access the resource the server deny that
    request as it is already down thus not capable enough to handle the additional
    requests [7]. Security and Privacy issues happened in this layer is represented
    in the table I. Table I Security and privacy issues in perception layer B. Network
    Layer This layer is a bridge between the internet and IoT devices. It is the external
    hardware like Wi-Fi, ZigBee, etc. [9]. It helps in transferring and processing
    the data that comes from one layer and transmitted to next layer. This layer commonly
    known as the transmission layer and works as a bridge between the layers. It mainly
    transmits the data that it collected from the perception layer through the sensing
    devices. It is very much sensitive and have some security issues like authentication,
    integrity and others. Security and Privacy issues happened in this layer is represented
    in the table II. Table II Security and privacy issues in network layer C. Application
    Layer Application layer is the topmost layer in the IoT architecture, work of
    this layer is to mainly deals with making the decision and also it provides the
    back-end services. It allows the monitoring of user''s data as well. The application
    of the IoT is defined by this layer. It also defines about the devices or system
    in which IoT has deployed. Security and Privacy issues happened in this layer
    is represented in the table III. Table III Security and privacy issues in application
    layer D. Other Challenges in IoT Major issues faced by the IoT are discussed above
    related to security. Apart from the discussed issues other challenges faced by
    the IoT are related to regulatory issues, economic issues, interoperability, scalability,
    developmental issues are also there [14]. There are Other challenges are big data
    generation, architectural dependencies, robustness, scalability and many more.
    1) Robustness Robustness is mainly the ability to cope up with the execution errors.
    It is the smooth flow of work despite having irregularity in the calculations
    or in the input. In IoT devices it is important to know about the location and
    about their interaction with other devices based on certain parameters like power
    levels of the communication, schedules of waking up and sleeping. 2) Scalability
    Scalability is one of the challenges in the IoT environments as devices are growing
    at faster rate. So, to provide proper storage facility, proving authentications
    are the big issues. The devices are battery operated and some require their own
    source for energy. Data collection and storage and use can affect the scale of
    the IoT. 3) Generation of Big Data Sensors of the IoT devices are collecting enormous
    amount of data continuously from the environment. So, there is a need of the hour
    to build a plan of action to convert these data into useful information. 4) Absence
    of Common Standard As there are many levels of IoT devices and IoT manufacturing
    industries. Therefore, it is a great challenge to distinguish between approved
    and offline devices connected to the Internet [15]. SECTION III. Blockchain as
    a Solution for IoT A. Blockchain Blockchain are becoming more in demand these
    days. It is nothing but the block of chains. Each block contains a number of transactions,
    which record status of certain events. This approach initially defined by the
    researcher''s group and was originally intended to timestamp digital documents.
    This will make the tampering difficult and also impossible to backdate them. They
    have some interesting property like once some data have been recorded inside blockchain,
    it becomes very difficult to change it [16]. The data that is being stored inside
    the block depends on hash and hash of the previous block. The block and the content
    inside the block are identified by the hash and it is always unique like our fingerprint.
    The hash has been calculated at the time of block creation. So, hash gets changed
    as the data changes. So, hash is very useful if we want to detect the changes
    to blocks. Hash of previous block effectively creates a chain of blocks and it''s
    this technique that makes a Blockchain so secure. Blockchain provides a number
    of salient properties like decentralization, which means blockchain is run by
    a committee of nodes in a peer-to-peer manner. Another is immutability, blockchain
    uses cryptographic hash functions to link all of the blocks together to ensure
    data is immutable. Next is transparency, blockchain provides a fully auditable
    and valid ledger of transactions [17]. The fourth property is security and resilience,
    each blockchain node or entity is associated with a pair of private or public
    keys. Fifth one is automation- blockchain enables users to build streamlined applications
    to deal with complex business processes that involve multiple intermediaries using
    a more powerful concept that is smart contract. B. Blockchain with IoT IoT can
    make use of blockchain to secure the IoT system. This integration can be used
    to make policies and can monitor the actions using smart contracts. Integration
    of blockchain with IoT will give valuable results. Blockchain enhances the IoT
    by providing trusted sharing services, the information is traceable. When Blockchain
    is used, the source of the data can be identifiable and thus, security can be
    enhanced. Therefore, Blockchain acts a remedy for securing the IoT and make it
    more reliable. It is also proved that the blockchain is identified as a key to
    the problems related to scalability, reliability and privacy concerns in the IoT
    paradigm. As there are so many salient features of blockchain, if we integrate
    blockchain with IoT then using the decentralization features, it will eliminate
    the single point failures efficiently [18]. Immutability ensures data integrity
    in the system, by using the transparency property, the status of the connected
    devices and the associated physical assets are tracked. Security and resilience
    enable to authenticate users and devices efficiently. Using smart contracts, a
    trust can be built among the different IoT processes and eventually eliminate
    trusted intermediaries and reduce system costs. With blockchain technology and
    smart contracts a trusted IoT systems can be build that can be used to power a
    wide range of IoT applications across different industry sectors. Blockchain can
    be used a remedy for security and privacy issues of IoT as it eliminates the concept
    of central server system of IoT and also it provides to flow the data using the
    distributed ledger of blockchain. As in IoT, a centralized server is responsible
    for collecting, maintaining and for the flow of data. If devices want to access
    the data, then then this central server plays an important role. Thus, there is
    a huge concern that IoT suffers from that is single point failure. To solve this
    issue, Blockchain is capable as to eliminate the central server a decentralized
    network, distributed file system is required [19]. Blockchain helps in enhancing
    the privacy of IoT devices and thus will help in building a robust system. It
    also makes device coordination easy. In Blockchain distributed ledger allows proper
    authentication of data and helps in making accurate interpretation. Blockchain
    with IoT makes the IoT system more secure and more reliable. C. Blockchain Challenges
    There are some issues that arises while we adopt Blockchain with IoT. Blockchain
    integration with IoT can help in many aspects like it can solve the privacy issues
    and also increases the reliability but this technology is also having some limitations
    which can affect the performance. The challenges arise due to the limitation such
    as the lack of skilled person, lack of proper legal issues, lack of storage facility,
    variation in computing capabilities, limited developments in technology, computing
    capabilities, processing time and scalability issues [20]. This integration is
    significant but the nature of both the technology is quite dissimilar. Blockchain
    is designed to work with powerful computers and the reality of IoT is different.
    Some challenges arise due to this integration is Storage capabilities, the scalability
    of blockchain is still having some issues and thus, appears to be not suitable
    for the applications of the IoT. IoT devices generate huge amount of data but
    current blockchain can able to process only few transactions in one second so
    this is a major challenge for the IoT. Other issues with Blockchain are related
    to some legal issues like the laws dealing with the information handling and privacy
    concerns that has to be tackled in the IoT. There are so many advantages of using
    blockchain with the IoT but if we used it carefully and with proper caution then
    only it will become an advantage for securing the IoT. Blockchain can revolutionize
    the IoT as it can help to improve the applications of the IoT. Integration of
    blockchain with IoT solves so many issues that are faced by the IoT system. This
    integration speeds up the interaction between citizens, companies, and the government
    [21]. The main aim of this section is to provide a ground for the future research
    directions for the researcher in the same domain. This section discusses the open
    issues that still need to be addressed to secure the IoT systems. In the security
    of the IoT, challenges like identity management, storage capabilities, unauthorization,
    data communication are still the issue which needs to be taken care of. Fig. 2.
    Blockchain integration benefits Show All SECTION IV. Open Issues and Future Scope
    There are so many advantages of using blockchain with the IoT but if we used it
    carefully and with proper caution then only it will become an advantage for securing
    the IoT. Blockchain can revolutionize the IoT as it can help to improve the applications
    of the IoT [22]. Integration of blockchain with IoT solves so many issues that
    are faced by the IoT system. This integration speeds up the interaction between
    citizens, companies, and the government [23]. The main aim of this section is
    to provide a ground for the future research directions for the researcher in the
    same domain. This section discusses the open issues that still need to be addressed
    to secure the IoT systems. In the security of the IoT, challenges like identity
    management, storage capabilities, un-authorization, data communication are still
    the issue which needs to be taken care of. Conclusion The evolution of IoT makes
    the life better of mankind. The idea of IoT is to modernize the life of a common
    man and to enhance the quality of the life with less human intervention and with
    less human effort. The idea is to connect various devices with the internet and
    how to make intelligent decisions. IoT allows us to automate everything around
    us. The day is not really far when machine will interact with the machine without
    any involvement of the humans and will achieve greater efficiency in every field.
    This paper outlines the major security and privacy issues based on each layer
    of the IoT architecture. Other challenges apart from the security and privacy
    issues like interoperability, scalability, legal issues are also discussed. Blockchain
    is considered as one of the remedies for the possible solution for the IoT. Hence,
    it is the need of the time to develop a secure IoT system based on blockchain
    that will meet up all the requirements of the future. The integration of Blockchain
    with IoT is discussed in a detailed manner. But these are two different technology
    having different nature thus having certain limitations and challenges like data
    storage, some legal issues related with blockchain still need to be addressed.
    This paper tries to give a better idea about the future scope of the integration
    of blockchain as a solution. Still, some open issues are there which need to be
    addressed have been discussed along with the future direction to help the new
    researchers. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics More Like This

  key_findings: IoT systems face various security and privacy challenges, including
    the need for robust access control and authentication mechanisms. Blockchain has
    the potential to address these challenges by providing secure data storage, tamper-proof
    transactions, and decentralized authentication. However, the integration of blockchain

    Abstract: Agriculture 5.0 refers to the next phase of agricultural development,
    building upon the

    previous digital revolution in the agrarian sector and aiming to transform the
    agricultural industry

    to be smarter, more effective, and ecologically conscious. Farming processes have
    already started

    becoming more efﬁcient due to the development of digital technologies, including
    big data, artiﬁcial

    intelligence (AI), robotics, the Internet of Things (IoT), and virtual and augmented
    reality. Farmers

    can make the most of the resources at their disposal thanks to this data-driven
    approach, allowing

    them to effectively cultivate and sustain crops on arable land. The European Union
    (EU) aims to

    make food systems fair, healthy, and environmentally sustainable through the Green
    Deal and its

    farm-to-fork, soil, and biodiversity strategies, zero pollution action plan, and
    upcoming sustainable

    use of pesticides regulation. Many of the historical synthetic pesticides are
    not currently registered

    in the EU market. In addition, the continuous use of a limited number of active
    ingredients with

    the same mode of action scales up pests/pathogens/weed resistance potential. Increasing
    plant

    protection challenges as well as having fewer chemical pesticides to apply require
    innovation and

    smart solutions for crop production. Biopesticides tend to pose fewer risks to
    human health and the

    environment, their efﬁcacy depends on various factors that cannot be controlled
    through traditional

    application strategies. This paper aims to disclose the contribution of robotic
    systems in Agriculture

    5.0 ecosystems, highlighting both the challenges and limitations of this technology.
    Speciﬁcally, this

    work documents current threats to agriculture (climate change, invasive pests,
    diseases, and costs)

    and how robotics and AI can act as countermeasures to deal with such threats.
    Finally, speciﬁc case

    studies and the application of intelligent robotic systems to them are analyzed,
    and the architecture

    for our intelligent decision system is proposed.

    1. Introduction

    Agriculture 5.0 constitutes an entire ecosystem; it aims to integrate emerging
    technolo-

    gies, such as AI, IoT, and ML in agriculture, to improve productivity while promoting
    sus-

    tainability and decision-making processes. Enhancing traditional farming practices
    through

    automation and scalable technology solutions is meant to reduce risks, enhance
    sustain-

    ability, and provide predictive decision-making for growers [1,2]. Moreover, data-driven

    agriculture and advanced farm management systems are becoming increasingly important

    in the contemporary agrarian sector. Smart agriculture relies on objective information

    acquired through sensors to make optimal decisions and maximize productivity while

    ensuring resource efﬁciency and environmental sustainability. By incorporating
    robotic

    solutions and AI techniques, data-driven agriculture lays the groundwork for sustainable

    agriculture in the future. In relation to Industry 5.0 (which emphasizes collaboration
    be-

    tween humans and intelligent machines, with a focus on resilience and sustainability),

    Machines 2023, 11, 774

    Agriculture 5.0 seeks to reconcile the need for sufﬁcient and affordable food
    production

    with the preservation of ecosystems. While Industry and Agriculture 4.0 focus
    mainly on

    technologies, like IoT and Big Data, Industry and Agriculture 5.0 add human, environmen-

    tal, and social aspects to the equation. The transition from the digital farming
    revolution to

    Agriculture 5.0 is considered critical for the future well-being of farmers and
    the gradual

    shift to efﬁcient, intelligent, and autonomous farms in terms of energy consumption.
    In-

    tegrating emerging technologies and alternative energy sources into Agriculture
    5.0 can

    provide cost-effective access to ﬁnance, weather updates, remote monitoring, and
    future

    energy solutions for smart farm installations.

    According to the European Agricultural Industry (EU-27), the growing demands on

    agricultural products as well as the growing world population have raised the
    demand

    for an increased production yield. Note that agriculture possesses strong links
    with food

    processing and farm machinery sectors. The latter is directly affected by the
    performance

    of the agrarian sector; thus, the total economic impact of agriculture is multiplied
    [3].

    More speciﬁcally, the global population increase and the consecutive exponential
    one in

    food demand have led to a search for more efﬁcient ways of production, both in
    terms

    of production size and quality of products. Speciﬁcally, the above reasons caused
    the

    Third Agricultural Revolution to ﬂourish by introducing vital technological pillars
    in the

    agricultural ﬁeld. The mentioned stations are: (i) the selective breeding to improve
    the

    quality of food in products for humans and animals as well as (ii) the use of
    chemical fertil-

    izers and synthetic pesticides for increased quality production with a low environmental

    footprint. Chemical pesticides used to protect crops from pests, pathogens, and
    weeds pose

    acute and long-term risks to humans and other non-target organisms [4]. Moreover,
    many

    pesticides and their degradation products persist in the environment for many
    years [5].

    The farm-to-fork, soil, and biodiversity strategies, as well as the zero pollution
    action

    plan, include ambitious and speciﬁc targets on pesticides, fertilizers, biological
    agriculture,

    and resistance development against pesticides (https://ec.europa.eu/info/food-farming-

    ﬁsheries/sustainability/environmental-sustainability/cap-andenvironment_en (accessed

    on 1 April 2023)) [6]. Some clear targets to be achieved by 2030 are to reduce
    chemicals

    and more hazardous pesticides by 50%, reduce fertilizer use by 20%, and enhance
    the

    organic farming sector by 25% of total farmland (https://ec.europa.eu/info/food-farming-

    ﬁsheries/farming/organic-farming/organic-production-and-products_en (accessed
    on

    1 April 2023)). New technological advances must be introduced in traditional agricultural

    systems to support those EU targets. Hence, process automation can be a modern
    way

    of handling this situation. The high-tech precision agriculture systems result
    from the

    research and development of interdisciplinary teams in mechatronics and agronomy
    [7].

    In this context, various vehicles have been developed, which are capable of moving
    in

    difﬁcult rural terrains, while the development of drones has given new impetus
    to several

    applications, such as crop health assessment, plant monitoring, etc. These developments

    allow modern mechatronic systems to collect data, communicate wirelessly, and
    share

    large sizes of data between them [8,9]. The above data constitute a cornerstone
    of precision

    farming since they can be used for timely and accurate spraying of fungicides,
    insecticides

    and herbicides, fruit harvesting when appropriate for ripening, etc. This enables
    intelligent

    cultivation, production automation, and production automation, saving farmers’
    time in

    various stages of production, such as sowing, spraying, harvesting, etc. At the
    same time,

    farmers have the ability to control their processes and results through communication

    technology [10]. The evolution of modern robots has an impact on improving the
    quality of

    crops by increasing both the proﬁtability of producers as well as the choice-consumption

    of quality food [11]. Therefore, the implementation of new technologies helps
    to restrict

    dosing and dispersal, thereby reducing the environmental consequences. However,
    inde-

    pendent of their targeted operational environment, contemporary robots should
    be smart

    and, thus, retain advanced perception abilities [12,13]. These capabilities are
    highly related

    to how the robots understand, interpret, and represent their environment and its
    elements

    (such as crops, leaves, etc.), and each individual productive entity (e.g., plants,
    trees, pests,

    Machines 2023, 11, 774

    3 of 15

    pathogens, etc.). Semantic mapping is salutary and can provide viable solutions
    to related

    problems [14]. Also, the heterogeneous data extracted from an integrated system
    are neces-

    sary to be understandable and useful for the direct actions of the producers/farmers
    or for

    the direct supply to another robot system that implements the next action (for
    example,

    spraying, collecting fruit, etc.). The above challenges involve system advancements
    in

    terms of dependability and semantic perception abilities with the ultimate requirement
    of

    being operable in different environments.

    Crop protection constitutes a major food production component. Using cutting-edge

    technologies such as the introduction of low-risk pesticides, precision farming,
    and genome

    editing will help to keep modern agriculture sustainable. Timely monitoring of
    crop

    protection problems and targeted application of the ﬁt-for-purpose pesticide would
    reduce

    the overall risk and increase the efﬁcacy of each application. Speciﬁcally, our
    proposed

    system will contribute to improving crop protection by making it more efﬁcient
    and robust.

    The main contributions of our work are summarized as follows:

    •

    To summarize the most recent and relevant literature in the domain of smart farming

    through robots.

    •

    To highlight and stress the beneﬁts of introducing an autonomous robotic ecosystem
    in

    the agricultural ﬁeld.

    •

    To reveal the technological challenges and barriers to introducing such solutions
    in

    this domain.

    •

    To propose a conceptual framework for the realization of robotized systems in
    agricul-

    tural environments to help with their protection.

    •

    To explore potential improvements in pesticide efﬁcacy by providing timely pesticide

    delivery to targets.

    •

    To investigate strategies for reducing the risk posed by pesticide applications
    to non-

    target organisms.

    •

    To discuss the development of a decision support system for selecting low-risk
    pesticides

    among the available options.

    The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Firstly, the crop justiﬁcation
    is analyzed

    in Section 2. In Section 3, we discuss related works in the ﬁeld of precision
    agriculture.

    In the same section, the problem formulation is also presented. Section 4 describes
    the

    agriculture ﬁeld requirements, and the next section highlights the beneﬁts of
    utilizing AI

    methods. In Section 5, we analyze the proposed system and its architecture. In
    Section 6, a

    discussion of our ﬁndings is provided, while in Section 7, our conclusions are
    drawn and

    plans for future work are presented.

    2. Crop Justiﬁcation

    Two important crops for the EU economy were selected as case studies. A ﬁeld crop

    (wheat) and a perennial crop (olive) constitute our models, covering different
    (i) crop-

    ping systems, (ii) pest/weed/pathogen severity, and (iii) registered pesticides.
    The olive

    tree (Olea europea L.) is a universal tree that has accompanied Mediterranean
    agriculture

    for thousands of years. Nowadays, over 750 million olive trees are cultivated
    world-

    wide, 95% of which are in the Mediterranean region. The fruit, oil, and branches
    of

    olive trees have been culturally and economically tightly linked with Mediterranean
    his-

    tory (https://agriculture.ec.europa.eu/news/producing-69-worlds-production-eu-largest-

    producer-olive-oil-2020-02-04_en (accessed on 20 April 2023)). About 98% of olive
    oil

    and 80% of table olive production are from Mediterranean countries. Approximately

    70% of the world’s olive oil production is concentrated in Europe. In the EU,
    olive tree

    plantations are found in nine EU Member States: Spain, Italy, Greece, Portugal,
    Cyprus,

    France, Croatia, Slovenia, and Malta. EU olive production reached 10,908,000 tonnes

    and EUR 2255 million in 2016 [15]. The average annual olive yield and product
    qual-

    ity varied between years, reﬂecting the effect of plant protection problems. The
    olive

    tree is a long-living drought-tolerant species that is limited by many biotic
    stressors (e.g.,

    pests, diseases, and weeds). Bactrocera oleae, Prays oleae, Euphyllura spp., Saissetia
    oleae,

    Machines 2023, 11, 774

    4 of 15

    Parlatoria oleae, and Eriophyidae mites are the most important pests and Cycloconium
    oleag-

    inum, Glomerella cingulata, Pseudomonas syringae pv. savastanoi are among the
    diseases receiv-

    ing chemical control by various pesticides. In the EU, olive cultivation tends
    to move from

    traditional low-density systems to new, high-density, super-intensive cropping
    systems.

    All of these changes have affected the incidence and severity of pests and diseases.
    In olive

    trees, at least ten of the currently registered pesticides, one insecticide (lambda-Cyhalothrin),

    seven fungicides (Bordeaux mixture, copper hydroxide, copper oxide, copper oxychloride,

    Difenoconazole, Tebuconazole, Tribasic copper sulfate), and two herbicides (Diﬂufenican,

    Metribuzin) are listed as candidates for substitution. Copper products are used
    in high

    quantities and most alternatives lack copper efﬁcacy. Moreover, the limited number
    of

    pesticides registered for use in olives has resulted in resistance development
    to most pests,

    diseases, and weeds against insecticides, fungicides, and herbicides, respectively.
    Table 1

    summarizes the currently registered pesticides in olive trees. Cereal grains have
    numerous

    uses, such as bread, semolina, and pasta; they are also important components of
    animal

    feed and serve as raw material in the production of products such as alcohol,
    beer, starch,

    and dextrin, and are used in the glucose industry. In the EU, the cereal sector
    accounted

    for approximately 11% of the total output value of agricultural production in
    2016 and it

    is an important sector in the northern member states (https://www.europarl.europa.eu/

    RegData/etudes/BRIE/2019/640143/EPRS_BRI(2019)640143_EN.pdf (accessed on 1 April

    2023)). The EU cereal sector is facing structural, ﬁnancial, and climatic challenges.
    Russia’s

    war against Ukraine has put global food security at risk and has contributed signiﬁcantly

    to the growing wheat and wheat ﬂour prices. Around one-third of the EU’s cereal
    imports

    in 2021 came from Ukraine and Russia; following the war, the EU had to undertake
    all

    measures to certify EU cereal production. Wheat, the most important cereal crop
    cultivated

    worldwide, is used to prepare bread for approximately 40% of the global population
    [16].

    Wheat is an important commodity in Europe, with a production of 133 million tonnes
    per

    year. Wheat production depends on numerous production factors, and the use of
    pesti-

    cides is important for increasing the quantity and quality of wheat production.
    Pesticides

    help to control pests and diseases or their vectors, as well as reduce spoilage
    during stor-

    age. Broadleaf and grassy weeds, diseases (Puccinia striiformis/graminis/recondita,
    Erysiphe

    graminis, Septoria tritici/nodorum, Fusarium spp. Tilletia caries, Ustilago nuda,
    Ustilago spp.,

    Rhizoctonia spp.), insects (Agrotis spp., Rhopalosiphum padi, Sitobion avenae,
    Limothrips cere-

    alium), and other pests can reduce wheat crop yields, and the use of pesticides
    helps to

    minimize these losses. In the early stages of crop development, using herbicides
    to con-

    trol weed infestations is essential for achieving optimal grain yield and desired
    economic

    beneﬁts. With wheat, at least two insecticides (Cypermethrin, lambda-Cyhalothrin),
    one

    fungicide (Tebuconazole), and two herbicides (Pendimethalin, Metsulfuron-methyl)
    from

    the current authorized products are listed as candidates for substitution. Wheat
    production

    is also threatened by the development of weed resistance against most registered
    herbicides,

    and there are numerous instances of insects and fungi developing resistance against
    insecti-

    cides and fungicides, respectively. While the investigation into less harmful
    compounds

    to substitute undesirable pesticides is an important strategy, other promising
    smart farm-

    ing technologies (innovative formulations), tools (innovative spraying equipment),
    and

    methodologies (lower dosages) can contribute to increased pesticide efﬁcacy and
    reduced

    impact on the environment and human health. Table 2 summarizes the currently registered

    pesticides in wheat. AI can help in the selection of the most appropriate pesticides
    in order

    to achieve the highest efﬁciency against targeted crop protection problems and
    the lowest

    risks for resistance development and hazards related to non-target organisms.
    The mode of

    action of pesticides, the life cycle and susceptibility of pests/pathogens/weeds,
    stability,

    leaching and runoff potential, environmental conditions, and availability of application

    technologies are among the major factors that an AI system can be trained to handle.

    an overview of the relevant literature. The purpose of this section is to contextualize
    the

    Machines 2023, 11, 774

    gaps in the research can be identiﬁed, providing a rationale for our study. This
    section also

    allows readers to situate the research within a broader scholarly conversation
    and provides

    a foundation for the argument presented in the paper.

    The importance of crop area (CA) protection can be attributed to the growing pop-

    ulation. Automatic mapping using information extracted from high-spatial resolution

    remote sensing (RS) images is powerful for acquiring accurate and up-to-date CA
    maps.

    RS image information extraction includes feature classiﬁcation, which is a long-standing

    research issue in the RS community [13]. Emerging deep learning techniques, such
    as the

    deep semantic segmentation network technique, are effective methods to automatically

    discover relevant contextual features and obtain better image classiﬁcation results
    [17].

    More speciﬁcally, several studies have dealt with agricultural precision sectors,
    contributing

    to increased agricultural yields. Note that the authors of [18] applied transfer
    learning

    to domain adaptation—from the source domain to the plant domain—by using a major

    category in the plant domain. Category adaptation was performed from the major
    to minor

    categories within the plant domain. UAVs are immediately accessible tools for
    remote sens-

    ing scientists and farmers. In recent years, small commercial UAVs (<50 kg) [19]
    have been

    available for environmental and agricultural applications. Much of the research
    on preci-

    sion agriculture for conservation has focused on strategically placing conservation
    areas to

    minimize runoff contaminants (e.g., sediment, nutrients, and pesticides) and,
    subsequently,

    increasing water quality [20]. The approach in [21] stated that spatial variability
    in soil,

    crops, and topographic characteristics, combined with temporal variability between
    sea-

    sons, could lead to variable annual yield patterns. The complexity of interactions
    between

    yield-limiting factors, such as soil nutrients and soil water, requires specialized
    statistical

    processing to quantify convenience and, thus, inform crop management practices.
    This

    study used multiple linear regression models, cubic regression, and neural propagation

    networks to predict performance.

    Generally, the advent of AI and robotized solutions have revolutionized crop protection

    by offering advanced capabilities and precision in addressing agricultural challenges.
    These

    technologies enable automated monitoring, early detection of pests and diseases,
    targeted

    application of treatments, and efficient resource management, leading to increased
    crop

    yields and sustainable farming practices. Semantic recognition plays a crucial
    role in crop

    protection by enabling the identification and classification of pests, diseases,
    and other threats

    to agricultural crops [13,14]. Through advanced algorithms and machine learning
    techniques,

    semantic recognition systems can accurately analyze images, sensor data, and other
    inputs to

    provide timely and targeted interventions, leading to improved crop health and
    yield [22,23].

    In recent years, different machine learning techniques have been implemented to
    achieve

    accurate yield prediction for different crops. The most successful techniques
    used support

    vector regression [24], M5-Prime regression trees [25], and k-nearest neighbor
    [26]. The authors

    created the spiking neural network (SNN) model for timely crop yield prediction.
    The above

    approach [27] introduces SNN as a promising technique for spatiotemporal data
    modeling

    and crop analysis prediction. Because deep learning techniques have the capability
    to extract

    feature maps from data for estimation, they can be expected to have less dependency
    on

    the input data. Even in rural areas where data acquisition is limited, deep learning
    can be

    expected to provide good crop yield estimation [28].

    In [29], the obstacles faced in implementing smart agri-robotic solutions for
    global

    broadacre crop production were analyzed. The authors argued that the current strategies

    and technologies used in agri-robotics are insufﬁcient to address the unique complexities

    associated with large-scale crop farming. They identify several key challenges,
    including

    the unpredictable nature of diverse broadacre crops, the necessity for adaptable
    robotic

    systems, and the intricate decision-making processes involved in crop management.
    To

    overcome these challenges effectively, the authors proposed fundamentally rethinking

    existing approaches and technologies, like machine learning, computer vision,
    and sensor

    networks, as essential components of smart agri-robotic solutions. Furthermore,
    the authors

    Machines 2023, 11, 774

    7 of 15

    of [30] presented an in-depth analysis of the use of intelligent robot systems
    in the ﬁeld

    of ecological agriculture. The paper emphasized the signiﬁcance of adopting advanced

    technologies to address challenges related to pest control and promote sustainable
    farming

    practices. By integrating robotic platforms, sensors, imaging techniques, and
    artiﬁcial

    intelligence algorithms, the paper discussed how these technologies enable precise
    and

    targeted pest management strategies, reduce reliance on chemical pesticides, and
    minimize

    environmental impacts. The beneﬁts of intelligent robot plant protection systems,
    such

    as improved efﬁciency, reduced labor requirements, and enhanced crop yield, are
    high-

    lighted. The authors also acknowledge potential challenges in implementing these
    systems,

    including cost, scalability, and compatibility with existing agricultural practices.

    Subsequently, the approach in [31] provides a comprehensive summary of the role
    and

    impact of robotics, IoT, and AI in automating the agricultural sector. The review
    explores

    various applications of these advanced technologies, including automated harvesting,

    precision agriculture, crop monitoring, livestock management, and smart irrigation
    systems.

    It highlights how the integration of robotics, IoT, and AI can enhance efﬁciency,
    productivity,

    and sustainability in farming practices. The paper also emphasizes the importance
    of

    incorporating data analytics and machine learning algorithms for intelligent decision-

    making in agriculture. Finally, it addresses the challenges associated with implementing

    these technologies, such as cost, scalability, interoperability, and data privacy.

    Moreover, in [32], the authors presented a comprehensive overview of the integration
    of

    machine learning and emerging technologies in precision crop protection, specifically
    focusing

    on the transition towards Agriculture 5.0. Specifically, the paper explored the
    immense

    potential of these technologies to revolutionize farming practices, improve sustainability,

    and optimize crop protection strategies. By delving into various areas, such as
    machine

    learning algorithms, sensor technologies, remote sensing, IoT, and data analytics,
    the review

    examined how these technologies could be utilized to enhance crucial aspects of
    agriculture,

    including crop monitoring, pest detection, disease diagnosis, and targeted application
    of

    agrochemicals. The authors emphasized the significance of context-aware and data-driven

    decision-making to achieve precision crop protection in the evolving agricultural
    landscape.

    Then, it addressed pertinent issues, such as data quality, scalability, privacy
    concerns, and the

    need for interdisciplinary collaboration among researchers, farmers, and policymakers.
    By

    highlighting these challenges, this approach provides a holistic view of the potential
    barriers

    and considerations that need to be addressed for successful implementation.

    4. Analysis of Agriculture Field Requirements

    As the global population is projected to surpass 9 billion by 2050, the agricultural

    industry will have to satisfy the increasing demand for food. Pesticides will
    play a cru-

    cial role in ensuring high crop yields. Pesticides, according to the Food and
    Agriculture

    Organization (FAO), include substances of natural or synthetic chemicals or biological

    ingredients used to repel, destroy, or regulate pests and regulate plant growth.
    They help

    to protect seeds and crops from unwanted plants, insects, bacteria, fungi, and
    rodents, and

    come in various types, such as herbicides, insecticides, fungicides, rodenticides,
    and ne-

    maticides [33]. However, pesticides, herbicides, and chemicals have increased
    signiﬁcantly

    in recent years to manage plant diseases and increase crop productivity. This
    increases

    crop quantity, but it often lowers the quality, pollutes the land and groundwater,
    and

    poses several health risks, causing nearly 300,000 deaths worldwide each year.
    Early-stage

    disease detection using IoT-based solutions that deploy various sensors can help
    reduce

    the use of harmful chemicals. AI techniques, such as vision-based techniques using
    image

    processing, machine learning, and deep learning algorithms, have also been proposed
    for

    disease detection automation [34].

    In recent years, signiﬁcant advances have been made in the use of deep learning

    (DL) approaches to build high-performance AI models for plant disease detection.
    Some

    lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods show promise for
    use

    in IoT applications. Despite advancements in these vision-based methods, real-world

    Machines 2023, 11, 774

    8 of 15

    detection of plant diseases remains challenging due to complex backgrounds and
    varying

    environmental conditions. Crop monitoring through aerial/drone-based surveillance
    can

    be an alternative solution, but robust and reliable vision-based techniques are
    required to

    work for various crops. Expert knowledge and thorough training are required to
    recognize

    early symptoms of plant diseases and take timely action to prevent further spread
    [35].

    Plant diseases are classiﬁed into different categories, and visible symptoms are
    important

    in identifying diseases. Smart agriculture systems using AI methods for plant
    disease

    detection can be effective solutions to combat the problem of crop loss. There
    have been

    successful case studies in developing countries, but ﬁeld disease diagnosis in
    real time is

    still difﬁcult. Several models have been proposed to detect healthy and diseased
    leaves

    from various crops using CNN classiﬁcation techniques, achieving high accuracy
    [36].

    AI techniques for crop protection in agriculture have become increasingly prevalent

    in recent years, allowing for more efﬁcient and accurate identiﬁcation of pests,
    diseases,

    and soil deﬁciencies. AI sensors are now being utilized to identify and target
    weeds, with

    the appropriate herbicides then being applied to the speciﬁc area. In addition,
    integrating

    IoT sensors and supporting technologies, such as drones, geographic information
    systems

    (GISs), and other tools allow for real-time data monitoring, measurement, and
    storage.

    The aforementioned data can empower farmers by providing valuable insights into
    areas

    needing irrigation, fertilization, or pesticide treatment. This enables them to
    make well-

    informed decisions, effectively allocating resources and minimizing unnecessary
    expenses.

    Overall, incorporating AI techniques into agriculture use cases can lead to improved

    harvest quality, reduced herbicide usage, increased proﬁts, and signiﬁcant cost
    savings [35].

    Precision weed management is an efﬁcient tool to meet the EU targets for pesticide
    use

    reduction. In ﬁeld crops, like wheat, weed control is crucial to any plant protection

    scheme. Most of the proposed commercial technologies and prototypes for precision
    weed

    control consist of three essential elements (i) sensors for weed/crop detection,
    (ii) decision

    algorithms regarding the type of herbicides that would be the most efﬁcient, and
    (iii) a

    precise sprayer to deliver the appropriate dose of each herbicide to the targeted
    weed. Of

    the above-mentioned parts, inputs and validation of the decision algorithm are
    the most

    crucial for increasing the efﬁciency and reducing the risk of the applied herbicide
    [37].

    Saving herbicides by applying AI techniques in wheat depends on the location,
    stage, and

    distribution of the weeds [38]. The accuracy of the detected weeds could reach
    up to about

    99% [39]. Apart from weed management, scientiﬁc modeling has also been employed
    for

    forecasting in an IoT context involving fungal diseases in winter wheat [40].
    The recent

    progress in AI and automation have been applied to a machine-learning-based classiﬁcation

    approach to distinguish pests of tree crops, including the olive fruit ﬂy (Bactrocera
    oleae [41].

    In addition, online analytical processing models have been used to combine inputs
    in an

    integrated pest management scheme of olive tree crop protection [42].

    5. Beneﬁts of Utilizing AI Methods in Crop Protection

    The integration of robotics and artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) into agriculture has
    rev-

    olutionized the way crops are grown and protected. While the title “Sustainable
    Crop

    Protection via Robotics and Artiﬁcial Intelligence Solutions” suggests a focus
    on pest

    control, it is crucial to recognize that AI and robotics can contribute to comprehensive

    crop protection strategies. By leveraging these technologies, we can enhance agricultural

    practices and ensure a sustainable future for food production. While our primary
    focus

    lies in crop protection, speciﬁcally in the realms of weed and disease management,
    it is

    essential to acknowledge the broader scope of whole crop protection and monitoring.
    In

    this section, we aim to provide a concise overview of these additional components
    and

    highlight the invaluable contribution of AI solutions to these areas.

    Crop protection encompasses various factors beyond weeds and diseases that sig-

    niﬁcantly impact crop health and yield. Elements such as climate conditions, nutrition

    optimization, cultural activities, and plant physiology play crucial roles in
    ensuring com-

    Machines 2023, 11, 774

    9 of 15

    prehensive crop protection strategies. By leveraging AI solutions, we can unlock
    new

    possibilities and advancements in each of these areas.

    Climate adaptation and resilience: Climate change poses signiﬁcant challenges
    to

    agricultural productivity. AI and robotics can play pivotal roles in adapting
    and mitigating

    climate-related risks. Advanced algorithms can process vast amounts of climatic
    data,

    helping farmers make informed decisions about planting times, water usage, and
    crop

    selection. Robotics equipped with environmental sensors can monitor weather conditions,

    soil moisture levels, and pest outbreaks, providing real-time data to optimize
    crop manage-

    ment. With AI-driven climate modeling, farmers can anticipate weather patterns,
    allowing

    for timely adjustments and minimizing crop losses [32].

    Nutrition optimization: Achieving optimal crop nutrition is crucial for both yield
    and

    quality. AI and robotics can optimize nutrient management by analyzing soil composition,

    plant nutrient requirements, and growth patterns. Intelligent systems can monitor
    nutrient

    deﬁciencies or excesses, enabling precise application of fertilizers or other
    supplements.

    Additionally, robotics can automate tasks such as precision seeding, weeding,
    and nutrient

    delivery, minimizing waste and maximizing resource efﬁciency. By tailoring nutrition

    strategies to speciﬁc crop needs, AI and robotics contribute to sustainable agriculture
    while

    reducing environmental impacts [43].

    Cultural Activities and Labor Optimization: Agriculture encompasses a range of

    cultural activities that are essential for successful crop production. AI and
    robotics can

    automate and streamline various tasks, reducing labor-intensive efforts and optimizing

    resource allocation. For example, robotic systems can perform time-consuming activities

    such as harvesting, pruning, and sorting with greater accuracy and efﬁciency.
    By automat-

    ing repetitive tasks, farmers can focus on higher-value activities, such as crop
    planning,

    disease management, and market analysis. The integration of AI and robotics not
    only

    enhances productivity but also improves the quality of life for farmers, making
    agriculture

    a more attractive profession [44].

    Enhancing plant physiology and health: Understanding plant physiology is vital

    for effective crop protection. AI can analyze large datasets on plant physiology,
    growth

    patterns, and disease symptoms, enabling early detection and intervention. By
    analyzing

    the relationships between plant traits and environmental conditions, AI can develop
    models

    to predict plant stress and disease susceptibility. Robots equipped with cameras
    and sensors

    can precisely monitor plant health, detecting signs of nutrient deﬁciencies, water
    stress,

    or pest damage. This data-driven approach allows for proactive management strategies,

    reducing the reliance on reactive measures and promoting sustainable plant health
    [32].

    Furthermore, we outline some additional advantages of utilizing artiﬁcial intelligence

    (AI) methods in crop protection and agriculture as a whole. By enhancing precision
    agricul-

    ture, AI systems are improving the overall accuracy and quality of crop yields.
    Primarily,

    AI technology plays a role in detecting plant diseases, pests, and poor soil nutrition.
    Using

    AI-based sensors, weeds can be identiﬁed and targeted, and the appropriate herbicide

    can be applied in the area. Additionally, AI techniques allow for the collection
    of soil

    health data, fertilizer recommendations, weather monitoring, and tracking of the
    product’s

    readiness [45]. Hence, farmers are empowered to make informed decisions throughout
    the

    crop-growing process. Precision agriculture is a technique that incorporates the
    most efﬁ-

    cient soil management practices, variable rate technology, and optimal data management

    methods to help farmers enhance crop yields and minimize expenses. AI can offer
    real-time

    insights to farmers, allowing them to identify which areas require irrigation,
    fertilization,

    or pesticide treatment [46]. Additionally, innovative farming methods such as
    vertical

    agriculture can boost food production while minimizing resource usage. This approach

    reduces herbicide use, improves harvest quality, increases proﬁts, and has signiﬁcant
    cost

    savings. By employing IoT sensors and other supporting technologies, farmers can
    monitor,

    measure, and store ﬁeld data on various metrics in real time. Combining AI-based
    farming

    tools with IoT devices and software quickly provides farmers with more accurate
    informa-

    Machines 2023, 11, 774

    10 of 15

    tion. Having better data enables farmers to make more informed decisions, reducing
    the

    time and money spent on trial and error [47].

    6. Proposed Framework

    6.1. Background and Use Case Scenario

    Crop protection is an essential aspect of modern agriculture, and the use of fungicides,

    insecticides, and herbicides is common. However, the indiscriminate use of chemicals
    can

    lead to environmental damage and harmful effects on human health. An AI- and robotics-

    based crop protection system can provide a sustainable and efﬁcient solution to
    this prob-

    lem. The objective of this conceptual scenario is to develop an AI- and robotics-based
    crop

    protection system that minimizes the use of chemicals, chooses the most appropriate
    pesti-

    cide, and improves crop yield. The proposed methodology—as an example case—is
    applied

    to the agricultural crops colorof wheat and olive trees based on the following
    assumptions:

    (i) Major plant protection problems (pests/weeds/pathogens) of the selected crops
    (wheat

    and olive tree) have been identiﬁed (Tables 1 and 2). (ii) Registered insecticides,
    fungicides,

    and herbicides have been categorized as conventional, low-risk, and candidates
    for sub-

    stitution. It is also necessary to integrate the following: (iii) A decision support
    system

    regarding the selection of the most appropriate pesticide on an integrated pest
    management

    (IPM) system. (iv) Environmental factors affecting efﬁcacy and the environmental
    fate of

    pesticides. (v) Legislation and other policy information. The proposed crop protection

    scheme can be applied to environmentally sensitive cases (e.g., near protected
    surface- and

    ground-water bodies, sensitive non-target organisms, like bees, earthworms, and
    beneﬁcial

    microbes) or in cases of resistance to pesticides pests/pathogens/weeds.

    6.2. Concept

    The proposed concept incorporates a comprehensive and research-driven approach

    to revolutionize crop protection and enhance agricultural practices. A preliminary
    phase

    involves the creation of an extensive database that encompasses detailed information
    about

    various plant diseases, their corresponding pesticides, and the overall health
    status of plants.

    This database forms the foundation for accurately identifying the specific disease
    based

    on the symptoms exhibited by candidate plants. To ensure practical implementation,
    the

    system utilizes portable devices, such as smartphones or tablets, to provide farmers
    with

    images of diseased plants for disease recognition. In larger crop areas, a UAV
    equipped

    with visual sensors, capable of high or low-resolution imaging, can perform the
    disease- and

    pest-recognition process. Additionally, the system obtains georeferenced data
    on the examined

    plants, enabling the determination of potential disease spread to nearby crops
    within the area.

    Moreover, the system goes beyond disease identiﬁcation and extends its capabilities

    to identify weed species and distribute grassy and broadleaf weeds automatically.
    This

    information empowers the system to automatically employ AI to select the most
    appro-

    priate herbicide. In the future, selective spraying techniques utilizing UAVs
    could be

    implemented, provided that technological feasibility is achieved. This exciting
    prospect

    has the potential to revolutionize crop protection practices. The system also
    incorporates

    information on insect populations obtained from digital traps or other monitoring
    sys-

    tems. In the pesticide prioritization process, considerations regarding the pesticide
    risk to

    non-target organisms in wheat and olive agroecosystems can be considered. The
    system

    adapts to speciﬁc crop/pesticide combinations by incorporating pesticide cutoff
    criteria or

    dedicated authorization schemes aligned with national or regional legislation.

    Furthermore, the proposed system is designed to seamlessly communicate with other

    components of Agriculture 5.0. These include automatic watering functions, autonomous

    spraying robots, weather sensors, and software for optimizing spraying schedules,
    har-

    vesting, and other farming operations. By leveraging these interconnected components,

    the system aims to optimize farm protection, create a sustainable ecosystem, and
    foster a

    holistic approach to agriculture. The proposed framework is depicted in Figure
    1, highlight-

    ing the systematic ﬂowchart of the entire process. Its primary focus revolves
    around crop

    Machines 2023, 11, 774

    11 of 15

    protection, which is continuously threatened by weeds, pests, and diseases. Building
    upon

    this pipeline, the aim is to establish a digital ecosystem, termed the industrial
    metaverse

    (IM) digital world, which is capable of recording the complete life cycles of
    agricultural

    crops. This digital ecosystem will gather extensive information about the rural
    environment

    by leveraging IoT, virtual reality (including augmented reality capabilities),
    cloud and edge

    computing, and other features of Industry 5.0 (Agriculture 5.0), as depicted in
    Figure 2.

    Figure 1. A ﬂowchart of the crop protection system with AI and robotics techniques.

    Figure 2. High-level architecture of a crop protection system with AI and robotics
    techniques.

    Ultimately, the industrial metaverse comprises an explainable AI system that derives

    actionable results to improve production, environmental sustainability, and economic

    status. This comprehensive approach fosters communication across the supply-value
    chain,

    enhances responsiveness to potential issues, and improves safety, production efﬁciency,

    and environmental monitoring in real time. By leveraging the power of technology
    and

    research-driven methodologies, the proposed system aims to revolutionize agriculture
    and

    pave the way for a more sustainable and efﬁcient future.

    6.3. Architecture

    The methodology of the above-described system for improving crop protection is

    based on extensive research and aims to provide a convincing and actionable solution.

    The proposed architecture encompasses various data collection techniques and advanced

    Machines 2023, 11, 774

    12 of 15

    technologies, as illustrated in Figure 2. The agriculture ﬁeld’s digital transformation
    begins

    with IoT sensors for irrigation and weather monitoring. These sensors gather real-time
    data

    on soil moisture levels, temperature, humidity, and other relevant factors. Additionally,

    AI techniques are employed to recognize plant diseases based on visual cues and
    patterns,

    allowing for early detection and timely intervention. The production evolution
    aspect

    involves monitoring and analyzing crop growth and development over time.

    The AI- and robotics-based crop protection system comprises several modules that

    work in tandem to enhance agricultural practices:

    Data collection module: To generate valuable insights, the system collects data
    from

    diverse sources, including weather reports, soil sensors, satellite imagery, and
    digital insect

    traps. This comprehensive dataset enables accurate predictions of pest infestations,
    disease

    outbreaks, weed growth, and weather conditions.

    Machine learning model development and interpretation module: This module

    involves the creation of automated systems that process data and derive meaningful

    conclusions. The system provides clear and actionable insights to guide decision-making

    by interpreting results from machine learning models.

    Decision-making module: AI algorithms analyze the collected data and determine

    appropriate crop protection strategies. Factors considered include crop type,
    growth stage,

    severity of pests, weeds, or diseases, as well as environmental and risk assessment
    aspects

    related to pesticide use. Legislative limitations and the potential development
    of pesticide

    resistance are also taken into account.

    Robot module: The system can be integrated into autonomous robots equipped

    with sensors, cameras, and spraying equipment. Through the use of machine learning

    algorithms, these robots are trained to accurately identify and target pests,
    weeds, and

    diseases, optimizing the effectiveness of crop protection strategies.

    Monitoring module: AI is leveraged to monitor the effectiveness of crop protection

    strategies and make necessary adjustments in real time. This continuous monitoring

    ensures optimal performance and enables timely intervention when needed.

    User interface module: To facilitate communication between farmers, agricultural

    scientists, and other stakeholders, a user interface is provided. This interface
    presents the

    system’s ﬁndings and suggestions, allowing users to provide input and customize
    results

    according to their speciﬁc needs.

    The above system will have the modularity and agility to integrate other modules,
    for

    example, blockchain and NFT development platforms, with the aim of achieving the
    traceability

    of foods. The AI- and robotics-based crop protection systems hold immense potential
    to

    revolutionize crop protection practices while minimizing the detrimental impact
    of chemical

    use on the environment and human health. The system maximizes crop yields and
    promotes

    sustainable agricultural practices by enabling farmers to make informed decisions
    about

    their crop protection strategies. However, implementing this system requires extensive

    research and development to continually improve its efﬁciency and effectiveness.

    7. Discussion

    Crop protection is a critical aspect of agriculture that involves safeguarding
    crops

    against various threats, including pests, diseases, and weeds. Traditional crop
    protection

    methods involve using fungicides, insecticides, and herbicides, which can adversely
    affect

    the environment and human health. However, with the advent of robotics and artiﬁcial

    intelligence (AI), farmers now have new tools at their disposal to improve crop
    protection

    and increase yields. Robotic- and AI-based crop protection solutions involve using
    sensors,

    cameras, and machine learning algorithms to monitor crops and detect potential
    threats.

    These solutions offer several advantages over traditional methods, such as increased

    accuracy, efﬁciency, and cost-effectiveness. For example, robots equipped with
    sensors

    can detect pest infestations and apply targeted treatments only where necessary,
    reducing

    the number of chemicals used and minimizing the environmental impact. Furthermore,

    AI algorithms can analyze vast amounts of data on weather patterns, soil conditions,

    Machines 2023, 11, 774

    13 of 15

    and crop growth to predict potential threats and recommend preventive measures.
    This

    comprehensive approach enables farmers to make well-informed decisions regarding

    crop protection. It empowers them to effectively identify issues, choose the most
    suitable

    pesticide and application technology, and implement a reduced-risk crop protection
    scheme.

    Robotic- and AI-based solutions for crop protection also offer the potential for
    in-

    creased precision and automation, reducing the labor costs and time required for
    manual

    inspection and treatment. For example, drones equipped with cameras and sensors
    can

    survey large areas of crops quickly and efﬁciently, providing real-time data on
    crop health

    and potential threats. In addition, robotic- and AI-based solutions can provide
    farmers

    with real-time insights into the health and growth of their crops, enabling them
    to make

    more informed decisions and optimize crop management practices. For example, machine

    learning algorithms can analyze data on crop growth and identify patterns and
    trends

    that may not be immediately apparent to human observers. Despite the many advantages

    of robotic- and AI-based solutions for crop protection, some challenges still
    need to be

    addressed. For example, these solutions may require signiﬁcant investments in
    terms of

    hardware, software, and training. Additionally, there may be concerns about data
    privacy

    and security, particularly regarding sensitive information about crop yield and
    growth.

    In conclusion, robotic- and AI-based solutions have the potential to revolutionize
    crop

    protection and management, offering increased precision, efﬁciency, and cost-effectiveness.

    However, it will be essential to continue to develop these technologies and address
    any

    challenges to ensure that they are widely accessible to farmers and that they
    contribute to

    sustainable and ethical agriculture practices.

    8. Conclusions

    In conclusion, integrating robotic and artiﬁcial intelligence solutions into crop
    protec-

    tion is a promising avenue for addressing modern agriculture’s challenges. The
    potential ad-

    vantages of these technologies include increased precision, efﬁciency, and cost-effectiveness,

    as well as better monitoring and management of crop health. Looking to the future,
    several

    research areas could further enhance the effectiveness of these solutions. For
    example, the

    development of more advanced sensors and cameras, as well as improvements in machine

    learning algorithms, could enable more precise and accurate monitoring of crop
    health

    and growth. Additionally, advances in robotics could allow for more sophisticated
    and

    automated treatment of crops, reducing the need for manual labor. Another important
    area

    of future work is the integration of these technologies with existing agricultural
    practices

    and infrastructure, including relevant legislation, risk assessment, and environmental
    as-

    pects of AI modules. The availability of pesticide databases and alternative crop
    protection

    measures will help establish a robust machine learning model. This will require
    collabora-

    tion between farmers, agronomists, technology developers, and policymakers to
    ensure

    that the beneﬁts of these solutions are accessible to all and contribute to sustainable
    and

    ethical agriculture practices. Finally, addressing data privacy and security concerns
    will

    be essential, particularly regarding sensitive crop yield and growth information.
    This will

    require the development of robust data protection and governance frameworks and
    greater

    awareness among farmers and other stakeholders about the risks and beneﬁts of
    these

    technologies. Hence, the use of robotic and artiﬁcial intelligence solutions in
    crop protection

    has the potential to transform modern agriculture and ensure food security in
    the face of

    global challenges, such as climate change and population growth. Continued research

    and development in this area and integrating these technologies into existing
    agricultural

    practices will be crucial to realizing this potential and creating a more sustainable
    and

    resilient agricultural system for the future.

    \ demand for food worldwide,\nimproving productivity in farming procedures is\
    \ essential. Smart farming is a concept that emphasizes\nthe use of modern technologies\
    \ such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and artiﬁcial intelligence (AI)\nto enhance\
    \ productivity in farming practices. In a smart farming scenario, large amounts\
    \ of data\nare collected from diverse sources such as wireless sensor networks,\
    \ network-connected weather\nstations, monitoring cameras, and smartphones. These\
    \ data are valuable resources to be used in\ndata-driven services and decision\
    \ support systems (DSS) in farming applications. However, one\nof the major challenges\
    \ with these large amounts of agriculture data is their immense diversity in\n\
    terms of format and meaning. Moreover, the different services and technologies\
    \ in a smart farming\necosystem have limited capability to work together due to\
    \ the lack of standardized practices for data\nand system integration. These issues\
    \ create a signiﬁcant challenge in cooperative service provision,\ndata and technology\
    \ integration, and data-sharing practices. To address these issues, in this paper,\n\
    we propose the platform approach, a design approach intended to guide building\
    \ effective, reliable,\nand robust smart farming systems. The proposed platform\
    \ approach considers six requirements\nfor seamless integration, processing, and\
    \ use of farm data. These requirements in a smart farming\nplatform include interoperability,\
    \ reliability, scalability, real-time data processing, end-to-end security\nand\
    \ privacy, and standardized regulations and policies. A smart farming platform\
    \ that considers\nthese requirements leads to increased productivity, proﬁtability,\
    \ and performance of connected smart\nfarms. In this paper, we aim at introducing\
    \ the platform approach concept for smart farming and\nreviewing the requirements\
    \ for this approach.\nKeywords: smart farming; precise agriculture; platform approach;\

    \ food\nproduction should increase by 70% due to the expected growth in the world\
    \ population by\n2050. This population growth requires increasing productivity\
    \ using solutions that con-\nsider resource shortage and farm proﬁtability [2].\
    \ Employing information communication\ntechnology (ICT), smart technologies, in\
    \ addition to the rapid development of the Internet\nof Things (IoT) and artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence (AI) have led to digitalization in farming called\nsmart farming.\
    \ Smart farming is considered to be the fourth revolution in farming [3,4].\n\
    By managing inputs, such as fertilizers, pesticides, and animal feed, a smart\
    \ system can\nhelp farmers to reduce waste, employ less workforce, decrease overall\
    \ costs, and to reach a\nmore sustainable environmental impact to achieve higher\
    \ productivity [5,6]. According to\nthe Market and Markets report, USD 13.8 billion\
    \ was dedicated to the global smart farming\nmarket in 2020. Due to farmers’ needs\
    \ to increase yields, improve livestock production,\nand reduce management costs\
    \ to meet the growing demand for food, smart farming should\nexperience rapid\
    \ growth to USD 22 billion by 2025 [7].\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 838. https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture12060838\n\

    In a smart farming scenario, large amounts of real-time and high-resolution data\
    \ are\ngenerated from remote and automated sensor systems. The data can represent\
    \ different\naspects of farming, including but not limited to livestock, crops,\
    \ soil, and the environ-\nment [8]. The data range from time series to spatial\
    \ images, human experiences, and\nobservations collected via mobile smartphone\
    \ applications [9]. Such data can be analyzed\nto ﬁlter out invalid or wrong data\
    \ [2] and to compute personalized recommendations for\na farm to improve productivity\
    \ [10]. Different modern technologies can be utilized for\ndata generation and\
    \ data analysis in digital agriculture. IoT, AI, and cloud computing are\nexamples\
    \ of technologies that have recently been widely used in smart farming [11,12].\n\
    Although data-driven solutions have provided various beneﬁts in agriculture, data\
    \ integra-\ntion, processing, and usage processes and protocols are still prominent\
    \ challenges that need\nto be addressed [13]. Some of these challenges are limited\
    \ awareness and knowledge of dig-\nitalization [14], lack of standardization and\
    \ suitable management to cope with fragmented\nand heterogeneous data [15], lack\
    \ of high-quality data and proper analysis [16], privacy\nand security challenges\
    \ in an entire smart farming ecosystem [17], and lack of compliance\nwith uniform\
    \ regulations and policies [18].\nA uniﬁed solution that considers the requirements\
    \ in various stages of the data pro-\ncessing lifecycle can address various issues\
    \ in digital agriculture. Such a solution enhances\nawareness regarding the needs\
    \ and requirements of different data sources, technologies,\nprocesses, and protocols\
    \ (including policies). This solution assists the actors in smart\nfarming ecosystems\
    \ to provide their services and products to other parties in a more usable\nformat.\
    \ Moreover, this approach increases food safety, production, and sustainability\
    \ by\nproviding transparent and trustable data about every stage of the food chain.\
    \ In addition,\na uniﬁed solution provides an excellent opportunity for building\
    \ decision frameworks to\naggregate data from diverse sources and to provide high-quality\
    \ data-driven services. This\napproach also facilitates data sharing and multiparty\
    \ cooperation in farming applications,\nand thus, increases productivity and reduces\
    \ resource waste.\nIn this paper, we suggest the platform approach as a uniﬁed\
    \ solution that facilitates\ncooperation in smart farming applications. Furthermore,\
    \ this approach enforces relation-\nships between farmers and system providers\
    \ to track crop cycle information, livestock, and\ndairy production in a secure\
    \ manner for their decisions and data management.\nIn recent years, several platforms\
    \ have been proposed for smart farming applications.\nSmartFarmNet [2] is an IoT-based\
    \ platform that has been developed by a multi-disciplinary\nAustralian team to\
    \ automate the collection of environmental, irrigation, fertilization, and\nsoil\
    \ data. This platform integrates IoT devices, such as sensors, actuators, and\
    \ cloud servers\nfor storing and analysis of collected data. The presented results\
    \ in the paper showed that\nSmartFarmNet was capable of providing near real-time\
    \ query responses. Moreover, the\nauthors demonstrated that increasing the number\
    \ of sensors had a negligible impact on the\nperformance of the system, therefore,\
    \ the proposed platform was scalable. Mehdi et al. [19]\nproposed Smart Farming\
    \ Oriented BigData Architecture (SFOBA), a platform for big data\nprocessing that\
    \ provided real-time processing on acquired data from smart farm systems and\n\
    devices. In this study, the authors utilized the Star Schema Benchmark dataset\
    \ [20] to show\nhow the proposed platform could finish multidimensional queries\
    \ on 40 million rows of data\nin less than one second. Clements et al. [21] developed\
    \ an interactive digital tool that collected\ndata from different sources such\
    \ as the Key Indicators Mapping System (KIMS) and the Key\nIndicators Database\
    \ System (KIDS) both provided by the Food and Agriculture Organization\nof the\
    \ United Nations (FAO). The developed tool provided information regarding livestock\n\
    production, disease prediction, as well as provided the rules for risk assessment\
    \ at the\ncountry level.\nAnother ﬁeld in smart farming is smart dairy farming\
    \ which aims to utilize modern\nsmart technologies to satisfy the increasing demand\
    \ for quality dairy products, to reduce\nconsumed resources, and to decrease the\
    \ ecological footprint [22]. Taneja et al. [23] proposed\nSmartHerd, a platform\
    \ enabling data-driven dairy farming by analyzing available data and\nproviding\
    \ controls for farmers and other stakeholders. This platform has been deployed\n\
    Agriculture 2022, 12, 838\n3 of 18\nin Waterford, Ireland, and was developed to\
    \ gather and analyze data regarding dairy\ncattle. The presented platform is designed\
    \ to keep working when the internet connection\nis lost. The generated data in\
    \ this platform are stored locally and are shared on a cloud\ninfrastructure when\
    \ the internet connection is available.\nMost of the proposed platforms in smart\
    \ farming have focused on a speciﬁc aspect of\nsmart farming such as crop production\
    \ recommendations [2], big data technologies [19],\ndata transformation [19] reliability\
    \ [24], and business model [6]. With the increasing need to\ncollect, integrate,\
    \ analyze, and manage large amounts of data generated at farms, effective\nfarm\
    \ data processing continues to be a major hurdle for the adoption and success\
    \ of\ndigital agriculture solutions. Despite the need, the existing studies have\
    \ not provided a\nholistically designed approach by considering different requirements\
    \ for smart farming\napplications. To ﬁll this gap, in this paper, we propose\
    \ a design thinking approach, which\nwe refer to as the “platform approach”, for\
    \ smart farming data processing. This approach\nencourages consideration of six\
    \ core requirements when designing, implementing, and\ntesting smart farming solutions.\
    \ These requirements are interoperability of data, processes,\nand technologies;\
    \ reliability to ensure that a data source is valid and available; scalability\n\
    in terms of the capability of the platform to be extended to larger applications;\
    \ real-time\ndata processing to enable timely access to data and services; protection\
    \ of infrastructure\nand smart farming assets (privacy and security); and ﬁnally,\
    \ compliance with policies and\nregulation. The proposed approach facilitates\
    \ cooperation among different parties in smart\nfarming ecosystems and enables\
    \ these actors to make the most use of available data sources.\nThe rest of this\
    \ paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, the core components of data\nprocessing\
    \ in smart farming systems are described; in Section 3, we discuss the challenges\n\
    and requirements in smart farming systems; then, in Section 4, we investigate\
    \ the main\nrequirements and related solutions in a smart farming platform; ﬁnally,\
    \ in Section 5, we\nconclude the paper with a summary of the platform approach\
    \ and some future insights.\n2. The Core Components of Data Processing in Smart\
    \ Farming Systems\nTo improve smart farming data processing through the integration\
    \ of various systems,\nin this paper, we propose the concept of the platform approach,\
    \ which is a design approach\nfor data processing. The smart farming platform\
    \ approach allows farmers, researchers,\ntechnology providers, and all other stakeholders\
    \ to have a standard and reliable solution\nto collect and share information,\
    \ resources, and experiences to improve the productivity\nand performance of smart\
    \ farming solutions. We demonstrate an overview of the main\ncomponents of smart\
    \ farming data processing in Figure 1 in ﬁve main layers. This abstract\nplatform\
    \ can shed light on the components of the smart farming application platform,\n\
    deﬁning the main tasks and core components for data processing in these systems.\n\
    According to Figure 1, in the data acquisition stage, data are collected from\
    \ diverse\nsources, such as farmers, sensors, and satellites, as well as external\
    \ databases such as\nweather and climate data. The collected data from these different\
    \ sources can be in different\nformats that are not compatible to be stored in\
    \ a unique database. In addition, some\ncollected data may contain incomplete\
    \ data, missed values, outliers [25], and anomalous\ninstances [26]. To address\
    \ these problems, in the data preparation stage, best practices\nfor data preprocessing\
    \ can be used to prepare data for further analysis. These practices\ninclude standardizing\
    \ data to a predeﬁned format, identifying and deleting duplicated\ndata, handling\
    \ the gaps in generated data, and validating data sources and contents. Addi-\n\
    tionally, the collected data from different sources can be stored in a common\
    \ infrastructure\nand can be integrated with other data sources that are collected\
    \ from diverse smart farm-\ning systems. These methods assist in ensuring data\
    \ consistency, completeness [27], and\naccuracy [28]. The components in the second\
    \ and the third layers are highly correlated,\nand many of the smart farming data\
    \ processing functions can be assigned to both layers.\nThe data processing layer\
    \ components are the brains of smart farming [29]. Mathematical\nmodeling, statistical\
    \ methods, or AI methods are used to analyze and extract knowledge\nfrom farm\
    \ data. Machine learning (a branch of AI) consists of intelligent techniques to\
    \ make\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 838\n4 of 18\nautomated decisions with limited human\
    \ involvement. Machine learning can perform\nrapid optimizations, classiﬁcations\
    \ [30], predictions, and recommendations and add value\nto the entire system [31].\
    \ For instance, SomaDetect Inc. of Fredericton [13], utilizes machine\nlearning\
    \ for identifying individual cows. This system also monitors the cows to detect\n\
    disease symptoms through data collected from sensors at milking stations on dairy\
    \ farms.\nAs another example, AirSurf-Lettuce is an open-source analytic platform\
    \ that uses machine\nlearning to categorize iceberg lettuces to improve the actual\
    \ yield and crop marketability\nbefore harvesting [32]. Model deployment in the\
    \ context of machine learning refers to\nthe application of generalizing a model\
    \ to predict new items in the system. Prediction is\naccording to estimating the\
    \ outcomes for unseen data that can help to provide predictions.\nFor example,\
    \ the growth prediction in plants helps farmers to decide about harvest time\n\
    and plan for the required workforce. Forecasting is a kind of prediction about\
    \ the future\nusing time-series data. An example of forecasting in smart farming\
    \ is weather forecasting\nusing temporal information to plan for irrigation [33].\n\

    \ stage includes system monitoring, rule management, and model\nmetadata management\
    \ to provide the results and recommendations through the deployed\nmodel. Metadata\
    \ (data about data) is provided to establish a common understanding of\nthe meaning\
    \ of data. For example, the available metadata about automatic milking devices\n\
    can help farmers to use the proper estimators to predict the milking duration.\
    \ These data\ncan help smart farming actors such as farmers and growers during\
    \ the decision-making\nprocess. Some examples are decisions about disease prediction,\
    \ pesticide control, and\nwater management. In the last stage of smart farming\
    \ applications, end-users, i.e., farmers,\nfarming service providers, agriculture\
    \ researchers, and governments access the system\nresults through services. System\
    \ monitoring can audit the entire system and provide\nfeedback to optimize the\
    \ predictors and to improve decision making. In addition, rule\nmanagement can\
    \ check the compliance of decisions against available rules.\nSince trustworthiness\
    \ is a core requirement to ensure system adoption and use, it is\nnecessary to\
    \ consider security and privacy concerns in all communications and end-to-end\n\
    in the platform. Moreover, the data workﬂow should comply with the available policy\
    \ and\nregulations in smart farming. Application programming interfaces (APIs)\
    \ are common\nmethods for the integration of different components and resources\
    \ (e.g., data sources, legal\nprocesses, and policy protocols) in a platform approach.\n\
    Agriculture 2022, 12, 838\n5 of 18\n3. Challenges and Requirements in Smart Farming\n\
    The platform approach suggests designing smart farming services using platform\n\
    structures that can be integrated through APIs or other methods to build effective,\
    \ reliable,\nand robust systems. This approach is also aimed at providing a common\
    \ understanding\nand semantics among smart farming actors to collaborate in data-sharing\
    \ practices and\ncooperative service provision. In Section 2, we presented an\
    \ abstract overview of such a\nplatform as well as the main components of data\
    \ processing in smart farming systems. In\nthis section, we discuss the challenges\
    \ in smart farming applications and convey the major\nrequirements that any agricultural\
    \ platform should have to address these challenges.\nIn agriculture, data are\
    \ highly heterogeneous for different reasons such as type, format,\nand intent\
    \ of data, different protocols of devices, and the methods of collecting data.\
    \ For\nexample, poultry stakeholders are interested in monitoring the daily behavior\
    \ of birds, such\nas their movement and feeding patterns, to predict the possibility\
    \ of a disease outbreak\nin the early stages. A major challenge in such an application\
    \ is combining heterogeneous\ndata collected from different sensors in smart poultry\
    \ farms. In addition to collecting and\nprocessing data, aggregating diverse data\
    \ among various farms can improve the prediction\noutcome. However, lack of interoperability\
    \ among data, technologies, and data processes is\na signiﬁcant barrier to reaching\
    \ this goal. A similar challenge may arise when farmers aim\nto equip their farms\
    \ with new IoT devices. As devices from different technology providers\ndo not\
    \ follow a unique protocol, this limitation restricts farmers from adding new\
    \ digital\ntools and devices to their smart farming network.\nIn the context of\
    \ smart farming, interoperability refers to the ability of two or more\ndifferent\
    \ systems, services, and components (i.e., software components and IoT devices)\
    \ to\nbe able to work together to exchange information, facilitate processes,\
    \ integrate technology\nsolutions, and comply with policies and legal requirements.\
    \ There are four categories of\ninteroperability including semantic/data interoperability,\
    \ technology or system interop-\nerability, operational interoperability, and\
    \ legal interoperability [34]. For data/semantic\ninteroperability, the entities\
    \ should mutually agree on the meaning, content, and context\nof data exchange\
    \ and use [35]. Interoperability improves the ﬂexibility of smart farming\nnetworks\
    \ as well as enables farmers to collaborate through data sharing and enhance\n\
    their farm practices. An important aspect of interoperability is standardization.\
    \ In the\ncontext of data processing, without mechanisms to take data from diverse\
    \ sources of digital\nagriculture solutions, it would be extremely resource based\
    \ and time-consuming to make\nthe most use of data. Using processes and best practices\
    \ that convert data and information\nto harmonized formats is critical to enabling\
    \ data sharing and integration practices and\ncollaborative decision making.\n\
    Alongside interoperability in smart farming devices and systems, controlling data\
    \ reli-\nability is a major requirement in a smart farm platform. Data reliability,\
    \ sometimes referred\nto as data quality, is deﬁned as the extent to which the\
    \ data and its source are trustworthy,\nunfailing, authentic, genuine, and representative\
    \ of the problem [36]. Reliability can be\nevaluated at different levels, such\
    \ as on-farm and off-farm levels. From an on-farm point of\nview, it is essential\
    \ to make sure the data generation is valid and stable. A smart device\nthat is\
    \ physically damaged, or an issue in network connection might lead to invalid\
    \ and\nunstable data generation. From an off-farm perspective, a smart farming\
    \ platform should\nensure the farmers that the data and algorithms are valid and\
    \ trustable. Data quality issues\nare also likely to arise in the integration\
    \ process as the quality of all data sources cannot\nbe veriﬁed [37,38]. Wrong\
    \ decisions originating from unreliable data in decision-making\nprocesses cost\
    \ agricultural businesses billions per year [39].\nScalability is another requirement\
    \ that should be considered while designing a smart\nfarming platform [40]. Scalability\
    \ in smart farming refers to the adaptability of a system\nto increase the capacity,\
    \ for example, the number of technology devices such as sensors\nand actuators,\
    \ while enabling timely analysis [41]. Shortcomings of scalability in a smart\n\
    farming architecture, in the context of data processing, would lead to weak system\
    \ perfor-\nmance. For instance, integration with other devices and applications\
    \ may not be possible if\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 838\n6 of 18\nscalability requirements\
    \ are not embedded by design. It has been recommended to consider\nthe possibility\
    \ of growth in size and diversity of applications of smart farming systems\nfrom\
    \ the initial stages of system design [42]. As an illustration, consider a large\
    \ poultry\nproduction that owns farms in different locations. This company needs\
    \ a platform to build a\nscalable business by integrating the supply chain from\
    \ feed to hatcheries and poultry farms\nto distribution [43]. These poultry farms\
    \ may have different sensors and acquire various\ntypes of technologies to collect\
    \ data in sizes, formats, content, and complexities [17,44]. The\ncompany should\
    \ be able to expand data processing, network bandwidth, and other compu-\ntation\
    \ resources to be able to utilize data collected in these farms. If this need\
    \ for resource\ngrowth is not considered in the design of the system, the company\
    \ cannot easily expand\ntheir system to process and use other data sources. Platforms\
    \ for smart farming should\nconsider scalability as a core requirement to enable\
    \ growth and future needs for integration.\nMoreover, in smart farming systems,\
    \ we need fast and accurate decisions and actions.\nThus, we need platforms that\
    \ enable farmers to deliver proper actions at the right time.\nReal-time data\
    \ analytics is deﬁned as the ability to analyze large volumes of streaming data\n\
    when they are created or stored [45]. For instance, in the case that a farmer\
    \ decides to sell\ntheir products or buy supplies, a long waiting time for getting\
    \ access to data and making\ndecisions might lead to losing a bargain, or incorrectly\
    \ offering an estimation originated\nfrom outdated data. Real-time processing\
    \ is an approach to capture, process, and export\ndata promptly [46,47]. Furthermore,\
    \ real-time data processing enables smart farming actors\nto take proper decisions\
    \ at the right time which leads to minimizing risks and undesirable\nconsequences\
    \ [48]. A smart farming platform can also facilitate real-time processing as a\n\
    requirement for reinforcing farming practices and preparing farmers against unexpected\n\
    circumstances [45]. To achieve real-time data processing, it is also necessary\
    \ to collect the\ndata in real time. The results acquired based on analyzing old\
    \ data can cause inaccurate\ndecisions, while real-time data facilitates real-time\
    \ decisions and actions [46].\nSimilar to any other smart platform, a smart farming\
    \ platform should bring security\nand privacy to the core of attention and provide\
    \ sufﬁcient protection mechanisms. Mod-\nern technologies form an ecosystem in\
    \ which connected devices are accessible remotely,\nallowing adversaries to plan\
    \ cyberattacks. The attackers might aim to steal information or\ncarry out disruptive\
    \ actions on the smart farming systems [49]. For example, Yang et al.\nillustrated\
    \ how adversaries used IoT devices in IT infrastructure to compromise security\
    \ [4].\nAs an illustration, a malicious actor can get access to a farm’s data\
    \ using an unsecured\nsmart device and steal information about the products, ﬁnancial\
    \ decisions, and future plans.\nThe intruder can also damage the products and\
    \ equipment. Because of the availability\nof diverse data sources in smart farming\
    \ systems, including personal and business data,\nprivacy is another paramount\
    \ concern. Smart farming systems should provide mechanisms\nto ensure security\
    \ requirements and data protection. These practices must protect data\nend-to-end\
    \ and in different data processing stages, from data collection to data-driven\n\
    service provision.\nRegulations for agricultural practices affect the design and\
    \ development of smart\nfarming technologies. For instance, farmers’ concerns\
    \ about data sharing and privacy\nhave been discussed in recent studies [50,51].\
    \ Farmers are not convinced that the available\npolicies to protect their intellectual\
    \ property, business proﬁt share, and privacy are sufﬁcient.\nThere are also concerns\
    \ about the lack of compliance with privacy best practices and farm\ndata agreements\
    \ by the technology providers [52]. To address these concerns and build\ntrust,\
    \ there is a need to establish standards and best practices that mandate the rights\
    \ and\nresponsibilities of different actors in smart farming systems. There is\
    \ also the need to set\nstandards for data-sharing practices and to apply policies\
    \ to determine accountability and\npenalties in the case of possible disputes.\
    \ Other regulations related to food safety, supply\nchain management, disease\
    \ monitoring, and other applications can also impact agriculture\ndata management\
    \ and processing. These policies can be renewed to be applicable to new\nand emerging\
    \ agri-food needs and technologies. Policy requirements can be embedded\ninto\
    \ technologies for monitoring, compliance, and sustainability purposes.\nAgriculture\
    \ 2022, 12, 838\n7 of 18\nIn summary, as is demonstrated in Figure 2, we recommend\
    \ consideration of a plat-\nform approach that facilitates six requirements for\
    \ smart farming data processing. These\nrequirements enable seamless integration\
    \ of data, system, and processes with the end-user\nin mind. They include interoperability\
    \ to provide compatibility among different compo-\nnents of the platform; real-time\
    \ processing to generate fast and accurate information for\ndecision making; scalability\
    \ that enables the platform to extend the entities and resources;\nreliability\
    \ to assure accessing valid and up-to-date data; ensuring security and privacy\
    \ to\npreserve the system safety and conﬁdentiality; and, ﬁnally compliance with\
    \ the related\npolicies and regulations in smart farming. A platform that satisﬁes\
    \ all these requirements\ncan enhance farming practices, and therefore, can increase\
    \ productivity, proﬁtability, and\nperformance while decreasing resource waste.\n\
    \ \nbuild trust, there is a need to establish standards and best practices that\
    \ mandate the rights \nand responsibilities of different actors in smart farming\
    \ systems. There is also the need to \nset standards for data-sharing practices\
    \ and to apply policies to determine accountability \nand penalties in the case\
    \ of possible disputes. Other regulations related to food safety, \nsupply chain\
    \ management, disease monitoring, and other applications can also impact \nagriculture\
    \ data management and processing. These policies can be renewed to be appli-\n\
    cable to new and emerging agri-food needs and technologies. Policy requirements\
    \ can be \nembedded into technologies for monitoring, compliance, and sustainability\
    \ purposes. \nIn summary, as is demonstrated in Figure 2, we recommend consideration\
    \ of a plat-\nform approach that facilitates six requirements for smart farming\
    \ data processing. These \nrequirements enable seamless integration of data, system,\
    \ and processes with the end-\nuser in mind. They include interoperability to\
    \ provide compatibility among different com-\nponents of the platform; real-time\
    \ processing to generate fast and accurate information \nfor decision making;\
    \ scalability that enables the platform to extend the entities and re-\nsources;\
    \ reliability to assure accessing valid and up-to-date data; ensuring security\
    \ and \nprivacy to preserve the system safety and confidentiality; and, finally\
    \ compliance with the \nrelated policies and regulations in smart farming. A platform\
    \ that satisfies all these re-\nquirements can enhance farming practices, and\
    \ therefore, can increase productivity, prof-\nitability, and performance while\
    \ decreasing resource waste. \n \nFigure 2. Platform requirements for data processing.\
    \ \nFigure 2. Platform requirements for data processing.\n4. Requirements, Discussion\
    \ and Solutions\nIn Section 3, we recommended six major requirements to be considered\
    \ in the design\nof smart farming platforms. We suggest that these requirements\
    \ are necessary for any\nplatform that aims to provide fast and robust services\
    \ in a smart farming ecosystem. In\nthe following, we investigate these requirements\
    \ and the solutions to address them in the\nplatform approach.\n4.1. Interoperability\n\
    Currently, there is an extensive number of digital solutions including software\
    \ tools\nand services that are used in smart farming. This growing trend has resulted\
    \ in the\ngeneration of heterogeneous data from multiple protocols and communication\
    \ technologies\nwith different formats and semantics. However, data generated\
    \ by precision farming tools\nare not portable and cannot be integrated among\
    \ smart farming systems. Interoperability\namong technical software tools, hardware,\
    \ or processes/protocols is relatively limited\noften because of the lack of established\
    \ standards [53]. Interoperability requirements cut\nacross various components\
    \ of smart farming technologies (Figure 1) from collecting data\nwith varying\
    \ accessibility rules, data integration across multiple sectors/devices, and data\n\
    processing and protection regulation for data governance and data access.\nInteroperability\
    \ can be viewed from legal, organizational or operational, semantic,\nand technical\
    \ dimensions [34]. Legal interoperability involves ensuring the integration of\n\
    smart farming platforms under various legal frameworks including food policies,\
    \ privacy\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 838\n8 of 18\npolicies and procedures, and data\
    \ agreements, to enable data exchange. In a smart farming\nsystem, data could\
    \ be combined from various sources, resulting in integrated datasets. This\nintegration\
    \ should be performed in accordance with the farm data agreements. To address\n\
    legal interoperability requirements in smart farming, the RDA-CODATA principles\
    \ can\nbe used [34]. These principles are: facilitating the authorized access\
    \ to and re-use of data,\ndeciding who has access to and is responsible for the\
    \ data, managing the legal interests,\nexplaining the rights clearly, and promoting\
    \ harmonization of rights in the data. These\nprinciples can be embedded into\
    \ the farm data processing platform and integration can be\nenabled through application\
    \ programming interfaces (APIs).\nOrganizational interoperability is concerned\
    \ with agricultural actors’ capacity to\naccept and utilize services from other\
    \ organizations to collaborate effectively [54]. This\nis dependent on the degree\
    \ to which farms’ processes, responsibilities, and roles are\nharmonized toward\
    \ shared objectives and strategies in the agricultural systems to make\nservices\
    \ more accessible, easily identiﬁable, and user focused. To address the organizational\n\
    interoperability requirements, farm business processes and exchanged data need\
    \ to be\nintegrated, aligned, and documented using a commonly agreed modeling\
    \ method [55].\nSemantic interoperability ensures that the precise meaning and\
    \ format of the shared\ndata are understood and preserved. In existing smart farming\
    \ ecosystems, data are col-\nlected from fragmented systems in varying formats\
    \ and meanings. To tackle the lack of\nsemantic interoperability in data processing,\
    \ it is necessary to describe all data elements by\ndeveloping vocabularies and\
    \ schema to ensure that all communicating agricultural parties\nunderstand the\
    \ data in the same way. The solutions for improving semantic interoperability\n\
    in smart farming are standardization, metadata, and connecting each data variable\
    \ to a\ncommon language, in the form of taxonomies and ontologies [56]. Semantic\
    \ interoperability\nissues in smart farming data processes can be solved by using\
    \ standardized languages\nsuch as agroXML [57] which is an XML dialect for describing\
    \ farm production processes\nas well as the real-world objects required in conducting\
    \ these processes. For semantic\ninteroperability enhancement, a smart farming\
    \ application can leverage metadata that\ndescribes original data, allowing the\
    \ user to make the best decision possible about how to\nuse it. Metadata is generated\
    \ to add meaning and context to data values and to establish a\ncommon understanding\
    \ of the meaning and semantics of the data. Metadata enables correct\nand proper\
    \ use and interpretation of the data by the owners and users [58]. Furthermore,\
    \ it\nalso enables farm machines to comprehend data by offering models and eliminating\
    \ ambi-\nguity [58]. For example, in the modeling and simulation of a decision\
    \ support platform in\nsmart farming, there is a need for a method to detect conﬂict\
    \ between system components\nand concepts of the model. Metadata is used to address\
    \ the interoperability of such systems\nby capturing information about model concepts\
    \ which allows software agents to reason in\nan unambiguous and machine-readable\
    \ form [59].\nData interoperability is considerably resolved in smart farming\
    \ when metadata is\nstandardized, and common language deﬁnitions are used. Such\
    \ standards are deﬁned\nand promoted by standard agencies such as the International\
    \ Standards Organisation\n(ISO) [60]. The Agricultural Information Management\
    \ Standards (AIMS) [61], the Agricul-\ntural Metadata Element Set (AgMES) [62],\
    \ and Agrovoc [63] are three notable metadata\ninitiatives in the agriculture\
    \ area [53]. Moreover, ontologies and taxonomies can enable\nbetter interoperability\
    \ by allowing data to be linked at the semantic level. Taxonomy\naids in the interpretation\
    \ of relationships between data entities and the categorization of\ndata [64].\
    \ Ontology explains the structural complexities of databases as well as the semantic\n\
    relationships among data variables collected in databases [10]. Several ontologies\
    \ such as\nFoodWiki, Agrovoc, and FoodOn have been proposed to extract the semantics\
    \ of food and\nagricultural data to share and reuse agriculture knowledge. In\
    \ addition, sensor ontologies\nsuch as sensor node ontology [65], and sensor-data\
    \ ontology [66] are used for semantic\ninteroperability of data collected from\
    \ IoT devices. The goal of these ontologies is to identify\nessential elements\
    \ of sensor data and to model resources, services, and geographical data\nto ease\
    \ data access for users.\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 838\n9 of 18\nAnother aspect of\
    \ interoperability is technical interoperability, which refers to the\ncapacity\
    \ of two or more technical agricultural platforms, infrastructures, services,\
    \ or proto-\ncols to easily integrate and enable process and data ﬂow [54]. This\
    \ concept is fundamental\nto software and hardware compatibility. For example,\
    \ interoperability is required among\nfarm machines, software, IoT devices, and\
    \ sensors. If the data processing modules do not\nrecognize the data format collected\
    \ by the combined harvester, the IoT will be of little\nuse in terms of assisting\
    \ decision making. Technical interoperability often can be satisﬁed\nby selecting\
    \ and implementing the proper software and/or internet interface (API) and\nprotocols,\
    \ as well as standardized content encodings for transmission [67]. Technical inter-\n\
    operability could be satisﬁed by creating a decentralized network of existing\
    \ systems to\nenable the exchange of data in smart farming processes. Each system\
    \ could be independent\nand built upon its own technical infrastructure. The ATLAS\
    \ initiative is one of the projects\nthat developed such an open technical interoperable\
    \ network involving stakeholders from\ndiverse agricultural domains by using open\
    \ technical speciﬁcation. This project aims to\nprovide a distributed service-oriented\
    \ platform that enables some tasks such as watering\nmanagement, soil management,\
    \ and behavioral analysis of livestock. This framework\ninvolves all actors in\
    \ the food chain, enhancing the process from farm to fork.\nInteroperability is\
    \ made possible by data standards that allow the sharing and ex-\nchange of data.\
    \ In the absence of standardization of data, processing data from heteroge-\n\
    neous and incompatible sources is challenging and often inefﬁcient. Data standardization\
    \ is\na key step toward data interoperability to promote data quality, data sharing,\
    \ data reusabil-\nity, and to optimize data usage. The standardization process\
    \ of data, processes, policies,\nand concepts is critical in ensuring all types\
    \ of interoperability. This goal may be realized by\nwell-deﬁned and well-established\
    \ protocols and regulations that facilitate the integration\nof multiple data\
    \ sources and external knowledge-based services given by stakeholders and\npartners.\
    \ Due to the complexity of data standardization, data harmonization [68] can be\n\
    used as an alternative solution. Data harmonization is the process of merging\
    \ different data\nsources into an unambiguous, integrated entity record to be\
    \ used in the system and to feed\nthe processes of a system [69]. The main difference\
    \ between data standardization and data\nharmonization comes from the level of\
    \ strictness in standards. On the one hand, the aim of\ndata standardization is\
    \ to make the data clear and consistent. It should be “clear” to ensure\nthat\
    \ data can be easily understood by individuals who are not involved in data processing,\n\
    and consistent to ensure that relevant data can be recognized using common terms\
    \ and\nformats. Data harmonization, on the other hand, is the process of merging\
    \ different data\nsources into an unambiguous, integrated entity fromat to be\
    \ used in the system and to feed\nthe processes of a system [69].\n4.2. Reliability\n\
    Reliability is a crucial foundation for designing data-driven services across\
    \ smart\nfarming ecosystems. The reliability of data-driven systems depends on\
    \ effective processes,\ndata, and technologies [70]. As a major requirement, reliability\
    \ should be considered in\nall stages of smart farming, from data acquisition\
    \ to data preparation and model building.\nReliability can be considered from\
    \ different aspects such as data reliability and technology\nreliability. The\
    \ main components of data reliability are data consistency, data complete-\nness\
    \ [27,71,72], and data accuracy [28]. Consistency as the main component of reliability\
    \ [2]\nrefers to keeping data concepts, value domains, and formats unchanged.\
    \ Changes to farm\ndata might take place while processing, moving through networks,\
    \ or sharing between\napplications [28,72]. Data completeness is about the availability\
    \ of all necessary data for\ndecision making [72]. In other words, the deﬁciency\
    \ of a component should not impact the\naccuracy and integrity of data [28]. Data\
    \ completeness in smart farming does not mean that\nall data attributes must be\
    \ present; rather, important data attributes and optional ones need\nto be decided\
    \ for selection. Accuracy refers to the extent to which recorded data reﬂect the\n\
    true state of source information [28,73]. The values stored by a precision agriculture\
    \ system\nmay be inaccurate or wrong. This issue can be due to unreliable or broken\
    \ sensors, lost\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 838\n10 of 18\ninformation, and failed\
    \ transmissions [74]. The inaccurate data can lead to a risk of missing\nevents\
    \ and hard interpretations [74].\nIn addition to data reliability, smart farming\
    \ platforms require robust and reliable\ntechnologies such as high speed and reliable\
    \ internet connection [75]. The physical safety\nof IoT devices for precision\
    \ agriculture systems should be ensured in different environ-\nmental conditions\
    \ to avoid communication failures. IoT data analytics should process data\naccurately\
    \ and reliably to enable decision-makers to react quickly to emerging issues and\n\
    changing conditions [76].\nBecause agricultural data cover a wide range of heterogeneous\
    \ and unstructured\nsources, simple ratios can be used to measure the percentage\
    \ of data elements that meets\nspeciﬁc rules [77]. To manage information structure\
    \ in a database, Blake et al. [78] suggested\nusing parsing techniques. Using\
    \ this method, the quality of sensor data, as an example,\nwas calculated by comparing\
    \ it with data coming from multiple reference sensors, existing\nhistorical data,\
    \ or an alternate data source. There are, however, several challenges to using\n\
    this approach. For example, the quality of the reference sensors is not always\
    \ guaranteed,\nhistorical data might not be available, and there might be additional\
    \ costs using alternate\ndata sources. Performing some tests and preprocessing\
    \ on the aggregated data from sensors\nand other sources is recommended to raise\
    \ data reliability in smart farms. For example,\noutlier detection can help to\
    \ detect faulty devices or discern the unreliable data exchanged\nwith other farms.\n\
    4.3. Scalability\nScalability is another requirement that should be considered\
    \ in a smart farming plat-\nform. Scalability refers to the ability to increase\
    \ available resources and system capability\nwithout the need to go through a\
    \ major system redesign or implementation. As an illustra-\ntion, in Figure 1,\
    \ we can increase the capacity for data processing by increasing the cloud\nresources\
    \ in the second layer and computation resources in the third layer.\nThe challenges\
    \ related to scalability in smart farming fall into two categories: capacity\n\
    and performance [79]. Scaling capacity refers to the ability to add new nodes\
    \ or resources\nto the system [41]. Scaling performance is the ability to improve\
    \ performance or to keep\nthe performance identical while expanding capacity.\
    \ The fundamental bottleneck that\nmay affect system performance may be caused\
    \ by different deployment conﬁgurations\nof various components [80]. Other challenges\
    \ of scalability are identity management\nand access control, security [81], privacy\
    \ [44], governance, and fault tolerance [81]. Since\nfarming data generation is\
    \ rapidly increasing every day, such data are too large to be stored\non a single\
    \ node. A fundamental solution to address this need is distributing data collection\n\
    mechanisms across multiple nodes. For instance, Zhou et al. [82] employed Hadoop\
    \ to\nprocess and store 1.44 million data records for daily temperature monitoring.\
    \ Since most\nsmart farming data are small ﬁles that lead to many small ﬁles,\
    \ Hadoop cannot be effective\nwithout a distributed system equipped with a high-performance\
    \ computing system. To\naddress this problem, the Hadoop Distributed File System\
    \ (HDFS) has been designed to\nprocess large (and small size) datasets.\nUsing\
    \ cloud computing technology in a smart farming platform is another solution\n\
    that can address scalability challenges related to capacity due to ﬂexible and\
    \ robust data\ncollection, management, and processing capabilities [83]. Cloud\
    \ computing provides a\nhigh level of ﬂexibility by providing remote services\
    \ for monitoring and managing farm\ndata. Moreover, these services can provide\
    \ on-demand storage and computation resources\nwith no need for on-farm hardware\
    \ installation [84]. The data stored in the cloud systems\nare usually distributed\
    \ in the data storage platforms supported by backup mechanisms.\nThe data-driven\
    \ services are ﬁnally offered by web services accessible through diverse\ntools,\
    \ including laptops, tablets, and smartphones in the last stage of smart farming\
    \ tasks,\nas shown in Figure 1. SmartFarmNet [2] is an example of a scalable platform\
    \ that utilizes\ncloud computing technology to provide a scalable solution for\
    \ smart farming.\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 838\n11 of 18\nDespite several beneﬁts\
    \ of employing cloud technology in smart farming systems, the\nchallenges such\
    \ as latency, security, and privacy issues in transferring a large amount of\n\
    data to the cloud are still persistent. To address these issues, the use of edge\
    \ computing\nat the network’s edge has been recommended [78,85]. Edge computing\
    \ is a technology\nthat aims to process data at the edge of the network, near\
    \ the source of the data in order\nto reduce the transmitted data to the cloud\
    \ servers, as well as to decrease the workload\non the centralized cloud computing\
    \ servers. In addition, edge computing can leverage\nthe scalability of cloud\
    \ computing resources by taking advantage of both cloud and edge\ncomputing and\
    \ decreasing the volume of data transfer. Having an edge-based ecosystem\nwith\
    \ the right APIs and tools to integrate various data sources can ensure the availability\n\
    and real-time processing for users. An example of using edge computing in agriculture\n\
    is the platform Zamora-Izquierdo et al. [24] who proposed another real-world platform\n\
    that utilized edge technology to handle the issues in hydroponics farming. This\
    \ platform\nwas implemented in Spain to evaluate the water consumption and procedures\
    \ related to\ntomato cultivation. Digital tools also have been used in livestock\
    \ production and health\nmanagement. Although edge computing increases scalability\
    \ in a system, it increases\nconcerns regarding the heterogeneity of the utilized\
    \ devices in a network. Because this\ntechnology utilizes diverse software and\
    \ hardware products in different layers of the\nnetwork, the performance of the\
    \ system is highly correlated with the compatibility of the\nused components.\
    \ Ning et al. [86] discussed the heterogeneity issues in edge computing\nand the\
    \ solutions to address this problem.\n4.4. Near Real-Time Data Processing and\
    \ Decision Making\nSimilar to many other emerging real-world applications, smart\
    \ farming applications\nneed real-time processing of streaming big data [87,88].\
    \ Real-time data lead to real-time\ndecisions and actions [48]. In a smart farming\
    \ system, making fast and accurate decisions\nis a major goal. To achieve this\
    \ goal, we need mechanisms to collect and process the\ndiverse available data\
    \ sources in real time. These data are generated by different technolo-\ngies\
    \ including but not limited to IoT, robotics, drones, climate forecasting services,\
    \ and\nsmartphones. SFOBA [19] is a platform for big data processing which provides\
    \ real-time\nprocessing in many domains of agriculture. This platform integrates\
    \ different data sources,\ndata modeling, and software products to provide real-time\
    \ data analysis in farming ap-\nplications. Al-Thani et al. [89] investigated\
    \ the set-up process for the use of a drone in\nmonitoring sheep livestock. They\
    \ also used image processing and ML models in a real ﬁeld\napplication. With the\
    \ massive number of pictures from drones and new computer vision\nand deep learning\
    \ models, it is possible to predict diseases and pests through greenhouses\nand\
    \ farms. These technologies also can be used to estimate plant traits in real\
    \ time [90]. For\nexample, in the autonomous greenhouse, it is possible to develop\
    \ a model to estimate the\nleaf area, dry weight, and fresh weight of the lettuce\
    \ [91]. Real-time data lead to real-time\ndecisions and actions [48]. For example,\
    \ agile actions can be carried out in sudden changes\nin operational conditions\
    \ or other circumstances such as weather changes and disease\nprediction alerts.\n\
    In addition, the use of IoT, cloud computing, remote sensing, biotechnology, and\n\
    robotics is increasing in smart farming [48], transforming traditional into smart\
    \ farming.\nThese technologies can establish the networking of machines and control\
    \ farm activities\nautomatically and in real time [92]. As discussed, storing\
    \ data at intermediate points at the\n“edge” of the network rather than always\
    \ at the central server or data center leads to faster\ndata processing and a\
    \ shorter response time critical for real-time processing [93].\nTo analyze the\
    \ large agriculture data collected from ﬁelds and reveal hidden patterns of\n\
    interest from them, there is a need to develop forecasting models such as disease,\
    \ pests, and\nyield prediction models. Machine learning models that were mostly\
    \ used in the prediction\ninclude artiﬁcial neural network, support vector machine,\
    \ and logistic regression [76].\nThese algorithms can be integrated with data\
    \ analytics tools such as Map-Reduce and\nSpark for real-time analysis and better\
    \ performance [19,76].\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 838\n12 of 18\nUtilizing edge computing\
    \ provides another opportunity for data processing which is\nfederated learning\
    \ that can address a major concern in data processing for smart farming,\nwhich\
    \ is data sharing. Many farmers prefer to keep their data private, decreasing\
    \ their mo-\ntivation to participate in collaborative learning activities. Alternatively,\
    \ utilizing federated\nlearning, the learning model is distributed to the edge\
    \ nodes without sharing the farms’\ndata with a central unit in the system. This\
    \ approach reduces data privacy concerns and\nencourages farmers to participate\
    \ in cooperative learning processes.\n4.5. Security and Privacy\nSecurity and\
    \ privacy mechanisms are important requirements that should be consid-\nered throughout\
    \ a smart farming platform [4]. There are several solutions to secure a smart\n\
    farming platform against adversaries. Trust management is one of the mechanisms\
    \ that\ncan enhance the security and privacy of data in a smart farming platform.\
    \ It enables a\nservice provider to evaluate the trustworthiness of the actors\
    \ in the system and to set some\nrestrictions on the activities of low-trustable\
    \ parties. AgriTrust [94] is a trust management\napproach designed for smart farming\
    \ applications. This framework monitors the interac-\ntions in the system and\
    \ updates trust metrics such as credibility, robustness, and reliability\nthrough\
    \ time. Using this approach, smart farming devices broadcast their feedback on\
    \ each\ntransaction to the network, therefore, this feedback can be utilized by\
    \ the trust management\nframework for trustworthiness evaluation.\nAnother mechanism\
    \ for security enhancement in smart farming is access control\nwhich is a mechanism\
    \ to consider the policies and agreements to handle requests and\naccess permissions.\
    \ These permissions can be granted based on the roles and attributes\nor agreements.\
    \ For example, Chukkapalli et al. [95] proposed an Attribute-Based Access\nControl\
    \ (ABAC) in Smart Farming. ABAC utilizes policies that combine different attributes\n\
    from different sources, including user, data, device, and environment, and provides\
    \ ﬁne-\ngrained, ﬂexible access management. In this study, the authors modeled\
    \ a smart farming\necosystem with different agriculture sensors for temperature\
    \ and soil monitoring, tractor\nand truck movement controls, as well as labor\
    \ management, and presented a mechanism\nto handle access requests to data and\
    \ devices.\nIn smart farming scenarios, data are collected in the ﬁeld and usually\
    \ transferred to\non-premise or cloud storage servers [96]. Different technologies\
    \ are used for data transfer\nin agriculture, including Wi-Fi and cellular networks.\
    \ To protect data from adversaries\nin the transfer stage, encryption is a common\
    \ technique. For this purpose, the data are\nencrypted before transmission and\
    \ then decoded at the destination. Wen Xue et al. [97]\npresented an encryption\
    \ method for agricultural information systems. This method builds\nsecure communication\
    \ among users, farmers, and cloud servers. The statistical results in\nthe paper\
    \ showed that the presented method reduced the needed time for encryption as\n\
    compared with other available methods. Another encryption method for smart farming\n\
    applications was introduced by Ametepe et al. [98]. This study proposed a hybrid\
    \ method\ncombining two different cryptographic approaches, and then tested the\
    \ presented method\non a crop monitoring system.\nA platform for smart farming\
    \ can leverage the mentioned solutions, including trust\nmanagement, access control,\
    \ and encrypted data transmission to ensure that security and\nprivacy during\
    \ all stages of smart farming procedures, as shown in Figure 2. Another\nstate-of-the-art\
    \ technology that can be used for enhancing security and privacy in smart\nfarming\
    \ is the blockchain. This technology has been used in some agriculture applications\n\
    and could reshape smart farming ecosystems in the future. Blockchain technology\
    \ is a\ndistributed ledger that keeps the records of all previous transactions\
    \ in a system [99]. In\naddition, this technology enables automatic procedure\
    \ execution using smart contracts.\nA smart contract is a computer program that\
    \ can be deployed on a blockchain platform\nto run some procedures automatically\
    \ without human intervention [29]. In recent years,\nblockchain technology and\
    \ smart contracts have been widely used in different smart\nAgriculture 2022,\
    \ 12, 838\n13 of 18\nfarming applications, including trust management [100,101],\
    \ water management [102,103],\nfood traceability [104], and supply chain [105,106].\n\
    4.6. Regulation and Policies\nConsidering the available regulations and practices\
    \ in agriculture, a mechanism for\ncompliance with these rules is beneﬁcial in\
    \ a smart farming platform. The regulations\nrelated to smart farming cover different\
    \ aspects of agriculture, including but not limited to,\nfood security, biosecurity,\
    \ climate change, and data governance. In the following, some of\nthese regulations\
    \ in different jurisdictions are brieﬂy reviewed.\nThe European Union’s Common\
    \ Agricultural Policy (CAP) [107] is a uniﬁed policy\nacross Europe to support\
    \ farmers and to improve agricultural productivity. This policy\naims to improve\
    \ the farming economy, address concerns regarding climate changes, and\nmanage\
    \ natural resource consumption. In smart farming applications, the policy supports\n\
    technical progress to enhance agriculture productivity as well as reduce ecological\
    \ foot-\nprints. Another objective for the CAP is to control the availability\
    \ of supplies and to ensure\nthat the prices of products are reasonable for both\
    \ producers and customers. Another\nwidely used regulation under the European\
    \ Union’s jurisdiction is the European Union\n(EU) Code of Conduct on Agricultural\
    \ Data Sharing by Contractual Agreement [108]. The\nCommittee of Professional\
    \ Agricultural Organizations (COPA) and the General Confed-\neration of Agricultural\
    \ Cooperatives (COGECA) published this code of conduct in 2020.\nThis code mainly\
    \ focuses on non-personal data collected on farms and leaves the personal\ndata\
    \ to be treated under other regulations. The code indicates that due to the nature\
    \ of\ncollected data in agriculture, it is impossible to deﬁne data ownership\
    \ in the same way as\nphysical objects and it suggests using different levels\
    \ of rights. Therefore, the key step from\nthis code’s point of view is a contract\
    \ that determines the rights of all parties to protect\ntheir sensitive information,\
    \ while all permissions related to data collection, access, and\nutilization are\
    \ needed to be approved by the data originator. To evaluate the compliance\nof\
    \ a product or service with this code, a checklist consisting of ﬁfteen questions\
    \ has been\nprovided by the publishers. These questions specify the collected\
    \ data and the rights to\nshare, access, and use these data.\nIn addition, several\
    \ regulations related to smart farming are used in the U.S. juris-\ndiction. An\
    \ example is the U.S. agricultural policy [109] which covers different aspects\n\
    of agriculture such as trade, insurance, rural economic growth, bioenergy, and\
    \ organic\nfarming. This policy aims to support U.S. farmers, to enhance the productivity\
    \ of the farm-\ning process, and to reduce negative environmental impact. Generally,\
    \ in a ﬁve-year cycle,\nthe farm acts are updated to govern agriculture, food,\
    \ and rural development programs.\nIn the context of smart farming, this policy\
    \ considers different technologies such as GPS,\ncomputer mapping, guidance systems,\
    \ and variable-rate technology [110]. The Food Safety\nModernization Act (FSMA)\
    \ [111] is another law related to smart farming in the USA. This\nact aims to\
    \ enhance food safety and to prevent foodborne illness and has seven major rules\n\
    ensuring responsibility and accountability of different parties that work in the\
    \ agricultural\nsections. Different tools have been provided by the U.S. government\
    \ to facilitate product\ntracing, build food defense plans, and create food safety\
    \ plans. Another regulation related\nto smart farming in the U.S. jurisdiction\
    \ is the Privacy and Security Principles for Farm\nData (PSPFD) [112]. It was\
    \ established by the American Farm Bureau Federation (AFBF) in\n2014. The principles\
    \ under this regulation are mostly around data ownership, consent, and\ndisclosure.\
    \ To ensure compliance with PSPFD, the AFBF has developed the Ag Data Trans-\n\
    parency Evaluator. This tool assesses contracts among agriculture stakeholders\
    \ against the\nprinciples provided in the PSPFD, and if the procedure is successful,\
    \ the contract gets an\nAg Data Transparency seal that informs the parties that\
    \ it has been approved.\nDespite the efforts on regulations related to big data\
    \ in smart farming, there are\nstill some gaps in this ﬁeld. One of the issues\
    \ is the lack of comprehensive and uniﬁed\nregulations for agriculture data, while\
    \ the available practices and a code of conduct are\nnot compulsory. To make the\
    \ most use of sources in digital agriculture, a smart farming\nAgriculture 2022,\
    \ 12, 838\n14 of 18\nplatform needs to provide mechanisms ensuring compliance\
    \ with available policies in\nsmart farming. A smart farming platform should encourage\
    \ the parties to trust the services\nprovided and participate in collaborative\
    \ practices that enhance the performance of data\nprocessing systems in agriculture\
    \ applications.\n5. Conclusions\nSmart farming provides the agricultural industry\
    \ with diverse data-driven services\nwhich improve different applications from\
    \ farm to fork. These services beneﬁt from a large\namount of available data in\
    \ smart farming ecosystems. However, a major challenge in\nsmart farming information\
    \ processing is consistency and compatibility among the utilized\ntechnologies,\
    \ procedures, and protocols. To address this issue, in this paper, we suggest\
    \ the\nplatform approach which is a design thinking approach that encourages different\
    \ actors in\na smart farming ecosystem to facilitate collaboration among different\
    \ services by following\nsome requirements. Moreover, we suggest six requirements\
    \ for a smart farming platform,\nincluding interoperability, real-time data processing,\
    \ scalability, reliability, security, and\ncompliance with farming regulations.\
    \ Such a platform can enhance the available services\nin the agriculture industry\
    \ by enabling collaboration among different service providers.\nFurthermore, such\
    \ a platform facilitates data-sharing practices by reducing security and\nprivacy\
    \ concerns and providing a trustable environment for agriculture data holders.\n\
    Currently, a major limitation to developing such a framework is the lack of uniﬁed\
    \ protocols\nand standards, and more effort from technology providers and policymakers\
    \ is needed\nto address this issue. In future work, we aim to develop and implement\
    \ a sample of the\nproposed framework. To this end, we plan to utilize the available\
    \ software and hardware\nproducts that follow similar protocols, and therefore,\
    \ are compatible.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, R.D. and M.A.-Z.;\

    rights and content Highlights • Data sharing in agri-food is hindered by several
    real-world challenges. • Technology has a pivotal role to play when it comes to
    data sharing pipelines. • Data Trusts could be employed to allow data sharing
    to be adopted in agri-food. • Sharing trained machine learning models could allow
    for knowledge exchange. • This is definitely the case when sharing data is not
    possible. Abstract Data sharing is often hindered by a number of real word challenges
    caused by a mixture of technological and social factors. To date, the agri-food
    sector significantly lags behind other sectors in overcoming these challenges.
    However, the benefits of data sharing are too great to be ignored as they have
    a potential to address many historical failings such as issues related to food
    safety, traceability and transparency, and must be carefully considered as the
    sector is undergoing a widespread digitalisation. In this article, we explore
    the potential of different technologies in addressing the challenges presented
    by data sharing in the agri-food sector, and how the use of these technologies
    in the narrative of a Data Trust may address many of these obstacles. We argue
    the importance of utilising semantic web technologies, distributed ledger technologies,
    machine learning, and privacy preserving technologies to enable future transformative
    data sharing infrastructures in the agri-food sector. The utilisation of holistic
    statistical analysis of the shared data is also discussed, vital in supporting
    many of the sectors optimisation and sustainability goals. Previous article in

    supply chains 1. Introduction Data sharing poses many opportunities to address
    the historical failings impacting the agri-food supply chain, such as traceability
    and transparency in cases of food fraud (Sarpong, 2014, O’mahony, 2013). Many
    domains have seen great success from data sharing, notably genomic research, which
    for the last two decades have shared large quantities of data enabling extensive
    analysis of rare diseases, only possible through collaborative sharing (Taroni
    et al., 2019, Byrd et al., 2020). Other domains, in particular ones that have
    a more sensitive commercial component, such as drug discovery and pharmaceuticals,
    could also benefit from data sharing (e.g. in the need for rapid solutions to
    the Covid-19 pandemic); however, in such commercial settings, where intellectual
    property might be worth hundred of millions of pounds, sharing data might be seen
    as a less attractive aspect, resulting in reluctance to adopt data sharing principles.
    In addition, data sharing mechanisms are easily impeded by technical issues related
    to e.g. data quality, transparency and privacy protection concerns, and interoperability
    issues, as well as a host of social considerations including inequality and complex
    power dynamics (Stalla-Bourdillon et al., 2020, Open Data Insitute, 2019, van
    der Burg et al., 2020). Data sharing therefore presents both a challenge and an
    opportunity to the agri-food sector. Opportunities include increased transparency
    and traceability (whether to address food safety concerns or to meet consumer
    demand) (Feng et al., 2020), the potential for increased overall system efficiency
    via data science insights (Pham and Stack, 2018), and a general increase in cooperation
    and decrease in administrative friction. Beyond the technical challenges, which
    are the focus of this article, there are other major blockers in understanding
    ownership of data and correctly incentivising sharing by providing significant
    benefits. For example, reluctant partners can easily stymie data sharing, particularly
    if they are powerful actors in the food system (Open Data Insitute, 2020a). The
    primary gains possible from data sharing depend on the style and purpose of the
    sharing. One model to help support sharing is that of a Data Trust, in which independent,
    fiduciary stewardship of data is provided (Open Data Insitute, 2020b). In a regulatory
    setting where data sharing is required for compliance purposes, Data Trusts could
    remove some data maintenance and storage burden from industrial actors. However,
    perhaps more importantly Data Trusts could increase the speed of traceability
    for food safety related incidents and product recalls. In a wider setting of sharing
    production or pre-competitive data, there is significant potential for improved
    efficiency and profit, both for the sector as a whole and for individual operators.
    To focus our discussion more concretely and meet our objectives, we consider two
    particular use-cases for data sharing within agri-food, aligning with these two
    example types of gains, and outline some associated challenges and opportunities.
    Finally, the objectives of this article are (a) to explore the potential of different
    technologies – some established and others emerging – in addressing the challenges
    presented by data sharing in the agri-food sector; and (b) to discuss how these
    technologies, within the context of a Data Trust, can be used in practice to overcome
    the obstacles associated with data sharing. 1.1. Food and drink sector The UK
    Food and Drink sector is the largest manufacturing sector in the whole country,
    valued at about £100bn (Food and Drink federation and Santader Food and Industry
    Report, 2020); it is larger than automotive and aerospace combined. In 2018, total
    food and drink export figures were worth more than £23bn, with the top three export
    markets being Ireland, USA and France. The food supply chain employs about 4 million
    people and generated over £121bn of added value for the economy each year. It
    is largely a small and medium enterprises (SME) sector, as 97% of food and drink
    businesses are SMEs (Food and Drink federation and Santader Food and Industry
    Report, 2020). Although the effect of Brexit is still unclear, it is estimated
    that more than 100,000 new recruits will be needed by 2024 to feed the ever-growing
    population and meet market demand. UK Food and Drink sector includes several sub-sectors,
    e.g. animal feeds, bakery, confectionary, dairy, fish, fruit and vegetables, meat,
    etc., with the top 10 export products being whisky, salmon, chocolate, wine, cheese,
    gin, beef, pork, breakfast cereals and beer. Such is the growth of the sector
    that several of these products have seen more than a 10% increase on export demand
    in the last couple of years (Food and Drink federation and Santader Food and Industry
    Report, 2020). 1.2. Use Case 1: Traceability beyond one-up and one-down Traceability
    of goods within the food system is desireable from a number of perspectives, including
    regulatory requirements (e.g. in the case of bovine livestock in Europe (Council
    of European Union, 1992)), for food safety monitoring, and to satisfy consumer
    demand. Currently, apart from systems where central government reporting is required,
    a system of ‘one-up-one-down’ traceability is the norm (Wallace and Manning, 2020):
    here each actor in a supply chain will know the source and the destination of
    their products or goods, but will not know the next eventual destination or the
    original source. While this system does preserve the necessary information to
    reconstruct a product history through contacting all actors in the chain, it is
    cumbersome and may be too slow in a food safety emergency. 1.3. Use Case 2: Sharing
    data for production optimisation Insights leading to improved production efficiency
    may be possible from data analytic approaches on production data either from learned
    insights from the overall data or by an actor comparing their efficiency directly
    to their peers in an effort to identify areas of possible improvement (Wolfert
    et al., 2017). Both of these would naively seem to require direct pooling of data
    between competitors, which data holders may be uncomfortable with. However, as
    we expand on below, there are a number of technological approaches that may allow
    some of this advantage to be gained while protecting individual commercial sensitivities.
    1.4. Challenges to data sharing Several social challenges to data sharing are
    reported in an Open Data Institute report describing a pilot study of a Data Trust
    for reducing food waste (Open Data Insitute, 2019). In particular, they report
    that businesses feared that sharing data might reveal commercially sensitive information
    to competitors, or that it might result in bad publicity for the sharer, and hence
    pose a reputational risk. Overall, they noted that manufacturers and retailers
    saw little value in sharing data about food waste, feeling that the benefits were
    insufficient to justify the competitive and reputational risks and the effort
    required to prepare the data. Trust and power between actors play a significant
    role in the uptake and ethical value of data sharing, even where legislation designed
    to support equitable sharing is in place (van der Burg et al., 2020). Where legislation
    is limited or absent, the situation may be even more untenable — agricultural
    actors have sometimes been reluctant to share data over a lack of trust with those
    who are gathering, collating, and sharing the data, and uncertainty about how
    data will be used and shared eventually (Wiseman et al., 2019, Jakku et al., 2019).
    It is clear that if actors in agri-food systems are to willingly participate in
    data sharing (via Data Trusts or otherwise) we must mitigate these concern, and
    the benefits of the sharing must be sufficient to overcome these social challenges.
    In addition to critical social challenges, there are a variety of technological
    challenges to effective data sharing (Feng et al., 2020, Chawinga and Zinn, 2019,
    Grabus and Greenberg, 2019). These span the entire data lifecycle and relate to
    the data format and encryption levels used by Data Trusts, security and transparency
    of data access, and ultimately the utilisation of data assets through analysis
    and as evidence. A pre-agreed data sharing system for traceability could significantly
    improve the efficiency and reliability of product tracing, regardless of whether
    the data required resided in a central location or locally with actors under careful
    federated agreements. However, widespread adoption of digital technologies including
    data sharing in sectors such as Agri-Food have yet to materialise; indeed almost
    60% of UK farm data are paper-based (Agrimetrics, 2020). In this paper, we expand
    on opportunities and challenges of Data Trusts, in particular discussing how Data
    Trusts and various technological approaches to data integration might address
    them. 2. Related work on data trusts and data sharing Data sharing has been largely
    enabled through the advent of cloud-based technologies, with the competition between
    large players pushing the limits in infrastructural capabilities and costs. Across
    Microsoft Azure,2 Amazon Web Services,3 and Google Cloud Computing4 one can find
    a plethora of cloud-based solutions spanning end-to-end pipelines, i.e. from data
    input and aggregation to model development and business intelligence. Such pipelines
    allow for a streamlined process of keeping data in remote locations – in a fault
    tolerant manner – enabling companies to rely less on local infrastructure. Along
    the lines of automation and cloud computing, cloud manufacturing has become popular
    over the past few years, as a resource sharing paradigm (Mourad and Nassehi, 2020).
    Through cloud manufacturing, businesses can have remote access to a pool of manufacturing
    resources and capabilities, akin to other cloud-based resources. This new paradigm
    enables businesses to leverage the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and its
    underlying infrastructure as a service including architecture models, and data
    and information exchange protocols. In this process, interoperability is a key
    component as it allows the implementation of vertically or horizontally integrated
    cyber–physical systems for production engineering (Mourad and Nassehi, 2020).
    In 2018, the EU launched the EU code of conduct for agricultural data sharing
    by contractual agreement, which encourages transparency about data use (van der
    Burg et al., 2020). The scope of this EU code has been to enable trust through
    the establishment of contractual agreements between the parties concerned with
    the data exchange process. In such cases, fostering trust goes beyond contractual
    agreements, whereby power relationships might be influencing the direction these
    agreements might take, as argued in van der Burg et al. (2020). Therefore contractual
    agreements are only one small component of the processes needed to accommodate
    data sharing. ODI (Open Data Insitute, 2020b) have made significant progress in
    standardising concepts and processes around Data Trusts through their engagement
    with various stakeholders and UK universities. For example, the UK Biobank (UK
    Biobank, 2014) has collected and maintained data since 2006; stewardship is achieved
    via its status as a charitable company with a board of directors that “act as
    charity trustees under UK charity law and company directors under UK company law”
    (Open Data Insitute, 2020b). Other similar examples provided by ODI revolve around
    data stewardship within the context of a Trust: an independent legal entity requiring
    a careful framework of agreements. For small enterprises in particular the complexity
    of the legal framework required can be daunting, and discourage involvement. Within
    agri-food, many of the efforts in organised data sharing have included only an
    informal Data Trust, often within one organisation or company and focusing around
    one product or chain e.g. multi-IoT based sensor data aggregation as a systems
    approach (Chen et al., 2017, Gunasekaran et al., 2016), with (Elijah et al., 2018)
    providing a comprehensive overview of how modern IoT and data analytics approaches
    can enable smart agriculture towards boosting productivity and sustainability.
    Blockchain technologies have contributed to a number of agri-food data sharing
    systems (Pearson et al., 2019), and have shown potential value when coupled with
    other technologies such as IoTs (Torky and Hassanein, 2020) and machine learning
    (Khan et al., 2020). Machine learning approaches and ontologies have been primarily
    used in the context of agri-food data analytics for precision agriculture (Morota
    et al., 2018, Alhnaity et al., 2019, Chukkapalli et al., 2020, Aydin and Aydin,
    2020). In this diverse technological landscape, privacy preserving approaches
    have started gaining momentum as components of larger pipelines that might also
    include blockchain (Makhdoom et al., 2020) or machine learning (Arachchige et
    al., 2020). The appeal of privacy preserving technologies is clear: they enable
    computation despite the fact that raw data are obscured, hence any data exchange
    occurs with encrypted data. This could be invaluable in overcoming concerns about
    data privacy, competitiveness, and reputational risk. Despite existing and emerging
    technologies, we are still far from converging on an established model of a Data
    Trust — either legally or technologically. Some reasons that might have led to
    this are touched upon in Delacroix and Lawrence (2019), where among others, the
    concept about “one size fits all” in data governance is considered as a hindering
    factor, going on to suggest that a “plurarity of Trusts” could be a way forward.
    Regulatory concerns and how personal data can be protected within a Data Trust
    are essential to their adoption, where Stalla-Bourdillon et al. (2020) identifies
    the necessity of legal and social foundations implementing a ’data protection
    by design’ philosophy into Data Trusts. This is also considered in Delacroix and
    Lawrence (2019), which builds upon the “Growing the Artificial Intelligence Industry
    in the UK” report published by the UK Government in 2017 (UK Gov, 2017). Another
    direction to Data Trust in agri-food revolves around approaches that increase
    transparency and availability of information as a means to increase trust (Probst,
    2020, Jakku et al., 2019). In particular, the concept around transparency is considered
    in the context of sociotechnical factors and conditions that influence the development
    of smart farming (Jakku et al., 2019), touching upon issues around use of data,
    scepticism about the value of smart technologies and balancing expectations within
    the farming industry. It becomes evident that data sharing quickly becomes a very
    complex problem when considering all factors involved, let alone in the context
    of Data Trusts. Regarding adoption issues and lack of a universally accepted Data
    Trust system, we speculate that the complexity of data collected across sectors,
    interoperability issues, analytics as a knowledge extraction process, and business
    intelligence as a decision making mechanism for improving performance, could mean
    that multiple Data Trusts might need to be proposed to accommodate the specific
    needs found within individual sectors, along the lines discussed in Delacroix
    and Lawrence (2019). As data control processes become more and more complex, Data
    Trust systems could be developed and tailored to a sub-sector level, adopting
    some components and/or implementing new ones. 3. Role of technology A wide variety
    of technological approaches may be useful in overcoming the aforementioned challenges
    to data sharing previously outlined, thus allowing the agri-food sector to best
    take advantage of the opportunities available. Below we mention a number of technologies
    that we believe have potential to address a spectrum of technological and social
    complexities at various stages of the data lifecycle. At the most basic level,
    data interoperability and reuse will require agreement on data formats and reproducible
    data pipelines. A suitable format for incoming data is crucial; while this point
    may seem very straightforward, it really is critical to enable value-adding data
    processing or inference to occur. Machine-readable data that can be accessed by
    a programmatic interface will allow best value: that is, a structured filetype
    (e.g. YAML, JSON, HDF5) with an agreed format will allow smoother updates and
    quicker use of new data than a non-readable or changing format (e.g. a scanned
    pdf or a spreadsheet with a non-agreed format). Semantic web technologies can
    take the description of machine-readable data even further. Data is represented
    in a form of a graph described using the Resource Description Framework (RDF)
    (Patel-Schneider and Hayes, 2014) and ontology languages such as OWL (W3C OWL
    Working Group, 2012) are used to produce formal models of semantic annotations
    for a specific domain. Applying such annotations to raw data will produce semantic
    metadata that can formally describe the types of individual data elements and
    their relationships to other data represented within the same or any other dataset,
    thus forming a knowledge graph. Data described using standard semantic frameworks
    may be further processed using automated pipelines to infer new knowledge, to
    integrate with other datasets, or to validate for missing information. For example,
    SPARQL query language (Harris and Seaborne, 2013) can be used to query and transform
    data stored in multiple distributed repositories and recently developed standards
    such as SHACL (Kontokostas and Knublauch, 2017) can be used to define data quality
    rules to support management of knowledge graphs. Recently, distributed ledger
    technologies (DLTs) have been gaining traction in agrifood through both commercial
    platforms (e.g. Food Trust from IBM5 ) and proposed research prototypes and pilot
    systems (Caro et al., 2018, Sylvester, 2019, Kamilaris et al., 2019). Key characteristics
    of DLT solutions include the immutability of stored records (i.e., records cannot
    in retrospect be falsified), transparency of data operations, and decentralised
    data access and storage. These characteristics make DLTs a strong candidate for
    applications where data availability is crucial and data is contributed by a range
    of third parties with varying levels of trust (e.g. within a traceability scenario
    where there is risk of retrospective record fraud). However, it is important to
    note that DLTs on their own are not a complete solution to data sharing challenges,
    which is further discussed in Section 4.4. In the presence of ingested and structured
    data, machine learning approaches can be very good candidates to perform analyses
    and extract knowledge. Such analyses have shown much success in agri-food, ranging
    from yield prediction (Alhnaity et al., 2019) to disease detection (Shruthi et
    al., 2019). Federated computing and federated machine learning address one of
    the resulting challenges from the holistic view of data analysis, seeing vast
    adoption in big data to maintain local ownership (Bonawitz et al., 2019). Under
    such federated computing models, standard data analysis methodologies can be undertaken,
    sharing only model updates of the training procedure rather than the raw data
    itself. Additionally, machine learning can assist in the earlier and fundamental
    stage of interoperability. Outlier detection (Domingues et al., 2018) and imputation
    (Liu and Gopalakrishnan, 2017) are a few proven machine learning methodologies
    modelling high-dimensional data input to provide high quality and error free data
    for further analysis. Privacy preserving technologies (PPT) are emerging technologies
    that have gained momentum recently and which have the ability to allow knowledge
    extraction and machine learning without compromising privacy. Various cryptographic
    schemes have been developed that can accommodate the analysis of data even without
    revealing information about the raw data at the individual level. Techniques such
    as fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) (Gentry and Halevi, 2011), secure multiparty
    computation (SMPC) (Wang et al., 2017), order preserving encryption (OPE) (Agrawal
    et al., 2004) and differential privacy (Abadi et al., 2016) can be used as part
    of machine learning end-to-end pipelines, albeit carrying a large overhead. While
    many of these techniques are still in their early days of application and so the
    technological barriers could be significant, their potential to contribute to
    data sharing is very high: they provide a way in which any party in the trust
    or federation could share encrypted data and compute functions on aggregated data
    without anyone ever holding enough information to infer any other party’s individual
    data. 4. A call for technologically-mediated data sharing in agri-food We believe
    that the advantages of data sharing across a variety of use cases within agri-food
    justify pursuing Data Trusts for data sharing within the sector, and that technologies
    can help overcome the challenges associated with trust, data formatting and understanding,
    and data privacy. As examples of possible systems, we refer back to our two use-cases.
    Within our traceability use case, we can imagine the use of a number of different
    technologies depending on the regulatory framework and the motivation for tracing.
    Our production optimisation would benefit from a variety of technologies, with
    the focus depending on the preferences of data sharers and the sensitivity of
    the data. In the following sections we expand on the potential of several different
    approaches and technologies, making reference to our use cases throughout. 4.1.
    From data sharing to model sharing? In the context of Data Trusts, the data shared
    typically takes the form of raw or pre-processed data (transformed, aggregated,
    cleansed, etc.), but not models derived from those data. If our goal is not the
    data sharing in itself but instead the use case of production optimisation (Section
    1.3) via collective intelligence to improve productivity, performance, sustainability,
    etc., one wonders whether this can be achieved via means other than data sharing,
    e.g. sharing trained models instead. This process is akin to sharing physical
    models of a system that describes its behaviour and can be used as a data generation
    mechanism (simulation systems, see (APSIM, 2020)). Along these lines machine learning
    approaches and particularly a sub-domain called Deep Learning, have enabled the
    transfer of knowledge between and within domains through the exchange of trained
    models. As Deep Learning approaches are based on Artificial Neural Networks, which
    are high dimensional non-linear models, there has been an abundance of approaches
    concerning transfer learning and domain adaptation that allow the transfer of
    knowledge through sharing learned parameters (Thota et al., 2020, Wilson and Cook,
    2020). In various real-life problems, there exist many high level concepts that
    are consistent across various domains, e.g. shapes, texture, spatial distribution,
    etc. Therefore, extracting representations for such concepts from domain X can
    be very relevant to a cognate domain Y. This line of thinking can be extrapolated
    to our specific use cases, investigating production optimisation via crop yield
    data. In this case, data from Farm X can be used to develop a machine learning-based
    yield forecasting model for Farm X. This high dimensional complex system can be
    used as a surrogate model, which upon fine-tuning it with data from Farm Y (hence
    incorporating knowledge from Farm X as well), Farm Y can gain an advantage over
    Farm X, which has only used its own data (Farm X’s data). At no point in this
    process has Farm Y seen any of the raw data used by Farm X to develop the initial
    model, which was shared with Farm Y. This process is visually depicted in Fig.
    1. In addition, given the non-linearities involved along with extensive hyperparametrisation,
    it becomes a non-trivial problem to reconstruct the exact raw data given that
    the parameters one is sharing (model sharing) are highly sensitive to hyperparametrisation.

    Fig. 1. Visual depiction of the model sharing methodology. Model Y is trained
    with data Y, but its parameters are initialised with those of model X. Black lines
    represent the statistical model, black crosses represent local data. We believe
    model sharing to be another exciting possibility, that when thinking of Data Trusts
    as a more holistic approach, could actually be one direction that organisations
    can take to accommodate knowledge exchange rather than solely focusing on data
    sharing. That aligns with our earlier statement that “one size fits all” approach
    might not be the way forward and that agri-food organisations should be aware
    of the various ways available that can allow for a step-change to occur within
    this industry. Besides going from 0% to 100% (with 0% being no data/Knowledge
    sharing/exchange at all, and 100% being fully open data) is a continuum, in that
    step-wise improvement can take various shapes and make use of the whole spectrum
    of possible adoption levels that can suit the organisational needs. 4.2. Federated
    learning for decentralised analysis Following from model sharing, yet maintaining
    the concept of our production optimisation for actors across the supply chain
    via a holistic view of data, we return to the notion of more traditional and alternative
    view of data analytics from a collection of data. We therefore ponder the idea
    of performing machine learning training to produce one model on a number of independent
    and decentralised datasets simultaneously, without the exchange of raw data. On
    the contrary to model sharing, it is simpler to gain a holistic analysis of data
    when presented with all available data during training, so we ask, can we leverage
    multiple independent, distributed datasets in the training procedure to produce
    one model encapsulating data from multiple sources at scale? This approach, commonly
    known as federated learning, have shown vast success in large scale industry applications,
    trained with highly sensitive data, most notably powering predictive texting in
    our phones (Bonawitz et al., 2019). Conceptually, rather than data being centralised,
    data analysis is performed across all decentralised data stores/ nodes simultaneously
    via aggregation and dissemination of model updates. Such a technological implementation
    fits hand-in-hand with the proposition of decentralised models of Data Trusts,
    providing holistic analysis that leverages data across sources whilst maintaining
    privacy and eliminating raw data sharing. The previous example of production optimisation
    via crop yield forecast (Fig. 1) can be also be applied to here, where Farm X
    and Farm Y each have their own data, we follow the regime presented in Yang et
    al. (2019) and represented in Fig. 2. To train the model, a central node which
    we will call C, controls the communication and computes the model updates. For
    each step in the training procedure, C will send a copy of the model parameters
    to each of the Farm nodes X and Y, each farm node will then perform a forward
    step on the model (each node has identical models) and the resulting variables
    are sent to back to C. The C node will aggregate these variables and compute a
    set of updates based on the data from X and Y, the updates are sent back to each
    node X and Y to update each model. This entire procedure eliminates raw data sharing,
    and allows a single model to be developed leveraging data from all participating
    datastores. Privacy has been at the forefront of the design and implementation
    of federated learning, differential privacy and encryption has played a key role
    in securing individual’s data (Lim et al., 2020), the former of which is elaborated
    on in Section 4.3. Additionally, the introduction of blockchain technologies have
    allowed for improved accountability reducing the effectiveness of malicious attacks
    (Desai et al., 2020). Furthermore, scalability is a driving factor, where continuous
    and low compute updates to the model are trivial, essential in sectors that record
    frequently. Consequently, this opens the possibility of Internet of Things (IoT)
    devices (the collection, processing and analysis of data from interconnected devices
    within a system, for the provision of smart solutions in the argi-food supply
    chain (Kamilaris et al., 2016)) being integrated into the federated network seamlessly.

    Fig. 2. Depiction of centralised federated learning in which no access or sharing
    of data between nodes is undertaken. The temporal process moves left to right
    (a–d). Black lines represent the statistical model, and black crosses the local
    data on each node (Wikimedia Commons and Jeromemetronome, 2019). Federated learning
    and federated computing in general could power the data analytics behind decentralised
    Data Trusts, operating across all participating organisations and even on IoT
    devices directly, potentially reducing management impacts on actors (Brewster
    et al., 2017). The scalability and adaptability of federated models lends itself
    to the advancements in technology, not only providing solutions to data sharing
    issues that have arisen now, but providing a proven platform for expansion as
    the adoption of data acquisition increases and subsequent technological challenges
    arise. Additionally, leading from the belief that the “one size fits all” approach
    may not be the ideal solution, federated learning can be implemented into the
    argi-food supply chain one step and one model at a time, expanding to new organisational
    challenges as trust in the Data Trust develops. 4.3. Privacy preserving technologies
    Regardless of which technologies help achieve traceability and transparency, or
    improve product optimisation, all beneficiaries gain from increased privacy to
    help develop trust within data sharing. Simply ensuring that data privacy is maintained
    addresses the most apparent social implication of commercial sensitivity (Open
    Data Insitute, 2019), both between actors within a data sharing environment, but
    also from malicious actors outside. Previous technologies in Sections 4.1 From
    data sharing to model sharing?, 4.2 Federated learning for decentralised analysis
    can be seen as privacy preserving technologies (PPT), following a more implicit
    approach decoupling data analysis from traditional data centralisation. Yet it
    is common for more explicit methodologies to preserve privacy to be blended alongside.
    Differential privacy operates under the notion that the addition of noise to a
    statistical model of data inhibits an adversary to exactly reverse-engineer sensitive
    data of an individual (Dwork et al., 2014, Abadi et al., 2016). This concept has
    seen a recent re-emergence in deep learning (Arachchige et al., 2019), while it
    has been commonplace and the forefront of development of federated learning algorithms
    (Choudhury et al., 2019, Wei et al., 2020), where the process defining federated
    learning lends itself to the implementation of differential privacy (Geyer et
    al., 2017). As such, the implementation of differential privacy is not only achievable
    but practical in terms of computational overhead, yet the benefits to ensuring
    trust in knowledge sharing can be significant. Extending the concept of privacy
    preserving statistical data analysis to the most complete case, Fully Homomorphic
    Encryption (FHE) aims to extract knowledge through statistical models like the
    former, yet doing so on fully encrypted data without decryption the data first.
    This maintains privacy throughout the entire process of knowledge extraction,
    data to result. Successful implementations have shown the potential applicability
    of FHE in industrial settings (Masters et al., 2019), with a recent toolkit by
    IBM providing a platform for development.6 However, FHE for complex tasks comes
    with large computational overhead, and subsequent loss of performance due to the
    necessity of approximation (Domingo-Ferrer et al., 2019), reducing the attractiveness
    of an approach in its current state. Although the applicability of FHE is non-trivial
    and still a major research topic, the fundamental principle is very attractive
    for our propositions, all whilst being easily explainable, assisting in knowledge
    dissemination and understanding, therefore eliciting trust between actors within
    a data sharing model. PPT are not only essential in building trust for data sharing,
    but also a necessary precaution in a modern world of data sensitivity and regulatory
    obligations. As such, we believe that PPT lies at the heart of all data sharing,
    where privacy can be maintained between individuals data whilst holistic and novel
    knowledge extraction can be achieved assisting in our ongoing challenges related
    to traceability and product optimisation. 4.4. Leveraging semantic technologies
    and blockchain to facilitate centralised and federated data sharing Whether it
    is raw data or data models that are to be shared, a suitable underlining data
    sharing infrastructure must exist. Following from our earlier discussions such
    infrastructure should support automation based on machine-readable data formats,
    and secure and trusted data assessment mechanisms. Blockchain networks (a type
    of DLT) can be formed to hold data about arbitrary domains (Zheng et al., 2018).
    For example, a single transaction recorded on a blockchain can describe an exchange
    of money between two parties trading an item, but it can also record results of
    sensor readings such as location of an animal. Blockchain networks have gained
    popularity for their ability to deliver immutability of shared data, transparency
    of data transactions, and high data availability due to data duplication across
    multiple nodes. Certain blockchains such as Ethereum7 and Hyperledger8 also allow
    for deployment of decentralised applications (DApps) where data input and retrieval
    is managed via so called smart contracts (Nærland et al., 2017), which is an implementation
    of an idea originally proposed by Nick Szabo in 1997.9 Smart contracts are programs
    that can execute on the blockchain network and define, for example, the structure
    of transactions that participating entities can complete on the network (e.g.
    to record purchase and sale of assets as they are moving through a supply chain).
    Business blockchain networks also provide functionalities for permissioned data
    access where actors can be restricted from accessing different parts of the blockchain
    functionalities and the data it stores. Given our traceability use case scenario,
    blockchain technologies possess an obvious advantage over the existing systems.
    For example, in case of an outbreak of a food borne disease such as that caused
    by E. coli, the real-time availability of data across the whole supply chain is
    important in order to identify potentially contaminated products and issue recalls.
    Transparent records of transactions between different food supply actors and the
    immutability of records may be also useful for regulators in aiding discovery
    of potential cases of food fraud. However, several challenges relating to the
    use of blockchain have been highlighted to date, including scalability and negative
    environmental impact due to high carbon footprint (Pearson et al., 2019, Zheng
    et al., 2018, Karame, 2016, Stoll et al., 2019). In addition, the blockchains
    technologies typically operate with only simple data types such as string, integer,
    date, etc. As such, it may be difficult to integrate data represented by different
    blockchain data models without further knowledge that is not captured in a machine-understandable
    form, hence hindering an effective automation of such processes. Given such limitations,
    it is therefore unfeasible to expect that, for example, a very complex description
    of a product and the full context in which such product was produced, transported,
    or stored would be stored on a blockchain. This may prevent traceability systems
    from realising their full potential by aiding investigations, for example, through
    discovery of common factors (e.g. use of river water) in processing workflows
    of the entities affected by an outbreak. Similar challenges will apply in case
    of model sharing and federated learning discussed in previous sections. The shared
    models and data may be too large to be shared via blockchain networks as well
    as additional metadata descriptions (e.g., model limitations, biases, algorithms
    used, etc.) which are required for effective reuse. However, such information
    may still exist within company records, possibly in a proprietary format and requiring
    a human expert to be retrieved. On the other hand, semantic web technologies that
    exist today stemmed from the idea of the Semantic Web which envisioned a globally
    interconnected web of data where much of the meaning is machine-readable (Berners-Lee
    and Fischetti, 2001). This resulted in creation of data sharing protocols for
    RDF graphs, distributed graph repositories, and standards for federated data querying
    (Pan et al., 2017), paving a way towards generic data sharing infrastructures
    based on web technologies. Such technology could then support the traceability
    scenario in both directions: as a centralised repository where all data is stored
    within a single knowledge graph; and also as a collection of distributed repositories,
    each under the control of individual data owners and publishing only a portion
    of a knowledge graph. Many semantic resources such as vocabularies, ontologies,
    and taxonomies already exist for different parts of the agri-food sector (Drury
    et al., 2019, Dooley et al., 2018, Markovic et al., 2020, Markovic et al., 2016).
    However, these are currently mostly used by the research community while the industry
    actors are influenced by, for example, GS1 family of standards.10 While data sharing
    systems based on distributed semantic repositories and federated queries for traceability
    in food supply chains have been proposed in the past (Solanki and Brewster, 2013),
    such approaches, on their own, do not address challenges related to trust, transparent
    data access, and performance including data availability from remote repositories.
    We believe that Data Trust solutions for agri-food sector may benefit from both
    blockchain and semantic technologies. In fact, as we outlined in this sub-section,
    a certain level of symbiosis between these technologies will be required to deliver
    effective data sharing mechanisms in the agri-food domain. Immutability of blockchain
    records may support trust in data sharing mechanisms while semantic web technologies
    are used to describe the data in machine-understandable form. In order to reduce
    the amount of data stored on blockchain networks to address scaleability challenges,
    semantically annotated raw data may be automatically abstracted to form more concise
    reports (Markovic et al., 2020, Markovic and Edwards, 2016), or the data may include
    only digital signatures required to validate less critical data stored as external
    resources (e.g., large RDF datasets accessed from distributed repositories) (Dai
    et al., 2018). For example, a traceability system may store the most critical
    information regarding the product on a blockchain to enable basic traceability
    functionality and also provide information to discover and validate more elaborate
    description of a production context stored in a third party semantic repository.
    Blockchains could also store information relating to data access for external
    semantic repositories and thus increasing transparency of data sharing in agri-food
    domain. 5. Conclusion Given the central importance of food systems to global heath,
    economy, and culture, it is no surprise that vast quantities of data are meticulously
    collected and collated by a wide variety of actors within these systems. While
    the volume of data collection within food systems is extensive, data sharing and
    integration has lagged behind, limiting the added-value that could be made available.
    Both social and technological challenges have contributed to this lag, and we
    have discussed the potential for technological approaches to overcome these obstacles.
    In addition, given the inherent structure of food supply chains with multiple
    actors present, then the various challenges mean that it is unlikely that physical
    data will ever be conveniently co-located and that whatever the overarching legal
    structure, one would still need technologies to address sharing and interoperability
    considerations. While the potential is clear, much work remains to be done to
    allow the agri-food sector to unlock the value of its collective data. This work
    will include further investigations into the drivers of data sharing and the key
    benefits within particular systems, as well as engineering work in building systems
    that trial data sharing via appropriate technologies. The most exciting future
    work may combine these two strands of research and involve both study of the actors
    in these systems and the regulatory frameworks in which they operate, alongside
    implemented prototypes of systems allowing these actors to understand the benefits
    of data sharing and contribute to design that fits their needs and priorities.
    As argued in this article, data sharing is a complex technical and social challenge
    and each of the technologies discussed in this article has a potential to contribute
    towards solving only part of this challenge. Therefore, it is very likely that
    any future data sharing solutions will utilise a combination of multiple technologies
    resulting in complex socio-technical systems requiring interdisciplinary expertise
    from various disciplines including computer science, social sciences, and business.

  explanation: "Edge Intelligence (EI) is the integration of AI algorithms with edge\
    \ computing, which refers to storing and processing data near the edge of the\
    \ network rather than relying on a centralized server or cloud. EI offers the\
    \ benefits of reduced latency, increased bandwidth, and improved privacy and security.\
    \ \n\nEI can be used for a variety of applications, including:\n\n* **Real-time\
    \ video analytics:** EI can be used to analyze video footage in real time, which\
    \ can be used for applications such as security and surveillance, traffic monitoring,\
    \ and manufacturing quality control.\n* **Predictive maintenance:** EI can be\
    \ used to predict when equipment is likely to fail, which can help businesses\
    \ avoid costly downtime and improve efficiency.\n* **Fraud detection:** EI can\
    \ be used to detect fraudulent transactions in real time, which can help businesses\
    \ protect their customers and their revenue.\n* **Healthcare diagnostics:** EI\
    \ can be used to diagnose diseases and other health conditions, which can help\
    \ doctors provide better care for their patients.\n* **Precision agriculture:**\
    \ EI can be used to optimize crop yields and reduce the use of pesticides and\
    \ fertilizers, which can help farmers improve their profitability and reduce their\
    \ environmental impact.\n\nEI is a rapidly growing field, and there is a great\

    years have witnessed a booming of artificial intelligence (AI) applications and
    services, spanning from personal assistant to recommendation systems to video/audio
    surveillance. More recently, with the proliferation of mobile computing and Internet
    of Things (IoT), billions of mobile and IoT devices are connected to the Internet,
    generating zillions bytes of data at the network edge. Driving by this trend,
    there is an urgent need to push the AI frontiers to the network edge so as to
    fully unleash the potential of the edge big data. To meet this demand, edge computing,
    an emerging paradigm that pushes computing tasks and services from the network
    core to the network edge, has been widely recognized as a promising solution.
    The resulted new interdiscipline, edge AI or edge intelligence (EI), is beginning
    to receive a tremendous amount of interest. However, research on EI is still in
    its infancy stage, and a dedicated venue for exchanging the recent advances of
    EI is highly desired by both the computer system and AI communities. To this end,
    we conduct a comprehensive survey of the recent research efforts on EI. Specifically,
    we first review the background and motivation for AI running at the network edge.
    We then provide an overview of the overarching architectures, frameworks, and
    emerging key technologies for deep learning model toward training/inference at
    the network edge. Finally, we discuss future research opportunities on EI. We
    believe that this survey will elicit escalating attentions, stimulate fruitful
    discussions, and inspire further research ideas on EI. Published in: Proceedings

    IEEE Funding Agency: SECTION I. Introduction We are living in an unprecedented
    booming era of artificial intelligence (AI). Driving by the recent advancements
    of algorithm, computing power, and big data, deep learning [1]—the most dazzling
    sector of AI—has made substantial breakthroughs in a wide spectrum of fields,
    ranging from computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing
    to chess playing (e.g., AlphaGo) and robotics [2]. Benefiting from these breakthroughs,
    a set of intelligent applications, as exemplified by intelligent personal assistants,
    personalized shopping recommendation, video surveillance, and smart home appliances
    have quickly ascended to the spotlight and gained enormous popularity. It is widely
    recognized that these intelligent applications are significantly enriching people’s
    lifestyle, improving human productivity, and enhancing social efficiency. As a
    key driver that boosts AI development, big data have recently gone through a radical
    shift of data source from the megascale cloud datacenters to the increasingly
    widespread end devices, e.g., mobile devices and Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices.
    Traditionally, big data, such as online shopping records, social media contents,
    and business informatics, were mainly born and stored at megascale datacenters.
    However, with the proliferation of mobile computing and IoT, the trend is reversing
    now. Specifically, Cisco estimates that nearly 850 ZB will be generated by all
    people, machines, and things at the network edge by 2021 [3]. In sharp contrast,
    the global datacenter traffic will only reach 20.6 ZB by 2021. Clearly, via bringing
    the huge volumes of data to AI, the edge ecosystem will present many novel application
    scenarios for AI and fuel the continuous booming of AI. Pushing the AI frontier
    to the edge ecosystem that resides at the last mile of the Internet, however,
    is highly nontrivial, due to the concerns on performance, cost, and privacy. Toward
    this goal, the conventional wisdom is to transport the data bulks from the IoT
    devices to the cloud datacenters for analytics [4]. However, when moving a tremendous
    amount of data across the wide area network (WAN), both monetary cost and transmission
    delay can be prohibitively high, and the privacy leakage can also be a major concern
    [5]. An alternative is on-device analytics that run AI applications on the device
    to process the IoT data locally, which, however, may suffer from poor performance
    and energy efficiency. This is because many AI applications require high computational
    power that greatly outweighs the capacity of resource- and energy-constrained
    IoT devices. To address the above-mentioned challenges, edge computing [6] has
    recently been proposed, which pushes cloud services from the network core to the
    network edges that are in closer proximity to IoT devices and data sources. As
    shown in Fig. 1, here an edge node can be nearby end-device connectable by device-to-device
    (D2D) communications [7], a server attached to an access point (e.g., WiFi, router,
    and base station), a network gateway, or even a microdatacenter available for
    use by nearby devices. While edge nodes can be varied in size: ranging from a
    credit-card-sized computer to a microdatacenter with several server racks, physical
    proximity to the information-generation sources is the most crucial characteristic
    emphasized by edge computing. Essentially, the physical proximity between the
    computing and information-generation sources promises several benefits compared
    to the traditional cloud-based computing paradigm, including low latency, energy
    efficiency, privacy protection, reduced bandwidth consumption, on-premises, and
    context awareness [6], [8]. Fig. 1. Illustration of edge computing. Show All Indeed,
    the marriage of edge computing and AI has given rise to a new research area, namely,
    “edge intelligence (EI)” or “edge AI” [9], [10]. Instead of entirely relying on
    the cloud, EI makes the most of the widespread edge resources to gain AI insight.
    Notably, EI has garnered much attention from both the industry and academia. For
    example, the celebrated Gartner hype cycle has incorporated EI as an emerging
    technology that will reach a plateau of productivity in the following five to
    ten years [11]. Major enterprises, including Google, Microsoft, Intel, and IBM,
    have put forth pilot projects to demonstrate the advantages of edge computing
    in paving the last mile of AI. These efforts have boosted a wide spectrum of AI
    applications, spanning from live video analytics [12], cognitive assistance [13]
    to precision agriculture, smart home [14], and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)
    [15]. Notably, research and practice on this emerging interdiscipline—EI—are still
    in a very early stage. There is, in general, a lack of venue dedicated for summarizing,
    discussing, and disseminating the recent advances of EI, in both industrial and
    academia. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we conduct a comprehensive and concrete
    survey of the recent research efforts on EI. Specifically, we will first review
    the background of AI. We will then discuss the motivation, definition, and rating
    of EI. Next, we will further review and taxonomically summarize the emerging computing
    architectures and enabling technologies for EI model training and inference. Finally,
    we will discuss some open research challenges and opportunities for EI. This paper
    is organized as follows. Section II gives an overview of the basic concepts of
    AI, with a focus on deep learning—the most popular sector of AI. Section III discusses
    the motivation, definition, and rating of EI. Section IV reviews the architectures,
    enabling techniques, systems, and frameworks for training EI models. Section V
    reviews the architectures, enabling techniques, systems, and frameworks for EI
    model inference. Section VI discusses future directions and challenges of EI.
    For this survey, we hope it can elicit escalating attentions, stimulate fruitful
    discussions, and inspire further research ideas on EI. SECTION II. Primer on Artificial
    Intelligence In this section, we review the concepts, models, and methods for
    AI, with a particular focus on deep learning—the most popular sector of AI. A.
    Artificial Intelligence While AI has recently ascended to the spotlight and gained
    tremendous attention, it is not a new term and it was first coined in 1956. Simply
    put, AI is an approach to build intelligent machines capable of carrying out tasks
    as humans do. This is obviously a very broad definition, and it can refer from
    Apple Siri to Google AlphaGo and too powerful technologies yet to be invented.
    In simulating human intelligence, AI systems typically demonstrate at least some
    of the following behaviors associated with human intelligence: planning, learning,
    reasoning, problem-solving, knowledge representation, perception, motion, and
    manipulation and, to a lesser extent, social intelligence, and creativity. During
    the past 60 year’s development, AI has experienced rise, fall, and again rise
    and fall. The latest rise of AI after 2010s was partially due to the breakthroughs
    made by deep learning, a method that has achieved human-level accuracy in some
    interesting areas. B. Deep Learning and Deep Neural Networks Machine learning
    (ML) is an effective method to achieve the goal of AI. Many ML methodologies as
    exemplified by decision tree, K -means clustering, and Bayesian network have been
    developed to train the machine to make classifications and predictions, based
    on the data obtained from the real world. Among the existing ML methods, deep
    learning, by leveraging artificial neural networks (ANNs) [16] to learn the deep
    representation of the data, has resulted in an amazing performance in multiple
    tasks, including image classification, face recognition, and so on. Since the
    ANN adopted by deep learning model typically consists of a series of layers, the
    model is called a deep neural network (DNN). As shown in Fig. 2, each layer of
    a DNN is composed of neurons that are able to generate the nonlinear outputs based
    on the data from the input of the neuron. Fig. 2. Standard composition of DL model.
    (a) Layers in a DL model. (b) Architecture of a neuron. Show All The neurons in
    the input layer receive the data and propagate them to the middle layer (also
    known as the hidden layer). Then, the neurons in the middle layer generate the
    weighted sums of the input data and output the weighted sums using the specific
    activation functions (e.g., tanh), and the outputs are then propagated to the
    output layer. The final results are presented at the output layer. With more complex
    and abstract layers than a typical model, DNNs are able to learn the high-level
    features, enabling high precision inference in tasks. Fig. 3 presents three popular
    structures of DNNs: multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), convolution neural networks
    (CNNs), and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Fig. 3. Three typical structures
    of DL models. (a) MLPs. (b) CNNs. (c) RNNs. Show All MLP models are the most basic
    DNN, which is composed of a series of fully connected layers [17]. Different from
    fully connected layers in MLPs, in CNN models, the convolution layers extract
    the simple features from input by executing convolution operations. Applying various
    convolutional filters, CNN models can capture the high-level representation of
    the input data, making it most popular for computer vision tasks, e.g., image
    classification (e.g., AlexNet [18], VGG network [19], ResNet [20], and MobileNet
    [21]) and object detection (e.g., Fast R-CNN [22], YOLO [23], and SSD [24]). RNN
    models are another type of DNNs, which use sequential data feeding. As shown in
    Fig. 3(c), the basic unit of RNN is called cell, and further, each cell consists
    of layers and a series of cells enables the sequential processing of RNN models.
    RNN models are widely used in the task of natural language processing, e.g., language
    modeling, machine translation, question answering, and document classification.
    Deep learning represents the state-of-the-art AI technology as well as a highly
    resource-demanding workload that naturally suits for edge computing. Therefore,
    due to space limitation, in the remaining of this paper, we will focus on the
    interaction between deep learning and edge computing. We believe that the techniques
    discussed can also have meaningful implications for other AI models and methods,
    i.e., stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is a popular training method for many
    AI/ML algorithms (e.g., k -means, support vector machine, and lasso regression)
    [25], and the optimization techniques of SGD training introduced in this paper
    can be also deployed on other AI models training process. C. From Deep Learning
    to Model Training and Inference For each neuron in a DNN layer, it has a vector
    of weights associated with the input data size of the layer. Needless to say,
    the weights in a deep learning model need to be optimized through a training process.
    In a training process for a deep learning model, the values of weights in the
    model are often randomly assigned initially. Then, the output of the last layer
    represents the task result, and a loss function is set to evaluate the correctness
    of the results by calculating the error rate (e.g., root-mean-squared error) between
    the results and the true label. To adjust the weights of each neuron in the model,
    an optimization algorithm, such as SGD [25], is used and the gradient of the loss
    function is calculated. Leveraging the backpropagation mechanism [26], [27], the
    error rate is propagated back across the whole neural network, and the weights
    are updated based on the gradient and the learning rate. By feeding a large number
    of training samples and repeating this process until the error rate is below a
    predefined threshold, a deep learning model with high precision is obtained. DNN
    model inference happens after training. For instance, for an image classification
    task, with the feeding of a large number of training samples, the DNN is trained
    to learn how to recognize an image, and then, inference takes real-world images
    as inputs and quickly draws the predictions/classifications of them. The training
    procedure consists of the feed-forward process and the backpropagation process.
    Note that the inference involves the feedforward process only, i.e., the input
    from the real world is passed through the whole neural network and the model outputs
    the prediction. D. Popular Deep Learning Models For a better understanding of
    the deep learning and their applications, in this section, we give an overview
    of various popular deep learning models. 1) Convolution Neural Network: For image
    classification, as the first CNN to win the ImageNet Challenge in 2012, AlexNet
    [18] consists of five convolution layers and three fully connected layers. AlexNet
    requires 61 million weights and 724 million MACs (multiply-add computation) to
    classify the image with a size of 227×227 . To achieve higher accuracy, VGG-16
    [19] is trained to a deeper structure of 16 layers consisting of 13 convolution
    layers and three fully connected layers, requiring 138 million weights and 15.5G
    MACs to classify the image with a size of 224×224 . To improve accuracy while
    reducing the computation of DNN inference, GoogleNet [28] introduces an inception
    module composed of different sized filters. GoogleNet achieves a better accuracy
    performance than VGG-16, while only requiring seven million weights and 1.43G
    MACs to process the image with the same size. ResNet [20], the state-of-the-art
    effort, uses the “shortcut” structure to reach a human-level accuracy with a top-5
    error rate below 5%. The “shortcut” module is used to solve the gradient vanishing
    problem during the training process, making it possible to train a DNN model with
    deeper structure. CNN is typically employed in computer vision. Given a series
    of images or video from the real world, with the utilization of CNN, the AI system
    learns to automatically extract the features of these inputs to complete a specific
    task, e.g., image classification, face authentication, and image semantic segmentation.
    2) Recurrent Neural Network: For sequential input data, RNNs have been developed
    to address the time-series problem. The input of RNN consists of the current input
    and the previous samples. Each neuron in an RNN owns an internal memory that keeps
    the information of the computation from the previous samples. The training of
    RNN is based on backpropagation through time (BPTT) [29]. Long short-term memory
    (LSTM) [30] is an extended version of RNNs. In LSTM, the gate is used to represents
    the basic unit of a neuron. As shown in Fig. 4, each neuron in LSTM is called
    memory cell and includes a multiplicative forget gate, input gate, and output
    gate. These gates are used to control the access to memory cells and to prevent
    them from perturbation by irrelevant inputs. Information is added or removed through
    the gate to the memory cell. Gates are different neural networks that determine
    what information is allowed on the memory cell. The forget gate can learn what
    information is kept or forgotten during training. RNN has been widely used in
    natural language processing due to the superiority of processing the data with
    an input length that is not fixed. The task of the AI here is to build a system
    that can comprehend natural language spoken by humans, e.g., natural language
    modeling, word embedding, and machine translation. Fig. 4. Structure of an LSTM
    memory cell. Show All 3) Generative Adversarial Network: As shown in Fig. 5, generative
    adversarial networks (GANs) [31] consists of two main components, namely, the
    generative and discriminator networks (i.e., generator and discriminator). The
    generator is responsible for generating new data after it learns the data distribution
    from a training data set of real data. The discriminator is in charge of classifying
    the real data from the fake data generated by the generator. GAN is often deployed
    in image generation, image transformation, image synthesis, image superresolution,
    and other applications. Fig. 5. Composition of a GAN. Show All 4) Deep Reinforcement
    Learning: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is composed of DNNs and RL. As illustrated
    in Fig. 6, the goal of DRL is to create an intelligent agent that can perform
    efficient policies to maximize the rewards of long-term tasks with controllable
    actions. The typical application of DRL is to solve various scheduling problems,
    such as decision problems in games, rate selection of video transmission, and
    so on. Fig. 6. Concept of a DRL model. Show All In the DRL approach, the RL searches
    for the optimal policy of actions over states from the environment, and the DNN
    is in charge of representing a large number of states and approximating the action
    values to estimate the quality of the action in the given states. The reward is
    a function to represent the distance between the predefined requirement and the
    performance of an action. Through continuous learning, the agent of DRL model
    can be used for various tasks, e.g., gaming [32]. SECTION III. Edge Intelligence
    The marriage of edge computing and AI gives the birth of EI. In this section,
    we discuss the motivation, benefits, and definition of EI. A. Motivation and Benefits
    of Edge Intelligence The fusion of AI and edge computing is natural since there
    is a clear intersection between them. Specifically, edge computing aims at coordinating
    a multitude of collaborative edge devices and servers to process the generated
    data in proximity, and AI strives for simulating intelligent human behavior in
    devices/machines by learning from data. Besides enjoying the general benefits
    of edge computing (e.g., low latency and reduced bandwidth consumption), pushing
    AI to the edge further benefits each other in the following aspects. 1) Data Generated
    at the Network Edge Need AI to Fully Unlock Their Potential: As a result of the
    proliferation of the skyrocketing number and types of mobile and IoT devices,
    large volumes of multimodal data (e.g., audio, picture, and video) of physical
    surroundings are continuously sensed at the device side. In this context, AI will
    be functionally necessary due to its ability to quickly analyze those huge data
    volumes and extract insights from them for high-quality decision making. As one
    of the most popular AI techniques, deep learning brings the ability to automatically
    identify patterns and detect anomalies in the data sensed by the edge device,
    as exemplified by population distribution, traffic flow, humidity, temperature,
    pressure, and air quality. The insights extracted from the sensed data are then
    fed to the real-time predictive decision-making (e.g., public transportation planning,
    traffic control, and driving alert) in response to the fast-changing environments,
    increasing the operational efficiency. As forecast by Gartner [33], more than
    80% of enterprise IoT projects will include an AI component by 2022, up from only
    10% today. 2) Edge Computing is Able to Prosper AI With Richer Data and Application
    Scenarios: It is widely recognized that the driving force behind the recent booming
    of deep learning is fourfold: algorithm, hardware, data, and application scenarios.
    While the effect of algorithm and hardware on the development of deep learning
    is intuitive, the role of data and application scenarios has been mostly overlooked.
    Specifically, to improve the performance of a deep learning algorithm, the most
    commonly adopted approach is to refine the DNN with more layers of neurons. By
    doing this, we need to learn more parameters in the DNN and so does the data required
    for training increase. This definitely demonstrates the importance of data on
    the development of AI. Having recognized the importance of data, the next problem
    is where are the data from. Traditionally, data are mostly born and stored in
    the megascale datacenters. Nevertheless, with the rapid development of IoT, the
    trend is reversing now. According to Cisco’s report [3], in the near future, massive
    IoT data will be generated at the edge side. If these data are processed by AI
    algorithms at the cloud data center, it will consume a lot of bandwidth resources
    and bring great pressure to the cloud data center. To address these challenges,
    edge computing is proposed to achieve low-latency data processing by sinking the
    computing capability from the cloud data center to the edge side, i.e., data generation
    source, which may enable AI processing with high performance. While edge computing
    and AI complement each other from a technical perspective, their application and
    popularization are also mutually beneficial. 3) AI Democratization Requires Edge
    Computing as a Key Infrastructure: AI technologies have witnessed great success
    in many digital products or services in our daily life, e.g., online shopping,
    service recommendation, video surveillance, smart home devices, and so on. AI
    is also a key driving force behind emerging innovative frontiers, such as self-driving
    cars, intelligent finance, cancer diagnosis, and medicine discovery. Beyond the
    above-mentioned examples, to enable a richer set of applications and push the
    boundaries of what is possible, AI democratization or ubiquitous AI [34] has been
    declared by major IT companies, with the vision of “making AI for every person
    and every organization at everywhere.” To this end, AI should go “closer” to the
    people, data, and end devices. Clearly, edge computing is more competent than
    cloud computing in achieving this goal. First, compared to the cloud datacenter,
    edge servers are in closer proximity to people, data source, and devices. Second,
    compared to cloud computing, edge computing is also more affordable and accessible.
    Finally, edge computing has the potential to provide more diverse application
    scenarios of AI than cloud computing. Due to these advantages, edge computing
    is naturally a key enabler for ubiquitous AI. 4) Edge Computing Can Be Popularized
    With AI Applications: During the early development of edge computing, there has
    always been the concern in the cloud computing community with which high-demand
    applications edge computing could take to the next level that cloud computing
    could not, and what are the killer applications of edge computing. To clear up
    the doubt, Microsoft has conducted continuous exploration on what kinds should
    be moved from the cloud to the edge since 2009 [35], ranging from voice command
    recognition, AR/VR, and interactive cloud gaming [36] to real-time video analytics.
    By comparison, real-time video analytics is envisioned to be a killer application
    for edge computing [12], [37], [38]. As an emerging application built on top of
    computer vision, real-time video analytics continuously pulls high-definition
    videos from surveillance cameras and requires high computation, high bandwidth,
    high privacy, and low latency to analyze the videos. The one viable approach that
    can meet these strict requirements is edge computing. Looking back to the above
    evolution of edge computing, it can be foreseen that novel AI applications emerged
    from the sectors such as IIoT, intelligent robots, smart cities, and smart home
    will play a crucial role in the popularization of edge computing. This is mainly
    due to the fact that many mobile and IoT related AI applications represent a family
    of practical applications that are computation- and energy-intensive, privacy-
    and delay- sensitive, and thus naturally align well with edge computing. Due to
    the superiority and necessity of running AI application on the edge, edge AI has
    recently received great attention. In December 2017, in a white paper, “A Berkeley
    View of Systems Challenges for AI” [39] published by the University of California
    Berkeley, the cloud–edge AI system is envisioned as an important research direction
    to achieve the goal of mission-critical and personalized AI. In August 2018, edge
    AI emerges in the Gartner Hype Cycle for the first time [40]. According to Gartners
    prediction, edge AI is still in the innovation trigger phase, and it will reach
    a plateau of productivity in the following five to ten years. In the industry,
    many pilot projects have also been carried out toward edge AI. Specifically, on
    the edge AI service platform, the traditional cloud providers, such as Google,
    Amazon, and Microsoft, have launched service platforms to bring the intelligence
    to the edge, through enabling end devices to run ML inferences with pretrained
    models locally. On edge AI chips, various high-end chips designated for running
    ML models have been made commercially available on the market, as exemplified
    by Google Edge TPU, Intel Nervana NNP, and Huawei Ascend 910 and Ascend 310. B.
    Scope and Rating of Edge Intelligence While the term edge AI or EI is brand new,
    explorations and practices in this direction have begun early. As aforementioned,
    in 2009, to demonstrate the benefits of edge computing, Microsoft has built an
    edge-based prototype to support mobile voice command recognition, an AI application.
    Albeit the early begin of exploration, there is still not a formal definition
    for EI. Currently, most organizations [41], [42] and presses [43] refer to EI
    as the paradigm of running AI algorithms locally on an end device, with data (sensor
    data or signals) that are created on the device. While this represents the current
    most common approach (e.g., with high-end AI chips) toward EI in the real world,
    it is crucial to note that this definition greatly narrows down the solution scope
    of EI. Running computation intensive algorithms as exemplified by DNN models locally
    is very resource-intensive, requiring high-end processors to be equipped in the
    device. Such a stringent requirement not only increases the cost of EI but is
    also incompatible and unfriendly to existing legacy end devices that have limited
    computing capacities. In this paper, we submit that the scope of EI should not
    be restricted to running AI models solely on the edge server or device. In fact,
    as demonstrated by a dozen recent studies, for DNN models, running them with edge-cloud
    synergy can reduce both the end-to-end latency and energy consumption when compared
    to the local execution approach. Due to these practical advantages, we believe
    that such collaborative hierarchy should be integrated into the design of efficient
    EI solutions. Furthermore, existing thoughts on EI mainly focus on the inference
    phase (i.e., running the AI model), assuming that the training of the AI model
    is performed in the power cloud datacenters since the resource consumption of
    the training phase significantly overweights the inference phase. However, this
    means that the enormous amount of training data should be shipped from devices
    or edges to the cloud, incurring prohibitive communication overhead as well as
    the concern on data privacy. Instead, we believe that EI should be the paradigm
    that fully exploits the available data and resources across the hierarchy of end
    devices, edge nodes, and cloud datacenters to optimize the overall performance
    of training and inferencing a DNN model. This indicates that EI does not necessarily
    mean that the DNN model is fully trained or inferenced at the edge but can work
    in a cloud–edge-device coordination manner via data offloading. Specifically,
    according to the amount and path length of data offloading, we rate EI into six
    levels, as shown in Fig. 7. Specifically, the definition of various levels of
    EI is given as follows. Cloud Intelligence: Training and inferencing the DNN model
    fully in the cloud. Level 1—Cloud–Edge Coinference and Cloud Training: Training
    the DNN model in the cloud, but inferencing the DNN model in an edge-cloud cooperation
    manner. Here edge-cloud cooperation means that data are partially offloaded to
    the cloud. Level 2—In-Edge Coinference and Cloud Training: Training the DNN model
    in the cloud, but inferencing the DNN model in an in-edge manner. Here in-edge
    means that the model inference is carried out within the network edge, which can
    be realized by fully or partially offloading the data to the edge nodes or nearby
    devices (via D2D communication). Level 3—On-Device Inference and Cloud Training:
    Training the DNN model in the cloud, but inferencing the DNN model in a fully
    local on-device manner. Here on-device means that no data would be offloaded.
    Level 4—Cloud–Edge Cotraining and Inference: Training and inferencing the DNN
    model both in the edge-cloud cooperation manner. Level 5—All In-Edge: Training
    and inferencing the DNN model both in the in-edge manner. Level 6—All On-Device:
    Training and inferencing the DNN model both in the on-device manner. Fig. 7. Six-level
    rating for EI. Show All As the level of EI goes higher, the amount and path length
    of data offloading reduce. As a result, the transmission latency of data offloading
    decreases, the data privacy increases, and the WAN bandwidth cost reduces. However,
    this is achieved at the cost of increased computational latency and energy consumption.
    This conflict indicates that there is no “best-level” in general; instead, the
    “best-level” EI is application-dependent and it should be determined by jointly
    considering multicriteria such as latency, energy efficiency, privacy, and WAN
    bandwidth cost. In the later sections, we will review enabling techniques as well
    as existing solutions for different levels of EI. SECTION IV. Edge Intelligence
    Model Training With the proliferation of mobile and IoT devices, data, which are
    essential for AI model training, are increasingly generated at the network edge.
    In this section, we focus on distributed training of DNN at the edge, including
    the architectures, key performance indicators, enabling techniques, and existing
    systems and frameworks. A. Architectures The architectures of distributed DNN
    training at the edge can be divided into three modes: centralized, decentralized,
    and hybrid (cloud–edge device). Fig. 8 shows the three architectures, illustrated
    in (a), (b), and (c), respectively. The cloud refers to the central datacenter,
    whereas the end devices are represented by mobile phones, cars, and surveillance
    cameras, which are also data sources. For the edge server, we use base stations
    as the legend. Fig. 8. Architecture modes of distributed training. (a) Centralized.
    (b) Decentralized. (c) Hybrid. Show All 1) Centralized: Fig. 8(a) describes a
    centralized DNN training, where the DNN model is trained in the cloud datacenter.
    The data for training are generated and gathered from distributed end devices
    such as mobile phones, cars, and surveillance cameras. Once the data are arrived,
    the cloud datacenter will perform DNN training using these data. Therefore, the
    system based on the centralized architecture can be identified in cloud intelligence,
    level 1, level 2, or ;evel 3 in Fig. 7 according to the specific inference mode
    that the system employs. 2) Decentralized: Under the decentralized mode as shown
    in Fig. 8(b), each computing node trains its own DNN model locally with local
    data, which preserves private information locally. To obtain the global DNN model
    by sharing local training improvement, nodes in the network will communicate with
    each other to exchange the local model updates. In this mode, the global DNN model
    can be trained without the intervention of the cloud datacenter, corresponding
    to the level 5 EI defined in Fig. 7. 3) Hybrid: The hybrid mode combines the centralized
    mode and the decentralized mode. As shown in Fig. 8(c), as the hub of the architecture,
    the edge servers may train the DNN model by either decentralized updates with
    each other or centralized training with the cloud datacenter; thus, the hybrid
    architecture covers level 4 and level 5 as shown in Fig. 7. The hybrid architecture
    is also called as cloud–edge device training due to the involved roles. B. Key
    Performance Indicators To better assess a distributed training method, there are
    six key performance indicators. 1) Training Loss: Essentially, the DNN training
    process solves an optimization problem that seeks to minimize the training loss.
    Since the training loss captures the gap between the learned (e.g., predicted)
    value and the labeled data, it indicates how well the trained DNN model fits the
    training data. Therefore, it is expected that the training loss can be minimized.
    Training loss is mainly affected by training samples and training methods. 2)
    Convergence: The convergence indicator is specialized for the decentralized methods.
    Intuitively, a decentralized method works only if the distributed training processes
    converge to a consensus, which is the training result of the method. The term
    convergence measures whether and how fast a decentralized method converges to
    such a consensus. Under the decentralized training mode, the convergence value
    depends on the way the gradient is synchronized and updated. 3) Privacy: When
    training the DNN model by using the data originated at a massive of end devices,
    the raw data or intermediate data should be transferred out of the end devices.
    Obviously, it is inevitable to deal with privacy issues in this scenario. To preserve
    privacy, it is expected that less privacy-sensitive data is transferred out of
    the end devices. Whether privacy protection is implemented depends on whether
    the raw data is offloaded to the edge. 4) Communication Cost: Training the DNN
    model is data-intensive since the raw data or intermediate data should be transferred
    across the nodes. Intuitively, this communication overhead increases the training
    latency, energy, and bandwidth consumption. Communication overhead is affected
    by the size of the original input data, the way of transmission, and the available
    bandwidth. 5) Latency: Arguably, latency is one of the most fundamental performance
    indicators of distributed DNN model training since it directly influences when
    the trained model is available for use. The latency of the distributed training
    process typically consists of the computation latency and the communication latency.
    The computation latency is tightly dependent on the capability of the edge nodes.
    The communication latency may vary from the size of transmitted raw or intermediate
    data and the bandwidth of network connection. 6) Energy Efficiency: When training
    the DNN model in a decentralized manner, both the computation and communication
    processes consume enormous energy. However, for most end devices, they are energy-constrained.
    As a result, it is highly desirable that the DNN model training is energy-efficient.
    Energy efficiency is mainly affected by the size of the target training model
    and resources of the used devices. It is worth noting that the performance indicators,
    training loss and convergence, are common objectives, and thus they may not be
    explicitly claimed by some literature on DNN training. C. Enabling Technologies
    In this section, we review the enabling technologies for improving one or more
    of the aforementioned key performance indicators when training the EI model. Table
    1 summarizes the highlights of each enabling technology. Table 1 Technologies
    for Distributed DNN Training at the Edge 1) Federated Learning: Federated learning
    is dedicated to optimizing privacy issue in the above-mentioned key performance
    indicators. Federated learning is an emerging yet promising approach to preserve
    privacy when training the DNN model based on data originated by multiple clients.
    Rather than aggregating the raw data to a centralized datacenter for training,
    federated learning [45] leaves the raw data distributed on the clients (e.g.,
    mobile devices) and trains a shared model on the server by aggregating locally
    computed updates. The main challenges of federated learning are optimization and
    communication. For the optimization problem, the challenge is to optimize the
    gradient of a shared model by the distributed gradient updates on mobile devices.
    On this issue, federated learning adopts SGD. SGD updates the gradient over extremely
    small subsets (minibatch) of the whole data set, which is a simple but widely
    used gradient descent method. Shokri and Shmatikov [46] design a selective SGD
    (SSGD) protocol, allowing the clients to train independently on their own data
    sets and selectively share small subsets of their model’s key parameters to the
    centralized aggregator. Since SGD is easy to be parallelized as well as asynchronously
    executed, SSGD targets both privacy and training loss. Specifically, while preserving
    client’s own privacy, the training loss can be reduced by sharing the models among
    clients, comparing to training solely on their own inputs. A flaw of [46] is that
    it does not consider unbalanced and nonindependent identical distribution (non-IID)
    data. As an extension, McMahan et al. [45] advocate a decentralized approach,
    termed as federated learning, and present FedAvg method for federated learning
    with the DNN based on iterative model averaging. Here, the iterative model averaging
    means that the clients update the model locally with one-step SGD and then the
    server averages the resulting models with weights. The optimization in [45] emphasizes
    the properties of unbalanced and non-IID since the distributed data may come from
    various sources. For the communication problem, it is the unreliable and unpredictable
    network that poses the challenge of communication efficiency. In federated learning,
    each client sends a full model or a full model update back to the server in a
    typical round. For large models, this step is likely to be the bottleneck due
    to the unreliable network connections. To decrease the number of rounds for training,
    McMahan et al. [45] propose to increase the computation of local updates on clients.
    However, it is impractical when the clients are under severe computation resources
    constraint. In response to this issue, Konečný et al. [47] propose to reduce communication
    cost with two new update schemes, namely, structured update and sketched update.
    In a structured update, the model directly learns an update from a restricted
    space parametrized using a smaller number of variables, e.g., either low-rank
    or a random mask. If using a sketched update, the model first learns a full model
    update and then compressed the update using a combination of quantization, random
    rotations, and subsampling before sending it to the server. Though the federated
    learning technique exploits a new decentralized deep learning architecture, it
    is built upon a central server for aggregating local updates. Considering the
    scenario of training a DNN model over a fully decentralized network, i.e., a network
    without a central server, Lalitha et al. [48] propose a Bayesian-based distributed
    algorithm, in which each device updates its belief by aggregating information
    from its one-hop neighbors to train a model that best fits the observations over
    the entire network. Furthermore, with the emerging blockchain technique, Kim et
    al. [49] propose blockchain federated learning (BlockFL) with the devices model
    update exchanged and verified by leveraging blockchain. BlockFL also works for
    a fully decentralized network, where the ML model can be trained without any central
    coordination even when some devices lack their own training data samples. 2) Aggregation
    Frequency Control: This method focuses on the optimization of communication overhead
    during the DNN model training. On training deep learning model in edge computing
    environment, a commonly adopted idea (e.g., federated learning) is to train distributed
    models locally first and then aggregate updates centrally. In this case, the control
    of updates aggregation frequency significantly influences the communication overhead.
    Thus, the aggregation process, including aggregation content as well as aggregation
    frequency, should be controlled carefully. Based on the above insight, Hsieh et
    al. [50] develop the Gaia system and the approximate synchronous parallel (ASP)
    model for geodistributed DNN model training. The basic idea of Gaia is to decouple
    the communication within a datacenter from the communication between datacenters,
    enabling different communication and consistency models for each. To this end,
    the ASP model is developed to dynamically eliminate insignificant communication
    between datacenters, where the aggregation frequency is controlled by the preset
    significance threshold. However, Gaia focuses on geodistributed datacenters that
    are capacity-unlimited, making it is not generally applicable to edge computing
    nodes whose capacity is highly constrained. To incorporate the capacity constraint
    of edge nodes, Wang et al. [51] propose a control algorithm that determines the
    best tradeoff between the local update and global parameter aggregation under
    a given resource budget. The algorithm is based on the convergence analysis of
    distributed gradient descent and can be applied to federated learning in edge
    computing with provable convergence. To implement federated learning in the capacity-limited
    edge computing environment, Nishio and Yonetani [52] study the client selection
    problem with resource constraints. In particular, an update aggregation protocol
    named FedCS is developed to allow the centralized server to aggregate as many
    client updates as possible and to accelerate performance improvement in ML models.
    An illustration of FedCS is shown in Fig. 9. Fig. 9. Overview of the FedCS protocol.
    Show All 3) Gradient Compression: To reduce the communication overhead incurred
    by decentralized training, gradient compression is another intuitive approach
    to compress the model update (i.e., gradient information). To this end, gradient
    quantization and gradient sparsification have been advocated. Specifically, gradient
    quantization performs lossy compression of the gradient vectors by quantizing
    each of their elements to a finite-bit low precision value. Gradient sparsification
    reduces the communication overhead by transmitting part of the gradient vectors.
    Lin et al. [53] observe that 99.9% of the gradient exchange in distributed SGD
    (DSGD) are redundant, which demonstrates the power of gradient compression. Based
    on this observation, Lin et al. propose deep gradient compression (DGC), which
    compresses the gradient by 270−600× for a wide range of CNNs and RNNs. To preserve
    accuracy during this compression, DGC employs four methods: momentum correction,
    local gradient clipping, momentum factor masking, and warm-up training. Inspired
    by [53], Tao and Li [54] propose edge SGD (eSGD), a family of sparse schemes with
    both convergence and practical performance guarantees. To improve the first-order
    gradient-based optimization of stochastic objective functions in edge computing,
    eSGD includes two mechanisms: 1) determine which gradient coordinates are important
    and only transmits these coordinates and 2) design momentum residual accumulation
    for tracking out-of-date residual gradient coordinates in order to avoid low convergence
    rate caused by sparse updates. A concise convergence analysis of sparsified SGD
    is given in [55], where SGD is analyzed with k -sparsification or compression
    (e.g., top- k or random- k ). The analysis shows that this scheme converges at
    the same rate as vanilla SGD when equipped with error compensation (keeping track
    of accumulated errors in memory). In other words, communication can be reduced
    by a factor of the dimension of the problem (sometimes even more) while still
    converging at the same rate. Quantizing the gradients to low-precision values
    can also reduce the communication bandwidth. In this regard, Tang et al. [56]
    develop a framework of compressed, decentralized training and propose two different
    algorithms, called extrapolation compression and difference compression, respectively.
    The analysis on the two algorithms proves that both converge at the rate of O(1/
    nT − − − √ ) , where n is the number of clients and T is the number of iterations,
    matching the convergence rate for full precision, centralized training. Amiri
    and Gunduz [57] implement DSGD at the wireless edge with the help of a remote
    parameter server and further develop DSGD in digital and analog schemes, respectively.
    Digital DSGD (D-DSGD) assumes that the clients operate on the boundary of the
    multiple-access channel (MAC) capacity region at each iteration of the DSGD algorithm
    and employs gradient quantization and error accumulation to transmit their gradient
    estimates within the bit budget allowed by the employed power allocation. In analog
    DSGD (A-DSGD), the clients first sparsify their gradient estimates with error
    accumulation and then project them to a lower dimensional space imposed by the
    available channel bandwidth. These projections are transmitted directly over the
    MAC without employing any digital code. 4) DNN Splitting: The aim of DNN splitting
    is to protect privacy. DNN splitting protects user privacy by transmitting partially
    processed data rather than transmitting raw data. To enable a privacy-preserving
    edge-based training of DNN models, DNN splitting is conducted between the end
    devices and the edge server. This is based on the important observation that a
    DNN model can be split inside between two successive layers with two partitions
    deployed on different locations without losing accuracy. An inevitable problem
    on DNN splitting is how to select the splitting point such that distributed DNN
    training is still under the latency requirement. On this problem, Mao et al. [58]
    utilize the differentially private mechanism and partitions DNN after the first
    convolutional layer to minimize the cost of mobile devices. The proof in [58]
    guarantees that applying differentially private mechanism on activations is feasible
    for outsourcing training tasks to untrusted edge servers. Wang et al. [59] consider
    this problem across mobile devices and cloud datacenters. To benefit from the
    computation power of cloud datacenters without privacy risks, Wang et al. [59]
    design Arden (privAte infeRence framework based on Deep nEural Networks), a framework
    that partitions the DNN model with a lightweight privacy-preserving mechanism.
    By arbitrary data nullification and random noise addition, Arden achieves privacy
    protection. Considering the negative impact of private perturbation to the original
    data, Wang et al. [59] use a noisy training method to enhance the cloud-side network
    robustness to perturbed data. Osia et al. [60] introduce a hybrid user-cloud framework
    on the privacy issue, which utilizes a private-feature extractor as its core component
    and breaking down large, complex deep models for cooperative, privacy-preserving
    analytics. In this framework, the feature extractor module is properly designed
    to output the private feature constrained to keep the primary information while
    discarding all the other sensitive information. Three different techniques are
    employed to make sensitive measures unpredictable: dimensionality reduction, noise
    addition, and Siamese fine-tuning. When applying DNN splitting for privacy-preserving,
    it is remarkable that this technique also works for dealing with the tremendous
    computation of DNN. Exploiting the fact that edge computing usually involves a
    large number of devices, parallelization approaches are usually employed to manage
    DNN computation. DNN training in parallel includes two kinds of parallelism: data
    parallelism and model parallelism. However, data parallelism may bring heavy overhead
    of communication, while model parallelism usually leads to severe underutilization
    of computation resources. To address these problems, Harlap et al. [61] propose
    pipeline parallelism, an enhancement to model parallelism, where multiple minibatches
    are injected into the system at once to ensure efficient and concurrent use of
    computation resources. Based on pipeline parallelism, Harlap et al. [61] design
    PipeDream, a system that supports pipelined training and automatically determines
    how to systematically split a given model across the available computing nodes.
    PipeDream shows the advantage of reducing communication overhead and utilizing
    computing resource efficiently. The overview of PipeDream’s automated mechanism
    is shown in Fig. 10. Fig. 10. PipeDreams automated mechanism. Show All 5) Knowledge
    Transfer Learning: Knowledge transfer learning, or transfer learning for simplicity,
    is closely connected with DNN splitting technique. In transfer learning, for the
    purpose of reducing DNN model training energy cost on edge devices, we first train
    a base network (teacher network) on a base data set, and then, we repurpose the
    learned features, i.e., transfer them to the second target network (student network)
    to be trained on a target data set. This process will tend to work if the features
    are general (i.e., suitable to both base and target tasks) instead of specific
    to the base task. The transition involves a process from generality to specificity.
    The approach of transfer learning seems to be promising for learning on edge devices
    since it has greatly reduced resource demand, but a thorough investigation on
    its effectiveness is lacking. To bridge this gap, Sharma et al. [62] and Chen
    et al. [44] provide extensive studies on the performance (in both accuracy and
    convergence speed) of transfer learning, considering different student network
    architectures and different techniques for transferring knowledge from teacher
    to student. The result varies with architectures and transfer techniques. A good
    performance improvement is obtained by transferring knowledge from both the intermediate
    layers and last layer of the teacher to a shallower student while other architectures
    and transfer techniques do not fare so well and some of them even lead to negative
    performance impact. Transfer learning technique regards the shallow layers of
    a pretrained DNN on one data set as a generic feature extractor that can be applied
    to other target tasks or data sets. With this feature, transfer learning is employed
    in many pieces of research and inspires the design of some frameworks. Osia et
    al. [60], which we have mentioned in Section IVC4, use transfer learning to determine
    the degree of generality and particularity of a private feature. Arden, proposed
    in [59], partitions a DNN across the mobile device and the cloud data center,
    where the raw data are transformed by the shallow portions of the DNN on the mobile
    device side. As [59] referred, the design of DNN splitting in Arden is inspired
    by transfer learning. 6) Gossip Training: Aiming at shortening the training latency,
    gossip training is a new decentralized training method, which is built on randomized
    gossip algorithms. The early work on random gossip algorithms is gossip averaging
    [63], which can fast converge toward a consensus among nodes by exchanging information
    peer to peer. The gossip distributed algorithms enjoy the advantage of full asynchronization
    and total decentralization as they have no requirement on centralized nodes or
    variables. Inspired by this, Gossip SGD (GoSGD) [64] is proposed to train DNN
    models in an asynchronous and decentralized way. GoSGD manages a group of independent
    nodes, where each of them hosts a DNN model and iteratively proceeds two steps:
    gradient update and mixing update. Specifically, each node updates its hosted
    DNN model locally in gradient update step and then shares its information with
    another randomly selected node in mixing update step, as shown in Fig. 11. The
    steps repeat until all the DNN converge on a consensus. Fig. 11. Communication
    with randomly selected partner in gossip manner. Show All The aim of GoSGD is
    to address the issue of speeding up the training of convolutional networks. Instead,
    another gossip-based algorithm, gossiping SGD [65], is designed to retain the
    positive features of both synchronous and asynchronous SGD methods. Gossiping
    SGD replaces the all-reduce collective operation of synchronous training with
    a gossip aggregation algorithm, achieving an asynchronous manner. Both Blot et
    al. [64] and Jin et al. [65] apply gossip algorithms on the updates of SGD, but
    neither of them has performance convergence degradation at large scale. By deployment
    on large-scale systems, Daily et al. [66] show that the trivial gossip-based algorithms
    at scale lead to a communication imbalance, poor convergence, and heavy communication
    overhead. To mitigate these issues, Daily et al. [66] introduce GossipGraD, a
    gossip communication protocol-based SGD algorithm that is practical for scaling
    deep learning algorithms on large-scale systems. GossipGrad reduces the overall
    communication complexity from Θ(log(p)) to O(1) and considers diffusion such that
    computing nodes exchange their updates (gradients) indirectly after every log(p)
    steps. It also considers the rotation of communication partners for facilitating
    direct diffusion of gradients and asynchronous distributed sample shuffling during
    the feedforward phase in SGD to prevent overfitting. D. Summary of Existing Systems
    and Frameworks In this section, we summary the systems and framework for distributed
    EI model training on the edge. An overview of the above-mentioned existing systems
    and frameworks is given in Table 2, including the architecture, EI level, objectives,
    employed technologies, and effectiveness. Table 2 Overview of Systems and Frameworks
    on EI Model Training In general, a key challenge for distributed EI model training
    is the data privacy issue. It is because the distributed data sources may originate
    from individual persons and different organizations. For users, they may be sensitive
    to their own private data, not allowing any private information to be shared.
    For companies, they have to consider the privacy policy to avoid legal subpoenas
    and extrajudicial surveillance. Therefore, the design of distributed training
    systems needs to carefully consider privacy preservation. Systems considering
    privacy issue in Table 2 include FedAvg, BlockFL, GossipGraD, and so on. The decentralized
    architecture is naturally friendly to user’s privacy, for which the systems that
    are based on the decentralized architecture such as BlockFL and GossipGraD typically
    preserve privacy better. By contrast, the centralized architecture involves a
    centralized data collection operation, and the hybrid architecture requires a
    data transmission operation. For this reason, the systems based on these two architectures
    would implement more extra efforts in data privacy protection. Compared with the
    DNN training under the cloud-based framework, the DNN training under edge-based
    framework pays more attention to protecting users’ privacy and training an available
    deep learning model faster. Under cloud-based training, a large amount of raw
    data generated at the client side is directly transmitted to the cloud data center
    through the long WAN, which not only causes hidden dangers of user privacy leakage
    but also consumes huge bandwidth resources. Moreover, in some scenarios such as
    military and disaster applications when access to the cloud center is impossible,
    the edge-based training will be highly desirable. On the other hand, the cloud
    data center can collect a larger amount of data and train an AI model with more
    powerful resources, and hence, the advantage of cloud intelligence is that it
    can train a much larger-scale and more accurate model. SECTION V. Edge Intelligence
    Model Inference After the distributed training of deep learning model, the efficient
    implementation of model inference at the edge will be critical for enabling high-quality
    EI service deployment. In this section, we discuss the DNN model inference at
    the edge, including the architectures, key performance indicators, enabling techniques,
    and existing systems and frameworks. A. Architectures Besides the common cloud-based
    and device-cloud inference architectures, we further define several major edge-centric
    inference architectures and classify them into four DNN model inference modes,
    namely, edge-based, device-based, edge-device, and edge-cloud modes, which are
    illustrated in Fig. 12(a)–(d), respectively. We describe the main workflow of
    each mode as follows. Fig. 12. Major edge-centric inference modes. (a) Edge-based
    mode. (b) Device-based mode. (c) Edge-device mode. (d) Edge-cloud mode. Show All
    1) Edge-Based Mode: In Fig. 12(a), device A is in the edge-based mode, which means
    that the device receives the input data then send them to the edge server. When
    the DNN model inference is done at the edge server, the prediction results will
    be returned to the device. In this inference mode, since the DNN model is on the
    edge server, it is easy to implement the application on different mobile platforms.
    However, the main disadvantage is that the inference performance depends on network
    bandwidth between the device and the edge server. 2) Device-Based Mode: In Fig.
    12(b), device B is in the device-based mode. The mobile device obtains the DNN
    model from the edge server and performs the model inference locally. During the
    inference process, the mobile device does not communicate with the edge server.
    Therefore, the inference is reliable, but it requires a large amount of resources
    such as CPU, GPU, and RAM on the mobile device. The performance depends on the
    local device itself. 3) Edge-Device Mode: In Fig. 12(c), device C is in the edge-device
    mode. In the edge-device mode, the device first partitions the DNN model into
    multiple parts according to the current system environmental factors such as network
    bandwidth, device resource, and edge server workload. Then, the device will execute
    the DNN model up to a specific layer and send the intermediate data to the edge
    server. The edge server will execute the remaining layers and sends the prediction
    results to the device. Compared to the edge-based and device-based modes, the
    edge-device mode is more reliable and flexible. It may also require huge resource
    on the mobile device because the convolution layers at the front position of a
    DNN model are computational-intensive generally. 4) Edge-Cloud Mode: In Fig. 12(d),
    device D is in the edge-cloud mode. It is similar to the edge-device mode and
    is suitable for the case that the device is highly resource constrained. In this
    mode, the device is responsible for input data collection, and the DNN model is
    executed through edge-cloud synergy. The performance of this model heavily depends
    on the network connection quality. We should emphasize that the above-mentioned
    four edge-centric inference modes can be adopted in a system simultaneously to
    carry out complex AI model inference tasks (e.g., cloud–edge-device hierarchy),
    by efficiently pooing heterogeneous resources across a multitude of end devices,
    edge nodes, and clouds. B. Key Performance Indicators To describe the service
    quality of the EI model inference, we introduce the following five metrics. 1)
    Latency: Latency refers to the time spent in the whole inference process, including
    preprocessing, model inference, data transmission, and postprocessing. For some
    real-time intelligent mobile applications (e.g., AR/VR mobile gaming and intelligent
    robots), they usually have stringent deadline requirement such as 100-ms latency.
    Latency indicator is affected by many factors, including the resources on edge
    devices, the way of data transmission, and the way to execute the DNN model. 2)
    Accuracy: Accuracy refers to the ratio of the number of the input samples that
    get the correct predictions from inference to the total number of input samples,
    reflecting the performance of the DNN models. For some mobile applications requiring
    a high level of reliability, such as self-driving car and face authentication,
    they demand the ultrahigh accuracy on the DNN model inference. Besides the DNN
    model’s own inference capability, the inference accuracy depends on the speed
    of feeding the input data to the DNN model. For a video analytics application,
    under a fast feeding rate, some input samples may be skipped due to the edge device’s
    constraint resources, causing a drop in accuracy. 3) Energy: To execute a DNN
    model, compared with the edge server and the cloud data center, the end devices
    are usually battery-limited. The computation and communication overheads of DNN
    model inference bring a large amount of energy consumption. For an EI application,
    energy efficiency is of great importance and is affected by the size of the DNN
    model and the resources on edge devices. 4) Privacy: IoT and mobile devices generate
    a huge amount of data, which could be privacy sensitive. Thus, it is also important
    to protect privacy and data security near the data source for an EI application
    during the model inference stage. Privacy protection depends on the way of processing
    the original data. 5) Communication Overhead: Except for the device-based mode,
    the communication overhead affects the inference performance of the other modes
    greatly. It is necessary to minimize the overhead during the DNN model inference
    in an EI application, particularly the expensive WAN bandwidth usage for the cloud.
    Communication overhead here mainly depends on the mode of DNN inference and the
    available bandwidth. 6) Memory Footprint: Optimizing the memory footprint of performing
    DNN model inference on mobile devices is very necessary. On the one hand, typically,
    a high-precision DNN model is accompanied by millions of parameters, which is
    very hungry for the hardware resources of mobile devices. On the other hand, unlike
    high-performance discrete GPUs on the cloud data center, there is no dedicated
    high-bandwidth memory for mobile GPUs on mobile devices [69]. Moreover, mobile
    CPUs and GPUs typically compete for shared and scarce memory bandwidths. For the
    optimization of the DNN inference at the edge side, the memory footprint is a
    nonnegligible indicator. Memory footprint is mainly affected by the size of the
    original DNN model and the way of loading the tremendous DNN parameters. C. Enabling
    Technologies In this section, we review the enabling technologies for improving
    one or more of the aforementioned key performance indicators for EI model inference.
    Table 3 summarizes the highlights of each enabling technology. Table 3 Technologies
    for Distributed DNN inference at the Edge 1) Model Compression: To alleviate the
    tension between resource-hungry DNNs and resource-poor end devices, DNN compression
    has been commonly adopted to reduce the model complexity and resource requirement,
    enabling local, on-device inference that, in turn, reduces the response latency
    and has fewer privacy concerns. That is, the model compression method optimizes
    the above four indicators; latency, energy, privacy, and memory footprint. Various
    DNN compression techniques have been proposed, including weight pruning, data
    quantization, and compact architecture design. Weight pruning represents the most
    widely adopted technique of model compression. This technique removes redundant
    weights (i.e., connections between neurons) from a trained DNN. Specifically,
    it first ranks the neurons in the DNN according to how much the neuron contributes
    and then removes the low-ranking neurons to reduce the model size. Since removing
    neurons damages the accuracy of the DNN, then how to reduce the network size meanwhile
    preserving the accuracy is the key challenge. For modern large-scale DNNs, a pilot
    research in [70] tackled this challenge by applying a magnitude-based weight pruning
    method. The basic idea of this method is as follows: first, remove small weights
    whose magnitudes are below a threshold (e.g., 0.001) and then fine-tune the model
    to restore the accuracy. For AlexNet and VGG-16, this method can reduce the number
    of weights by 9× and 13× with no loss of accuracy on ImageNet. The follow-up work
    deep compression [71], which blends the advantages of pruning, weight sharing,
    and Huffman coding to compress DNNs, further pushes the compression ratio to 35–
    49× . However, for energy-constrained end devices, the above magnitude-based weight
    pruning method may not be directly applicable since empirical measurements show
    that the reduction in the number of weights does not necessarily translate into
    significant energy saving [72]. This is because for DNNs as exemplified by AlexNet,
    the energy of the convolutional layers dominates the total energy cost, while
    the number in the fully connected layers contributes most of the total number
    of weights in the DNN. This suggests that the number of weights may not be a good
    indicator for energy, and the weight pruning should be directly energy-aware for
    end devices. As the first step toward this end, an online DNN energy estimation
    tool (https://energyestimation.mit.edu/) has been developed by MIT to enable fast
    and easy DNN energy estimation. This fine-grained tool profiles the energy for
    the data movement from different levels of the memory hierarchy, the number of
    MACs, and the data sparsity at the granularity of the DNN layer. Based on this
    energy estimation tool, an energy-aware pruning method called EAP [73] is proposed.
    Another mainstream technique for model compression is data quantization. Instead
    of adopting the 32-bit floating point format, this technique uses a more compact
    format to represent layer inputs, weights, or both. Since representing a number
    with fewer bits reduces memory footprint and accelerates computation, data quantization
    improves the overall computation and energy efficiency. Most of the prior proposals
    for quantization tune the bit-width only for a fixed number type in an ad hoc
    manner, which may lead to a suboptimal result. To address this issue, the recent
    work [76] investigated the problem of optimal number representations at the layer
    granularity, in terms of finding the optimal bit-width for the canonical format
    based on the IEEE 754 Standard. This problem is challenging due to the combinatorial
    explosion of feasible number formats. In response, the authors developed a portable
    API called number abstract data type (ADT). It enables users to declare the data
    to be quantized in a layer (e.g., inputs, weights, or both) as number type. By
    doing so, ADT encapsulates the internal representation of a number, thus separating
    the concern for developing an effective DNN from the concern of optimizing the
    number representation at a bit level. While most existing efforts use a single
    compression technique, they may not suffice to meet the diverse requirements and
    constraints on accuracy, latency, storage, and energy imposed by some IoT devices.
    Emerging studies have shown how different compression techniques can be coordinated
    to maximally compress DNN models. For example, both deep compression [71] and
    Minerva [74] combine weight pruning and data quantization to enable fast, low-power,
    and highly accurate DNN inference. More recently, researchers argue that for a
    given DNN, the combination of compression techniques should be selected on demand,
    i.e., adapting to the application-driven system performance (e.g., accuracy, latency,
    and energy) and the varying resource availability across platforms (e.g., storage
    and processing capability). To this end, the proposed automatic optimization framework
    AdaDeep [75] systematically formulates the goals and constraints on accuracy,
    latency, storage, and energy into a unified optimization problem and leverages
    DRL to effectively find a good combination of compression techniques. 2) Model
    Partition: To alleviate the pressure of the EI application execution on end devices,
    as shown in Fig. 13, one intuitive idea is the model partition, offloading the
    computational-intensive part to the edge server or the nearby mobile devices,
    obtaining a better model inference performance. Model partition mainly cares about
    the issues of latency, energy, and privacy. Fig. 13. Illustration for model partition
    between devices and edge server. Show All The model partition can be divided into
    two types: partition between server and device and partition between devices.
    For the model partition between the server and the device, Neurosurgeon [79] represents
    an iconic effort. In Neurosurgeon, the DNN model is partitioned between the device
    and the server, and the key challenge is to figure out one suitable partition
    point to get the optimal model inference performance. Considering latency aspect
    and energy efficiency aspect, respectively, the authors propose a regression-based
    method to estimate the latency of each layer in the DNN model and return an optimal
    partition point that makes the model inference meet latency requirement or energy
    requirement. Hereafter, Ko et al. [83] propose an edge-host partitioning method,
    which combines model partition with lossy feature encoding. That is, the intermediate
    data after model partition will be compressed using lossy feature encoding before
    transmission. Also, jointly leveraging model partition and lossy feature encoding,
    the JALAD [81] framework formulates the model partition as an integer linear programming
    (ILP) problem to minimize the model inference latency under a guaranteed accuracy
    constraint. For DNNs those are characterized by a directed acyclic graph (DAG)
    rather than a chain, optimizing the model partition to minimize the latency is
    proven to be NP-hard in general. In response, Hu et al. [80] propose an approximation
    algorithm that provides the worst case performance guarantee, based on the graph
    min-cut method. The above-mentioned frameworks all have an assumption that the
    server has the DNN model of the EI application. IONN [82] propose an incremental
    offloading technique for EI application. IONN partitions the DNN layers and incrementally
    uploads them to allow collaborative DNN model inference by mobile devices and
    the edge server. Compared to the approach that uploads the entire model, IONN
    significantly improves query performance and energy consumption during DNN model
    uploading. Another type of model partition is the partition between devices. As
    the pioneering effort of model partition between devices, MoDNN [85] introduces
    a WiFi direct technique to build a microscale computing cluster in WLAN with multiple
    authorized WiFi-enabled mobile devices for partitioned DNN model inference. The
    mobile device that carries the DNN task will be the group owner and the others
    act as the worker nodes. Two partition schemes are proposed in MoDNN to accelerate
    DNN layer execution. The experiment shows that with two to four worker nodes,
    MoDNN accelerates the DNN model inference by 2.17–4.28 × . In the follow-up work
    MeDNN [84], greedy 2-D partition is proposed to adaptively partition the DNN model
    into multiple mobile devices and utilize a structured sparsity pruning technique
    to compress the DNN model. MeDNN improves the DNN model inference by 1.86–2.44
    × with two to four worker nodes and saves 26.5% of additional computing time and
    14.2% of extra communication time. Note that DNN layers are partitioned horizontally
    in MoDNN and MeDNN, whereas DeepThings [86] employs a fused tile partitioning
    method that partitions the DNN layers vertically to reduce the memory footprint.
    DeepX [77] also tries to partition DNN models but it only partitions the DNN model
    into several submodels and distributes them on local processors. DeepX proposes
    two schemes: runtime layer compression (RLC) and deep architecture decomposition
    (DAD). The layer after compression will be executed by specific local processors
    (CPU, GPU, and DSP). An additional note is that when we have multiple tasks of
    model partition, we need to make optimization for the scheduler. LEO [113] is
    a novel sensing algorithm scheduler that maximizes the performance for multiple
    continuous mobile sensor applications by partitioning the sensing algorithm execution
    and distributing tasks on CPU, coprocessor, GPU and the cloud. 3) Model Early
    Exit: A DNN model with a high accuracy usually has a deep structure. It consumes
    a large number of resources to execute such a DNN model on the end device. To
    accelerate model inference, the model early-exit method leverages output data
    of early layer to get the classification result, which means that the inference
    process is finished by using the partial DNN model. Latency is the optimization
    target of model early exit. BranchyNet [87] is a programming framework that implements
    the model early-exit mechanism. With BranchyNet, the standard DNN model structure
    is modified by adding exit branches at certain layer locations. Each exit branch
    is an exit point and shares part of DNN layers with the standard DNN model. Fig.
    14 shows a CNN model with three five points. The input data can be classified
    at these diverse early-exit points. Fig. 14. CNN model with five exit points.
    Show All Based on BranchyNet, a framework named DDNNs [88] for distributed DNNs
    across the cloud, edge, and devices is proposed. DDNNs have a three-layer structure
    framework, including device layer, edge server layer, and cloud layer. Each layer
    represents an exit point of BranchyNet. Three aggregation methods, including max
    pooling (MP), average pooling (AP), and concatenation (CC), are proposed. The
    aggregation methods work when multiple mobile devices send intermediate to an
    edge server or when multiple edge servers send intermediate data to the cloud
    data center. MP aggregates the data vectors by taking the maximum of each component.
    AP aggregates the data vectors by taking the average of each component. CC just
    simply concatenates the data vectors as one vector. Also, built on top of BranchyNet,
    Edgent [10] is proposed to navigate the accuracy-latency tradeoff when jointly
    applying model early-exit and model partition. The basic idea of Edgent is to
    maximize the accuracy under a given latency requirement via the regression-based
    layer latency prediction model. In addition to BranchyNet, there are different
    methods to implement model early exit. For example, the cascading network [91]
    simply adds the MP layer and fully connected layer to the standard DNN model and
    achieves a speedup of 20%. DeepIns [15] proposes a manufacture inspection system
    for the smart industry using DNN model early exit. In DeepIns, edge devices are
    responsible for data collection, the edge server acts as the first exit point,
    and the cloud data center acts as the second exit point. Then, Lo et al. [90]
    propose adding an authentic operation (AO) unit to the basic BranchyNet model.
    The AO unit determines whether an input has to be transferred to the edge server
    or cloud data center for further execution by setting different threshold criteria
    of a confidence level for different DNN model output classes. Bolukbasi et al.
    [89] train a policy that determines whether the current samples should proceed
    to the next layer by adding regularization to the evaluation latency of the DNN
    model. 4) Edge Caching: Edge caching is a new kind of method used to accelerate
    DNN model inference, i.e., optimizing the latency issue by caching the DNN inference
    results. The core idea of edge caching is to cache and reuse the task results
    such as the prediction of image classification at the network edge, reducing the
    querying latency of EI application. Fig. 15 shows the basic process of the semantic
    cache technique; if the request from mobile devices hits the cached results stored
    in the edge server, the edge server will return the result, otherwise, the request
    will be transferred to the cloud data center for inference with the model of full
    precision. Fig. 15. Process of the semantic cache technique. Show All Glimpse
    [92] is a pioneering effort to introduce cache technique to DNN inference task.
    For an object detection application, Glimpse proposes to reuse the stale detection
    result to detect the object on current frames. The results of the detected object
    of the stale frames are cached on the mobile devices, and then, Glimpse extracts
    a subset of these cached results and computes the optical flow of features between
    the processed frames and the current frame. The computing results of optical flow
    will guide us to move the bounding box to the right location in the current frame.
    Glimpse achieves an acceleration of 1.6–5.5 × . However, caching results locally
    do not scale beyond tens of images, then Cachier [93] is proposed to achieve recognition
    of thousands of objects. In Cachier, results of EI application are cached in the
    edge server, storing the features of input (e.g., image) and the corresponding
    task results. Then, Cachier uses the least frequently used (LFS) as the cache
    replacement strategy. If the input cannot hit the cache, the edge server will
    transfer the input to the cloud data center. Cachier can increase responsiveness
    by 3× or more. Precog [94] is the extension of Cachier. In Precog, the cached
    data are not only stored in the edge server but also in the mobile device. Precog
    uses predictions of Markov chains to prefetch data onto the mobile device and
    reach a speedup of 5× . In addition, Precog also proposes to dynamically adjust
    the cached feature extraction model on the mobile device according to the environment
    information. Shadow Puppets is another improved version of Cachier. Cachier extracts
    features from the input using the standard feature extraction like locality-sensitive
    hashing (LSH), but these features may not reflect the similarity as precise as
    the human dose. Then, in Shadow Puppets [96], it uses a small-footprint DNN to
    generate hash codes to represent the input data and get a remarkable latency improvement
    of 5– 10× . Considering the application scenario that the same application runs
    on multiple devices in close proximity and the DNN model often processes similar
    input data, FoggyCache [95] is proposed to minimize these redundant computations.
    There are two challenges in FoggyCache: one is that the input data distribution
    is unknown so the problem is how to index the input data with a constant lookup
    quality and the other is how to represent the similarity of the input data. To
    address these two challenges, FoggyCache proposes adaptive LSH (A-LSH) and homogenized
    kNN (H-kNN) schemes, respectively. FoggyCache reduces computation latency and
    energy consumption by a factor of 3× to 10× . 5) Input Filtering: Input filtering
    is an efficient method to accelerate DNN model inference, especially for the video
    analytics. As shown in Fig. 16, the key idea of input filtering is to remove the
    nontarget-object frames of input data, avoiding redundant computation of the DNN
    model inference, thus improving inference accuracy, shortening inference latency,
    and reducing energy cost. Fig. 16. Workflow of input filtering. Show All NoScope
    [97] is proposed to accelerate video analysis by skipping the frames that have
    little change. To this end, NoScope implements a difference detector that highlights
    temporal differences across frames, for example, the detector monitors the frames
    to check whether cars appear in the frames and the frame with cars will be processed
    in the DNN model inference. The difference is detected by using lightweight binary
    classifiers. In a scenario of continuous video transmission from a swarm of drones,
    Wang et al. [98] optimize for the first hop wireless bandwidth of DNN inference.
    In particular, four strategies are proposed to reduce total transmission: EarlyDiscard,
    Just-in-Time-Learning (JITL), Reachback, and Context-Aware. FFS-VA [100] is a
    pipelined system for multistage video analytics. There are three stages to build
    the filtering system of FFS-VA. The first is a stream-specialized different detector
    (SDD) that is used to remove the frames only containing a background. The second
    is a stream-specialized network model (SNM) to identify target-object frames.
    The third is a Tiny-YOLO-Voc (T-YOLO) model to remove the frames whose target
    objects are fewer than a threshold. Canel et al. [101] propose a two-stage filtering
    system for video analytics. It first extracts the semantic content of the frames
    by outputting the intermediate data of DNN, and then, these output features are
    accumulated in a frame buffer. The buffer is viewed as a DAG, and the filtering
    system uses the Euclidean distance as the similarity metric to figure out top-
    k interesting frames. The above-mentioned frameworks focus on filtering uninteresting
    frames of a video stream for a single camera. ReXCam [99] accelerates DNN model
    inference on cross-camera analytics. The ReXCam leverages a learned spatiotemporal
    model to filter video frames. ReXCam reduces computation workload by 4.6 × and
    improves DNN model inference accuracy by 27%. 6) Model Selection: Model selection
    method is proposed to optimize the DNN inference issue of latency, accuracy, and
    energy. The main idea of model selection is that we can first train a set of DNN
    models for the same task with various model sizes offline and then adaptively
    select the model for inference online. Model selection is similar to the model
    early exit, and the exit point of the model early-exit mechanism can be viewed
    as a DNN model. However, the key difference is that the exit point shares part
    of DNN layers with the main branch model, and the models in the model selection
    mechanism are independent. Park et al. [102] propose a big/little DNN model selection
    framework. That is, a little and fast model is used to try to classify the input
    data and the big model is only used when the confidence of the little model is
    less than a predefined threshold. Taylor et al. [103] point out that different
    DNN models (e.g., MobileNet, ResNet, and Inception) reach the lowest inference
    latency or highest accuracy on different evaluation metrics (top-1 or top-5) for
    different images. Then, they propose a framework for selecting the best DNN in
    terms of latency and accuracy. In this framework, a model selector is trained
    to select the best DNN for different input images. Similarly, IF-CNN [105] also
    trains a model selector called the recognition predictor (RP) to change the model
    used in the task. RP is a DNN model of multitask, meaning that RP has multiple
    outputs. The output of RP represents the probability of top-1 label of each candidate
    DNN model. The input of RP is the image and if the output of RP is over the predefined
    threshold, the corresponding DNN model will be selected. Besides the optimization
    for DNN model inference latency, aiming at energy saving, Stamoulis et al. [106]
    cast the adaptive DNN model selection issue as a hyperparameter optimization problem
    by taking into account the accuracy and communication constraints imposed by the
    devices. Then, a Bayesian optimization (BO) is adopted to solve this problem,
    achieving an improvement by up to 6× in terms of minimum energy per image under
    accuracy constraints. 7) Support for Multitenancy: In practice, an end or edge
    device typically runs more than one DNN applications concurrently. For example,
    the advanced driver-assistance system (ADAS) for Internet vehicles simultaneously
    runs DNN programs for vehicle detection, pedestrian detection, traffic sign recognition,
    and lane line detection. In this case, multiple DNN applications would compete
    for limited resource. Without careful support for multitenancy, i.e., resource
    allocation and task scheduling for those concurrent applications, the global efficiency
    would be greatly deteriorated. The support for multitenancy focuses on the optimization
    of energy and memory footprint. Taking the dynamics of runtime resources into
    consideration, NestDNN [107] is proposed to offering flexible resource–accuracy
    tradeoffs for each DNN model. NestDNN implements a new model pruning and recovery
    scheme, transforming the DNN model into a single compact multicapacity model that
    consists of a set of descendent models. Each descendent model offers a unique
    resource–accuracy tradeoff. For each concurrent descendent model, NestDNN encodes
    its accuracy and latency into a cost function and then builds a resource–accuracy
    runtime scheduler to make the optimal tradeoff for each concurrent descendent
    model. Also, addressing the challenge of enabling flexible tradeoffs, Mainstream
    [110] uses the popular transfer-learning DNN training method to train multiple
    DNN models with different degrees of accuracy and implements a greedy approach
    to find the optimal scheduler that fits the cost budget. For multiple DNN model
    executions on one single device, HiveMind [111] is proposed to improve the GPU
    utilization for these concurrent workloads. HiveMind consists of two key components:
    a compiler and a runtime module. The compiler optimizes the data transmission,
    data preprocessing, and computation across the workloads, and then, the runtime
    module transforms the optimized models into an execution DAG, which will be executed
    on the GPU while trying to extract as much concurrency as possible. At a finer
    granularity, DeepEye [108] is proposed to optimize the inference of multitask
    on the mobile device by scheduling the executions of heterogeneous DNN layers.
    DeepEye first segregates DNN layers of all tasks into two pools: convolution layers
    and fully connected layers. For the convolution layers, a first-in(endash)first-out
    (FIFO) queue-based execution strategy is employed. For the fully connected layers,
    DeepEye adopts a greedy approach for caching the parameters of the fully connected
    layers to maximize memory utilization. 8) Application-Specific Optimization: While
    the above-mentioned optimizing techniques are generally applicable to EI applications,
    application-specific optimization can be exploited to further optimize the performance
    of EI applications, i.e., accuracy, latency, energy, and memory footprint. For
    example, for video-based applications, two knobs, i.e., frame rate and resolution,
    can be flexibly adjusted to reduce resource demand. However, since such resource-sensitive
    knobs also deteriorate the inference accuracy, they naturally incur a cost-accuracy
    tradeoff. This requires us to strike a good balance between the resource cost
    and inference accuracy when tuning the video frame rate and resolution. Toward
    the above goal, Chameleon [104] adjusts the knobs for each video analytic task
    by sharing the best top- k configuration between each task. In Chameleon, the
    video tasks are grouped according to the spatial correlation, and then, the leader
    of the group will search for the best top- k configurations and share them with
    the followers. DeepDecision [112] formulates the knob-tunning problem as a multiple-choice
    multiple-constraint knapsack program and solves it with an improved brute-force
    search method. It is also worth noting that, in the computer architecture community,
    hardware acceleration for efficient DNN inference has been a very hot topic and
    gathered extensive research efforts. Interested readers are encouraged to refer
    to the recent monograph [114] for more comprehensive discussions about recent
    advancements on hardware acceleration for DNN processing. D. Summary of Existing
    Systems and Frameworks To showcase the application of the above enabling techniques
    for EI model inference, the relevant systems and frameworks are summarized in
    Table 4, including the perspectives of target applications, architecture and EI
    level, optimization objectives and adopted techniques, as well as effectiveness.
    Table 4 Overview of Systems and Frameworks on EI Model Inference Clearly, the
    existing systems and frameworks have adopted different subsets of enabling techniques
    tailored to specific EI applications and requirements. To maximize the overall
    performance of a generic EI system, comprehensive enabling techniques and various
    optimization methods should work in a cooperative manner to provide rich design
    flexibility. Nevertheless, we would face a high-dimensional configuration problem
    that is required to determine a large number of performance-critical configuration
    parameters in real time. Taking video analytics, for example, the high-dimensional
    configuration parameters can include video frame rate, resolution, model selection,
    and model early exit. Due to the combinatorial nature, the high-dimensional configuration
    problem involves a huge search space of parameters and is very challenging to
    tackle. SECTION VI. Future Research Directions Based on the comprehensive discussions
    above on existing efforts, we now articulate the key open challenges and future
    research directions for EI. A. Programming and Software Platforms Currently, many
    companies around the world focus on the AI cloud computing service provisioning.
    Some leading companies are also starting to provide programming/software platforms
    to deliver edge computing services, such as Amazon’s Greengrass, Microsoft’s Azure
    IoT Edge, and Google’s Cloud IoT Edge. Nevertheless, currently, most of these
    platforms mainly serve as relays for connecting to the powerful cloud data centers.
    As more and more AI-driven computation-intensive mobile and IoT applications are
    emerging, EI as a service (EIaaS) can become a pervasive paradigm and EI platforms
    with powerful edge AI functionalities will be developed and deployed. This is
    substantially different from ML as a service (MLaaS) provided by public clouds.
    Essentially, MLaaS belongs to cloud intelligence and it focuses on selecting the
    proper server configuration and ML framework to train model in the cloud in a
    cost-efficient manner. While in a sharp contrast, EIaaS concerns more about how
    to perform model training and inference in resource-constrained and privacy-sensitive
    edge computing environments. To fully realize the potential of EI services, there
    are several key challenges to overcome. First, the EI platforms should be heterogeneity-compatible.
    In the future, there are many dispersive EI service providers/vendors, and the
    common open standard should be set such that users can enjoy seamless and smooth
    services across heterogeneous EI platforms anywhere and anytime. Second, there
    are many AI programming frameworks available (e.g., Tensorflow, Torch, and Caffe).
    In the future, the portability of the edge AI models trained by different programming
    frameworks across heterogeneously distributed edge nodes should be supported.
    Third, there are many programming frameworks designed specifically for edge devices
    (e.g., TensorFlow Lite, Caffe2, CoreML, and MXNet); however, empirical measurements
    [115] show that there is no single winner that can outperform other frameworks
    in all metrics. A framework that performs efficiently on more metrics can be expected
    in the future. Last but not least, lightweight virtualization and computing techniques
    such as container and function computing should be further explored to enable
    efficient EI service placement and migration over resource-constrained edge environments.
    B. Resource-Friendly Edge AI Model Design Many existing AI models such as CNN
    and LSTM were originally designed for applications such as computer vision and
    natural language processing. Most of the deep learning-based AI models are highly
    resource-intensive, which means that powerful computing capability supported by
    abundant hardware resources (e.g., GPU, field-programmable gate array (FPGA),
    and TPU) is important to boost the performance of these AI models. Therefore,
    as mentioned above, there are many studies to exploit model compression techniques
    (e.g., weight pruning) to resize the AI models, making them more resource-friendly
    for edge deployment. Along with a different line, we can promote a resource-aware
    edge AI model design. Instead of utilizing the existing resource-intensive AI
    models, we can leverage the AutoML idea [116] and the neural architecture search
    (NAS) techniques [117] to devise resource-efficient edge AI models tailored to
    the hardware resource constraints of the underlying edge devices and servers.
    For example, methods such as RL, genetic algorithm, and BO can be adopted to efficiently
    search over the AI model design parameter space (i.e., AI model components and
    their connections) by taking into account the impact of hardware resource (e.g.,
    CPU and memory) constraints on the performance metrics such as execution latency
    and energy overhead. C. Computation-Aware Networking Techniques For EI, computation-intensive
    AI-based applications are typically run on the distributed edge computing environment.
    As a result, advanced networking solutions with computation awareness are highly
    desirable, such that the computation results and data can be efficiently shared
    across different edge nodes. For the future 5G networks, the ultrareliable low-latency
    communication (URLLC) has been defined for mission-critical application scenarios
    that demand low delay and high reliability. Therefore, it will be promising to
    integrate the 5G URLLC capability with edge computing to provide ultrareliable
    low-latency EI (URLL-EI) services. Also, advanced techniques such as software-defined
    network and network function virtualization will be adopted in 5G. These techniques
    will enable flexible control over the network resources for supporting on-demand
    interconnections across different edge nodes for computation-intensive AI applications.
    On the other hand, autonomous networking mechanism design is important to achieve
    efficient EI service provisioning under dynamic heterogeneous network coexistence
    (e.g., LTE/5G/WiFi/LoRa), allowing newly added edge nodes and devices to self-configure
    in the plug and play manner. Also, the computation-aware communication techniques
    are starting to draw attention, such as gradient coding [118] to mitigate straggler
    effect in distributed learning and over-the-air computation for DSGD [119], which
    can be useful for edge AI model training acceleration. D. Tradeoff Design With
    Various DNN Performance Metrics For an EI application with a specific mission,
    there is usually a series of DNN model candidates that are capable of finishing
    the task. However, it is difficult for software developers to choose an appropriate
    DNN model for the EI application because the standard performance indicators such
    as top- k accuracy or mean average precision fail to reflect the runtime performance
    of DNN model inference on edge devices. For instance, during the EI application
    deployment phase, beside accuracy, inference speed and resource usage are also
    critical metrics. We need to explore the tradeoffs between these metrics and identify
    the factors that affect them. For the object recognition application, Huang et
    al. [120] investigate the influence of the main factors, e.g., number of proposals,
    input image size, and the selection of feature extractor, on inference speed and
    accuracy. Based on their experiment results, a new combination of these factors
    is found to outperform the state-of-the-art method. Therefore, it is necessary
    to explore the tradeoffs between different metrics, helping in improving the efficiency
    of deploying EI application. E. Smart Service and Resource Management By the distributed
    nature of edge computing, edge devices and nodes that offer EI functionality are
    dispersive across diverse geolocations and regions. Different edge devices and
    nodes may run different AI models and deploy different specific AI tasks. Therefore,
    it is important to design efficient service discovery protocols such that users
    can identify and locate the relevant EI service providers to fulfill their need
    in a timely manner. Also, to fully exploit the dispersive resource across edge
    nodes and devices, the partition of complex edge AI models into small subtasks
    and efficiently offloading these tasks among the edge nodes and devices for collaborative
    executions are essential. Since for many EI application scenarios (e.g., smart
    cities), the service environments are of high dynamics and it is hard to accurately
    predict future events. As a result, it would require the outstanding capability
    of online edge resource orchestration and provisioning to continuously accommodate
    massive EI tasks. Real-time joint optimization of heterogeneous computation, communication,
    and cache resource allocations and the high-dimensional system parameter configuration
    (e.g., choosing the proper model training and inference techniques) tailored to
    diverse task demands are critical. To tackle the algorithm design complexity,
    an emerging research direction is to leverage the AI techniques such as DRL to
    adapt efficient resource allocation policy in a data-driven self-learning way.
    F. Security and Privacy Issues The open nature of edge computing imposes that
    the decentralized trust is required such that the EI services provided by different
    entities are trustworthy [121]. Thus, lightweight and distributed security mechanism
    designs are critical to ensure user authentication and access control, model and
    data integrity, and mutual platform verification for EI. Also, it is important
    to study novel secure routing schemes and trust network topologies for EI service
    delivery when considering the coexistence of trusted edge nodes with malicious
    ones. On the other hand, the end users and devices would generate a massive volume
    of data at the network edge, and these data can be privacy sensitive since they
    may contain user’s location data, health or activities records, or manufacturing
    information, among many others. Subject to the privacy protection requirement,
    e.g., EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), directly sharing the original
    data sets among multiple edge nodes can have a high risk of privacy leakage. Thus,
    federated learning can be a feasible paradigm for privacy-friendly distributed
    data training such that the original data sets are kept in their generated devices/nodes
    and the edge AI model parameters are shared. To further enhance the data privacy,
    more and more research efforts are devoted to using the tools of differential
    privacy and homomorphic encryption and secure multiparty computation for designing
    privacy-preserving AI model parameter-sharing schemes [122]. G. Incentive and
    Business Models EI ecosystem will be a grand open consortium that consists of
    EI service providers and users, which can include but not limited to: platform
    providers (e.g., Amazon), AI software providers (e.g., SenseTime), edge device
    providers (e.g., Hikvision), network operators (e.g., AT&T), data generators (e.g.,
    IoT and mobile device owners), and service consumers (i.e., EI users). The high-efficiency
    operation of EI services may require close collaboration and integration across
    different service providers, e.g., for implementing expanded resource sharing
    and smooth service handover. Thus, proper incentive mechanism and business model
    are essential to stimulate effective and efficient cooperation among all members
    of the EI ecosystem. Also, for EI service, a user can be a service consumer and,
    meanwhile, a data generator as well. In this case, a novel smart pricing scheme
    is needed to factorize user’s service consumption and the value of its data contribution.
    As a means for decentralized collaboration, blockchain with a smart contract may
    be integrated into EI service by running on decentralized edge servers. It is
    worthwhile to do research on how to smartly charge the price and properly distribute
    the revenue among the members in the EI ecosystem according to their proof of
    work. Also, designing resource-friendly lightweight blockchain consensus protocol
    for EI is highly desirable. SECTION VII. Conclusion Driving by flourishing of
    both AI and IoT, there is a stringent need to pushing the AI frontier from the
    cloud to the network edge. To fulfill this trend, edge computing has been widely
    recognized as a promising solution to support computation-intensive AI applications
    in resource-constrained environments. The nexus between edge computing and AI
    gives birth to the novel paradigm of EI. In this paper, we conducted a comprehensive
    survey of the recent research efforts on EI. Specifically, we first reviewed the
    background and motivation for AI running at the network edge. We then provided
    an overview of the overarching architectures, frameworks, and emerging key technologies
    for the deep learning model toward training and inference at the network edge.
    Finally, we discussed the open challenges and future research directions on EI.
    We hope this survey is able to elicit escalating attentions, stimulate fruitful
    discussions, and inspire further research ideas on EI. Authors Figures References

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Coimbatore, India SECTION I. Introduction
    Agriculture has the key part to play in strengthening the economic backbone of
    any developing country. It functions as the elementary source of income, food,
    employment and dispenses a substantial amount to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
    It is the earliest industry to supply the basic components to many other industries
    and lays the foundation for the Nation. With the scenario in India, agriculture
    devotes nearly 17 % to the total GDP and hands over employment to past 60 % of
    the populace. The cultivation of the Indian food grain production has incremented
    from 51 million tonnes in 1950-51 to a highest of about 250 million tonnes subsequent
    to Indian independence. The world population is near about 7.8 billion people
    now and it is growing at a pace of nearly 1.05 % per year. This is creating a
    hike in the agricultural demand. Gratifying incremented demands on agriculture
    by adopting the current farming techniques is expected to pave way to more critical
    striving for natural resources, incremented greenhouse effusion and additional
    problems like deforestation and land derogation. The regular classical techniques
    for the horticulture of the crops across the entire area drains the soil of a
    specific nutrient and thus, eventually the soil becomes infertile. Hand-operated
    maintenance of the agricultural field often becomes unwieldy and unavailable since
    the current date logistics illustrates that a very minor part of the total world
    populace wishes to pave their ways into the agricultural industries and this number
    continues to decrement at a very fast pace side by side. Keeping up bankroll data
    with perseverance paves way to errors, and the spreading of insecticides and pesticides
    on the entire field without any necessity affects the soil health negatively.
    Zone detection, Geo tagging and weather prediction is also not feasible with traditional
    farming. Adding to these, irrigating the entire field also results in drastic
    waste of water as not all parts of the field require the water at the same time.
    All these sums to the desideratum for a transformative and a developing agricultural
    archetype to maintain the growing surge for food and crop production appropriately
    thus, to ensure a sustainable development [1]. This is where IoT - based agriculture
    or smart agriculture [2] comes to its play. Smart agriculture technologies and
    precision agriculture are getting worldwide acclaim owing to their capability
    of standing up to such an incrementing demand and suffice food dispensing needs
    all over the world. One of the proclaimed smart farming cases in the world is
    that used in Chile where the use of distant and isolated sensors placed in the
    soil for measuring blueberry irrigation has decremented the volume of water used
    in the farming by nearly 70 % [3]. The worldwide smart agriculture barter is envisioned
    to reach 15.3billionbytheyear2025setsidebysideto 5 billion in the year 2016 [4].
    Smart farming chiefly is related to the work done on data which is gathered from
    various sources in the overall management of the operations taking place in the
    agricultural field. Smart farming deploys both IoT (hardware) and SaaS (software)
    to gather the related data and provide executable action plans, may it be prior
    or succeeding to the yield, to maintain all the operations on the farming lands.
    By making farming more associated and smarter, accuracy agriculture diminishes
    in general expenses and improve the quality and number of items, the sustainability
    of farming and the experience for the buyer. Increasing control over production
    leads to better cost management and waste reduction. The capacity to follow irregularities
    in crop development or animals’ wellbeing. Smart farming is important due to the
    grouping of the expanding global population, the increasing demand for advanced
    crop yield, the need to use natural resource efficiently, the growing use and
    sophistication of information and communication knowledge and the increasing need
    for the climate smart agriculture. The data is standardized, easily available,
    and comprises of enough information in every detail of the bankroll, and farm
    instrumentality that can be administered by any user present at any part of the
    world. The IoT concedes tangible objects to communicate with themselves, give
    out information to each other and sum up resolutions, thus helping to transform
    the elemental objects into intelligent ones. The IoT application has been devised
    for smart agriculture by deploying Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), such as irrigation
    sensor networks [5], prediction of frost events [6], precision soil agriculture
    [7], blind entity identification [8], smart farming [9] and precision agriculture
    [10] To devise a green IoT - based agricultural solution [11], there are some
    interests which are to be served adequately. Coming first, the specific sensors
    (for instance, pressure sensors, temperature sensors, etc.) vital for the IoT
    application are to be picked shrewdly. Next, the algorithms should be devised
    keeping in mind all the feasible probabilities vital for the best prediction and
    machine learning should be brought into application adequately. Coming next, the
    sensors are more liable to cripple in the farmland, so custom auditing of these
    are required. Next, the form of the wireless communication should be in accordance
    to the requirement of the sensors to be linked over a specific land area in the
    farmland. Next, comes the coronation of the IoT archetype by deploying the concepts
    of say, cloud computing. Lastly and chiefly, the security and privacy [12] of
    the system should be ascertained by authenticating the established system, assuring
    its concealment, candor and controlled admittance. This study tries to project
    an idea of smart agriculture implementation where the proposed work deploys the
    three sensors namely- 1. Hygrometer, 2. DHT-11, and 3. NFK sensor, to get the
    information concerning the moisture and nutrient content of the soil and this
    is then supplied to the Node MCU from where the data flows to a Google Firebase
    and then to a prediction module. In the prediction module, the gathered soil information
    is correlated with the appropriate requirements to cultivate a specific crop and
    then the decisions are taken so as to vary the environmental conditions to ensure
    the best cultivation of the crop and this entire information is now stored in
    the cloud from where it is broadcasted to the user interface through the Hypertext
    Transfer Protocol (HTTP protocol). SECTION II. Materials and Methods A. System
    modelling The proposed work surrounds around 100 acres of agricultural field.
    This area is reft into 10 chunks, each having a 10-acre land in them. Each of
    these chunks includes the assorted sensors, which would study the encompassing
    habitat and bring about suitable and immediate measures as needed for the best
    crop cultivation possible. Each chunk has four sensors. Firstly, the DHT-11 sensors
    measure the temperature and humidity of the environment. It invariably provides
    the data concerning the amount of voltage scope of 3.3 to 5.6 V. It is finely
    appropriate to low voltage micro controllers. Secondly, the acoustic sensors are
    very advantageous in making certain about the soil texture, that is, to analyse
    whether the soil specimen is fine or coarse. These sensors function by scaling
    the level of noise owing to the synergy of a working equipment with the particles
    of the soil and thus, would successfully measure the soil permeability. Coming
    next, the capacitive soil moisture sensors are dielectric sensors which calculates
    the soil moisture content. These deploy capacitance to calculate the encompassing
    medium’s permitivity. The sensor produces the frequency response of the capacitance
    of the soil owing to its soil moisture content, as the output. Last is the the
    electrochemical sensors which provides the real-time data related to the system’s
    composition. It couples an electrochemical transducer with the recognition element
    (a chemically selective layer) and is liable for calculating the pH level of the
    soil. All of these sensors would be installed across the fields. The data collected
    from these would be broadcasted to the gateway by employing the WiFi module (ESP
    8266). The NodeMCU can be described as a less expensive Open Source for the IoT
    projects. For the precise working of the ESP8266 WiFi chip, it is established
    on the grounds of a LUA scripting language. At the beginning, it included a hardware
    which was established on the grounds of the ESP-12 module and a firmware which
    worked on the ESP8266 WiFi - SOC from the Express of Systems. Now, to give assistance
    to the system, ESP32, 32-bit MCU was installed. It includes prototyping board
    designs and a firmware which are gradually Open Source. The firmware employed
    is established on eLUA project and is fabricated on the Expressif NON-OS SDK to
    back ESP8266. The firmware deploys assorted open source projects like luacjson
    and SPITES. On the other hand, the prototyping hardware used operations such as
    a Dual In Line Package (DIP) which consolidates the small surface - mounted board
    comprising of antenna and MCU with the controller. The water pumps established
    over the specific agricultural land area which are linked to the motor drivers
    would accomplish the accords broadcasted through the ESP 8266. The broadcasting
    of data is accomplished by adopting the LORA (Long Range) wireless technology
    of transmission. The advantage of using this technology is that it can bring about
    long-distance communication (approx. 100Km) held down by low power expenditure.
    The communication radius in open area can catch up to 5Km or more. It is owing
    to the fact that broadcast rates and communication distance of these are proportional
    to each other. In each of the terminal nodes, the master microcontroller of the
    NodeMCU is liable to process and transform the data gathered by the sensors and
    the data regarding the time and position in the GPS module. The process of control
    of ESP 8266 involves four steps. To start with, it is required to power up the
    terminal node and thus, the ESP 8266 initializes and delineates the pins. coming
    next, the LoRa module initializes and fixes the dispatching frequency and power.
    After a itemized deferred time is attained, data acquisition begins. Now, the
    data packet is dispatched through the LoRa module to the sink node. There it has
    ten terminal nodes which will communicate with the centrally located sink node.
    The LoRa sink node module chiefly consists of chief node MCU control platforms.
    This will in turn be linked to GPRS wireless communication module, power module
    and the LoRa wireless communication module. Firstly, the LoRa module obtains the
    data from the terminal node and processes it and this is controlled by the NodeMCU.
    Now, the GPRS wireless communication module dispatches the gathered data of the
    surroundings, knowledge about the location, and time stamps altogether to the
    cloud platform’s server on the controlled action of the NodeMCU on it yet again.
    The control process of the NodeMCU in the sink node involves three steps. Firstly,
    the sink node should be powered up and then, it should initialize the hardware
    like LoRa wireless communication modules and NodeMCU modules. Now, the data is
    received from the terminal node and these are then integrated. Finally, all the
    data is dispatched through the GPRS to the remote monitoring platform’s server.
    Fig 1: Communication protocol for transmission and receiving of data. Show All
    B. Software Modelling The data gathered from the farming lands is dispatched to
    a server which uses the Hypertext Transfer Protocol. The Hypertext Transfer Protocol
    is the elemental protocol adopted by the World Wide Web. This protocol delineates
    the way of the formatting and transmitting of the messages and also how the web
    servers and browsers respond in action to the diversified directives. After this,
    the whole project is worked upon the Google Cloud Console, a cloud platform. The
    data is imbibed from the server to a Google Cloud Console product, Cloud pub/sub.
    Pub/sub is an asynchronous messaging service that decouples services that processes
    events from services that generates events. Pub/sub brings forward reliable message
    store and message dispatch on real-time basis with high availability and constant
    accomplishment in a long-range rate. Pub/sub servers work in every Google Cloud
    area around the globe. A pub/sub subscription can be composed to dispatch every
    message like an HTTP POST appeals to webhook, a push endpoint URL. In routine,
    the push endpoint must be publicly reachable HTTPS server, handing out an authentic
    SSL certificate endorsed by a certificate authority and which is able to be routed
    by Domain Name System (DNS). Pub/sub will push messages to the subscription from
    every single area where messages are published on the subscription’s subject matter.
    Adding to these, push subscriptions can be composed to supply an authorization
    header to favour the endpoints to corroborate the demands. The affairs are published
    as pub/sub messages which will afterwards be chose after gushing data into Big
    Query by the Cloud Function. Google Cloud Functions is an affair-directed computing
    service which does not involve any server and is present within Google Cloud Platform.
    The developers may use it to devise and realize programmatic functions within
    Google’s public cloud notwithstanding the planning of the elemental cloud framework
    like the server and depot. Big Query is a less expensive, highly ascendable cloud
    data repository without any server, devised to aid us in making intellectual resolutions
    promptly so that it can revamp our venture with comfort. In this paper, to gush
    matter into Big Query, it is required to be in possession of a cloud Storage bucket
    and a target table in Big Query. The chief objective of this bucket is to hoard
    JSON files that are gushed into Big Query, for a brief time. Coming next, it is
    required to set up the content terminal for our files and this would be fulfilled
    by the Big Query Table. Big Query makes us able to determine the schema of the
    table when a new table is created or when data is pushed into the table. As the
    source and destination sinks are devised, it is now required to devise the Cloud
    Function to gush data into Big Query from Cloud Storage. The gushing function
    observes for fresh files added to the bucket and then prompts a process which
    does the following steps. It construes and corroborates the file and finds out
    for corollaries. Fig 2: Representation of the software model. Show All Later it
    injects the file’s subject matter into Big Query and records the ingestion condition
    in Firebase and Logging. Now, it publishes a message to an error or success topic
    in Pub/Sub. The data is downloaded for machine learning insights and reuploaded
    into Big Query. Whilst data is gushed into Big Query it is crucial to comprehend
    the proceedings with every file ingestion. For example, let us consider it will
    have files that were inadequately imported. In such an event, it is required to
    check out the primary source of the problem and secure it to prevent produce corrupted
    data and inaccurate reports at the closure of our pipeline. The gushing function,
    set up in the preceding division, stores the file ingestion status in Firebase
    documents so that it will query the current flaws to troubleshoot any issues.
    Fig 3: Representation of Hardware Model. Show All The firebase can be defined
    as an ascendable database management system along with multipurpose facilities
    to develop mobile, web server development. When the Firebase project is linked
    to Big Query, it will be picked to export Google Analytics for Firebase (including
    some A/B Testing and Dynamic Links data), Crashlytics, Predictions, Cloud Messaging
    and/or Performance Monitoring data to corresponding Big Query datasets on a routine
    basis. The succeeding Figures (2) and (3) illustrates the decision making block
    of the program for the future application on the site of the fields. SECTION III.
    Result and Discussions The proposed work, as presented by us here, gathers the
    related essential data from the field sensors and the data in turn, is processed
    and the outcomes are envisaged in the mode of graphs at the user end to analyze
    and implement effectively the measures as needed for a healthy crop cultivation.
    These visions are provided by running a machine learning program in python. In
    the python program, the first step is to import machine learning libraries like
    NumPy, Matplotlib.pyplot, Pandas and scikit learn. NumPy have a large number of
    mathematical functions used on big arrays of data and matrices. Pandas, on the
    other hand offer operations and Data Structures for maintaining time series and
    numerical tables. The executing part of the program requires scikit learn which
    have functions classification, clustering algorithms and regressions including
    support vector apparatus. At the end matplotlib is as plotting tool in the language.
    After including the libraries, the data which was collected on field and brought
    down to the cloud is imported to the program. The data should be split between
    a dependent variable and independent variable for a single variate linear regression
    model. The variable, that is month, should be encoded with integer because python
    programming does not understand string. It is done by importing label encoder
    imported form scikit learn library. Then, the dataset is divided into the training
    (60 percent) and test (40 percent) set. With the function train test split included
    from sklearn library; the set is trained by using simple linear regression model
    which is also an embedded function of scikit learn. Now it will pass an object
    to the newly created regression model using the regressor.fit function and predict
    the results. The results are then plot using the pyplot.plot function from matplotlib
    library. The results are then provided to the end user who can have an insight
    about what can happen next. The data, thus gathered, is pushed into Big Query
    for using google cloud console’s google firebase for better representation of
    data. The figures for moisture content of the soil of every 10 acres agricultural
    area in each of the seasons and this data is gathered through the capacitive soil
    sensor. A 555 based circuit is used to appraise the capacitance of these sensors.
    This circuit produces a voltage which is equal or proportional to the capacitance
    of the capacitor located inside the soil. The voltage, thus created, is computed
    by using an analog to digital converter which in turn generates a numeric value
    that can construe as the value of the soil moisture content. The graphs henceforth,
    plotted with the help of this retrieved data, are studied, monitored and thus
    the pumps, established over every 10 acres agricultural field area, are turned
    on when the moisture content in a specific agricultural field goes down below
    the threshold level. The data particularly for soil permeability has been collected
    using the acoustic sensors which establishes over every 10 acres of agricultural
    field area. These sensors deploy the method of compelling a particular volume
    of air into the soil at a specific depth up to which it is able to work and thus
    appraises the pressure. The data produced is now, correlated to the properties
    of soil like its structure and soil compaction. This is now analyzed and it helps
    to make the authoritative person aware of the requirement of the soil to be ploughed
    so as to ensure proper aeration. Fig 4: Temperature prediction of the next 25
    weeks. Show All The figures depicted above is the prediction of temperature of
    the location where the farming fields are present. These data are gathered from
    the DHT-11 sensors which measures the relative humidity by appraising the electrical
    resistance between two of the electrodes. The shift in the value of resistance
    between the electrodes is directly analogous to the relative humidity existing
    in the atmosphere. The data appraised is now, analysed and graphs are plotted
    using programming in the language python. The graphs These graphs are finally
    envisaged in the user - end application. Fig 5: Rainfall prediction in next 25
    weeks. Show All The data shown above predicts the essential rainfall for the crops.
    These graphs will provide the necessary data for the user when to start the process
    of cultivation i.e. in this case ploughing. According to the data the user should
    conserve the water after the tenth week for the proper growth of crops and preventing
    the drying up of lands. SECTION IV. Conclusion This paper comes up with the implementation
    of smart soil conditions monitoring system with the aid of cloud computing and
    the Internet of Things. This smart system gathers data like the soil texture,
    temperature, humidity, permeability soil, pH level of soil, and other such analogous
    quantities. These data are now, sent to a cloud where it gets stored and are further
    processed and analysed by adopting some specific algorithms, constituting the
    prediction module. Thus, gradually this system assists the farmers to achieve
    a productive crop harvest. Our proposed system aids with the routine check of
    the soil texture and fertility and thus, ensures the farmers to take the apt measures
    needed for the bountiful and healthy crop cultivation. The algorithms are first
    evaluated where the comparisons between the real-time data of the available soil
    texture gathered by the various sensors in the field and the factual soil texture
    and other requirements which favour the cultivation of a specific crop, are done.
    The graphs so plotted according to the retrieved data are visualized in this process.
    Now, proportionately, according to the analyzations, the subsequent measures like
    ploughing and irrigation are accomplished. This system also helps to curtail the
    wasteful water use in the irrigation process in the fields. The agricultural activities
    and the crop production can be effortlessly supervised and controlled by any user
    sitting at any corner of the world. The virtual store used here, i.e the Google
    Cloud Console, aids to prevent data loss and does not involve any complexities
    in offline data storage maintenance. Thus, the system described in this paper
    is highly efficient, user-friendly and reliable. For the future work of this paper,
    incorporation of image processing and computer vision can be done. This would
    help the farmers to detect any disease by studying the condition of the leaves,
    the yield and thus, help them to take on-time decisions for the spraying of suitable
    amount of pesticides to the crops and other such measures. Adding to these, other
    microcontrollers can be used to reinforce the data processing unit and to aid
    them, precisely and accurately, in analysing problems which come up at the field
    during crop cultivation. Furthermore, the management and protection of the colossal
    data, gathered using the various sensors, against cybersecurity threats should
    be ensured properly. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics More

    This article presents an approach to provide strong assurance of the secure execution
    of distributed event-driven applications on shared infrastructures, while relying
    on a small Trusted Computing Base. We build upon and extend security primitives
    provided by Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to guarantee authenticity and
    integrity properties of applications, and to secure control of input and output
    devices. More specifically, we guarantee that if an output is produced by the
    application, it was allowed to be produced by the application’s source code based
    on an authentic trace of inputs. We present an integrated open-source framework
    to develop, deploy, and use such applications across heterogeneous TEEs. Beyond
    authenticity and integrity, our framework optionally provides confidentiality
    and a notion of availability, and facilitates software development at a high level
    of abstraction over the platform-specific TEE layer. We support event-driven programming
    to develop distributed enclave applications in Rust and C for heterogeneous TEE,
    including Intel SGX, ARM TrustZone, and Sancus. In this article we discuss the
    workings of our approach, the extensions we made to the Sancus processor, and
    the integration of our development model with commercial TEEs. Our evaluation
    of security and performance aspects show that TEEs, together with our programming
    model, form a basis for powerful security architectures for dependable systems
    in domains such as Industrial Control Systems and the Internet of Things, illustrating
    our framework’s unique suitability for a broad range of use cases which combine
    cloud processing, mobile and edge devices, and lightweight sensing and actuation.
    Skip 1INTRODUCTION Section 1 INTRODUCTION Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)
    allow an application to execute in a hardware-protected environment, often called
    enclave. Enclaves are isolated and protected from the rest of the system, ensuring
    strong confidentiality and integrity guarantees. Cryptographic primitives and
    credential management, with keys that are unique per enclave and that can only
    be used by that enclave, enable secure communication and remote attestation; the
    latter is a mechanism to obtain cryptographic proof that an application is running
    under enclave protection on a specific processor. Several Trusted Execution Environments
    (TEEs) are available in industry and research. Open-source TEEs include Sancus
    and Keystone; proprietary options are, e.g., Software Guard Extensions (SGX) for
    Intel processors, Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV) for AMD, TrustZone for
    ARM, and others [41]. Developing applications that execute on heterogeneous TEEs
    is difficult, in particular for scenarios that combine Internet-of-Things, Edge,
    and cloud hardware: each TEE requires a platform-specific software implementation,
    comes with different approaches to key management and attestation, a different
    Trusted Computing Base (TCB) footprint, and provides different hardware features
    and security guarantees. The development of a distributed application composed
    of multiple modules running on heterogeneous hardware is non-trivial by itself,
    but becomes an even bigger challenge when the application has stringent security
    requirements that demand the use of TEE architectures. A developer needs to make
    choices as to which security features are required for which components, adapt
    the code of each component to multiple specific platforms, arrange for different
    deployment and attestation strategies, and implement secure interaction between
    the components. Open-source projects such as Open Enclave SDK and Google Asylo
    aim at bridging the development gap between different TEEs. However, software
    engineers still need to account for the communication between different modules,
    which has to be properly secured with cryptographic operations for data encryption
    and authentication. In particular, the responsibility for deploying the distributed
    application, loading and attesting each enclave, establishing session keys, and
    securing connections between distributed components, is still left to the application
    developer and operator. Overall, ensuring strong security guarantees in distributed
    scenarios poses a challenge to the adoption of TEE technology. This article studies
    the problem of securely executing distributed applications on such a shared, heterogeneous
    TEE-infrastructure, while relying on a small run-time Trusted Computing Base (TCB).
    We want to provide the owner of such an application with strong assurance that
    their application is executing securely. We focus on (1) authenticity and integrity
    properties of (2) event-driven distributed applications. For this selection of
    security property and class of applications, we specify the exact security guarantees
    offered by our approach. We believe our approach to be valuable for any kind of
    distributed application (event-driven or not). In particular, our prototype supports
    arbitrary C and Rust code. We distinguish physical events, such as sensor inputs
    or actuation, from logical events that are generated and consumed by application
    components. Roughly speaking, our notion of authentic execution is the following:
    if the application produces a physical output event (e.g., turns on an LED), then
    there must have happened a sequence of physical input events such that that sequence,
    when processed by the application (as specified in the high-level source code),
    produces that output event. This notion of security is roughly equivalent to the
    concept of robust safety in later literature [2]. Our approach has been experimented
    with in previous work, where we secure smart distributed applications in the context
    of smart metering infrastructures [47], automotive computing [65], and precision
    agriculture [59], which we generalize and partly formalize under the name “authentic
    execution” in [51], and use as a training and tutorial scenario to explain attestation
    and secure communication with heterogeneous TEEs [48]. The main contributions
    of this article are — We reflect on the design and implementation of an approach
    for authentic execution of event-driven programs on heterogeneous distributed
    systems, under the assumption that the execution infrastructure offers specific
    security primitives – standard enclaves [61] plus support for secure I/O [52]
    (Section 3); we comprehensively discuss corner cases and hurdles regarding the

    , a formalization and proof sketch of our security guarantees is also available
    there. Skip 2Running Example, Infrastructure & Objectives Section 2 Running Example,
    Infrastructure & Objectives As a running example we discuss an automated irrigation
    system, as illustrated in Figure 1, which involves a series of light-weight sensors
    and actuators in the field that, e.g., monitor soil moisture and crop growth,
    and control water supply. The system can be connected to edge infrastructure or
    cloud services for centralized configuration and maintenance, to integrate reporting
    and billing, and to minimize water consumption based on weather predictions. Naturally,
    smart farming systems are security critical since malicious interactions can potentially
    lead to huge costs and may destroy a crop; they also feature a high level of dynamicity
    where equipment needs to be reconfigured for specific sensing and actuation tasks
    that depend on the type of crop [57] and, e.g., sustainability objectives [62],
    and demand a high level of dependability where events must be guaranteed to be
    processed in a timely manner. Fig. 1. Fig. 1. A smart irrigation system as an
    example for distributed application networks we can support. Light-weight sensing
    and actuation nodes are deployed in a field. Application AppA controls irrigation
    units (through driver Drv2) and water supply (Drv3), based on soil moisture (obtained
    through Drv1). Application AppB provides similar functionality but has access
    to additional data sources, e.g., aerial surveillance and data aggregation on
    central infrastructure. All application components execute in enclaves (colored)
    and the actual composition and configuration of components can change dynamically.
    Directed data flows through untrusted networks (colored arrows) are at least authenticated
    and integrity protected; attestation precedes the establishment of all data flows,
    and mutual authentication is established between enclaves. All other software
    in the scenario is untrusted regarding our security properties, which leads to
    a very small run-time application TCB. Guaranteeing availability properties may
    require a different compartmentalization strategy. The concept is also applicable
    across, e.g., the different control units within a car or in an autonomous robot.
    Figure 2 (source code in Figure 3) zooms in on the light-weight in-field sensing
    and actuation on the left side in Figure 1 and details application modules and
    event flows in an agricultural sensor network with two soil moisture sensors.
    The infrastructure can be reused for multiple applications which can be provided
    by different stakeholders. Applications include visualizing soil moisture, targeted
    irrigation, or detection of flooding or leakage. We show two of these applications:
    one ( A Flo ) that detects flooding or leakage and disconnects the water supply
    in case of emergency, and another ( A Agg ) that aggregates and displays data
    on soil moisture. Fig. 2. Fig. 2. Our running example with two applications, A
    Agg (blue) and A Flo (red). Hardware ( N ∗ and D ∗ ) is trusted; the OS and the
    network are untrusted. E.g., the A Flo deployer creates the three red Software
    Modules (SMs) (cf. Figure 3(a)) with a trusted compiler, attests the shared sensor-,
    clock-, and display drivers and sets-up connections between the SMs. Remote attestation
    assures authentic execution of A Agg and A Flo . Fig. 3. Fig. 3. Pseudo-code of
    the applications from Figure 2. in a Python-like syntax. Enclaved application
    components are declared using the module keyword and span until the next module
    or the end of the file. The on statement starts an event handler which can connect
    to an output of another application component, or to a physical I/O channel. Outputs
    are implicitly declared when invoked through a function call-like syntax. 2.1
    The Shared Infrastructure The infrastructure is a collection of nodes ( N i ),
    where each node consists of a processor, memory, and a number of I/O devices (
    D i ). Multiple mutually distrusting stakeholders share the infrastructure to
    execute distributed applications ( A i ). For simplicity, we assume processors
    are simple microprocessors, such as the OpenMSP430 used in our prototype, to explain
    the underlying concepts and security guarantees of our approach. As we detail
    in Section 4 and thereafter, our implementation does support the commercial TEEs
    TrustZone and Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX), and we evaluate our approach
    on an integrated scenario that involves these TEEs. An I/O device interfaces the
    processor with the physical world and facilitates sensing physical quantities
    (e.g., the state of a switch), influencing physical quantities (e.g., an LED),
    and notifying the processor of state change (e.g., a key being pressed) by issuing
    an interrupt. In our running example, there are 5 nodes. Two of these (and) are
    each attached to two input devices (a clock D Ti and a soil moisture sensor D
    Si ), and are installed in a field, e.g., along a row of crops. Two other nodes
    (and) are connected to the actuator and display devices ( D A , D D ) to control
    the water supply and show application output. One node ( N Agg ) is not connected
    to any I/O device but performs general-purpose computations, e.g., aggregate data
    from sensor nodes. 2.2 Modules & Applications We use an event-driven application
    model and modules ( M i ) contain input- and output channels. Upon reception of
    an event on an input channel, the corresponding event handler is executed atomically
    and new events on the module’s output channels may be produced. An application,
    then, is a collection of modules together with a deployment descriptor. This descriptor
    specifies on which nodes the modules should be installed as well as how the modules’
    channels should be connected. Channels can be connected in two ways. First, one
    module’s output channel can be connected to another’s input channel, behaving
    like a buffered queue of events. Second, the infrastructure can provide a number
    of physical I/O channels which can be connected to a module’s I/O channels. The
    infrastructure must ensure that events on such channels correspond to physical
    events: An event received on a physical input could correspond to a button press
    or, similarly, an event produced on a physical output could turn on an LED. An
    important contribution of this article is a design to securely connect modules
    to physical I/O channels (Sections 3.4 and 4.1.5). In our example applications
    (Figure 2), A Flo consists of three modules: two ( M FloS1 and M FloS2 ) are deployed
    in a field and detect excess moisture (flooding or leakage) and one ( M FloA )
    actuates a central tap to disconnect water supply if needed. The two in-field
    modules have two inputs that are connected to input devices provided by the infrastructure:
    one that produces events for changes in soil moisture ( D Si ) and another that
    sends periodical timer events ( D Ti ). As the source code (Figure 3(a)) shows,
    these modules first wait for changes in critical changes in soil moisture, then
    wait for a maximum number of timer events, and finally produce an output event
    to indicate an emergency. These output events are connected to the inputs of M
    FloA which in turn produces output events and sends them to the output actuator
    D A . A second application A Agg shares access to the sensor drivers with A Flo
    to obtain sensor readings that are then aggregated and displayed. 2.3 Attacker
    Model We consider powerful attackers that can manipulate all the software on the
    nodes. Attackers can deploy their own applications on the infrastructure, but
    they can also tamper with the OS. Attackers can also control the communication
    network that nodes use to communicate with each other. Attackers can sniff the
    network, modify traffic, or mount man-in-the-middle attacks. With respect to the
    cryptographic capabilities of the attacker, we follow the Dolev-Yao model [19].
    Attacks against the hardware are out of scope. We assume the attacker to not have
    physical access to the nodes, neither can they physically tamper with I/O devices.
    We also do not consider side-channel attacks against our implementation. Physical
    protection and side-channel resistance are important but orthogonal and complementary
    to the protection offered by our approach. 2.4 Security Objective The deployer
    uses his own (trusted) computing infrastructure to compile the application A,
    to deploy the modules to the nodes in the shared infrastructure, and to configure
    connections between modules, and between modules and physical I/O channels. At
    run-time, a sequence of physical input events will happen, and the deployer can
    observe the sequence of physical output events that return. We say that this sequence
    of outputs is authentic for an application A if it is allowed by A’s modules and
    deployment descriptor in response to the actual trace of input events: the source
    code of A explains the physical outputs on the basis of actual physical inputs
    that have happened. Section 3.5 will detail this sequence of physical input, processing,
    and lastly physical output further. Our objective is to design a deployment algorithm
    such that the deployer can easily certify the authenticity of sequences. If the
    correctness of the deployment is verified, then our approach guarantees that any
    subsequent trace of output events observed by the deployer will be authentic.
    This security notion rules out a wide range of attacks, including attacks where
    event transmissions on the network are spoofed or reordered, and attacks where
    malicious software tampers with the execution of modules. Other relevant attacks
    are not covered by this security objective. We will explain more nuances regarding
    deployment in Section 3.5. As discussed earlier, there are no general availability
    guarantees – e.g., the attacker can suppress network communication. However, TEE
    extensions such as [4] and the use of real-time operating systems can provide
    notions of availability that are relevant to maintain system safety in, e.g.,
    autonomous control systems. There are also no strong confidentiality guarantees:
    Although this is not the focus of our design, our implementation does provide
    substantial protection of the confidentiality of application state as well as
    event payloads. Yet, the attacker may still observe the occurrence and timing
    of events in the system, and specifically on the sensing-and-actuation side of
    our systems, this information may very well reveal the state of the system. While
    it is technically possible to close these side channels, e.g., with artificially
    generated noise, this is infeasible for our light-weight TEEs and under constrained
    energy consumption (cf. Section 6.1 for details). Many systems similar to our
    running example from Figure 1 exist, e.g., in the context of the Internet of Things,
    smart building, supply chain management, or intelligent transport systems. These
    may come with different requirements regarding security and privacy, potentially
    beyond the baseline guarantees of our framework. In Section 5.1 we look specifically
    at a smart-home scenario and discuss performance characteristics and security
    guarantees (cf. Section 6). Skip 3AUTHENTIC EXECUTION OF DISTRIBUTED APPLICATIONS
    Section 3 AUTHENTIC EXECUTION OF DISTRIBUTED APPLICATIONS We outline our requirements
    for the infrastructure wrt. security features, and show how these features are
    used effectively to accomplish our security goals. 3.1 Underlying Architecture:
    TEEs Given the shared nature of the infrastructure assumed in our system model,
    we require the ability to isolate source modules from other code running on a
    node. Since an important non-functional goal is to minimize the TCB, relying on
    a classical omnipotent kernel to provide isolation is ruled out. Therefore, we
    assume the underlying architecture is a TEE [61]. While details vary between TEEs,
    isolation of software modules is understood as follows: A module must be able
    to specify memory locations containing data that are accessible by the module’s
    code only (data isolation). The code of a module must be immutable and a module
    must specify a number of entry points through which its code can be executed (code
    isolation). For simplicity, we further assume that both a module’s code and data
    are located in contiguous memory areas called, respectively, its code section
    and its data section. We expect TEEs to implement a W⊕X policy so as to prevent
    code modification and code generation at runtime. We also expect the availability
    of a compiler that correctly translates Software Modules (SMs) to the underlying
    architecture. The input to this compiler is as follows: (1) a list of entry point
    functions; (2) a list of non-entry functions; (3) a list of variables that should
    be allocated in the isolated data section; and (4) a list of constants that should
    be allocated in the isolated code section. The output of the compiler should be
    an SM suitable for isolation on the underlying architecture. Besides isolation,
    we expect the TEE to provide a way to attest the correct isolation of an SM. Attestation
    provides proof that an SM with a certain identity has been isolated on the node,
    where the identity of an SM, usually based on a measurement of the deployed binary
    code, should give the deployer assurance that this SM will behave as the corresponding
    source code module. After enabling isolation, the TEE should be capable of establishing
    a confidential, integrity protected, and authenticated communication channel between
    an SM and its deployer. Although the details of how this works may differ from
    one TEE to another, for simplicity, we assume the TEE establishes a shared secret
    between an SM and its deployer and provides an authenticated encryption primitive.
    We refer to this shared secret as the module key. The authentication property
    of the communication channel refers to an SM’s identity and hence to attestation.
    Thus, the TEE ensures that if a deployer receives a message created with a module
    key, it can only have been created by the corresponding, correctly isolated, SM.
    3.2 Mapping source modules to SMs To map a source module to an SM, we use the
    following procedure. First, each of the source module’s inputs and outputs is
    assigned a unique I/O identifier, and each of the connections between source modules
    is assigned a unique connection identifier. The format of these identifiers is
    unimportant, provided that they uniquely specify a particular input/output or
    a particular connection, respectively. By having a clear distinction between I/O
    identifiers and connection identifiers, many-to-many connections are supported,
    which means that: (1) a source module’s output can be connected to multiple inputs
    of other source modules (e.g., a keyboard that sends key press events to both
    a key-logger and an LCD screen), and (2) a source module’s input can be reached
    by multiple outputs of other source modules (e.g., a key-logger that records key
    presses of two different keyboards). Second, a table (ConnectionTable) is added
    to the SM’s variables that maps connection identifiers to a Connection data structure,
    such that every connection has one entry associated with it. These entries will
    be initialized to all zeros by the underlying architecture, which is interpreted
    as an unestablished connection. For establishing a connection, an entry point
    is generated (SetKey). This entry point takes a connection identifier, an I/O
    identifier, and a key – encrypted using the module key – as input and updates
    the corresponding mapping in ConnectionTable (Figure 4). Since every connection
    needs to be protected from reordering and replay attacks, the Connection structure
    also includes a nonce. Fig. 4. Fig. 4. Pseudocode of the SetKey entry point. Note
    that Decrypt uses the module key to decrypt the payload and throws an exception
    if the operation failed (i.e., the payload’s MAC is incorrect). Third, all the
    module’s event handlers are marked as non-entry functions. A callback table (CbTable)
    is added to the SM’s constants, mapping input identifiers to the corresponding
    event handlers. This table is used by the entry point HandleInput, which is called
    when an event is delivered to the SM. HandleInput takes two arguments: a plain-text
    connection identifier and an encrypted payload. If ConnectionTable has a connection
    for the given identifier, its key is used to decrypt the payload (using the expected
    nonce as associated data), which is then passed to the callback function stored
    in CbTable, retrieved using the I/O identifier stored in the Connection structure.
    If any of these operations fails, the event is ignored (Figure 5). From a programmer’s
    perspective, an input callback will only be called for events generated by entities
    with access to valid connection keys. Fig. 5. Fig. 5. Pseudocode of the HandleInput
    entry point. Erroneous accesses to the tables as well as errors during Decrypt
    cause exceptions. Thus, these events, as well as those for which no input key
    has been set, are ignored. Decrypt takes a key and the expected associated data
    as arguments. Fourth, each call to an output is replaced by a call to a non-entry
    wrapper function HandleOutput. This function takes a connection identifier and
    a payload, encrypts the payload together with the current nonce using the corresponding
    connection key, then publishes the encrypted event (via HandleLocalEvent, cf.
    3.3.2). If the output is unconnected, the output event is dropped (Figure 6).
    Fig. 6. Fig. 6. Pseudocode of the generated output wrapper. Since the compiler
    generates calls to this function that cannot be called from outside the module,
    the connection identifier is always valid and no error checking is necessary.
    Fifth, an entry point Attest is generated, which will be called by the deployer
    to attest the SM. This function takes a challenge as input and returns an attestation
    evidence as response. The attestation procedure and the content of the attestation
    evidence may vary from one TEE technology to the other; nonetheless, the input
    challenge is typically used as a freshness parameter to prevent replay attacks.
    On some TEEs, the attestation process also includes the generation of a shared
    secret between the SM and the deployer, which will be used as the module key (Figure
    7). Fig. 7. Fig. 7. Pseudocode of the Attest entry point. Since the attestation
    of an SM is TEE-specific, we use a high-level function GenAttestationEvidence
    to retrieve the attestation evidence. The actual implementation of this function
    depends on the TEE used. To conclude, the following SM definition is given as
    input to the TEE compiler: (1) SetKey, Attest, and HandleInput as entry points;
    (2) input event handlers and HandleOutput as non-entry functions; (3) ConnectionTable
    as a global variable; and (4) CbTable as a constant. Figure 8 shows the compiled
    memory layout of one of the example modules. Fig. 8. Fig. 8. Memory layout of
    the compiled version of module M FloS1 in application A Flo (Figure 3(a)). The
    code- and data sections are shaded in yellow and blue, respectively. The numbers
    on the left labels correspond to the compiler inputs, while the right labels indicate
    whether parts are implicitly generated by the compiler or correspond to source
    code. 3.3 Untrusted Software on the Nodes To support the deployment of modules
    and the exchange of events between modules, untrusted (and unprotected) software
    components need to be installed on each node, as outlined below. 3.3.1 Module
    Loader. The module loader is an untrusted software component running on every
    node. The module loader provides services for external entities to interact with
    modules on a node. To this end, the module loader listens for two types of remote
    requests: LoadModule and CallEntry. LoadModule takes a compiled SM as input, loads
    it into the TEE, and returns the module’s unique identifier together with all
    information necessary for attestation and module key establishment. What exactly
    this information is and how the attestation and key establishment are performed
    is specific to the used TEE. CallEntry takes an SM’s identifier, the identifier
    of an entry point, and potentially some arguments and calls the entry point with
    the given arguments. 3.3.2 Event Manager. The event manager is another untrusted
    software component running on every node that is used to route events from outputs
    to inputs. It recognizes three types of requests: AddConnection, HandleLocalEvent,
    and HandleRemoteEvent. A deployer can invoke AddConnection remotely to connect
    the output of a module to the input of another. How exactly inputs and outputs
    are identified is implementation specific but it will in some form involve specifying
    (1) a node address (e.g., an IP address); (2) an SM identifier; and (3) a connection
    identifier. As will become clear later, AddConnection only needs to be called
    on the event manager of the node where the output source module is deployed. HandleLocalEvent
    is used by modules to publish an event; i.e., inside the output wrappers. The
    arguments are the module and connection identifiers and the event payload. Based
    on the identifiers, the event manager looks up the destination event manager and
    invokes its HandleRemoteEvent API, providing the identifiers of the input to which
    the request should be routed. For a HandleRemoteEvent request, the event manager
    will check if the destination module exists and, if so, invoke its HandleInput
    entry point, passing the connection identifier and payload as arguments. 3.3.3
    Implementation. Although we introduced the module loader and the event manager
    as two separate software components, in our prototype we merged the functionalities
    of both in the same application, which we simply call the Event Manager. This
    design choice was made for the sake of simplicity: the actual implementation of
    such logical components is unimportant as long as each node provides the functionalities
    described above. 3.4 Physical Input and Output Channels We assume that the infrastructure
    offers physical input and output channels using protected driver modules that
    translate application events into physical events and vice versa. Driver modules
    control these physical events – sensing and actuation – within the boundaries
    of the processor executing the driver. For input channels, these modules generate
    events that correspond to physical events and provide a way for application modules
    to authenticate the generated events. For output channels, a driver module ( M
    D ) must have exclusive access to its I/O device (D) and allow an application
    module ( M A ) to take exclusive access over the driver. That is, the driver will
    only accept events – and hence translate them to physical events – from the application
    module currently connected to it. Below, we put explicit requirements on the implementation
    of secure I/O and mark them for later reference. First, we demand that IO1: the
    infrastructure provider configures the physical I/O devices as expected, i.e.,
    the desired peripherals are connected to the right pins and thus mapped to the
    correct Memory-Mapped I/O (MMIO) addresses in the node. Since misconfiguration
    in the physical world cannot be detected by remote attestation, we need to require
    that I/O devices are set up correctly. However, IO2: the infrastructure must provide
    a way for the deployer of M A to attest that it has exclusive access to the driver
    module M D and that M D also has exclusive access to its I/O device D. The deployer
    must be able to attest M D to ensure that it indeed only accepts events from the
    module currently having exclusive access and that it does not release this exclusive
    access without being asked to do so by the module itself. We also need to require
    that, IO3: after a microcontroller is turned on, only authenticated driver modules
    may take control of I/O devices. Once control is taken it is exclusive and never
    released. This prevents attackers from taking direct control of output devices
    after a node resets. Driver modules are thus part of the trusted computing base
    and their module keys are only known to the infrastructure provider who authorizes
    exclusive connections to driver modules upon request from the deployer and keeps
    track of the “ownership” of the driver modules. Finally, we demand that IO4: output
    driver modules do not produce outputs unless requested by the application module,
    while input driver modules only generate outputs to application modules that correspond
    to physical inputs. To summarize, we have modeled physical output channels in
    such a way that: (1) At startup, authenticated output driver modules take ownership
    over the (correct) output devices. Unauthorized access and connection attempts
    from other software are forbidden; (2) Application modules can take ownership
    of an output driver module only if the latter is not already connected to other
    modules, and only if authorized by the infrastructure provider; (3) After connecting
    to an output driver module, an application module retains exclusive access to
    the output device until explicitly released. Thanks to point (1), exclusive access
    is retained even across resets, although all connections need to be re-established.
    For input modules, exclusive access is not strictly required. However, exclusive
    access to input devices can be configured in the same way as for outputs, if desired.
    These conditions lead to the following security properties: — Assume that for
    a time interval T the infrastructure provider only ever authorizes application
    module M A to take control of device D via driver module M D . If the deployer
    attests within T that M A has taken exclusive access over output driver module
    M D , then from that moment until the end of T every output from D can be explained
    alone by the code semantics of M A and M D in relation to the inputs received
    by M A , i.e., no other module may cause outputs of D. — If the deployer attests
    that M A has taken access over an input driver module M D , then from that moment
    on until the access is released any output from M A can be explained alone by
    the code semantics of M A and M D in relation to the physical inputs to D and
    any other inputs received by M A , i.e., an attacker cannot spoof inputs to D
    for M A . In practice, I/O devices may produce initialization outputs when a driver
    module takes control of them after a reset. Handling these outputs is part of
    the specificities of a driver implementation, which we ignore here for simplicity.
    3.5 Deployment Deployment is the act of installing application modules on their
    nodes and setting up connections between outputs and inputs. As a requirement
    for deployment, D1: the channel between deployer and infrastructure provider is
    assumed to be secure, whereas communication with modules is performed over an
    untrusted network. In phase 1, the deployer requests access to the driver modules
    connected to physical I/O devices from the infrastructure provider who provides
    these modules. For output devices, the deployer requests exclusive access, while
    for input devices the deployer can choose between exclusive or shared access.
    Before granting such access, D2: the infrastructure provider needs to ensure the
    authenticity of the driver module controlling the I/O device, e.g., via attestation.
    If, for any reason, the infrastructure provider cannot give access to some I/O
    devices (e.g., because an output device is already taken by someone else), the
    deployment is aborted. Otherwise, the deployer receives connection keys from the
    infrastructure provider (one for each I/O device), along with the guarantee that
    driver modules have correctly taken control of the physical I/O devices (Section
    3.4). Phase 2 consists of deploying the application on the infrastructure. First,
    the deployer starts by compiling each source module into a loadable image. Second,
    the deployment descriptor is used to find the node on which the module should
    be deployed and sends its module loader a LoadModule request. The deployer then
    performs the TEE-specific method of attestation calling the Attest entry point
    of each SM, and eventually setting up the module key. At the end of this step,
    the deployer has a secure communication channel with each of its deployed source
    modules. Finally, the deployer sets up the connections between modules, as well
    as the connections to the driver modules. Regarding the former, the deployer generates
    a unique connection key and sends it to both endpoints of the connection; for
    each endpoint, such key is encrypted using the module key and passed to the SetKey
    entry point using the CallEntry API. Concerning the latter, instead, connections
    are established via a similar interface, using the keys obtained in phase 1. Security
    Discussion. During phase 1, the infrastructure provider plays an important role
    as a trusted party, providing exclusive access to driver modules. D3: It is required
    that the provider does not leak the driver module keys and that exclusive access
    to a device is reserved for the deployer until they request to release it or a
    time T has passed (to which both the deployer and the provider have agreed upon).
    In other words, no one else can acquire credentials to connect to the driver module
    during that time. If a reset on a node N occurs, then all driver modules belonging
    to that node need to be re-initialized, and exclusive access re-configured (if
    previously set). Concerning the latter, D4: the infrastructure must provide replay
    protection for messages exchanged in the protocol to establish exclusive driver
    access, otherwise replay attacks might cause exclusive access to be unintentionally
    set up for modules that formerly had access, but should not have it anymore. Concerning
    application modules instead, a reset on node N would cause all modules of that
    node to be re-deployed, re-attested, and connections for them to be re-established.
    Here, an attacker could technically mount a sophisticated replay attack to restore
    a previous configuration of an application; however, if replay protections for
    driver modules are correctly in place (as discussed above), the attacker would
    not be able to trigger any illicit or stale outputs. Note that the strong requirements
    on physical output drivers do not apply for virtual outputs to software endpoints,
    such as secure databases or nodes belonging to a trusted party like the deployer.
    Such receivers can verify the authenticity and freshness of outputs via cryptographic
    means and reject replayed messages automatically, which is not possible for physical
    outputs to the real world. 3.6 Security Argument Our goal is to ensure that all
    physical output events can be explained by the application’s source code and the
    observed physical input events. More precisely: Consider a time frame starting
    at the end of phase 1 of deployment (Section 3.5), and ending at a point where
    the deployer releases exclusive access to any of the output devices they control.
    Assume the deployer has observed a specific sequence of physical output events
    on one of these devices D O in the considered time frame, then there have been
    contiguous sequences of physical input events on the input devices connected to
    the application such that the observed outputs follow from these inputs according
    to the application source code semantics. As an example, consider A Flo (Figure
    3(a)). If, after the application has been deployed, the water supply is turned
    off, then there must have been physical input events that caused the field to
    flood. Output events can only be produced by the application’s SMs; the assumption
    of a correct compiler and the successful attestation then lead to the desired
    property. Due to requirements IO1-IO4, (1) a physical output event can only be
    produced by the corresponding device ( D O ); (2) output drivers have exclusive
    access to their device; and (3) an SM ( M O ) has exclusive access to the driver;
    thus only M O can initiate physical outputs on D O . Even if exclusive access
    is lost, e.g., due to a reset of the corresponding node triggered by an attacker,
    the infrastructure prevents that any other module can take control of D O and
    produce rogue outputs, thanks to requirements D1-D4. The construction of SMs ensures
    that a module can only be invoked through its two entry points. Of these, only
    HandleInput can result in output events (Figures 4 and 5). Since HandleInput authenticates
    its input, output events are always the result of correct input events. Finally,
    as our deployment scheme only allows for two types of correct input events, physical
    input events and outputs from other modules, our security property follows. 3.7
    Software Updates and Re-Deployment In Section 3.5, we described a static deployment
    where the whole application is deployed at once; however, it is also possible
    to deploy application modules dynamically. Specifically in scenarios where the
    configuration of an application may change during its lifetime due to the reconfiguration,
    addition, or removal of sensors or processing nodes, or the deployment of additional
    applications on existing infrastructure, software updates become essential. In
    our smart irrigation system from Figure 1, this may, e.g., happen with changing
    environmental conditions or when plots are re-allocated for different crops. Two
    common scenarios that may occur at runtime are software updates and re-deployments.
    The former consists of deploying an updated version of an SMs that, e.g., provides
    new functionality or fixes some bugs; the latter does not necessarily require
    code changes but may be needed when an SM crashes or needs to be migrated to another
    node. Our design for software updates and re-deployments consists of three steps:
    (1) Deployment of the new SM. In the first step, the new SM is compiled, deployed
    on the infrastructure alongside the already running SMs, and finally attested.
    If any of these operations fails, the update is aborted. Note that the new SM
    will not process any events until connections are configured through its SetKey
    entry point (step 3). (2) Deactivation of the old SM. In this step, the old SM
    is removed from the infrastructure. This is the point in time from which the application
    will start suffering from connectivity loss, until the new SM will be completely
    configured. Optionally, state may be transferred to the new SM before taking down
    the old one. (3) Re-establishment of connections. Here, all the connections associated
    with the old SM must be re-configured in order to point to the new SM. This process
    involves calling the SetKey and AddConnection entry points on the involved SMs
    and event managers, as for a static deployment (Section 3.5); each connection
    retains its connection identifier, but keys are rotated for security reasons.
    Similarly, connections between the SM and I/O devices must be re-configured as
    well, if any (Section 3.4). At the end of this step, the update will be completed.
    We evaluate the impact of software updates in Section 5.3.3. Note that actions
    2 and 3 can also be executed in reverse order, if desired. Re-establishing the
    connections before disabling the old SM would result in a smaller availability
    disruption, but it may also cause an inconsistent state if events are generated
    during the update. For example, some events might be processed by the old SM and
    some other events by the new SM, causing undefined behavior. As our framework
    mainly focuses on integrity rather than availability, we should prevent such inconsistencies
    from occurring, for example by implementing a sort of synchronization mechanism
    between old and new SMs during the update. However, this would increase the complexity
    of our framework without providing substantial benefits compared to our original
    update strategy. Hence, we decided not to investigate this option further. Transferring
    the state from the old to the new SM may be done in several ways. For instance,
    the sealing feature of certain TEEs (such as Intel SGX) allows an SM to securely
    store data persistently on disk, although it requires the new SM to be deployed
    on the same node as the old one. Our design already provides some basic support
    for state transfer by creating a temporary connection between the two SMs. In
    particular, a transfer output in the old SM may be connected to a restore input
    in the new SM, then the state migration can be triggered by calling a save entry
    point in the old SM that generates the transfer event. This would allow the state
    to be securely transferred between the two modules, even in different nodes. Of
    course, the deployer still needs to manually implement the save and restore functions
    in order to specify what data needs to be migrated. This protocol, however, requires
    the old SM to be up and running at the time of the update, and therefore cannot
    be applied if the module was disabled before, e.g., due to a crash or a reset
    on the node. Skip 4IMPLEMENTATION Section 4 IMPLEMENTATION Originally [51], we
    created a fully functional prototype of our design based on the hardware-only
    embedded TEE Sancus [50]. In later work [59], we extended our support to the commercial
    Intel SGX [46], a TEE for high-end x86 processors. Lately, we added support for
    a third TEE, based on ARM devices equipped with TrustZone technology [5]. As the
    implementations for all TEEs are compatible with each other, we can support heterogeneous
    deployments in which an SM can send protected events to any other SMs, regardless
    of the actual TEE technologies used. This enables a wide variety of use cases
    that combine sensing and actuation with clod and edge processing. As such, our
    running example in precision agriculture is scalable from small local applications
    such as an automated irrigation system to more complex deployments that feature,
    e.g., a wide range of sensors and actuators, and that involve complex data aggregation
    and processing. For example, we could have an authentic trace that starts from
    a Sancus sensor that leverages Secure I/O to collect measurements, then continues
    on a TrustZone gateway that forwards the measurements to an Intel SGX aggregator
    in the cloud, and finally ends with a command to actuate an output I/O device,
    sent back to a Sancus output driver through the same TrustZone gateway. This chapter
    is structured as follows: Sections 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3 describe each of these three
    implementations separately, emphasizing on the features of their underlying TEEs.
    For each implementation we describe (1) the underlying security architecture,
    including data and code isolation as well as the root of trust, (2) the process
    of compiling applications into security modules and the processing of inputs and
    outputs, (3) the untrusted runtime, in particular the realization of the LoadModule
    and CallEntry requests, (4) the attestation protocol including the generation
    of attestation evidence and the establishment of module keys, (5) the configuration
    of secure communication endpoints, and (6) where available, the realization of
    secure I/O channels, protected driver modules, and relevant implementation requirements
    (IO1-D4). The main differences of the three implementations are then summarized
    in Section 4.4. Next, Section 4.5 illustrates the deployment phase. Finally, Section
    4.6 introduces an optional component used to facilitate attestation and key management.
    4.1 Sancus Sancus [50] is an OpenMSP430-based TEEs designed for low-cost and low-power
    embedded applications. As described in Section 3.1, Sancus divides SMs in two
    sections, the (public) code section and the (private) data section, enforcing
    strict access rules for both. An SM’s code section can only be entered through
    a single entry point: its first instruction. The compiler assigns each user-defined
    entry point an integer identifier and adds an entry stub that evaluates such an
    identifier, dispatching to the correct entry point. Besides, private data is only
    accessible by the module’s code. 4.1.1 Enclave Development. The Sancus toolchain
    comes with a C compiler, libraries, and other tools that are needed to develop
    and build applications composed of one or more Sancus enclaves. Developers can
    define enclaves by annotating code and data using special macros defined in the
    Sancus trusted library: functions can be marked as either entry points or internal
    functions, using the SM_ENTRY and SM_FUNC macros respectively. Besides, variables
    annotated with SM_DATA will be allocated in the private data section, making it
    accessible only from inside the enclave. Furthermore, Sancus provides an untrusted
    library to initialize enclaves and call their entry points. Pointers passed to
    an entry point must be properly sanitized to ensure that they do not point to
    enclave memory. Return values, instead, are copied from trusted to untrusted memory.
    The untrusted library also provides a function to dynamically load new enclaves
    at runtime; in our framework, this functionality is used to deploy application
    SMs. At compile time, the Sancus compiler builds the application into a single
    binary that includes both untrusted runtime (e.g., the main function) and static
    enclaves. Such binary can then be loaded into a Sancus microcontroller using the
    dedicated loader. Besides, the Sancus toolchain also provides a tool to retrieve
    the module key of an enclave given a binary file, which is essential in order
    to attest the enclave from outside the microcontroller (Section 4.1.4). 4.1.2
    APIs. Our implementation is a literal translation of the design outlined in Section
    3.2. All modifications to the Sancus compiler are extensions, and all original
    Sancus features are still available to programmers (e.g., calling external functions
    or other SMs). On top of the existing annotations, we added two new ones: SM_INPUT
    and SM_OUTPUT for specifying inputs and outputs. Figure 9 shows an example module
    written in C using our annotations. Fig. 9. Fig. 9. A translation of module M
    FloS1 (Figures 2 and 3(a)) to C using the annotations understood by our compiler.
    SM_OUTPUT expects a name as argument (more specifically, a valid C identifier).
    For every output, the compiler generates a function with the following signature:
    uint16_t name(char* data, size_t len). This function can be called to produce
    an output event. For input handlers, SM_INPUT generates a function with the same
    signature as above. In this function, the programmer has access to a buffer containing
    the (unwrapped) payload of the event that caused its execution. For both inputs
    and outputs, the names provided in annotations are used in the deployment descriptor.
    4.1.3 Untrusted Runtime. The untrusted runtime consists of a single application,
    the event manager, which implements all the untrusted API requests described in
    Section 3.3. The ELF binary is compiled together with a ported version of RIOT
    OS [7], an operating system specifically designed for devices with limited resources
    such as our OpenMSP430-based Sancus. Our event manager was initially developed
    for an experimental version of Sancus RIOT [4]. Future work will adapt the event
    manager to the latest Sancus hardware and RIOT, in order to fully leverage common
    OS features as well as the protected scheduler, a fundamental component for providing
    availability guarantees to Sancus enclaves, as discussed in Section 6.2. 4.1.4
    Attestation and Secure Channels. Sancus uses a three-level key hierarchy for remote
    attestation and secure communication. Every node contains a node key, which is
    only known by the node’s owner, the infrastructure provider. Every vendor who
    is to install SMs on a particular node is assigned a unique identifier. The second
    level of keys, vendor keys, is derived from the node key and these vendor identifiers.
    Finally, module keys are derived from a vendor key using an SMs module identity.
    This module identity – the concatenation of the contents of the module’s code
    section and the load addresses of both its sections – is used for authentication
    and attestation. The module key is calculated by the Sancus hardware when a module
    is loaded and can also be calculated by the module’s vendor. Since the hardware
    ensures that module keys can only be accessed by the corresponding SM, it is guaranteed
    that the use of a certain module key (e.g., by creating a Message Authentication
    Code (MAC)) implicitly attests the module’s identity. The Attest entry point (Section
    3.2) leverages a challenge-response protocol to verify that a Sancus SM is up
    and running on a specific node at a certain time. The challenge consists of a
    random sequence of bytes generated by the deployer, long enough to prevent replay
    attacks. The Sancus SM computes a Message Authentication Code (MAC) over the challenge
    using its module key, and sends the result back to the deployer. The latter performs
    the same operation: attestation can be considered successful if the result matches
    the response provided by the SM. Sancus’ crypto engine uses SpongeWrap [9] as
    encryption algorithm with spongent [10] as the underlying hash function to calculate
    MACs. The interface to the crypto engine is provided by two instructions: Encrypt
    takes a plaintext buffer, associated data (which will be authenticated but not
    encrypted), and a key and produces the ciphertext and an authentication tag (i.e.,
    a MAC); Decrypt, given the ciphertext, associated data, tag and key, produces
    the original plaintext or raises an error if the tag is invalid. For both instructions,
    the key is an optional argument with the calling module’s key as a default value.
    As with the original version of Sancus, this is the only way for a module to use
    its key. 4.1.5 Secure I/O. This section describes how protected drivers can be
    implemented using Sancus. Remember that, for output channels, we want an application
    module to have exclusive access to a driver (Section 3.4). This, in turn, implies
    that the driver should have exclusive access to the physical I/O device. Although
    for input channels the requirements are less strict – we only need to authenticate
    a device – for simplicity, we also use exclusive device access here. Exclusive
    Access to Device Registers. Sancus, being based on the OpenMSP430 architecture,
    uses MMIO to communicate with devices. Thus, providing exclusive access to device
    registers is supported out of the box by mapping the driver’s private section
    over the device’s Memory-Mapped I/O (MMIO) region. There is one difficulty, however,
    caused by the private section of Sancus modules being contiguous and the OpenMSP430
    having a fixed MMIO region (i.e., the addresses used for MMIO cannot be remapped).
    Thus, a Sancus module can use its private section either for MMIO or for data
    but not for both. Therefore, a module using MMIO cannot use any memory, including
    a stack, severely limiting the functionality this module can implement. We decided
    to solve this in software: Driver modules can be split into two modules, one performing
    only MMIO (mod-mmio) and one using the API provided by the former module to implement
    the driver logic (mod-driver). The task of mod-mmio is straightforward: for each
    available MMIO location it implements entry points for reading and writing this
    location, and ignores calls by modules other than mod-driver. This task is simple
    enough to be implemented using only registers for data storage, negating the need
    for an extra data section. This technique lets us implement exclusive access to
    device registers on Sancus without changing the hardware representation of modules.
    Yet, it incurs a non-negligible performance impact because mod-mmio has to attest
    mod-driver on every call to one of its entry points. Doing the attestation once
    and only checking the module identifier on subsequent calls is not applicable
    because it requires memory for storing the identifier. We address this by hard-coding
    the expected identifier of mod-driver in the code section of mod-mmio. During
    initialization, mod-driver checks if it is assigned the expected identifier and
    otherwise aborts. mod-driver also attests mod-mmio, verifying module integrity
    and exclusive access to the device’s MMIO registers. On failure, mod-driver aborts
    as well. The expected identifier of mod-driver can be easily deduced as Sancus
    assigns identifiers in order: the first loaded module takes identifier 1, the
    second 2, and so forth. Sancus did not support caller authentication [50], which
    we require for mod-mmio to ensure invocation by mod-driver only. We added this
    feature by storing the identifier of the previously executing module in a new
    register, and added instructions to read and verify this SM identity. Secure Interrupts.
    On the OpenMSP430, interrupt handlers are registered by writing their address
    to the interrupt vector, a specific memory location. Thus, handling interrupts
    inside SMs is done by registering a module’s entry point as an interrupt handler.
    If the SM also supports “normal” entry points, a way to detect whether the entry
    point is called in response to an interrupt is required. More generally, we need
    a way to identify which interrupt caused an interrupt handler to be executed.
    Otherwise, an attacker might be able to inject events into an application by spoofing
    calls to an interrupt handler. To this end, we extended the technique used for
    caller authentication. When an interrupt occurs, the processor stores a special
    value specific to that interrupt in the new register to keep track of the previously
    executing module. This way, an interrupt handler can identify by which interrupt
    it was called in the same way modules can identify which module called one of
    their entry points. The processor ensures that these special values used to identify
    interrupts are never assigned to any SM. Interfacing with Applications. Our implementation
    follows the design in Section 3.4 to connect an application SM to a driver SM
    via connection keys. As we assume that driver modules are provided by the infrastructure,
    a deployer needs to interact with the infrastructure provider for the distribution
    of connection keys to the drivers. In fact, these keys need to be encrypted and
    authenticated using an SM’s module key which, for driver modules, are only known
    by the infrastructure provider. In our implementation, driver and MMIO modules
    are static enclaves embedded in the application binary loaded in the Sancus microcontroller
    (Section 4.1.1). At startup, these modules are immediately initialized to gain
    exclusive access to their I/O devices (IO3). To change this behavior, an attacker
    would require physical access to the microcontroller in order to upload a malicious
    binary; however, this is out of scope (Section 2.3). The infrastructure provider
    can then keep track of which deployer has exclusive access to a driver SM at a
    certain time, denying requests coming from other deployers for the whole duration
    of the exclusive access period, or until the deployer explicitly gives up access
    (D3). In our case, giving exclusive access means encrypting and authenticating
    the connection key (provided by the deployer) with the driver’s module key, sending
    the result data back to the deployer; the communication between deployer and infrastructure
    provider should be done via a secure channel. The deployer would then be able
    to gain exclusive access to the driver SM by calling its SetKey entry point (or
    equivalent) using the encrypted payload as argument. Regarding input drivers,
    the infrastructure provider may allow non-exclusive access by simply accepting
    requests from multiple deployers at the same time; if needed, a deployer may ask
    for exclusive access by adding an additional bit of information to the request.
    To prevent replay attacks, the payload passed to the SetKey entry point contains
    a unique nonce that the driver SM can verify against a reference stored in memory
    (D4). This nonce must be rotated every time exclusive access is reconfigured.
    In summary, our design for Secure I/O in Sancus consists of the following protocol:
    (1) The deployer sends an initial request to the driver SM asking for its current
    nonce. The driver retrieves the nonce from secure memory and sends it back to
    the deployer. (2) The deployer then sends the nonce and the connection key to
    the infrastructure provider via a secure channel (D1). Due to the static driver
    setup in Sancus, the provider knows that only authentic drivers have control of
    I/O devices (D2). The provider only ensures that the driver SM is not already
    taken by someone else and, if so, may grant the deployer exclusive access. To
    this end, the provider encrypts and authenticates the input data with the driver’s
    module key, returning it to the deployer. (3) The deployer then forwards the encrypted
    payload to the driver SM, which decrypts and authenticates it. If the nonce matches
    with the one stored in memory, the driver establishes exclusive access by storing
    the connection key into memory and using said key to decrypt future payloads.
    Finally, the driver sends an authenticated confirmation to the deployer using
    the same connection key, then generates a new nonce for the next run of the protocol.
    Since only authentic drivers can decrypt the data using their module keys and
    complete the protocol illustrated above, the reception of the confirmation message
    allows the deployer to conclude that they indeed have acquired exclusive access
    to the desired I/O device (IO2). If the protocol does not complete for any reason
    (e.g., an attacker blocks one of the messages between driver and deployer), the
    deployer would never receive a confirmation from the driver SM; as such, the deployer
    would not trust outputs generated by that driver. In case of node resets, the
    deployer would not lose exclusive access to the driver because the infrastructure
    provider would not complete step (2) of the protocol with another deployer (D3).
    However, the original deployer would have to run the protocol again to restore
    connectivity, rotating connection keys to prevent replay attacks. An important
    aspect to consider is that monotonic counters as nonces are not enough to prevent
    replay attacks, because in case of resets on the node, the driver module would
    lose information about the current nonce. This problem can be solved by either
    (1) storing the current nonce in secure persistent storage, or (2) generating
    a random nonce each time. As Sancus currently provides neither persistent storage
    nor an RNG, we leave this issue to future work. 4.2 Intel SGX Intel SGX is a TEE
    included in commercial Intel processors, consisting of hardware primitives and
    a set of instructions that can be used to isolate the code and data of an application
    in protected memory regions called enclaves. Access to enclave memory is restricted
    at runtime and only accessible by code within the enclave, and the enclave can
    only be entered through specific entry points. Thus, neither the host OS nor other
    software can access enclaves’ code and memory, which results in a reduced TCB.
    The architecture of Intel SGX provides an enclave with an enclave measurement
    called MRENCLAVE. This reflects the enclave identity and consists of a SHA-256
    hash over the content of the enclave’s code and data at initialization time. This
    enclave identity is complemented by the author identity, called the MRSIGNER,
    which reflects the hash of the enclave’s author’s public key. This author is the
    entity who signs the enclave before distribution. These two identities are then
    used as reference values for both local and remote attestation, as well as to
    generate sealing keys that allow the enclave to securely store persistent data
    on a disk. 4.2.1 Enclave Development. To develop an Intel SGX application, Intel
    provides its own SDK written in C/C++. Here, the application is partitioned into
    two sections: the untrusted code and the enclave. Communication between trusted
    and untrusted applications is made through a specific interface, defined by the
    developer using a C-like syntax called Enclave Definition Language (EDL). Calls
    from the untrusted application to the enclave are made via well-defined entry
    points named ECALLs, while untrusted functions are made available to the enclave
    via OCALLs. Recently, new frameworks have been introduced that allow developers
    to write enclaves in modern languages and with reduced effort. In our framework,
    we leverage Fortanix Enclave Development Platform (EDP) [22], an SDK written entirely
    in the memory-safe Rust. Enclave Development Platform (EDP) abstracts the Intel
    SGX layer away from a developer, who can write an enclave similar to a native
    application; the necessary bindings are automatically added at compile time. EDP
    is seamlessly integrated with the Rust standard library, although some functionalities
    are not available for security reasons. 4.2.2 APIs. Our implementation of the
    design illustrated in Section 3.2 aims at reducing the development effort as much
    as possible. As described above, Fortanix EDP already gives huge benefits to a
    developer by abstracting the Intel SGX layer away, taking care of secure argument
    passing, data and code isolation, and so on. In addition, our framework provides
    a simple mechanism to declare outputs and inputs by using code annotations, which
    are parsed by the framework at deployment time in order to retrieve information
    about the module’s endpoints and to inject required code. These annotations are
    analogous to the Sancus implementation described in Section 4.1.2, although we
    rely on special single-line comments instead of using macros (Figure 10). Fig.
    10. Fig. 10. A translation of module M FloS1 (Figures 2 and 3(a)) to Rust using
    the annotations understood by our Intel SGX parser. Output and input events are
    designed to be asynchronous: after an output event is generated, the SM resumes
    its execution immediately, and no return values are expected. Asynchronous events
    work well if they are generated from physical events (e.g., a button press), as
    the only purpose of the associated SM is to notify one or more other SMs to which
    it has active connections. However, in some other cases, synchronous events might
    be necessary, for example for querying a database. Here, a return value is expected
    and the SM that generated the output event might want to block the execution until
    the value is received. To address this need, the Intel SGX implementation comes
    with two additional annotations: //@ sm_request and //@ sm_handler. Request-handler
    events are similar to output-input events, however a request blocks the execution
    until the connected handler (if exists) returns a value. 4.2.3 Untrusted Runtime.
    The untrusted runtime consists of an untrusted Linux process that implements the
    logic illustrated in Section 3.3. Concerning the execution of new SMs, Fortanix
    EDP provides a default runner for Intel SGX enclaves called ftxsgx-runner, responsible
    for loading and executing an enclave. Thus, when a new LoadModule request arrives,
    the event manager spawns a new process using the Rust’s std::process::Command
    API, executing ftxsgx-runner and passing as an argument the enclave’s binary and
    signature. To realize CallEntry requests, our SGX compiler adds a simple TCP server
    as a front-end to the SM. At compile time, each SM is assigned a free port in
    the same network namespace as the event manager, so that they can exchange events
    with each other via localhost. 4.2.4 Remote Attestation and Secure Channels. In
    short, the remote attestation of an Intel SGX enclave consists of the following
    steps: (1) a remote entity (the challenger) sends an attestation request to the
    enclave. The request should contain a challenge that will be included in the attestation
    evidence to provide freshness; (2) the enclave (the prover) generates an attestation
    evidence, also called Quote, that is returned to the challenger. This Quote includes
    information about the identity of the enclave and the platform on which the enclave
    is running (hardware information, microcode version, etc.); (3) the challenger
    verifies the quote by first ensuring its authenticity and second verifying that
    the enclave and hardware are in the expected state. A quote is generated by a
    dedicated enclave called Quoting Enclave (QE), which resides on the same platform
    as the enclave to be attested. The quote is protected using cryptographic keys
    unique to that particular platform. A trusted third party is then responsible
    for the quote verification, to ensure that (1) the quote is authentic, and (2)
    the hardware and firmware of the platform are up to date. After that, the challenger
    verifies the identity of the enclave, ensures that the quote is fresh (i.e., the
    challenge is included in the quote), and finally decides whether to trust or not
    the enclave. Our framework supports the Enhanced Privacy ID (EPID) attestation
    scheme1 [29], for which a Rust implementation already existed.2 The scheme also
    involves a mutually-authenticated Diffie-Hellman key exchange between challenger
    and enclave; we leverage this protocol to establish a shared secret between a
    module and its deployer, which will be used as the module key. 4.2.5 Secure I/O.
    Unfortunately, SGX does not support secure I/O channels out of the box. In fact,
    it is by design impossible to map DMA devices into enclave memory [14]. While
    academic solutions have been proposed to overcome these issues (Section 7.3),
    they usually require additional trusted hardware [72] and software [37, 55, 69]
    to establish tamper-proof, exclusive channels to I/O devices. Hence, our framework
    does not support physical I/O channels for SGX-based SMs. Nevertheless, in the
    IoT settings we envision, SGX-based modules will likely be deployed in edge or
    cloud computing platforms where physical inputs and outputs are less relevant.
    Instead, such modules may be used for monitoring and control of a number of IoT
    gateways or devices. As such, they would be connected to virtual endpoints in
    the deployer’s trusted back-end system using credentials that are securely stored
    in enclave memory. 4.3 ARM TrustZone TrustZone is a very common TEE implemented
    in the different flavors of recent ARM processors, which applies strong system-level
    isolation by separating both system hardware and software resources into two domains,
    namely the Normal World, and the Secure World, protecting the code and data in
    the secure world from being directly accessed or modified by the normal world
    [56]. To perform the secure context switching between worlds, ARM Cortex-A processors
    introduced a new CPU mode called monitor mode, which runs at the highest execution
    level of the secure world. The monitor mode can be entered via an interrupt, external
    abort, or explicit call of a special privileged instruction: Secure Monitor Call.
    Then, the value of the least significant bit of the Secure Configuration Register,
    known as the Non-Secure bit is changed and propagated through the AXI system bus
    to the memory and peripherals to preserve the process security state. On ARM Cortex-M
    processors, hardware is responsible for the transition between worlds, which optimizes
    switching overhead [49, 56]. In this article, we only focused on the features
    of TrustZone for Cortex-A processors. The normal world runs a general-purpose
    operating system, such as Linux or Android, and untrusted (client) applications,
    while a lightweight TEE operating system and trusted applications (TAs) run in
    the secure world. In this article, we rely on Open Portable Trusted Execution
    Environment (OP-TEE) [38], which implements a secure operating system (the OP-TEE
    OS), a secure monitor, a non-secure user-space library called OP-TEE client exposed
    to the client applications, and a set of build toolchains to facilitate the development
    of TAs. TrustZone relies on a secure boot process to prevent a system from being
    attacked during the booting process and enforce a strong system integrity policy.
    Secure boot forms a Chain of Trust by leveraging a signature scheme based on RSA
    to verify system images before their execution [41]. Concretely, the boot process
    operates as a sequence of stages, each former boot stage loads and checks the
    signatures of the next follow-on stage, usually initiated from the root of trust
    (RoT). RoT is usually a public key that is stored in the trusted root-key storage
    registers and cannot be modified [6]. 4.3.1 TA Development. To develop a TA, OP-TEE
    provides its own SDK to both build and sign the TA binary with a private RSA key,
    then the signature is verified by OP-TEE OS upon loading of the TA to check its
    integrity. A TA must implement a couple of mandatory C-like syntax entry points
    to allocate some session resources and execute the target services. Communication
    with a TA is established by initiating a request from the client application through
    some defined entry points in the OP-TEE client to load the intended TA binary
    and its libraries into the secure memory. To identify a TA to be used, the client
    provides a unique 16-byte value called UUID that is generated by the developer.
    Then, the desired services in the TA are invoked from the client application by
    passing a so-called command ID which is also defined at compile time. 4.3.2 API.
    In our framework, we intend to provide a high-level abstraction over the TEE layer
    that allows developers to focus only on application logic. Further to the abstraction
    provided by GlobalPlatform TEE Internal Core API in OP-TEE, we define annotations
    SM_ENTRY, SM_INPUT, and SM_OUTPUT similar to the mechanism described in Section
    4.1.2 to specify respectively entry points, inputs, and outputs of each TA. The
    provided annotations take a name as an argument that is chosen by the developer.
    Then, our framework produces the desired functions using some defined macros at
    deployment time. Likewise, the remaining required codes for developing a TA such
    as communication with a client application and cryptographic operations are injected
    by our framework automatically. Thereby, the provided abstraction enables the
    developer to implement complex logic without knowledge of the TA implementation
    in OP-TEE. 4.3.3 Untrusted Runtime. The untrusted runtime involves an unprotected
    application running on Linux which is called the event manager to implement all
    the components outlined in Section 3.3. Our event manager leverages the GlobalPlatform
    TEE Client API implemented in OP-TEE client library to communicate with TAs. This
    API provides a set of functionalities for initializing and running TAs in the
    secure world as well as mechanisms for passing data to them. Therefore, when a
    new LoadModule request arrives, the event manager first establishes a connection
    with TEE through TEEC_InitializeContext(...) function which returns a context
    object ctx. Second, a logical connection with a specific TA within the scope of
    ctx is created by passing UUID of the desired TA to TEEC_OpenSession(...) function.
    When a session is opened, the TA’s binary and its libraries are loaded into the
    secure memory. This session is then used to invoke the TA’s entry points for CallEntry
    requests using TEEC_ InvokeCommand(...), which takes as parameters a command ID
    defined for the intended entry point as well as the expected payload. Our event
    manager uses this operation payload to exchange events with a TA through shared
    memory. It is noteworthy to mention that the entry points verify the type of parameters
    before using them to check its value according to the expected parameter. In addition,
    the data passed to entry points is encrypted and authenticated. Thereby, any malicious
    attempts to call an undesired entry point or modify the payload would result in
    a failed cryptographic operation. 4.3.4 Remote Attestation and Secure Channels.
    Remote attestation is a crucial security feature for our framework that provides
    an authorized party with cryptographic proof that a known and benign TA is initially
    loaded on a valid TrustZone device. In contrast to Sancus and Intel SGX, the TrustZone
    specification offers no mechanism for remote attestation. Some existing approaches
    leverage hardware components such as a hardware Trusted Platform Module (TPM)
    or a firmware-based TPM (e.g., Microsoft’s fTPM [58]) that provides security guarantees
    similar to a hardware TPM, to perform attestation. In our work, we avoid the added
    complexity and substantial increase of the TCB, and introducing no additional
    hardware. Instead, we propose an attestation mechanism based on native TrustZone
    features. Our design is based on Sancus’ remote attestation scheme (Section 4.1).
    Analogously, our approach relies on symmetric cryptography and a three-level key
    hierarchy. We build upon an OP-TEE proof-of-concept implementation for remote
    attestation that requires minimal hardware features and assumptions,3 avoiding
    the use of an TPM/fTPM as they are not available on many platforms. We implemented
    an attestation protocol derived from the OP-TEE proof-of-concept to address the
    requirements of our framework, while minimizing the run-time TCB. Our scheme assumes
    that each TrustZone device is equipped with a Hardware Unique Key (HUK) (also
    called endorsement key in other technologies), which can be created at manufacture
    time and stored either in hardware fuses or the secure eMMC partition. Similar
    to hardware devices like the TPM or Sancus, the Hardware Unique Key (HUK) is protected
    from unauthorized access and can be used as root-of-trust of the TrustZone device.
    Since the secure boot process guarantees system integrity, OP-TEE can be treated
    as the trusted base for accessing the HUK, and the isolation properties provided
    by TrustZone protect secure-world code at run-time. Thus, we get a strong guarantee
    that the HUK can only be accessed by privileged code in the secure world. To leverage
    the HUK and provide attestation primitives to the TAs, we developed an attestation
    Pseudo Trusted Application (PTA)4 that is statically built into the OP-TEE core
    and runs at the same privileged execution level as the OP-TEE OS. Analogous to
    Sancus attestation, this Pseudo Trusted Application (PTA) uses a Key Derivation
    Function (KDF) to retrieve symmetric vendor and module keys from the HUK. In particular,
    the vendor key is computed as follows: vendor_key:=KDF(HUK∥vendor_id). Identically
    to Sancus (cf. Section 4.1), vendor_id is a unique identifier assigned to the
    software vendor, and the vendor_key needs to be securely communicated out-of-band.
    The vendor_id is then embedded in the TA code and passed to the PTA during the
    attestation process. The module key, instead, is computed as module_key:=KDF(vendor_key∥TA_hash).
    The TA hash is used by the OP-TEE OS to verify the integrity of the TA at load
    time.5 We made minimal changes to the OP-TEE OS to store the hash in secure memory
    after loading a TA, so that it could be retrieved by the attestation PTA for computing
    the module key. The module key can be also used to establish a secure communication
    channel between the TA and the remote party. Our remote attestation process shown
    in Figure 11 is illustrated in detailas follows: Fig. 11. Fig. 11. Our remote
    attestation process for ARM TrustZone with OP-TEE. Colored components are considered
    trusted in our architecture. (1) The verifier sends an attestation request to
    the client application running in the normal world on the target device. The request
    contains a randomly generated challenge to provide freshness. Then, the client
    application passes the received challenge to the intended TA through shared memory.
    (2) The TA leverages the attestation PTA to obtain the module key K. The attestation
    PTA performs a double derivation to retrieve the module key from the HUK, as explained
    above. To do so, the vendor identifier is passed as a parameter by the TA itself,
    whereas the TA hash is fetched from secure memory. After receiving K, the TA calculates
    a MAC D of the provided challenge. (3) The TA sends D to the client application
    through shared memory and then D is forwarded to the remote verifier. (4) The
    verifier derives the same module key K from the vendor key and TA hash. Then,
    the verifier uses K to compute a MAC of challenge and then compares it with the
    received MAC. If the two values match, the target device is authenticated and
    the TA integrity is verified. The Key Derivation Function (KDF) used in our proof-of-concept
    is a simple SHA-256 hash, though we truncate the module key to 128 bits to align
    its size with the other TEE implementations. For MAC function we leveraged the
    AES-128-GCM authenticated encryption scheme, using the challenge as associated
    data. Similarly to Sancus, attestation binds a TA to a specific node because the
    module key is (indirectly) derived from the HUK. Deploying the TA on a different
    node would result in a different module key. Since the TA’s UUID is hard-coded,
    multiple instances of the same TA would have different hashes and consequently
    different module keys, provided that each instance uses a different UUID. This
    attestation scheme gives strong guarantees that a TA is running expected code
    on a particular TrustZone node. The freshness of the challenge prevents replay
    attacks, ensuring that the TA is up and running at the time of the attestation.
    Adversaries cannot learn the module key by sniffing the network traffic, nor can
    they impersonate a TA to compute the response to the challenge. Besides, any attempt
    to modify the messages between TA and verifier would only result in a failed attestation.
    However, the scheme relies on the security of the HUK and vendor key: if a HUK
    is leaked, all TAs deployed on its corresponding TrustZone node are compromised,
    while leaks of a vendor key only compromises the TAs of its corresponding software
    vendor deployed on its corresponding node. Hence, a device manufacturer should
    provide software vendors with a secure interface (e.g., an authenticated API)
    to retrieve the vendor key for a specific TrustZone node. 4.3.5 Secure I/O. TrustZone
    leverages dedicated hardware components to enforce hardware isolation to the I/O
    devices. Specifically, TrustZone introduces the TrustZone Protection Controller
    to define the access restrictions for peripherals and configure them as secure
    and non-secure dynamically or statically. This is achieved by the reflection of
    Non-Secure bit into the respective peripheral. Several works take the advantage
    of TrustZone to establish a trusted I/O path for different purposes [15, 35, 63,
    77] (Section 7.3). Our framework does not support physical I/O channels for TrustZone-based
    modules yet but rather interfaces Sancus-enabled I/O devices. 4.4 Comparison:
    SMs on Different TEEs Table 1 summarizes the features of each TEE and highlights
    their main differences. This table is derived and adapted from [41]. Note that
    for TrustZone we consider OP-TEE OS with our attestation extensions. The key points
    that distinguish our TEEs are (a) software isolation which is supported by all
    three TEEs and where we provide common interfaces to control isolation and event
    handling; (b) attestation primitives, which are not available on all TEEs and
    we provide attestation support as necessary and establish common Attest entry
    point and event handler abstracting for our framework; and (c) secure I/O, which
    is only natively supported with Sancus and where we design generic scheme that
    can hopefully be instantiated by other TEEs, in particular by ARM TrustZone. Table
    1. Table 1. Comparison of TEE Hardware Features and the Resulting Security Guarantees
    and Application Capabilities in Our Framework This table is derived and adapted
    from [41]. a : We consider TrustZone with the OP-TEE OS and our extensions for
    attestation. Software isolation and attestation are strict requirements in our
    design (Section 3.1), which are fully satisfied by Intel SGX and Sancus. For TrustZone,
    instead, we relied on OP-TEE OS for isolation, whereas we designed and implemented
    our own attestation protocol based on Sancus (Section 4.3.4). Other than code
    integrity and authenticity, attestation may also provide additional information,
    such as the security configuration of the underlying TCB (Intel SGX), or the guarantee
    that an SM is running on a specific node (Sancus and TrustZone). The latter is
    particularly useful when dealing with driver modules (Section 3.4). Besides, only
    Intel SGX protects the integrity and authenticity of data from physical attacks,
    thanks to its Memory Encryption Engine (MEE). Both Intel SGX and TrustZone support
    sealing, i.e., storing data securely on permanent storage. However, our framework
    does not currently provide any abstraction over sealing primitives, meaning that
    developers need to manually implement code to call such primitives. Similarly,
    code confidentiality (i.e., deploying encrypted SMs in order to protect sensitive
    code and static data) is a feature supported by all architectures, though not
    essential for the use cases we consider. Nevertheless, both sealing and code confidentiality
    could be addressed in future work. Besides, Sancus fully supports secure I/O (Section
    4.1.5), while on TrustZone and Intel SGX, some extensions are needed, as proposed
    in related work (Section 7.3). Concerning architectural features, only Sancus
    provides an hardware-only trusted computing base. In fact, Intel SGX relies on
    software parts such as microcode and attestation enclaves, while TrustZone includes
    the whole OP-TEE operating system in its TCB. However, the software can be easily
    upgraded to provide new functionalities or fix bugs, which is why Intel SGX and
    TrustZone support TCB upgrades. Furthermore, both TrustZone and Intel SGX have
    full support for interrupts and dynamic layout (i.e., virtual memory). Sancus,
    being an embedded TEE, does not support virtual memory, whereas for interrupts
    we offer partial support (Section 4.1.5). 4.5 Deployment We developed a Python
    script called reactive-tools to ease the deployment and initialization of a distributed
    application. In essence, this script builds the SMs and then communicates with
    the remote event managers to bootstrap enclaves and establish connections (Section
    3.3). reactive-tools takes as input a deployment descriptor, a configuration file
    that contains a high-level description of the application to deploy. 4.5.1 Deployment
    Descriptor. The deployment descriptor contains three main sections: nodes, modules,
    and connections. Figure 12 shows an excerpt from one of our sample applications.
    Fig. 12. Fig. 12. Excerpt from a deployment descriptor in YAML format. Three main
    sections are defined: nodes, modules, and connections. Each node and module has
    a type field indicating the TEE technology used; besides the fields that are common
    to all TEEs, each platform also requires other specific parameters. The fields
    of a connection, instead, do not change. The complete deployment descriptor (in
    JSON format) used in this example can be found at https://github.com/AuthenticExecution/examples/blob/main/button-led/descriptor.json.
    As shown in the figure, a module is statically assigned to a node and a specific
    TEE technology. This is a limitation of our framework as each TEE implementation
    uses its own API and programming language. A possible direction for future work
    could be to use an unified language for defining modules, which can be an existing
    programming language such as Rust or a custom language such as the pseudocode
    we used in Figure 3; then, the framework could automatically select the right
    compiler/toolchain according to the node in which the SM is going to be deployed.
    However, it is worth noting that not all TEEs provide the same features: for example,
    Intel SGX supports data sealing, whereas Sancus does not support persistent storage
    at all. In the connections section, the deployer declares connections between
    SMs. A connection links together two endpoints, each of them identified by the
    pair <SM_name,endpoint_name>. Moreover, each connection must indicate the authenticated
    encryption algorithm to use for protecting events in transit. Currently, both
    Intel SGX and TrustZone support aes-Galois-Counter Mode (GCM) and spongent (both
    with 128 bits of security), whereas Sancus only supports spongent. 4.5.2 Deploying
    a New Application. reactive-tools provides separate commands for the deployment
    and attestation of modules, as well as for the establishment of connections. To
    this end, the deployer would run the deploy, attest, and connect commands in sequence,
    each time providing as input the same deployment descriptor. If all these commands
    succeed, the deployment is complete and the application is ready to process events.
    4.5.3 Interfacing with the Application. At runtime, the deployer might want to
    interact with the application in a secure way, e.g., to initialize a web server
    or to get some metrics from a database. However, the CallEntry API provided by
    the event managers to call modules’ entry points is not secure, as for this kind
    of message the data is transmitted unencrypted over the network. Hence, the deployer
    would need to manually implement encryption and/or authentication mechanisms for
    data exchanged with the application. Nevertheless, to facilitate the secure communication
    between a deployer and their SMs, our framework provides a convenient feature
    called direct connections. Unlike normal connections between two modules, a direct
    connection uses the deployer’s machine as source endpoint. Since connection keys
    are generated and distributed at deployment time by our script, it is possible
    to also use such keys to generate output (or request) events and send them directly
    to running modules. These connections can be defined in the deployment descriptor
    together with the others, and are characterized by the additional direct:true
    field. The deployer can then either generate new events manually or automatically
    using reactive-tools; either way, the receiving module processes these events
    just as any other event. Since the deployer’s machine is assumed to be trusted,
    the same security guarantees as normal connections apply for direct connections
    as well. 4.6 Attestation and Key Management To ease the attestation of modules
    and the storage of encryption keys, we developed an optional component called
    the Attestation Manager. It consists of an Intel SGX enclave that is deployed
    on the infrastructure together with the applications, and to which the deployer
    and reactive-tools can send requests through a dedicated command-line interface.
    When the attestation manager is deployed, it first needs to be attested using
    the usual Intel SGX attestation process. Similarly to the attestation of SMs,
    a shared secret is exchanged between the challenger (i.e., the deployer) and the
    enclave, which is then used to establish a secure channel. After the initialization
    is complete, the attestation manager is ready to receive Attest requests from
    the deployer; the attestation manager then takes care of executing the actual
    attestation logic, based on the TEE technology used by the module. If the attestation
    succeeds, the attestation manager stores the module key securely in the enclave
    memory, and it can be fetched (or used indirectly) by the deployer at any time.
    4.6.1 Advanced Usages. The attestation manager, when used, may enable additional
    use cases. Below, we shortly describe some of them. Note that we only aim at providing
    an informal and high-level outline of such use cases, to motivate the usage of
    a centralized attestation/key management component. As such, we will not go into
    details on the design nor perform a security analysis. — Key management. The simplest
    use case is to merely store credentials (i.e., module and connection keys), which
    can be accessed by the deployer or any other authorized entities when needed.
    Credentials can be stored in enclave memory or persisted in storage using sealing
    capabilities of TEEs such as Intel SGX. Note that the latter case may introduce
    vulnerabilities against rollback attacks [3]. — Distributed confidential computing.
    Certain applications process privacy-sensitive information, such as health-related
    data. TEEs already protect against honest-but-curious infrastructure providers,
    while attestation ensures the authenticity of application code and proves that
    the isolation mechanisms of a TEE are correctly in place. However, in some cases,
    it may be desirable to conceal sensitive data even from the deployer, who normally
    has access to connection keys and could potentially decrypt data in transit between
    modules. Therefore, the attestation manager could be used to generate and distribute
    connection keys to modules without the deployer learning any information about
    their value. — Root of Trust in edge devices. In some edge scenarios such as automotive/Vehicle-to-Everything
    (V2X), nodes may be part of a local network that does not have continuous access
    to Internet services. In such cases, it might be useful to deploy an attestation
    manager on the network responsible for the initialization and attestation of local
    enclaves. For instance, we could envision a TrustZone gateway in a car that initializes
    all Sancus’ Electronic Control Units (ECUs) when the engine is turned on, refusing
    to start the car if any of the attestations fails [65]. In this scenario, the
    gateway acts as the root of trust of the system, and its remote attestation would
    be possible as soon as the system comes back online. Skip 5EVALUATION Section
    5 EVALUATION To evaluate our framework, we developed a prototype for a Smart Home
    application that combines together Intel SGX, ARM TrustZone, and Sancus. In this
    chapter, we introduce our Smart Home environment and motivate security requirements
    (Section 5.1); then, we describe the hardware and software setup of our evaluation
    (Section 5.2). After that, we provide a detailed performance analysis of our application
    (Section 5.3), and finally discuss TCB size and development effort (Section 5.4).
    5.1 Smart Homes A smart home is a residential property integrated with technology
    to remotely control appliances and systems, such as lighting, heating and cooling,
    and entertainment. The adoption of smart home devices has increased rapidly, with
    an estimated 250 million smart homes worldwide in 2021, expected to reach 350
    million by 2023.6 Despite the benefits such as enhanced comfort and energy efficiency,
    security concerns arise from inadequate security measures in many smart home devices.
    Studies like [16] have shown that many vulnerabilities come from poor authentication,
    missing encryption, insecure software updates, and insufficient access control,
    leading to potential privacy violations and unauthorized access to personal information
    and control of home devices. Thus, our framework can be utilized in the context
    of smart homes to provide robust security guarantees. Through the use of TEEs,
    both code and data are protected in use, and attestation ensures code integrity.
    Additionally, our deployment approach supports secure software updates and guarantees
    that all connections are encrypted and mutually authenticated. This eliminates
    a broad range of attacks while minimizing the development and deployment effort.
    5.2 Testing Environment To evaluate our framework, we developed a prototype for
    a small smart home application consisting of three simulated IoT devices: a temperature
    sensor, a smart thermostat, and a light switch. A smart home gateway, similar
    to existing projects such as Home Assistant,7 manages the IoT devices and enforces
    some custom-defined logic, e.g., to automatically turn on or off the heating if
    the temperature goes below or above predefined thresholds. Furthermore, a web
    application is made available to local and remote users, to monitor the house
    and perform some operations on demand, e.g., to switch the lights on or off. Both
    smart thermostat and light switch are connected via Secure I/O to an LED, indicating
    whether heating and lights are on or off at a certain time. The source code of
    our prototype is publicly available on Github.8 We implemented an application
    such as described above using five SMs: — web: Exposes a web application to allow
    external users to interact with the smart home; — gateway: Manages all the IoT
    devices and enforces a user-defined logic, while at the same time interacting
    with web to send status data and receive commands from external users; — temp_sensor:
    Simulates a sensor that provides the current temperature in the house; — thermostat:
    Simulates a smart thermostat, to enable or disable the heating system; — light_switch:
    Simulates a smart light switch, to enable or disable the lights. As depicted in
    Figure 13, we deployed our smart home application as follows: Fig. 13. Fig. 13.
    Setup of our smart home application. Each SM is deployed on a different node,
    either running Intel SGX, TrustZone, or Sancus. All communication between modules
    is encrypted and authenticated by our framework, while the communication between
    web and users relies on HTTPS and mutually authenticated. Sancus nodes are connected
    via UART to a passive bridge, which converts between UART streams and TCP/IP.
    — web as an Intel SGX SM, on an Intel NUC7i3BNHXF with Intel Core i3-7100U; —
    gateway as a TrustZone SM, on a BD-SL-i.MX6 board with ARM Cortex-A9 running at
    1GHz; — temp_sensor, thermostat and light_switch as Sancus SMs, on three different
    16-bit OpenMSP430 microcontrollers running at 8 MHz. In our setup, all nodes communicate
    over TCP/IP in the same local network; However, multiple deployment strategies
    may be adopted, e.g., deploying web in a public cloud. Since our Sancus microcontrollers
    can only communicate through UART, we wrote a Python script that acts as a passive
    bridge, converting UART streams to TCP/IP packets and vice versa without being
    able to decrypt or manipulate the content of events. All communication is end-to-end
    protected from the user to the IoT devices. As shown in the figure, communication
    between SMs is carried over encrypted and authenticated events, leveraging our
    framework (Section 3). Instead, the communication channel between web and the
    user is encrypted using HTTPS. User and web mutually authenticate each other:
    web is authenticated by the user during the TLS handshake, during which web presents
    an ephemeral X.509 certificate generated after successful attestation; the user,
    instead, authenticates by providing a secret token, similarly to session cookies
    or JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). 5.3 Performance Benchmarks We analyzed the performance
    of the Smart Home application introduced above. Cryptographic overhead was assessed
    per node and an end-to-end evaluation was conducted by measuring the round-trip
    time of an event sent from web to light_switch and return. The impact of a module
    update was evaluated by measuring application downtime during the update. 5.3.1
    Cryptographic Operations. Figure 14 shows the average time calculated on each
    TEEs to perform crypto operations using either aes-gcm or spongent as authenticated
    encryption library, with 128 bits of security. We used different sizes for the
    data to encrypt, ranging from 8 to 4096 bytes. To provide a reference, we also
    carried out the same experiments on a simple Linux x86 process without TEE protection,
    running on the Intel SGX node, whose results are depicted in the third column
    (Native x86). The plots show average timings computed over 110 iterations, except
    that Sancus values have been extrapolated from previous experiments [52]. Fig.

    on different TEEs. As a reference, we also measured the average time spent on
    a Linux x86 process without TEE protection (i.e., the Native x86 line). All measurements
    are in milliseconds. Modern x86 and ARM processors include aes instructions in
    their instruction set, allowing them to perform cryptographic operations in hardware
    for improved performance and security. As shown in Figure 14(a), a single aes
    encryption is extremely fast natively, taking around 878 μs to encrypt 4,096 bytes
    of data. The overhead caused by the enclaved execution in Intel SGX significantly
    slows down the execution of these functions with a factor that increases linearly
    with the size of the data: encrypting 4,096 bytes takes up to 31 times more than
    natively. Regarding TrustZone, instead, it can be observed from Figure 14(a) that
    the payload size had little impact on the encryption time, with values between
    30 and 31 ms and a standard deviation of 0.3 ms. We noticed that TrustZone has
    a fixed overhead due to some system calls that need to be called to initialize
    each cryptographic operation. In our case, the TA has to call TEE_ResetOperation,
    TEE_AEInit and TEE_AEUpdateAAD.9 Instead, we could not provide any data for Sancus,
    as it does not include an aes module in its architecture. The lack of an aes engine
    in Sancus is a serious issue for our framework, as it prevents Sancus modules
    to communicate securely with modules of other TEEs and the deployer. To circumvent
    this problem, a software implementation of the spongent crypto library was implemented
    in previous work, in both C/C++ and Rust. Thus, both Intel SGX and TrustZone modules
    can leverage such library to exchange protected events with Sancus modules. However,
    the overhead for performing such operations in software is significant: as shown
    in Figure 14(b), while for small amount of data the difference is less prominent,
    the performance heavily degrades for bigger data. Compared to aes and for payloads
    ranging between 8 and 4,096 bytes, spongent is up to 3,026 times slower on native
    x86, up to 99 times slower in Intel SGX, and up to 395 times slower in TrustZone.
    Instead, experiments show that spongent is significantly faster in hardware.10
    Unfortunately, this poor performance may completely compromise the real-time requirements
    of certain use cases, and replacing spongent with aes might be appropriate, depending
    on the acceptable processing time and power consumption on Sancus nodes for a
    specific use case. 5.3.2 End-to-end Measurements and RTT. We performed end-to-end
    experiments on our Smart Home application to measure execution times and round-trip
    time (RTT). In particular, we evaluated the scenario where an external user manually
    enables the lights by sending an HTTP request to web. This event triggers the
    following flow: (1) web sends an event to gateway containing 2 bytes of payload
    that encodes the desired action (i.e., enable the lights); (2) gateway decrypts
    the event and generates a new one for light_switch, using the same payload; (3)
    light_switch receives and decrypts the event, then dispatches an internal event
    to turn the LED on. After that, it sends an event back to gateway as a notification
    that the lights have been turned on, using the same 2 bytes of payload as before;
    (4) gateway receives the event and updates its internal state. Then, it generates
    an event for web containing the current status of the smart home in JSON format,
    whose size is 97 bytes; (5) Finally, web receives the updated status. Starting
    from this moment, the user will be able to see in the web application that the
    lights have been successfully turned on. Figure 15 shows the sequence diagram
    of the flow just described. Time was recorded to measure the performance impact
    of the most important steps: encryptions/decryptions, host-enclave boundary crosses,
    Secure I/O, and transmission times. We also measured the end-to-end round-trip
    time (RTT), consisting of the difference in time between the start and end points
    in web. The sequence diagram shows average timings over 110 iterations. The average
    RTT was 432.62 milliseconds, which includes 8 encryptions/decryptions (4 using
    aes and 4 using spongent), 8 host-enclave boundary crosses, and 4 network transmissions
    between nodes. To better understand the performance impact of each operation,
    timing values have been aggregated and shown in Table 2. Fig. 15. Fig. 15. Sequence

    Figure 13. The diagram illustrates a scenario where the user manually switches

    Aggregating the Average Time Spent for Performing Specific Tasks The last row
    shows the round-trip time (RTT), which consists of the sum of all the intermediate
    times. In the third column, we show the impact of each task on the RTT. Around
    64% of the RTT was spent on encrypting/decrypting events: On the one hand, cryptographic
    operations performed in hardware were generally fast, taking a total of 67.03
    ms for aes and 336 μ s for spongent. The former, however, was heavily affected
    by the fixed TrustZone overhead for initializing cryptographic operations (Section
    5.3.1), which may be optimized in future releases of OP-TEE. On the other hand,
    spongent operations performed in software caused huge performance penalties on
    the application, taking a total of 208.62 ms ( ∼ 48.2% of the RTT). Crossing the
    boundary between host and enclave accounted for the 16.83% of the RTT (72.81 ms);
    in particular, we observed that the slowest transitions between untrusted and
    trusted domains were registered in the TrustZone node, with an average of 17 ms
    for each transition. Domain transitions in Sancus proved to be extremely fast,
    each of them requiring only around 250 μ s. In Intel SGX, instead, it took roughly
    2.2 ms to enter/exit the enclave. Poor network performance in Sancus had a non-negligible
    impact on our measurements. In fact, the average total transmission time was 31.40
    ms, 91% of which spent on the transmission of events to and from Sancus microcontrollers.
    As described in Section 5.2, this is due to the low baud rate (57,600 bps) of
    the UART interface and the overhead caused by the passive device used to communicate
    with the Sancus microcontrollers. From our experiments, we observed that the Secure
    I/O overhead was on average 12.35 ms which, according to Section 4.1.5, includes:
    (1) sending an event from light_switch to the LED driver module (mod-driver);
    (2) sending an event from the LED driver module to the LED MMIO module (mod-mmio);
    (3) executing the logic to enable the LED. We did not measure such steps independently
    in this evaluation, since the main objective of our evaluation was to assess and
    evaluate the inter-operation between different TEEs and measure the communication
    overhead across different implementations. However, we extensively evaluated Sancus
    in our previous work [51]. Finally, an average of 40.07 ms ( ∼ 9.26% of the RTT)
    was due to other application logic that was not measured during the experiments.
    In the sequence diagram, this consists of the grey rectangles minus the time spent
    for performing cryptographic operations and Secure I/O. For example, this logic
    includes the time spent for the look up of a Connection structure given a specific
    connection ID, or for finding the correct SM to which deliver an event. The performance
    of such operations is implementation-specific, and may be improved by using more
    efficient logic and data structures. In summary, our experiments demonstrate that
    the overhead of our framework does not affect user experience for near real-time
    applications such as Smart Home. Considering our setup, after sending out a command,
    the user receives a feedback in less than 500 milliseconds. Our micro-benchmarks
    also show that the RTT can be further improved by adopting different deployment
    strategies, e.g., by merging web and gateway together in a single SM. For real-time
    applications, however, this may not be sufficient and additional capabilities
    might be needed, such as hardware acceleration for all cryptographic operations.
    We also note that all experiments were performed on a prototype that is not fully
    optimized, and all modules were built in debug mode; Thus, we expect that the
    overall performance would improve in a production environment. 5.3.3 Module Update.
    Real-world applications require changes at runtime, e.g., software updates or
    module migration from one node to another. This process impacts on the availability
    of the whole application, because updating the application unavoidably results
    in a temporary loss of connectivity. Therefore, we evaluated the overhead of a
    software update in our framework, for all our supported TEEs. Again, we carried
    out our experiments on the Smart Home application (Figure 13); results are shown
    in Table 3, each value representing the average over 10 iterations. Table 3. Module
    TEE Build Deploy Attest Connect Total web Intel SGX 1.199 0.247 1.794 0.775 4.027
    temp_sensor Sancus 0.443 2.510 2.576 0.251 5.833 gateway TrustZone 0.976 0.438
    0.329 1.277 3.063 Table 3. Average Time to Perform a Software Update on Different
    TEEs, All Measurements are in Seconds We carried out the experiments on the Smart
    Home application, using the same setup described in Figure 13. Build, deployment,
    and attestation times are highly application-specific; in our case, all modules
    were re-deployed without code changes and no state transfer between old and new
    instances was implemented. In our experiments, we re-deployed the original SMs
    without any code changes. As shown in Table 3, the build time was rather small
    for all TEEs, ranging from nearly 450 ms for Sancus to around 1.2 seconds for
    Intel SGX. However, building times highly depend on the amount of changes made
    to the original code, and whether the compiler’s cache was used or not. Hence,
    these measurements are not really interesting because highly variable. Similarly,
    deploying the new SM on the infrastructure depends on the size of the SM itself
    and the bandwidth of the communication medium. The table shows that the deployment
    of a Sancus module is a slow process, taking an average of 2.510 seconds; this
    can be explained by the slow communication channel between the Sancus node and
    the deployer, as explained in Section 5.3.2. The deployment process for Intel
    SGX and TrustZone takes only 247 ms and 438 ms, respectively; Binary sizes are
    shown in Table 4. Table 4. Table 4. Size (“Src”: Source Code, “Bin”: Binary Size)
    of the Software for Running the Evaluation Scenario Our experiments show that
    the attestation time greatly varies according to the TEE used. Attesting an Intel
    SGX enclave took an average of 1.794 s; in fact, the modified sigma protocol used
    in our framework consists of several steps, including the involvement of the Intel
    Attestation Server (IAS) to decrypt the quote (Section 4.2.4). For TrustZone,
    instead, we use a simple challenge-response protocol, as described in Section
    4.3.4. Thus, attesting a TrustZone module is very fast and takes an average of
    329 ms. Sancus uses a similar mechanism, though its attestation takes much longer,
    i.e., 2.576 s on average. However, we observed that the majority of this time
    was actually spent on the deployer’s side to compute the module key from the module’s
    binary; the actual challenge-response protocol only took less than 100 milliseconds.
    Finally, after the new module is ready (i.e., deployed and attested), all connections
    need to be redirected from the old to the new instance. Following the update strategy
    illustrated in Section 3.7, this is the time in which the application would suffer
    from temporary connectivity loss. However, our experiments show that this process
    only takes a very short amount of time, ranging from 251 ms for Sancus to 1277
    ms for TrustZone. It has to be noted, though, that these values only represent
    the time to deliver all the events to the SMs and event managers (SetKey and AddConnection
    events, respectively), and do not include the processing time in the nodes. Hence,
    the effective time would be a bit higher. Besides, this time is linearly dependent
    on the number of connections to re-establish; in our case, we had five connections
    for web, nine for gateway, and two for temp_sensor. In conclusion, the overall
    time for a software update is highly variable and application-dependent. Nevertheless,
    the connectivity loss is only perceived during the Connect phase, which roughly
    takes around 150 milliseconds for each connection to re-establish. 5.4 Adapting
    Burden We performed a code evaluation of our Smart Home application, results of
    which are shown in Table 4. Our analysis focuses on two main aspects: first, the
    TCB size in relation to the whole software stack; second, an estimation of the
    developer’s effort. Concerning the TCB, we calculated both lines of code and binary
    sizes, while for the developer’s effort we only focused on the code. We note that
    application modules were built in debug mode, which may have caused slightly bigger
    binaries. One of the most important benefits of process-based TEEs is a substantial
    reduction of the TCB, leading to a considerably reduced attack surface on each
    node. Table 4 shows that the reduction in Sancus is 92.9% in lines of code (LOCs)
    and 56.4% in binary size, while on SGX this reduction is more prominent with 99.9%
    reduction in code and 98.7% in binary size. Interestingly, TrustZone achieves
    a 99.9% reduction in both, which means that OP-TEE is only a thin software layer
    compared to a classic operating system. It has to be noted that the code reduction
    in SGX and TrustZone is enhanced by the fact that our reference host OS (Debian
    11) consists of more than 700 million C/C++ lines of codes (LOCss), and more than
    one billion LOCss overall [17]. Our framework strives to simplify the development
    of distributed enclave applications. As shown in Sections 3 and 4, our API allows
    a developer to only specify the core logic of a software module, while the rest
    of the code is added at compile time by the framework. Our evaluation of the developer’s
    effort consists of the ratio between the LOCss written by the developer and the
    total LOCss of a module, including stub code but excluding third-party libraries.
    Results show that the amount of code written by the developer is minimal: only
    4.9% for Sancus, 9.8% for SGX, and 6.6% for TrustZone. However, these numbers
    may greatly vary: our evaluation was carried on a simple prototype with a few
    modules; More complex applications would require higher effort. The above evaluation
    can only provide rough estimates of the benefits of our framework: Performing
    a precise code evaluation is not a trivial task. Kernels and operating systems
    typically make extensive use of conditional compilation to enable/disable specific
    features or to target different hardware architectures. Thus, even though an operating
    system may have millions or more LOCss, most of them are not used during compilation.
    Besides, the number of LOCss is often magnified by auxiliary files such as build
    scripts, Makefiles, and so on. It is debatable whether these files should be included
    in the calculation or not: they are not part of the core logic of a software,
    but they can nevertheless introduce vulnerabilities at compile time. Applications,
    instead, may include several third-party libraries which size might not be easy
    to calculate: examples are closed-source and dynamic libraries. Finally, our evaluation
    did not consider software components such as bootloaders, firmware/BIOS, hypervisors,
    compilers, standard libraries, and so on. While some of these are untrusted, others
    are part of the TCB and must be taken into account for a complete evaluation.
    Skip 6DISCUSSION Section 6 DISCUSSION 6.1 Integrity versus Confidentiality We
    have focused our security objective on integrity and authenticity, and an interesting
    question is to what extent we can also provide confidentiality guarantees. It
    is clear that, thanks to the isolation properties of protected modules and to
    the confidentiality properties of authenticated encryption, our prototype already
    provides substantial protection of the confidentiality of both the state of the
    application as well as the information contained in events. However, providing
    a formal statement of the confidentiality guarantees offered by our approach is
    non-trivial: some information leaks to the attacker, such as for instance when
    (and how often) modules send events to each other. This in turn can leak information
    about the internal state of modules or about the content of events. The ultimate
    goal would be to make compilation and deployment fully abstract [1] (indicating
    roughly that the compiled system leaks no more information than can be understood
    from the source code), but our current approach is clearly not fully abstract
    yet. Hence, we decided to focus on strong integrity first, and leave confidentiality
    guarantees for future work. There is also a wealth of orthogonal research aiming
    at protecting network information flows from being used by attackers to learn
    the system state by means of, e.g., covert channels or routing protocols for mix
    networks (cf. [60] for an overview). The applicability of these approaches depends
    on application configuration and available system resources and may heavily impact
    availability guarantees. On light-weight TEEs such as Sancus, and specifically
    in the presence of constraints on system resources and power consumption, these
    additional protections are not applicable. 6.2 Availability Our authentic execution
    framework focuses on the notion that if a valid input to a module is received,
    we can deduce that it must have originated from an authentic event at the source.
    By definition, this notion does not give any availability guarantees: only if
    we receive such a valid input can we make claims about the authentic event, whereas
    nothing can be claimed otherwise. However, there has been recent work on enforcing
    availability guarantees for TEEs, specifically for Sancus [4]. At its core, this
    related work enables strict availability guarantees to enclaves on Sancus, such
    as that an enclave will be executed periodically or be enabled to serve an interrupt
    within a predictable time frame. This allows to make claims about how specific
    enclaves will behave and when these enclaves will react upon events they receive.
    At the same time, it is still not possible to make any availability claims about
    events that exceed the device boundary, i.e., events that cross beyond the device
    itself and that are communicated over a shared untrusted medium such as a network.
    Overall, it may be possible to make strong claims about when and how fast a received
    event will be processed by an enclave, but it is not possible to guarantee that
    an event will necessarily arrive over the untrusted network. Thus, we see availability
    as a complementary guarantee for authentic execution: If an event arrives at the
    device boundary, earlier work such as Aion [4] can guarantee that this event can
    be handled within a strict time frame, depending on the scenario’s needs. Furthermore,
    the same work can guarantee that if no event is received within the expected time,
    the enclave will also be able to react within a guaranteed time window. This may
    be useful for a specific set of scenarios where disrupted availability could lead
    to unwanted or dangerous outcomes. By employing availability as a safeguard, the
    absence of events could, e.g., be used to trigger mode change and activate a local
    control loop to emergency-shutoff equipment until an authentic event is received.
    While we do believe that this complementary notion of availability can have a
    benefit to certain scenarios that utilize authentic execution, we leave the combination
    of these two orthogonal research directions for future work. 6.3 Hardware Attacks
    and Side-Channels Although hardware attacks and side-channels are explicitly ruled
    out by our attacker model (Section 2.3), it is necessary to discuss the impact
    in case an attacker would have given access to such techniques. We leave an analysis
    of our implementation for side-channels for future work. An attacker that successfully
    circumvents the hardware protections on a node would be able to manipulate and
    impersonate all modules running on that node. That is, the attacker would be able
    to inject events into an application but only for those connections that originate
    from the compromised node. The impact on the application obviously depends on
    the kind of modules that run on the node. If it is an output module, the application
    is completely compromised since the attacker can now produce any output they want.
    If, on the other hand, it is one among many sensor nodes, that get aggregated
    on another node, the impact may be minor. Depending on the node type different
    attack vectors apply. A wealth of literature targets Intel processors and SGX
    enclaves [11, 24, 64, 67, 70] that enable the extraction of cryptographic keys
    or other application secrets. On embedded TEE processors such as Sancus, many
    side-channels such as cache timing attacks [25, 40] or page fault channels [75]
    are not applicable. Interrupt-based side channels [66] do pose a challenge and
    have been mitigated in orthogonal research in hardware [12] and in software [71].
    Skip 7RELATED WORK Section 7 RELATED WORK 7.1 TEE Frameworks In recent years,
    TEEs have gained more and more popularity in both research and industry, due to
    their properties and the security guarantees they provide. However, developing
    TEE applications is not trivial as software developers are normally required to
    have some expertise in the field; moreover, more and more TEEs are emerging nowadays,
    which makes it more difficult to write heterogeneous applications or simply to
    port an application from one TEE to another. To this end, Keystone [32] is an
    open-source framework for building customized TEEs; it provides generic primitives
    such as isolation and attestation, and hardware manufacturers and programmers
    can tailor the TEE design based on what they actually need. More software-based
    frameworks such as OpenEnclave [54] and Google Asylo [23] aim at providing a general
    API for writing enclave applications, allowing developers to write code that is
    not tied to a specific TEE and can therefore be easily ported to multiple platforms.
    Our framework uses a different approach, which consists of abstracting the TEE
    layer away from developers in order to write enclave applications just like normal
    ones. Other projects such as Enarx [20], follow the same principles as ours, although
    they mainly focus on high-end TEEs such as Intel SGX, TDX, and AMD SEV. To the
    best of our knowledge, our framework is the only one that support heterogeneous
    architectures, combining high-end systems, IoT devices, and small embedded microcontrollers.
    Process-based TEEs such as Intel SGX strive in minimizing the TCB, as only the
    critical part of an application can be moved to the enclave. However, this comes
    with significant performance penalties, especially when crossing the boundary
    between the enclave and the untrusted domain. Instead, VM-based TEEs such as AMD
    SEV [30], Intel TDX [26], and ARM CCA [36] are substantially better in terms of
    performance, but have a much bigger attack surface as the entire virtual machine
    is part of the TCB. As future work, we might investigate the use of VM-based TEEs
    combined with lightweight operating systems such as the formally-verified seL4
    microkernel [31]. 7.2 Mutually Authenticated Enclaves At deployment time, our
    framework leverages symmetric connection keys to establish secure and mutually-authenticated
    channels between modules. Modules do not need to explicitly attest each other,
    but rather they rely on the fact that connection keys are securely distributed
    to modules only after successful attestation. The implicit assumption here is
    that such keys are known only by the modules and their deployer, and are always
    kept in secure memory and transmitted over encrypted channels. A similar idea
    was applied to the automotive scenario by creating a mesh of mutually-authenticated
    Sancus enclaves to provide integrity and authenticity of CAN messages exchanged
    between the ECUs of a vehicle [65]. In Reference [76], multiple Intel SGX enclaves
    of an application establish mutual trust during the initialization of TLS sessions,
    using certificates previously generated by central servers upon successful attestation.
    Marblerun [42] uses the same principle to create a service mesh between enclaves
    in a Kubernetes cluster. Our framework, instead, relies on symmetric encryption
    for the establishment of secure channels, as public-key cryptography is not supported
    on small microcontrollers like Sancus. Although asymmetric encryption and client
    certificates seem a better choice in terms of key management and authentication,
    we decided to leverage symmetric connection keys even on Intel SGX and TrustZone
    in order to allow communication with Sancus modules. 7.3 Secure I/O There are
    several intensive previous solutions aiming at providing a trusted path between
    an authorized trusted application and I/O devices that guarantees the integrity
    and authenticity of I/O data. McCune et al. [44] have proposed a BitE framework
    that leverages a trusted mobile device to establish an encrypted and authenticated
    input channel between I/O devices and an application running on a TPM-equipped
    untrusted platform. However, data inside the host platform is not isolated, hence
    the OS kernel must be part of the TCB. Bumpy [45], a succeeding work from the
    same research group, addresses this limitation by relying on the Flicker TEE [43]
    and using the encryption-capable keyboard to provide a safe pathway from input
    devices through untrusted environments. Bumpy uses dedicated hardware and hence
    cannot generalize to arbitrary I/O devices. Our approach to trusted I/O improves
    over Bumpy by greatly reducing the size of the software TCB, from a full OS to
    less than 1 kLOC. By using Sancus as a TEE, we enable the integration of attestable
    software and I/O encryption directly into the input device. When communicating
    with a host that interacts with Sancus nodes, technologies such as Flicker, TrustZone
    or Intel SGX can be used to protect host services and to further reduce the TCB.
    Several studies investigated a hypervisor-based approach. The techniques offered
    by Zhou et al. [78, 79] aim at establishing a trusted path between an input peripheral
    and an application using a hypervisor to run the untrusted OS and application
    endpoints providing the necessary device drivers in separate VMs. DriverGuard
    [13] is a hypervisor-based mechanism that leverages a combination of cryptographic
    and virtualization techniques to protect I/O device control, I/O data flows against
    attacks from a malicious guest kernel. These systems rely on hardware interfaces,
    peripherals, and the USB bus to behave according to specification. Rogue devices
    on the USB bus, e.g., hardware keyloggers, can intercept messages between an I/O
    device and the host. Although our design focuses on integrity guarantees, our
    prototype protects communication channels using authenticated encryption. A more
    recent work, SGXIO [69], provides support for generic, trusted I/O paths for enclaves
    in Intel SGX by a composite of TPM, Intel SGX, and hypervisor techniques. Thus,
    SGXIO introduces a formally verified hypervisor (seL4 is recommended) to establish
    a trusted path while Intel SGX is in charge of protecting user applications from
    an untrusted OS. This approach improves upon existing generic trusted paths for
    x86 systems using Intel SGX’s easy programming model. Similarly, Aurora [37] utilizes
    a hypervisor running in the Secure Management Mode (SMM) of Intel x86 processors
    as well drivers in the Driver eXecution Environment of open-source UEFI firmware
    to implement a concept not unlike the protected driver modules from our work.
    A TPM is used to store Intel Boot Guard measurements of the firmware and hypervisor,
    enabling mutual attestation between the SMM side and application modules in SGX
    enclaves. Omitting a hypervisor layer, BASTION-SGX [55] introduces a trusted Bluetooth
    controller and application support to establish a trusted channel between SGX
    enclaves and Bluetooth devices. SGX-USB [72], instead, places a proxy device between
    the host and an I/O peripheral connected through USB, to establish a secure path
    to an Intel SGX enclave. Unlike the other SGX-based solutions, SGX-USB does not
    rely on software modifications or additional trusted hardware in the host platform.
    Fidelius [21] leverages only hardware settings with no reliance on hypervisor
    security assumptions to assist the establishment of a trusted path from input
    and output peripherals to a hardware enclave. More specifically, Fidelius utilizes
    a trusted dongle (e.g., Raspberry Pi) to protect the entire I/O path between the
    keyboard/screen and a small JavaScript interpreter that runs inside an Intel SGX
    enclave during web browsing sessions under a compromised OS and browser. The trusted
    dongle captures user input and sends a stream of encrypted keystrokes to an attested
    local enclave. Then, the web enclave decrypts and updates the state of the relevant
    trusted input field and eventually forwards it to the remote server. In the opposite
    direction, a series of encrypted overlays are sent from the enclave to the display.
    The trusted path between a dongle and the web enclave is established through pre-shared
    symmetric keys. Conversely, the web enclave and remote server attest to each other
    and establish a secure channel. Fidelius uses an LED indicator on each dongle
    and a status bar on the screen to ensure the establishment of the trusted paths;
    however, this leads to a high cognitive load on the users as they must monitor
    continuously different security indicators. Fidelius leverages a trusted external
    device to guarantee the integrity and authenticity of the transferred I/O data,
    while our solution for secure I/O relies only on the isolation and attestation
    properties in Sancus and does not suffer from micro-architectural attacks and
    relay attacks. ARM TrustZone provides isolated execution combined with generic
    trusted I/O paths. In TrustZone, different peripherals, including parts of RAM,
    IO devices, and interrupts, can be dynamically configured by a set of hardware
    controllers to be accessible only in the secure mode. This is achieved by the
    reflection of the NS bit into the respective peripheral. In contrast to Intel
    SGX, TrustZone assumes that all secure application processes are trusted and does
    not isolate them in hardware. However, several prior works take the advantage
    of TrustZone to establish a trusted I/O path with much focus on balancing the
    size of TCB against functionality. For example, TrustUI [35] builds trusted paths
    by splitting device drivers into an untrusted backend and a trusted front-end.
    The two parts communicate through shared memory by leveraging proxy modules running
    in both worlds. Similarly, TruZ-Droid [73] runs only half part of the HTTP and
    SSL protocols in the secure world to reduce the TCB size. VeriUI [39] proposes
    a login protection mechanism by moving all layers of the communication stack and
    UI library into TrustZone. TrustOTP [63] relies on tiny drivers running in the
    secure world to protect the one-time password display. Secure I/O in TrustZone
    is a well-researched topic that has got a great deal of attention in the past
    years. Apart from the projects described above, many others exist in the literature
    [33, 34, 74, 77]. More recently, a notion of trusted I/O was also implemented
    in Android smartphones to protect user transactions [15]. In our work, we did
    not implement a secure I/O solution for TrustZone, but rather we interfaced Sancus-enabled
    I/O devices with Intel SGX and TrustZone enclaves, providing exclusive and confidential
    access to isolated host drivers without trusting the underlying communication
    channels. Efforts have recently been made to enhance TEEs by incorporating hardware
    acceleration, particularly GPUs. This enables software modules to exclusively
    access external devices for computationally intensive tasks, such as machine learning
    model training. Several academic projects propose hardware extensions to GPUs
    to enable isolation and strict access control, including Graviton [68], HIX [28],
    and HETEE [80]. StrongBox [18] utilizes TrustZone extensions already present in
    ARM devices to provide a solution without requiring hardware changes. This trend
    has also influenced commercial products, such as NVIDIA’s new H100 Tensor Core
    GPU that supports confidential computing [53], and Intel TDX Connect, which offers
    extensions to the TDX architecture to securely assign I/O devices to trusted domains
    [27]. Our architecture can utilize hardware acceleration to enhance the use cases
    we are considering (Sections 2 and 5.1). For instance, it can be used to process
    sensor data for computing statistics or training machine learning models. Skip
    8Summary & Conclusions Section 8 Summary & Conclusions In this article, we present
    a software architecture to securely execute distributed applications on shared,
    heterogeneous TEE-infrastructures. We have extended Sancus, a light-weight embedded
    TEE with support for secure I/O, interfaced it with the commercial of-the-shelf
    TEEs ARM TrustZone and Intel SGX, and implemented and evaluated a software development
    framework, which enables the execution of reactive (event-driven) distributed
    applications on a shared infrastructure with strong authenticity guarantees and
    in the presence of capable attackers, while relying on a very small TCB. We have
    implemented (and foresee many more) compelling use cases in IoT and control systems.
    While much of our work is focused on small embedded microprocessors, we demonstrate
    that our solution to be generally applicable to, e.g., build secure distributed
    applications that integrate IoT sensing and actuation with cloud-based data processing
    or aggregation. Yet, implementing secure I/O is more challenging on non-embedded
    architectures. Extensions to our work would be to strengthen security guarantees
    while maintaining a small TCB, fully integrating a notion of availability based
    on [4], and to formalize the security argument using recently proposed logics
    (e.g., [8]) for reasoning about TEEs. APPENDIX Skip ALIST OF ASSUMPTIONS AND REQUIREMENTS
    Section A LIST OF ASSUMPTIONS AND REQUIREMENTS This work relies on a number of
    assumptions on hardware, software, and the environment. At the same time, we put
    specific requirements on the realization of concepts, entities, and mechanisms
    that we abstract from here, e.g., secure I/O, the infrastructure provider, and
    the deployment process. Below we list and justify these assumptions and requirements
    for easier reference. A.1 Assumptions Table A.1.1. Ref. Reproduction Comment 1
    The execution infrastructure offers specific security primitives – standard enclaves
    plus support for secure I/O. These hardware technologies are the base for authentic
    execution. 3.1 We assume the underlying architecture is a TEE. TEEs allow us to
    isolate source modules from other code running on a node and to minimize the TCB.
    3.1 The TEE provides an authenticated encryption primitive. This cryptographic
    scheme allows for integrity-protected and confidential communication between a
    module and other modules or the deployer. Show More Table A.1.1. Assumptions on
    Hardware Table A.1.2. Ref. Reproduction Comment 2.3 Attackers can manipulate all
    the software on the nodes, including OS, and can deploy their own applications
    on the infrastructure. We assume a strong attacker that can mess with all software
    except what is protected by the hardware, e.g., TEEs and driver modules. 2.3 Attackers
    can also control the communication network that nodes use to communicate with
    each other, can sniff the network, modify traffic, or mount man-in-the-middle
    attacks. With respect to the cryptographic capabilities of the attacker, we follow
    the Dolev-Yao model This is a common assumption for a network-based attacker or
    an attacker that has complete control over at least one of the networking stacks
    of a connection. 2.3 The attacker does not have physical access to the nodes.
    Otherwise this would allow, e.g., for physical side channel and bit faulting attacks,
    which are out of scope here. Show More Table A.1.2. Assumptions on Attacker Table
    A.1.3. Ref. Reproduction Comment 3.1 Both a module’s code and data are located
    in contiguous memory areas called, respectively, its code section and its data
    section. This is mainly a simplification to support TEEs that do not allow complex
    memory management, e.g., Sancus. 3.1 We assume a correct compiler. Without this
    assumption one could not deduce that the measured binaries of secure modules implement
    the expected source code functionality. Table A.1.3. Assumptions on Software Table
    A.1.4. Ref. Reproduction Comment 2.4 The deployer’s computing infrastructure is
    assumed to be trusted. While this can be alleviated by using TEEs, eventually
    a trusted system is needed to verify attestations on behalf of the deployer. 7.2
    Connection keys are known only by the modules and their deployer. Leaking Connection
    keys might allow an attacker to forge messages and bypass the authentic execution
    mechanism. 3.4 Driver modules are part of the trusted infrastructure As they take
    exclusive access of I/O devices to process physical inputs and outputs, they are
    controlled by the trusted infrastructure provider. Show More Table A.1.4. Assumptions
    on Infrastructure and Credentials A.2 Implementation Requirements Table A.2.1.
    Ref. Reproduction Comment IO1 The infrastructure provider configures the physical
    I/O devices as expected, i.e., that the desired peripherals are connected to the
    right pins and thus mapped to the correct Memory-Mapped I/O (MMIO) addresses in
    the node. If this was not the case, the inputs registered by the drivers would
    not correspond to the actual physical inputs, and vice versa for physical outputs.
    IO2 The infrastructure must provide a way for the deployer of M A to attest that
    it has exclusive access to the driver module M D and that M D also has exclusive
    access to its I/O device D. Without these attestation and exclusive access capabilities,
    it could not be guaranteed that inputs registered and outputs produced by the
    drivers are genuine. IO3 As soon as a microcontroller is turned on, driver modules
    take exclusive access to their I/O devices and never release it. This prevents
    an attacker from taking control of I/O devices before the infrastructure provider
    after a node reset. Show More Table A.2.1. Requirements on Secure I/O and Driver
    Modules Table A.2.2. Ref. Reproduction Comment D1 The channel between deployer
    and infrastructure provider is assumed to be secure. Without a secure channel
    between these entities, attackers could launch man in the middle attacks between
    drivers and the deployer’s secure modules. D2 Before granting such access, the
    infrastructure provider needs to ensure the authenticity of the driver module
    controlling the I/O device, e.g., via attestation As driver modules are part of
    the TCB, it has to be ensured that the correct, trusted driver module is running
    on the node where exclusive access to a device driver has been requested. D3 It
    is assumed that the provider does not leak the driver module keys and that exclusive
    access to a device is reserved for the deployer until they request to release
    it or an agreed-upon time T has passed. If the keys are leaked, an attacker may
    take control of said device driver at will. Releasing exclusive access prematurely
    is more of an availability problem as connection keys distributed to the driver
    module are never leaked, i.e., attackers could in that case take over a device
    driver but not insert themselves into a previous communication session with that
    driver. Show More Table A.2.2. Requirements on Infrastructure and Deployer Footnotes
    1 We implemented EPID for simplicity, though other attestation schemes could be
    supported as well. From a security perspective, all these schemes would provide
    similar guarantees. Footnote 2 https://github.com/ndokmai/rust-sgx-remote-attestation.

  data_sources: Real-time data from a smart water system deployment and in vitro experiments
  description: As a typical cyber-physical system (CPS), smart water distribution
    networks require monitoring of underground water pipes with high sample rates
    for precise data analysis and water network control. Due to poor underground wireless
    channel quality and long-range communication requirements, high transmission power
    is typically adopted to communicate high-speed sensor data streams, posing challenges
    for long-term sustainable monitoring. In this article, we develop the first sustainable
    water sensing system, exploiting energy harvesting opportunities from water flows.
    Our system does this by scheduling the transmission of a subset of the data streams,
    whereas other correlated streams are estimated using autoregressive models based
    on the sound-velocity propagation of pressure signals inside water networks. To
    compute the optimal scheduling policy, we formalize a stochastic optimization
    problem to maximize the estimation reliability while ensuring the system's sustainable
    operation under dynamic conditions. We develop data transmission scheduling (DTS),
    an asymptotically optimal scheme, and FAST-DTS, a lightweight online algorithm
    that can adapt to arbitrary energy and correlation dynamics. Using more than 170
    days of real data from our smart water system deployment and conducting in vitro
    experiments to our small-scale testbed, our evaluation demonstrates that Fast-DTS
    significantly outperforms three alternatives, considering data reliability, energy
    utilization, and sustainable operation.

  explanation: 'This research article titled, "Reliability or Sustainability: Optimal
    Data Stream Estimation and Scheduling in Smart Water Networks," explores the challenge
    of sensor data transmission in wireless water networks, where unreliable communication
    channels and long-range requirements result in high energy consumption for data
    transmission. To address this issue, the authors propose a novel sustainable water
    sensing system that leverages energy harvesting opportunities from water flows
    and employs a data transmission scheduling (DTS) scheme to optimize energy utilization
    while ensuring data reliability.'

    IEEE Conference Location: Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam SECTION I. Introduction The
    automatic irrigation system for the agricultural greenhouse is a system that performs
    the functions of collecting environmental data in the greenhouse and uses them
    to irrigate the crops automatically ensuring maximum water and energy savings.
    The system is usually organized into three levels including field level, control
    level and supervisor level. In recent years, there were many studies in this field.
    For instant, the Intelligent Greenhouse Environment Monitoring System introduced
    in [1], in which research has developed wireless sensor nodes to measure the environmental
    parameters used in control of irrigation, ventilation and lighting in the greenhouse.
    The system is based on ZigBee and embedded technology. It has the limitation that
    the use of medium access control (MAC) method called Pure Aloha reduces the reliability
    of the system especially in the case of large number of nodes in the network.
    A study on applications of wireless sensor network (WSN) for irrigation systems
    [2] has also been conducted. In this study, the authors created a system consisting
    of a central device connected to environmental data collection stations via ZigBee
    standard and developed an automatic irrigation algorithm. However, more irrigation
    algorithms should be developed instead of only one based on soil moisture. Moreover,
    the remote monitoring and control mode is only referred to as a development direction
    that has not yet been implemented in this study. Systems designed to fit the IoT
    trend are also a new research direction. The integrated system between Web Server,
    Ethernet and ZigBee technology specified in [3] is one of them. Although this
    is an advanced system however it is only designed to perform monitoring functions
    without control functions. One common finding in all of these studies is the use
    of ZigBee communication. The advantages of ZigBee such as low power consumption,
    high stability have explained for this. However, the limitation on transmission
    range is the main disadvantage of ZigBee technology (about 100 m), which becomes
    a major barrier when we need to expand the area of greenhouses. From the analysis
    above, we have researched and designed an automatic irrigation system for greenhouse
    crops to overcome the shortcomings of the above studies with a new approach. In
    this study, we have used the LoRa technology with outstanding advantages in transmission
    range and energy saving. In addition, in order to increase the stability of the
    system, we also propose to apply Master/Slave medium access control method for
    LoRa network. The irrigation modes are also more diversified and can be easily
    installed via Local User Interface or Web Interface. SECTION II. LORA TECHNOLOGY
    LoRa is a wireless communication standard that utilizes the Chirp Spread Spectrum
    (CSS) modulation technology. This technique has been used for a variety of military
    applications such as radar systems. LoRa is the world’s first commercially available
    wireless technology with low cost, long transmission range and optimal power consumption.
    The Table I below compares some parameters including transfer rate, transmission
    range, power consumption and cost between some popular wireless technologies.
    Accordingly, LoRa has shown its superiority in many aspects. Its only weakness
    is the data rate. However, in wireless sensor network applications, this is not
    an issue. TABLE I THE COMPARISON OF SOME WIRELESS TECNOLOGY [4] A. Characteristic
    Parameters of LoRa In LoRa technology, there are three main types of parameters
    to consider: Spreading Factor (SF): A tradeoff between data rate and range is
    provided by SF. Choice of higher spreading factor can increase the range but decreases
    the data rate and vice versa. Each symbol is spread by a spreading code of length
    2SF chips Coding Rate (CR): Define the number of bits added in the payload of
    the LoRa Packet that the receiver can use to detect and often to correct errors
    in the message, but it also decreases the effective data rate. Bandwidth (BW):
    LoRa provides three scaleable BW settings of 125 kHz, 250 kHz and 500 kHz. Transmitter
    sends the spread data at a chip rate equal to the system bandwidth in chips per-second-per-Hertz.
    So a LoRa bandwidth of 125 kHz corresponds to a chip rate of 125 kcps. SF, BW
    and CR are the basic and important parameters of the LoRa chipset. In that, SF
    and BW will affect the data rate and range while CR only affect the data rate.
    Depending on the specific application requirements for range, data rate we can
    choose the reasonable values to optimize the transmission. B. LoRa Packet Structure
    Fig. 1. LoRa Packet Structure Show All LoRa offers maximum packet size of 256
    bytes. The LoRa Packet (Fig. 1) is composed as follows: Preamble field: is transmitted
    first for the synchronization purposes of receiver with the incoming data flow.
    Header field: Depends on the selection of one of the two supported modes. In default
    Explicit Mode, the number of bytes in the header field specifies Forward Error
    Correction (FEC) code rate, payload length and presence of CRC in the frame. The
    second Implicit Mode specifies that coding rate and payload in a frame are fixed.
    In this mode, frame does not contains this field, which gives reduction in transmission
    time. Header field also contains 2 bytes CRC field which allows the receiver to
    discard packets with invalid header. Header field along with its CRC field are
    4 bytes long. Payload field: Contains application data transmitted through LoRa.
    Length of payload field varies from 2 to 255 bytes. CRC: Comprises 2 bytes of
    cyclic redundancy check (CRC) for error detection of payload field. This field
    is optional. C. Time on the Air of data packet For LoRa, the actual time on the
    air for a packet can be defined as [5]: T packet = T preamble + T payload (1)
    View Source In this formula, Tpreamble is transmission time of preamble field
    and Tpayload is transmission time of payload field. Tpreamble can be defined as:
    T preamble =( n preamble +4.25)× T sym (2) View Source Where npreamble is preamble
    length and Tsym defines the time required to transmit a symbol: T sym = 2 SF /BW
    (3) View Source with SF as Spreading Factor, BW as Bandwidth The payload transmission
    time is: T payload = n payload × T sym (4) View Source npayload is calculated
    as: { X=ceil[ (8PL−4SF+28+16CRC−20IH) 4(SF−2DE) ] n payload =8+max(X×(CR+4),0)
    View Source In the formula above: PL: number of bytes in payload field. IH: 0
    when the implicit header mode is used and 1 for vice versa. DE: 1 for enabled
    low data rate optimization and 0 for opposite case. CR: code rate (1 corresponds
    to CR = 4/5, 4 corresponds to CR = 4/8). So total time on the air Tpacket can
    be defined by using Equations 1, 2 and 4 T packet =( n preamble + n payload +4.25)×
    T sym (5) View Source SECTION III. LORA NETWORK CONSTRUCTION Fig. 2. Model of
    LoRa network referenced with OSI model Show All Fig. 3. Master/Slave network model
    Show All The LoRa network in this system was designed with star topology. Each
    of the devices in the network is structured in three layers according to the OSI
    model. Where the highest layer is the application layer. Under it, is the MAC
    layer (using master/slave medium access control method). The lowest layer is the
    physical layer (using LoRa modulation) Fig. 2. With this Master/Slave medium access
    control method, the Master station is responsible for allocating access to slaves
    (Fig. 3). Slaves are passive, so they only access the line and exchange the data
    when requested by Master. The Master Station either chose directly a slave to
    communicate with or uses polling method according to the purpose of access. The
    sequence diagram in Fig. 4 illustrates how polling method is implemented by Master.
    Fig. 4. Sequence diagram of master polling Show All The Master/Slave has the advantage
    of being simple and cost-effective because the Master Station is the only one
    that managing all network connections. With a well-designed Master Station, the
    reliability of the network will be guaranteed. The major disadvantage of this
    method is that the exchange of information between the Slave Stations (if any)
    is limited because the data must pass through the intermediate station also known
    as Master. However, in this design, field-level devices (Slaves) do not need to
    exchange information with each other, so the defect does not appear. SECTION IV.
    SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE The system architecture is designed as shown in Fig. 5. It
    includes a Concentrator, End Nodes, Local Database & User Interface and Web Server.
    Concentrator: Coordinates the operation of the network, receives data of environmental
    parameters from the Sensor Nodes and forwards this data to the Supervisor Computer
    and Web Server via Wi-Fi or GPRS/3G service. In addition, this device also functions
    to control the irrigation process according to the mode that the user has installed
    from the Computer Interface or Web Interface. In automatic irrigation mode, the
    data sent from Sensor Nodes is used as feedback to control the irrigation process.
    The Concentrator does not directly control the state of the valves, which is done
    through the Control Nodes located at field level. End Nodes: Includes Sensor Nodes
    and Control Nodes. In particular, the Sensor Nodes performs the measurement of
    air temperature, humidity and soil moisture, while the Control Nodes directly
    controls the actuators such as pumps and valves ordered by the Concentrator. Local
    Database & User Interface : This is where all data of the system is stored. User
    are also provided the option of monitoring, installing and managing system. Web
    Server & Web Interface: Is an online Server for storing data from measurement
    points. It not only provides tools for remote monitoring and control but also
    data analysis based on user requirements. Fig. 5. System Architecture Show All
    SECTION V. DESIGN A. Design of Concentrator Fig. 6. Concentrator block diagram
    Show All Fig. 7. Main program flowchart for Concentrator Show All As represented
    in Fig. 6. The main processing unit in the Concentrator is a 32-bit microcontroller
    (STM32F103RCT6) for powerful processing with clock speeds up to 72 MHz. The Concentrator
    is equipped with three types of wireless communication. While LoRa communication
    enables the Concentrator to connect to field-level devices, WiFi (ESP8266) and
    GPRS (SIM 800L) provide internet service for connecting the system to the Web
    Server. These blocks are handled by the central processing unit through UART standard.
    In order to increase the processing capacity and reduce the load on the central
    processing unit, the LoRa communication block is equipped with a particular microprocessor
    connected to the LoRa SX1278 modem via the SPI standard. Nearly every communication
    task in the LoRa network is processed by this microcontroller. Communication between
    the Concentrator and the Supervisor computer in case of configuration is performed
    by serial communication block (CH34G). The flowchart Fig. 7 describes the design
    of software for Concentrator. B. Design of Sensor Node Fig. 8. Sensor Node and
    Control Node block diagram Show All Fig. 9. Main program flowchart for Sensor
    Node Show All There are eight main blocks in the design of Sensor Node (Fig. 8a).
    The central processing unit in Sensor Node handles LoRa communications task and
    communicates with sensors as well as processes the data given by sensor, so the
    STM32F103 microcontroller is selected to meet the requirement of processing capacity.
    The LoRa modem (SX1278) is connected to the central processing unit via SPI. The
    temperature-humidity sensor (DHT11) is operated by the central processing unit
    via one-wire standard measuring from 0 to 50°C (±2 °C) for temperature and 20-90
    %RH (±5 %RH) for air humidity. The parameter of soil moisture is also given by
    a smart sensor that is linked to the central processing unit through 2-wire synchronization
    standard. Besides, the connection between Sensor Node and Computer for address
    configuration is provided by the serial communication block (CH340G). The configuration
    parameters for the device will be stored in the EPROM. Finally, the LEDs show
    the operating status of the device while the button is used to select either setting
    mode or running mode for the Sensor Node. The software’s algorithm for Sensor
    Nodes is pointed out in flowchart Fig. 9. C. Design of Control Node In the block
    diagram of Control Node Fig. 8b, the Control Node also includes a central processing
    unit (STM32F103), Lora communication block (SX1278), EPROM memory with the same
    function as the Sensor Node. Control the actuators such as valves and pumps is
    the main function of the Control Node performed directly by the Relay block. As
    an important part of Control Node, Feedback block provide information about the
    actual operating state of the actuators so that it allows for quick detection
    of unexpected problems. The software of Control Node device is designed as flowchart
    shown in Fig. 10. Fig. 10. Main program flowchart for Control Node Node Show All
    D. Design of Local DataBase & User Interface The Local User Interface (Fig. 11)
    is designed with main functions corresponding to 5 interfaces: Data monitoring
    interface: Display data and status of pumps and valves in the system. Control
    Interface: Allows setting of irrigation mode for each area. There are three modes
    of irrigation: Schedule mode, Automatic mode and Handle mode. Setting interface:
    Allows to add, remove farming area, set up the connection, enable the monitoring
    mode via Internet and chose the data sampling cycle. In addition, the interface
    provides advanced settings related to LoRa’s parameters such as address, frequency,
    spreading factor, coding rate, bandwidth to devices in the network. Reporting
    interface: Allows us to access the data and displays in the form of line chart
    and table. Data can also be extracted as Excel file. Crop management interface:
    Provide crop management functions, inquire crop information and propose appropriate
    crop. E. Web Server Intergration Currently, we have built-in Web Server (Fig.
    12) based on Ubiodot’s platform providing remote monitoring, control and data
    storage. Depending on the Internet connection technology selected is GPRS or WiFi
    we respectively use the HTTP method Get/Post or use the TCP/IP protocol to send
    and request data interactively to the Web Server. Fig. 11. Computer Interfaces
    Show All Fig. 12. Web interface based on Ubidots Platform Show All SECTION VI.
    TEST AND RESULT Fig. 13. The whole system Show All We have successfully designed
    a test system (Fig. 13) including 1 Concentrator, 2 Sensor Nodes, 2 Control Nodes,
    1 Local Database & User Interface and 1 Web Server (Ubidots). The tests were conducted
    on the campus of Hanoi University of Science and Technology. Accordingly, the
    End Devices are located about 350 meters from the Cordinator. The Control Nodes
    were connected to the pump (12VDC) and the valves to control the irrigation process
    for the areas where the soil moisture sensors of the Sensor Nodes are located.
    The experiments indicate that the system operate stably and meet the functions
    as designed. The irrigation modes also works correctly. The Fig. 14 and Fig. 15
    demonstrates the experimental process of automatic and scheduled irrigation during
    24 hours. Fig. 14. Automatic Irrigation Show All Fig. 15. Scheduled Irrigation
    Show All Fig. 16. The average transmission time of each message Show All Fig.
    17. Message rates must be re-transmitted at least one time Show All In order to
    evaluate the stability of the system using the Master/Slave medium access control
    method compared to the Pure Aloha method, we created the continuous transmission
    of 100 messages (16 bytes per messages) from End Devices to the Concentrator then
    assessed the rate of re-transmitted message and the average transmission time
    of each message. This test was individually conducted in 4 cases with 1, 2, 3
    and 4 End Devices connected in the network. Fig. 16 and Fig. 17 indicate that
    the higher of End Device, the higher average time needed to transmit a message,
    but the rate of re-transmitted message is always low and almost unchanged in case
    of Master/Slave method is used. For the Pure Aloha method, when the number of
    End Devices increases, the rate of re-transmitted messages rises dramatically
    causing the increase in average transmission time of each message. According to
    that trend, if the number of End Devices continues to increase the system may
    fail. In summary, it is clear that Master/Slave medium access control is more
    stable and reliable than Pure Aloha. SECTION VII. CONCLUSION The paper have presented
    the design of an automatic monitoring and control system for greenhouse agriculture
    including the overall structure of the system and the design in detail of each
    component including hardware and software design. In this study we used LoRa technology
    combined with the Master/Slave medium access control method to resolve the remaining
    issues of some previous studies such as range and reliability of wireless network,
    system functionality and irrigation modes are also made more diversified. Furthermore,
    the ability to control and monitor the system remotely via a Web Interface has
    also been integrated. Lastly, we have also provided some experimental results
    to support our study. With the results achieved, the system will be further studied
    to improve the stability and reliability of the system so that it can be put into
    practice in the near future. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics

  description: Smart cities are developed to optimize operations across the city such
    as waste and traffic management, water supply management, criminal tracking, and
    pollution monitoring, etc. Smart cities are formed by the interconnection of various
    Internet of Things (IoT) devices for collecting the data from objects and humans
    to perform necessary actions. But the challenge lies in the exchange of enormous
    information in real-time to drive smart city applications. Therefore, smart city
    applications make use of Device-to-Device (D2D) communications which provides
    higher bandwidth and lower latency in message exchanges. D2D communications do
    not need any infrastructure for communication and hence are cost and time effective.
    However, this advantage becomes a threat as no third party is involved to verify
    the authenticity of the devices before exchange of real information. Consequently,
    a reliable authentication mechanism is required to address the security issues
    in WiFi (wireless fidelity) Direct communication. In this paper, we propose a
    secure and lightweight mutual authentication and key agreement protocol for WiFi
    Direct. The principle of the protocol is based upon a commit/open pair and Diffie
    Hellman key exchange algorithm. It is observed from the simulations that the proposed
    protocol successfully authenticates the D2D devices in the WiFi Direct environment.
    Investigation through formal security analysis revealed the strong resistivity
    of the proposed protocol against the prominent attacks in the WiFi Direct environment.
    The comparative analysis demonstrates the reliability of the suggested protocol
    over the traditional one. The proposed protocol eliminates the occurrence of the

    Abstract Smart cities are developed to optimize operations across the city such
    as waste and traffic management, water supply management, criminal tracking, and
    pollution monitoring, etc. Smart cities are formed by the interconnection of various
    Internet of Things (IoT) devices for collecting the data from objects and humans
    to perform necessary actions. But the challenge lies in the exchange of enormous
    information in real-time to drive smart city applications. Therefore, smart city
    applications make use of Device-to-Device (D2D) communications which provides
    higher bandwidth and lower latency in message exchanges. D2D communications do
    not need any infrastructure for communication and hence are cost and time effective.
    However, this advantage becomes a threat as no third party is involved to verify
    the authenticity of the devices before exchange of real information. Consequently,
    a reliable authentication mechanism is required to address the security issues
    in WiFi (wireless fidelity) Direct communication. In this paper, we propose a
    secure and lightweight mutual authentication and key agreement protocol for WiFi
    Direct. The principle of the protocol is based upon a commit/open pair and Diffie
    Hellman key exchange algorithm. It is observed from the simulations that the proposed
    protocol successfully authenticates the D2D devices in the WiFi Direct environment.
    Investigation through formal security analysis revealed the strong resistivity
    of the proposed protocol against the prominent attacks in the WiFi Direct environment.
    The comparative analysis demonstrates the reliability of the suggested protocol
    over the traditional one. The proposed protocol eliminates the occurrence of the
    denial of service (DoS) and man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks in the discovery
    and key agreement phase, respectively. The proposed protocol can be easily integrated
    into the devices enabled with WiFi Direct and can offer a wide security package.

    smart when its existing infrastructure is combined with the technology to provide
    a better quality of life [1]. Fig. 1 illustrates the various smart city solutions.
    These solutions can be used for checking the parking space availability [2], weather
    adaptive operation of street lights [3], detection of trash levels in bins for
    optimized collection routes [4], making intelligent highways with warning messages
    according to the weather [5], [6], etc. The physical devices used in these systems
    can be integrated with electronic sensors, mobile devices, and information technology
    in order to provide real time decisive power [7]. Internet of Things (IoT) transforms
    the standalone objects to cyber–physical objects that lead to smarter cities [8].
    IoT provides real time access [9] and monitoring of information like warehouse
    stock details [10], patient health condition in hospital [11], fault intimation
    of machines [12], etc. Statistics indicate that by 2025, 75 billion IoT devices
    [13] will produce 79.4 zettabytes (ZB) of data [14], which is gigantic. Therefore,
    larger bandwidth for communication is required for catering to the requirements
    of IoT networks [15]. Moreover, any latency in the transfer of real time data
    can be catastrophic [16]. Given the above needs, the fifth-generation mobile networks
    (5G) are the most suitable technology for IoT enabled applications of smart cities
    [17] as they would enable higher transmission capabilities like higher bandwidths,
    ultra low latency, etc. [18]. Download : Download high-res image (199KB) Download

    lives. 5G offers cellular as well as Device to Device (D2D) communications to
    provide greater bandwidth and ultra low latency required for IoT enabled applications
    of smart cities [19]. Specifically, the D2D communications that occur in 5G is
    possible through cellular services and through WiFi (wireless fidelity) Direct
    [20]. Although cellular coverage is widely useful but it fails to facilitate smart
    city applications in areas with no or partial coverage [21]. On the other hand,
    WiFi Direct operates without intermediate infrastructure and offers increased
    data rate and even lesser latency [22]. WiFi Direct can easily facilitate the
    close proximity communications for various smart city applications [23]. The review
    of the requirements of smart cities discloses that D2D services provided via WiFi
    Direct is the most appropriate technology to implement smart city applications
    [24], [25]. Although the technology is best fit for the IoT enabled smart city
    applications [26], [27], [28] but has some security threats [29], which if not
    taken care can prove fatal for the whole communication system [30]. There are
    many risk elements that jeopardize the D2D communications. Node impersonation,
    eavesdropping and message modification are some of the major attacks [31]. Attackers
    can easily sneak up on the information being shared on the wireless medium [32].
    Consequently, sensitive data is exposed to misuse [33]. An attacker can also act
    as a legitimate node when it is not one; the receiver cannot decipher the real
    identity of the sender [34]. The message payload can be modified by an attacker,
    resulting in misinterpretation and uncertain outcomes [35]. Illegitimate entities
    can disrupt the private communication between devices, otherwise called as Man-in-the-middle
    (MITM) attack [36]. Hence, it becomes very crucial to verify the legitimacy of
    the sender and receiver which is why mutual authentication is required [37], [38],
    [39]. The communication of the legitimate entities can also be interrupted by
    initiating a flood attack wherein the target device is bombarded with discovery
    requests, making it difficult to communicate with the right device on time [40],
    [41]. Strong discovery protocols are the need of the hour when it comes to D2D
    communications even though it is a very promising technology. Clearly, the D2D
    communications needs protection from these security hazards (e.g., MITM, DoS,
    etc.) in order to be useful for the data transmission. The security measures must
    prevent any unauthorized identity to communicate with the authorized identity.
    There must be some mechanism through which the two genuine parties should exchange
    keys with each other securely without being captured by an attacker. As a solution
    to the aforementioned issues, we propose a mutual authentication and pairwise
    key establishment method that can certify the devices before any actual exchange
    of information occurs. 1.1. Research contribution This article proposes a security
    protocol for the D2D communications to protect the sensitive applications of smart
    cities. The important contributions of the article are summarized as follows:
    • We propose a lightweight and strong mutual authentication and key agreement
    protocol for D2D communications. • To achieve the robustness and lightweightness,
    the protocol applies commit/open pair, symmetric-key cryptography, message authentication
    code (MAC), diffie hellman key exchange (DHKE) algorithm, nonce, and other lightweight
    cryptography primitives such as bit-wise XOR, etc. • The proposed protocol enables
    the WiFi Direct devices to detect the occurrence of DoS attacks through intelligent
    filtering in the discovery phase; thus preserving precious resources of the devices
    e.g., computation power. • The strength of the proposed protocol is verified through
    formal (Burrows–Abadi–Needham logic) security analysis. Analysis revealed that
    the proposed protocol exhibits essential security properties, like mutual authentication,
    message freshness, secret key confidentiality, etc. In addition, the protocol
    is also protected from MITM, DoS, and replay attacks, and so forth. • The proposed
    protocol provides early detection to DoS attack and more security against MITM
    attack in comparison to state-of-the-art. • The protocol verifies the establishment
    of identical key at both devices to avoid erroneous use of secret keys for applications
    like ciphering, etc. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2
    discusses the background of Wi-Fi Direct and Short Authentication String (SAS)
    based key agreement protocol along with their limitations and cryptanalysis. Section
    3 defines the notations and security goals. Section 4 elaborates the working of
    the proposed protocol whereas Section 5 provides the performance, security, and
    comparative analysis. Finally, Section 6 draws the conclusions. Download : Download

    protocol. 2. Background The direct transmission of data between two devices through
    radio signals without having to go through a base station or cellular network
    in D2D communications brings unprecedented benefits [42]. Bypassing the infrastructure
    to enable communication reduces cost, improves efficiency and offers low latency
    [43]. D2D allows spontaneous sharing and exchange of information that speeds up
    the utility of smart devices enabled by the Internet of things (IoT) [44]. The
    close proximity of devices that enable D2D is making it one of the most essential
    technologies in applications spread across smart cities like smart parking, area
    surveillance, waste management, etc. [21]. The assistance provided by the cloud
    servers in various real time applications [40] is enhanced by the presence of
    the communicating devices in each other’s vicinity as it enables faster data offloading
    [45]. In small spaces, D2D communications using WiFi Direct dispenses a faster
    data rate that saves data exchange and computation costs [46]. D2D using WiFi
    Direct, which is an extension of the traditional WiFi, makes the provision of
    a scalable framework by omitting the need of Access Points (APs) [47]. The devices
    do not require any AP for communication rather the devices themselves act as AP
    to form peer-to-peer groups [48]. The device serving as AP is also recognized
    as group owner (GO) [49]. GO device can send the GO signal as a relay for communication
    amongst all the devices in the group [50]. There is no loss of quality or energy
    in this method of communication as compared to the traditional data exchange through
    WiFi adhoc and IEEE 802.11z [51]. An open network is most susceptible to blockage
    and this is the biggest challenge in D2D communications [52]. Most D2D applications
    consist of sensitive data and any tampering with it can cause irreversible damage
    [53]. The security loopholes of open access channels allow the cyber attackers
    to easily create fake setup links and cause network disruptions [54]. Since the
    open medium is the leverage of the D2D communication, it becomes more obvious
    for the devices to protect themselves [55], [56]. Security offered by the WiFi
    Protection Setup (WPS) is not robust enough for D2D communications [57], [58].
    This is why smart security protocols are the need of the hour considering the
    rising deployment of D2D using 5G in smart city applications [59], [60] directly
    concerning human safety, healthwise and livingwise. Security challenges are a
    rising area of research in D2D technologies but there is still a long way to go
    considering the available methods of protection from attacks like MITM and DoS
    [41]. When the responsibility of security is deemed to lie with the devices themselves,
    a trusted authentication mechanism between two devices can prevent the security
    risks [61]. This trusted mechanism will allow the devices to authenticate each
    other mutually followed by pairwise key establishment to prevent from prior mentioned
    attacks (MITM, DoS, etc.) [62], [63], [64], [65]. This paper introduces a strong
    mutual authentication and key agreement protocol for D2D communications over WiFi
    direct powered by IoT and driven by 5G. 2.1. WiFi Direct overview The WiFi Direct
    protocol enables the devices to establish a wireless connection without any mediator
    [66]. The peer-to-peer (P2P) communication without the access point (or a router)
    is initiated by two or more peer devices which first discover each other and then
    form a P2P group [67] as shown in Fig. 2. The devices set up a communication link
    before the full information exchange begins. Next step is the negotiation for
    the selection of a P2P GO, called the handshake process by sending out an intent
    value [68]. Each device in the P2P group sends out an intent value. The device
    possessing a greater intent value wins the negotiation and becomes the P2P GO
    which then acts as the AP as indicated in Fig. 2. This is followed by the beginning
    of a security process using WPS by the P2P GO [69]. Subsequently, IP addresses
    for both the devices are generated by the GO using Dynamic Host Configuration
    Protocol (DHCP) [70]. Thus, the D2D connection is established successfully between
    the devices enabled with WiFi Direct. There are several applications of D2D communications,
    but two majorly witnessed applications are discussed in this section. Through
    WiFi Direct, P2P GO can share its internet services obtained from Base station
    (Cellular) with other devices (clients) of the P2P group [71]. The scenario has
    been illustrated in Fig. 3. Another scenario is presented in Fig. 4 where numerous
    devices form a localized adhoc network [72]. Devices are performing various tasks
    (e.g., image uploading, printing, file sharing, etc.) using WiFi Direct services
    at no extra cost. This feature of WiFi Direct is particularly helpful during the
    absentia of cellular services or an AP. Download : Download high-res image (102KB)

    2.2. Short-Authentication-String (SAS) based key agreement protocol The authors
    of SAS based key agreement protocol claims to introduce a novel mutual authentication
    and key establishment scheme for D2D communications; the scheme operates with
    minimum human interaction and limited cryptography operations. SAS protocol employs
    a commitment scheme where the secret value is enclosed behind the commit/open
    pair. The commit/open pair is designed in such a way that a commitment value alone
    does not disclose any information about the secret value. As demonstrated in Fig.
    5, the commit/open pair intends to provide secure mutual authentication. SAS makes
    use of traditional diffie hellman key exchange protocol as the basic underlying
    mechanism to establish the secret key. Apart from diffie hellman parameters and
    , SAS protocol generates device identifiers and along with nonces, and . Device
    employing SAS protocol generates the secret value, , and afterward computes commit/open
    pair, , wherein ‘ ’ and ‘ ’ represents commitment and disclose value, respectively
    [62]. Let us consider the following commitment scheme wherein F is a cryptographic
    hash function: • Commit: Given , randomly choose , , compute , . • Open: Let ,
    . Output w if , . In simple terms, the receiving device accepts the secret value
    if i.e., earlier received commit value. Consider a scenario, where Alice and Bob
    want to communicate using D2D communications via WiFi Direct. A couple of messages
    are exchanged between them to verify the identity of each other followed by common
    secret key generation. Initially Alice shares a commitment value with Bob as shown
    in Fig. 5. In response, Bob exchanges with Alice. Upon reception of , Alice shares
    the other value of the pair (open value, ) to allow Bob to extract the secret
    value, . Subsequently, the devices verify the identity of each other by computing
    the SAS, and . Post successful verification, both the devices compute to generate
    the secret key. In another instance, if the authentication string does not match
    ( ), the key establishment process is terminated by the devices assuming the presence
    of MITM attack. 2.3. Limitations of WiFi WPS The WiFi Direct is protected through
    the WiFi Protected Setup (WPS) that uses a secure PIN or push button configuration.
    WPS attempts to provide security by letting the WiFi Direct GO act as the registrar
    to send network security credentials to the WiFi Direct clients. Afterward, a
    set of security keys are generated by the WiFi Protected Access (WPA) protocol
    to secure the communications. However, during the investigation by the authors
    in [58], it is found that PIN can be easily discovered by the attacker within
    a small fraction of time, resulting in the revealing of secret keys and comprising
    overall communications. Besides, the attacker exploits the vulnerabilities of
    the push button configuration to get unauthorized access to the registrar or client,
    hence putting the entire ad-hoc network at high risk [73]. Since the attacker
    obtained access, messages can be intercepted and modified that can lead to irreversible
    damage to crucial real-life assets, etc. 2.4. Cryptanalysis of SAS based key agreement
    protocol We have critically analyzed the working of the SAS protocol and observed
    a few vulnerabilities. The attacker can compromise the whole network by exploiting
    these vulnerabilities. The vulnerabilities and its possible consequences are illustrated
    in Fig. 6 and summarized as follows: 1. Short authentication strings, and are
    said to have been compared over a trusted channel. Ideally, wireless channels
    are always considered vulnerable and subjected to attacks, primarily eavesdropping.
    Lack of trusted wireless channels is the biggest motivation behind the discovery
    of well known diffie hellman and ECC diffie hellman key exchange protocols. The
    security strength of the SAS based key agreement scheme lies in the authentication
    string ( , ) which is shared in plain text over the vulnerable wireless channel.
    Eavesdropping of the authentication string can allow the attacker to successfully
    conduct the MITM attack, thus compromising the communications. 2. The SAS based
    key agreement protocol in itself does not mention any remark on the requirement
    of time synchronization between devices. There is no lifetime ( ) or timestamp
    ( ) associated with the secret values ( , ) and SAS ( , ), thus enabling the attacker
    to misuse the information. Upon reception of the SAS in plain text, the attacker
    device can read and counterfeit the SAS. Further, the attacker can share this
    counterfeited SAS with a legitimate node to gain trust and enable the legitimate
    node to begin computations for secret key establishment. 3. Consider a scenario
    where Alice begins the communication with Bob but somehow Eve (attacker) intervenes.
    Alice initially computes, and transforms it into , pair. Eve pretends to Alice
    as Bob and receives . But Eve cannot determine unless provided with . Similarly,
    Eve pretends to Bob as Alice, computes , and sends the commit value to Bob instead
    of sending . Bob in reply, returns to Eve (considering her as Alice). Eve modifies
    the to ( ) and sends it further to Alice. Afterward, Alice shares the open value,
    with Eve which enables Eve to retrieve ( ). Instead of sending , Eve send to Bob,
    thus allowing Bob to retrieve ( ) from , pair. Currently, Alice knows , , Bob
    knows , whereas Eve knows , , , and . Since the secret values, and are exchanged,
    Alice and Bob begin the computation of a short authentication string, and . The
    computed authentication strings ( , ) are supposed to be shared by Alice and Bob
    with each other for mutual authentication. But the Eve exploits the vulnerability
    of wireless channels and intercepts the short authentication strings shared by
    Alice, , and Bob, . Since the authentication strings are in readable format and
    not tied to any timestamp/lifetime, therefore Eve gets enough time to manipulate
    the information and misuse it. Eve counterfeits the SAS of Alice and Bob and then
    share the counterfeited value, ( ) and ( ) with Alice and Bob, respectively. In
    other instance, Eve instead of counterfeiting can also produce and as Eve already
    has the knowledge of , , and . Alice and Bob verify and , respectively, and concludes
    successful mutual authentication without being aware of fraud by Eve. Post successful
    fraudulent mutual authentication, Alice produces a secret key, , Bob produces
    a secret key, , and Eve produces two secret keys, and . As a result, Alice and
    Eve hold a common key, and Bob and Eve hold a common key. As Alice and Bob are
    not aware about the presence of Eve, therefore they continue to use the fraudulent
    secret key with the belief of securing the communications, however in reality
    they were getting cheated by Eve. Investigations and analysis revealed that SAS
    based key agreement protocol is subjected to MITM attack and also not secure enough
    to be used for D2D communications. 4. SAS based key agreement protocol is partially
    protected against the DoS attack. There is no process to identify and prevent
    the DoS attack in the discovery phase. As a result, the devices waste their precious
    resources in accepting and processing bogus requests (e.g., wasting bandwidth
    and computing power for processing SAS of fraudulent requests, etc.). 5. Though
    SAS based key agreement protocol claims to verify the authentication string (
    , ) for mutual authentication purposes but lacks to verify the establishment of
    identical secret keys ( , ) at both entities. Download : Download high-res image

    attains the following significant security goals. Note that the security goals
    are adopted from [74], [75], [76]. 1. Mutual Authentication: D2D communications
    are vulnerable due to the open access nature of communication. The IoT enabled
    smart city applications produce enormous amounts of sensitive data. The access
    to this data must be restricted to legitimate nodes only to avoid misuse of precious
    information. The D2D communications can be protected by performing mutual authentication
    to verify the legitimacy of nodes before initializing the session. 2. Secret Key
    Establishment: IoT devices deployed in smart cities generate pivotal information.
    The information is exchanged with the cloud and other end users/devices through
    untrusted wireless channels. Nodes with malicious intentions can easily eavesdrop
    the information and use it for exploiting the services of legitimate nodes. Therefore,
    D2D devices must exchange a secret key through a secure process to enable ciphering,
    etc. 3. Message Integrity: Modifications in the message can destroy the essence
    of the information, thus leaving behind the bogus content of no use. Therefore,
    D2D devices must verify the integrity of the messages before using the information
    for further processing. 4. Message Freshness: Adversary can capture the messages
    due to the inherently vulnerable nature of wireless medium. The captured stale
    messages can be replayed by the adversary to get privileged access to information.
    Thus, D2D communications must ensure the use of freshness components in the message
    exchanges to protect from adversarial threats (e.g., replay). 5. Defense against
    prominent attacks: IoT networks are susceptible to threats due to vulnerabilities
    in security protocols. The impact of attack can be mild or severe and may lead
    to temporary or permanent suspension of smart city applications. Therefore, security
    protocols must be robust enough to combat against significant attacks like DoS,
    MITM, etc. 3.3. Adversary model A practical adversary model has been considered
    to evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme in compromised conditions.
    Considering Dolev–Yao adversary model, it is assumed that the attacker is equipped
    with a digital device and sophisticated tools with abundant computational power
    and storage capabilities. It is believed that the attacker has the knowledge to
    mount various attacks that can harm and disrupt the functioning of the IoT networks.
    For instance, the adversary can send fake requests during the discovery phase
    to the victim IoT node, thus resulting in inefficient utilization of precious
    resources due to unnecessary computation of fake requests. Besides, the attacker
    can also eavesdrop on the messages containing secret credentials that can be misused
    by the adversary to conduct known key attacks. Similarly, adversaries can replay
    the captured messages to gain unauthorized access to privileged information. The
    adversary can cleverly target the IoT nodes with MITM attack, hence resulting
    in compromising of present and future communications. Based on the attacker capabilities,
    it can be concluded that adversarial threats can have mild to severe impact on
    the IoT enabled smart city applications. 4. Proposed protocol D2D communications
    via WiFi Direct is accomplished through four different phases, i.e., discovery,
    negotiation, mutual authentication and key agreement, followed by address configuration.
    The most sensitive phases where the adversary prefers to attack are discovery
    and key agreement phases. The devices operating in the WiFi Direct (WFD) environment
    always remain partially active to respond to the probe requests of the nearby
    devices. However, the adversaries exploit the discovery mechanism by sending bogus
    probe requests to the legitimate devices, thus resulting in draining of precious
    resources such as battery, computing power, storage space, and so forth. Consequently,
    the victimized device fails to deliver the services to the legitimate devices
    i.e., Denial of Service. Besides discovery phase, key agreement phase is also
    victimized by the adversaries because interception of key exchange messages through
    MITM attack could compromise the future correspondence between devices in a D2D
    network. To counter the threat of DoS attack, the proposed scheme employs an intelligent
    filtering mechanism at discovery phase. In addition, a robust and lightweight
    mutual authentication and key establishment (MAKE) scheme at key agreement phase
    is invoked to protect the WFD enabled devices from MITM attack. The intelligent
    filtering mechanism sweeps out the malicious requests whereas the MAKE scheme
    does not allow the impersonated devices to initiate a session with the legitimate
    devices. Therefore, the proposed protocol presented in Fig. 7 can protect the
    D2D communications from DoS and MITM attacks and it can be considered as a potential
    solution for securing various smart city applications. Table 2 discusses the various
    instances where the protocol applies its intelligent algorithm to differentiate
    between malicious and legitimate probe requests. Note that two parameters namely
    Media Access Control (MAC) address and Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI)
    have been used to determine the authenticity of the probe request. MAC address
    alias physical address of the device is considered unique globally, therefore
    it has been used to discriminate between WFD enabled devices [77], [78], [79]
    whereas RSSI has been used to determine the estimated location of the WFD enabled
    devices [80], [81], [82]. The mechanism used in the discovery phase is more effective
    in identifying malicious requests originated from stationery devices. Table 2
    and Algorithm 1 demonstrates the set of rules invoked to effectively discriminate
    between legitimate and malicious probe requests at discovery phase. Download :

    their interest by sending the probe request messages (consisting of MAC address
    and other details) to each other. Note that the terms node and device are interchangeably
    used and represent the same meaning. Let us review the set of actions performed
    by a node for filtering malicious requests. Device 1 sends a probe request to
    Device 2 and in turn seeks its probe response to lead further communication. However,
    unlike traditional security protocols, Device 2 examines the credentials before
    issuing the probe response. Device 2 particularly verifies two factors i.e., MAC
    address and RSSI before issuing probe response to the Device 1. Few Assumptions:
    The nodes are installed distributively for performing various tasks in smart cities
    (e.g., smart bins, smart traffic lights, rainwater harvesting, etc.). The devices
    are installed permanently (stationary). MAC address and RSSI can be used to differentiate
    between D2D devices. The factors which affect the RSSI (e.g., weather conditions,
    signal power to antenna unit, and so forth) are considered constant. Download

    retrieves the MAC address and RSSI from the received probe request message that
    arrived from device 1. Afterward, the retrieved information, i.e., MAC address
    and RSSI is compared with the information stored in the memory of device 2. Note
    that indicates the MAC address of device 1 and indicates the strength of the device
    1 signal at the receiving device, . Since no similar request has been facilitated
    by the earlier, therefore the device 2 considers the request as fresh and grants
    the response to continue with GO negotiation phase. It is evident from Table 2
    and Algorithm 1 that in the second instance, the attacker device sends the probe
    request with a forged MAC address ( ) to the legitimate node, . compares the and
    with its database entries. Upon verification, finds that a request has already
    been received earlier with the similar RSSI value, therefore aborts the communication
    considering it as a malicious request. In another instance , receives the request
    with a counterfeited MAC address and similar RSSI value, hence concludes it as
    bogus request with malicious intentions. Consequently, prohibits the processing
    of malicious requests, thus resulting in preservation of resources for legitimate
    nodes. It is evident from the that the proposed protocol easily determines the
    reception of a new probe request from a legitimate WFD enabled device by examining
    the MAC address and RSSI value. It can be observed from algorithm 1 that the alterations
    proposed in the discovery phase of the conventional WiFi Direct protocol can partially
    protect the D2D communications from DoS attacks. The proposed protocol intends
    to fill the shortcomings of the SAS based key agreement protocol. The proposed
    protocol integrates timestamp (TS) and lifetime (LT) to prevent the misuse of
    , , , and by attacker for gaining trust of legitimate nodes. Besides, the proposed
    protocol also protects the D2D communications from MITM attack by prohibiting
    the transmission of short authentication strings in plain text. Moreover, the
    protocol verifies the generation of identical secret keys on both devices to avoid
    use of erroneous keys. Note that errors can be caused due to many reasons: analog
    to digital conversion process, wireless channel fading, modifications by attackers,
    etc. The working of the proposed mutual authentication and key establishment scheme
    is illustrated in Fig. 8 and algorithm 2. Consider a scenario where Alice (Device
    A) wants to communicate with Bob (Device B). Besides, diffie hellman parameters
    ( and ), Alice and Bob generates a random nonce, and , respectively, to add a
    freshness component in the message. A private value is also chosen by Alice ‘
    ’ and Bob ‘ ’ to be applied to diffie hellman parameters, and . After the computations,
    Alice and Bob concatenates the device identifiers ( , ), diffie hellman parameter
    ( , ), and the random nonce ( , ) to form the secret value, ( ) and ( ) respectively.

    Fig. 8. Mutual authentication and secret key establishment between Device A and
    B. But instead of sending to Bob, Alice breaks the information into a commit/open
    pair. The secret value ( ) is divided into two separate components in such a way
    that commitment value ( ) does not disclose anything about hidden secret value
    unless open value ( ) is not applied. Therefore, Alice shares commit value with
    Bob; Bob in turn shares the secret value with Alice. Upon reception of , Alice
    sends the open value to allow Bob retrieve . After the exchange of a couple of
    messages, both Alice and Bob begin the computation of short authentication strings
    for mutual authentication. Alice computes whereas Bob computes . After generating
    the authentication strings, Alice and Bob computes the secret key; Alice computes,
    and Bob computes, . Alice and Bob have formed the secret keys but it remains unused
    unless the devices verify the authenticity of each other. Alice generates the
    TS with LT to avoid replay attacks. It is recommended to keep the lifetime (LT)
    value equivalent to the propagation time of message from source to destination,
    to prohibit the attacker from capturing, modifying and replaying [83]. Alice computes
    the message authentication code of , , and with the secret key, . The message
    authentication code transforms the information to a non-interpretable form, thereby
    not permitting the attacker to interpret, alter, and misuse. Similarly, Bob also
    concatenates the with received and to compute the message authentication code
    with secret key, . Lastly, both the devices exchange and compare the message authentication
    code, if it renders the same value, it indicates successful mutual authentication
    and key establishment. The protocol only makes use of lightweight cryptography
    operations like message authentication code and bit-wise XOR, therefore it can
    be considered as the best fit for resource constrained devices and applications
    of smart cities. Download : Download high-res image (313KB) Download : Download

    analysis The proposed scheme aims to protect the D2D communications from adversarial
    threats, especially DoS and MITM attacks. The performance of the scheme has been
    analyzed through simulations executed on a platform with specifications as: intel
    core - processor with operating frequency of 2.10 GHz, -bit operating system,
    GB RAM, cache memory MB, memory speed MT/s, and supported wireless LAN standards
    IEEE 802.11 . Dev C compiler has been used with the required libraries (types.h,
    socket.h, netinet/in.h) for implementation and testing of the proposed protocol.
    As mentioned earlier, the presented scheme is more effective in protecting against
    DoS attacks triggered by malicious stationary nodes, therefore the current performance
    investigation has been confined to stationary nodes only, whereas evaluation of
    the scheme under the influence of malicious mobile nodes is the future scope of
    the research. The simulation results of the proposed scheme have been demonstrated
    in this section. Initially the interested device sends a probe request to the
    target device during the discovery phase as shown in Fig. 9. Since the probe request
    is fresh, the device 2 allocates the resources to the source node for continuing
    further. The attacker can deploy its malicious node in the network to trigger
    DoS attacks. Malicious node executes the DoS attack by flooding the victim node
    with bogus requests. Consequently, the legitimate node exhausts all its precious
    resources (e.g., system crash) in processing the fake requests, thus preventing
    the node from processing the valid requests [84], [85], [86], [87]. Fig. 10 illustrates
    how the proposed scheme empowers the legitimate node to identify the probe requests
    with forged credentials. Upon verification of the probe request, it is found that
    the request received has arrived from the same node (Device 1) with intentions
    to trigger DoS attack in the network. Therefore, the legitimate node (Device 2)
    refrains from processing the request, thus preserving resources to serve genuine
    requests in future. Download : Download high-res image (170KB) Download : Download

    Case of new neighboring device. As illustrated in Fig. 11, the attacker node tries
    to re-attempt the DoS attack by sending the bogus request, however the device
    2 examines the request and finds out that a request with similar credentials has
    already been processed, thereby discarding the request. When another legitimate
    device in the vicinity reveals its interest through a probe request, the device
    2 follows the same procedure and verifies the credentials. It is evident from
    Fig. 12 that the new device is allocated with the resources because its credentials
    (MAC address and RSSI) are different from the stored credentials in the database.
    Since the scheme is tested for stationary nodes without considering the factors
    affecting RSSI, it can be inferred that the proposed scheme can partially protect
    the D2D communications from DoS attacks. Since the smart city applications contain
    precious information, therefore devices must verify the authenticity of each other
    followed by secret key establishment to secure the communication from adversarial
    threats. Algorithm 2 and Fig. 8 demonstrates the steps of execution while Fig.
    13, Fig. 14 reveals the outcome of execution. It is apparent from the simulations
    that Device A and Device B are able to exchange the secret keys securely after
    successful mutual authentication. Download : Download high-res image (418KB) Download

    of the scheme in diverse compromised conditions. The security analysis has been
    performed using the well known BAN logic. Formal Proof using BAN Logic The formal
    proof using BAN logic [74] evaluates the strength of the protocol using logical
    rules to verify the accomplishment of secret key between both devices in the insecure
    environment. 1. BAN Logic Notations: The notations and symbols used are directly
    adopted from [74] to evaluate the robustness of the scheme as follows: • : Let
    X and Y be two principal entities where ‘X believes Y’. • : Only ‘X sees Y’, i.e.,
    only X can interpret and replicate Y. • : ‘X once said Y’, principal X sent a
    message comprising Y. • : ‘X has control over Y’, the principal X is an authority
    on Y and should be trusted. • : The principal X and Y have message (M) that contains
    the secret parameters. • : Fresh(Y), i.e., Y is not used in earlier message exchanges.
    • : The and used a secret key for securing the communication. It is believed that
    key is disclosed only to the designated legitimate principals. • : Message is
    encrypted using the secret key . • : is amalgamated with the secret parameter
    . • : X has the private key, K. • : X has the public key, K. 2. BAN Logical Rules:
    The logical rules referred from [74] are invoked to examine the protocol as follows:
    (a) Message-meaning rule (b) Nonce-verification rule (c) Control rule (d) If a
    principal sees a formula, then it also sees its components, provided he knows
    the necessary keys (e) Fresh rule If one part of a formula is fresh, then the
    entire formula must also be fresh [74]. 3. Formal Verification of the proposed
    protocol: The evaluation process is carried out in four steps: (i) message idealization,
    (ii) assumptions, (iii) expected goals, and (iv) logic verification. (i) Message
    idealization: Message idealization specify the messages exchanged between Device
    A and B. The idealized messages for the proposed protocol are summarized as follows:
    Between Device A and B: (ii) Assumptions: In proposed protocol, a principal believes
    that (a) nonces are fresh, (b) it has shared secrets and keys, (c) a legitimate
    principal has control over the entitled components and values. The following are
    the intuitive assumptions: Between Device A and B: • For the Device A: • For the
    Device B: (iii) Expected goals: The security goals define the necessary security
    properties that a security protocol should exhibit. The significant security goals
    that the proposed protocol aims to achieve is summarized as follows: (iv) Logic
    verification: Based on the assumptions, message idealization, and rules, the logic
    verification has been performed and proven as follows: According to ( ) and (
    ), believes and the message ( , ) that contain secret parameters which will be
    used to derive the secret session key . computes from pair and obtain: By applying
    message meaning rule and , we obtain If the device believes the device and so
    the , then it also believes in the diffie hellman parameter ( ) shared by device
    . By applying and , we obtain that: Hence, the goal : has been achieved, and similarly,
    the goal can be accomplished. , where , , and are the components of different
    messages sent by . According to : , receives the open value from . computes the
    secret value using the commit/open pair and deduce nonce, . is a random positive
    integer generated by for freshness. By applying rule ‘b’ (Nonce verification),
    rule ‘e’ (Freshness), and , we obtain: Considering , receives in the message from
    . retrieves the and from the . and are incorporated by for freshness and prevention
    against replay attacks. By applying rule ‘d’, rule ‘e’, , and we obtain: Thus,
    the goal has been realized successfully, i.e.,  believes that are fresh. Likewise,

    with conventional protocols. 5.3. Comparative analysis It is worth noting that
    the proposed scheme is a subset of traditional WiFi Direct and SAS based key agreement
    protocol. The proposed scheme is an initiative to strengthen the security and
    eliminate the vulnerabilities of conventional protocols disclosed by the authors
    in Sections 2.3 Limitations of WiFi WPS, 2.4 Cryptanalysis of SAS based key agreement
    protocol. Fig. 15 illustrates the difference between the WiFi Direct, SAS based
    key agreement, and proposed protocol. In the past, most approaches have not focused
    on safeguarding the discovery phase, despite knowing the fact that adversaries
    prefer to accomplish DoS attacks in this phase. On the contrary, the proposed
    scheme (refer algorithm 1 and Table 2) not only prevents the legitimate devices
    from processing the fake requests but also enhances the active lifetime of the
    devices and ad-hoc networks. The authentication set-up of conventional protocols
    are insufficient to provide complete security solutions. Fig. 16 highlights the
    difference in the mutual authentication and key exchange process of proposed and
    conventional protocols. Despite the fact that SAS based key agreement protocol
    made a decent attempt to prevent MITM attack, the cryptanalysis revealed the vulnerabilities
    that can be easily exploited by the attackers to accomplish the MITM attack. The
    proposed protocol extends the SAS based key agreement approach to overcome the
    limitations, and extend the robustness of the approach. Some significant observations
    can be drawn from Fig. 16 which are summarized as follows: (i) the authentication
    strings are not sent in plain text, (ii) timestamp and lifetime are incorporated
    to prevent replay attacks, and (iii) verifies the establishment of identical key
    at both devices to avoid erroneous use, and so forth. The successful execution,
    robustness verification, and comparative analysis proves the supremacy of the
    proposed scheme in contrast to the traditional approaches. Download : Download

    enabled smart cities have revolutionized the ecosystem by automating the majority
    of the processes, including billing of energy meters, emergency services during
    accidents and disasters, and so on. WiFi Direct, a branch of D2D communications
    used in the 5G technology is the most appropriate candidate to relay the real
    time information with minimum latency. However, due to absentia of intermediate
    infrastructure, and insecure wireless channels, the smart city applications become
    fragile. Few traditional security approaches, to name a few, WPS and SAS based
    key agreement protocol are found vulnerable to PIN disclosure and MITM attacks,
    respectively. Considering the above risk exposures, the authors devised a strong
    mutual authentication and key establishment protocol for WFD enabled devices to
    conquer the adversarial threats. The proposed protocol not only prevents DoS attacks
    in the discovery phase rather protects the network from MITM attacks in the key
    agreement phase. The formal security analysis using BAN logic demonstrates its
    strength against the diverse cyber attacks. It is apparent from the outcomes of
    the research that the proposed scheme can ensure the security of smart city applications.
    The future extension of this research work might include the performance analysis
    of the proposed model considering malicious mobile nodes, inclusion of factors
    affecting RSSI, and multiple malicious nodes triggering the DoS attack simultaneously
    in the ad-hoc network. Additionally, end to end network delay, latency, computation
    overhead, and throughput of the proposed technique will be calculated and presented
    as a part of future research work. CRediT authorship contribution statement Gurjot

  explanation: The paper aims to present a novel method for simulating flood water
    surfaces in a 3D flood visualization system using a combination of Fast Fourier
    Transform (FFT) and Perlin noise algorithms. The FFT algorithm is employed to
    generate a realistic water surface based on a Philip spectrum. However, to address
    the issue of overly stable and periodic water surfaces produced by the FFT algorithm,
    the authors introduce a Perlin noise perturbation to add irregularity and detail
    to the water surface, making it more realistic and visually appealing.
  extract_1: Specifically, the authors state that "with the development of modern
    technology, there are many dangers facing flood control information security,
    so it is necessary to strengthen the protection of flood control data security."
    This highlights the growing need for robust access control and authentication
    mechanisms in flood management systems to safeguard sensitive data and prevent
    unauthorized access or tampering.

    Location: Beijing, China SECTION I. Introduction In the field of water conservancy
    informatization, the 3D flood visualization system combines 3D visualization technology
    with traditional flood data display methods, which can intuitively display the
    evolution process and occurrence range of floods, and can provide an important
    reference for flood control decision-making. Practical 3D visualization technology
    can not only provide hydrological data to users in the most intuitive way by simulating
    real scenes, but also integrate rich interactive methods with 3D scene roaming
    and display technologies into the 3D visualization system allowing users better
    understand the key information contained in hydrological data. The system can
    greatly improve the efficiency of flood control and emergency flood control system
    scheduling decision-making. At present, the flood visualization system has been
    widely used in various regions’ flood control work, which greatly improves the
    accuracy and effectiveness of decision-making work of flood control and disaster
    prevention. However, in the current application practice of flood visualization
    systems, most of them use a two-dimensional flood evolution simulation system.
    At the visual display level, only pictures are used to mark the flood range and
    location on the map. At the same time, many current systems are based on Client/Server”
    architecture, so most of the water simulations are implemented using interfaces,
    which cannot reflect the characteristics of water well and have shortcomings such
    as poor code reusability and low execution efficiency. Therefore, in the field
    of flood visualization, for the simulation of flood water in the current flood
    visualization system, there are the following two problems: Lack of display of
    flood details; the system’s visualization page lacks flood stage changes such
    as fluctuations, flood peaks and other morphological details of flood changes
    with flow velocity; the fidelity of the flood water body is low, and the visualization
    effect is poor; At present, most of the modeling algorithms for flood water directly
    use the original waveform algorithm for simulation, which has disadvantages such
    as complex calculation and low execution efficiency and the effect of real-time
    rendering is low especially when 3D simulation is performed. Aiming at the above
    problems, this paper proposes a flood simulation method based on Perlin noise
    perturbation of FFT. By integrating the FFT algorithm and the Perlin noise algorithm
    to simulate the flood water body, on the one hand, the complex waveform of the
    flood water surface can be simulated in real time through FFT, and on the other
    hand, the Perlin noise is used to add perturbation to the wave so that the simulated
    water surface can better fit the scene with irregular flood wave surface and improve
    the authenticity of the 3D model. The method proposed in this paper can make the
    3D visualization technology more fully apply to the field of water conservancy.
    Flood routing simulation has always been the key means and important basis for
    government departments to make decisions in the face of flood control and disaster
    reduction. The 3D flood visualization technology of real scene simulation and
    real-time feedback of changes is helpful to help decision makers better analyze
    the real characteristics of flood disasters and improve the scientificity and
    efficiency of decision-making. SECTION II. Related Work Jeschke et al. [1] proposed
    a wavelet transformation that discretizes the liquid motion in terms of amplitude-like
    functions that vary over space, frequency, and direction, effectively generalizing
    Fourier-based methods to handle local interactions. Skrivan et al. [2] proposed
    a method to enhance the visual detail of a water surface simulation which takes
    a simulation as input and increases its apparent resolution by simulating many
    detailed Lagrangian water waves on top of it. The method can produce high frequency
    ripples and is easy to parallelize. Khater et al. [3] harnessed suitable wave
    transformation to make the Benjamin-Bona-Mahony-Peregrine (BBMP) equation give
    plentiful solitary wave solutions and many solutions have been applied to study
    the shallow water wave in ocean beaches. Ma et al. [4] proposed the method of
    combining the method of using GPU to quickly generate water surface effect simulation
    with light and shadow effects, the method only uses a small amount of sine wave
    superposition to approximately generate water surface, which not only improves
    the authenticity of water surface, but also improves the efficiency of water rendering;
    Stuhlmeier et al. [5] solved the problem of fluctuation transfer in fluid simulation
    by applying Gerstner’s nonlinear solution; Li et al. [6] introduced the idea of
    probability and statistics and proposed a ocean wave simulation method based on
    Gerstner-Rankine model, which improves the real-time performance of rendering
    on the premise of meeting the fidelity of virtual environment; Tessendorf et al.
    [7] proposed a method of retrieving ocean wave spectrum based on FFT from the
    perspective of frequency domain to simulate the water surface, and simulated the
    realistic real-time water surface scene with high flexibility; Chi et al. [8]
    proposed a broadband frequency domain beamforming method based on non-uniform
    FFT for underwater real-time 3D imaging, which greatly reduces the calculation
    order of the algorithm and improves the efficiency of real-time rendering. However,
    the existing water body modeling technology still has the problems of poor water
    modeling effect and distortion of flood simulation when applied to the field of
    flood simulation. In the specific application scenario of flood 3D visualization
    system, existing technology models cannot well reflect the characteristics of
    flood water body, and due to the complexity of modeling, it has the disadvantage
    of low execution efficiency. SECTION III. Preliminaries A. Time and Frequency
    Domains Fourier Transform is a linear integral transform that can be used to transform
    signals between time and frequency domains [9]. While Fast Fourier Transform is
    a general term for a collection of efficient and fast computational methods that
    can perform discrete Fourier transforms in time of 0(n log n). The core idea of
    the water body simulation method based on fast Fourier transform is to use the
    FFT algorithm to calculate the height of the water body surface, so as to construct
    a water body model. In detail, the algorithm combines the wave spectrum obtained
    from theoretical or water measurement statistics and a large number of sine waves
    to superimpose the waveform distribution in the frequency domain, and then performs
    the inverse FFT calculation to obtain the data in the time domain. The calculation
    obtains the real-time height of the water surface fluctuation, so various literatures
    often refer to it as a spectrum-based water body simulation method. The core of
    Fourier transform is the exchange between time domain and frequency domain [10].
    In signal analysis, time domain is used to describe the relationship between a
    physical signal or mathematical function and time, while frequency domain is used
    to describe the space or coordinate system used by frequency. The time domain
    is the most intuitive domain in our daily life. The definitions of physical quantities
    such as speed, current, power, etc. are all related to time. Although defining
    physical quantities with time as a reference will make it easier for us to understand,
    the form that is easy to understand is not necessarily the most convenient to
    calculate. So it needs to be transformed during the calculation to transform the
    intractable problems in the original space into the space that is easy to calculate,
    that is, the conversion from time domain to frequency domain. The relationship
    between time domain and frequency domain is shown in Figure 1. Figure 1. The relationship
    between time domain and frequency domain. Show All The time domain image is the
    waveform that we superimpose by sine waves, and the image formed by the frequencies
    of these sine waves is the frequency domain image, also known as the spectrum.
    In Figure 1, the functions displayed in the time domain and the frequency domain
    represent the same information, which is a composite function formed by combining
    several sine functions. In the frequency domain, only one vertical line can be
    used to represent the composite function, so the calculations are greatly simplified.
    Therefore, in order to realize a complex wave, we only need to generate a frequency
    domain image, that is the spectrum, and the water surface wave model corresponding
    to the spectrum can be obtained by inverse Fourier transform. B. Fast Fourier
    Transform Assuming f is a Lebesgue integrable function on the complex plane, the
    continuous Fourier transform F of f for any real number ω can be defined as: F(ω)=
    ∫ ∞ −∞ f(t) e −iωt dt (1) View Source In (1), ω represents the angular frequency
    of the signal function, and F(ω) is a complex number, which represents the amplitude
    and phase of the signal at this frequency. Then the corresponding inverse Fourier
    transform (IFT) is: f(t)= 1 2π ∫ ∞ −∞ F(ω) e iωt dω (2) View Source In practical
    applications, the functions we usually analyze are discrete in the time and frequency
    domains, and the computer cannot handle the continuous integration behavior in
    the Fourier transform, so it is usually sampled discretely. For discrete samples
    f[n] of the original function f(t) its discrete Fourier transform (DFT) is defined
    as: F[k]= ∑ n=0 N−1 f[n] e − 2π N ikn (3) View Source Then the corresponding inverse
    discrete Fourier transform (IDFT) is: f[n]= 1 N ∑ k=0 N−1 F[k] e 2π N ikn (4)
    View Source In (3) and (4), k represents the discrete frequency of the signal
    function, and n is the discrete signal sampling point where 0≤k≤N,0≤n≤N According
    to the above analysis, we can know that if the wave height of the flood h(x, z,
    t) is defined as a time domain signal on the plane x−z , according to the principle
    of Fourier transform, this signal can be approximately regarded as the superposition
    of a large number of sinusoidal signals. Therefore, as long as the frequency spectrum
    h( ω x , ω z ) of the water surface wave is obtained, h(x, z, t) can be obtained
    through IDFT, thus, the height field of water surface waves is obtained. The schematic
    diagram of the relationship between spectrum and water surface simulation is shown
    in Figure 2. Figure 2. The relationship between spectrum and water surface simulation.
    Show All In practical applications, considering the limitation of computer performance,
    the method of solving IDFT by brute force will consume a lot of CPU resources,
    so the FFT algorithm is introduced [10]. The core idea of the FFT algorithm is
    to use the idea of divide and conquer [11]. The schematic diagram is shown in
    Figure 3. As shown in Fig. 3, the original DFT8 is decomposed into two DFT4s through
    the idea of parity divide and conquer. The 2 DFT4s are calculated first, and then
    the result of DFT8 can be obtained by simple processing using butterfly process.
    For an FFT of length N, it can be divided into log 2 N stages, each stage has
    a total of N 2 butterfly units, and each butterfly unit only needs to perform
    one complex multiplication and two complex additions. So a total of complex multiplication
    needs to be calculated N 2 log 2 N times, and complex addition needs to be calculated
    N log 2 N times. The time complexity of the FFT algorithm is N log 2 N , while
    the time complexity of the ordinary Fourier transform algorithm is N2, and when
    N is larger, the efficiency of FFT algorithm is higher. It is a fast method to
    calculate the DFT and can call the computing power of the GPU well, greatly improving
    the computing efficiency. Figure 3. Divide and conquer principle of FFT algorithm
    Show All The water simulation method based on the FFT algorithm is not only globally
    controllable, but also can outline the very rich details of the model, which greatly
    shows the authenticity of the model. Therefore, it is widely used in game development,
    film and television and other water body surface rendering solutions. SECTION
    IV. 3D Modeling Method In this paper, a FFT flood simulation modeling method based
    on Perlin noise perturbation is proposed. The modeling method is shown in Figure
    4, and the specific steps are: First initialize the parameters, that is, set the
    initial plane, time, wave frequency, initial point and coordinates, and then calculate
    the spectrum h ~ ( k X ,  k Z ,t) of each point according to the Philip spectrum,
    where ( k X ,  k Z ) is the frequency domain coordinate, and the parameter t represents
    the spectrum changes with time; The water surface height is defined as the airspace
    signal h(x, z) on the airspace plane, and then according to the spectrum result
    calculated in step (1), the unperturbed water surface height h(x, z, t) is obtained
    through the row IFFT operation and the column IFFT operation respectively, and
    the conversion from the frequency domain to the airspace is realized; Define a
    lattice structure, determine the coordinates of the point as the input of the
    noise algorithm, calculate the distance vector between the input point and each
    adjacent lattice vertex, and multiply the vector to obtain the dot product; Use
    the ease curve to calculate the degree of ease, which is used as a weighting coefficient
    to weight the dot product, and the Perlin noise value corresponding to the input
    point is obtained by interpolation; The water surface height is perturbed by the
    Perlin noise to generate a new water body model. Figure 4. Modeling Method Process
    Show All A. Water Wave Modeling Methods In the actual application of FFT water
    surface simulation, the Phillips spectrum is usually used. Through the calculated
    spectrum, the height of the water surface can be further calculated. The formula

    zero, set m ′ =m+ N 2 ,  n ′ =n+ N 2 , m ′ , n ′ ∈{0,1,…,N−1} , (8) can be simplified

    N 2 +1,…, N 2 −1} , and because L=N , in order to make the subscripts start from
    zero, set u ′ =u+ N 2 , v ′ =v+ N 2 , then (9) can be decomposed into h( u ′ −
    N 2 , v ′ − N 2 ,t)= (−1 ) v ′ − N 2 ∑ m ′ =0 N−1 h ′′ ( u ′ − N 2 , m ′ ,t) e

    h(x, z, t) from the formula h(x,z,t)=A( u ′ , v ′ ,t)(−1 ) v ′ − N 2 (18) View
    Source Therefore, the calculation steps of FFT simulation water surface height
    are as follows: Obtain each h( k x , k z ,t) from Philip Spectrum formula; Obtain
    each h ′ ( n ′ , m ′ ,t) from h ~ ′ ( n ′ , m ′ ,t)= h ~ ( k x , k z ,t) ; Obtain
    each D( n ′ , m ′ ,t) from (15); Calculate the row IFFT according to (17), to
    obtain each C( u ′ , m ′ ,t) Obtain each B( u ′ , m ′ ,t) according to the formula
    B( u ′ , m ′ ,t)=C( u ′ , m ′ ,t)(−1 ) m ′ + u ′ − N 2 ; Calculate the column
    IFFT according to (16) to obtain A( u ′ , v ′ ,t) ; Get each h(x,z,t) according
    to (18). B. Noise Realization Method In computer graphics, the basis for noise
    generation is actually random numbers [12]. White noise is the simplest noise,
    and its generation principle is the generation of a random number. In real-life
    scenes, such as water flow and mountains, the random components in them are not
    completely independent, and their shapes tend to be fractal, containing a variety
    of details. Therefore, simple white noise cannot simulate these natural scenes
    well. In view of the shortcomings of white noise, Ken Perlin [13] proposed the
    Perlin noise algorithm. The core of the algorithm is to use the idea of interpolation
    to make the noise better simulate all things in nature with a smooth change trend
    [14]. The core idea of Perlin noise is to interpolate between two adjacent points
    through randomly generated gradients and mitigation functions, so as to achieve
    the purpose of smooth transition between points [15]. In multivariate differential
    calculus, gradient is defined as the partial derivative of a function for each
    coordinate axis, which represents the direction in which the function changes
    fastest in space, while in Perlin noise, the gradient is randomly generated. Further,
    the noise function is actually a pseudo-random function generation method, which
    has the following two characteristics: For the same input, the function has the
    same output, so it is not really random, but pseudo-random; For different inputs,
    when the variation difference is large, it will cause random variation of the
    output. For one-dimensional Perlin noise, the gradient is a random floating point
    number in the range [0,1]. For two-dimensional or three-dimensional Perlin noise,
    the directional gradients generated by points are usually used to form a random
    gradient vector set and then use Monte Carlo simulation method to selects the
    stochastic gradient vectors that meet the conditions from the set [16]. Two-dimensional
    Perlin noise generally selects some vectors in different directions in the unit
    circle, and three-dimensional Perlin noise selects some vectors in different directions
    in the three-dimensional unit sphere. In order to make the noise appear more realistic,
    Ken Perlin introduced ease curve to ease the interpolation process, which effectively
    solved the problem that adjacent noise points were obviously discontinuous during
    the linear interpolation process. The first ease curve used is the Hermite function,
    which is calculated as follows: φ(x)=−2 x 3 +3 x 2 (19) View Source Since the
    second derivative of Hermite function φ ′′ =−12x+6 is not equal to 0 at x=0 and
    x=1 , this makes their second derivatives discontinuous at adjacent lattices.
    Therefore, Ken Perlin improved on the original curve and proposed a new ease curve:
    φ(x)=6 x 5 −15 x 4 +10 x 3 (20) View Source The new ease curve is a quintic polynomial,
    and its second and first derivatives are both 0 at x=0 and x=1 Compared with the
    original curve, the resulting noise is smoother at the lattice boundaries. This
    new curve solves the problem of the continuity of the second-order derivative
    of the Hermite function, so that the noise generated by the algorithm can better
    simulate various details of natural affairs, thereby further expanding the use
    of noise in computer graphics. Two-dimensional Perlin noise generation process
    is shown in Figure 5, and the specific steps are: Define a lattice structure,
    and each lattice vertex has a pseudo-random gradient vector (actually a vector).
    For two-dimensional Perlin noise, the lattice structure is a plane grid, and for
    three-dimensional it is a cubic grid; Input a point (two-dimensional is two-dimensional
    coordinates, three-dimensional is three-dimensional coordinates, n-dimensional
    is n-dimensional coordinates), we find those lattice vertices adjacent to it (4
    in 2D, 8 in 3D, there are 2n in n dimension), calculate the distance vector from
    the point to each lattice vertex, and then do point multiplication with the gradient
    vector on the vertex respectively to obtain 4n point multiplication results; Use
    ease curve φ(x)=6 x 5 −15 x 4 +10 x 3 to calculate their weighted sums. Use the
    ease curve to calculate the ease between the input point and the adjacent lattice
    vertices, and use it as a scale factor to weight the dot product calculated in
    the previous step, and finally obtain the Perlin noise value corresponding to
    the input point through interpolation. Figure 5. Two-dimensional Perlin noise
    generation process Show All In the research of this paper, using (x, z) in the
    three-dimensional coordinate system as the input point of Perlin noise, a noise
    can be generated to perturb the water surface height value in the current coordinate,
    thereby simulating a more realistic flood scene. As shown in Figure 5, (x, z)
    represents the input point of the noise sought, and floor(x) represents the function
    of rounding down the variable x, then set x 0 =floor(x) , z 0 =floor(z) , x 1
    = x 0 +1 , z 1 = Z 0 +1 ; let Grad(i,j) be the generation function of the pseudo-random
    gradient vector, then the dot product of input point and the point of the adjacent
    lattice vertices is: g 00 =Grad( x 0, , z 0 )⋅((x,z)−( x 0 , z 0 )) (21) View
    Source g 10 =Grad( x 1 , z 0 )⋅((x,z)−( x 1 , z 0 )) (22) View Source g 01 =Grad(
    x 0, , z 1 )⋅((x,z)−( x 0 , z 1 )) (23) View Source g 11 =Grad( x 1 , z 1 )⋅((x,z)−(
    x 1 , z 1 )) (24) View Source Using φ(x)=6 x 5 −15 x 4 +10 x 3 as the ease curve,
    the proportional coefficients φ(x− x 0 ) and φ(z− z 0 ) corresponding to x and
    z can be calculated by substituting x− x 0 and z− z 0 into the ease curve respectively.
    Let α= g 00 +( g 10 − g 00 )⋅φ(x− x 0 ) (25) View Source β= g 01 +( g 11 − g 01
    )⋅φ(x− x 0 ) (26) View Source Then the final calculation formula of two-dimensional
    Perlin noise based on point (x, z) is: Noise perlin (x,z)=α+(β−α)⋅φ(z− z 0 ) (27)
    View Source C. Realization of Water Wave Simulation Algorithm The basic idea of
    the FFT simulation algorithm under Perlin noise perturbation is to superimpose
    the water surface height model generated by the FFT algorithm with the Perlin
    noise to generate a new water surface height map. The core of the FFT to generate
    the water surface model is to generate a number of sinusoids through the spectrum,
    and after the accumulation, the final water surface waveform is obtained. However,
    due to the periodicity of the sinusoidal function, the wave surface of the flood
    model finally formed by the FFT algorithm is relatively stable, symmetrical and
    periodic, so it cannot well simulate the real scene with irregular flood water.
    On the other hand, the fluctuation of the flood water wave surface will have a
    certain impact on the nearby waveforms. Simple white noise is too random and non-directional,
    and cannot simulate the details of the interaction of water surface fluctuations.
    Perlin noise, a kind of lattice-based gradient noise, can solve this problem very
    well. For a given input point (x, z), use the pseudo-random vector of the adjacent
    four integer lattice points to do a dot product with the distance vector of that
    point. The point multiplication result obtained is smoothed by using the easing
    curve, that is, interpolating, so as to construct a two-dimensional noise wave
    model with smooth and easing. And the FFT flood simulation algorithm based on
    Perlin noise perturbation is to use the generated two-dimensional Perlin noise
    as the perturbation in the direction y of the water surface model generated by
    (x, z) in the three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system XYZ, and perturb the
    height of each point, thereby generates new water surface height field to add
    rich detail to flood surface fluctuations. The calculation formula of FFT water
    surface height and the calculation formula of two-dimensional Perlin noise have
    been deduced above, which are (7) and (27) respectively. The formula for calculating
    the water surface height after Perlin noise perturbation is: H(x,z,t)=h(x,z,t)+
    Noise perlin (x,z) (28) View Source SECTION V. Experimental Results and Analysis
    In this paper, several common water modeling algorithms in the application of
    3D flood visualization under the same operating environment are compared with
    the FFT flood simulation algorithm based on Perlin noise perturbation proposed
    in this paper. The experimental effect diagram of water body is shown below, and
    the experimental setting is shown in Table 1. A. Experimental Environment TABLE
    I Experimental Environment Setting B. Model Presentation Figure 6 is a water body
    model constructed by simulating the wave surface of a sine wave. It can be seen
    from the experimental effect diagram that the peak of the water surface constructed
    by the sine wave is round and periodic, which is more suitable for simulating
    a calm water surface. Figure 6. Water wave simulation model based on sine wave
    Show All Figure 7 is a water body model constructed by simulating the wave surface
    of Gerstner wave. Gerstner wave is an improved method of sine wave. It can be
    seen from the experimental renderings that although the peak of the water surface
    model constructed by Gerstner is sharp, it does not change its periodicity. Therefore,
    it cannot effectively simulate the real scene with irregular flood wave surface.
    Figure 7. Gerstner wave simulates water surface Show All Figure 8 shows the water
    body model constructed by the FFT algorithm based on Perlin perturbation proposed
    in this paper. It can be seen from the experimental results that the algorithm
    proposed in this paper has sharper and more complex water surface crests than
    sine waves and Gerstner waves in line with the real scene of the flood. Figure
    8. FFT simulated water surface under Perlin noise perturbation Show All Figure
    9 is a comparison diagram of the effect of the original FFT algorithm and the
    water model constructed by the FFT algorithm based on Perlin noise perturbation
    proposed in this paper. Figure 9. Comparison of modeling effects Show All From
    the Figure 9, that the water wave surface of the FFT algorithm after adding Perlin
    noise perturbation is more irregular. Because the Perlin noise can better simulate
    the effect of the interaction between flood waves, the improved model can make
    the modeled water body more conform to the laws of nature, thereby effectively
    improving the similarity between the virtual modeling water model and the real
    flood. It can be concluded from the above experiments that the FFT flood simulation
    algorithm based on Perlin noise perturbation proposed in this paper can well simulate
    the real characteristics of floods in 3D scenes, and can greatly improve the authenticity
    of flood virtual simulation in 3D flood visualization system. SECTION VI. Conclusion
    In this paper, through the analysis and derivation of traditional Fourier transform,
    FFT algorithm and Perlin noise algorithm, a FFT flood simulation based on Perlin
    noise perturbation is proposed. The method combines the fast Fourier water body
    model and Perlin noise algorithm. Under the premise of taking full advantage of
    the high real-time water modeling of FFT algorithm, the method effectively simulates
    the specific details of water ripples with the smooth characteristics of Perlin
    noise, and realizes the authenticity of flood water modeling. Applying this method
    to the flood visualization system can more truly simulate the process of flood
    routing and improve the authenticity and timeliness of flood routing simulation.
    It is hoped that the work of this paper can provide some help for flood control.

  description: Collaborative systems with multiple robots strategies are frequently
    cited as promising solutions to increase efficiency and system resilience in the
    agricultural area, where robotics is anticipated to play a significant role. Swarm
    robotics, one of the multi-robot techniques, emphasizes factors like adaptability,
    scalability, and resilience in completing complicated tasks and is seen to be
    particularly useful for precision farming and large-scale agricultural applications.
    This paper discusses the agri-bot as a cutting-edge technique for monitoring the
    quality of crops and watering the crops with the least amount of work and labor,
    making it a useful machine. Also IoRT (Internet of Robotic Things) is used among
    four robots for swarm robotics. The proposed design and its implementation are
    discussed in the paper for state-of-the-art swarm-based agriculture. The robots
    designed with sensors and control mechanism will monitor the field and using IoT
    will transfer the data to cloud. The synchronizing robot will acts as gateway
    for other robots. It will receive commands from server and all the robots will
    act accordingly to complete the task. So this work implements the swarm robotics
    technology and hence will have future scope in many other critical applications
    like surveillance, medicine, and food delivery sentinel swarm robotics for defense
    applications as well.

    Collaborative systems with multiple robots strategies are frequently cited as
    promising solutions to increase efficiency and system resilience in the agricultural
    area, where robotics is anticipated to play a significant role. Swarm robotics,
    one of the multi-robot techniques, emphasizes factors like adaptability, scalability,
    and resilience in completing complicated tasks and is seen to be particularly
    useful for precision farming and large-scale agricultural applications. This paper
    discusses the agri-bot as a cutting-edge technique for monitoring the quality
    of crops and watering the crops with the least amount of work and labor, making
    it a useful machine. Also IoRT (Internet of Robotic Things) is used among four
    robots for swarm robotics. The proposed design and its implementation are discussed
    in the paper for state-of-the-art swarm-based agriculture. The robots designed
    with sensors and control mechanism will monitor the field and using IoT will transfer
    the data to cloud. The synchronizing robot will acts as gateway for other robots.
    It will receive commands from server and all the robots will act accordingly to
    complete the task. So this work implements the swarm robotics technology and hence
    will have future scope in many other critical applications like surveillance,
    medicine, and food delivery sentinel swarm robotics for defense applications as
    well. Keywords Multisensory robot Swarm robotics Agriculture IoRT Access provided

    Chapter © 2023 1 Introduction In India, agricultural sector problems and their
    solutions affect about 80% of total population. Multiple sensors-based movable
    multifunctional robot can be used for deciding the next crop cultivation in the
    field, soil quality monitoring, crop health monitoring, and based on these data
    should be able to make intelligent decisions. Also, if more than one such robot
    will work in a swarm, then will be called as swarm robotics (Fig. 1). Fig. 1 Swarm
    robotics from https://makezine.com/article/science/swarm-farming-explained/ Full
    size image Here the robots work as distributed with each robot having its own
    power and capability and also can work by coordinating among themselves. The intelligent
    swarm robotics algorithms are derived from the natural phenomenon of a bird swarm,
    fish swarm, ant swarm, etc., for carrying out any task. In the initial phase,
    the synchronization among swarm bots is to be established. In farming, the multisensory
    swarm robots are used for plowing, sprinkling fertilizers, crop monitoring, soil
    monitoring, and hence for countless applications. This paper explores the fundamental
    requirements of the users in the background research section. The work describes
    the design method followed to develop a simple, low-cost system for tracking agricultural
    environmental data through swarm robots. The second section of paper gives literature
    survey and motivation, third section discusses the objectives and problem statements,
    fourth section discusses the work flow and implementation, and fifth section discusses
    the results and final prototype model. 2 Literature Survey In [1] swarm intelligence
    and its use in swarm robotics is discussed. Due to the flexible, durable, decentralized,
    and self-organized nature of critical thinking systems, swarm robotics presents
    an exciting alternative to conventional approaches to robotics. Swarm Intelligence
    includes Control Approach, Self-assembly robots, Object clustering, swarm guided
    route, self-development, & Mechanism. In [2], the status of the current trends
    and implementation of agricultural and autonomous systems and outline of the potential
    for future applications are discussed. Three main teams of field operations are
    crop institution, plant care, and selective harvesting. The Arduino Uno, agri-bot,
    android application, and Bluetooth are some of the major characteristics of paper.
    In [3], an overview of the issues of swarm robotics and its application in various
    fields: swarm robotics advantages, swarm robotics applications, and swarm robotics
    issues are discussed. In [4], author explains how to set up a farming robot that
    can move automatically through a field while also spying on its surroundings with
    a camera and sending the information to a computer via Wi-Fi network, Arduino,
    ultrasonic sensor, agri-bot, android application, IR sensor, obstacle detection,
    IP webcam, Wi-Fi. In [5], author discusses the swarm robotics research and identifies
    precision agriculture, infrastructure inspection and maintenance, defense, space
    missions, entertainment, and precision medicine as the application fields that
    will most likely drive the science and technology of robot swarms intelligence.
    In [6], the swarm behavior of the social insects led to development of swarm robot
    technology. With the help of the sensors, we can avoid the obstacles. The prototype
    of robots consists of Arduino Uno which control unit for both main robot and follower
    robot, Arduino Uno ATMEGA328P, Transceiver pair NRF24L01, Swarm. In [7], author
    offers a thorough analysis of ground-based agricultural robotic systems, applications,
    and enabling technology, with a focus on harvesting in particular. The majority
    of work focuses on the difficulties in developing crop recognition and field navigation
    by vision. Regular tasks include weeding, seed sowing, yield calculation, water
    inspection, and health monitoring. Author discusses in [8], robotic vehicle as
    agricultural machine that uses swarm intelligence to perform tasks. In [9], an
    approach to collective robotics that takes inspiration from the self-organized
    behaviors of social animals is discussed. References [10,11,12] provide basic
    knowledge about the swarm robotic system, system-level properties, characteristics,
    mechanisms, problems, and research directions. Reference [13] gives an overview
    of recent developments in agricultural robotics, with a focus on those that use
    high-tech sensors, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and simulation environments
    for (i) targeted weed control and spraying, (ii) field scouting and data collection,
    and (iii) automated harvesting. [14] describes the use of this robotic system
    as one of the significant advancements in this generation of robotics and how
    it will revolutionize the farming industry. The major focus of this summary is
    on how this fully autonomous system is used for tasks like harvesting, watering,
    scouting, and plowing. In [15], the following is an author’s discussion of swarm
    robotics. Swarm intelligence and robotics are the sources of inspiration for the
    relatively new field of swarm robotics. It results from the integration of multi
    robotics with swarm intelligence approaches. Despite numerous planned studies,
    there is still a long way to go before they may be used in real life. An overview
    of swarm robotics is provided in the current study to help readers comprehend
    this multi-robot domain research and to make clear the broad themes that are being
    addressed in this area. The sections offered in this paper might easily direct
    those who are just starting to get interested in this area, i.e., swarm robotics
    applications, simulators, and classification of swarm robotics issues. 2.1 Motivation
    The study of swarm robotics focuses on how many physically embodied agents can
    be produced, and how this may be done in a way that a desired collective action
    emerges from the local interactions of the agents and their environment. The operation
    of a swarm robotic system should exhibit three functional properties. Robustness—A
    number of factors is responsible for the robustness of the operation. First, the
    absence of one robot may be promptly replaced by another. Second, because there
    are many different parts of the robot working together, it is unlikely that one
    of them would stop working. Third, all swarms are rather straightforward, which
    lessens the likelihood that they will fail. Fourth, the swarm is resilient to
    local environmental disturbances because sensing is dispersed across it. Flexibility—It
    helps the system to tackle different problems with the coordination of an individual
    swarm. With this property, the swarm robotic system works very fast to carry large
    prey through the utilization of different coordination strategies. Scalability—The
    robot should be able to handle a variety of group sizes and carry a sizable number
    of individuals without interfering with other operations. This refers to the coordination
    techniques and processes that must be created for swarm systems to guarantee swarm
    operation at various swarm sizes. 2.2 Features Task enablement: Multiple robots
    can do certain tasks that are impossible for the single robot. Improved performance:
    If tasks can be decomposable, then by using parallelism, groups of robots can
    make tasks to be performed more efficiently. Fault tolerance: Under certain conditions,
    the failure of a single robot within a group does not imply that the given task
    cannot be accomplished, thanks to other one. Distributed action: The group of
    robots can actuate in various places at the same time. Communication: The robots
    have to support wireless communication which helps to avoid the plugging cables
    to the robots. Physical interaction: The robots should be able to physically interact
    with each other and the environment for self-assembly construction. 3 Problem
    Statement Farmers are seeking for ways to lessen their burden and improve the
    productivity of their fields. Data gathering is the main force behind the need
    for labor. In order to make well-informed decisions that will increase the productivity
    of their farm, farmers require data. Our project is built on the work of a previous
    MQP team to develop an IOT SWARM (stands for self-assembling wireless autonomous
    reconfigurable modules) agriculture system that would allow farmers to monitor
    environmental conditions in their fields with sensor nodes and manage and maintain
    the nodes using autonomous rovers. This system would deal with the socioeconomic
    difficulties that farmers have. The battery-powered nodes measure the following
    variables to provide data on the agronomic conditions in the fields: temperature,
    humidity, light intensity, and air quality. Farmers would be able to evaluate
    the state of their farms precisely and affordably. It supports the farmer’s ability
    to keep an eye on field conditions and make well-informed decisions to boost output,
    cut expenses, and preserve the environment. 3.1 Objectives To develop four robots
    in swarm architecture for precision agriculture. To use the swarm robots in the
    field for obtaining plow, irrigation, seed sowing, harvesting, and soil moistening.
    Based on the data available on one synchronizing BOT, apply intelligent algorithms
    for appropriate action. Swarm robotics implies that the instructions we provide
    to the one robot will be followed by the other robots. We have four robots in
    our project in distributed architecture. 3.2 Model Implementation The proposed
    swarm robotic design, the robots of the swarm should be autonomous bodies to sense
    the field and should be able to send the data to the server. The autonomous robot
    must coordinate and collaborate to complete the task efficiently like soil monitoring
    and irrigation, or harvesting a field, etc. The design of single robot for precision
    agriculture is shown as in Figs. 2 and 3. Fig. 2 Circuit diagram of robot Full
    size image Fig. 3 Prototype model of multisensory multifunctional robot Full size
    image 3.3 Process of Monitoring Temperature Start the application. Connect the
    one and slave robots with the cloud where readings are visible. If the temperature
    is below 10 ℃, then seed fails to grow, we need to turn ON the water pump and
    when above 10 ℃ it turns OFF. If the temperature is in between 20 and 32 ℃ the
    crop will grow, so we need to plow the field after turning it OFF and seeding
    ON in the field. If the temperature is more than 32 ℃ in the field, then the crop
    needs some amount of water, so turn ON the water pump and give sufficient water
    to the crop. If the temperature is remaining more than 32 ℃ the crop is damaged
    and harvesting cutter is ON to remove the damaged crop from the field. Store the
    data automatically on cloud. Stop the app and shows the result on cloud. 3.4 Monitoring
    Soil Moisture Start the Blynk Application. Connect the robots to the Blynk or
    cloud. Now, robot starts working and soil moisture data reading shows on Blynk
    app. If the soil moisture of field is below 30% then crop does not grow or becomes
    damage, crop field needs water, so pump is ON and OFF after pumping when the soil
    moisture is up to 30%. If the soil moisture of the crop is in between, it remains
    30–50%, then crop grows faster after that harvesting cutter is ON for cutting
    the crop. If the soil moisture is more than 50% crop is damaged, then harvesting
    cutter is ON and OFF after a time to cutting damage crop. Stop the Blynk application
    after sensing soil moisture in the whole field and store the data on cloud. Blynk
    cloud shows the data of the fields on mobile screen or presenting all data of
    soil moisture in excel sheet format in percentage. 3.5 Plow We use a stand for
    plow or that stands are also called a type of thing for plowing the field. It
    is connected through the servo motor which is connected through the motor and
    controlled by the Arduino. When we give or press the plow button ON then the one
    robot starts to plow after some nano seconds, other slave robots take this command
    to the same function. We use servomotor for take up and down plow stand. 3.6 Seeding
    In this function, we use a servo motor (2), we call servo motor 2 which is used
    for seeding function. This servo motor is also connected to motor driver to drive
    this motor. Use servo motor for seeding purpose, the box is rotated in up and
    down direction. We press seed ON button in Blynk App then Arduino shows this operation.
    3.7 Temperature and Soil Moisture Sensing We use temperature and soil moisture
    sensor to check the quality of crop. These sensors are connected to servo motor
    which is derived by motor drive or performed by Arduino. This servo motor is connected
    from motor driver which drives the direction of sensor up and down. We press ON
    button of the temperature or soil moisture sensor, then it performs the operation
    and stores the reading in the Blynk App. 3.8 Water Pumping We use water pump that
    is connected through Arduino or motor driver for water pumping in the field. When
    we give command through Blynk App then Arduino performs the task. As, we press
    pump button ON, the irrigation starts and if we again press the same button, then
    pump is OFF. 3.9 Harvesting We use DC geared motor which is connected through
    motor driver. We can connect a blade on DC geared motor for cutting the crops.
    When we push ON button of cutter on the Blynk App then Arduino takes command and
    performs this operation. After completing this task, we press OFF button to stop
    harvesting process. 3.10 Humidity Sensing We use DHT sensor for sensing the humidity.
    When we press ON button for humidity sensing, it starts sensing. This sensor is
    connected through Arduino. Arduino UNO performs this operation wisely. It takes
    reading of humidity and stores in Blynk App from where it appears on the mobile
    screen. After sensing the humidity, we press OFF button to stop the operation.
    4 Working of SWARM Agriculture System Firstly, we download Blynk application from
    Play Store in mobile. Make necessary configuration using SSID network and password
    and make a layout of remote and provide ON and OFF buttons with operation name
    and direction buttons. Then connect the One Robot first using the SPOT network
    to control the movements. In the One Robot we have the uses, node MCU, RF module,
    servo motor, DC geared motors, Arduino UNO board, motor drivers, step down buck
    converter and OP Amp for soil moisture sensors. The same components are used for
    the other three slave robots. Firstly, upload the required code in node MCU and
    now connect the RF transmitter with the node MCU. Using Radio Frequency module
    (RF module), we can transmit and receive the radio signal between two devices
    or even more than two devices that maintains the coordination between robots and
    to provide the communication between remote control and actual robots. Then node
    MCU ESP: 8266 has Wi-Fi module that can be connected to our smartphone/smart devices
    by using Blynk Application which is a big IOT platform and it helps to control
    the robots remotely. Then Arduino UNO board is connected with node MCU as well
    as RF transmitter in the One Robot and RF receiver in the slave robots. It is
    used to control robot motors and sensors by using embedded C programming in the
    Arduino UNO board. The motor board controls the motors and stores the reading
    and decides how to operate all robots. The whole process is controlled by a microcontroller.
    Then we use two motor drivers in the one robot or other slave robots to control
    all the motors and maintain speed and direction at the same time according to
    Arduino coding In one robot and slave robots, we have used three servo motors
    and four DC geared motors, DC geared motors are capable of high starting torque.
    We have used two sensors, DTH (for measuring the temperature and humidity) and
    soil moisture sensor (for measuring the moisture of the soil). OP Amp for soil
    moisture sensor is used in one robot or slave robots to convert the incoming analog
    signal from soil probe to digital. Step down buck converter is used to maintain
    power supply of 3A and voltage of motors. Then operations are performed by the
    one robot and slave robots—harvesting, pumping, soil moisture sensing, seeding,
    plowing, temperature, and humidity sensing. In our project we have four robots,
    one robot is used for sending the data to server and issuing commands to other
    three robots, swarm robotics means the instruction we give to the one robot will
    be followed by other robot (Fig. 4). Fig. 4 Proposed swarm robotics design for
    agriculture Full size image 5 Workflow of the Prototype Model See Fig. 5. Fig.
    5 Flowchart Full size image 6 Results The objective of this work was to design
    the swarm robotic system for agriculture. This system works well with three slave
    robots and one robot in the field. Due to the parallel operation of numerous robots
    and their cooperation, the application of swarm intelligence principles to agricultural
    robotics has the potential to result in innovation. The one robot gets the sensing
    parameters from slave robots visiting and monitoring the field. On receiving the
    data, the one robot issues commands to slave robot for seeding, harvesting, and
    irrigation. The datasheet mentioned below has shown the reading of temperature
    and soil moisture which helps to operate the various operations like plowing,
    seeding, water pumping, and harvesting. It performs all the functions and gives
    the result accordingly. It starts with one robot then followed by other three
    slave robots as far as the process goes on, in the field. The fully developed
    robots are shown in Fig. 6 (Table 1). Fig. 6 a Multisensory multifunctional robots
    in field. b Multisensory multifunctional robots in field Full size image Table
    1 Readings Full size table 7 Conclusion and Future Scope A multi-purpose agricultural
    robot that can mow, seed, plow, and sprinkle water has been successfully tested
    and implemented. The key conclusion of this study is that the majority of these
    self-government-supporting frameworks are more adaptable than traditional frameworks.
    Multifunctional horticulture robot advantages include a decrease of human involvement,
    assurance of a sufficient water supply, and effective resource use. In the future,
    similar activities will be completed without the need for a human supervisor due
    to the use of ultrasonic sensors and cameras to monitor things like soil quality,
    the area the robot is guarding, and leveling. The data collected from the robots
    for different parameters will be uploaded on the cloud for different applications.
    Commands will be issued by One Robot for the respective function. Also the data
    collected on the server will be analyzed using machine learning for intelligent
    decisions regarding soil quality, fertilizers requirement, harvesting of crop,
    irrigation, etc. So the system will be smart in future with further application
    of machine learning algorithms. References Kharje S, Wahaj SM, Fatma SS, Prof.

  description: Due to the impact of climate change on agriculture and the emergence

    IA = 0.98, and MBE = −0.02). This article focuses on case studies from corn, blueberry,
    and tomato fields in Michigan, USA. In the corn and blueberry fields, the evaluation
    of irrigation practices of farmer's using an IoT-based sensor technology was considered.
    In the tomato field, a demonstration of automation irrigation was conducted. Overirrigation
    was observed using the IoT-based sensor station in some fields that have sandy
    soil and use a drip irrigation system. In the blueberry demonstration field, the
    total yield per plant (p = 0.025) and 50-berry weights (p = 0.013) were found
    to be higher with the recommended irrigation management than the farmer's existing
    field. In the tomato demonstration field, there were no statistical differences
    in the number of marketable tomatoes (p = 0.382) and their weights (p = 0.756)
    between the farmer's existing method and the recommended irrigation strategy.
    However, 30% less water was applied to the recommended irrigation strategy plot.
    Thus, the result showed that the IoT-based sensor irrigation strategy can save
    up to 30% on irrigation while maintaining the same yields and quality of the product.

    for centuries and plays a significant role in developing economies worldwide.
    Irrigation is the process of supplying water to the crops using an artificial
    means to provide moisture, which helps in the growth and produces higher yields
    in crops. It is particularly important in regions with low precipitation and limited
    water resources. Irrigation also significantly impacts local rural economies by
    affecting the production of crops, creating jobs, increasing carbon sequestration,
    and boosting economic growth. Climate change poses a threat to agriculture. Erratic
    and unpredictable precipitation patterns, rising global average temperatures,
    and water scarcity can compromise food security (Rosa, 2022). Crop health is affected
    by rainfall trends, such as wetter springs, and drier summers with temperature
    anomalies, such as cold or heat waves (Alam et al., 2021). These flooding and
    drought events, without precision irrigation, can decrease the yield and quality
    of the product. In addition to these precipitation changes, average global temperatures
    are expected to increase by around 2°C each year until the year 2100. Higher temperatures
    lead to alterations in evapotranspiration (ET) and weed growth, affect pollination,
    and decrease photosynthesis rate, source-sink relationship, and crop duration,
    all of which can affect plant health and productivity (Malhi et al., 2021). Precision
    irrigation management practices have the potential to increase water use efficiency
    while minimizing the effects of climate change on farms. Irrigation scheduling
    is a well-established strategy to manage crop water needs throughout the growing
    season. This method involves monitoring the water requirements of crops and determining
    whether the existing soil moisture and any additional water from precipitation
    and irrigation can fulfill them. Irrigation scheduling also considers economic
    and environmental variables. Every day, farmers face the challenge of making decisions
    that balance the cost of applying water (labor and energy) against the goal of
    achieving a high yield, enhanced crop quality, and the efficient use of water
    resources. Several types of irrigation scheduling have been demonstrated in the
    past, including ET-, soil moisture-, and artificial intelligence (AI)-based irrigation
    scheduling (Aguilar et al., 2015; Goap et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2020; Alibabaei
    et al., 2021; Dong, 2023; Kelley et al., 2023). ET-based irrigation scheduling
    is a method of irrigating a crop using daily reference ET, particular crop coefficient
    (Kc) value, and the amount of precipitation. Kc is determined by crop types and
    crop growth stage. This method has been shown to save water by up to 61% compared
    to the conventional irrigation application method (Simić et al., 2023). Soil moisture
    sensor-based irrigation scheduling utilizes soil moisture sensors to estimate
    soil moisture content in the root zone to ensure optimal moisture levels for crops
    and avoid overirrigation. Typically, soil moisture sensors are installed at multiple
    depths in the root zone to understand the soil moisture levels at different depths
    comprehensively. The changes in soil moisture at different depths help to estimate
    the root growth. Many types of soil moisture sensors are available, including
    tensiometers, capacitance sensors, time domain reflectometry (TDR) sensors, and
    frequency domain reflectometry (FDR) sensors. A tensiometer is a soil water tension
    measuring tool comprised of a porous ceramic cup with a water-filled tube working
    on the capillary action principle, which measures the soil matric potential expressing
    soil water energy. Capacitance sensors measure soil dielectric constants that
    differ for different moisture regimes, which provide real-time data for precise
    irrigation management (Smajstrla and Harrison, 2023). TDR is an approach that
    works on the principles of sending an electromagnetic pulse to the soil, and the
    travel time of the pulse is directly related to the soil moisture content, and
    it provides continuous soil moisture data across different depths, which helps
    in understanding efficient irrigation management (He et al., 2021). In addition
    to these sensors, FDR is another technique based on electromagnetic wave reflections
    that send high-frequency waves to the soil for measuring dielectric properties,
    which determines the soil moisture for precision irrigation management (Choi et
    al., 2016). Previously, this soil moisture sensor-based irrigation scheduling
    helped to save water by up to 60% compared to conventional irrigation methods
    (Muñoz-Carpena et al., 2005; Grabow et al., 2013; Millán et al., 2019). A study
    conducted by Boltana et al. (2023) showed that the soil moisture sensor-based
    method saved 18% of irrigation water compared to the ET-based method in tomato
    fields (Boltana et al., 2023). Moreover, the sensor-based irrigation method increased
    water use efficiency in soybean and potato fields by 49% and 16%, respectively
    (Wood et al., 2020; Dong et al., 2023). The AI-based irrigation scheduling analyzes
    multiple input data, such as soil moisture, soil temperature, air temperature,
    relative humidity, plant canopy temperature, crop type, crop growth stage, and
    yield data, to develop AI logarithms. Machine learning, deep learning, and reinforcement
    learning techniques are typically used for developing algorithms. These algorithms
    provide predictive analytics about optimum irrigation volume, time and frequency
    of irrigation, and yield data. These data can be used for the long-term planning
    of water usage based on weather forecasts and provide predictive measures for
    proactive interventions. This AI-based irrigation scheduling has been shown to
    improve the efficiency of water use for irrigation by up to 50% (Mohammad et al.,
    2013; Zia et al., 2021) and save the usage of water by 59% (Jamroen et al., 2020)
    compared to the industry standard method. Of those methods discussed, weather-
    and soil moisture-based irrigation scheduling are the most common methods, as
    they are relatively cheap, more practical, and easier to use. While the weather-based
    irrigation scheduling method uses reference ET and Kc to determine when and how
    much to irrigate, the soil moisture-based irrigation scheduling method utilizes
    actual in-field soil moisture data using sensors to estimate the current soil
    water available and determine the irrigation decision. Soil moisture sensors can
    also be used for monitoring the spatial variation of soil moisture within the
    fields, thus allowing precise irrigation management. Recently, soil moisture sensor
    adoption in agriculture in the United States is only 12% (as of 2020) (Kukal et
    al., 2020). To increase this adoption rate, systems should be more cost-effective
    and easier to use (Dong, 2023). Furthermore, farmers need to be more educated
    on how they work to increase the trust in using them. The cost, difficulty to
    use, and trust are the major challenges for adopting the technology by farmers.
    Therefore, affordable and easy-to-use technology is needed to increase the its
    adoption. In addition, the demonstration of the technology in agricultural fields
    to show the potential use in improving the efficiency of irrigation water use
    is needed. In this study, we propose to develop an affordable and easy-to-use
    sensor monitoring system for farmers to improve irrigation management. We implement
    a low-cost sensor monitoring system (LOCOMOS) to measure soil moisture at multiple
    depths and use the data to provide irrigation recommendations. This article focuses
    on case studies using LOCOMOS in corn, blueberry, and tomato fields. 2 Methodology
    LOCOMOS, which was developed by Michigan State University Irrigation Lab, was
    used in this study. LOCOMOS is an IoT-based sensor monitoring system that measures
    in-field soil and environmental conditions. The collected data were sent to the
    IoT cloud web server, from which irrigation recommendations were provided. 2.1
    An IoT-based sensor monitoring system A LOCOMOS system can continuously measure
    soil moisture levels at multiple depths, leaf wetness duration, air temperature,
    relative humidity, and precipitation. The data were then sent to a LOCOMOS IoT
    website (https://www.locomos1.com) to display the recommended irrigation timing
    and amount, the location of the sensor system, the raw sensor data, and the switch
    to turn irrigation on and off. The dashboard on the LOCOMOS IoT website was updated
    every 15 min, allowing the user to observe and make timely farm management decisions.
    An SD card module was utilized for storing and backing up the sensor data locally.
    LOCOMOS is powered by a 12V 7A battery, a 12V solar panel, and a solar battery
    charging controller. Email and Text message alert systems were set up through
    the IoT website. For example, a user could receive an email and text message when
    the soil water available level is at 50% for growing corn. SoilWatch 10, the soil
    moisture sensors, manufactured by Pino-Tech (Stargard, Poland), were utilized
    for measuring soil moisture levels. SoilWatch 10 is a relatively cheaper sensor
    and has provided reliable soil moisture measurement. PHYTOS 31 Leaf Wetness Sensor,
    manufactured by METER Group (Pullmen, WA, USA), was utilized to record the duration
    of leaf wetness. An SHT30 temperature and humidity sensor, manufactured by Sensirion
    (Chicago, IL, USA), was utilized for measuring the air temperature and relative
    humidity. The accuracy tolerance for air temperature and relative humidity were
    ± 0.3°C and ± 3%, respectively. A rain gauge, manufactured by Davis Instruments
    (Hayward, CA, USA), was utilized for measuring the precipitation. The rain gauge
    measured every 0.02 cm increment. Hunter ICV valves with DC latching solenoids
    were connected to the microcontroller to turn the valve on and off. Figure 1 shows
    a block diagram of the LOCOMOS system. figure 1 Figure 1. A block diagram for
    the LOCOMOS system. The LOCOMOS smartphone application (LOCOMOS APP) is an easy-to-use
    app designed for farmers to manage irrigation for their crops. The LOCOMOS APP
    connects to the LOCOMOS IoT server to visualize the sensor data on the app. Each
    user will be verified using a digital ocean server (Figure 2). Figure 3 shows
    the pages of the LOCOMOS APP. To access the app, existing users can log in using
    their registered email ID and password. New users can sign up using their email
    ID and a unique invitation code, which is provided by the server. Once logged
    in, a list of sensor devices will be displayed. Each device contains its GPS coordinates
    and provides real-time available soil water (%) and maximum recommended irrigation
    amount. In addition, the LOCOMOS APP gathers ET and precipitation information
    from the Michigan State University Enviroweather Network. Users can either push
    the “Use My Location” button or select the closest weather station to their field
    to observe the ET and precipitation data. In addition, the map page allows users
    to visualize the precise locations of all deployed sensors on a map. This bird''s-eye
    view offers a comprehensive overview of users'' farmlands, making it easier to
    identify the location of each sensor. figure 2 Figure 2. An overview of the LOCOMOS

    irrigation amount, (E) Weather information from MSU Enviroweather, and (F) LOCOMOS
    devices on the map. 2.2 Soil moisture sensor calibration The calibration of soil
    moisture sensors to specific soil types was critical as the accuracy could be
    varied. A laboratory experiment was conducted to calibrate the SoilWatch 10 soil
    moisture sensors and evaluate their performances in two soil types. The soil types,
    including sand and loamy sand, were used in this laboratory experiment. Two 144-L
    size polypropylene containers (80 × 41 × 35 cm) were used. The volumetric water
    content (VWC) analysis was performed six times using a 61-cm3 size soil ring during
    this laboratory experiment. Detailed information on the procedure of the sensor
    calibration can be found in Smajstrla et al.''s study (Smajstrla and Harrison,
    2023). 2.3 Soil moisture sensor-based irrigation recommendation model The soil
    moisture sensor-based irrigation recommendation was estimated using the field
    capacity of soil and current soil moisture content using soil moisture sensors.
    The irrigation recommendation was calculated by finding the difference between
    the field capacity of the soil and the current soil moisture content. This recommendation
    was the maximum amount of irrigation that could be applied without water being
    lost through deep percolation beyond the root zone. The equation of soil moisture
    sensor-based irrigation recommendation is shown in Equation (1). An assumption
    was made that the volumetric soil water content for its representative soil layer
    is uniform and has the same moisture level. I R = ( F C L a y e r i -  θ v L a
    y e r i ) * D L a y e r i     ( 1 ) where IR is the maximum irrigation recommendation
    (cm), FCLayeri is the field capacity of the layer i soil depth (cm/cm), DLayeri
    is the representative layer i soil depth (cm), and θvLayeri is the volumetric
    soil water content of the layer i soil depth (cm3/cm3). 2.4 Statistical analysis
    The performance of the soil moisture sensors was evaluated using root mean squared
    error (RMSE), index of agreement (IA), and mean bias error (MBE). RMSE measures
    the difference between sensor values and soil sample values and is defined in
    Equation (2). The index of agreement was proposed by Willmott (1981), as defined
    in Equation (3). MBE is defined in Equation (4). R M S E = 1 N ∑ i = 1 N ( M i
    - P i ) 2     ( 2 ) I A = 1 - ∑ i = 1 N ( M i - P i ) 2 ∑ i = 1 N ( | P i - M
    ¯ | + | M i - M ¯ | ) 2     ( 3 ) M B E = 1 N ∑ i = 1 N ( P i − M i )     ( 4
    ) where N is the sample size, M is the measured (soil sampling) value, P is the
    predicted (sensor measurement) value, and is the average measured value. The units
    for RMSE and MBE are VWC (cm3/cm3), and IA is dimensionless. A range of IA lies
    between 0 and 1, and a value of 0 indicates no agreement between the measured
    and predicted values. A value of 1 indicates a perfect fit between the observed
    and predicted values. The higher value of IA indicates better agreement between
    observed and predicted values. Hignett and Evett (2008) revealed that the sensor
    measurement accuracy for most agricultural applications needs to be <0.02 cm3/cm3.
    Varble and Chávez (2011) and Dong et al. (2020) reported that the criteria for
    MBE and RMSE were ±0.02 cm3/cm3 and <0.035 cm3/cm3, respectively. Therefore, this
    study evaluated the sensor performance using the following criteria: MBE ± 0.02
    cm3/cm3 and RMSE < 0.035 cm3/cm3. 2.5 LOCOMOS field demonstration—Irrigation practice
    evaluation Once the sensors were calibrated and evaluated, LOCOMOS was deployed
    in irrigated fields in Michigan farmlands to evaluate the existing farmer''s irrigation
    practices. Irrigated corn and blueberry fields were evaluated. The demonstration
    irrigated corn field was located in Manchester, Michigan, USA. A commercial corn
    was cultivated in this field and was irrigated with 20–28 cm of water and 224
    kg/ha of nitrogen was applied. The commercial corn fields were irrigated using
    a center pivot irrigation system. The second demonstration field was located in
    West Olive, Michigan, USA. The field size was approximately 20 acres, and blueberries
    were cultivated in it. These blueberry fields were irrigated using a surface double-drip
    line system. Soil samples were collected to test the soil texture. The physical
    properties of the soils at different depths are shown in Table 1. The soils in
    these fields were mostly sandy soil, such as loamy sand and sandy loam, which
    were the common soil types in irrigated fields in Michigan. Figure 4 shows installed
    LOCOMOS in the irrigated corn and blueberry fields in Michigan, USA. Corn roots
    typically grow up to 90 cm in this demonstration field. Thus, the soil moisture
    sensors were installed at 15, 60, and 90 cm in the irrigated corn field. In the
    irrigated blueberry field, the sensors were installed at 15, 30, 45, and 60 cm.
    All data loggers were programmed to record soil moisture measurements every 30
    min. The soil samples were collected three times during this monitoring period.
    These samples were analyzed for texture and volumetric water content. The VWC
    from the soil samples was utilized for testing the accuracy of the sensors. table

    4 Figure 4. LOCOMOS stations installed in an irrigated corn field in Manchester,
    MI, USA (left) and an irrigated blueberry field in West Olive, MI, USA (right).
    2.6 LOCOMOS field demonstration—automation irrigation Automation irrigation using
    LOCOMOS was demonstrated in a tomato field in Hart, Michigan, USA. The 9V DC solenoid
    valves with Hunter''s ICV valves were utilized to control irrigation. Fresh tomatoes
    were cultivated in this field, and plastic mulch was used to maintain the soil
    moisture and keep the weeds out. Figure 5 shows the experimental setup for this
    tomato field. This tomato field is irrigated with a surface single drip line system.
    Two irrigation strategies, namely, the farmer''s existing irrigation management
    and automation irrigation trigger, were evaluated. The farmer''s existing irrigation
    management included 1 h of irrigation per day in June and twice in 1 h of irrigation
    per day in July and August. The automation irrigation trigger method was based
    on the soil moisture sensor data and used Equation (1). Four replications with
    randomized plot designs were utilized for the comparison. The team has collected
    the number of marketable tomatoes and their weights to compare the effectiveness
    of the treatments. Eight plants per replication were considered. Statistic software
    R v4.3.1 was utilized for running a one-way ANOVA. figure 5 Figure 5. Automation
    irrigation demonstration in Hart, MI, USA. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Soil moisture
    sensor calibration The calibration of the SoilWatch 10 soil moisture sensor was
    conducted for sand and loamy sand. Soil temperature during this laboratory experiment
    was kept constant at 22 ± 1°C. The soil moisture sensors were powered at 3.3 V,
    and analog raw counts were used for the calibration. Figure 6 shows the comparison
    of measured VWC and raw count. Based on the curve fitting, Equation (5) was developed.
    The calibration of SoilWatch 10 was based on a wide range of VWC from 0.04 to
    0.4 cm3/cm3. The calibration of the sensor provided confidence in using it for
    field demonstration. VWC  = 2 E - 13 ( R C ) 3 - 4 E - 9 ( R C ) 2 + 4 E - 5 (
    R C ) - 0 . 0677     ( 5 ) where VWC is the volumetric water content (cm3/cm3)
    and RC is the analog raw counts that outputs from the sensor. figure 6 Figure
    6. The calibration curve for SoilWatch 10. 3.2 The performance evaluation of the
    soil moisture sensor The performance of the soil moisture sensor in the sand and
    loamy sand was evaluated. Figures 7, 8 show the comparison of sensors with measured
    VWC using a gravimetric method for sand and loamy sand, respectively. Table 2
    shows the result of the statistical analysis. The MBE values for the soil moisture
    sensor showed that this sensor overestimated VWC by an average of 0.01 cm3/cm3
    in the sand and underestimated it by an average of 0.02 cm3/cm3 in the loamy sand.
    The performance of the soil moisture sensor for sand and loamy sand satisfied
    both MBE and RMSE criteria. The MBE values of the calibrated SoilWatch 10 were
    similar to Campbell Scientific''s CS 616 TDR sensors. The MBE of CS 616 for sand
    and loamy sand were 0.01 and 0.03 cm3/cm3, respectively (Dong et al., 2020). The
    calibrated SoilWatch 10 provided reliable performance in measuring moisture content
    in sand and loamy sand. This confirmed the satisfaction of the calibration process.

    for sand. figure 8 Figure 8. A comparison of the SoilWatch 10 with the soil sampling
    method for loamy sand. table 2 Table 2. A statistical analysis to compare measured
    values to sensor values. 3.3 Demonstration in an irrigated corn field Figure 9
    shows the collected soil moisture sensor data, precipitation, and irrigation.
    Appropriate irrigation should maintain the soil moisture level in the root zone
    at an optimal level and ensure the water does not flow below the root zone to
    save freshwater and energy, reducing nutrient leaching and maximizing return on
    investment. The corn roots in this demonstration field grew up to 90 cm; thus,
    the goal of irrigation management was to moisten only the top 90 cm of soil. During
    the growing season, five events affected increasing soil moisture levels at a
    depth of 90 cm, which means that the water has reached and passed through the
    90 cm depth. In events #1, #3, and #5, soil moisture at a depth of 90 cm increased
    due to continuous and heavy rainfalls. In events #2 and #3, the soil moisture
    level at 90 cm depth was increased due to the combination of rainfall and irrigation.
    The corn farmer in Michigan typically applied irrigation each time between 2.50–3.20
    cm. When heavy rainfall is forecasted, the farmer could reduce the irrigation
    application volume to capture the rainfall within the root zone and minimize the
    potential leaching of water and nutrients below the root zone. In addition, the
    installation of the SoilWatch 10 soil moisture sensors within the root zone and
    right below the root zone helps to evaluate whether the farmer is applying irrigation
    adequately or excessively. These sensor data are helpful in making better-informed
    decisions on when and how much to irrigate. figure 9 Figure 9. The volumetric
    water content at 15, 45, and 90 cm soil depths at an irrigated corn demonstration
    field. 3.4 Demonstration in an irrigated blueberry field In the irrigated blueberry
    field, soil moisture sensors were installed at 15, 30, 45, and 60 cm depths. The
    flow rate of the drip emitter was 41 cm/h and was applied for 60 min during each
    application. During this monitoring period, there were no rainfalls. Figure 10
    shows the soil moisture changes from the farmer''s irrigation management practice.
    Proper irrigation for blueberries on this farm should ensure that water does not
    flow below the root zone, which is the top 45 cm of soil depth. Figure 10 indicates
    that the farmer''s existing irrigation management practice provided an adequate
    amount of water to the blueberry root system. However, the overirrigation events
    were observed because of the spike in the soil moisture sensor at both 45 and
    60 cm depths. Thus, it was recommended to reduce the irrigation time from 60 min
    to 40 min. The farmer tested his part of the field to demonstrate the reduced
    and recommended irrigation management practice. Figure 11 shows the soil moisture
    monitoring at the reduced and recommended irrigation plots. The reduced irrigation
    increased the soil moisture levels of the depth up to 30 cm, which is the effective
    water uptake root zone for blueberries grown in sandy soil. Thus, the reduced
    and recommended amount was adequate; however, when the blueberry was at the significant
    growth stage (at first blue fruit) and higher ET, more frequent (three times a
    day) irrigation was suggested, if needed. The soil type in this blueberry field
    is loamy sand. A smaller amount and more frequent application might be needed
    for the fields that have sandy soil. For finer texture soils, irrigating once
    a day with large volume application might be adequate as they have a large water
    holding capacity. figure 10 Figure 10. Soil moisture monitoring at the existing
    blueberry farmer''s irrigation practice at the blue fruit stage. figure 11 Figure
    11. Soil moisture monitoring of adjusted irrigation practice at the blue fruit
    stage. The total yield/plant and 50-berry weights were collected from this demonstration
    field for both the farmer''s existing irrigation method and the reduced/recommended
    irrigation management. The yield per plant for the farmer''s irrigation method
    and the recommended irrigation management were 552 and 722 g, respectively. There
    were statistical differences between the treatments (p = 0.025). 50-berry weights
    for the farmer''s irrigation method and the recommended irrigation management
    were 87.7 and 93.7 g, respectively. There were statistical differences between
    the treatments (p = 0.013). A potential cause of higher yield in the recommended
    irrigation management could be due to proper irrigation application that reduced
    nutrient leaching below the root zone in the sandy soil. An IoT-based irrigation
    management can help save water while maintaining the same blueberry quality and
    yields as the farmer''s typical irrigation management. 3.5 Irrigation automation
    in a tomato field Figure 12 shows the number of tomatoes that are marketable and
    their total weight from each treatment. The figure shows that there were no statistical
    differences among the treatments in the numbers of marketable tomatoes from the
    2022 growing season (p = 0.382) and their weights (p = 0.756). Thus, the production
    and quality of tomatoes were similar from all treatments, but the amount of applied
    irrigation was different. The sensor-based irrigation strategy applied a 30% lower
    amount than the farmer''s irrigation scheduling method, which indicates that the
    farmer could improve their irrigation water use efficiency using the sensor technology.
    An IoT-based automation irrigation management using a soil moisture sensor''s
    recommendation can help to save water by 30% while maintaining the same marketable
    yields and quality of tomatoes as the farmer''s typical irrigation management.
    In addition to conserving water, saving energy by pumping less water reduces farm
    energy costs. Moreover, low energy usage contributes to reducing greenhouse gas
    emissions from agriculture. The primary benefit of an automatic irrigation system
    is that it can save farmers'' time and labor costs in operating the irrigation
    system. figure 12 Figure 12. The total number of marketable tomatoes (A) and the
    total weight of marketable tomatoes from each replication (B). T1 is the farmer''s
    typical irrigation management. T2 is an IoT soil moisture sensor-based irrigation
    recommendation. 4 Conclusion Based on the field demonstration, the IoT-based sensor
    technology has proven to improve irrigation water use efficiency by evaluating
    the farmer''s existing irrigation practices and providing recommendations if needed.
    Providing real-time in-field soil moisture sensor data is helpful in making day-to-day
    irrigation management decisions, especially under unpredictable precipitation
    patterns. Minimizing overirrigation can reduce the risk of nutrients leaching
    below the root zone, ultimately protecting groundwater quality. In future studies,
    more on-farm demonstrations are needed to increase technology adoption. In addition,
    a continuation of extension outreach activities to promote making irrigation management
    decisions based on scientific data is needed. Besides irrigation management, this
    IoT sensor technology can be utilized to help other management practices such
    as nutrient, pesticide, insecticide, frost protection, and plant health monitoring
    (heat and water stress). Therefore, continued efforts to explore the application
    of IoT-based sensor technology in agriculture to combat the effect of climate
    change are needed. LOCOMOS utilizes cellular networks to communicate; however,
    cellular reception may be poor in some rural areas. Other communication network
    systems, such as radio, NB-IoT, and Sigfox, should be explored to overcome the
    signal issues. Moreover, the effectiveness of IoT-based technology should also
    be evaluated in other crop types. The usability of the LOCOMOS technology, including
    the installation technique, software interface, data accessibility, and alert
    systems, needs to be improved to make the technology easy to adopt for farmers.
    Additionally, other potential applications of the LOCOMOS platform, such as wind
    speed for spray drift reduction, soil moisture sensors for irrigation management,
    leaf surface temperature measurement for plant heat stress, and carbon dioxide
    measurement for greenhouse gas emission, should be considered in the future. Concerns
    about agricultural water use have been and will continue to grow due to the effect
    of climate change on agriculture. Because water is a limited resource, technologies
    that improve irrigation water use efficiency will play a significant role in increasing
    agricultural water sustainability. Data availability statement The datasets presented

    Figures Versions Notes Abstract This review underscores the escalating global
    research trend in this field since 2000. The primary scientific disciplines contributing
    to extensive research on smart water meters are engineering, computer science,
    and energy. In terms of countries, the analysis reveals that the United States,
    India, and China exhibit the highest scientific production. Concerning affiliations,
    prominent contributors include Griffith University, Politecnico di Milano, and
    the Università degli Studi di Salerno. Regarding worldwide research trends, an
    examination of distinct clusters defined by their principal keywords was conducted.
    The following clusters were identified in order of significance based on the number
    of publications: Urban Water Meters, IoT Connection, Communication and Security,
    Grid Management, Water Networks, Hot Water, Groundwater Monitoring, and Smart
    Irrigation. Of particular note is the growing use of machine learning applications,
    especially in the management of distribution networks. This trend opens up a promising
    avenue for addressing complex problems in real time. Keywords: smart metering;
    urban infrastructure; water conservation; energy management; data analytics; sustainable
    resource management 1. Introduction Concerns about water supply and quality have
    been a constant focus in human development. Currently, especially in developed
    countries, there is a significant emphasis on the sanitary and overall quality
    aspects of water. Various regulations establish the criteria to be followed in
    water supply [1]. The consumption of water on our planet has tripled in the 20th
    century, attributed to factors such as continuous population growth, water poverty,
    poor management, and outdated or inadequate facilities, contributing to a global
    water crisis. Consequently, water resources are becoming increasingly expensive
    and scarce, fueling a strong interest in their effective control and efficient
    use. Across various sectors, from industry to agriculture, extensive efforts are
    being made to monitor water distribution networks [2]. To address this significant
    challenge, distribution networks need to become more efficient by reducing losses,
    and consumers must also play a role in decreasing their water consumption. In
    the energy sector, studies and actions have already been undertaken to enhance
    the functioning of related facilities [3]. The substantial user base leads to
    a continuously rising water consumption, necessitating precise control mechanisms,
    despite the high costs associated with installing multiple monitoring instruments
    and their corresponding actuators [4]. Measurement devices often malfunction,
    leading to interventions based on lower-quality data. While studies on urban water
    consumption in broad areas have been conducted [5], research on specific buildings
    is scarce. For individual buildings, the LEED certification (Leadership in Energy
    and Environmental Design) is frequently employed, sought after by many businesses
    in their business plans [6]. Consumption signatures are used to identify the individual
    consumption of each device [7], enabling the identification of more complex consumption
    patterns. Such algorithms have successfully been applied in public buildings for
    energy use rationalization [8]. The role of the Internet of Things (IoT) in water
    supply chain management is crucial for understanding the future trajectory at
    the intersection of computer science and resource management [9]. Actuators play
    a vital role in enabling the automation of various smart city services [10]. The
    primary goal of this study is to scrutinize the entire body of scientific literature
    pertaining to smart water meters on a global scale, emphasizing the significance
    of understanding research trends in this domain. 2. Materials and Methods This
    bibliometric study utilized Scopus databases as the primary source for data retrieval.
    Despite Scopus containing historical content dating back to 1788, the search was
    restricted to the period between 2000 and 2022. The research methodology encompasses
    a comprehensive approach involving data collection, preprocessing, and multifaceted
    analysis to unveil and comprehend scientific communities and their collaborative
    patterns, see Figure 1. Figure 1. Methodology. In the initial phase, scholarly
    publications and their associated metadata were retrieved from the globally recognized
    Scopus database. The Scopus API was leveraged to conduct a targeted search focused
    on documents related to smart water meters, aligning with established research
    methodologies [11]. The search query employed was as follows: TITLE-ABS-KEY (smart*
    AND (water* OR flow*) AND meter*). All documents were downloaded from Scopus leading
    to the annotated search. Crafted to cover a broad spectrum of literature, the
    query specifically addressed terms related to “smart water meter” or “smart flow
    meter” and their practical applications across various communities. However, the
    methodology introduced in this study effectively manages this potential issue,
    thanks to the resulting network graph’s structure and which can be visualized
    with the Gephi (open-source tool). After acquiring the raw dataset, a preprocessing
    phase ensued, employing Microsoft Excel and OpenRefine for basic data organization
    and cleansing. This ensured that the dataset was primed for advanced analysis.
    For the core analysis, the open-source tool Gephi was employed, capitalizing on
    its robust capabilities in statistical analysis and data visualization. The data
    underwent refinement to eliminate documents lacking meaningful connections within
    the main body of scientific literature. This curation process allowed this research
    to focus specifically on the most pertinent documents and their relationships.
    For the primary screening, the open-source tool Gephi was employed, taking advantage
    of its robust statistical analysis and data visualization capabilities. The dataset
    was subjected to a filtering process to eliminate documents that did not establish
    any connection with the rest of the documents. This filtering allowed us to focus
    the cluster analysis on the most relevant documents and their associations. For
    this purpose, we employed a community detection algorithm based on modularity
    in large networks, as detailed in [12]. Specifically, Gephi’s algorithm used Louvain’s
    method, a widely accepted approach for community detection. Louvain’s method is
    optimized for large networks, with the goal of identifying modular structures
    by maximizing a modularity score within the range of −0.5 to 1. This score evaluates
    the density of edges within clusters compared to those between clusters. The Louvain
    method was chosen because of its computational efficiency and its ability to delineate
    clear structures in intricate datasets. Although alternative algorithms such as
    Girvan–Newman, Infomap, and Label Propagation were considered, they proved less
    suitable due to their computational intensity, limited relevance to citation networks,
    or production of less cohesive structures, respectively. For the sorting by year,
    by subject category, and by country, these data are obtained directly from the
    Scopus search in the results analysis section of the website itself. It is possible
    to export them in CSV format. Later, year and subject category data were imported
    and represented using Excel. Country data have been mapped with QGIS software
    3.28. A comprehensive bibliometric analysis will be undertaken to delve into the
    evolution of publications over the years. This includes a meticulous examination
    of the countries and affiliations that make the most substantial contributions
    to this scientific field. Additionally, this study will focus on dissecting the
    key words employed in the articles, aiming to discern the scientific communities
    within which these works can be categorized. The overarching aim is to provide
    a comprehensive and insightful overview of the landscape of smart water meter

    is a gradual increase in the number of publications, with a significant spike
    in 2010, where the count jumps to 85. This suggests a growing interest in and
    focus on the subject during that period. The most substantial growth occurs in
    the subsequent years, particularly from 2011 to 2019, with a remarkable surge
    in publications. The year 2019 stands out with 281 articles, reflecting a substantial

    research, highlighting the interdisciplinary nature of the field and the varied
    priorities within the academic community. Cluster 1, identified as Urban Water
    Meters, stands out as the most significant in terms of size. Table 4 outlines
    the frequency (N) of occurrences of primary keywords associated with this cluster.
    It is noteworthy that this cluster leads in 18 out of the 20 main keywords, indicating
    a higher concentration of these terms within this community compared to others.
    In fact, eight of the 20 main keywords, such as Residential Water and Water Efficiency,
    are exclusive to this cluster. Over the past two decades, more or less detailed
    measurement programs, referred to as smart measures, have been developed [13].
    This progress has led to nearly continuous monitoring of water consumption. The
    abundance of available data has prompted the exploration of strategies for modeling
    and managing water in residential areas [14]. Periodic resource scarcity drives
    interest in limiting and controlling losses; leading studies toward water, notably
    by Rahim et al. [15], demand planning, socio-economic analysis, behavioral analysis,
    classification of water-related events, and user feedback. The cluster’s connection
    with information technology is evident, sharing techniques with other supply systems
    such as electricity or gas [16]. These meters enable the identification of the
    final use of water, a crucial aspect for making utility predictions [17]. The
    technology has matured sufficiently to transition from pilot trials to real-world
    implementation in large supply networks [18] and urban supply planning, closely
    intertwined with city planning itself [19]. Additionally, the current analyses
    aim to disaggregate data to reach individual events [20]. Reengineering of existing
    systems can be undertaken in light of the results already achieved [21]. Cluster
    2, denoted as IOT Connection, forms a community centered on Internet of Things
    (IoT) connection algorithms and network implementation. Ranking as the second-largest
    community, Table 4 details the frequency (N) of primary keywords associated with
    this cluster, establishing connections with the Urban Water metering and Communication
    and Security communities, while maintaining ties with the Energy consumption cluster.
    Among its 20 main keywords, 12 are intrinsic to this cluster, and it holds significance
    as the leading community in 8 of them. Its primary associations lie with Clusters
    1, 3, and 4, positioning it as a substantial and interconnected family with promising
    prospects for future development. Current meters are acknowledged for their sluggishness
    and time-intensive nature, promoting water wastage, thus advocating for the adoption
    of smart meters to enhance resource conservation and early fault detection [22,23].
    Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) architectures are anticipated to facilitate
    the integration of multiple networks simultaneously [24], aiming for user interaction
    [25]. The configuration of networks through smart water meters (SWM) and the advantageous
    use of IoT are highlighted in literature [26]. Case studies explore innovative
    applications, such as using pumps as generators or direct interaction with users
    [27], aligning with user interest in these devices [28]. Efficient data transmission
    mechanisms within the network involve relaying data from each node to the nearest
    node [29]. Two critical aspects, namely sensor network energy consumption and
    security issues, are underscored in the literature [30], emphasizing the multifaceted
    nature of research within the IOT Connection cluster. Cluster 3 was identified
    as Communication and Security and stands as the third-largest community. Table
    4 delineates the frequency (N) of principal keywords associated with this cluster,
    which revolves around communication and security aspects in network meters, particularly
    emphasizing energy meters. Remarkably, it encapsulates the top 10 keywords among
    the first 20 across all clusters, asserting its significance in this domain. In
    half of these 20 keywords, this community holds the utmost importance, while in
    the remaining 10, it shares keywords with other communities, primarily with Clusters
    1 and 3. This community is predominantly concerned with communication protocols
    and applications of automatic meters, with a focus on reducing peak consumption,
    a growingly attractive topic [31]. Traditional systems, effective thus far in
    electricity and water distribution, are deemed insecure and lacking user feedback
    capabilities [32]. Smart energy meters can be leveraged to monitor other types
    of meters, integrated into networks [33,34]. The computerized control of these
    networks [35] presents a challenge in terms of vulnerability to intrusions [36],
    necessitating resolution in future developments [37]. Data aggregation allows
    for processing while maintaining user privacy [38]. The Communication and Security
    cluster, thus, contributes significantly to the exploration of secure and effective
    communication protocols in smart metering systems. Cluster 4 was identified as
    Grid Management. Table 5 provides an overview of the primary keywords associated
    with this cluster. Positioned as a peripheral cluster, it primarily addresses
    the challenges in managing vast amounts of grid data. Although it shares keywords
    with other communities, it assumes a leading role in what is termed Big Data,
    highlighting its auxiliary nature in supporting other fields. This specialized
    community focuses on the implementation of intelligent algorithms for information
    acquisition, data processing, and swift action in extensive supply networks, predominantly
    in energy but extending to other domains such as water or gas [39,40,41]. The
    characterization of overall consumption holds a prominent place in this cluster,
    particularly in the context of water, leveraging time series [42] or neural networks
    [43]. Grid Management emerges as a crucial contributor to the application of intelligent
    algorithms for efficient data management and consumption characterization in large-scale
    supply networks. Cluster 5, labelled as Water Network Partitioning, is outlined
    in Table 5, featuring the primary keywords associated with this cluster. Characterized
    as an isolated cluster, it addresses the challenges of metering an extensive network
    through the analysis of smaller network components. Despite being a smaller cluster,
    it holds significance, representing 1.97% of the keywords. Within this group,
    all authors are closely interconnected, collaborating on a specific strategy for
    distribution network analysis. This strategy involves studying reduced sectors
    of the network to simplify the analysis [44,45,46]. The methodology employed includes
    the installation of valves and smart meters on main lines, accompanied by the
    development of specialized software for these meters, referred to as SWAM [47,48].
    This technique has been applied in fault detection and pollution control [49]
    through recursive sectorization [50]. The Water Network Partitioning cluster,
    although smaller in size, plays a vital role in the exploration of innovative
    strategies for network analysis, particularly in the context of simplifying analysis
    through the study of smaller network components. Cluster 6 focuses on Water Heating
    and the associated metering of this valuable resource, as detailed in Table 5
    with the primary keywords for this cluster. Comprising 1.13% of the keywords,
    this well-defined community primarily interacts with Cluster 1. The majority of
    the keywords within this family are unique to it, although none stands out as
    particularly abundant. The substantial cost of this resource amplifies the significance
    of this family, as highlighted by Bacher et al. [51]. The research within this
    cluster involves the development of prediction models for resource needs, particularly
    emphasizing scenarios in cold climates [52]. Detection of leaks is of particular
    importance due to the high energy costs [53]. This family extends its exploration
    to related networks such as domestic heat and gas, demonstrating a comprehensive
    approach to resource management [54,55]. The Water Heating and metering cluster,
    while relatively small, delves into crucial aspects of resource prediction, environmental
    considerations, and the efficient management of expensive resources. The remaining
    clusters are of limited size but represent emerging sectors with promising prospects
    for future studies. Cluster 7 is a small cluster centered on Groundwater Monitoring,
    utilizing various approaches. It occupies a peripheral position in the diagram
    and is related to Cluster 1, accounting for 0.99% of the keywords. Similar to
    Cluster 8, the majority of the keywords within this group are specific to it,
    sharing few words with other clusters. Table 6 lists the most representative keywords
    for this cluster. Water crisis and the threat of resource shortage are identified
    as direct consequences of factors such as limited precipitation, traditional irrigation
    methods, and inefficient monitoring and control systems in agriculture [56]. This
    cluster serves as a unique case within monitoring, often supported by simulation
    models [57,58,59]. It places special emphasis on control elements and leverages
    other components, such as energy meters, to enhance information completeness [60].
    Additionally, Cluster 7 connects with the use of unconventional water sources,
    such as desalinated water for urban use and reclaimed water for agricultural purposes
    [61]. Cluster 8, also a small cluster, is dedicated to Smart Irrigation control,
    representing 0.85% of the keywords. This group features highly specific keywords,
    occasionally shared with Cluster 1 and Cluster 3. Table 6 displays the most representative
    keywords for this cluster. Focused on intelligent control of irrigation systems
    to promote water savings and efficiency [62], this cluster emphasizes user satisfaction
    as a crucial parameter [63]. Initially applied in residential landscaping [62,63],
    smart irrigation is currently being implemented in agricultural areas [64,65,66].
    This family exhibits significant development potential, with numerous sensors
    of this type being deployed in agricultural areas [67]. In the analysis, two clusters
    with minimal representation emerge—one focused on data acquisition, sensors, and
    pattern recognition of consumption. For instance, Grigoras et al. [68] present
    an innovative solution in the form of a software platform for sustainable water
    supply system management. This platform incorporates advanced ICT solutions, including
    Blockchain and Artificial Intelligence, along with smart concepts such as smart
    metering and demand response, offering benefits to both the energy and water sectors.
    Additionally, there is another cluster specialized in automated decision making,
    utilizing learning programs, decision support programs, etc. [69,70]. 5. Discussion
    The analysis of the clusters reveals several challenges and prospects in smart
    water meter research. One key challenge lies in the need for more extensive exploration
    and development of clusters related to emerging sectors, such as Groundwater Monitoring
    and Smart Irrigation Control. These clusters, though relatively small, represent
    critical areas of study with promising potential for future research. The challenge
    is to further investigate and expand these clusters to gain a comprehensive understanding
    of their applications and implications for water resource management. Another
    challenge is the integration of various clusters, particularly those related to
    Communication and Security (Cluster 3) and Grid Management (Cluster 4). As smart
    water metering systems become more sophisticated, addressing the communication
    protocols, security vulnerabilities, and efficient management of vast amounts
    of data in the grid becomes crucial. Integrating findings from these clusters
    can contribute to the development of comprehensive and secure smart water networks.
    On the positive side, the clusters also offer promising prospects. For instance,
    the increasing focus on Smart Irrigation Control (Cluster 8) indicates a growing
    interest in water conservation and efficient agricultural practices, as recent
    studies indicate [71]. This cluster’s emphasis on user satisfaction and its potential
    application in agricultural areas signal a positive trend toward sustainable water
    use in farming. Additionally, the intersection of Water Network Partitioning (Cluster
    5) with unconventional water sources like desalinated water and reclaimed water
    opens up opportunities for diversifying water supply strategies. Exploring innovative
    approaches to network analysis and water source utilization can contribute to
    more resilient and sustainable water supply systems. It is worth noting the increasing
    use of machine learning applications, especially in the management of distribution
    networks. This trend opens up a promising avenue for addressing complex problems
    in real time [72]. So, the challenges lie in further exploring and integrating
    emerging clusters, while the prospects include advancements in smart irrigation,
    secure communication protocols, and diversified water supply strategies, ultimately
    contributing to the development of more efficient and sustainable smart water
    metering systems. 6. Conclusions In conclusion, the analysis of smart water metering

    PDF 1 Introduction Agriculture is vital in ensuring food security and sustainable
    development, nourishing a growing global population. However, traditional agricultural
    practices face numerous challenges, including diminishing arable land, environmental
    degradation, and increasing demands for food production [1]. Innovative approaches
    incorporating advanced materials have emerged to address these challenges and
    enhance the efficiency of agricultural systems. Among these materials, two-dimensional
    (2D) based hybrid materials have shown great promise in revolutionizing the agriculture
    industry. Two-dimensional materials refer to thin sheets of materials with only
    one or a few atoms in thickness [2]. These materials possess unique properties
    due to their ultra-thin nature, high surface-to-volume ratio, and exceptional
    mechanical, electrical, and chemical properties [3, 4]. They have garnered significant
    attention in various scientific disciplines, including materials science, electronics,
    energy storage, and agriculture [2]. The utilization of 2D-based hybrid materials
    in agriculture offers several advantages over conventional practices [5]. Firstly,
    their large surface area allows for increased absorption and retention of nutrients
    and water, leading to improved plant growth and development. Secondly, their unique
    electrical and optical properties enable the development of sensors and actuators
    that can monitor and regulate various environmental factors, optimizing crop growth
    conditions [6]. Additionally, the incorporation of 2D materials into hybrid structures
    can enhance mechanical strength, stability, and durability, ensuring long-term
    performance in agricultural applications. Graphene, a single layer of carbon atoms
    arranged in a honeycomb lattice, is one of the most extensively studied 2D materials
    [7, 8]. Its exceptional electrical conductivity, thermal stability, and mechanical
    strength make it an ideal candidate for various agricultural applications [9,
    10]. For instance, graphene-based sensors can detect soil moisture, temperature,
    and nutrient levels in real-time, providing precise data for efficient irrigation
    and fertilization. Graphene-based nanocomposites have also demonstrated the ability
    to improve soil water-holding capacity and nutrient retention, reducing water
    and fertilizer consumption while enhancing crop yields [11, 12]. Transition metal
    dichalcogenides (TMDs) are another class of 2D materials that hold tremendous
    potential in agriculture. These materials exhibit unique optical and electronic
    properties, making them suitable for applications such as photocatalysis and plant
    disease detection. TMD-based hybrid materials have shown promise in the removal
    of pollutants from soil and water, contributing to soil remediation and environmental
    sustainability [13, 14]. Moreover, the integration of TMDs with conventional materials
    can enhance the efficiency of pesticide delivery systems, reducing chemical usage
    and minimizing environmental risks [15]. The synthesis and fabrication of 2D-based
    hybrid materials for agriculture require precise control and manipulation of the
    material''s structure and properties. Various techniques such as chemical vapor
    deposition (CVD) [16, 17], physical vapor deposition (PVD) [18], and electrochemical
    deposition have been employed to synthesize 2D materials with desired properties.
    The combination of these techniques with conventional fabrication methods allows
    for the development of hybrid materials with tailored characteristics suitable
    for specific agricultural applications. The potential applications of 2D-based
    hybrid materials in agriculture are vast and diverse. Improved nutrient delivery
    systems can be achieved through the incorporation of 2D materials in fertilizers,
    enabling controlled release and efficient utilization of nutrients by plants.
    Enhanced crop growth and productivity can be realized by optimizing environmental
    conditions using 2D-based sensors and actuators. Additionally, the remediation
    of contaminated soils and water bodies can be facilitated by the use of 2D-based
    adsorbents and catalysts [14]. Despite the significant potential of 2D-based hybrid
    materials, several challenges need to be addressed for their widespread implementation
    in agricultural systems. Environmental and health concerns associated with the
    use of these advanced materials require thorough investigation to ensure their
    safe and sustainable use [19]. Furthermore, economic feasibility and scalability
    need to be considered to ensure the practicality of these materials for small-scale
    and large-scale farming operations. Continued research and development efforts
    are required to overcome these challenges and further unlock the full potential
    of 2D-based hybrid materials in agriculture. The future perspectives of 2D-based
    hybrid materials in agriculture are highly promising. Ongoing research aims to
    explore new combinations of 2D materials with other components to enhance their
    functionality and performance. For instance, the integration of these materials
    with biodegradable polymers can lead to the development of environmentally friendly
    and sustainable agricultural products [20]. Additionally, nanotechnology and material
    engineering advancements will enable the production of 2D-based hybrid materials
    with tailored properties for specific agricultural needs. One area of future exploration
    is the development of smart nanomaterials that can respond to environmental stimuli
    and regulate plant growth processes [21]. These materials can potentially release
    growth-promoting substances, such as hormones or signaling molecules, in response
    to specific conditions, optimizing plant development and increasing crop yields.
    Furthermore, the integration of nano sensors into 2D-based hybrid materials can
    facilitate real-time monitoring of crop health, pest infestation, and disease
    outbreaks, enabling early detection and targeted intervention [22]. The utilization
    of 2D-based hybrid materials in precision agriculture is another area of great
    interest. Precision agriculture aims to optimize farming practices by using technology
    and data-driven decision-making. By incorporating 2D materials into precision
    farming systems, farmers can gather accurate and timely information about soil
    conditions, nutrient levels, and plant health, leading to efficient resource management
    and reduced environmental impact. Collaboration between scientists, engineers,
    agronomists, and farmers is crucial for the successful implementation of 2D-based
    hybrid materials in agriculture. The interdisciplinary nature of this field requires
    a holistic approach, considering not only the technical aspects but also the social,
    economic, and environmental implications [23]. Regulatory frameworks and policies
    need to be developed to ensure these materials’ safe and responsible use, addressing
    concerns related to human health, ecosystem impact, and ethical considerations.
    Therefore, two-dimensional-based hybrid materials hold tremendous potential to
    revolutionize the agriculture system. Their unique properties and functionalities
    offer new opportunities to address the challenges faced by traditional farming
    practices. 2 Overview of Various Two-Dimensional Materials in Agriculture Two-dimensional

    of only a few atomic layers or a single layer. These materials are composed of
    atoms or molecules arranged in a two-dimensional plane, unveiling unique properties
    due to their ultrathin nature [4]. The confinement of electrons in the plane leads
    to significant changes in their electronic, optical, thermal, and mechanical properties
    compared to their bulk counterparts. There are numerous 2D materials available
    with befitting features for agriculture systems (Table 1). Some of them are given
    as follows: Table 1 Varied types of two-dimensional (2-D) materials in agriculture

    has potential applications in agriculture, such as in the development of high-performance
    sensors for monitoring soil conditions, optimizing irrigation, and detecting nutrient
    deficiencies in plants [27]. 2.5 Metal Oxides Metal oxides, such as titanium dioxide
    (TiO2) and zinc oxide (ZnO), can be fabricated into 2D forms [28]. These materials
    have photocatalytic properties and can be used for water purification, eliminating
    organic pollutants and harmful microorganisms from agricultural water sources.
    2.6 MXenes These are a family of 2D materials formed by selectively etching layers
    from layered transition metal carbides, nitrides, or carbonitrides known as MAX
    phases [29]. MXenes exhibit high electrical conductivity and excellent mechanical
    properties. They have potential applications in agricultural sensors, energy storage
    devices, and water treatment systems [30]. 2.7 Silicene It is a 2D material composed
    of a single layer of silicon atoms arranged in a honeycomb lattice structure,
    similar to graphene. It shows unique electronic properties and has potential applications
    in electronics, optoelectronics, and energy storage devices. Silicene has garnered
    noteworthy attention due to its compatibility with existing silicon-based technology
    [31]. 2.8 Black Phosphorus Black phosphorus, also known as phosphorene, is a 2D
    material composed of phosphorus atoms arranged in a layered structure. It exhibits
    a high carrier mobility, making it suitable for electronics and photonics applications.
    Black phosphorus has shown promise in areas such as transistors, photodetectors,
    and energy storage devices [32, 33]. 2.9 Hexagonal Boron Nitride (h-BN) Hexagonal
    boron nitride, often referred to as “white graphene”, is a 2D material composed
    of alternating boron and nitrogen atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice structure
    [36]. It is an insulator with excellent thermal and chemical stability. h-BN is
    commonly used as a dielectric material in electronics, as a lubricant due to its
    low friction properties, and as a protective coating for various applications.
    2.10 Metal Dichalcogenides (MoS2, WS2 etc.) These are a class of 2D materials
    composed of a transition metal atom (such as molybdenum or tungsten) bonded with
    chalcogen atoms (such as sulphur or selenium). They exhibit a layered structure
    with excellent semiconducting properties [37]. Metal dichalcogenides have gained
    attention for their potential applications in electronics, optoelectronics, catalysis,
    and energy storage [34]. 2.11 Metal–Organic Frameworks (MOFs) Metal–organic frameworks
    are a class of 2D materials consisting of metal ions or clusters coordinated with
    organic ligands. They possess high porosity and large surface areas, making them
    suitable for applications such as gas storage and separation, drug delivery, and
    catalysis [38]. MOFs have the potential to improve soil fertility and nutrient
    management in agriculture. 2.12 Phosphorene Oxide Phosphorene oxide is a 2D material
    derived from black phosphorus by introducing oxygen functionalities. It exhibits
    unique properties and can be used for applications such as energy storage, sensing,
    and catalysis [39]. Phosphorene oxide has shown potential for use in agriculture,
    particularly in the development of efficient electrochemical sensors [35] for
    soil analysis and plant health monitoring. 2.13 Carbon Nitride Carbon nitride
    is a 2D material composed of carbon and nitrogen atoms. It exhibits a range of
    electronic and optical properties, depending on the composition and structure.
    Carbon nitride materials have potential applications in photocatalysis, water
    splitting, and energy conversion devices [40, 41]. They can contribute to sustainable
    agriculture by harnessing solar energy for various processes, such as water purification
    and crop growth enhancement. It is important to note that the field of 2D materials
    is continuously expanding, and new materials with unique properties are being
    discovered and synthesized. Each material enjoys unique properties that can be
    tailored for specific applications in agriculture, electronics, energy, and other
    fields. The versatility and tunability of 2D materials make them promising candidates
    for addressing the challenges and advancing innovation in innumerable industries.
    Therefore, 2D materials hold great promise for transforming agricultural systems
    with their unique properties, such as large surface area, high conductivity, and
    adsorption capabilities, enabling enhanced nutrient delivery, water management,
    soil remediation, disease and pest management, and upgraded crop growth and quality.
    Graphene, TMDs, BN, phosphorene, metal oxides, and MXenes are just a few specimens
    of the diverse range of 2D materials that can be utilized in agriculture. By harnessing
    the potential of these materials and fitting them into agricultural practices,
    we can pave the way for a more sustainable, efficient, and resilient agricultural
    industry [42]. Continued research and development efforts in this field are crucial
    to further explore the capabilities of 2D materials and realize their full potential
    in addressing the challenges of modern agriculture. 3 Synthesis and Fabrication
    Techniques of Hybrid Materials in Agriculture Hybrid materials, which combine
    two or more different materials with complementary properties, have gained significant
    attention in the field of agriculture. These materials offer unique functionalities
    and enhanced performance that can revolutionize agricultural practices and address
    various challenges. To harness the potential of hybrid materials, it is crucial
    to understand the synthesis and fabrication techniques involved in their production.
    Some of the techniques are explained as below (Fig. 1). Fig. 1 Different synthesis
    and fabrication techniques of 2D-hybrid materials Full size image 3.1 Solution-Based
    Methods Solution-based methods are extensively used for synthesizing hybrid materials
    in agriculture. One common technique is the sol–gel method, where precursor solutions
    are mixed and undergo hydrolysis and condensation reactions to form a gel-like
    structure followed by subsequent drying and heat treatment result in the formation
    of hybrid materials [43]. This procedure allows for the incorporation of different
    materials, such as 2D materials, polymers, nanoparticles, and organic compounds,
    into the final product. Solution-based methods offer versatility and control over
    the composition, morphology, and properties of these materials [44]. 3.2 Chemical
    Vapour Deposition (CVD) Chemical vapour deposition is a technique frequently employed
    for the synthesis of 2D materials and their integration into hybrid materials.
    In CVD, precursor gases are introduced into a reaction chamber, where they decompose
    and deposit on a substrate to form a thin film. By controlling the reaction parameters,
    such as temperature, pressure, and gas composition, hybrid materials can be fabricated
    with precise switch over the composition and morphology. CVD allows for the growth
    of large-area films and the integration of multiple materials, enabling the development
    of complex hybrid structures [16, 17]. 3.3 Electrospinning Electrospinning is
    a versatile technique used for fabricating hybrid materials in the form of nanofibers.
    In this course, a high voltage is applied to a polymer solution or melt, causing
    it to form a charged jet that is drawn towards a grounded collector [45]. By incorporating
    2D materials, nanoparticles, or other additives into the polymer solution, hybrid
    nanofibers with enhanced properties can be shaped. Electrospinning offers control
    over fibre diameter, porosity, and surface area, making it suitable for applications
    like controlled-release systems, filtration membranes, and tissue engineering
    scaffolds in agriculture. 3.4 Layer-By-Layer Assembly Layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly
    is a technique used for fabricating thin films with precise control over the layer
    thickness and composition. This method involves the sequential adsorption of oppositely
    charged materials onto a substrate [46]. By alternating between different materials,
    such as polymers, 2D materials, and nanoparticles, hybrid thin films can be constructed
    with tailored properties. LbL assembly allows for the incorporation of multiple
    components, enabling the design of functional coatings, sensors, and controlled-release
    systems for agricultural applications. 3.5 In Situ Growth and Modification In
    situ growth and modification techniques involve the synthesis or incorporation
    of materials directly within the agricultural system. For example, 2D materials
    can be grown on substrates or incorporated into hydrogels or porous structures
    through direct synthesis or modification techniques [47]. These in situ techniques
    enable the integration of hybrid materials into specific agricultural environments,
    such as soil amendments or plant growth substrates, facilitating their direct
    interaction with crops and enhancing their performance in agricultural systems.
    3.6 Self-Assembly Self-assembly is a technique where materials organize themselves
    into ordered structures through molecular interactions. By designing the molecular
    structure and properties of the components, self-assembly can be used to fabricate

    and efficient energy source for agricultural systems [94]. The integration of
    solar panels made from 2D materials, such as graphene, can capture solar energy
    and convert it into electricity to power various agricultural processes. This
    integration can reduce reliance on conventional energy sources and promote greener
    and more sustainable farming practices. 15.7 Multifunctional Materials Future
    breakthroughs in 2D-based hybrid materials will involve the development of multifunctional
    materials that can perform multiple tasks simultaneously. Researchers are exploring
    the incorporation of different functionalities into a single material, such as
    nutrient delivery, water retention, and pest control [95]. This integration can
    lead to the development of advanced materials that offer comprehensive solutions
    for multiple agricultural challenges. Multifunctional materials can streamline
    agricultural processes, reduce the need for multiple applications, and enhance
    overall efficiency [79]. 15.8 Integration of Internet of Things (IoT) The integration
    of 2D-based hybrid materials with the Internet of Things (IoT) technology presents
    a significant opportunity for the future of agriculture [78]. By connecting sensors,
    devices, and agricultural equipment through wireless networks, farmers can monitor
    and control various aspects of their operations remotely. This integration can
    facilitate real-time data collection, analysis, and decision-making, leading to
    optimized resource management, reduced waste, and improved productivity [79].
    The combination of 2D-based hybrid materials and IoT can enable precision agriculture
    on a large scale. 15.9 Collaboration and Interdisciplinary Research To unlock
    the full potential of 2D-based hybrid materials in agriculture, collaboration,
    and interdisciplinary research are essential. Collaboration between material scientists,
    agronomists, engineers, and farmers can facilitate knowledge exchange, innovation,
    and the practical implementation of these materials in agricultural systems [52].
    Interdisciplinary research efforts can address complex agricultural challenges
    from multiple perspectives, leading to holistic solutions that consider the social,
    economic, and environmental aspects of agriculture. 15.10 Policy and Regulatory

    on the development of supportive policies and regulatory frameworks. Governments
    and regulatory bodies need to keep pace with advancements in the field and establish
    guidelines for the safe and responsible use of these materials [52]. Supporting
    research funding, promoting technology transfer, and providing incentives for
    the adoption of 2D-based hybrid materials can accelerate their development and
    implementation in agriculture. The future of 2D-based hybrid materials in agriculture
    holds tremendous potential for transforming farming practices, enhancing resource
    efficiency, and promoting sustainability. With ongoing advancements, we can anticipate
    a future where agriculture is more sustainable, efficient, and resilient. 16 Conclusion
    The integration of two-dimensional (2D) materials in agriculture has the potential
    to revolutionize farming practices and pave the way for sustainable and efficient
    agricultural systems. The utilization of 2D-based hybrid materials in agriculture
    offers a wide range of potential benefits. These materials have shown promise
    in enhancing nutrient delivery systems, improving crop growth and productivity,
    remediating soils, increasing pesticide and fertilizer efficiency, managing water
    resources, and mitigating environmental pollution. By leveraging the unique properties
    of 2D materials and combining them with other materials, we can achieve enhanced
    functionality and performance, resulting in more sustainable and efficient agricultural
    practices. Continued research and development in the field of 2D-based hybrid
    materials in agriculture are crucial for unlocking their full potential. There
    is still much to discover and understand about these materials, including their
    synthesis and fabrication techniques, performance under different environmental
    conditions, long-term efficacy, and safety aspects. Furthermore, exploring novel
    2D materials, integrating them with emerging technologies such as nanotechnology
    and IoT, and investigating their interactions with plants, soil microorganisms,
    and ecosystems will further advance our knowledge and capabilities. Research and
    development efforts should focus on optimizing the properties and functionalities
    of 2D-based hybrid materials, improving their scalability, cost-effectiveness,
    and environmental compatibility, and addressing any potential risks or limitations
    associated with their use. Additionally, collaborative research endeavours that
    bring together scientists, engineers, agronomists, policymakers, and farmers will
    facilitate the exchange of knowledge, foster innovation, and promote the practical
    application of these materials in real-world agricultural settings. The implementation
    of 2D-based hybrid materials in agriculture aligns with the broader goals of sustainable
    development, including the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
    These materials have the potential to contribute to multiple SDGs, such as zero
    hunger, clean water and sanitation, sustainable cities and communities, responsible
    consumption and production, and climate action. Therefore, by addressing key agricultural
    challenges and promoting resource-efficient practices, 2D-based hybrid materials
    can play a vital role in achieving a more sustainable, resilient, and food-secure
    future. References Singh, P.K., Naresh, R.K., Bhatt, R., Tiwari, H., Rajput, A.,

  description: In the midst of rising global population and environmental challenges,
    smart agriculture emerges as a vital solution by integrating advanced technologies
    to optimize agricultural practices. Through data-driven insights and automation,
    it tackles the necessity for sustainable resource management, enhancing productivity
    and resilience in the face of complex food security and ecological concerns. The
    prospects of utilizing the Internet of Things (IoT) for smart agriculture are
    tremendous, where many IoT devices can be deployed for local environment monitoring,
    precision farming, autonomous irrigation, and, soil management. In some use cases
    like smart monitoring and agrochemical applications, UAV-enabled mobile-edge computing
    (MEC) is proposed as an enabler to provide IoT nodes with additional resources
    by hosting their computation functions. From the implementation perspective, to
    flexibly manage the computation functions in UAVs and/or MEC server, the emerging
    network function virtualization (NFV) can be utilized. However, efficient orchestration
    of the virtualized functions would be a challenge. In this paper, we consider
    a decentralized UAV-aided MEC system for smart agricultural applications in which
    the processing nodes benefit from the NFV technology. We aim to propose a method
    for efficiently orchestrating the NFVs while some important metrics are minimized,
    i.e., the age of information (AoI) and total network energy consumption. Especially,
    we consider the case in which the network state is not fully observable to the
    orchestrator or the observations are exposed to uncertainties. Consequently, the
    problem is formulated as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision
    process (DEC-POMDP). As the formulated problem is NP-complete, we exploit some
    structural features of the proposed scheme to introduce the concept of symmetry
    and simplify the problem. Then, a novel decentralized federated learning-based
    solution is proposed to solve the problem. Simulation results show the effectiveness
    of the proposed approach in minimizing the total network energy consumption and
    achieving AoI values less than 200:msec to support demanding real-time applications.

  explanation: Considering the section "subsection_title", the text states that "Packets
    belonging to different packets are segregated into clusters of the same service.
    The data is sent through the network via an Aerial Network of hovering UAVs toward
    the local server. A series of service functions are required to be run on the
    received data, in order. Each UAV is mapped to a specific IoT device, and the
    UAVs must determine how to handle the data accordingly.", corresponding to point
    1 in the "point_focus" section. The text provides an overview of the system model
    and problem formulation. The goal is to find the optimal placement and scheduling
    of the service functions to process the incoming data from IoT devices, while
    minimizing the overall energy consumption and the freshness of the information
    (age of information).
  extract_1: We consider a real-time IoT network for smart agriculture applications,
    where, the IoT network provides real-time monitoring and visibility to network
    operators by video/image streaming. For such circumstances, several use cases
    from remote monitoring to security can be considered. As it is depicted in Fig.
    1, a set N of N IoT devices collect real-time information from a smart farm and
    send the packets to a local server. A UAV-aided MEC architecture is considered,
    where packets are forwarded through an Aerial Network consisting of U hovering
    UAVs toward the local server. We consider applications in which some processing
    functions, from primary processes (e.g., compression) to advanced ones (e.g.,
    object recognition) must be sequentially performed on the raw packets.

    IEEE Funding Agency: SECTION I. Introduction Smart farming in the contemporary
    world has gained paramount importance while playing a pivotal role in revolutionizing
    agricultural practices [1]. Conversely, the increasing global population along
    with environmental challenges have made the adoption of smart farming techniques
    indispensable. By leveraging data-driven insights, automation, and precision agriculture,
    smart farming not only enhances productivity but also addresses the pressing need
    for sustainable resource management [2]. On the other hand, the Internet of Things
    (IoT) has been a promising technology to provide connection among a large volume
    of devices that are deployed to provide a specific service for smart agriculture.
    A wide range of different use cases such as smart greenhouse monitoring, pest
    control, and irrigation/soil management can be considered [1], [3]. These use
    cases are mostly computation intensive and delay-sensitive [1], [4], [5]. A large
    volume of connected devices implies a large volume of data that must be processed
    accurately in a timely manner [6]. Such data computation and analysis demands
    a significant amount of processing and storage resources which put a constraint
    on energy-limited IoT devices. Depending on the specific application, the aggregated
    data from monitoring sensors, and captured images/videos from installed cameras
    in the field need to be processed in real-time to turn raw data into usable information.
    Introducing IoT and its applications in modern agriculture provides this industry
    with suitable tools to support farmers for better productivity, quality, and profitability
    [1]. Therefore, the scope of IoT extends beyond just agricultural land, encompassing
    a broader spectrum that includes the supply chain as well [7], [8]. Battery-operated
    IoT devices lack the capability to perform energy-intensive computations independently.
    Additionally, they face challenges related to limited processing power and storage
    capacity [9]. Therefore, MEC is proposed as a promising technology to address
    these limitations by offering additional computation and storage resources for
    IoT systems. This is achieved by providing servers where IoT devices can offload
    their computation tasks [10], [11]. On the other hand, large-scale agricultural
    operations often involve the distribution of IoT devices across expansive areas.
    In such scenarios, challenges may emerge concerning communication, particularly
    with issues related to the limited reachability between IoT devices and MEC infrastructure.
    To address these challenges, a proposed solution involves the integration of a
    network comprising unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to enhance the capabilities
    of MEC [12], [13]. This approach aims to mitigate communication limitations stemming
    from the constrained transmission power of IoT devices and simultaneously improve
    network coverage. Due to the easy-to-deploy, cost-effective, and strong capabilities
    of the UAVs, UAV-aided MEC has attracted much attention and is widely utilized
    in smart agriculture to provide a high-quality line-of-sight (LoS) link to IoT
    devices [1], [3], [5], [14], [15], [16], [17]. The versatility and mobility exhibited
    by UAVs in response to changing weather conditions, alongside their straightforward
    deployment and economically viable maintenance costs, collectively establish UAVs
    as a proficient solution for supplying IoT devices with the necessary resources.
    Nevertheless, the UAVs themselves are quite often battery-powered which means
    their available energy is limited [6]. 1) Age of Information Besides energy, the
    freshness of information is another important aspect that needs to be considered
    in environmental monitoring and smart agriculture applications in which rapid
    protective and/or recovery actions are needed. Being more specific, within the
    realm of environmental monitoring applications and precision farming [18] in a
    UAV-aided MEC network, the IoT devices are strategically dispersed throughout
    specified regions to seamlessly gather real-time environmental data. Then the
    collected and pre-processed data by the UAVs finds its transmission route toward
    a localized MEC server; where a comprehensive analysis is conducted to facilitate
    the extraction of pertinent insights. These insights, in turn, play a pivotal
    role in fostering prompt agricultural decision-making and actions. The objectives
    can be the refinement of operations, the performance optimization, or the reduction
    of expenditure [1], [14], [19]. This expansion of smart agriculture’s scope ensures
    a secure and sustainable food supply chain, underpinned by contextual and situational
    awareness derived from real-time event processing [20]. Accordingly, such applications
    are characterized by their intensive computational demands and time-sensitive
    nature [1], [3], [5], [14], [18]. Concisely, the freshness of information becomes
    a critical factor that demands careful consideration. Packet delay and inter-delivery
    times, as two exemplary metrics that are commonly used to quantify the performance
    of real-time applications, are not adequate to represent the freshness of information
    received at the destination. Recently, age of information (AoI) has been proposed
    as a novel criterion to quantitatively evaluate the freshness of information [6],
    [17], [21]. For a flow of data packets, and with emphasis on the freshness of
    data at the destination, AoI is defined as the time elapsed from receiving the
    most recent packet belonging to that data-packet flow [22], [23]. 2) Network Function
    Virtualization (NFV) From the above discussion, in the context of UAV-enabled
    smart agriculture paradigm – which constitutes the focal point of this paper –
    UAVs are confronted with a substantial amount of data necessitating prompt processing.
    This scenario embodies a dynamic computational framework wherein a bunch of processing
    functions demands seamless implementation across both the UAVs and the local server
    [20], [24], [25]. NFV is a key technology for implementing and managing computing
    machines in a reliable, efficient, and robust manner [26]. The NFV virtualizes
    the network functions (NFs) and abstracts them from the physical hardware, which
    enables rapid service function chaining (SFC) and service provisioning in UAV-aided
    MEC applications [27]. Considering the data-intensive and computation-based application
    of smart agriculture, multiple computing functions in the form of virtual network
    functions (VNF) should be deployed sequentially and orderly to provide the processed
    data for the final decision-making at the local MEC-server. Utilizing NFV significantly
    enhances the agility in deploying and managing network components and improves
    the robustness and scalability of networks [27], [28]. Therefore, a critical challenge
    to address is the optimal and efficient placement of Virtual Network Functions
    (VNFs) and determining how to route information packets among VNF components over
    the available NFV infrastructure, i.e., UAVs and the MEC server. The decision
    to distribute and allocate VNFs between both UAVs and the server, rather than
    solely on one of them, aligns with the primary goal of the proposed scheme—to
    minimize the Age of Information (AoI) while maintaining energy efficiency. Network
    traffic and the workload on both UAVs and MEC servers fluctuate over time, while
    changing channel conditions between the parties necessitate adjustments in the
    required communication resources for packet forwarding. Furthermore, certain processing
    functions, such as compression, may alter the packet size, so the trade-off of
    performing these functions locally and sending the smaller packets with spending
    fewer communication resources versus doing the entire processing locally becomes
    pivotal. Consequently, the placement must dynamically adjust to new conditions
    to ensure the minimization of AoI and energy efficiency [28]. In light of this,
    a general condition has been considered where the VNFO can, depending on network
    conditions (processing node resources, service type, and channel conditions),
    decide on the optimal placement to minimize AoI and energy consumption. The work
    presented in [24] is a use-case of the practical implementation of smart agriculture
    in real-world contexts; where, the authors leverage a confluence of cloud computing,
    edge computing, and NFV technology to conceive a comprehensive framework tailored
    to the essential demands of soilless precision farming practiced within a fully-recirculating
    greenhouse [24]. 3) Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRL) The VNF placement and
    scheduling in our network settings can be expressed as integer programming with
    some constraints that reflect the service requirements and the network infrastructure’s
    restrictions. Nevertheless, this problem is NP-complete and there is no standard
    solver that can solve such problems in polynomial time [29], especially for large-scale
    networks where the required computation to find the optimal solution increases
    exponentially. Recently, machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligent
    (AI) based solutions appear as a viable way to solve such complex problems in
    polynomial time [17], [29], [30]. Since its inception in 2017 [31], Federated
    Learning (FL) has reshaped many emerging intelligent IoT systems toward advanced
    FL architecture. The distributed nature of FL, where some agents cooperatively
    train a global ML model without directly sharing the local data, makes FL an attractive
    alternative to traditional centralized ML schemes. To be more specific, FL by
    pushing intelligent ML functions to the network edge enhances the privacy and
    scalability of IoT applications and networks [30]. In this paper, our focus is
    on use cases in smart agriculture that require live streaming and analysis, such
    as surveillance and environmental monitoring. Specifically, we address the flexible
    dynamic orchestration of NFV-enabled SFCs within the context of delay-sensitive
    services. The approach involves distributing VNFs across processing nodes, utilizing
    UAVs and local MEC server in a UAV-aided MEC network. The objective is to perform
    SFC while ensuring the freshness of information by jointly minimizing AoI and
    total energy consumption throughout the network. Condensing the system model and
    the definition of the problem, we present the following key insights: In the realm
    of smart agriculture applications, real-time information is collected by IoT devices
    on a smart farm and transmitted through hovering UAVs to the local server. VNFs
    must be executed sequentially on the raw packets, as they represent split functionalities
    of a single processing job. Meanwhile, certain VNFs, such as compression, may
    potentially alter packet sizes. Various service types are assumed, each with its
    specific VNF chain. The challenge involves determining the optimal placement and
    scheduling of VNF chains on processing nodes (UAVs and the local server), accounting
    for processing time, transmission delay, and power consumption (both transmit
    and processing power) in a distributed manner. We will demonstrate analytically
    that the problem: Exhibits circular symmetry, wherein the optimal policies of
    the agents (UAVs) are identical. The local observations of the agents serve as
    sufficient statistics for determining the optimal policy, We will show how these
    two features will simplify the problem significantly. Subsequently, we present
    a novel solution for solving the modeled problem. The main contributions of our
    paper are summarized as follows: To the best of our knowledge this is the first
    time that the problem of dynamic orchestration of NFV-enabled SFCs in a multi-hop
    UAV-aided MEC network for smart agriculture is considered, while the problem is
    formulated as a joint AoI and Energy minimization. We formulate this joint optimization
    problem as a decentralized partially observable MDP (DEC-POMDP), where the parties
    are not aware of the true state and just make decisions based on their local observations.
    We adopted the structural feature of the problem and have analytically shown that
    under the satisfaction of certain symmetry conditions, the local observation of
    the parties (agents) would be a sufficient statistic for determining the optimal
    solution. As the formulated problem is NP-complete, we proposed a novel FL-based
    algorithm called Asynchronous FL Deep Q-Network (AFDQN) in which a set of distributed
    parties learn in parallel and aggregate their own experience through a coordinator.
    A Multi-hop network is considered, where the UAVs can offload their computing
    tasks to the other UAVs as well as the local MEC server. The rest of the paper
    is organized as follows: In Section II some state-of-the-art studies will be reviewed.
    Section III describes the system model and the main components of the system in
    detail. Section IV presents the problem definition and formulation. In Section
    V, the problem is expressed as a DEC-POMDP, and some analytical results are given
    that support our proposed FL-based solution presented in Section VI. The complexity
    analysis of the proposed algorithm is presented in Section VII. The effectiveness
    and performance of the proposed scheme is demonstrated in Section VIII. Finally,
    Section IX concludes the paper. SECTION II. Related Works In this section, we
    review some state-of-the-art studies on AoI and energy-aware UAV-aided MEC for
    smart agriculture. The prospects of using UAVs for smart agriculture are immense.
    Moreover, UAVs are easy to deploy and cost-effective which motivates their use
    in smart agriculture [1], [6], [32]. For a comprehensive survey on IoT-based smart
    agriculture and the emerging technologies mentioned in the previous section refer
    to [1]. In [13], Mozaffari et al. have considered the reliable design of IoT’s
    uplink communication in a scenario in which multiple UAVs are deployed to collect
    data from ground IoT devices. In particular, a framework for jointly optimizing
    the trajectory of the UAVs, IoT-to-UAV association, and IoT’s uplink power is
    proposed with the aim of minimizing the total energy consumption and mobility
    of the UAVs. However, in the formulated problem, the delay of the forwarded data
    across the UAV network is not considered. Nguyen et al. [5] have considered this
    issue as the problem of processing deadline-critical tasks which are fed to a
    network of hovering UAVs that support the IoT devices deployed in a smart farm.
    It is assumed that the smart farm is equipped with a multi-access MEC infrastructure.
    In such a circumstance, the energy-efficient monitoring problem is modeled as
    a multi-objective maximization problem which aims to maximize the number of tasks
    that are successfully processed before their deadline. Then, a Q-Learning-based
    solution is proposed to solve the problem. The same authors in [5] have extended
    their proposed scheme to a DQN-based solution [33] and to a multi-actor-based
    risk-sensitive RL approach [32]. Although, the goal of the aforementioned studies
    is to minimize the energy consumption in the network, however, the proposed solutions
    are basically centralized and the communication overhead of the centralized approaches
    is itself a source of energy waste. The AoI as a metric for determining the freshness
    of information has been used in some recent works On UAV-aided IoT networks [6],
    [17], [23], [34], [35]. Buyukates and Ulukus [34] examined a status update system
    where update packets require processing to extract embedded useful information.
    The source node sends information to a computation unit (CU) with a master node
    and worker nodes. The master node assigns tasks, aggregates results, and sends
    them back to the source node for updating. The analysis focuses on the age performance
    of various schemes in the presence of stragglers, considering i.i.d. exponential
    transmission delays and i.i.d. shifted exponential computation times. Then, the
    best scheme that minimizes the average age is presented. In [35], the authors
    analyzed the average age of information (AoI) and average peak AoI (PAoI) in a
    multiuser Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) system. The system considers three computing
    schemes: local computing, edge computing, and partial computing (where the computational
    tasks are partially performed at the edge and the remaining is performed by the
    local server). To address the complexity, upper and lower bounds on average AoI
    are provided, enabling an examination of optimal offloading decisions based on
    MEC system parameters. In [6], Han et al. modeled a UAV-aided IoT network using
    a Markov chain. The freshness of data packets is defined using AoI and they analyzed
    the IoT devices as first-come-first-served (FCFS) model and M/M/1 queue. Sun et
    al. [17], employed AoI to propose an AoI-energy-aware data collection scheme for
    IoT networks in which the UAVs are used to collect data. Here, AoI is used to
    quantify the temporal correlation among data packets. Then, an algorithm for determining
    the UAV’s flight speed, hovering locations, and allocated bandwidth to IoT devices
    is proposed that jointly minimizes energy consumption and the weighted sum of
    expected average AoI in the network. In [23], a UAV-aided wireless powered IoT
    scheme is proposed, where a UAV flies from a data center toward IoT sensory nodes
    to transfer energy and collect their information and then it returns back to the
    data center. The goal is to minimize the average AoI of the collected data from
    sensor modes. For such circumstances, an optimization problem is formulated, and
    then a suboptimal method is proposed that first decomposes the problem into two
    subproblems. The solution to the first subproblem is the input for the second
    subproblem. It is worth mentioning that the AoI is basically an end-to-end metric;
    Hence, even though the aforementioned works try to minimize the AoI, for the use
    cases in smart agriculture that the captured data needs some live processing before
    being turned into useful information, these approaches are not effective as they
    just consider the problem of finding the best data flow path. In the context of
    UAV-aided MEC for IoT networks, each service can be represented as a service function
    chain (SFC) consisting of ordered processing functions in the form of VNFs that
    can be geographically placed on to local MEC-server or the UAVs. However, in a
    network with numerous IoT devices and dynamic network load, the placement of VNF
    instances and routing among them in an optimal and efficient manner is a challenging
    problem [27], [28]. In the literature, this problem is referred to as the SFC
    dynamic orchestration problem (SFC-DOP) [27]. In [27], Liu et al. presented a
    DRL-based framework for dynamic SFC orchestration in IoT networks. Huang et al.
    in [36] dealt with the problem of scalability and flexibility of static orchestration
    of NFV-enabled SFCs. Then, a FL-based SFC orchestration is proposed which is scalable
    and benefits from low communication cost. Table 1 presents an overview of the
    previously mentioned studies, emphasizing the main topics they concentrated on.
    Although, in the literature, the UAV-aided MEC architecture is mainly proposed
    as a technique to compensate for the energy and computational limitations of IoT
    networks, however, existing solutions for NFV-enabled SFC require IoT nodes to
    exchange large volumes of local data with a centralized server or among the distributed
    agents. Considering the energy limitation of IoT devices and battery-powered UAVs,
    this significantly causes waste of the network energy. In this paper, we deal
    with this inconsistency and propose a novel FL-based solution for the dynamic
    orchestration of SFCs in a multi-hop and UAV-aided MEC network. To the best of
    our knowledge, this is the first time that the problem of dynamic orchestration
    of NFV-enabled SFCs in a multi-hop UAV-aided MEC network is considered. What makes
    our approach unique is the adoption of the inherent structural aspects of the
    problem, typical in most scenarios, to introduce a decentralized solution that
    is analytically demonstrated to be valid. The proposed method is asynchronous
    FL-based, enabling distributed parties to independently learn locally and subsequently
    contribute to the training of the global model asynchronously [38], [39]. In other
    words, the parties are allowed to directly share gradients with the coordinator
    (here, the MEC server) after every local update and asynchronous of the other
    parties. This further enhances the training speed and efficiency of our proposed
    approach [39]. The coordinator in turn can perform the aggregation and update
    the global model whenever an update from one of the distributed parties is received.
    This approach improves the whole system’s scalability and alleviates the straggler
    impact, i.e., users who may have slower performance [38]. TABLE 1 Summary of Related

    We consider a real-time IoT network for smart agriculture applications, where,
    the IoT network provides real-time monitoring and visibility to network operators
    by video/image streaming. For such circumstances, several use cases from remote
    monitoring to security can be considered. As it is depicted in Fig. 1, a set N
    of N IoT devices collect real-time information from a smart farm and send the
    packets to a local server. A UAV-aided MEC architecture is considered, where packets
    are forwarded through an Aerial Network consisting of U hovering UAVs toward the
    local server. We consider applications in which some processing functions, from
    primary processes (e.g., compression) to advanced ones (e.g., object recognition)
    must be sequentially performed on the raw packets. Each IoT device is associated
    with one of the UAVs in its range. U denote the set of all U UAVs in the network.
    The local server is indeed a MEC-server1 denoted by M . A set S={ S k } K k=1
    with |S|=K different service types is assumed. Each service type S k itself consists
    of a set F k ={ F k f } F k f=1 including F k different processing functions that
    should be performed on the packets of that service and F denotes a set of all
    processing functions of all services, F= ⋃ k∈S ( F k ) . The input and output
    packet sizes of the function f of service type k are ρ k f and ϱ k f , respectively.
    FIGURE 1. System model. Show All Let s k n ∈{0,1} denote the service type k∈S
    in IoT node n∈N is active, s k n =1 , or not, s k n =0 . In each IoT node one
    of the K different services is running, ∑ k∈S s k n =1,∀n∈N . To perform the processing
    functions, the MEC-server M and each UAV u is able to run F= ∑ k∈S F k different
    VNF types on their physical computing machine.2 The proposed architecture is based
    on ETSI-NFV standard [40] which is a globally accepted architecture for implementing
    the NFV. According to ETSI-NFV, in each physical machine (processing node) p∈U∪M
    (All U UAVs and the local server M), the VNF manager (VNFM) is responsible to
    manage its computing and storage resources among the VNFs it hosts. The total
    available resources at processing node p is indicated by C p , the computing capacity
    in Hz, and B p , the memory capacity in Byte. The VNF orchestrator (VNFO), hosted
    by the local server, places and schedules the chain of VNFs through Aerial Domain
    and Local (MEC) Server. For a summary of the key symbols and variables used in
    the system model and problem formulation, refer to Table 2. TABLE 2 Key Symbols
    and Variables B. VNF Placement and Scheduling We consider a discrete-time system
    with two hierarchical timing levels. First, the time is divided into equal time
    slots TS with duration T indexed by t=1,2,… . On top of that, we have the VNF-scheduling
    time slots t ~ with duration T ˜ that is multiples of T , and it is a single round
    of VNF placement and scheduling update. At the beginning of each time slot t ~
    , the VNFO updates the VNF placements. Each UAV u segregates data packets from
    IoT nodes sharing the same service type, say k , into a packet-flow Υ k u (t)
    , which it then transmits across the aerial network to the local server. The set
    F k ={ V fk } F k f=1 of F k different VNFs (processing functions) must be performed
    on data packets of the IoT nodes with service type k . At the beginning of each
    VNFO-level time slot t ~ , the VNFO determines the set of processing nodes Δ k
    u ( t ~ ) that participate in serving the k th service packet-flow Υ k u (t) of
    UAV u at t th TS. Each selected processing node p∈U∪M that belongs to Δ k u (
    t ~ ) performs a subset B k up ( t ~ ) of all functions F k that is supposed to
    be performed on the packet flow of service type k belongs to UAV u : B k up (
    t ~ )={ F k f  :  f ˙ k up ≤f≤ f ¨ k up }, B k up ( t ~ )⊆ F k , (1) View Source
    where f ˙ k up (S) and f ¨ k up (E) are the first and the last function (VNF)
    that p performs on the packet flow of service type k of UAV u . In summary, for
    each packet-flow Υ k u (t) , the VNFO selects and schedules the processing nodes
    that handle F k . These nodes can be each one of any other UAVs (intra-domain
    offloading) or local server (inter-domain offloading). Remark 1:Let P to−do p
    ( t ~ )={(u,k,f) : f∈ F k u is running on p} indicate a set of all assigned VNFs
    to the processing node p∈U∪M . We assume all assigned VNFs P to−do p ( t ~ ) to
    processing node p should be finished in a single round of VNF scheduling t ~ .
    Fig. 2 provides a comprehensive representation of crucial elements related to
    the proposed orchestration solution and the communication dynamics within the
    network. Operating at two distinct timing levels, the figure elucidates: 1) The
    VNFO timing (Tier 1), emphasizing interactions pivotal for establishing the proposed
    orchestration solution, and 2) the network-wide communication (Tier 2), encompassing
    all entities within the network. FIGURE 2. Network-wide timing model. Show All
    The upper segment of the figure illustrates how UAV 1 manages received packet
    flows from IoT nodes, accommodating two distinct service types. Following the
    assumed VNFO policy in a single round of VNF placement and scheduling, it is evident
    that for packets of service type 1, UAV1 processes them and subsequently forwards
    them to UAV3. UAV3, after performing the assigned VNFs, then forwards the packets
    to the local server, i.e., the final destination. Conversely, for packets of service
    type 2, UAV1 initiates some initial processing and then directly forwards them
    to the local server, where all remaining VNFs are executed. The lower section
    of the figure is dedicated to illustrating VNFO level operation, depicting control
    packets exchanged between the local server and agents for the training of the
    VNFO model. Further clarification on this VNFO communication is postponed to subsequent
    sections within the article. C. Communication (Access) Network There are three
    communication links among the network nodes: the wireless links between IoT nodes
    and an aerial network consisting of UAVs, the UAV-to-UAV wireless links, and the
    wireless link between the UAVs and the local terrestrial server. Let random process
    g nu (t)∈C denote the channel loss between IoT node n∈N and UAV u∈U , then the
    achievable bit rate of node n in up-link direction at time instant t will be R
    nu (t)= w n log 2 (1+ p nu | g nu (t)| σ 2 ),∀n∈N,u∈U , where w n and σ 2 denote
    the channel bandwidth of IoT device n and the noise variance, respectively, and
    p nu is the transmission power level. The channel between IoT nodes and UAVs and
    between UAVs and the local server can be modeled as an air-to-ground channel model
    [41]. According to this model, the path loss, g nu can be calculated as [37],
    g nu (t)= ( 4πf c ) 2 d 2 (t) η e , (2) View Source where f , c , and d are frequency
    of operation, speed of light, and distance between the transmitter and receiver,
    respectively; and η e is the average of excessive path loss in two cases of existing
    a LoS path, η LoS e , and non-LoS case, η nLoS e , η e = p LoS × η LoS e +(1−
    p LoS )× η nLoS e , (3) View Source where p LoS is the probability that a LoS
    path exists and can be closely approximated as [37], p LoS = 1 1+aexp−b(ψ−a) ,
    (4) View Source where, a and b are environment-related parameters. Similarly,
    in the downlink direction, the achievable bit rate of the link between UAV u∈U
    and MEC server M at time instant t will be R uM (t)= w uM log 2 (1+ p uM | g uM
    (t)| σ 2 ),∀u∈U , where w uM denotes the channel bandwidth, σ 2 is the noise variance,
    p uM is the transmission power level, and random process g uM (t)∈C denotes the
    channel Loss at time t . Finally, the UAV-to-UAV wireless channel also follows
    the same mathematical model, however, the only difference is that the probability
    of existing LoS is equal to 1, p LoS =1 . For each UAV u and service type k ,
    τ k u (t) is defined as the expectation value of IoT access network delay with
    respect to transmission rate R nu (t) , τ k u (t)= E R nu [ τ k nu (t)], τ k nu
    (t)= D nu /C+ Λ k nu / R nu (t), (5) View Source where, E R nu denotes the expectation
    with respect to R nu , D nu is distance between IoT node n∈N and UAV u∈U and Λ
    k nu is the packet length of service type S k ∈S . For the aerial radio links,
    Let random process g u u ´ (t)∈C denote the channel power gain between UAV u∈U
    and UAV (or local server M) u ´ ∈U∪M , then the achievable bit rate of the link
    at time instant t will be R u u ´ = w u u ´ log 2 (1+ p u u ´ | g u u ´ (t)| σ
    2 ),∀n∈N,u∈U∪M , where w u u ´ denote the channel bandwidth between UAV u , and
    UAV (or local server) u ´ , σ 2 is the noise variance, and p u u ´ is the transmission
    power level. In the following sections, we will focus on the VNFO’s functionality,
    and resource allocation of the radio access part is beyond the scope of this paper;
    hence, without loss of generality, we assume a fixed power and bandwidth allocated
    to all the participating nodes. SECTION IV. Problem Formulation Let χ fk pu (
    t ~ )∈{0,1} denote whether the processing node p at time slot t is selected to
    run VNF function f on the packet of the k th service type of UAV u : χ fk pu (
    t ~ )= { 1, 0, if p∈ Δ k u ( t ~ )andf∈ B k pu ( t ~ ) otherwise ∀k∈S,u∈U. (6)
    View Source For each service type k∈S of UAV u , only one of the processing nodes
    (UAVs or MEC-server) must be selected for serving each function f∈ F k : ∑ p∈U∪M
    χ fk pu ( t ~ )=1,∀f∈ F k , ∑ p∈U∪M χ fk pu ( t ~ )=0,∀f∄ F k . (7) View Source
    The relation (7), both left and right expressions together, implies that the packets
    belonging to the service packet-flows travel a loop-free route. Each packet belongs
    to packet-flow Υ k u (t) needs a specific computational capacity c fk in CPU cycle.
    Assuming that all the processing capacity of processing node p in a single time
    slot with duration T ˜ is C p T ˜ , to be assured that the computing capacity
    of the selected processing node is enough to serve the assigned VNFs and the scheduler
    does not exceed the processing node’s budget, the following condition at each
    VNF-scheduling time slot t ~ should be satisfied: ∑ u∈U ∑ k∈S ∑ f∈ F k 1 P to−do
    p ( t ~ ) (u,k,f) c fk ≤ C p T ˜ ,∀p∈U∪M. (8) View Source The same condition also
    needs to be fulfilled regarding the storage capacity requirement b fk (in Bytes):
    ∑ u∈U ∑ k∈S ∑ f∈ F k 1 P to−do p ( t ~ ) (u,k,f) b fk ≤ B p ,∀p∈U∪M (9) View Source
    where B p is the total amount of available storage capacity of the processing
    node p . A. Age of Information In order to quantify the freshness of the received
    packet at the destination, the AoI metric is adopted. As soon as an IoT node has
    a packet to send, it connects to its serving UAV and sends packets.3 For each
    packet flow of service type k that UAV u∈U receives directly from the IoT nodes
    that are connected to it and running this service type, the arrival time t k u
    is defined as the time elapsed from the beginning of the time slot t in which
    any packet has arrived in. Let Θ k u (t) denote the AoI of the packet-flow of
    service type k in UAV u , it can be calculated as, Θ k u (t)={ τ k u +T− t k u
    , Θ k u (t−1)+T, if  α k u (t)=1 if  α k u (t)=0 ∀k∈S,u∈U (10) View Source where
    binary variable α k u (t)∈{0,1} indicates whether any new packet of service flow
    k at TS t is received, α k u (t)=1 , or not, α k u (t)=0 . By definition, for
    every time slot t in which the UAV does not receive a new packet from a service
    packet flow, the AoI of that service packet flow increases by T . On each received
    packet from IoT node n with service type k , the set F n k of VNFs (processing
    functions) should be performed. As stated above, the VNFO determines the set of
    processing nodes p∈ Δ k u ( t ~ ) that participate in performing the VNFs on packet-flow
    Υ k u (t) by performing the set B k up ( t ~ ) of VNFs. B k up ( t ~ )=∅ means
    p hosts none of the required VNFs of Υ k u (t) . Let Δ k u ( t ~ )={ p 1 , p 2
    ,…, p L } denote the sequence of all UAVs that are already selected to sequentially
    do the chain of VNFs on the received packets of service type k . The processing
    time of every packet of this flow will be, Φ k u (t)= ∑ p v ∈ Δ k u ( t ~ ) ⎛
    ⎝ ⎜ ⌈ τ fk p v−i p v (t) T ⌉T+ ∑ ϑ∈ B k u p v ( t ~ ) (⌈ θ k ϑ T ⌉T ⎞ ⎠ ⎟ ), ∀k∈S,u∈U
    τ fk p v−i p v (t)= D p v−i p v /C+ Λ p v−i p v ( F k f )/ R p v−i p v (t) F k
    f = f ¨ k u p v−i , (11) View Source where θ k ϑ is the run time of ϑ th VNF for
    service type k , Λ p v−i p v ( F k f ) is the packet length of service type S
    k ∈S after doing the last VNF f ¨ k u p v−1 of the chain in p v−1 , and, Assuming
    that the queueing delay is negligible, τ fk p v−1 p v is total transmission delay
    between p v−1 and p v consists of propagation delay and transmission delay. If
    the binary variable β k u ( t ~ )∈{0,1} indicates whether the VNF scheduling (at
    VNF-scheduling time slots t ~ ) for the flow of packets belong to service type
    k of UAV u was successful, then, the AoI at the Local server will be, Π k u (t)={
    Θ k u (t)+ Φ k u (t), Π k u (t−1)+ T ˜ , if  β k u ( t ~ )=1 if β k u ( t ~ )=0
    ∀k∈S,u∈U. (12) View Source Note that T ˜ is the duration of a single round of
    VNF placement and scheduling. B. Energy Consumption The energy consumption of
    the network in the uplink direction can be calculated as, P UL (t)= ∑ n∈N ∑ k∈S
    ∑ u∈U s k n p nu Λ k nu / R nu (t), (13) View Source where Λ k nu / R nu (t) is
    the transmission time between IoT node n , with service type k , and UAV u at
    TS t . The other energy-consuming part of the access network is transmission among
    the processing nodes. If we represent the energy consumption in the aerial domain
    (including UAV-to-UAV and UAV-to-MEC links) at TS t with P Aerial (t) , then it
    will be as, P Aerial (t)= τ fk p v−i p v (t)= F k f = ∑ u∈U ∑ k∈S ∑ p v ∈ Δ k
    u p p v−i p v τ fk p v−i p v (t), D p v−i p v /C+ Λ p v−i p v ( F k f )/ R p v−i
    p v (t), f ¨ k u p v−i , (14) View Source where Λ p v−i p v ( F k f ) , f ¨ k
    u p v−1 and τ fk p v−1 p v are defined like (11). Finally, if Ψ k ϑ denotes the
    power each machine, that hosts the ϑ th VNF of service type k , consumes to run
    this VNF on each packet of this service type, then, the total network-wide required
    energy for performing the VNFs across a single packet of all service type can
    be calculated as follows: P NFV = ∑ u∈U ∑ k∈S ∑ p v ∈ Δ k u ∑ ϑ∈ B k u p v Ψ k
    ϑ θ k ϑ . (15) View Source In a single term, P NFV represents the energy consumption
    resulting from VNFs processing. Using (13)–(15), the total energy consumption
    of the network to process a single packet across all the service types belonging
    to all UAVs would be, P Total (t)= P UL (t)+ P Aerial (t)+ P NFV . (16) View Source
    The UAVs use a battery, hence their available energy to do the processes and perform
    the required communications is limited. Therefore, we need an energy-efficient
    VNFO solution with minimum communication overhead. A centralized ML method will
    be optimal, but it requires a large communication transaction to share the local
    observation with the central controller. Another drawback of adopting centralized
    architecture is that the centralized coordinator is not scalable and from the
    processing and communication viewpoint is a single point of failure. Therefore,
    in this paper, we deal with proposing a solution for the following problem of
    distributed NFV orchestration through the UAVs as distributed VNFO agents. Problem
    1 (Distributed VNFO for Joint AoI and Energy Minimization):Considering the service
    requirements of IoT nodes, UAVs/MEC-server available resources, and the condition
    of access networks, what is the optimal strategy of VNF placement and scheduling
    in each UAV to jointly minimize the average AoI and total energy consumption at
    the Local Server: Minimize χ fk pu ( t ~ ) s.t. γ AoI [ 1 UK ∑ u∈U ∑ k∈S Π k u
    (t)]+ γ E P total (t), ∑ p∈U∪M χ fk pu ( t ~ )=1,∀f∈ F k , ∑ p∈U∪M χ fk pu ( t
    ~ )=0,∀f∄ F k , ∑ u∈U ∑ k∈S ∑ f∈ F k 1 P to−do p ( t ~ ) (u,k,f) c fk ≤ C p T,
    ∀p∈U∪M, ∑ u∈U ∑ k∈S ∑ f∈ F k 1 P to−do p ( t ~ ) (u,k,f) b fk ≤ B p , ∀p∈U∪M.
    (17) View Source In each VNFO-level time slot T ˜ the orchestrator sequentially
    decides on the chain of VNFs of the service flows belonging to UAVs. For a class
    of stochastic sequential decision-making problems, the Markov Decision Process
    (MDP) has been a powerful framework for the mathematical formulation and study
    of this type of problems. Another point that is worth mentioning is that our proposed
    method in Section VI is FL-based where the UAVs follow the same model trained
    cooperatively. Therefore, minimizing the average AoI over UAVs or minimizing the
    maximum value of AoI over UAVs are basically the same. Depending on the environment
    state, the MDP output will be the best action (or at least the best upon the history
    of the observations and actions) which maximizes a specific utility function [42].
    For the case that the state is not fully observable to the deciding agent or the
    agent’s observations are exposed to noise or some source (sort) of uncertainties,
    another extended class of decision-making processes called Partially Observable
    MDP (POMDP) is adopted [43]. Both MDP and POMDP in their original scope are defined
    centralized [42], [43]. Partially Observable Stochastic Game (POSG) is the extended
    version of POMDP in which a set of distributed agents are involved in the decision-making
    process [44], [45]. By definition, if every agent has the same individual reward
    function, the POSG model becomes the Decentralized POMDP (DEC-POMDP) [45]. In
    the following two sections, first, we show how the problem can be modeled as a
    DEC-POMDP and then we will present our proposed method to solve the developed
    DEC-POMDP. SECTION V. DEC-POMDP Formulation In a multi-agent MDP with state uncertainty,
    a DEC-POMDP is formally defined as a tuple with the following definition. Definition
    1 (DEC-POMDP Model):DEC-POMDP G with a set U of U agents is defined as a tuple
    G=⟨U,S, b 0 ,A,O,T,O,R⟩ , where S is the finite set of global environment states,
    b 0 is the probability of the environment initially being in state s∈S , A= ∏
    u∈U A u is the joint action of all agents, where A u is the set of actions available
    to agent u , O= ∏ u∈U O u is joint observation, where O u is the observations
    available to agent u , T is the transition function T :  ⋃ s∈S (s×A(s))×S→[0,1]
    , where T( s ´ |s,A(s)) is defined as the transition probability from state s
    to s ´ by doing joint action A(s) , O is the observation function O :  ⋃ s∈S (s×A(s))×O→[0,1]
    , where O(O|s,A(s)) is defined as the joint observation at state s by doing joint
    action A(s) , R={ r u } U−1 u=0 is a set of reward functions r u  :  ⋃ s∈S (s×A(s))→R
    , where r u (s,A(s)) is defined as the reward received by u when A(s) is executed
    at the global state s . In a DEC-POMDP, each agent u∈U based on its local observation
    o u ∈ O u and a local policy π u performs an independent action a u ∈ A u . In
    each partially observable state s , the joint action A(s)= ∏ u∈U a u (s) from
    the joint policy P= ∏ u∈U π u determines the next global state s ´ and joint observations
    O according to transition and observation probability of T( s ´ |s,A(s)) and O(O|s,A(s))
    , respectively. According to Problem 1, our purpose is to find the best choice
    for the sets Δ k u (t) of processing nodes p and B k up (t) of the VNF chains
    for serving packet-flow Υ k u (t) of any service type k∈S of UAVs u∈U in a distributed
    manner. Remark 2 (Source of Uncertainties):We have considered a multi-hop network
    architecture, as depicted in Fig. 3, in which, 1) each agent u is not aware of
    the other agents’ observation o −u  (−u refers to all the agents except u , o
    −u = ∏ u ´ ≠u o u ´ ) , nor the action a −u ,4 2) each agent observes the result
    of doing its own action and the actions of the other agents, while it is not aware
    of the global state nor the action of the other agents. Therefore, according to
    Definition 1, it can be inferred that Problem 1 in its decentralized form is a
    DEC-POMDP. FIGURE 3. System model as a DEC-POMDP. Show All In DEC-POMDP, each
    agent based on its actions and observations creates a local database that in time
    t can be represented as h u ( t ~ )={ a u ( t ~ −1), o u ( t ~ ) } t ~ t ~ =1
    ,∀u∈U , where a u ( t ~ −1) and o u ( t ~ ) are the action of u at time slot t
    ~ −1 and its corresponding observation at t ~ . All the information is available
    to all the U agents at time t ~ defines as the joint history H( t ~ )= ∏ u∈U h
    u ( t ~ )={A( t ~ −1),O( t ~ ) } t ~ t ~ =1 . The POMDP state is hidden from the
    agents. Hence, the agents would not be able to choose their actions based on knowing
    the true state. The standard approach for dealing with POMDPs is to find a solution
    to the fully observable equivalent belief-MDP [43]. Where, belief B(s, t ~ )=P(s(
    t ~ )=s|H( t ~ ),B(0)),∀s∈S defines as a probability distribution over the state
    space of the original POMDP knowing the joint history H( t ~ ) , i.e., all the
    available information from the sequence of interactions that the agents have had
    until now,where B(0) is the initial value the belief state function. Belief state
    function B(s, t ~ ) is known as sufficient statistic for the history H( t ~ )
    [45]. Upon performing a new interaction at t ~ +1 , the belief value is updated
    from the belief point at time t considering the new interaction {A( t ~ −1),O(
    t ~ )} . Despite the current hidden state, in DEC-POMDP the agents need to infer
    the action (the policy) of the other agents. This leads to the definition of multi-agent
    belief function [46] with the following definition, b u  :  ⋃ s∈S (s× π −u (s))→[0,1],∀u∈U
    b u, t ~ (s, π −u )=P(s( t ~ )=s, π −u | h u ( t ~ ), b u (0)), π −u = ∏ u ´ ∈U,
    u ´ ≠u π u ´ . (18) View Source As it is evident, the multi-agent belief function
    is defined in a space that is a combination of the hidden global state s and joint
    policy π −u of the other agents. From Bellman expectation equation [47], the action-value
    function Q π u, t ~ [(s, π −u ), a π u ] is the expected return starting from
    state hidden state s , taking action a π u according to policy π u , while the
    other agents follow the joint policy π −u , Q π u, t ~ [(s, π −u ), a π u, t ~
    ]= E{ R u [(s, π −u ), a π u, t ~ ] + γ u Q π u, t ~ +1 [( s ´ , π −u ), a π u,
    t ~ +1 ]}. (19) View Source where the action-value function decomposed into immediate
    reward plus discounted action-value of the successor state, and γ u is the discount
    factor of agent u . With some mathematical manipulation, (19) can be written as,
    Q π u, t ~ [(s, π −u ), a π u, t ~ ]= R u [(s, π −u ), a π u, t ~ ] + γ u ∑ (
    o u , o −u )∈O O[ o u , o −u |s,( a π u , a −π −u )] ∑ s ´ ∈S T[ s ´ |s,( a −π
    −u )] × ∑ ( a π u , a −π −u )∈A π u ( a π u | s ´ ) Q π u,t [( s ´ , π −u ( o
    −u )), a ´ π u, t ~ +1 ( o u )]. (20) View Source Using (18), for a given belief
    state function b u, t ~ (s, π −u ) , the action-value function Q π u, t ~ ( b
    u, t ~ , a π u, t ~ ) will be, Q π u, t ~ ( b u, t ~ , a π u, t ~ )= ∑ s∈S ∑ π
    −u b u, t ~ (s, π −u ) Q π u, t ~ [(s, π −u ), a π u, t ~ ]. (21) View Source
    For an enough large value of t ~  ( t ~ →∞) , the goal is to find the optimal
    policy π ∗ u among available policies π u which leads to the optimal Q-value (action-value)
    function, Q ∗ u, t ~ ( b u, t ~ , a u, t ~ )=arg max π Q π u, t ~ ( b u, t ~ ,
    a π u, t ~ ). (22) View Source There is no straightforward solution for the aforementioned
    DEC-POMDP problem. Among decentralized methods, multi-agent solutions also need
    a large volume of communication overhead between the agents to share their local
    observations to converge. FL does not have the communication overhead of the centralized
    techniques and also does not necessitate the agents to share all of the data and
    local observations to converge. Although this specification is for providing privacy,
    in our problem it provides us with the gain of energy efficiency that arises because
    the agents (UAVs) do not need to share all of their observations. A few efforts,
    [45], [48], [49], have been made in the literature to capture and exploit some
    structural specifications of the understudied system (application) to find or
    at least simplify the problem of finding optimal policy (22). One of these works
    is one presented by Yongacoglu et al. [48], in which the authors have developed
    a class of POSGs that is characterized by symmetry across players in terms of
    cost and state dynamics. In view of this research, within the APPENDIX, we introduce
    a class of Symmetric DEC-POMDP and prove that Problem 1belongs to this class and
    is Circularly Symmetric. This implies that the best agents’ policy, π ∗ are the
    same, { π u } U−1 u=0 = π ∗ . In essence, this necessitates a distributed solution
    to determine the best policy while ensuring uniformity across all agents. Furthermore,
    in accordance with the circular symmetry characteristic of the problem, in Corollary
    22 we prove that local observations serve as sufficient statistics for each agent
    to ascertain the best policy. Corollary 22 guarantees that the local observation
    h u ( t ~ ) serves as a sufficient statistic to determine the optimal policy π
    ∗ for the agents (UAVs). This implies that the information encapsulated in the
    local observations of the individual agents is comprehensive enough to determine
    the optimal policy π ∗ . While this corollary does not suggest a particular method
    for identifying the optimal policy, it is promising and justifies our proposed
    FL-based algorithm in which the agents collaboratively engage in training a globally
    shared model. This approach aligns with the notion that leveraging decentralized
    insights from each agent’s local observations can contribute to the derivation
    of an effective and globally optimal policy because their observations are sufficient
    statistics. Capitalizing on the promising findings in this section, the subsequent
    section introduces our proposed approach to address Problem 1. SECTION VI. Symmetry-aided
    Asynchronous Federated DQN Framework In this section, we introduce our proposed
    Asynchronous Federated Deep Q-Network (AFDQN) algorithm and the components we
    have used in the proposed model as depicted in Fig. 4. In traditional RL, the
    problem is modeled as an MDP consisting of a tuple {s( t ~ ),a( t ~ ),r( t ~ ),s(
    t ~ +1)} . At each decision-making time t ~ , the agent is at state s( t ~ ) and
    takes an action a( t ~ ) based on a policy π that causes a state transition from
    s( t ~ ) to s( t ~ +1) while an immediate reward r( t ~ ) incurred. For our POMDP
    case in which the true state of the network is hidden, the true state s( t ~ )
    is replaced with belief-state b( t ~ ) . Mainly, the RL aims to guide the agent
    to find the best policy π ∗ defined as the best mapping from observation o( t
    ~ ) to action a( t ~ ) that maximizes the expected cumulative discounted future
    rewards R( t ~ )= E π { ∑ ∞ l=t γ (l− t ~ ) r(l)} , where γ∈[0,1] is a discount
    factor indicating how much future rewards is important. For our DEC-POMDP problem,
    this relation maps to (19). FIGURE 4. Block diagram of the proposed Asynchronous
    Federated-DQN (AFDQN). Show All A. Deep Q-Network (DQN) Part To estimate Q-value
    functions (21), deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is deployed, where Q-values
    are predicted using deep neural networks (DNNs) as function approximators. The
    estimated Q -functions are represented by { Q u ( o u ( t ~ ), a u ( t ~ ); θ
    u ( t ~ )) } U−1 u=0 , where the parameter θ u ( t ~ ) represents the weights
    of the agent u ’s neural network (NN). The updated value of θ u ( t ~ ) is used
    to approximate the true values of Q u ( t ~ ) [21], [50]. Let’s define the loss
    function L( θ u ( t ~ )) as the expectation value of the mean squared error of
    the estimated Q-value Q u ( o u ( t ~ ), a u ( t ~ ); θ u ( t ~ )) from the target
    value y( t ~ ) [21], L( θ u ( t ~ ))=E[(y( t ~ )− Q u ( o u ( t ~ ), a u ( t ~
    ); θ u ( t ~ )) ) 2 ], (23) View Source where, y( t ~ )= r u ( t ~ )+γ max a u
    ( t ~ +1) Q u ( o u ( t ~ +1), a u ( t ~ +1); θ u ( t ~ )) and a u ( t ~ +1) indicates
    the agent’s action generated by the DNN at t ~ +1 , given the observation o u
    ( t ~ +1) . At each iteration, the deep Q -function approximator is trained to
    learn the best estimate of the Q-function by minimizing the loss function L( θ
    u ( t ~ )) . To improve the stability of the algorithm and cope with samples correlation,
    as depicted in Fig. 4, two novel techniques, namely Fixed Target Network [51]
    and Experience Replay Buffer [52] are deployed, respectively. Utilizing these
    two techniques, the loss function L( θ u ( t ~ )) can be written as L( θ u ( t
    ~ )) = E D [( r u ( t ~ )+γ max a u ( t ~ +1) Q u (b( t ~ +1), a u ( t ~ +1);
    θ ´ u ( t ~ )) − Q u ( o u ( t ~ ), a u ( t ~ ); θ u ( t ~ )) ) 2 ], (24) View
    Source where θ ´ u ( t ~ ) denotes the target network parameters, and the expectation
    E D is taken over the randomly selected mini-batches of samples from the replay
    buffer D . B. Federated Learning Part As it is illustrated in Fig. 4, we have
    two main entities, the set U={0,1,…,U−1} of UAVs that are our distributed agents
    or in FL terminology, the agents, and the coordinator that in our model is local
    server (MEC-server). FL allows the UAVs (agents) to train a shared global model
    parameterized by θ g that is an exact copy of the agents’ local model { θ u }
    u=U−1 u=0 using their own dataset { D u } u=U−1 u=0 , while the original data
    remains in UAVs. After local training, agents share their local model updates
    with the coordinator. The coordinator then aggregates the received updates to
    build the global model θ g . As a result, relying on the distributed data training
    at the agents, the local server is able to enhance the training performance without
    significant communication overhead as it just needs an update of the local model
    parameters, not the agents’ local data. The federated learning procedure of our
    proposed method includes the following key steps. 1) Distributed Local Training
    Primarily, the local server initializes the global model, θ g,0 , and transmit
    it to the agents. Upon receiving θ g,0 , during VNFO time slots t ~ the agents
    interact with environment and train their local model { θ u ( t ~ ) } u=U−1 u=0
    using their own data set { D u ( t ~ ) } u=U−1 u=0 by minimizing a loss function
    { L u ( θ u ( t ~ )) } u=U−1 u=0 , θ ∗ u =arg min π u L u ( θ u (( t ~ ))),∀u∈U.
    (25) View Source Then, the agents upload their local update on { θ u ( t ~ ) }
    u=U−1 u=0 to the coordinator for aggregation. 2) Model Aggregation After collecting
    the agents’ local model updates, the next step is aggregating them into a new
    version of the global model which is performed by the coordinator by solving the
    following optimization problem. Problem 2 (Model Aggregation):Given the local
    model updates { θ u ( t ~ ) } u=U−1 u=0 of all agents, and knowing the local loss
    functions { L u (⋅) } u=U−1 u=0 , what is the optimal strategy for aggregating
    the local model that minimizes the global loss, θ ∗ g , L ∗ g =arg min L g , θ
    g L g ( ∏ u∈U L u ( θ g (( t ~ )))). (26) View Source According to Problem 2,
    θ ∗ g is the optimal value for θ g with having the local updates in hand; and
    L ∗ g is the best function (the best method) for aggregating the local loss function.
    The loss-aggregation function L ∗ g indicates the relative contribution of each
    agent on the global model, however, there is not a fixed method for determining
    this function and it depends mostly on the structure and specific features of
    the problem. Corollary 1:According to Lemma 2, The best setting for loss functions
    is (24) and { L u (⋅) } u=U−1 u=0 =L(⋅) , The optimal way for aggregating the
    local updates is averaging among the agent’s contributions, thus (25) can be rewritten
    as, θ ∗ g = ∑ u∈U ω u θ u , where ω u represents the relative contribution of
    each agent on the global model. After the derivation of a new update of θ g the
    coordinator broadcasts it to all agents. Upon receiving the update from the coordinator,
    the agents upgrade their local model accordingly. Until achieving a predefined
    level of accuracy or convergence of the global loss function, this process is
    continued. C. Asynchronous Networking The communication among the network entities
    follows the time slots t , but slot scheduling in which the agents share their
    own local model with the coordinator is distributed and asynchronous. Upon receiving
    an update, the coordinator aggregates it with the global model and updates the
    agents with the newly updated global model. In this way, we do not impose a strict
    constraint on synchronous communication with the local server (the coordinator).
    This significantly decreases the networking overhead in comparison with synchronous
    federation among distributed agents. During the training phase, we consider episodes
    in which the agent presets to a random initialization setting and starts interaction
    with the environment, and learns from its experience. Each episode contains T
    ˆ VNF scheduling round t ~ . In the deployment phase, the stream of packets that
    belong to different services is assigned based on an optimally determined VNF
    placement/scheduling policy. To avoid service interruption any fine-tuning and
    policy adaption to environmental changes, including the time the algorithm spends
    on fine-tuning and finding the optimal solution by coordinating multiple agents
    to train the global model, can be done in parallel. Definition 2 (Global Update
    Period):global update period 1≤η≤ T ˆ is defined as the period of updating the
    coordinator by the agents. We have two special settings, AFDQN-SGD ( η=1 ): In
    this case, every VNF scheduling slot t ~ , the agent sends the locally calculated
    SGD, ∇ θ L u ( θ u ( t ~ )) to the coordinator. Then, the coordinator uses the
    received local data to perform one step of gradient descent: θ g ( t ~ +1)= θ
    g ( t ~ )− γ ˙ ∇ θ L u ( θ u ( t ~ )). (27) View Source AFDQN-Avg ( η= T ˆ ):
    In this case, only one time during each episode, the agent sends the whole parameter
    θ u ( t ~ ) to the coordinator. Then, the coordinator updates θ g ( t ~ ) accordingly,
    θ g ( t ~ +1)=(1− γ ¨ ) θ g ( t ~ )+ γ ¨ θ u ( t ~ ), (28) View Source where,
    γ ˙ and γ ¨ are AFDQN-SGD and AFDQN-Avg forgetting factors, respectively. Introducing
    the forgetting factors γ ˙ and γ ¨ allows for the adjustment of learning rates
    during model updates. Rather than updating the global model instantly upon receiving
    a local update, it is beneficial to employ a weighted average approach, considering
    both the most recent update and the previous value of the Agent’s NN weight θ
    g . This approach, known as Asynchronous Weight Averaging [53] in the literature,
    proves advantageous in alleviating the impact of outdated updates, commonly referred
    to as stale weights, and consequently, it enhances overall stability. The only
    point is that the forgetting factors should be chosen small enough. Another worth
    mentioning point is that the AFDQN-SGD and a centralized approach doing mini-batch
    SGD in the local server are essentially different as the former is asynchronous,
    distributed, and fully based on local data. The details of the proposed AFDQN
    algorithm are described in Algorithm 1. Algorithm 1: AFDQN- η Algorithm Show All
    Considering our optimization problem, for each agent u∈U at VNF scheduling round
    t ~ , we define the observation space O u , the action space A u , and the reward
    function R u as follows: Observation: We define the observation space as a vector
    of: 1) CPU and storage requested by the local service flows { Υ k u (t)|t= t ~
    } k as { c fk (t)|t= t ~ } f,k and { b fk (t)|t= t ~ } f,k , respectively, 2)
    available CPU { C p } p and storage { B p } p of the processing nodes, 3) service
    arrival time { t k u } k , and 4) the transmission rate { R u p ´ } U∖ u ´ ∪M
    of the links between agent u and the other processing nodes. Therefore, the observation
    o u ( t ~ ) can be written as O u ( t ~ )= {{ c fk (t) } f,k ,{ b fk (t) } f,k
    , { C p } p ,{ B p } p ,{ t k u } k ,{ R u p ´ } U∖u⋃M } t= t ~ . (29) View Source
    Action: The action space is defined as all possible placement of the required
    VNFs for service flows { Υ k u (t)|t= t ~ } k as A u ( t ~ )={ χ fk pu ( t ~ )},∀p∈U∪M,k∈S,f∈
    F k . (30) View Source Reward: Our objective is to orchestrate the VNFs in a way
    that jointly minimizes the average AoI and total energy consumption over the network.
    So we define the reward as a linear combination of three terms as follows: R u

    View Source where δ NFV , δ AoI and δ E are the normalization factors for NFV
    scheduling result, AoI, and the energy consumption, respectively; ζ k u ( t ~
    ) is defined as the reward assigned to the result of NFV placement for service
    flow Υ k u (t)|t= t ~ . SECTION VII. Complexity Analysis In this section, we determine
    the computational complexity of the proposed Algorithm 1. We analyze the algorithm’s
    complexity through two distinct phases: Model Training and Action Selection, which
    occur during the deployment of the trained model. During each iteration of the
    global update period η , the process involves the training of local models by
    the agents (UAVs) and subsequently, the asynchronous aggregation of these local
    models by the MEC server to form the global model. The complexity of the local
    model training conducted by the agents can be expressed as the sum of two components:
    the complexity of action selection and the complexity of the back-propagation
    algorithm for each sample within the replay buffer. This sum is then further multiplied
    by the mini-batch size and η . It is worth noting that the multiplication by the
    mini-batch size accounts for the fact that, in each training iteration, the local
    agent randomly selects a mini-batch of samples from its own local replay buffer.
    The computational complexity of action selection in a fully connected neural network
    with a fixed number of hidden layers and neurons in each hidden layer is directly
    proportional to the sum of the input size and the output size of the neural network
    being used [54], [55]. The input size of the neural network is equivalent to the
    size of the state space, which from (29) is given by 2KF+2(U+1)+K+(U−1)+1 ; and,
    the output size of the neural network is equal to the size of the action space.
    which from (30) is given by KF(U+1) . It’s worth recalling that F= ∑ k∈S F k represents
    the overall count of distinct VNFs required to be executed across all service
    types. Hence, the computational complexity associated with action selection is
    represented by O(KFU) . Conversely, as indicated in equation [54], [55], for a
    specific sample extracted from the replay buffer, the computational complexity
    of the back-propagation process is directly proportional to the product of the
    neural network’s input and output sizes. Consequently, in our specific scenario,
    derived from the preceding computations, the overall algorithmic complexity for
    each agent can be expressed as O(ηO K 2 F 2 U) , where, O denotes the batch size.
    From Algorithm 1, each agent repeats the whole process of local model training
    η times preceding sharing the results with the local server. The last step is
    the aggregation process. While our algorithm conducts asynchronous aggregation,
    it’s important to note that the processing load escalates proportionally with
    the number of UAVs, U . As a result, the overall computational complexity for
    the training phase across the entire network is given by O(ηO F 2 K 2 U 2 ) .
    Based on the prior discussion, the complexity associated with the action selection
    for all U agents during the deployment phase is denoted as O(KF U 2 ) . SECTION
    VIII. Performance Evaluation In this section, the performance of the proposed
    algorithm is evaluated. The performance results are compared for four different
    methods of AFDQN-SGD, AFDQN-Avg, AFDQN with parameter η≠{1, T ˆ } , and a centralized
    case. In the centralized DQN method, all the observations are forwarded to the
    local server and the local server performs the VNF scheduling. Hence, its performance
    can be considered as an upper bound for the proposed AFDQN method. A. Simulation
    Setup The simulation is implemented by Python using OpenAI gym [56], a widely
    used tool for developing RL algorithms, and conducted in a computer with Intel
    Core i7–10700 CPU 2.90 GHz and 64 GB RAM. Using simulation, the impact of parameter
    η , the number of IoT nodes, and the effect of the received load by the agents
    are evaluated. To this purpose, while T ˆ =60 , five different values for the
    parameter of η consisting of 1 (corresponds to AFDQN-SGD), 10, 20, 30, and 60
    (corresponds to AFDQN-Avg) are considered. The other model parameters and simulation
    settings are summarized in Table 3 and Table 4. The proposed system model entirely
    matches none of the existing related works. However, the simulation parameters
    have been chosen to be in line with the typical values commonly used in similar
    studies within this context [6], [32], [33], [36], [37]. TABLE 3 Model Parameters
    and Simulation Settings Part I TABLE 4 Model Parameters and Simulation Settings
    Part II B. Simulation Results In Fig. 5, the convergence behavior of the AFDQN
    method is compared with the centralized method as a baseline. The two extreme
    cases of AFDQN-SGD and AFDQN-Avg are considered. As is evident from this figure,
    for the AFDQN method we have some variations around the value where it converged.
    The absolute value of these variations in AFDQN-Avg is more than AFDQ-SGD, and
    in AFDQN-SGD’s case, they are around the value achieved by the centralized method.
    Also, the AFDQN-Avg converged to a smaller value for total return, we expect this
    result will also be reflected in the performance of AFDQN-Avg against AFDQN-SGD.
    This will be investigated in the following experiments. In Fig. 6(a) and Fig.
    6(b), the minimum achievable average AoI and total energy consumption are investigated.
    The AoI value is averaged over all the agents and the total energy consumption
    is defined as the total energy consumption for sending a single packet of each
    service flow through the network from IoT nodes toward the local server. As can
    be seen, the maximum energy consumption of the three methods is limited to a maximum
    value corresponding to the maximum value of resources that the processing nodes
    can allocate to the requests. As a result, the negative side effect of the methods’
    drop in performance is mostly reflected in the value of the averaged AoI. For
    the AFDQN-Avg, this point is evidenced in Fig. 6(a), where we can see that at
    several points the values of the averaged AoI are more than 1 second. However,
    this is the worst-case choice for selecting the global update period η . Form
    Fig. 6(a), for the proposed AFDQN, we could achieve an average AoI of less than
    200 msec, which is acceptable for most real-time applications. Therefore, performance
    close to the centralized case can be achieved by the proposed method in a distributed
    manner, relying solely on the local observations of the UAVs and the sharing of
    trained local models, thus eliminating the need for exchanging the local observations,
    which can be time and energy-consuming. FIGURE 5. Episodic reward of agent 1 for
    the proposed method compared with centralized architecture. All agents follow
    the same policy, which is a copy of the cooperatively-trained global model. Show
    All FIGURE 6. (a) Average episodic AoI. (b) Average episodic total energy consumption
    of the proposed method compared with centralized architecture. All agents follow
    the same policy, which is a copy of the cooperatively-trained global model. Show
    All In Fig. 7(a) and Fig. 7(b), the network energy efficiency versus service availability
    is drawn. The network-wide energy efficiency is defined as the total number of
    successfully-supported service flows divided by the total energy consumption throughout
    the network to send a single packet from each one of the services flows. Also,
    service availability is defined as the percentage of the service flows that are
    supported successfully. In Fig. 7(a), the average network energy efficiency and
    the sample values in our simulation, as well as the standard deviation of the
    value, for AFDQN- 20 (η=20) are shown. The averaged network efficiency with increasing
    the value of the service availability increases in a way that for the service
    availability of more than 80 percent, it converges to around 82 percent. This
    convergence for large value of service availability shows that we were eventually
    able to provide energy efficiency as one of our objective functions. In Fig. 7(b),
    where the proposed AFDQN method with different values of η∈{20,30,60} is compared
    with the centralized approach, it can be seen that the energy efficiency of the
    centralized approach degrades as the availability reaches 100%. This behavior
    is because the centralized method has a single NN for all UAVs. For the availability
    values near 100%, the centralized agent is not able to do the job as efficiently
    as the AFDQN method where each agent has its own NN. FIGURE 7. Network-wide energy
    efficiency vs. percentage of service availability. The shaded area represents
    the standard deviation (SD) from the average value: (a) For AFDQN with η=20 .
    Sample values are shown for more illustration. (b) For AFDQN with η=20 , η=30
    , AFDQN-Avg and centralized architecture. Show All As illustrated in Table 3,
    the load of services (in terms of requested CPU and storage resources) is modeled
    as a normalized uniform random variable. The standard deviation (SD) of the values
    for both CPU request values and storage is 1.3 percent. In Fig. 8, the impact
    of increasing this value, up to 6 times the primary value of 1.3, on the network’s
    performance is examined. The network is first trained with the primary input-load
    SD value of 1.3, and then, we incrementally raised the SD of the input load. This
    can be implicitly considered as a test under non-stationary load. It is evident
    that in this situation the AoI will increase, as illustrated in Fig. 8. To be
    more specific, we considered a threshold of one second for the acceptable AoI.
    Hence, we have also drawn a graph of AoI violation (in percentage) in conjunction
    with the bar chart of averaged AoI to better reflect the effect of the load SD.
    The results demonstrate that the AFDQN-Avg method has better performance in this
    situation, which appears to contradict our previous observations where we concluded
    that decreasing the global update period improves the performance. This observation
    can be explained using the non-stationary behavior of the input load. In this
    case, the AFDQN-Avg lets the agents learn the variations and input model better,
    in comparison with AFDQN-10, which was chosen as an example for a case between
    two extreme cases, AFDQN-SGD and AFDQN-Avg. FIGURE 8. Averaged-AoI and AoI-violation
    percentage for AFDQN-10 and AFDQN-Avg versus standard deviation (SD) of the load
    normalized by SD of the load in the training phase. Show All The effect of increasing
    the number of IoT nodes per agent (UAV) on AoI and Energy consumption is investigated
    in Fig. 9. For this experiment, two AFDQN-10 and AFDQN-Avg cases are considered.
    The results show that AFDQN-10 had better performance than AFDQ-Avg. Another important
    point that should be mentioned relates to the behavior of the network for a large
    number of IoT nodes, e.g., 120 or more. As the number of IoT nodes increases,
    the load of the agents increases directly, this means that there are more CPU
    and storage requests. Because the resources in the processing nodes are limited,
    there comes a point where an increase in the number of IoT nodes will lead to
    more request rejection responses. In this situation, the fresh packets will drop,
    and that causes an increase in the AoI value. However, the network energy consumption
    does not change because the volume of the active processes does not change and
    remains equal to the maximum capacity of the processing nodes. FIGURE 9. The effect
    of increasing the number of IoT nodes per agent (UAV) on AoI and energy consumption.
    Show All For further exploration, Fig. 10 and Fig. 11 compare the performance
    of the proposed algorithm against two baseline algorithms: Multi-agent DQN (MDQN)
    [57] and the adapted version of heuristic Minimum-Delay algorithm [58]. In MDQN
    the agents operate independently based on locally trained models without coordination.
    The agents are equipped with an identical neural network featuring the same specifications
    as AFDQN. Conversely, the Minimum Delay algorithm selects actions at each VNF
    scheduling round t ´ to minimize end-to-end delay (not AoI) between IoT nodes
    and the local server. FIGURE 10. Averaged-AoI and AoI-violation percentage for
    AFDQN-avg compared with MDQN and Minimum-Delay versus standard deviation (SD)
    of the load normalized by SD of the load in the training phase. Show All FIGURE
    11. The effect of increasing the number of IoT nodes per agent (UAV) on AoI and
    energy consumption for AFDQN-avg compared with MDQN and Minimum-Delay. Show All
    In Fig. 10, a comparison similar to Fig. 8 assesses the impact of increasing load
    standard deviation (SD) on network performance in terms of AoI and AoI violation.
    Generally, an increase in SD raises the average AoI and AoI violation percentage
    for all methods, as larger SD values force agents to find the best action across
    a larger state space. As it is evident, the proposed AFDQN method exhibits the
    smallest average AoI and AoI violation percentage compared to baseline methods.
    However, the Minimum Delay method performs the worst due to its localized short-term
    target. Finally in Fig. 11, the impact of increasing the number of IoT nodes per
    agent (UAV) on the proposed method’s performance in terms of AoI and energy consumption
    is explored and compared with MDQN and Minimum Delay algorithms. Results demonstrate
    the superior performance of the proposed AFDQN method compared to baselines. Additionally,
    as the number of IoT nodes reaches 120 and beyond, there is an increased demand
    for CPU and storage; limited resources in processing nodes eventually lead to
    increased rejection of requests, causing a rise in AoI. However, network energy
    consumption remains unchanged, as the volume of active processes remains equal
    to the maximum capacity of processing nodes. SECTION IX. Conclusion We considered
    the problem of dynamic orchestration of NFV-enabled SFCs in smart agriculture
    applications to jointly minimize the AoI and energy consumption throughout the
    network. Especially, the problem is formulated as a decentralized POMDP. Then,
    adopting the symmetric structure of the network, we analytically proved that the
    optimal policy among the agents is behaving similarly. Accordingly, a novel federated-based
    DQN method was proposed to solve the problem efficiently. The proposed method
    is distributed and energy efficient, as the local agents just need to share the
    parameters of their locally trained model with each other. Although the primary
    goal of this method is to provide privacy among the agents, in our problem, this
    significantly decreased the communication overhead, and additionally, the total
    energy consumption of the network. In terms of freshness of information, the AoI
    is minimized jointly, and the achieved value for the AoI, while the parameter
    setting is set to be close to real values, is appropriate for most real-time applications.
    Appendix In this section, we aim to simplify the problem of determining the optimal
    policy (22) by utilizing some structural specifications of the developed system
    and problem. Inspiring by the work presented by Yongacoglu et al. [48], we introduce
    a class of Symmetric DEC-POMDP based on the Definition and Lemma presented below.
    Definition 3 (Symmetric DEC-POMDP):A DEC-POMDP is called symmetric if the following
    conditions hold: A u = A u ´ and γ u = γ u ´ , ∀u, u ´ ∈U∀u∈U , ∀a∈A , and an
    arbitrary permutation function σ(.) : r u (s,σ(a))= r σ(u) (s,a) , and T(⋅|s,σ(a))=T(⋅|s,a)
    . Lemma 1:Let G be a symmetric DEC-POMDP, for any u, u ´ ∈U , if π u = π u ´ ,
    then, π u is ϵ -best-response to π −u if and only if π u ´ is ϵ -best-response
    to π − u ´ , where ϵ -best-response (for an arbitrary ϵ≥0) defines as a policy
    that achieves (reach) a reward (cost) within ϵ of the maximum (minimum) value.
    In our VNF scheduling problem, as it is depicted in Fig. 3, at each VNF scheduling
    round t ~ , each distributed agent u∈U , has K packet-flow { Υ k u (t)|t= t ~
    } K k=1 belong to different services each of which requires running F k different
    VNFs on their packets. The agents decide on how to place these VNFs into available
    processing nodes, i.e., other U−1 UAVs, the local server, or itself, in a way
    that jointly minimizes the average AoI and energy consumption according to (17).
    All the agents follow the same goal and the priorities among the agents are the
    same. Without loss of generality, we assume that the agents have chosen the same
    discount factor, { γ u } u∈U =γ . Thus, it can be found that the agents conceptually
    have the same model; an intuitive inference that can be figured out better using
    the following Index Mapping rule. Definition 4 (Index Mapping):For each function
    f∈ F k of packet-flow Υ k u (t)|t= t ~ , by definition we assume that the policy
    π u ( t ~ ) outputs I fk u ∈{0,1,…,U−1,M} is the i th candidate processing node,
    I i , as depicted in Fig. 12. The actual selected processing node among p∈{u∪{
    u ´ } u ´ ≠u ∪M} , will be, p u ( t ~ )={ [(u+i)modU] th UAV, M, if  I i ≠ I M
    if  I i = I M , ∀ I fk u = I i . (32) View Source Then, χ fk pu (|t= t ~ )=1 ,
    and X k u , B k pu will be updated accordingly. FIGURE 12. Index mapping mechanism.
    Show All Now, according to Definition 3and Definition 4, the following lemma can
    be driven. Lemma 2:Problem 1is a symmetric DEC-POMDP. Proof:According to Definition
    4, the agents have the same set of actions { A u } u∈U ={ I i } i∈U∪M , so the
    condition (i) of Definition 3 is met. Let define C ℓ as circular shift operand
    with arbitrary value of ℓ , C ℓ (⋅)=[⋅+ℓ]modU . Considering a circular shift of
    ℓ over joint action A , C ℓ (A) , we will have, a C ℓ (u) = a u , thus from (32),
    for each I fk C ℓ (u) = I fk u = I i the selected processing node p C ℓ (u) (t)
    will be, p C ℓ (u) ( t ~ )={ [( C ℓ (u)+i)modU] th UAV, M, if  I i ≠ I M if  I
    i = I M , ∀ I fk C ℓ (u) = I i . View Source Or, p C ℓ (u) ( t ~ )= C ℓ ( p u
    ( t ~ )). (33) View Source Equation (33) means Problem 1 is circularly symmetric.
    To be more specific, we do not have any special dependency on the identity of
    the agents and the state transitions depend only on the profile of joint actions
    performed by all agents. Accordingly, permuting the agents’ actions does not change
    the conditional transition probabilities, T(⋅|s, C ℓ (A))=T(⋅|s,A) , and this
    permutation will lead to a corresponding permutation of rewards, r C ℓ (u) (s,A)=
    r u (s, C ℓ (A)) . Hence, the second condition of Definition 3 is also satisfied
    and the proof is complete. According to Lemma 2, being circularly symmetric means
    that the best agents’ policy, π ∗ are the same, { π u } U−1 u=0 = π ∗ . For such
    a condition, Lemma 1implies that the problem of finding the best policy can be
    reduced to finding π ∗ u , the best response to ∏ u ´ ≠u π u ´ , while π u ´ =
    π u ,∀ u ´ ≠u . Although this result is promising, from an implementation viewpoint,
    proposing a distributed solution for finding the best policy while requiring the
    same policy for all the agents is challenging. Recalling (18), in addition to
    the current hidden state, in DEC-POMDP the agents need to infer the action (the
    policy) of the other agents. The subsequent Corollary establishes a connection
    between this inference and solely relying on the local observations of the agents,
    thereby rendering it feasible. Corollary 2:With the same initialization of the
    belief function, { b u (0) } U−1 u=0 =b(0) , for a circularly symmetric DEC-POMDP,
    the local observation h u ( t ~ ) is a sufficient statistic for determining the
    optimal policy π ∗ . Proof:Assume that using a mechanism, the agents peruse the
    same policy π u ( t ~ ) , while they are learning the optimal policy π ∗ . Then,
    the multi-agent belief state b u, t ~ (s, π −u ) would be, b u, t ~ (s, π −u )=
    = = b u, t ~ ⎛ ⎝ s, ∏ u ´ ≠u π u ⎞ ⎠ P(s( t ~ )=s| h u ( t ~ ), b u (0), π u )
    b π u u (s, t ~ ).∀u∈U (34) View Source So, for each agent u , the local observation
    h u ( t ~ ) and knowing its local policy π u is enough for determining the belief-state
    b π u u (s, t ~ ) . In a DEC-POMDP, the set { b π u u (s, t ~ ) } U−1 u=0 is sufficient
    statistic for the joint history H , and the proof is complete. Authors Figures

    has a huge impact on socio-economic growth, and ensuring its sustainability and
    optimal utilization is vital. This review provides an insight into the role of
    smart farming in enhancing rice productivity. The applications of smart farming
    in rice production including yield estimation, smart irrigation systems, monitoring
    disease and growth, and predicting rice quality and classifications are highlighted.
    The challenges of smart farming in sustainable rice production to enhance the
    understanding of researchers, policymakers, and stakeholders are discussed. Numerous
    efforts have been exerted to combat the issues in rice production in order to
    promote rice sector development. The effective implementation of smart farming
    in rice production has been facilitated by various technical advancements, particularly
    the integration of the Internet of Things and artificial intelligence. The future
    prospects of smart farming in transforming existing rice production practices
    are also elucidated. Through the utilization of smart farming, the rice industry
    can attain sustainable and resilient production systems that could mitigate environmental
    impact and safeguard food security. Thus, the rice industry holds a bright future
    in transforming current rice production practices into a new outlook in rice smart
    farming development. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords
    rice productionsmart farmingfood securityagriculture sustainability Rice (Oryza
    sativa L.) is the primary food source for an estimated 3.5 billion people globally,
    which contributes up to 50% of the daily caloric intake for Asian populations
    (Li et al, 2018). More than half of the world’s population relies on rice as a
    staple diet, making it the second most extensively produced cereal crop (Giri
    et al, 2022). It is also a frontrunner in the struggle against global poverty
    and hunger as well as the primary staple food and a significant source of income
    for worldwide populations. In this regard, rice is crucial to the economy and
    those with lower incomes in promoting agricultural growth and reducing poverty.
    As the proportion of income from agriculture diminishes due to the faster growth
    of other industries, the significance of rice continues to decline economically
    (Adjao and Staatz, 2015). The rice production must be regulated in order to meet
    the demand of the expanding population. As a strategic crop, rice production should
    be increased globally to ensure food security and sustainability. Most countries
    were unprepared for the significant increase in food prices when the food crisis
    of 2007 to 2008 hit, particularly the price of rice (Nodin et al, 2022). Stable
    rice prices in most of the world’s marketplaces have been considered a sign of
    food security. The strategy of rice production for ensuring food security takes
    into consideration of rice marketing, and import and export trends. For several
    developing countries, rice is crucial to food security, socio-cultural practices,
    and government strategic initiatives. The efficient use of resources including
    labour, water, land, and energy along with a lower environmental footprint is
    needed in order to sustain food security and support economic development (Devkota
    et al, 2020). Conventional rice production needs to evolve to make room for additional
    resources, an effective and profitable system for future generations. It is crucial
    to take the sustainability of food systems into account, especially better- utilizing
    rice production in order to feed 10 billion people in 2050 (Saha et al, 2021).
    Typically, developed countries will need to raise rice production, while least
    developed countries will need to maintain their rice production to meet their
    own needs. A sustainable approach to rice production is thus becoming even more
    vital in tandem with the growing population, limitation of fertile land, and insufficient
    natural resources. Achieving self-sufficiency in rice production towards food
    security has significant consequences for a stable supply of rice. The rice dominance
    as a food commodity guarantees the stability in the whole operation of rice production.
    In the early 1990s, self-sufficiency was achieved from the increased per capita
    availability and intensive rice production (Vaghefi et al, 2016). However, since
    then, there have been certain challenges with intensive rice production due to
    the resource shortages for modern agricultural practices. For this reason, advances
    in smart farming in rice production have empowered the supply in accordance with
    the growing population. Smart farming is an agricultural management strategy supported
    by technology that monitors and assesses the requirements of specific areas and
    crops (Alfred et al, 2021). It is known for the use of information and data technology
    for the optimization of sophisticated farming systems. Instead of emphasising
    data storage, access, or applications, it concentrates on how the gathered information
    about rice production may be used intelligently. Utilizing smart farming technologies
    will undoubtedly help farmers with a variety of tasks to boost rice production.
    The ability of smart farming for rice production is one of the key issues at stake
    in the discussion of how to guarantee global food security and sustainability.
    By utilizing natural resources, smart farming adopts the advances of artificial
    intelligence to meet the demands of the expanding population. Smart farming, with
    the integration of various technologies, offers huge potential to create automated
    operations with minimal human intervention. In this sense, mechanization, efficiency,
    and productivity are required at all rice production stages due to the global
    population increase and the limited availability of agricultural lands (Bacco
    et al, 2018). As a result, implementing precision agriculture or smart farming
    is essential for coping methods in the settings of food security and sustainability.
    Therefore, this review addresses the global production and consumption of rice.
    The recent applications of smart farming technologies have been highlighted with
    the technological advancements for sustainable rice production. The underlying
    challenges, trends as well as future prospects of rice production in food security
    and sustainability are also elucidated. Trends of global rice production In the
    past, global rice production has been relatively modest compared with crops such
    as wheat, maize, and soybeans. However, there was a notable expansion in rice
    production during the 1980s, following trade liberalization efforts by several
    rice-producing nations. This trend was further boosted by the implementation of
    the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in 1994 (Abera et al, 2019). During
    the early stages, government intervention held a pivotal position in rice production,
    consumption, and trade due to inadequate food supply, low consumer income, and
    limited foreign exchange earnings (Xie et al, 2014). However, with economic development,
    government policies have shifted towards market liberalization, characterized
    by the establishment of individual production systems, the elimination of consumption
    subsidies, and the abolition of export taxation. This policy evolution has generally
    transitioned from safeguarding consumer benefits to protecting the interests of
    producers. In terms of trade policy, export taxation measures are typically introduced
    when consumer income is low, and the government is committed to ensuring ample
    domestic supplies at affordable and stable prices. The absence of a coherent policy
    for the development and promotion of rice production, primarily due to data limitations,
    will inevitably impact future planning and management strategies for rice production.
    In 1961, only 215 million tonnes of rice were produced worldwide, even though
    rice farming had been ongoing for thousands of years (Ali Chandio et al, 2022).
    The global harvested area of rice was recorded at 1.65 × 108 hm2, whereas global
    rice production obtained 7.76 × 108 t in 2022, respectively (FAOSTAT, 2023). During
    the period from 2016 to 2023, there was a significant increase in global rice
    production and the area of harvested rice (Fig. 1). Enhanced rice productivity
    is probably the main reason for the increase in global rice production and harvested
    area during this period. Global rice demand is expected to be equivalent to an
    annual growth rate of approximately 1%, ranging from 5.03 × 108 to 5.44 × 108
    t by 2030 (FAO, 2014). Although shifting consumption habits have an impact, population
    expansion is primarily driving this demand growth. This outlook emphasizes the
    necessity of increasing rice production to satisfy the growing demand globally.

    Fig. 1. Harvested area (A) and production (B) of rice worldwide from 2016 to 2022
    (FAOSTAT, 2023). Between the 1940s and the late 1960s, the Green Revolution or
    known as the Third Agricultural Revolution led to a rise in agricultural productivity
    among developing countries primarily as a result of technology transfer and innovations
    (Muthayya et al, 2014). The global rice production is projected to keep pace with
    demand and consumption. Accumulation by rice-importing countries, particularly
    China, would maintain relative stability, whereas Thailand would focus on liquidation
    from the government stockpiles (Abera et al, 2019). Current population predictions
    indicate that Asia will require an additional 8 × 106 t of rice annually despite
    the fact that rice production is decreasing (Mohidem et al, 2022). The demand
    for rice has increased along with the preference and taste of customers for rice-based
    cuisines, as a result of the growing Asian communities living in western regions.
    Therefore, to fulfill the rapidly rising demand and discerning consumer needs,
    rice production in the future will need to greatly enhance resource efficiency.
    It is anticipated that rice will continue to play a significant role in human
    diets in the near future. The regional distribution of rice production has remained
    relatively stable over the past decades, with the highest share dominated by Asia
    at 89.7%, followed by Africa at 4.9%, Americas at 4.8%, Europe at 0.5%, and Oceania
    at 0.1%, respectively (FAOSTAT, 2023). Asia’s rapid agricultural revolution has
    driven the regional transformation and rapid economic development (Ali Chandio
    et al, 2022). Americas and Africa both display similar patterns, although the
    changes in rice production have been less dramatic. The significant shifts in
    the regional production share of rice, particularly in Asia, are driven by the
    underlying dynamics of rapid income growth, supported by in-depth economic research
    and historical context. These issues in rice production should be addressed through
    a systematic and holistic approach. Additionally, the anticipated improvement
    in the customers’ standard of living and income level is expected to have an influence
    on rice production. In the near future, it is projected that the global rice trade
    will significantly increase due to the increased consumption of rice in non-Asian
    countries such as several regions of Africa and Europe. By deeply investing in
    and widely applying scientific advancements and technologies, particularly biological
    technologies, in rice production, there will be a substantial increase in both
    the productivity and quality of rice in domestic and overseas markets. Given the
    varying cultural and taste preferences for rice consumption across different regions
    of the world, it is anticipated that the long-term trend of rice consumption will
    continue to rise. However, marketing demands are becoming more intricate due to
    expanding urban societies and a growing middle-class population. This demographic
    shift leads to increasing demand of high-quality rice with diverse nutritional
    values and safety assurances, while the demand of poor-quality rice diminishes.
    The top rice producers worldwide in 2022 were China, India, Bangladesh, Indonesia,
    Vietnam, Thailand, Myanmar, the Philippines, Cambodia, and Pakistan (Table 1).
    China achieved the highest total rice production in 2020, with 2.08 × 108 t, followed
    by India and Bangladesh, with 1.96 × 108 and 5.71 × 107 t, respectively. In several
    countries, such as the United Republic of Tanzania, Madagascar, Peru, Colombia,
    Mali, and Guinea, rice production was on par with some Asian countries, such as
    Laos, Malaysia, Korea, and Sri Lanka. The production quantities of rice are expected
    to rise significantly in the coming years. This is vital as rice production quantities
    are important for maintaining per capita rice consumption worldwide. Asian countries
    will likely continue to dominate rice demand in the future due to factors including
    population expansion, dietary changes, and increased yields from land intensification.
    Given that rice remains the primary staple in leading producing nations, the establishment
    of domestic strategic reserves holds paramount significance for ensuring food
    security. Table 1. Top 30 rice producers worldwide in 2022 (FAOSTAT, 2023). Country/Region

    years, global rice production and consumption have witnessed significant trends
    and patterns, which can be further analyzed by segmenting the data based on the
    type of rice. This segmentation allows for a more detailed understanding of the
    dynamics within each rice category, providing insights into the factors influencing
    production and consumption. Total global rice production has generally increased
    over the past two decades due to population growth, food demand expanding, and
    improvements in agricultural practices. The production growth rate may vary among
    different regions, with some countries experiencing substantial increases in output,
    driven by advancements in technology, irrigation systems, and farming techniques.
    It may also be influenced by factors such as weather conditions, land availability,
    government policies, and market demand. Fragrant rice varieties, including basmati
    and jasmine, have shown a rising demand globally, driven by their unique aroma,
    flavour, and cultural significance. Production of fragrant rice has expanded in
    countries such as India, Pakistan, Thailand, and Vietnam, which are renowned for
    their high-quality aromatic rice. Increasing international trade and export opportunities
    have contributed to the growth of fragrant rice production and consumption. Non-fragrant
    rice, including parboiled and glutinous varieties, remains the dominant type in
    global rice production and consumption. Countries, like China, India, Indonesia,
    and Bangladesh, are major producers and consumers of non-fragrant rice. The production
    of non-fragrant rice has shown steady growth, primarily driven by the increasing
    demand for staple food in densely populated regions. Global rice consumption has
    followed diverse trends over the past two decades, influenced by factors such
    as population growth, urbanization, dietary changes, and economic development.
    In some regions, there has been a shift from traditional rice-based diets to more
    varied food choices, resulting in changes in consumption patterns. The consumption
    of fragrant rice has increased in certain markets, driven by factors like globalization,
    cultural preferences, and rising incomes. Non-fragrant rice remains the mainstay
    of global consumption, particularly in countries with large populations and high
    rice consumption rates. Understanding these production and consumption trends,
    along with the segmentation by rice types, helps policymakers, researchers, and
    businesses make informed decisions related to agricultural policies, trade strategies,
    and market development. It also aids in identifying opportunities for sustainable
    production, addressing food security concerns, and meeting the evolving preferences
    of consumers worldwide. Applications of smart farming in rice Utilizing sustainable
    and smart farming technology is necessary to meet the need for rice production
    with higher yield and quality through mechanization and automation. Smart farming
    is derived from the rise of various applications of industrialization and agricultural
    modernization. Artificial intelligence, Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing,
    big data, and other information technologies are specifically incorporated to
    deeply integrate with rice production applications for smart control and to deliver
    a precise management system, providing crop growth, predictive modelling in visual
    diagnosis, remote control, pest infestation, and disaster warning (Li et al, 2023).
    The fundamental element in smart farming is the extensive use of information,
    knowledge, and technology with the utmost goals including labour-saving, increased
    production scale, maximum yield capacity as well as substitution of manual operation
    and management. Smart farming has various applications in rice production, including
    yield estimation, smart irrigation systems, monitoring disease and growth as well
    as predicting quality and classification. Table 2 shows the applications of smart
    farming technologies for rice production. Table 2. Applications of smart farming

    Rice yield estimation Rice yield estimation is very important due to decision-
    making according to the potential reduction in the crop yield. These innovative
    approaches provide real- time monitoring and data-driven insights, allowing farmers
    to optimize resource management, make informed decisions, and enhance overall
    productivity. The integration of smart farming techniques in rice yield estimation
    holds immense potential for improving crop management strategies, maximizing yields,
    and ensuring sustainable rice production. Accurate estimation of rice yield is
    crucial for effective crop management, food security, and agricultural planning.
    Muthusinghe et al (2019) evaluated rice harvest prediction using two different
    machine learning algorithms. A platform has been designed specifically for the
    smart farming concept in paddy cultivation, incorporating two key modules: a prediction
    module for forecasting paddy harvest and a prediction module for anticipating
    rice demand. The recurrent neural network (RNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM)
    models were used to successfully predict the rice harvest with a training accuracy
    of 78% and testing accuracy of 75%. Elders et al (2022) discussed the application
    of remote sensing in predicting rice yield. In heterogeneous smallholder agricultural
    landscapes, the combination of moderate spatial resolution Sentinel-2 imagery
    and a crop cut calibrated random forest model has proven to be an effective tool
    for predicting crop type and estimating rice yields. Based on the findings, the
    random forest model was developed to predict the rice yield which obtained prediction
    accuracy higher than 80%. In another approach, Xu et al (2020) studied rice panicle
    features by counting the rice panicle yield in the field. The optimal feature
    learning network and the adaptive multi-scale hybrid window were selected by quantifying
    and analysing the correlation between the receptive field, input image size, and
    average panicle dimensions. This approach effectively maximizes the representation
    of panicle features. Additionally, a fusion algorithm is employed to eliminate
    duplicate counting of broken panicles, resulting in an accurate estimation of
    the final panicle count. A multi-scale hybrid window panicle detect model was
    developed to predict the rice panicle counting with an accuracy higher than 87%.
    Hama et al (2020) investigated the rice yield estimation using an unmanned aerial
    vehicle remote sensing integrated with solar radiation datasets. The unmanned
    aerial vehicle remote sensing-derived normalized difference vegetation index is
    employed during the heading stage, as well as solar radiation data from the geostationary
    satellite Himawari-8 and the polar orbiting satellite Aqua/MODIS. The results
    obtained a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.76 and a root mean square error
    (RMSE) of 26.5. By combining these data sources, the study sought to improve the
    precision and reliability of yield estimation for paddy rice crops. Ogunti et
    al (2018) reported various applications of rice yield monitoring systems. A newly
    developed mobile application known as Connected Farm Field App was compared with
    existing applications which could enable farmers to conveniently record detailed
    information about their farming operations using a smartphone or tablet. The findings
    successfully demonstrated the effectiveness of a decision support system using
    mobile applications in order to help farmers monitor rice yield. It is worth mentioning
    that understanding the rice yield estimation is important for monitoring the growth
    of rice. Smart rice irrigation system Water is a vital resource for rice production.
    Nevertheless, its scarcity is becoming a growing concern for farmers. Irrigation,
    a non-natural technique of water delivering for rice production, helps boost crop
    yield (Selvaraj et al, 2022). The efficacy and consistency of the smart irrigation
    system can be monitored through different data-based frameworks by considering
    factors such as soil, climate, temperature, and harvest information. It is crucial
    to use water resources for efficient rice production, as this can open the door
    for an automated irrigation system, which is constantly being developed for efficient
    agriculture. Bamurigire et al (2021) reported the application of an IoT-Markov
    chain process based on expert knowledge and system datasets for fertilization
    and irrigation control systems. Likewise, Pham et al (2021) developed an IoT system
    to improve water efficiency in alternate wetting and drying irrigation. This system
    is feasible, in water saving 13% to 20% more water than manual practice. It consists
    of four elements: a cloud-based management platform, end-user applications, controller/gateway,
    and solar-powered water sensor. González Perea et al (2021) evaluated a pressurized
    irrigation system using different algorithms, including fuzzy logic, artificial
    neural network (ANN), and multi-objective genetic algorithms. The results yielded
    an R2 of 0.70 and an RMSE of 19.9, respectively. Rowshon et al (2019) determined
    the water demand modelling for rice irrigation by generating several hydro-climatic
    parameters. They used a multi-model (ensemble) projection to create a climate-smart
    decision support system for monitoring water resources under different climate
    conditions. Winter et al (2017) developed a water evaluation and planning support
    decision system. They denoted that rice yields appear to follow a step function,
    when there is sufficient water for flooding. Apart from that, Kadiyala et al (2015)
    established a decision support system for water-saving rice production. Their
    findings showed that up to 41% of water can be saved, while still producing 96%
    of rice yield. Xiao et al (2010) studied the moisture content and water height
    of rice field soil. They built a wireless moisture sensor that obtained a water-saving
    irrigation system of up to 65% compared to normal irrigation. Zakzouk et al (2022)
    investigated rice irrigation systems based on different features of the water
    pump, including temperature, humidity, time, and moisture. They compared three
    different machine learning algorithms such as k-nearest neighbour (kNN), decision
    tree, and random forest to assess the classification performance of the system.
    Among all the algorithms, the random forest algorithm obtained the highest classification

    Through the adoption of smart farming practices in rice production, there are
    tremendous prospects for monitoring quality and classification diversity to reduce
    postharvest losses. To improve the precision of prediction and classification
    tasks in practical applications, various imaging techniques can be utilized to
    identify different types of rice. Jin et al (2022) distinguished between rice

    Challenges of rice production in food security and sustainability Rice production
    plays a pivotal role in global food security and socio-economic development, particularly
    in Asian countries where it is a staple food for a significant portion of the
    population. However, ensuring the sustainability of rice production presents several
    challenges that need to be addressed from economic, social, and environmental
    perspectives. From an economic point of view, the profitability of rice farming
    is affected by fluctuating market prices, input costs, and limited access to credit
    and resources for small-scale farmers. Market uncertainties, trade policies, and
    competition from imported rice further compound the economic challenges. Since
    the 1980s, farmers in developed countries had access to new tools and methods
    for rice production. This has led to the development of smart farming systems
    for precisely managing rice production based on various conditions and improving
    the efficiency of input applications. In developing countries, agricultural research
    centres and institutions are currently engaged in improving smart farming applications
    for rice production. However, farmers in underdeveloped countries with limited
    resources cannot afford the technologies and techniques employed in developed
    countries. The majority of rice farmers are underprivileged, yet national policies
    in countries where rice is the main food crop typically favour consumers by regulating
    market prices for rice. Rice production does not provide farmers with a significant
    income due to rising input costs and low rice prices. Food security for rice requires
    a rigorous national policy that permits appropriate investment at every stage
    of rice production. In other words, the correct policies must be created for better
    pricing, marketing, and input availability. Despite slower growth in per capita
    rice consumption in several countries, there is a need to meet the rising demand
    for rice production which is hugely influenced by the population of a country.
    Due to the unpredictability of trade policies of the major rice exporting countries,
    maintaining stability in rice prices is a significant problem in the context of
    shock transmission. From the social perspective, it is crucial to identify several
    obstacles in terms of labour shortages, lack of advanced facilities, and conventional
    rice farming practices. Some farmers stop growing rice because there are other
    economic options available such as job opportunities in the industrial sector.
    Presently, the agricultural sector is experiencing a severe labour shortage due
    to the younger generation obtaining greater education levels and the industrial
    sector offering more enticing and promising career opportunities. Rice production
    is a vital source of income for about 140 million households involved in rice
    cultivation, such as farmers and hired labour (ESG, 2019). Due to this, the labour
    supply for rice farming operations has been reduced. Industrialization, urbanization,
    and the growth of residential areas are reducing the amount of land that can be
    used for rice farming activities. Approximately 79% of the total production cost
    per hectare in conventional rice farming is attributable to labour costs. In this
    sense, the mechanized systems and smart farming technologies are being implemented
    as there is less labour available for rice production activities. From an environmental
    perspective, rice production is associated with significant environmental impacts,
    including water scarcity, water pollution from agrochemical runoff, greenhouse
    gas emissions (particularly methane), loss of biodiversity, and deforestation.
    These environmental challenges call for sustainable farming practices that minimize
    resource use, promote climate resilience, and conserve natural ecosystems. Furthermore,
    the environment has suffered because of the intensification of rice production.
    The use of pesticides may also endanger human health and pollute waterways. Rice
    soil salinity levels in semi-arid and dry regions have increased due to intensive
    irrigation and poor drainage. This has led to nutrient depletion in rice soils
    after excessive pesticide use. Methane emissions derived from flooded rice and
    nitrous oxide emissions from nitrogen fertilizers are often associated with global
    warming. On the contrary, rising ocean water, inconsistent rainfall patterns,
    and rising temperatures could also potentially influence rice production. In tropical
    climate regions, high atmospheric temperatures may reduce rice production, whereas
    variations in rainfall distribution may cause more frequent and severe floods
    and droughts. Rice is a significant contributor to food security with different
    yields according to regional differences in climatic trends. Rising temperatures
    and unpredictable rainfall have a negative impact on rice growth and development.
    A considerable decline in rainfall availability as well as irregular and strong
    rainfall patterns during the past few decades are all related to a significant
    decline in rice production (Habib-ur-Rahman et al, 2022). It will be quite challenging
    to maintain sustainable rice production considering the fact that some underprivileged
    rural populations, particularly in Asia, are facing serious climate change situations.
    The risk of climate change may jeopardize economic productivity and food security
    in the least developed countries. Overcoming these challenges requires a multi-dimensional
    approach that integrates economic incentives, social empowerment, and environmentally
    conscious farming practices. By addressing these challenges holistically, the
    rice industry can foster sustainable and resilient production systems that ensure
    economic viability, social well-being, and environmental conservation for present
    and future generations. Technical advancements and future prospects Global rice
    production has begun to show signs that may not remain constant as the 21st century
    progresses. Despite a slower pace of rice production, there are also fewer resources
    available to grow rice. There are numerous limitations and challenges to diminish
    rural hunger and poverty within rice-based production systems. Fortunately, there
    are technical ways to deal with these challenges as more than half of the world’s
    population depends on rice as their primary food source. The most viable path
    to sustainable rice production is constant productivity growth enabled by yield-enhancing
    smart farming technologies. The increased yields in environmentally sound and
    fertile cultivation areas will lessen the need to use fragile land for rice production,
    which will stop soil erosion and deforestation. In addition to reducing farmers’
    reliance on pesticides, various research projects have been conducted to create
    rice varieties that are resistant to major pests and diseases as well as to control
    natural biological agents. Global industrialization has led to a severe manpower
    shortage in the agricultural sector. It is possible to reduce reliance on labour
    and increase worker productivity by rationalizing land ownership with an emphasis
    on the adoption of innovative smart farming technologies. The majority of rice
    production tasks have been substituted by automated machinery systems and operations.
    The neglect of rice fields has also been associated with lack of resources and
    infrastructure. By establishing a corporation with supply and distribution chains,
    it is possible to improve the situation of farmers in current rice production
    schemes by assisting them in becoming self-sufficient. To preserve rice quality,
    a systematic approach related to rice control and management practices can boost
    the effectiveness of water and fertilizer usage. This will reduce the risk of
    environmental deterioration while increasing farmer profitability and reducing
    poverty. In this case, sustainable rice production is promoted to provide a sufficient
    supply of rice at affordable prices while utilizing environmental, water, and
    energy resources. Sustainable rice production strategies should take into account
    the economic, political, environmental, and social goals of each nation. The top
    priorities for sustainable rice production are international support for workable
    policies and political decision-making from national leaders. In order to achieve
    sustainability in rice production, smart farming technologies incorporated with
    the joint force from private sectors and farmer reorganizations have emerged as
    a new catalyst. Several attempts have been made to modernize rice production through
    the design of policies in order to address the issues related to rice industry.
    For instance, main improvements were rapid infrastructure expansion, enlargement
    of cultivation area through land consolidation, adoption of mechanization, subsidies,
    and the development of rice plantations. The commercialization of rice production
    has been a great success, which has shown to be profitable and attracted potential
    investors. A policy change for export and import in rice production is quite reasonable
    and has obvious implications for the shifting role of rice international markets
    in ensuring food security. It is denoted that the rice international market is
    recognized as an institutional framework for allocating resources for the efficient
    and rapid processing of information. In Malaysia, the national policy is to maintain
    a reasonable level of self-sufficiency of at least 65% because rice is regarded
    as a security commodity (Vaghefi et al, 2016). Income protection of rice farmers
    reduced reliance on external resources, and appropriate rice pricing for consumers
    are the goals of policy initiatives and interventions. In addition, another goal
    for maintaining sustainable rice production is ensuring a stable and fair rice
    supply for customers. To make rice farming economically viable and to promote
    the rice industry, the government offers subsidies by subsidizing fertilizers
    to reduce production costs. The commercial markets are allowed to determine the
    rice price based on the quality grade in order to safeguard the interests of low-income
    consumers. Policy tools targeted at controlling rice trade flows need to be managed
    carefully to avoid negative price volatility that can influence food security
    and nutrition. In the late 1980s, the primary focus of agronomic research was
    the introduction and verification of individual technologies such as herbicides,
    fertilizers, and green manures across three distinct rice growing environments:
    irrigated lowland, mangrove rice, and floating rice (Rodenburg and Saito, 2022).
    Researchers from various disciplines, including agronomists, crop modellers, physiologists,
    geographers, and hydrologists, conducted numerous studies to characterize these
    rice-growing environments, as well as inland valleys. Additionally, efforts were
    made to quantify yield gaps through comprehensive investigations. It is evident
    that policy shocks can significantly contribute to price volatility. This volatility
    can have adverse effects on farming communities, as higher yields and increased
    trade volumes may potentially lead to lower prices (Abera et al, 2019). Such price
    fluctuations can have negative implications for global food security and nutrition,
    particularly considering the substantial population reliant on rice as a major
    staple. Therefore, policy instruments aimed at regulating rice trade flows should
    be carefully managed to prevent detrimental price volatility that could impact
    food security and nutrition. Rice production programs should incorporate nutrition
    objectives to ensure that achieved gains positively influence nutrition and health
    outcomes, recognizing the crucial role that rice plays not only as a significant
    food source but also as a vital component of the livelihoods of many impoverished
    individuals worldwide. The 1980 National Agricultural Policy placed a strong emphasis
    on new land development and the consolidation of economically unviable land holdings
    (Najim et al, 2007). This policy aimed to enhance agricultural productivity while
    ensuring the long-term sustainability of the sector. In line with these policy
    objectives, Malaysia implemented a series of measures to modernize rice farming,
    beginning in the late 1960s. These transformative changes were introduced gradually
    and encompassed various aspects of rice production. The key initiatives include
    improving infrastructure, increasing the size of land parcels through consolidation,
    reorganizing individual land lots to optimize their size and shape, introducing
    mechanization, providing subsidies, and establishing rice estates. The estatization
    of rice farming, which transformed rice cultivation into a commercial enterprise,
    yielded remarkable successes. The profitability of collective farming under this
    model prompted the private sector to also invest in rice estates, further contributing
    to the sector’s growth and development. These policy-driven transformations in
    Malaysia’s rice sector were undertaken to address the challenges faced by the
    industry. By modernizing farming practices and promoting collective farming, the
    government aims to enhance productivity, improve the livelihoods of rice farmers,
    and ensure a sustainable future for the rice sector. The success of these initiatives
    demonstrated the viability and profitability of the commercial approach to rice
    farming, attracting private sector investments, and further fostering the growth
    of the rice industry in Malaysia. As a fundamental strategic item, investing in
    rural infrastructure, especially irrigation and easy access to fertilizers for
    rice production, is important since rice has a significant impact on food security.
    Given the rising demand for rice, much work needs to be done to address potential
    trade-offs for long-term sustainability. Furthermore, successful postharvest handling
    and management that reduces losses and preserves nutritional rice quality should
    be developed. New breeding techniques, such as various forms of biofortification,
    are suggested to develop new rice varieties with improved specific nutrient quality.
    There are interesting breeding techniques that can be used to improve nutrient
    content and reduce illness risks brought on by climatic variabilities, such as
    for golden rice and zinc rice. Wide-ranging rice research and breeding programmes
    are available from various institutions and organizations with the goal of creating
    climate-ready rice varieties that are more resilient to submersion, drought, heat,
    salinity, and biotic stresses. Additionally, research work on rice varieties resistant
    to salinity and drought has been developed to find ways to increase rice yields
    under these circumstances. Through genetic manipulation, genetic diversity can
    be enhanced to improve rice quality and yields. Nevertheless, these breeding methods
    should prevent the loss of other beneficial agronomic traits linked to productivity
    and disease resistance. Efforts have been exerted to effectively utilize rice
    genetic resources for long-term food security and nutrition. Climate change is
    projected to have an impact on the welfare and food security status of rice production
    because of limited land and scarce resources. Increased food insecurity in rice
    production is caused by various factors, including inadequate storage, limited
    rice operation facilities, and unfavourable environmental circumstances such as
    erosion and flooding (Ojo et al, 2022). Despite recent attention to the potentially
    major influence of climate change on rice production, the links between climate
    change and other components of food security have not yet been well investigated.
    For this reason, rice availability and nutritional value are both important factors
    that affect food security. Numerous aspects of food security must be carefully
    studied and action plans must be made in order to create an effective framework
    for sustainable rice production. Therefore, it has been suggested that in order
    to ensure the economic, social, and environmental systems working well, planned
    and proactive rice production strategies should be developed. With the global
    demand for rice on the rise, the need for sustainable rice production has become
    paramount. To address this challenge, integrating advanced technologies and data-driven
    approaches holds significant promise for the future. Precision agriculture, smart
    farming, and IoT system present opportunities to optimize the management of resources,
    refine yield estimation, enhance pest and disease control measures, and minimize
    environmental impacts. Leveraging remote sensing, drones, and satellite imagery
    can provide valuable information for monitoring and effectively managing rice
    fields, enabling more efficient and sustainable agricultural practices. By embracing
    these innovative technologies, the rice industry can strive towards achieving
    higher productivity, improved resource efficiency, and reduced environmental footprints,
    thereby meeting the increasing global demand for rice while ensuring long-term
    sustainability. A significant contribution to the quest for sustainable rice production
    involves the development and adoption of climate-smart rice varieties. These specially
    bred varieties are designed to withstand various climate stresses, including drought,
    heat, and flooding while maintaining high yields and nutritional qualities. Moreover,
    the exploration of genetic engineering and biotechnology opens up new possibilities
    for enhancing desirable traits in rice, such as disease resistance and nutrient
    content. These advancements play a crucial role in promoting sustainable rice
    production. The implications of sustainable rice production extend beyond the
    agricultural realm. By embracing environmentally friendly practices like water-efficient
    irrigation systems and reduced use of agrochemicals, rice farming can actively
    contribute to conserving water resources, preserving soil health, and safeguarding
    biodiversity. Furthermore, sustainable rice production can have positive socio-economic
    impacts, particularly in the lives of small-scale farmers. It empowers women in
    agriculture, promotes inclusive and equitable value chains, and ultimately improves
    the livelihoods of those involved in rice farming. By adopting a holistic approach
    that combines scientific advancements, eco-friendly practices, and social empowerment,
    the pursuit of sustainable rice production paves the way for a more resilient,
    environmentally conscious, and socially inclusive future. Therefore, the path
    towards sustainable rice production hinges on embracing technological progress,
    fostering the development of climate-smart varieties, and adopting eco-friendly
    practices. These strategies hold great potential for boosting productivity, mitigating
    environmental consequences, and fostering socio-economic prosperity. However,
    the realization of these prospects necessitates collaborative endeavours involving
    researchers, policymakers, farmers, and other stakeholders. By uniting our efforts,
    we can establish sustainable rice production systems that safeguard food security,
    preserve the environment, and ensure the enduring socio-economic well-being of
    current and future generations. In recent decades, rice has been the most important
    crop for ensuring food security worldwide. Rice is a strategic agricultural commodity
    in terms of global trade in addition to being a significant staple food. Apart
    from that, rice farming activities have provided job opportunities for millions
    of people across the world. However, numerous challenges need to be addressed
    in the rice industry. Conventional farming techniques and low-quality rice varieties
    are the main bottlenecks, which also have a detrimental impact on global export
    production and trade share. Research and development priorities as well as the
    deployment of smart farming technologies, should time-saving, rapid, and labour-saving
    methods in response to the manual workforce and tedious operations in rice production.
    Authorities, industries, universities, and research institutions should also collaborate
    to accelerate the development of smart farming technologies and their contributions
    to agriculture. The review systematically illustrated that the technological advancements
    for sustainable rice production. It is noted that integrating smart farming approaches
    has a significant positive impact on rice productivity. The applications of smart
    farming in rice production have grown rapidly including rice yield estimation,
    smart rice irrigation systems, monitoring rice disease and growth, and predicting
    rice quality and classifications. To evaluate the potential use of smart farming
    in various operations in rice production, intensive work has been initiated. Various
    studies are being conducted to transfer this technology to the rice industry based
    on the prospective uses of smart farming. More studies are required to develop
    effective and robust algorithms since a large amount of time-series data is needed
    for solving problems in rice production. This review has successfully shown that
    advanced applications in rice production benefit from smart farming. In order
    to reap the maximum benefits of smart farming, this technology can play a major
    role in establishing sustainable rice production as well as providing social and
    environmental benefits. Thus, the technical revolution of smart farming could
    potentially be used in a real-time monitoring system for a variety of applications
    in rice production. Acknowledgement The authors wish to acknowledge the Ministry

  description: The irrigation sector in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) confronts
    a range of obstacles, such as scarce water resources, the elevated salinity and
    alkalinity of irrigation water, inefficient irrigation practices, and inter-sectoral
    competition for water resources. These challenges have led to diminishing agricultural
    yields and abandonment of arable lands. Internet of Things (IoT)-based irrigation
    systems present a promising remedy for these issues. By curbing water wastage
    and ensuring precise water delivery to crops, IoT-based irrigation systems offer
    a viable solution to the challenges entrenched in traditional irrigation methodologies
    in KSA. However, the widespread implementation of an IoT-based Smart Irrigation
    System (I-SIMS) poses a multifaceted and intricate challenge in KSA. This study
    is focused on the identification of the factors and challenges through a systematic
    review and ranking of the challenges/factors that exert a significant influence
    on the adoption of I-SIMS. Ranking aids in determining the importance of various
    alternatives. It enables locating the best options that support the required objectives
    in complex decision situations. The study employs both Grey Relational Analysis
    (GRA) and Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) methodologies to prioritize these
    factors. The study’s conclusive findings indicate that among the challenges, technical
    expertise and security measures emerge as the foremost concerns that demand attention.

  explanation: 'The proposed work is focused on addressing the challenges of adopting
    IoT-based irrigation management systems, particularly in the context of Saudi
    Arabia. The authors have identified eight significant challenges using an extensive
    literature review. These challenges are: Implementation Cost (ICO), Internet Connectivity
    (ITC), Security Measures (SCM), Technical Expertise (TEC), Privacy Concerns (PRC),
    Standard Protocols (STP), Up-to-Date Business Model (UBM), and Mobile Deliverability
    (MOD). The authors emphasize the need to prioritize these challenges in order
    to successfully implement IoT-based smart irrigation systems. They propose using
    a combination of the Grey Relational Analysis (GRA) and Analytical Hierarchical
    Process (AHP) methodologies for this prioritization process. GRA is a multi-criteria
    decision-making method that evaluates the relationship between input and output
    variables, while AHP is a structured technique that involves breaking down a decision
    into a hierarchy of criteria and sub-criteria. The authors believe that this combined
    approach will provide a more comprehensive and robust analysis of the challenges
    and their relative importance in the adoption of IoT-based smart irrigation in
    Saudi Arabia.'

    University, Jazan, Saudi Arabia The irrigation sector in the Kingdom of Saudi
    Arabia (KSA) confronts a range of obstacles, such as scarce water resources, the
    elevated salinity and alkalinity of irrigation water, inefficient irrigation practices,
    and inter-sectoral competition for water resources. These challenges have led
    to diminishing agricultural yields and abandonment of arable lands. Internet of
    Things (IoT)-based irrigation systems present a promising remedy for these issues.
    By curbing water wastage and ensuring precise water delivery to crops, IoT-based
    irrigation systems offer a viable solution to the challenges entrenched in traditional
    irrigation methodologies in KSA. However, the widespread implementation of an
    IoT-based Smart Irrigation System (I-SIMS) poses a multifaceted and intricate
    challenge in KSA. This study is focused on the identification of the factors and
    challenges through a systematic review and ranking of the challenges/factors that
    exert a significant influence on the adoption of I-SIMS. Ranking aids in determining
    the importance of various alternatives. It enables locating the best options that
    support the required objectives in complex decision situations. The study employs
    both Grey Relational Analysis (GRA) and Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP)
    methodologies to prioritize these factors. The study’s conclusive findings indicate
    that among the challenges, technical expertise and security measures emerge as
    the foremost concerns that demand attention. 1 Introduction Saudi Arabia is a
    predominantly arid country with no permanent bodies of water and has the third-highest
    per capita intake of fresh water (Dinar and Donoso, 2020). The widespread agricultural
    programs Reilly et al. (2023) and freshwater have exhausted non-renewable groundwater
    and degraded the quality of water. There is a significant amount of waste in both
    the urban and agricultural sectors. In addition to this, due to limited rainfall,
    major groundwater aquifers in Saudi Arabia have been depleted. Although the total
    amount of freshwater produced in Saudi Arabia increased from 17.5 million cubic
    meters in 2010 to approximately 24 million cubic meters in 2016, the percentages
    of water produced from different sources remained relatively constant, as shown
    in Supplementary Figure 1. KSA figures as one of the most water-scarce countries
    around the globe. With a hot and arid climate, limited rainfall, and a rapidly
    growing population and economy, the limited availability of water resources, the
    demand for water has far exceeded the available resources. One of the major challenges
    that KSA faces is irrigation, due to its limited water resources and inefficient
    irrigation techniques, which is critical for sustainable agriculture and food
    production (Dinar and Donoso, 2020). These challenges have been discussed in several
    recent studies (Ghanim, 2019; Shankar, 2019), highlighting the need for innovative
    solutions to address water scarcity and promote sustainable agriculture. The traditional
    flood irrigation method, which is still widely used in KSA, is highly inefficient
    and wasteful, leading to water loss through evaporation and runoff (Dinar and
    Donoso, 2020). The demand for irrigation water Singh et al. (2023) has increased
    over the years due to population growth (Rambo et al., 2017), expansion of agricultural
    activities, and increasing urbanization. Groundwater reserves, which are the primary
    irrigation water source, are rapidly depleting also due to over-extraction and
    inefficient use (Chowdhury and Al-Zahrani, 2013). The consequences of these challenges
    are evident in the form of reduced crop yields and the abandonment of agricultural
    lands. The salinity and alkalinity of irrigation water further aggravate the situation,
    negatively impacting crop growth and quality, while also contributing to soil
    salinization and degradation. Outdated irrigation practices, including the lack
    of modern technologies like drip irrigation, add to the inefficiency of water
    usage. With the country’s population and economy expanding, the competition for
    water resources among the agricultural, industrial, and domestic sectors is intensifying,
    necessitating a well coordinated method to water management. The government has
    thus implemented various policies aimed at enhancing water resource management,
    such as promoting the utilization of treated wastewater for irrigation (Dinar
    and Donoso, 2020). However, the high upfront cost and lack of technical expertise
    limit the adoption of modern irrigation techniques like drip irrigation. Furthermore,
    the swift urbanization and industrialization in KSA are exacerbating the scarcity
    of water resources, leading to heightened competition among various sectors. To
    address these challenges, efforts have been made to develop a comprehensive water
    transmission system. However, the existing backbone is not up-to-date, even degrading
    in many areas. Furthermore, approximately 20% of the water that is distributed
    is unaccounted for (Dinar and Donoso, 2020). The kingdom of Saudi Arabia faces
    multifaceted challenges in the irrigation sector and requires a comprehensive
    approach that addresses water scarcity, salinity, inefficiency, and competition
    between different sectors. Efforts to promote sustainable agriculture, improve
    water use efficiency, and invest in modern irrigation technologies are crucial
    for ensuring the country’s food security and sustainable water management. Automated
    farming systems utilize various types of data, such as soil moisture content,
    temperature, rainfall, and wind speed profiles within indoor covered agriculture
    farm sheds (Ratnakumari and Koteswari, 2020). This data is collected and stored
    in a computer server to provide insights into climate prediction, soil conditions,
    and disturbance analysis. By utilizing these data archives, farmers can effectively
    monitor and analyze the conditions of their crops, which can improve the overall
    efficiency and productivity of their farming operations. Moreover, IoT-based irrigation
    systems (Shankar, 2019) can also mitigate the impact of water salinity and alkalinity
    on crop growth and quality. These systems can measure and control soil salinity
    levels, thereby ensuring crops receive the appropriate nutrients and minerals
    and also help address the competition for water between different sectors in KSA.
    By optimizing water utilization efficiency in agriculture, these systems can free
    up water resources for other sectors, such as urban and industrial use. Consequently,
    IoT-based irrigation systems offer a promising solution to the challenges faced
    by irrigation in KSA. By optimizing water use efficiency, improving crop yields,
    and reducing soil salinization and degradation, these systems can contribute to
    the long-term sustainability of agriculture in the country. However, identifying
    and ranking the challenges for the adoption of I-SIMS is a complex decision problem.
    When resources like time, money, or manpower are scarce, ranking facilitates efficient
    resource allocation. Ranking helps to maximize the effect of your decisions within
    the limits by concentrating resources on the options that received the highest
    rankings. High-ranked options are often those that fit the goals best and are
    more likely to produce successful results, reducing potential hazards. Despite
    its initial adoption several years ago, KSA has yet to fully adopt an IoT technology
    for efficient irrigation management due to numerous factors. To facilitate this
    adoption, a detailed analysis of the challenges shall be conducted. This includes
    identifying and ranking these challenges to determine which ones are most significant.
    Principal approaches such as GRA (Ju-Long, 1982) and AHP (Ayağ and Özdemir, 2007)
    (Rajesh and Ravi, 2015) can be utilized to determine the priority of these challenges.These
    approaches are both useful resources for making decisions and resolving issues
    in a variety of sectors. These approaches are both useful resources for making
    decisions and resolving issues in a variety of sectors. When dealing with systems
    or issues where data is scarce, ambiguous, or imprecise, GRA is highly useful.
    It works well in situations where incomplete data can prevent traditional quantitative
    analysis from producing reliable conclusions. GRA is excellent at contrasting
    numerous options across various aspects. Even in the absence of appropriate data,
    it aids in the discovery of patterns, trends, and correlations between variables.
    By organizing the decision-making process by dividing complex situations into
    a hierarchy of criteria and sub-criteria, AHP offers a systematic framework for
    decision-making. The advantages of both techniques can be combined to produce
    a more thorough and informed decision-making process with reference to Saudi Arabia.
    The ranking of the alternate factors is significant to achieving the goal of adopting
    I-SIMS by addressing each challenge one by one based on the order of ranking obtained
    using GRA/AHP. The decision problem can be organized using AHP, which can also
    identify the criteria and determine their relative weight. In order to effectively
    handle uncertainty and compare options, GRA can then be used within each criterion.
    This hybrid strategy takes advantage of both GRA’s capacity to handle complicated
    and ambiguous data and AHP’s quantitative prioritization. The goal of using GRA
    and AHP for smart irrigation in Saudi Arabia includes raising agricultural production,
    supporting sustainable agricultural practices, and better managing water resources,
    which shall assure effective water distribution, reduce waste, and encourage water
    conservation. These approaches can aid in selecting the most important challenges
    and enable KSA to move towards a successful and significant implementation of
    an I-SIMS. Smart irrigation systems that are dependent on measurements like evapotranspiration,
    are becoming more popular to enhance efficiency and timeliness compared to conventional
    irrigation methods. There has not been a significant study that addresses the
    KSA decision-problem for smart irrigation. This study will open the door for further,
    in-depth research into this and other KSA-related decision issue domains. Machine
    learning (ML), artificial neural networks (ANNs), and deep learning (DL), like
    the models used in Ghaderzadeh et al. (2022); Habib et al., 2023; Humayun et al.,
    2021; Jabbari et al., 2023; Ju-Long, 1982; Jyoti Deogirikar, 2017; Kabak and Dağdeviren,

    and Koteswari, 2020; Rawal, 2017; Reilly et al., 2023; Saaty, 1989- Sadoughi and
    Ghaderzadeh (2014), are often used to implement state-of-the-art proposals, such
    as machine vision techniques for guessing parameters of importance, such as humidity.
    Moreover, fuzzy logic is commonly mentioned in the literature associated with
    ML, ANNs, and DL, especially when fuzzy logic systems are used in irrigation control.
    In this paper, firstly a discussion of related work is done in Section 2. Then
    an overview of the Challenges in IoT implementation in KSA is done in Section
    3, followed by a detailed proposed methodology in Section 4 as well as the algorithms
    including GRA and AHP, followed by the results. In Section 6, the conclusion is
    provided and suggestions for further work. 2 Related work To address these challenges
    of depleted groundwater reserves, which are the primary source of irrigation water
    in KSA and inefficient irrigation techniques, such as flood irrigation, which
    result in significant water loss, recent literature (Habib et al., 2023) has emphasized
    the need for innovative solutions, such as I-SIMS, to improve water use efficiency
    and promote sustainable agriculture. Several studies have highlighted the potential
    benefits of I-SIMS in KSA. For example, the researchers found that the use of
    an IoT-based irrigation system resulted in a significant reduction in water usage
    and improved crop yields in a pilot study done in KSA (Habib et al., 2023). IoT-based
    irrigation systems can help to overcome the challenges of water scarcity and salinity
    in KSA by optimizing irrigation scheduling and reducing water loss. A comprehensive
    approach was urgently needed to achieve sustainable agriculture in KSA, as proposed
    by (Ghanim, 2019). An array of short- and long-term measures were taken in this
    approach. To begin the integrated solution, the effective management of existing
    non-renewable resources was implemented to safeguard the deep aquifer in delicate
    regions. To achieve this, the use of these resources was restricted solely to
    the provision drinking only and agricultural purposes was prohibited. Additionally,
    implementation of advanced water-saving techniques for irrigation, along with
    the cultivation of low-water requirement crops, and the enhancement of agricultural
    and irrigation practices resulted in significant reductions in agricultural water
    consumption. Increasing irrigation efficiency from 47% to 65% could result in
    saving more than 3 billion m3 per year. The second step in the overall solution
    involved creating new water resources using both traditional and non-traditional
    methods. To increase water availability, the utilization of treated wastewater
    was considered. It was important to note that treated wastewater was an essential
    component for irrigation in critical regions of KSA where the deep ground water
    aquifer was alarmingly low due to excessive use. Additionally, the development
    of rain-fed agriculture and more effective water collection practices were highly
    recommended in the country’s southwestern part, specifically on the deserted terraces
    of the AI Sarawat mountains and along the Red Sea coasts. These areas received
    annual runoff water from nearby and moderately damp mountains, which could be
    harnessed through appropriate infrastructure and management techniques. The authors
    in (Shankar, 2019) designed a smart irrigation system powered by Raspberry Pi
    and utilizing IoT technology. The system automatically controlled the water motor
    and tracked plant growth by utilizing a webcam. By connecting to a WI-FI network,
    the live stream of the farm could be accessed through a mobile phone application.
    The authors in (Quasim, 2021) covered a variety of topics including market size,
    notable IoT players, market predictions, academic considerations, overall architecture,
    opportunities, and challenges. The authors noted that the public’s openness to
    adopting new technologies and the desire for a technologically advanced society
    were positive factors for the successful implementation of IoT-based systems in
    Saudi Arabia. The researchers in (Rawal, 2017) presented a system that involved
    the development of an automated irrigation system that ensured the soil’s desired
    moisture content was maintained through automatic watering. The control unit was
    created using a microcontroller (ATMEGA328P) on the Arduino Uno platform. Sensors
    were used to read moisture levels of soil which in turn was used to extrapolate
    the adequate amount of water necessary for irrigation. Furthermore, IoT technology
    was integrated to keep farmers updated on sprinkler status. The sensor data was
    frequently updated on a web page through a GSM-GPRS SIM900A modem, allowing farmers
    to check whether the water sprinklers are ON/OFF in real time. The authors in
    (Campoverde et al., 2021) presented a suggestion for an irrigation system that
    utilized IoT technology. The system utilized sensors and hardware platforms like
    Raspberry PI and Arduino to facilitate irrigation methods on farms. The water
    pumps used for irrigation were controlled by two crucial factors: soil moisture
    and evapotranspiration. To predict the adequate water levels necessary for the
    plants, RL was used in tandem with an MDP. This method helped in the reduction
    of water and energy needs. The proposed system was analyzed and compared to a
    traditional irrigation system that used a soil moisture threshold to make decisions.
    The experiments conducted demonstrated that the proposed method could save both
    water and energy. The study conducted by (Vallejo-Gómez et al., 2023) provided
    a systematic review using a modified version of the PRISMA 2020 approach to identify
    important aspects related to smart technologies used in irrigation systems. The
    review emphasized, as shown in Supplementary Figure 2, that there was a recent
    increase in research on smart technologies for irrigation system control and modelling.
    The authors suggested that this research area had great potential for further
    contributions. The review also found that embedded systems were generally used
    to implement smart irrigation systems. IoT-based systems are frequently used in
    smart irrigation systems due to their simplification in usage and data exchange
    between devices, which makes data collection and monitoring easier. It is important
    to mention that implementing and adopting an I-SIMS requires identifying and ranking
    of the challenges. Numerous studies have explored the use of AHP, GRA. Notably,
    (Kaya and Kahraman, 2010) employed fuzzy VIKOR and AHP methods for identifying
    the optimal energy source and energy manufacturing locations in Istanbul. The
    authors in (Chang, 2015) utilized MCGP to determine the ideal plant types, locations,
    and other criteria for the expansion of the renewable energy industry. The researchers
    in (Kabak and Dağdeviren, 2014) proposed an approach using BOCR and ANP to evaluate
    Turkey’s energy position and rank renewable energy parameters, taking both tangible
    and intangible challenges into account. The authors in (Zografidou et al., 2016)
    applied a 0-1 weighted GP model to develop the best design for a renewable energy
    production network in Greece, incorporating social, environmental, and economic
    criteria. The authors in (Atmaca and Basar, 2012) focused on evaluating the correctness
    of inplace and future power plants in Turkey. 3 Challenges To analyse and identify
    irrigation difficulties/challenges in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), a defined
    procedure for gathering and analyzing pertinent literature on the subject was
    followed. The question “What difficulties do irrigation techniques in the Kingdom
    of Saudi Arabia face?” provided insights into the factors that affect irrigation
    in KSA. By using relevant keywords and synonyms connected to irrigation, IoT and
    Saudi Arabia, many relevant publications and ideas were highlighted. use of pertinent
    institutional repositories and academic databases (such as PubMed, Web of Science,
    and Scopus) aided in finding most of the studies done in this domain. Reviewing
    the titles and abstracts of the search results also helped narrow down the choices.
    Many irrelevant papers were eliminated. Finally, a quality assessment verified
    the validity and reliability of the studies that were included. 3.1 Resources
    searched The process of selecting appropriate resources for conducting a Systematic
    Literature Review (SLR) is crucial. In our case, we opted to utilize five widely
    recognized digital libraries that primarily catalog publications in the field
    of computer science. These libraries served as our primary sources for identifying
    all relevant literature pertaining to our research inquiries. 1. Scopus: (www.scopus.com),
    2. (IEEE: ieeexplore.ieee.org), 3.MDPI: (www.mdpi.com), 4.Springer: (www.springer.com),
    5. Google Scholar: (scholar.google.com) and 6. Frontiers Library (https://www.frontiersin.org/).
    3.2 Constructing search string The search query was designed based on three fundamental
    concepts: “KSA,” “water,” and “irrigation” as shown in Table 1 Our search string
    is formed by combining different variations of these three keywords using the
    Boolean operators “AND” and “OR”. table 1 Table 1 Search expressions. 3.3 Article
    selection process In Supplementary Figure 3, the comprehensive procedure for searching
    and identifying pertinent publications is illustrated. Initially, we formulated
    a search string that encompassed keywords pertinent to our Systematic Literature
    Review (SLR). Subsequently, we executed the search query in the leading five digital
    libraries that index computer science literature. Supplementary Figure 3 delineates
    the subsequent stages, including the article selection process, culminating in
    the meticulous review of a selected set of 51 articles. Figure 1 defines the exclusion
    and inclusion criteria as follows. figure 1 Figure 1 Prisma Exclusion/Inclusion
    Criteria. Based on the literature and validation from domain experts, the challenges
    that Saudi Arabia may face in the adoption of IoT-based irrigation systems include:
    Implementation cost (ICO): The cost of implementing IoT-based irrigation systems
    is relatively high (Antony et al., 2020), which could be a major challenge for
    farmers, especially small-scale farmers. The cost of sensors, communication equipment,
    and other components of IoT-based irrigation systems can be prohibitive for some
    farmers. Constructing an affordable, widely-supported smart agriculture platform
    to improve small-scale farmers’ irrigation efficiency, save water in a variety
    of crops with different water needs at different stages of growth, and yield excellent
    results Saqib et al. (2020). To increase agricultural field output, precision
    agriculture makes use of computers, sensors, artificial intelligence, and automation.
    It keeps an eye on the environment at the same time to encourage the preservation
    of soil, water, and other natural resources, with a focus on agricultural sustainability
    in particular. However, the accompanying expenses of data monitoring and recording
    technology prevent their broad implementation in agriculture Ferrarezi and Peng
    (2021). The Table 2 below gives approximate cost of a simple automated irrigation
    system Ferrarezi and Peng (2021). table 2 Table 2 Cost of a simple automated irrigation
    system. The cost is about $400 with one sensor and $1000 with 4 sensors which
    is not a feasible expense for a low-budget farmer. Internet connectivity (ITC):
    Another challenge is the lack of infrastructure, such as reliable internet connectivity
    and power supply (Nguyen et al., 2021). These systems require a reliable power
    supply and a stable internet connection to transmit data, which could be a challenge
    in remote areas with poor infrastructure (Nguyen et al., 2022). The research study
    done by Jabbari et al. (2023) encompasses a study on farmers and the use of IoT
    for crop monitoring in Saudi Arabia and the study suggested that the farmers in
    Saudi Arabia are highly engaged and interested in using IoT technologies for crop
    monitoring. According to this study, when it came to agricultural experience,
    36.0% of respondents had none at all. 32.8% of those with experience had been
    farming for one to three years, 19.4% for four to five years, 10.0% for six to
    seven years, and 1.8% for more than seven years. These results show a mix of seasoned
    and inexperienced farmers, providing insights into their respective viewpoints
    on the uptake of IoT technology. 28% of people were single, 53.8% were married,
    20.2% were divorced, and 5.2% were widowed. This variation in marital status offers
    a thorough insight into farmers’ various living circumstances and viewpoints about
    the deployment of IoT technologies. Among the farmers polled, 68.8% of the males
    and 31.2% of the females had used IoT technology, indicating a possible gender
    difference in adoption in Saudi Arabia particularly Jizan as shown in Table 3
    and bar chart in Supplementary Figure 4. The study also clarifies the understanding
    of farmers’ attitudes and behaviours when it comes to using IoT technology for
    activities like crop monitoring, health assessment, growth tracking, and yield
    prediction. table 3 Table 3 Demographics. Security measures (SCM): IoT offers
    a dependable means of exchanging data between a vast array of devices, with the
    crucial requirement that this exchange is safeguarded against tampering and other
    malicious attacks (Jyoti Deogirikar, 2017). Security issues in IoT are a major
    concern because IoT devices are in direct communication on the internet and are
    efficient for collecting, processing, and transmitting sensitive data. This data
    can include personal information, financial data, and sensitive business data,
    among other things. Many IoT devices have weak security mechanisms, making them
    vulnerable to hacking and cyber-attacks. This can lead to data breaches, unauthorized
    access to systems, and other security incidents (ur Rehman et al., 2022). There
    is currently a lack of standardization in IoT security, which makes it difficult
    to implement consistent and effective security measures across different devices
    and systems. IoT devices and systems may rely on third-party services or software,
    which can introduce additional security risks if these services or software are
    not properly secured. It is important to implement strong security measures throughout
    the entire IoT ecosystem, including device design, data collection and storage,
    data transmission, and user access control. This includes implementing robust
    encryption, authentication, and access control mechanisms, regularly updating
    and patching IoT devices and systems, and providing clear and transparent information
    about security practices to users. Technical expertise (TEC): One of the significant
    challenges is limited awareness (Madakam et al., 2015) among farmers about the
    benefits and usage of these systems. Farmers may lack the technical knowledge
    required to implement and maintain IoT-based irrigation systems. Farmers need
    to be educated about the potential advantages of IoT-based irrigation systems,
    such as reduced water consumption, increased crop yield, and decreased labour
    costs. Precision agriculture practices, such as using sensors to monitor soil
    moisture and temperature, are not yet widely adopted in Saudi Arabia, which could
    limit the adoption of IoT-based irrigation systems. Privacy concerns (PRC): IoT-based
    irrigation systems involve the collection and transmission of sensitive data,
    such as crop yields, soil moisture levels, and weather conditions. Therefore,
    there is a risk of data privacy (Deogirikar and Vidhate, 2016; Teli et al., 2020)
    which could be a significant challenge for farmers. IoT devices can be vulnerable
    to cyber-attacks, which can result in data breaches and expose personal and sensitive
    information to unauthorized parties. IoT devices may share data with third-party
    services or other devices in ways that users may not be aware of or consent to,
    potentially leading to the misuse of their data. IoT devices may have weak security
    or encryption mechanisms, making it easier for attackers to access and steal personal
    data. Many IoT devices and services do not provide clear information about how
    data is collected, processed, and used, or give users control over their data.
    IoT devices can be used to track and monitor individuals without their knowledge
    or consent, potentially infringing on their privacy and civil liberties. To address
    these concerns (ur Rehman et al., 2022), it is important to implement strong privacy
    measures throughout the entire IoT ecosystem, including device design, data collection
    and storage, data sharing, and user consent and control. This includes implementing
    robust encryption, authentication, and access control mechanisms, providing clear
    and transparent information about data practices, and giving users meaningful
    choices and control over their data. Standard protocols (STP): The IoT landscape
    is rapidly evolving, with new devices and technologies being developed all the
    time. This means that existing protocols may not be able to keep up with the changing
    needs and requirements of IoT (Palattella et al., 2013). Also, the sheer scale
    and complexity of IoT networks require protocols that can support large numbers
    of devices, handle high volumes of data, and operate in different environments
    and contexts. IoT devices and systems have unique requirements that may not be
    fully addressed by existing protocols. For example, some IoT devices have limited
    processing power or memory and may require lightweight protocols that can operate
    efficiently on these devices. Up-to-date business model (UBM): Business models
    should be up-to-date to run on IoT for several reasons. Firstly, IoT is a rapidly
    evolving technology that requires businesses to constantly adapt and update their
    models to remain competitive. Outdated models may not be able to fully utilize
    the capabilities of IoT, resulting in missed opportunities for optimization and
    cost savings (Chan, 2015). Secondly, IoT introduces new possibilities for data
    collection, analysis, and automation. To take advantage of these opportunities,
    businesses must have models that are designed to incorporate and leverage the
    data and insights provided by IoT devices. IoT also presents new security risks
    and challenges that require businesses to have updated models and strategies to
    effectively mitigate and manage these risks. Failure to keep up with these risks
    could result in costly data breaches or other security incidents. Mobile deliverability
    (MOD): Providing mobile services to users in IoT (Kaushal et al., 2022) is important
    because it enables users to access and interact with IoT devices and services
    from anywhere, at any time. By incorporating mobile capabilities into IoT devices
    and services, businesses can enhance the user experience and improve the accessibility
    and usability of their products. Mobile services enable users to access and interact
    with IoT devices and services from their smartphones or tablets, providing a more
    convenient and accessible user experience. It can provide users with real-time
    notifications and alerts related to their IoT devices and services, enabling them
    to stay informed and take prompt action if needed. Users can remotely control
    and monitor their IoT devices and services from anywhere, providing greater flexibility
    and convenience. Mobile services can provide businesses with valuable data on
    user behaviour, preferences, and usage patterns, enabling them to make data-driven
    decisions and improve their products and services over time. The final list of
    identified eight challenges is given in Table 4. table 4 Table 4 Identified challenges.
    It is imperative to note that the relative significance of these challenges may
    vary depending on the specific context and region within Saudi Arabia. In conclusion,
    the challenges facing irrigation in KSA continue to be significant, but recent
    literature suggests that innovative solutions, such as IoT-based irrigation systems,
    could help to enhance the utilization efficiency and promote sustainable agriculture.
    Efforts to increase the implementation and adoption of these technologies are
    crucial for ensuring the country’s food security and sustainable water management.
    4 Proposed methodology Academics and professionals have investigated several factors
    and challenges involved in the adoption of an I-SIMS in KSA. This investigation
    requires the collection of expert insights, opinions regarding the significance
    of various challenges, and assessments of the relationship between these challenges,
    which are highly subjective and indeterminate. In order to tackle the uncertainty
    and imprecision inherent in this area, various researchers have employed the GRA
    methodology. For example, (Song et al., 2014) applied GRA within QFD to rank technical
    attributes based on customer expectations. Similarly, citepOmoniwa2014 utilized
    GRA to address multi-criteria selection issues in the field of robotics. The authors
    in (Tosun, 2006) optimized drilling process parameters utilizing GRA, while (Sharma
    et al., 2018) applied GRA to minimize food loss by assessing food safety and security
    risks. In another study, (Tsaur et al., 2017) evaluated the operational performance
    of six TFT and LCD products by analyzing both current and predicted future performances
    with GRA. This study has identified eight challenges that influence the adoption
    of an I-SIMS in KSA. However, the information available about these factors is
    uncertain and incomplete, which makes it challenging to construct a reliable model.
    There is a lack of a well-defined strategy for the adoption process of an I-SIMS
    in KSA, which adds to ambiguity in decision-making. Since implementing SIMS is
    a complex and multifaceted task, the correlation between various influencing challenges
    can be blurry. Systems characterized by imprecise and uncertain information are
    commonly referred to as “grey.” Within the realm of MCDM, especially when decision-making
    involves uncertainty, GRA is a highly effective evaluation methodology (Luthra
    et al., 2018). Thus, GRA can be leveraged to establish a dependable model that
    addresses the uncertainty and unpredictability of complex decision-making processes
    by ranking each challenge and predicting its potential impact on the implementation
    of I-SIMS in KSA. Therefore, the GRA methodology is an appropriate tool to rank
    the challenges. AHP is another commonly used technique in MCDM problem domains.
    Developed by mathematician and operations researcher Thomas Saaty (Saaty, 1989)
    in the 1970s, AHP could be established as a structured methodology for analyzing
    complex decisions, particularly those that involve multiple criteria or alternatives.
    AHP entails breaking down a decision problem into a hierarchy of criteria and
    then assessing each criterion in terms of its relative significance to the overall
    decision. This is accomplished through pairwise comparisons made by experts in
    the field, in which each parameter is compared to every other parameter with respect
    to its relative significance. The comparisons are subsequently converted into
    numerical values, which are employed to calculate weighted scores for each criterion.
    In addition, AHP involves evaluating each alternative in terms of how well it
    satisfies each criterion, with pairwise comparisons made between each alternative
    and every other alternative in terms of their performance on each criterion. The
    comparisons are then translated into numerical values, which are used to calculate
    a score for each alternative. The scores for each alternative are combined with
    the weighted scores for each parameter to produce an overall ranking of the factors/alternatives.
    The decision-maker’s pairwise comparisons are evaluated for consistency using
    the Consistency Ratio (CR) and Consistency Index (CI). The CR is the difference
    between the CI and an average CI that was created at random given a set of consistent
    judgments. To assess if pairwise comparisons are sufficiently consistent, the
    CR value is utilized. A CR value of 0.10 or below is typically regarded as satisfactory
    and denotes reasonable consistency. The CI calculates how far the pairwise comparisons
    differ from a set of judgments that are fully consistent. The AHP has been widely
    used in business, engineering, and other fields to support decision-making in
    a variety of contexts, including project management, supplier selection, and product
    design. In this study both GRA and AHP have been used to rank the alternatives.
    4.1 Grey relational analysis Figure 2 illustrates the process of ranking the challenges
    in the implementation of an I-SIMS in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia using GRA. It
    encompasses four main stages: identifying challenges from the literature, collection
    of data using expert opinion, GRA methodology, and ranking of the factors. Step
    1 and Step 2 shown in Figure 2 have already been discussed in the previous section
    in which eight challenges were identified in the current literature. The complete
    algorithm for GRA is given as follows: figure 2 Figure 2 Flowchart grey relational
    analysis. Step 1: Make a decision matrix using expert knowledge. A 6-point scale
    as shown in Table 5, is used in this study to mark the importance of challenges.
    The domain experts are consulted and the data is collected to make the decision
    matrix using Equation 1. table 5 Table 5 6-point scale for decision matrix. Decision
    Matrix (DM)= ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ d 11 d 21 ⋮ d u1 d 12 d 22 ⋮ d u2 …  …  ⋱ …  d 1v d
    2v ⋮ d uv ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ (1) Where dij, 1 ≤ i ≤ u, 1 ≤ j ≤ v represents the significance
    value by an expert (i) for a challenge (j). Step 2: This step involves the normalization
    of the data collected from experts using Equation 2. d '' ij  =  d ij −φ( d ij
    ,1≤i≤u) ϕ( d ij ,1≤i≤u)−φ( d ij ,1≤i≤u) (2) Where φ and ϕ represent functions
    that return the minimum and maximum of given values, dij respectively. Step 3:
    Next the normalized values are used to calculate the reference sequence for all
    challenges in the range [0,1]. This is achieved as given in Equation 3. s ij  =
    |ϕ(d '' ij ,where 1≤ i≤ u) − d '' ij | (3) Where ϕ represents a function that
    returns the maximum of given values, d′ij. Step 4: In this step, the GRC matrix
    is calculated as given in Equation 4 in order to find the correlation to the reference
    sequence calculated in the previous step. λ ij  =  φ( s ij , 1≤i≤u) + ρ ∗ ϕ( s
    ij , 1≤i≤u) s ij  + ρ ∗ ϕ( s ij , 1≤i≤u) (4) Where ρ = 0.5 and is known as the
    Grey Relational Coefficient and φ and ϕ represent functions that return the minimum
    and maximum of given values, sij respectively. Step 5: This step involves the
    calculation of the Degree (D) or Grey Relational Grade Matrix, which is a single-column
    matrix calculated as given in Equation 5. D = 1/n ∑ j=1 n λ ij (5) Finally, the
    challenges are ranked. 4.1.1 Results After an extensive review of the available
    literature, a total of eight challenges (ICO, ITC, SCM, TEC, PRC, STP, UBM, MOD)
    that have a direct impact on the adoption of an I-SIMS in KSA were identified.
    These factors were then validated in consultation with domain experts. The experts
    included eight individuals from both academia and industry, and a scale was prepared
    after discussions with them. Data was collected from the experts using a Likert
    scale (Likert, 1985) ranging from 0 to 5 shown in Table 5, where 0 represents
    no influence and 5 represents very high influence. The ratings provided by the
    experts were used to construct a decision matrix, which is presented in Table
    6 and outlines the influencing challenges to the adoption of an I-SIMS in KSA.
    table 6 Table 6 Decision matrix. The next step encompasses the normalization of
    data obtained in Table 6. It is done using Equation 2. For example, for (PRC,
    #6), the value 0.2500 is obtained as: d '' ij  =  d ij −φ( d ij ,1≤i≤u) ϕ( d ij
    , 1≤i≤u)−φ( d ij ,1≤i≤u) = 2−1 5−1 =0.2500 The results of normalization for all
    d '' ij s is shown in Table 7: table 7 Table 7 Normalization. Next, the Reference
    Sequence Generation (RSG) is done using Equation 3. For example, for (SCM, #3),
    the value 0.500 is obtained as: s ij =∣ϕ(d '' ij , where 1≤ i ≤ u)−d '' ij =1−0.500
    =0.5000 The results of RSG for all sij’s is obtained as shown in Table 8. table
    8 Table 8 Reference sequence generation. Now, the Grey relational coefficient
    calculation (GRC) is generated using Equation 4. For example. For (STP, #6), the
    value, 0.400 is obtained as: λ ij  =  φ( s ij , 1≤i≤u) + ρ ∗ ϕ( s ij , 1≤i≤u)
    s ij  + ρ ∗ ϕ( s ij , 1≤i≤u) =  0 .0000+ (0.5 * 1.0000) 0.7500 + (0.5 * 1.0000)
    =  0.5 1.25 =0.4000 The results of GRC for all λij’s is obtained as shown in Table
    9. table 9 Table 9 Grey relational coefficient calculation. Finally, the degree
    is calculated using Equation 5. For example, for ICO, the degree value is calculated
    using Equation 5 as: D = 1/n ∑ j=1 n λ ij =  1 8 (0.4286 + 1.0000 + 1.0000 + 0.4286
    + 1.0000 + 0.6667 + 1.0000 + 1.0000 = 0.8155 The degree for all alternatives and
    the corresponding rankings are obtained as given in Table 10. In the next section,
    AHP methodology is applied to revise, verify and validate the results obtained
    using GRA. table 10 Table 10 Degree and ranking of challenges/factors. 4.2 Analytical
    hierarchical process AHP is another approach that is used in MCDMs. AHP operates
    by incorporating comparisons and a systematic approach to minimize bias in the
    sequence of decisions (Saaty, 1989). The process involves a 9-point scale. Figure
    3 illustrates the process of ranking the challenges in the implementation of an
    I-SIMS in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia using AHP. It encompasses four main stages:
    identifying challenges from the literature, creation of a pairwise matrix, normalization
    and calculation of priority weights, ranking of the factors and finally confirming
    the consistency of the pairwise matrix. figure 3 Figure 3 Flowchart analytical
    hierarchical process. The complete AHP algorithm is given as under: Step 1: Identifying
    the most significant challenges or factors that have a direct effect on the adoption
    of an I-SIMS in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Step 2: Creation of an n x n pairwise
    comparison matrix where n depicts the number of challenges identified in step
    1. The pairwise comparison is done according to the significance values and using
    Equation 6 shown in Table 11 as: table 11 Table 11 9-point scale for comparison
    values. Comparison Matrix (CM)= ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ 1 c 21 ⋮ c n1 c 12 1 ⋮ c n2 … …
    ⋱ … c 1n c 2n ⋮ 1 ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ (6) Where,  c ij = ⎧ ⎩ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ 1 1 1 −1 3  3 −1
    5  5 −1 7  7 −1 9  9 −1 i is more significant to j i is equally significant as
    j i is less significant to j as defined in Table 11. Step 3: In this step, normalization
    is done by using Equation 7. c '' ij =  c ij  ∑ n i=0 c ij (7) Step 4: In this
    step, the priority/criteria weights and ranking of challenges are calculated using
    Equation 8. w j  =  1  n ∑ j=1 n c '' ij (8) Step 5: Check the consistency of
    the comparison matrix as follows: 1. Calculate weighted sum using Equation 9.
    w s  = CM .  w j (9) 2. Calculate consistency vector using Equation 10. C v  =  w
    s  .  1 w j (10) 3. Calculate consistency index using Equation 11. Consistency
    Index (CI) =  (ξ − n) n − 1 (11) 4. Calculate consistency ratio (CR) using Equation
    12. CI RI (12) Where RI is Random Index given in Table 12 for different values
    of n as follows: table 12 Table 12 Random consistency index. 5. Check if CR <
    0.10, then. The matrix and rankings are consistent, EXIT. Else The comparison
    matrix (CM) should be recalculated. Repeat Step 2. 4.2.1 Results After identifying
    the challenges that impact I-SIMS adoption in KSA, the comparison matrix was generated
    by consulting with domain experts from both industry and academia. Using Table
    11 and Equation 6, the value of significance is inserted for each pair of alternatives,
    and a pairwise comparison matrix is obtained given in Table 13 as follows: table
    13 Table 13 Pairwise comparison matrix. The second step involves the normalization
    of the pairwise comparison matrix values using Equation 7. For example, for (ITC,
    TEC) pair, the value 0.1786 is obtained as: c '' ij =  c ij  ∑ n i=0 c ij =  5.0000
    28.0006 = 0.1786 The results of normalization for all c '' ij .s is obtained as
    shown in Table 14 as shown below: table 14 Table 14 Normalization. Next, the calculation
    of priority weights is done using Equation 8. For example, for STP, the value
    0.1977 is calculated as: w j  =  1  n ∑ j=1 n c '' ij =  1 8 (0.0855 + 0.1293
    + 0.1539 + 0.1786 + 0.2909 + 0.1382 + 0.3871 + 0.2182) = 0.1977 The results of
    priority weights and the corresponding ranks for all wj’s is obtained and shown
    in Table 15. table 15 Table 15 Criteria wights calculation. Now, in order to validate
    the ranking obtained using the pairwise matrix in Table 10, the comparison matrix
    needs to be consistent with the values provided and verified by the domain experts
    because any inconsistency in the values of the pairwise matrix shall mean unreliable
    data which shall point to unreliable ranking. To check consistency, the weighted
    sum is calculated using Equation 9, for example for w5, ws(w5) = ws(0.0825) =
    0.6924. The values for all weighted sums are obtained by the dot product of CM
    with the criteria weights vector, as shown in Table 16. table 16 Table 16 Consistency
    check. Similarly, the consistency vector is obtained by the dot product of weighted
    sum, wswith 1 w j , as shown in Table 16. In the next step, the CI is calculated
    as: CI =  (ξ − n) (n − 1) , where ξ is the average of  C v =  (8.6033 − 8) (8−1)
    = 0.0862 The random index (RI) for the matrix size 8 is given as 1.41 as shown
    in Table 12. Therefore, the CR is obtained as: CR =  CI RI 0.0862 1.41 = 0.0611
    Since CR = 0.0611 is less than 0.10, the comparison matrix is consistent. 5 Discussion
    Both GRA and AHP confirm that the challenges are ranked given in Table 17: table
    17 Table 17 Final ranking. Technical expertise and a skilled workforce (TEC) surfaced
    as the most important challenge in the adoption of an IoT-based irrigation system
    in KSA. There are various reasons that support the obtained result as follows:
    Technical Complexity: Implementing and managing an IoT-based irrigation system
    requires a certain level of technical expertise, including knowledge of sensor
    installation, data collection, data analysis, system configuration, and troubleshooting.
    Farmers and agricultural stakeholders may require specialized skills to operate
    and maintain the IoT devices and systems, which can be a challenge if they lack
    the necessary technical expertise (Catota et al., 2019). Limited Availability
    of Skilled Workforce: In some regions of KSA, there is a limited number of skilled
    workforce, including technicians, engineers, and other professionals with expertise
    in IoT technologies. This can pose challenges in finding qualified personnel to
    design, install, configure, and maintain IoT-based irrigation systems, which may
    result in delays or inefficiencies in the adoption process. Training and Education:
    Providing adequate training and education for farmers and other stakeholders to
    understand and use IoT-based irrigation systems effectively can be challenging.
    The lack of accessible training programs, resources, and educational materials
    for farmers to learn about IoT technology and its application in agriculture can
    be a barrier to adoption. Language and Cultural Barriers: Language and cultural
    barriers can be a challenge in adopting IoT-based irrigation systems in Saudi
    Arabia. The technical documentation, user manuals, and training materials for
    IoT systems may be predominantly available in English or other languages, which
    may pose difficulties for farmers who are not proficient in these languages. Additionally,
    cultural norms and practices related to technology adoption may influence the
    willingness and ability of farmers to adopt and use IoT-based irrigation systems
    (Eysenbach and Jadad, 2001). Upgrading Existing Skills: Adopting IoT-based irrigation
    systems may require farmers and other stakeholders to upgrade their existing technical
    skills and knowledge to adapt to the new technology. This can be a challenge for
    farmers who have been using traditional irrigation methods and may not be familiar
    with IoT concepts, data-driven decision-making, and digital technologies. Cost
    of Hiring Skilled Workforce: Hiring skilled workforce with expertise in IoT technologies
    can be costly, especially for small-scale farmers or those with limited financial
    resources. The cost of hiring or training personnel with the necessary technical
    skills to implement and manage an IoT-based irrigation system can be a challenge,
    making it less financially viable for some farmers. Addressing the challenge of
    technical expertise and skilled workforce in the adoption of IoT-based irrigation
    systems in Saudi Arabia may require providing training and education programs
    tailored to the needs of farmers and stakeholders, promoting the development of
    local talent in IoT technologies, and providing resources and support to upgrade
    existing skills. Collaborations between government, educational institutions,
    and industry stakeholders can play a vital role in addressing this challenge and
    promoting the successful adoption of IoT-based irrigation systems in the agricultural
    sector. Secondly, Security Measures (SCM) are ranked as the second most important
    challenge, which could be attributed to the following reasons: Data Security:
    IoT-based irrigation systems generate and transmit a huge amount of data, including
    sensitive information such as crop data, water usage, and weather conditions.
    Ensuring the security of this data is crucial to protect it from unauthorized
    access, data breaches, or cyber-attacks (Teli and Masoodi, 2023). Breaches in
    data security can result in financial losses, compromise farmers’ privacy, and
    disrupt the normal operation of the irrigation system (Humayun et al., 2021).
    Device Security: IoT devices, including sensors and communication devices used
    in irrigation systems, can be vulnerable to security threats (Masoodi et al.,
    2021). These devices may lack robust security features or may have vulnerabilities
    that could be exploited by malicious actors to gain unauthorized access or control
    over the system. Ensuring the security of these devices is important to prevent
    unauthorized tampering, manipulation, or disruption of the irrigation system.
    Network Security: The communication networks used to transmit data in IoT-based
    irrigation systems, such as wireless (Teli et al., 2022) or cellular networks,
    can be susceptible to security threats. Unauthorized access to the network, interception
    of data, or denial of service attacks can disrupt the communication between devices
    and the central system, affecting the reliability and performance of the irrigation
    system (Abdullah et al., 2019). Physical Security: Protecting the physical infrastructure
    of the IoT-based irrigation system, including sensors, communication devices,
    and control systems, from theft, vandalism, or tampering is crucial. Physical
    security measures, such as securing access points, using tamper-proof devices,
    and implementing surveillance systems, may be necessary to safeguard the system
    from physical security threats. Compliance and Regulations: Adhering to relevant
    regulations and compliance requirements related to data privacy, cybersecurity,
    and other legal aspects can be challenging in the adoption of IoT-based irrigation
    systems. Complying with local regulations, industry standards, and best practices
    for IoT security may require additional resources, expertise, and effort, which
    can pose challenges to adoption. Awareness and Training: Ensuring that farmers
    and agricultural stakeholders know the security risks associated with IoT-based
    irrigation systems and providing them with the necessary training and knowledge
    to mitigate these risks can be challenging. Lack of awareness and understanding
    of security best practices among end-users can result in unintentional security
    lapses or vulnerabilities in the system. Addressing these security challenges
    (Teli et al., 2021) in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia requires implementing robust
    security measures, including encryption, authentication, access control, and regular
    security audits, to protect the data, devices, and networks used in IoT-based
    irrigation systems. Providing education, training, and awareness programs to farmers
    and stakeholders about security best practices and compliance requirements can
    also contribute to the secure adoption and implementation of I-SIMS in the agricultural
    sector. Mobile deliverability (MOD) is an important challenge in which the problem
    of providing services to each stakeholder with mobile and remote devices shall
    be made available 100% of the time. Power Supply and Connectivity: IoT-based irrigation
    systems rely on a stable power supply and connectivity to transmit data from sensors
    to a central system. However, in some remote agricultural areas of Saudi Arabia,
    accessing a stable power supply and reliable internet connectivity may be challenging
    and expensive, which can increase the overall mobile deliverability of services
    and maintain an I-SIMS (Adli et al., 2023). Affordability for Farmers: Farmers
    in Saudi Arabia may face financial constraints in adopting IoTbased irrigation
    systems, especially small-scale and subsistence farmers. The initial setup cost,
    ongoing maintenance, and operational expenses may be beyond the budget of many
    farmers, making it difficult for them to adopt and sustain the technology (Mohammed
    et al., 2021) and inhibiting remote service deliverability. Privacy Concerns (PRC)
    is also a top challenge due to the following reasons: Cultural and Religious Considerations:
    Saudi Arabia has a unique cultural and religious context where privacy is highly
    valued, and strict regulations are in place to protect the privacy of individuals
    and organizations. The Islamic principles of privacy and modesty, as well as the
    social norms and customs, can influence the perception of privacy in the adoption
    of IoT-based irrigation systems. There may be concerns about the potential intrusion
    of privacy, particularly if the systems involve monitoring of private spaces,
    such as farms, fields, or agricultural facilities. Data Privacy and Security Concerns:
    IoT-based irrigation systems rely on data collection and transmission through
    various sensors and devices. This data can include sensitive information such
    as crop yield, soil conditions, weather data, and water usage patterns (Habib
    et al., 2023). Ensuring the privacy and security of this data is critical to prevent
    unauthorized access, data breaches, and misuse of information. There may be concerns
    about the collection, storage, and handling of data by IoT-based irrigation systems,
    particularly if the data is transmitted over the Internet or stored in cloud-based
    systems (Masoodi et al., 2019). Compliance with Data Protection Regulations: Saudi
    Arabia has implemented the Saudi Data and Artificial Intelligence Authority (SDAIA),
    which governs and regulates data and AI-related activities in the country. Compliance
    with data protection regulations, such as the Saudi Data Protection Law (SDPL),
    is important in the adoption of IoT-based irrigation systems. This may require
    additional measures to protect the privacy and security of data collected and
    transmitted by these systems, including obtaining proper consent, ensuring data
    is used for the intended purpose, and providing individuals with control over
    their personal information. Ownership and Control of Data: Farmers and other stakeholders
    may have concerns about who owns the data generated by the IoT devices and systems,
    who has access to the data, and how the data is used. Ensuring that farmers have
    control over their data and that it is used in a manner that aligns with their
    privacy preferences and requirements can be a challenge in the adoption process.
    There may be concerns about data being used for commercial purposes or shared
    with third parties without proper consent, which can raise privacy concerns. Lack
    of Awareness and Understanding: Farmers and other stakeholders may have limited
    awareness and understanding of the privacy risks associated with IoT-based irrigation
    systems. They may not be familiar with the types of data that are collected, how
    the data is transmitted, stored, and used, and the potential privacy implications.
    This lack of awareness and understanding can hinder the adoption of IoT-based
    irrigation systems, as farmers may be hesitant to adopt new technologies without
    a clear understanding of the privacy risks and how they can be mitigated. Cybersecurity
    Risks: IoT devices and systems can be vulnerable to cybersecurity threats, such
    as hacking, malware, and other cyber-attacks. If not properly secured, IoT-based
    irrigation systems can be exposed to potential privacy breaches, leading to data
    leaks or unauthorized access. Ensuring robust cybersecurity measures, including
    encryption, authentication, and access controls, is crucial to protecting the
    privacy of data collected by IoT-based irrigation systems (Lee, 2020). Addressing
    privacy concerns (Teli et al., 2020) in the adoption of IoT-based irrigation systems
    in Saudi Arabia may require implementing strong data privacy and security measures,
    ensuring compliance with relevant regulations, raising awareness and providing
    education on privacy risks, establishing clear ownership and control of data,
    and implementing robust cybersecurity measures to protect against potential privacy
    breaches. Additionally, involving stakeholders in the design and implementation
    of IoT-based irrigation systems, and fostering trust and transparency in data
    handling practices can also help address privacy concerns and promote the successful
    adoption of these technologies in the agricultural sector in Saudi Arabia. Up-to-date
    business model (UBM), Standard protocols (STP), Internet connectivity (ITC) and
    Implementation cost (ICO) appear in the same order of rankings as provided here.
    Business models are already being updated. Protocols are being devised to work
    in line with the new IoT-based technologies. Internet and implementation cost
    appear at the bottom of the list because the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is already
    infrastructure rich and these factors shall pose the least of the challenge in
    the adoption of an IoT-based Smart Irrigation System. Pertinent to mention that
    Implementing an IoT-based irrigation system requires significant upfront investment
    in hardware, sensors, communication devices, and software infrastructure. The
    cost of setting up the necessary infrastructure, installing sensors, and integrating
    them into existing irrigation systems can be expensive, especially for large agricultural
    areas in Saudi Arabia (Ullah et al., 2021). However, most of these costs have
    already been eliminated by having a current state-of-art infrastructure for both
    the internet as well as up-to-date protocols. Implementation costs may be attributed
    to the following reasons: Technology Investment: Sensors, networking infrastructure,
    data storage systems, and other associated technologies must be purchased and
    installed, which entails a substantial upfront cost when implementing IoT-based
    smart agriculture. Cost of Sensors and Devices: Depending on their kind and sophistication,
    Internet of Things (IoT) sensors can range in price. These sensors are essential
    for keeping an eye on crop health, soil conditions, and other factors. Costs of
    Infrastructure: The entire cost of deployment is increased by the construction
    of the data centres and communication networks required to enable IoT. Training
    and Skill Development: More funding for educational initiatives is needed to train
    farmers and other agricultural workers to operate and maintain IoT systems. Internet
    connectivity is a concern due to these issues: Distant and Rural Regions: Agricultural
    regions that are distant or rural may have trouble getting internet access. IoT
    devices’ ability to work in real-time may be hampered by limited access to high-speed
    internet. Dependability Problems: Even in places where internet access is available,
    there might be stability and dependability problems that prevent smart agricultural
    systems from functioning continuously. Broadband Infrastructure: Broadband infrastructure
    quality and availability are critical. This infrastructure has to be expanded
    and improved to provide the smooth communication that Internet of Things applications
    demand. Data transfer Costs: These may be continuous expenses related to data
    transfer, affecting total operating expenses, contingent on the communication
    technology employed (e.g., cellular networks). It is important to mention that
    perceived advantages only account for a portion of the difference in the desire
    to adopt. Access to information and training, as well as farmers’ perceptions
    of government backing, are factors that show a somewhat positive correlation with
    farmers’ propensity to use IoT technology. Taken as a whole, these factors play
    a significant role in explaining the difference in farmers’ adoption willingness.
    Aligning policies in Saudi Arabia with Vision 2030’s objectives, especially those
    concerning technological innovation and economic diversification, can offer a
    strategic framework for the creation and execution of Internet of Things (IoT)-based
    smart agriculture projects. It’s critical to keep up with Saudi Arabia’s particular
    laws and policies since they could change in the future to facilitate the nation’s
    transition to an agricultural economy. The effective execution of Internet of
    Things-based smart agriculture in Saudi Arabia is reliant on all-encompassing
    rules and regulations, including many crucial aspects. First, standards and interoperability
    are handled employing technical standards, which guarantee that IoT systems and
    devices follow consistent guidelines for easy integration. Simultaneously, data
    standards legislation offers criteria for the gathering, archiving, and dissemination
    of agricultural data, promoting cooperation among relevant parties. It is essential
    to have a strong foundation for data security and privacy. Farmers’ data gathered
    by IoT devices is protected by regulations that place a strong emphasis on permission,
    data ownership, and security against illegal access. Policies also specify necessary
    cybersecurity precautions to strengthen IoT systems’ resistance to future cyberattacks.
    In addition, spectrum allocation and connectivity regulations are important because
    they prevent interference and make effective use of available frequencies to provide
    dependable wireless communication. To provide critical internet connectivity for
    Internet of Things applications in agriculture, regulations further encourage
    the construction and upkeep of broadband infrastructure, especially in rural regions.
    Incentives and subsidies also play a significant role in promoting the uptake
    of IoT-based smart agriculture. Financial assistance from government programs
    helps to mitigate the expenses of initial implementation and promotes wider adoption.
    In a similar vein, policies that encourage agricultural technology research and
    development encourage creativity, which produces more sophisticated and affordable
    Internet of Things solutions. Regulations promoting the use of IoT for effective
    resource management, such as precision agriculture and water conservation, address
    environmental sustainability. National plans’ larger sustainability aims are following
    these policies. The policies that promote multi-stakeholder participation help
    to enhance coordination and collaboration. Governmental organizations, businesses,
    and academic institutions work together to create a supporting ecosystem that
    is necessary for the effective adoption of IoT-based smart agriculture. Furthermore,
    regulations about education and workforce development programs guarantee that
    farmers and other stakeholders have the skills required, hence facilitating the
    efficient application and advantages of IoT technology in agriculture. An all-encompassing
    assessment of these variables is necessary to determine if smart IoT-based irrigation
    is technically feasible in Saudi Arabia. Solutions can be more effectively tailored
    to the unique requirements and circumstances of the Kingdom by working with regional
    agriculture specialists, technology suppliers, and governmental organizations.
    Some important factors must be taken into account before smart IoT-based irrigation
    may be implemented in Saudi Arabia. First and foremost, dependable and extensive
    internet connectivity is essential to the functioning of IoT infrastructure, especially
    in distant agricultural areas where real-time smart irrigation systems are in
    place. For devices to communicate with each other seamlessly, effective data interchange
    and system coordination are dependent on a strong network. Second, positioning
    and compatibility of sensor technology are important considerations. The severe
    weather in Saudi Arabia, which includes scorching temperatures and parched terrain,
    must not be tolerated by sensors. Accurate data gathering on soil moisture, temperature,
    and other pertinent elements is ensured by placing sensors optimally. This is
    essential for precision irrigation control. Thirdly, managing and interpreting
    the massive amounts of data produced by IoT devices depends heavily on data management
    and analytics. Making educated judgments about water use and irrigation plans
    requires effective data management. For better scalability and accessibility,
    the viability of using cloud services for data analysis and storage is also taken
    into account. Also, an assessment is conducted on how well-suited the current
    irrigation infrastructure is to receive automated control systems. This entails
    integrating remotely controllable actuators and valves using real-time data. When
    it comes to energy supply, one must evaluate the dependability and accessibility
    of power sources. In areas with plenty of sunlight, solar-powered solutions may
    be a good option. Adherence to regional laws of data privacy and security requirements
    is crucial for the effective operation of intelligent irrigation systems. To determine
    the economic viability, a thorough cost-benefit analysis is carried out, taking
    into account possible long-term water savings, maintenance costs, and initial
    setup costs. The consideration of the availability of trained staff and training
    programs for farmers and stakeholders highlights the particular abilities needed
    to comprehend and utilize IoT-based systems efficiently. Furthermore, the adoption
    of smart agriculture technology in Saudi Arabia may receive extra help from government
    initiatives and support programs, such as those that are in line with Vision 2030
    aims. To customize solutions to the unique requirements and circumstances of the
    Kingdom, a comprehensive assessment of these aspects must be conducted in cooperation
    with regional specialists and stakeholders. 6 Conclusion The research in this
    work focused on the challenges faced by the KSA in irrigation and how IoT-based
    smart irrigation management systems can help overcome these challenges. The paper
    provided an overview of related work and discussed the challenges in IoT implementation
    in KSA. The proposed methodology that includes GRA and AHP algorithms. In this
    study, both GRA and AHP were implemented to rank the alternatives. GRA is an MCDM
    method that is used to analyze the relationship between a set of input and output
    variables and the results. AHP is a structured technique which involves breaking
    down a decision into a hierarchy of criteria and sub-criteria, assigning weights
    to each criterion based on its relative importance, and evaluating factors against
    each parameter. Both methods are used in this study to evaluate the adoption challenges
    of smart irrigation management systems in KSA. According to the final results
    of the study, technical expertise (TEC) and security measures (SCM) top the list
    of most significant challenges that need to be addressed in the adoption of smart
    irrigation management systems in KSA followed by Mobile deliverability (MOD),
    Privacy concerns (PRC), an up-to-date business model (UBM), Standard protocols
    (STP), Internet connectivity (ITC) and finally Implementation cost (ICO). The
    scores for each alternative are combined with the weighted scores for each parameter
    to produce an overall ranking of the alternatives using both the GRA and AHP methods.
    This study shall act as a doorway to more and extended studies in this and other
    domains of decision problems with respect to KSA. Suggestions for future research
    include addressing the potential bias inherent in existing methodologies; a fuzzy
    GRA/AHP approach may be used to analyze and rank challenges in future studies.

    1. Introduction 1.1. Agriculture – food security, gross domestic product, world
    population, and climate change Agriculture plays a crucial role in ensuring food
    security and has a significant impact Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the country.
    With the projected increase the global population, there will be a greater need
    for agricultural production (FAO et al., 2022). The need for food will in-fact
    rise significantly as the world''s population continues to grow. Also, it is expected
    that the world population will surpass 10 billion by 2050. To fulfil the increased
    demand caused by population growth, food production must increase by almost 70
    % (Giller et al., 2021). For agriculture to satisfy this need, it must adapt and
    expand. However, due to additional difficulties brought about by climate change
    and water constraints, existing agricultural methods are no longer enough to supply
    this expanding need (Elijah et al., 2018). 1.2. Smart agriculture – sustainability,
    production, and resources Smart agriculture is rapidly implementing contemporary
    technology to address these issues and boost production and sustainability (Ahmed
    et al., 2018, Lindgren et al., 2018). For instance, a recent scientific field
    called “smart irrigation” employs data-intensive techniques to maximize water
    consumption and boost agricultural production. Farmers may gain useful information
    from sensors and data analytics in agriculture to better understand how their
    actions affect the soil. Farmers may use data gleaned from environmental parameter
    monitoring and analysis to improve practices, make well-informed decisions about
    resource use, and identify crop problems early on. This improves sustainability
    and creates a deeper comprehension of the link between farming and land (Idoje
    et al., 2021, Ojha et al., 2015). Technology in agriculture is essential for resource
    conservation, reducing the environmental effect of farming operations, and feeding
    the world''s population. With the advent of the digital age, sophisticated technologies
    are replacing old farming techniques. These systems provide enormous quantities
    of data that may be used to optimize resources used and boost agricultural output.
    Hence, the use of technology and data-driven decision-making in agriculture will
    boost productivity, decrease waste, and protect the planet''s natural resources
    (Weersink et al., 2018, Khan et al., 2021). Agriculture, not only plays a crucial
    part in providing food security and sustainability, but it also significantly
    contributes to a nation''s economic development (Beckman and Countryman, 2021).
    As was already established, agriculture has a big influence on a country''s GDP.
    1.3. Agriculture, economic, innovative technology, scope, and possible potential
    of the paper In reality, throughout history, agriculture has been a key factor
    in the economic success of numerous nations. In rural regions, especially agriculture,
    not only produces food but also, opens doors to employment. For farmers and those
    who work in the agricultural value chain, such as processors, marketers, and exporters,
    it is a significant source of revenue. As a result, agriculture has the ability
    to promote economic expansion, reduce poverty, and improve living conditions.
    Investments in innovative agriculture technology have the potential to accelerate
    economic growth. Farmers can boost their earnings, produce more food with fewer
    resources, and open new markets for their goods with the aid of modern agricultural
    systems and smart technology (Bathaei and Štreimikienė, 2023, Blakeney, 2022).
    In light of the economic considerations and the imperative to optimize the use
    of this vital resource, the implementation of computerized smart systems in North
    Africa and worldwide has become crucial (Assouli et al., 2018). The proposed paper
    presents an advanced smart irrigation system that aims to revolutionize agricultural
    efficiency and increase yields. With a broad scope that includes innovative irrigation
    technologies and cutting-edge technological applications such as the Internet
    of Things, cloud computing, and embedded system, the paper focuses on improving
    food security. Through potential stability and the promotion of sustainable agricultural
    practices, the study also envisages a future in agriculture contributing to the
    promotion of global food stability. 1.4. Intelligent irrigation – internet, deep
    Learning, Machine Learning, and motivation of this work The intelligent irrigation,
    utilizing state-of-the-art technology like Internet-integrated systems, plays
    a pivotal role in collecting precise data (such as temperature, humidity, and
    soil moisture), this helps in demonstrating its effectiveness in practical applications,
    and facilitating remote control (Rahman et al., 2020, Pramanik et al., 2022, Abba
    et al., 2019, Munir et al., 2021). Consequently, the utilization of the Internet
    in recent years reflects significant advancements in integrated systems, particularly
    in developed nations, leading to remarkable improvements in water conservation
    and production efficiency (Abi Saab et al., 2019, Pasika and Gandla, 2020). Additionally,
    the emergence of cutting-edge technologies such as deep learning, machine learning,
    and artificial intelligence in agriculture contributes further to the maintenance
    and boost of the outcome (Talaviya et al., 2020, Saleem et al., 2021, Subeesh
    and Mehta, 2021). Motivated by global food security concerns, this research focuses
    on irrigation. Meeting the food needs of a growing population while preserving
    water resources is of paramount importance. Current traditional irrigation practices
    affect yields and food security. The study proposes an intelligent irrigation
    system that integrates IoT and cloud technologies. This innovation makes it possible
    to conserve water efficiently, increase yields, and feed crops well. With broad
    global application, this approach advances smart farming, helping to improve food
    security and sustainability. 1.5. Smart irrigation, Internet of Things, ThingSpeak,
    and focus of this work Numerous cutting-edge technologies, including the IoT,
    have broad applications. It is hard for farmers to personally visit and monitor
    every part of the farms they oversee, which might result in inconsistent watering.
    Losses in money and poor crop quality are consequently a result of this. In order
    to solve this problem and streamline the agricultural process, the research papers
    (Ayaz et al., 2019, Habib et al., 2023), suggest an intelligent irrigation system
    that makes use of cutting-edge IoT technology. These studies (Kamienski et al.,
    2019, García et al., 2020), also introduce the concept of “smart agriculture,”
    which makes use of data technology to increase agricultural output and raise the
    overall quality. Furthermore, the mentioned works (Pathak et al., 2019, Ndunagu
    et al., 2022), make use of the ThingSpeak platform, which provides a complete
    solution for gathering and storing data acquired from agricultural sensors and
    controllers, to meet the needs of farm operators. This portal is a useful resource
    for collecting and preserving important agricultural data. Wireless sensor networks
    are utilized by these papers while creating autonomous plants. By using a smart
    irrigation system, irrigation settings may be managed automatically (Tiglao et
    al., 2020, Lloret et al., 2021, Zervopoulos et al., 2020, Morchid et al., 2022,
    Morchid et al., 2021). In these studies (Olisa et al., 2021, Hussen Hajjaj et
    al., 2020, Hanan et al., 2019, Tham et al., 2022), a water level sensor was utilized.
    Specifically, The HC-SR04 device of the real-time water level monitoring system
    is used to accurately measure the water level as a key component. Further, this
    study presented a review of applications of IoT and sensor technology to increase
    food security and agricultural sustainability (Morchid et al., 2024). The focus
    of this study is to provide a smart irrigation system that that would use cloud
    computing and embedded IoT technologies to optimize water utilization and make
    sure plants get the right quantity of water. The research shows how this method
    might increase agricultural yields, decrease water waste, and assist offset the
    problem of food security. The system''s feasibility for application in many places
    around the world is also emphasized in this paper, supporting the progress of
    smart agriculture. 1.6. Main contribution of this work The main contribution of
    this paper is expressed as follows. Fig. 1 also shows the graphical abstract of
    the proposed scheme based on these contributions. • A smart irrigation system
    is proposed using new technologies like the IoT, embedded systems, and cloud computing
    as a groundbreaking strategy to improve food security through the implementation
    of advanced agricultural technology. • The proposed system supervises real-time
    monitoring of crucial environmental factors such as moisture, temperature, humidity,

    ThingSpeak cloud to enable wireless communication between the device and the farm
    owner, enhancing their interaction. • Farmers can access comprehensive farm data
    from anywhere in the world as the sensor data is transmitted in real-time to both
    the ThingSpeak cloud and the ThingView application. This capability allows for

    presents a mathematical-driven function known as linear interpolation to calibrate
    the water level sensor in percentage. This smart irrigation system was created
    using the V model software development approach. • The suggested solution in this
    paper uses 70 % less water for soil irrigation compared to traditional techniques.
    It is more efficient and environmentally friendly since it prevents drowning crops
    and draining water beds. • The proposed article also examines the effects of smart
    irrigation on agricultural sustainability and its impact on food security. Download

    Paper framework of the paper. 2. Architecture of the proposed scheme Smart irrigation
    systems gather information on soil moisture and other parameters using several
    IoT devices and sensors. These sensors can detect the moisture content of the
    soil, temperature, humidity, and even water level. They can also capture images
    of the crops to track their development and general health. Remote control of
    an irrigation system using data obtained from sensors and wireless communication
    with a cloud-based platform for analysis. The data is processed and analyzed on
    a cloud-based platform which makes use of models and algorithms to find the best
    watering plan depending on the information gathered. The irrigation system is
    connected to a small computer called an embedded board which can regulate the
    irrigation system''s water flow depending on instructions. Through a mobile application,
    farmers can access and monitor the system, which gives them real-time information
    on the soil moisture, weather, and irrigation schedule. Through the app, they
    may manually operate the irrigation system or modify the watering schedule. Farmers
    can increase agricultural yields and optimize irrigation thanks to this. As it
    only supplies the crops with the water they require, this technology also conserves
    water resources and lowers expenses. Furthermore, crop planning and research may
    be done using the data gathered by the smart irrigation system. Farmers, for instance,
    might spot trends in crop growth and pinpoint the perfect circumstances for a
    certain crop by examining data collected over time. Future agricultural yield
    optimization and crop planting schedule decisions may both be made using this
    knowledge. In the context of smart irrigation, wireless sensor networks (WSNs)
    enable autonomous plant management through functions such as environmental monitoring,
    nutrient management, disease detection, automated irrigation, and communications.
    Wireless sensor networks provide real-time data on factors such as temperature,
    humidity, soil moisture, water level, and nutrient levels. They support adaptive
    control systems, use low-power nodes for greater energy efficiency, and enable
    remote monitoring and control through cloud integration. Overall, WSNs contribute
    to the creation of autonomous plants by facilitating data-driven decision-making
    and optimizing plant conditions to improve crop productivity and sustainability.
    On the other hand, the integration of various sensors into WSNs is essential for
    plant autonomy. The most common sensors are those measuring temperature, humidity,
    soil moisture, light, nutrients, pests, water levels, and wind. Collectively,
    these sensors help improve plant-related processes. The integration of various
    sensors improves the accuracy and efficiency of autonomous plant management systems,
    enabling informed decisions to be made to improve crop productivity and sustainability.
    2.1. The architecture of the system This section describes the structure of the
    smart irrigation system shown in Fig. 3. The system is made up of three essential
    parts: IoT devices, cloud computing, and application interface. Internet connectivity
    enables consumers from all around the world to view and track their farm data.

    Fig. 3. The smart irrigation system''s IoT architecture. The irrigation system
    is an automated electronic system that is intended to efficiently manage irrigation
    scheduling. Its primary goal is to accommodate the changing needs of plants as
    they develop. Through the analysis of soil moisture content, the system determines
    the precise percentage of water necessary for irrigation, ensuring accurate scheduling
    for various agricultural seasons and crop varieties. The key aims of smart irrigation
    encompass optimizing water consumption to reduce costs, enhancing agricultural
    productivity, benefiting farms, fostering energy efficiency, and ensuring food
    security through utilizing new technologies like the IoT, cloud computing, embedded
    systems, and sensors. The IoT architecture of the proposed system, shown in Fig.
    3, comprises three fundamental components: (1) IoT devices, (2) cloud computing,
    and (3) the application interface. The components of IoT devices include sensors,
    actuators, a control unit, and a gateway, among others. These sensors are in charge
    of monitoring critical environmental factors including air humidity, air temperature,
    soil moisture, and water level within the smart farm. The soil moisture sensor
    is used to measure the soil moisture content. In addition, the DHT22 device, which
    is famous for its accuracy, was used, which is a two-in-one combined sensor to
    measure humidity and temperature. In addition, the HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance
    sensor is used to detect water levels. The ESP32 microcontroller-powered control
    unit receives sensor readings and coordinates the actuators to make sure that
    the plants are watered on schedule. The ESP32 microcontroller is appropriate for
    larger-scale applications since it has adequate memory capacity and improved processing
    capability. The smart irrigation system''s actuators are essential for carrying
    out instructions from the ESP32 controller. In our system, a water sprinkler is
    used to water the plants, and a water pump is used to fill the tank. The next
    development in the IoT device architecture is the addition of a gateway. The gateway
    gathers sensed data from the control unit and carries out critical data processing
    operations to enable intelligent aggregation, optimize network traffic, and lower
    energy consumption. It effectively bundles the essential components of the particular
    process model and sends them to the cloud, leading to appreciable decreases in
    latency and costs at higher levels. The data is continually processed by conventional
    cloud computing systems when it is received from the gateway. Cloud computing
    is the focus of our system architecture''s second component. Farmers now have
    access to a huge variety of data that was gathered through the control unit and
    delivered over the gateway console, thanks to this layer. Farmers may gather,
    view, and analyze real-time data streams by utilizing the cloud-based IoT analytics
    platform ThingSpeak. ThingSpeak is a complete data management platform that enables
    farmers to design unique data visualizations using their own technology. The platform
    allows for the collection, visualization, analysis, and derivation of useful insights
    from live data streams. Using the ThingSpeak platform to post data or the ThingView
    app to retrieve data, farmers may communicate with the system. The irrigation
    system architecture is completed by the application interface, often known as
    the front layer. Results of data processing, such as soil moisture, humidity,
    temperature, and water level, are shown in this user-facing component. Farmers
    may get real-time data visualizations using ThingSpeak and use the knowledge to
    guide their decisions. This interface makes it possible for the farmer and the
    system to communicate seamlessly, which makes it easier to monitor and manage
    the irrigation systems. 2.2. Calibration of the water level In this section, the
    sensor calibration method is employed in the proposed work. The HC SR04 device
    was utilized to measure the water level. Several studies (Olisa et al., 2021,
    Hussen Hajjaj et al., 2020, Hanan et al., 2019, Tham et al., 2022), have employed
    an ultrasonic sensor to determine the water level. However, these papers did not
    provide a mathematical calculation for the calibration procedure of the ultrasonic
    sensor used to measure the water level. In the proposed study, a calibration technique
    is utilized to study the water level sensor. This technique involves a linear
    interpolation function, referred to as the water level sensor calibration, which
    establishes a relationship between the sensor''s values and the corresponding
    water level. (1) expresses this relationship in a linear formula. Specifically,
    when the maximum value of the sensor is represented in centimeters, the minimum
    value corresponds to the %, and vice versa. Fig. 4 visually illustrates this relationship
    between the sensor''s values and the water level in %. Download : Download high-res
    image (183KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Architecture of the
    water level calibration. The calibration process was used to accurately adjust
    the input of the ultrasonic sensor. The sensor is connected to the ESP32 Microcontroller
    for seamless integration and data processing. During the system startup, we obtain
    synchronized sensor data for a duration of 2 sec. Subsequently, we conduct a thorough
    analysis of the system, focusing on the highest and lowest values of the sensor
    readings. The HC-SR04 device is capable of measuring distances ranging from 2
    cm to 400 cm. Equation (1) represents the mathematical interpolation function
    used to detect the water level in percentages, such as 5 %, 30 %, etc. This linear
    interpolation representation of our proposed system is as follows: (1) In the
    given linear interpolation (1), the variables used are defined as follows: Y:
    Output of the water level in %. X: Input of the water level in cm. m: Coefficient.
    P: Zero adjustment. The coefficient may be computed as in equation (2) if we assume
    that the difference between the highest and minimum values is equal to the h2
    described in equation (3). Consequently, level Y is equal to 1 when X is equal
    to the maximum value (Max). Further context or computation can be used to calculate
    the value of P, which represents zero adjustments as flow in equation (4). (2)
    (3) (4) In the proposed paper, it has been determined that the maximum distance
    in the water tank is 25 cm, and the minimum reading is h1 = 5 cm. Therefore, based
    equation (3) the difference between the maximum and minimum values (h2) is calculated
    as h2 = Max - Min = 25 cm − 5 cm = 20 cm. Using this information, the coefficient
    (m) can be calculated as m = -99/h2 = −99/20 = −4.95. (4) is obtained as follows:
    (4) For instance, if X  = Min = h1 = 5 cm, the value of the water level (Y) will
    be 99 %. On the other hand, if X  = Max = 25 cm, the water level value will be
    0 %. The discussion of this study towards the linear interpolation has important
    implications for sustainable agriculture, smart irrigation systems, and food security.
    This representation permits precise detection of water levels at various places
    in a tank or reservoir by creating a link between the values of the water level
    sensor and corresponding percentages. This interpolation may be used by smart
    irrigation systems to optimize water use and enhance agricultural operations.
    Farmers and system controllers can plan irrigation and manage water resources
    more effectively by continually monitoring the water levels. The system can deliver
    the proper quantity of water to crops using this real-time data, preventing over-
    or under-irrigation. This strategy offers two advantages. Firstly, it promotes
    sustainability and ensures that just the appropriate amount of water is delivered,
    therefore conserving water resources. Secondly, the representation helps to preserve
    crop health and production, enhancing food security, by precisely determining
    water levels. According to the mathematical calibration technique presented in
    this article, integrating linear interpolation into the smart irrigation system
    offers significant advantages. The accuracy of the water level sensor is significantly
    increased by this mathematical calibration technique, providing reliable information
    for making informed irrigation decisions. By enabling the system to accurately
    assess soil moisture levels, thereby reducing the risks associated with over-
    or under-watering, the use of linear interpolation improves overall irrigation
    planning. In particular, by reducing water wastage and complying with sustainable
    farming methods, this strategy improves resource efficiency. Linearization also
    improves accuracy. In addition, the approach increases the reliability of data-driven
    decision-making of the smart irrigation system, which in turn fosters stakeholder
    confidence in the accuracy of the system to make well-informed and effective management
    decisions. Linear interpolation effectively optimizes agricultural operations
    by precisely calibrating the sensors, particularly water level sensors, in the
    smart irrigation system presented in this paper. This enhancement enables better
    irrigation scheduling, guaranteeing accurate soil moisture measurements and reducing
    water wastage. The result is greater resource efficiency, in line with sustainable
    practices. What''s more, improved precision has a positive impact on crop productivity,
    promoting plant health and increasing overall agricultural output. This section
    includes a method for calibrating the water level sensor that will provide farmers
    with accurate results. This calibration technique optimizes the possibilities
    of seamless and secure soil irrigation management by facilitating effective process
    control. This strategy differs noticeably from the approaches put forward by authors
    (Olisa et al., 2021, Hussen Hajjaj et al., 2020). 3. Algorithm and V-model of
    the proposed scheme The algorithmic aspect of the proposed approach comprises
    three essential elements. It begins with a visual flowchart illustrating how the
    method works. Next, it explains the process of accessing the ESP32 station and
    establishing a Wi-Fi connection. Finally, it presents the pseudo-code, details
    of the system equipment, and V Model. This combination of algorithmic representation
    and equipment information is a valuable resource for researchers, developers,
    and enthusiasts who want to understand how the system works. 3.1. Flow chart of
    the proposed scheme The smart irrigation system algorithm created particularly
    for smart agriculture is shown in detail in Fig. 5. The algorithm encompasses
    all stages of the software code, beginning with the initialization of the sensors
    and ending with the display of sensors data on both the ThingSpeak platform and
    the ThingView application. Download : Download high-res image (369KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 5. Flow chart of the proposed smart irrigation
    system. The initialization of the temperature, humidity, moisture, and water level
    sensors is the first step in our system''s flow chart in order to get correct
    values from these sensors. The sensor parameters are adjusted as needed after
    initialization to ensure accurate readings. Next, the system checks if the ESP32
    microcontroller, the ESP32 used in the system, is connected to the ThingSpeak
    cloud. If not, the system tries connection with the cloud. Additionally, the sensor
    data is printed on the console for monitoring purposes. For the moisture sensor,
    if the reading falls below 40 %, indicating a low moisture level in the soil,
    the watering pump (W-Pump) is activated, and the green LED indicator is turned
    on. Conversely, if the reading exceeds 40 %, the pump remains switched off. The
    DHT22 sensor, responsible for measuring air temperature and humidity, continuously
    reads the values every 2 s while checking for any potential errors. If the temperature
    reading exceeds 45 °C, indicating a high temperature, the yellow LED is illuminated;
    otherwise, the yellow LED remains off. In the case of the water level sensor,
    if the reading indicates a level below 10 %, indicating a low water level in the
    tank, the tank pump (T-Pump) is activated, and the red LED is turned on. Conversely,
    if the reading is above 10 %, the tank pump remains off, and the red LED remains
    unlit. Every 2 s, the suggested smart irrigation system''s data is updated (2S).
    On the LCD, the sensors'' whole output is shown in real time. The system also
    instantly transmits all sensor data to the ThingSpeak cloud and ThingView app.
    In order to provide accurate and current information on the system''s performance,
    the data is updated every 2 s. Overall, this Smart Irrigation System makes sure
    that plants and crops receive enough water, and it runs well with little assistance
    from humans. In addition, this flow chart makes sure that the sensors are working
    properly, checks their readings, and initiates the required actions in response
    to predetermined thresholds, as shown by the activation of pumps and indicators.
    3.2. Accessing ESP32 station and Wi-Fi connection process 3.2.1. Accessing ESP32
    station The embedded system (ESP32) is typically linked to a wireless router,
    which acts as an access point for the ESP32 to connect to the local network in
    these situations. In most cases, the ESP32 is set up as a station, enabling it
    to connect to the router and access the network. In this setup, we would need
    toc be connected to the same local network as the ESP32 in order to control it.
    This implies that we may operate the ESP32 from any device that is also linked
    to the same network, such as IoT embedded systems (including other ESP32 devices),
    IoT gateways (which may include routers), and IoT terminals like PCs or smartphones
    as illustrated in Fig. 6. Our system can access and manage the ESP32 from anywhere
    in the range of that network as long as these devices are linked to it. Download

    the design process for creating a Wi-Fi connection adheres to. The ESP32 microcontroller
    is initially initialized to guarantee good operation. The system then confirms
    that the microcontroller is effectively linked to a Wi-Fi network. The information
    is swiftly and in real-time delivered to the ThingSpeak cloud platform after the
    connection has been verified. As shown in Fig. 7, this guarantees that all sensor-generated
    data is easily accessed and shown on the ThingSpeak platform and the associated
    ThingView application. Download : Download high-res image (198KB) Download : Download

    and equipment of the system In order to program, develop, and visualize the algorithm''s
    structure, the pseudo-code is supplied below. The algorithm for the suggested
    irrigation system is shown in Table 1. This pseudo-code defines the simulation
    of intelligent irrigation based on an embedded system that monitors environmental
    conditions, controls pumps, and communicates with the cloud (The ThingSpeak platform
    and the ThingView application). It starts by defining constants for the different
    thresholds in lines 1–2. The program uses variables to represent sensor readings,
    pump states, and connection status in lines 3–11. Initialise built-in devices
    such as ESP32 and sensors in lines 12–13. Table 1. Algorithm 1. Pseudo-code of

    system on lines 14–40. Within the loop: Sensor values (temperature, humidity,
    moisture, water level) are (1) simulated, although actual sensor data is used
    in practice. (2) The humidity sensor reading is calibrated on a percentage scale.
    (3) The water level is calculated by linear interpolation. (4) The simulated data
    is sent to the cloud platforms (ThingSpeak and ThingView) for visualization and
    analysis. (5) The state of the connection to the cloud is simulated. (6) Control
    logic evaluates humidity and water levels to determine pump conditions. (7) Pump
    control flags (TonWP, ToffWP, TonTP, ToffTP) are set based on the control logic
    conditions. (8) A simulation delay has been introduced between iterations. The
    code uses placeholder functions to read sensors, set values, and check connectivity
    to the cloud. These functions need to be implemented to interact with real devices
    and services. In general, this pseudo-code demonstrates the logic of the system
    that collects sensor data, communicates with the cloud (ThingSpeak and ThingView),
    and controls pumps according to predefined thresholds. Table 2 briefly gives the
    hardware components used in this design, and explains the particular uses for
    which it was used. It includes the controllers, sensors, pumps, and other devices
    used in this system. Table 2. The equipment of the system. Sr. no Hardware Functions
    1. ESP32 Microcontroller The ESP32 is a flexible microcontroller with a variety
    of features and capabilities. It may be used in combination with a host MCU as
    a secondary device or as an independent system. Reduced communication stack overhead
    on the main application processor is one of its main benefits. The ESP32 can also
    communicate with other systems, allowing the inclusion of Bluetooth and Wi-Fi
    features via SPI/SDIO or I2C/UART interfaces. Because of its adaptability, the
    ESP32 is a potent tool for several applications. 2. DHT22 (AM2302) It is a two-in-one
    combination sensor for measuring ambient air humidity and temperature, all with
    high accuracy. 3. Soil Moisture Sensor A device used to detect moisture or water
    content in the soil. Farmers and gardeners use the information to make informed
    decisions about watering and watering schedules by gaining vital insight into
    soil moisture content. 4. HC-SR04 – Ultrasonic Distance Sensor The device is used
    to measure and monitor the water level within a tank, giving vital data for effective
    water management. 5. Tank Pump The tank pump was employed to recharge the tank
    when it became empty. This device contributes to the system''s continued operating
    effectiveness and offers a dependable water source for irrigation needs. 6. Watering
    Pump The watering pump is responsible for irrigating the soil by delivering water
    to the plants 7. Relay_1 A relay was utilized to activate the tank pump for tank
    refilling when it becomes empty. 8. Relay_2 A relay was used to control the watering
    pump responsible for soil irrigation. 9. Power Supply Powering all of the system''s
    components with electrical energy is the power source''s main duty. This power
    source acts as the system''s main energy source, supplying each component with
    the energy it needs to operate properly, including the sensors, actuators, controllers,
    and communication modules. By providing dependable power, the system can function
    without interruption, making it possible to complete activities like data gathering,
    processing, and communication successfully. 3.4. V Model of the smart irrigation
    system A crucial element of our approach is the integration of sensor and control
    system data into the V model, which guides the development of the best irrigation
    program. Within the framework of the V model, which is a software development
    methodology, we have created an intelligent irrigation system exploiting the IoT
    and an integrated board such as the ESP32. This board transmits data to the cloud,
    including platforms such as ThingSpeak, and enables remote monitoring via the
    ThingView application. As shown in Fig. 8 the exact ways to apply the V model,
    in this case, are as follows: (1) Requirements Gathering and Analysis: The requirements
    for the system are gathered and examined at this stage of the V Model. This involves
    identifying the system''s users, such as farmers and agricultural engineers, their
    requirements and goals (such as automating irrigation based on weather and soil
    conditions and sending data to the cloud for remote monitoring and analysis),
    as well as any limitations that must be taken into account (such as cost, and
    compatibility with existing equipment). (2) System Design: The system architecture
    and general design are developed at this stage. This entails a choice of sensors
    to track soil moisture, temperature, and water level, an embedded board such as
    ESP32 to collect and process sensor data, and a wireless communication module
    such as Wi-Fi to transmit sensor data to a remote server or a cloud-based platform
    such as ThingSpeak. Designing the control system that will be used to create the
    ideal irrigation schedule is also part of this phase. (3) Implementation: The
    integration of sensor and control system data into the Model V is a crucial step
    in the implementation of our intelligent irrigation system. At this stage, the
    system is activated, the control system is configured and the integrated board,
    such as the ESP32, is programmed. A connection to the cloud is established, enabling
    the irrigation system to be monitored and operated remotely. It''s important to
    note that this phase also includes the integration of sensor data into the control
    system, enabling the best irrigation program to be determined. The code practice
    for sending sensor data to the ThingSpeak cloud platform is also implemented during
    this stage. This seamless integration of components guarantees optimum system
    efficiency, enabling precise, responsive management of the irrigation program
    according to environmental conditions and specific crop needs. (4) Verification:
    To make sure the system satisfies the criteria established in step one, this stage
    entails testing it. Functional testing, performance testing, and integration testing
    are all part of this. The communication between the embedded board and the ThingSpeak
    cloud platform as well as the communication between the embedded board and the
    remote server or cloud-based platform are both tested at this stage. (5) Maintenance:
    The deployment of the system and any required upkeep and upgrades are done in
    this final phase of the V Model. This stage also entails keeping an eye on the
    system''s operation and making any required modifications. Additionally, it entails
    testing the connectivity, upgrading the firmware, and making sure that new software
    versions are compatible. This stage also entails keeping an eye on the information
    transmitted to ThingSpeak and resolving any transmission problems. Download :

    4. Results and discussion In this section, we provide a detailed analysis of the
    proposed Smart Irrigation System, including its results and efficiency compared
    to existing scientific papers. We also look at how the system affects agricultural
    sustainability and how it helps provide food security. The innovation of this
    study lies in its integration of cutting-edge technology like embedded system
    cloud computing and the IoT. The system makes it possible to monitor and manage
    irrigation operations in real-time by leveraging IoT devices, sensors, and actuators.
    Utilizing cloud computing enables data storage, analysis, and decision-making,
    which results in enhanced irrigation control and optimum water utilization. This
    novel strategy transforms conventional approaches by improving irrigation operations''
    accuracy, efficacy, and sustainability. Efficiently sent to ThingSpeak platforms
    and the ThingView app, data from simulated sensors represent environmental parameters
    such as temperature and humidity. Data is provided securely regularly, simulating
    sensor updates in real-time, using the MQTT protocol for communication. Cloud
    platforms can be configured to accurately visualize data using graphs and charts,
    enabling real-time monitoring and analysis, just like with field data. 4.1. Experimental
    results The experimental results of the proposed irrigation system are presented
    in Table 3. The table provides continuous measurements of various parameters including
    soil moisture, temperature, and humidity, as well as outputs from the water level
    sensor in centimeters and the water level in percentages. These measurements were
    recorded over a period of seven days. Additionally, Table 3 includes information
    on the status of data transmission to the platform and app, indicating whether
    the data was successfully sent, and the response time of 2 s. It should be noted
    that the weather conditions during the data collection period were normal, with
    no rainfall. These comprehensive measurements provide valuable insights into the
    performance of the smart system, showcasing the variations in soil moisture, temperature,
    humidity, and water level over the seven-day period. Such data is critical for
    optimizing irrigation strategies and ensuring efficient water management in agricultural
    practices. Cloud computing, in particular the integration of the MathWorks laboratory
    into the ThingSpeak platform of our intelligent irrigation system, improves data
    storage, analysis, and irrigation control decision-making through scalable storage,
    remote access to all data, and real-time analytics on ThingSpeak. This contributes
    to cost-effectiveness, improved security, collaborative management, reliability,
    efficient data processing, collaborative decision-making, and good results. Table

    the studies (Ndunagu et al., 2022, Tiglao et al., 2020). Moisture sensor data
    were taken during the first 2 s of the system loop, indicating the lowest and
    maximum predicted values of the readings. The function moisture = map (moisture,
    4095, 2413, 0, 100) was used to do a two-point calibration on the moisture sensor''s
    natural outputs. The function mapping approach is used in the demonstration section
    to calibrate the humidity sensor. A few configurations must be made before the
    ESP32 Microcontroller can be started. The moisture sensor''s minimum and maximum
    readings are defined specifically. Values for the moisture sensor vary from a
    minimum of 4095 to a high of 2413. A function is used to transform the sensor
    value from 0 % to 100 %, with 100 % indicating the maximum value, in order to
    make the reading procedure easier for consumers. The user-friendly interpretation
    of the sensor readings is ensured by this change. Two-point calibration is of
    significant importance in the calibration process of the moisture sensor of our
    intelligent irrigation system. This method involves calibrating the sensor to
    two different moisture levels, typically representing the extremes of the moisture
    spectrum. The importance of using a two-point calibration method lies in its ability
    to improve accuracy, account for variability in soil conditions, account for dynamic
    moisture ranges and allow customization for specific agricultural applications.
    This meticulous calibration approach is fundamental to ensuring the efficiency
    of the smart irrigation system in optimizing water. 4.2. Results on the platform
    in real-time The ThingSpeak cloud receives data obtained by our system. So we
    can use our mobile app or our PC to obtain or download it for free using the platform
    ThingSpeak or the app ThingView. Fig. 9 shows some farm temperature readings displayed
    on the ThingSpeak. The farm owner can now connect to the cloud and see the graphical
    output to check the status of the farm. The maximum value of the temperature read
    is 25.5 °C, and the minimum value is 24.9 °C. On the ThingSpeak platform, Fig.
    10 displays some on-farm air humidity data. The maximum value of the humidity
    read is 35.00 % and the minimum value is 39.4 %. The farm owner may now connect
    to the cloud and examine the farm''s status using the graphical output. Download

    farm is shown in Fig. 11 on ThingSpeak. It shows that the soil was initially dry.
    When the water pump was turned on, the moisture sensor registered around 80 %.
    The range of soil moisture measured ranged from 0 % to 82 %. On the other hand,
    Fig. 12 illustrates how the water level was around 80 % when the irrigation water
    pump was switched on, which caused the water storage to be depleted. The data
    from the moisture sensors combined with the observations of the water level sheds
    light on the dynamic interaction between soil moisture levels, water pump performance,
    and water storage management and offers useful insights into the irrigation process.
    These findings support wise agricultural practices by enabling informed decision-making
    and effective water resource management. Download : Download high-res image (89KB)

    real-time. Every 2 s, the ESP32 microcontroller sends data on the temperature,
    humidity, soil moisture, and water level to the ThingSpeak IoT analytics platform.
    The farmer may easily access this information via the ThingSpeak channel, giving
    them a simple and precise way to keep an eye on their field. Additionally, the
    data may be exported to an Excel document using the ThingSpeak channel''s “export
    recent data” function, enabling additional analysis and investigation. Additionally,
    an application called ThingView, which is available for free download from the
    Google Play Store, makes it simple to retrieve the data from ThingSpeak on mobile
    devices. The farm owner may remotely access all the data with this smartphone
    application, making it simple and convenient to manage the irrigation system.
    The use of this smart irrigation system is essential because it guarantees precise
    and timely irrigation of agricultural plants, creating the ideal environment for
    plant growth. The field or farm owner''s overall farming experience is considerably
    improved by this method. Further, implementing our smart irrigation system requires
    a high level of technical expertise. The system is designed and implemented by
    specialists before being delivered to farmers. Farmers, meanwhile, benefit from
    a ready-to-use system that requires a minimum of technical knowledge for daily
    operations. The graphical display of the smart irrigation system includes needle
    values that represent the real-time sensor data. Colored sections can be applied
    to various measurement sites (widgets) to improve clarity. A red number on the
    water sensor in the tank, which indicates that the water level is critically low,
    is an example of how red color is used to indicate danger. As illustrated in Fig.
    13, the green color denotes no problems, whereas the yellow color stands in the
    center of problems and no problems, indicating the start of a potentially troublesome
    period. The solution also enables tracking of channel locations and particular
    modifications to channel content. In order to do this, a channel sitemap is created,
    which details the placement of feed data. By inputting the latitude and longitude
    coordinates in the “Channel settings” tab of the channel view, the channel location
    may be displayed. The channel map of our system is shown in Fig. 14, which gives
    a summary of the data''s spatial distribution. These functions and visual representations
    help users gain a deeper knowledge of the system''s data, making it simpler for
    them to recognize urgent circumstances and efficiently monitor channel content.

    plants demands close attention. Our Smart Irrigation System seeks to solve this
    by providing an accurate study to guarantee timely and effective plant watering.

    the system''s capabilities, which improve agricultural operations and guarantee

    of observation and testing, it is possible to quantify and demonstrate the decrease
    in water use compared to traditional irrigation techniques. Table 4 may be used
    to show how our intelligent irrigation system, which is based on the IoT and embedded
    technology, lowers the water level: Table 4. Calculated the water usage decrease.1
    System Period Water level (%) Traditional 10 days 100 % Smart Irrigation (IoT)
    10 days 30 % 1 IoT is the acronym of the internet of things. The information gathered
    from the conventional and smart irrigation systems was then compared and examined.
    By subtracting the quantity of water used in a smart irrigation system from the
    amount used in a traditional irrigation system and dividing the result by the
    amount used in a conventional irrigation system, the decrease in water consumption
    can be computed. The water usage of the area''s conventional irrigation system
    should first be monitored and documented. The amount of water utilized during
    a particular time period in this paper''s 10 days was measured using sensors.
    The next step is to install and set up a smart irrigation system based on IoT
    and embedded devices. The system has sensors that can monitor temperature, humidity,
    and other environmental variables including humidity, temperature, moisture, and
    water level. An expected 10-day testing and monitoring period are used to compare
    the smart irrigation system to the conventional irrigation system. The same measurements
    and records are utilized to determine how much water is consumed in a smart irrigation
    system as in a traditional irrigation system. The water level decrease is calculated
    by taking the water level used by the traditional irrigation system (100 %) and
    subtracting the water level used by the smart irrigation system (30 %). The result
    is (100–30)/100, which equals 0.7 or 70 % of the original water level. Reducing
    irrigation water consumption by more than 70 % faces challenges such as potential
    impacts on crops, environmental considerations, climate change adaptation, effective
    soil moisture management, technological limitations, and farmer education. This
    research successfully transforms conventional methodologies by articulating a
    breakthrough in irrigation accuracy and efficiency. It presents a smart irrigation
    system that combines cloud computing, embedded systems, and the IoT. It makes
    use of state-of-the-art sensors, such as DHT22 and water level sensors coupled
    to ESP32, for data transfer to the cloud and real-time monitoring. The accuracy
    and operating efficiency of water-level sensors are enhanced by a new mathematical
    function called linear interpolation. By using 70 % less water, the system that
    has been put in place is in line with environmentally beneficial standards. The
    study explores more general implications for agricultural sustainability and worldwide
    food security, highlighting significant advancements in accuracy and efficacy
    achieved by the suggested smart irrigation system. 4.5. Comparison and discussion
    Table 5 provides a comparative analysis of various IoT-based water use monitoring
    systems, highlighting key functionalities, devices, Parameters, calibration approaches,
    v-models, and their ability to reduce water consumption. The articles included

    (Pramanik et al., 2022) focuses on an IoT-based water usage monitoring system
    using the Croplytics platform with Arduino Uno, LoRa devices, and a GSM model.
    In comparison, our paper (PS) differs by using the ThingSpeak platform and ESP32
    device to monitor temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and water level. Unlike
    paper (Pramanik et al., 2022), our system incorporates sensor calibration, which
    improves data accuracy. In addition, your paper introduces the V Model software
    and helps to reduce water consumption by 70 %, presenting a more advanced and
    comprehensive approach to water conservation. The authors of this work (Abba et
    al., 2019), present an IoT system using Arduino Uno and ThingSpeak to monitor
    humidity, temperature, and soil moisture. Our paper (PS) goes further by using
    ESP32 to improve data collection, covering additional parameters (water level)
    and incorporating sensor calibration for soil moisture and water level measurements.
    This increases the accuracy and reliability of your system''s data. In addition,
    our integration of V Model software and the successful reduction in water consumption
    underlines the depth of our approach beyond what work (Abba et al., 2019) offers.
    The authors of this study (Munir et al., 2021), focus on a water consumption monitoring
    system based on an Android platform with GSM and Arduino Uno models. In contrast,
    our proposed scheme (PS) uses the ESP32 device via the ThingSpeak platform. Our
    system (PS) measures temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and water level, providing
    a wider range of data points compared to the study (Munir et al., 2021). The addition
    of sensor calibration and V Model software to our (PS) study improves the accuracy
    and robustness of our solution. On the other hand, the authors of this study (Pasika
    et al., 2020), presented an Arduino Mega-based system using ThingSpeak to monitor
    soil pH, turbidity, temperature, humidity, and water level. Our PS extends its
    capabilities by using the ESP32 to monitor temperature, humidity, soil moisture,
    and water level. The integration of sensor calibration, Model V software, and
    a 70 % reduction in water consumption in our PS system represent developments
    beyond the scope of this study (Pasika et al., 2020). The authors (García et al.,
    2020), presented a research paper in 2020 related to a study of the latest smart
    irrigation techniques to determine the factors observed in existing systems. This
    paper does not use the realisation of the irrigation system including the integration
    of sensors and embedded systems to drive the irrigation. However, our PS use of
    ESP32, full parameter coverage, sensor calibration, V Model software, and reduced
    water consumption contributes to a more sophisticated and impactful system than
    suggested by the study (García et al., 2020). The authors [29] presented a paper
    focusing on temperature, humidity, and soil moisture monitoring using ATMega328
    and NRF24L01. Our PS features by integrating an ESP32 to monitor temperature,
    humidity, soil moisture, and water level via ThingSpeak. The inclusion of sensor
    calibration, Model V software, and a significant reduction in water consumption
    improve the robustness and efficiency of our solution beyond that proposed in
    the study (Tiglao et al., 2020). The studies conducted by the authors (Abba et
    al., 2019, Tiglao et al., 2020), employed the DHT11 device for temperature and
    humidity measurements. However, this sensor exhibits low accuracy when measuring
    temperatures above zero, rendering decimal value transfer unnecessary and impacting
    agricultural productivity. In contrast, our approach involved utilizing the DHT22
    device which offers the capability of measuring temperatures and humidity, with
    a precision of 0.1 units. This kind of sensor enables more precise and trustworthy
    readings, improving data accuracy and encouraging better agricultural results.
    Our intelligent irrigation system is based on the ESP32, known for its outstanding
    features such as low power consumption, ample memory, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and exceptional
    speed. Moreover, ESP32-based boards are cost-effective and offer analog and digital
    inputs and outputs, making them ideal tools for reading numerous analog input
    values in intelligent farming and Smart Irrigation Systems. The estimated total
    cost of the proposed intelligent irrigation system is approximately US $60, making
    it an affordable and cost-effective solution. This low-cost nature of the system
    aligns with our goal of providing a practical and accessible option, particularly
    for low-income farmers, in contrast to the methods described by the authors in
    systems (Pramanik et al., 2022, Abba et al., 2019). In contrast to conventional
    irrigation methods that rely on groundwater drainage and can lead to excessive
    water consumption and crop flooding, our system utilizes innovative technologies
    to provide precise and demand-based soil irrigation. By adapting to the specific
    water needs of the crops, our system has the potential to significantly reduce
    water usage by more than 70 %. This efficient and targeted approach ensures optimal
    resource utilization while promoting sustainable agriculture practices. None of
    the scientific papers referenced in this study have used the V model. In contrast,
    our paper which used the V model software design, presents a methodical and organized
    approach to software development, significantly improving the overall quality
    of our irrigation system. 4.6. Smart irrigation improves food security The use
    of the IoT, cloud computing, and other cutting-edge technologies in Smart Irrigation
    Systems can have a significant impact on food security as seen in the Fig. 16.
    Here are some of the ways this technology enhances food security: (1) Improved
    Crop Yields: By implementing intelligent irrigation systems based on IoT to provide
    crops with the right quantity of water at the right time, crop yields may be boosted.
    This can help ensure a steady supply of food by reducing the likelihood of crop
    failures caused by droughts or other environmental factors. (2) Improved Water
    Efficiency: Smart irrigation systems based on IoT use information from sensors
    and weather stations to choose the best irrigation schedule, reducing water waste
    and maximizing water efficiency. (3) Remote Access and Control: Through a mobile
    application, smart irrigation systems using IoT can be accessed and operated remotely,
    allowing farmers to check on and make adjustments to their irrigation systems
    even when they are not in their fields. Farmers who live in rural places or who
    have access issues owing to physical restrictions may find this to be of particular
    benefit. (4) Making Decisions Based on Data: Intelligent irrigation systems based
    on IoT gather a lot of information on soil moisture, weather, and crop growth.
    This information may be used to make better decisions about crop planning, irrigation
    schedules, and other aspects that impact crop yields. (5) Climate Change Adaptation:
    Smart irrigation systems based on IoT can assist farmers in adapting to the shifting
    weather patterns brought on by climate change. These devices can assist farmers
    in modifying their irrigation schedules and other management measures to take
    into account such as changes in temperature, precipitation, and other environmental
    factors by giving real-time data on soil moisture and meteorological conditions.

    in smart irrigation systems has the potential to have a significant influence
    on food security. In addition to increasing agricultural yields and water efficiency,
    these technologies also enable remote monitoring and data-driven decision-making,
    all of which may help ensure a more reliable food supply. This essay will examine
    how smart irrigation affects food security and how it may help maintain agriculture.
    The research paper highlighted smart irrigation systems as a groundbreaking approach
    to integrating new technologies like the IoT, embedded systems, and cloud computing.
    One notable innovation is the real-time data transmission to the ThingSpeak cloud
    and the visualization of the data through the ThingView app. This implementation
    allows for seamless monitoring and control of the irrigation system. By leveraging
    these technologies, the paper enables farmers and agricultural stakeholders to
    access vital information about soil moisture, temperature, and other environmental
    parameters in real-time. This innovation improves decision-making processes, enhances
    resource management, and promotes sustainable agricultural practices. The utilization
    of the ThingSpeak cloud and ThingView app for data visualization represents a
    significant advancement in smart agriculture, providing a user-friendly interface
    for efficient irrigation management. This paper presented a mathematical method
    for sensor calibration that brings innovation to the field by ensuring precise
    and reliable measurements. Additionally, the V model software design offers a
    systematic and structured approach to software development, enhancing the overall
    quality of our irrigation system. The paper focus on examining the impact of smart
    irrigation on food security. Better resource management in smart irrigation systems
    results in more sustainable, efficient, and environmentally friendly agricultural
    practices, with observable benefits in terms of water conservation, energy efficiency,
    crop yield, cost reduction, and overall agricultural sustainability. The analysis
    and interpretation of data in smart agriculture transforms the raw data of sensors
    into actionable information through many functions such as data cleaning and integration,
    application of advanced analytics, providing visual representations, interpreting
    models and providing real-time recommendations to farmers for informed decision-making
    and optimized farming practices. 5. Conclusion and future work In conclusion,
    the article proposed the concept of a “smart irrigation system using embedded
    Systems, IoT, and cloud computing” as an innovative solution to enhance food security
    and promote sustainable agriculture. By harnessing advanced technologies, this
    system aims to optimize irrigation practices, conserve water resources, and support
    long-term agricultural sustainability. The system makes use of cutting-edge technology
    like cloud computing, embedded system, and the IoT to provide real-time monitoring,
    control, and data analysis of irrigation operations. This system supervised real-time
    monitoring of crucial environmental factors such as moisture, humidity, temperature,
    and water levels in smart agriculture practices. The system used the ThingSpeak
    cloud to enable wireless communication between the device and the farm owner,
    enhancing their interaction. Furthermore, the ESP32 controller is linked to both
    a watering pump for soil irrigation and a water pump to refill the tank during
    low water levels. The automated control of the two water pumps is based on the
    readings of various environmental factors. Farmers can access comprehensive farm
    data from anywhere in the world as the sensor data is transmitted in real-time
    to both the ThingSpeak cloud and the ThingView application. This capability allows
    for more precise crop irrigation and increased production. Moreover, this will
    also present a mathematical-driven function known as linear interpolation to calibrate
    the water level sensor in percentage. This smart irrigation system was created
    using the V model software development approach. The solution suggested in this
    paper uses 70 % less water for soil irrigation than conventional techniques. In
    addition, this paper addressed the impact of smart irrigation using the latest
    technology on food security and its ability to support sustainable agriculture.
    The implementation of this smart irrigation system has the potential to revolutionize
    the agricultural sector, addressing key challenges and paving the way for a more
    secure and sustainable food production system. The future work of this paper involves
    integrating modern technologies and utilizing an MQTT broker to enhance the Smart
    Irrigation System. By merging multiple nodes, the system can handle increased
    data analysis and control elements for large-scale applications such as smart
    farms spanning thousands of hectares. The MQTT broker can further optimize irrigation
    strategies and resource management. On the other hand, future work of this paper
    will include the integration of the concept of smart agriculture within the framework
    of cyber-physical human systems. Declaration of competing interest The authors

  description: 'The agriculture sector is one of the largest consumers of fresh water.
    Different types of irrigation systems are available, including center pivot, drip

    of existing irrigation systems and their high maintenance costs encourage Indian
    farmers to continue using these methods. Due to its ease of use and low energy
    consumption, surface irrigation is one of the most popular irrigation techniques.

    in both developed and developing countries. By 2050, the world’s population is
    expected to reach 10 billion, requiring a 70% increase in food production. Sustainable
    agriculture principles must be followed to ensure food security for this growing
    population [ 1, 2]. The objectives of sustainable agriculture are to enhance agricultural
    productivity and reduce the negative effects of outdated farming methods on the
    environment. Developing advanced agricultural practices necessitates substantial
    research and development, especially in the field of irrigation, which accounts
    for 70% of the total freshwater resources. Internet of Things (IoT) and machine
    learning (ML) systems can help monitor, control, and plan irrigation for agricultural
    regions, ensuring efficient use of freshwater resources [ 3, 4]. Smart agriculture
    systems utilize IoT and artificial intelligence to collect and transmit autonomous
    data to data centers. Artificial neural networks and clustering evaluate data
    to make informed decisions, improving the efficiency of agricultural systems [
    5, 6]. A range of IoT and ML irrigation systems have been created with the aim
    of monitoring and controlling irrigation systems. An irrigation system prototype
    has been designed that integrates sensors and an energy module at the top of the
    sprinkler [ 7]. Another example connects a soil moisture sensor to the Internet
    to track soil moisture, while a different irrigation system uses ML to assess
    data on air quality, temperature, and humidity to schedule irrigation [ 8]. The
    management of water is extremely important due to its scarcity. As a substantial
    portion of fresh water is needed for irrigation, this influences agriculture as
    well [ 9]. There are many different types of irrigation methods available, such
    as flood irrigation, trickle irrigation, drip irrigation, and spray irrigation
    [ 10]. Irrigation planning involves monitoring agricultural factors such as temperature,
    humidity, and soil moisture. Open-source platforms, such as Arduino UNO, are used
    in irrigation management systems. Efficient management of water resources is crucial
    for increasing yields and meeting future food demand in areas with limited resources
    [ 11]. We can irrigate more areas with the same amount of water if we use a controlled
    irrigation system. In this study, we develop a method for irrigation prediction
    to effectively control intelligent autonomous irrigation. To estimate the amount
    of irrigation required for each crop, the suggested method uses the IoT. We took
    the following four steps: (1) Install the sensors for water, rain, temperature,
    soil moisture, wind, etc. (2) Connecting the sensor set to a data collection system.
    (3) Using an IoT server to transfer data to an application after storing it on
    a ThingSpeak cloud server. (4) Various algorithms, including K-nearest neighbors
    (KNN), Naïve Bayes (NB), random forest (RF), SVM, and logistic regression (LR),
    are used to analyze the data. This automated irrigation method will be extremely
    useful for large-scale irrigation systems. This will both simplify the labor-intensive
    process of irrigation for plants and improve water management. The concept of
    a related study and the proposed automated irrigation system are presented in
    the article. Section 2 presents a state-of-the-art study on ML, precision irrigation,
    automated irrigation systems, and ML algorithms for irrigation prediction, along
    with comparisons with previous research. Section 3 presents the proposed irrigation
    system design. Section 4 displays the results of the system testing and analysis.
    Future work recommendations are provided in Section 5. The conclusions of the
    suggested study are finally summarized in Section 6. 2. Literature Review This
    section covers the contributions of several researchers in the fields of IoT and
    ML for automated irrigation systems for agriculture. In this research, a ML algorithm-based,
    intelligent, adaptable irrigation technique for smart agriculture is presented.
    For the best possible plant development, it uses sensors for temperature, moisture
    content in the soil, and rainfall. A variety of models, including KNN, LR, neural
    networks, SVM, and NB, are utilized to evaluate the data collected using the node-RED
    platform and MongoDB [ 12]. The IoT and cloud-based architecture are used to analyze
    a smart irrigation system in this article. The device detects the humidity and
    moisture content of the soil; ML methods are used to analyze the data. The system
    uses ML algorithms to forecast the ideal amount of fresh water for crop production,
    which results in significant water savings. The agricultural industry is predicted
    to change due to this technology [ 13]. To solve irrigation-related problems,
    the researcher developed a solution that uses ML and the IoT. Pressure, pH, temperature,
    humidity, and other sensor types are included in the hardware. The pH sensor measures
    the pH of the soil and forecasts water requirements. The aim is to develop automated
    irrigation systems and save water for future usage. Improvements in agricultural
    water efficiency and conservation are the objectives of the initiative [ 14].
    In this, a low-cost and intelligent agricultural irrigation system is presented.
    The constructed prototype uses a hardware sensor and a unit to monitor temperature,
    humidity, and water level. To determine whether to turn on or off the motor, the
    study uses a variety of sensors to collect various readings and values. The IoT-based
    automated system uses applications to establish an independent irrigation system.
    It also sends SMS messages to our mobile devices, providing us with remote updates
    on irrigation field details [ 15]. Research has developed a smart irrigation system
    that estimates the depth of crop water (WUD) for tomato planting based on real-time
    soil moisture data. A central irrigation controller was used to collect the data,
    guaranteeing an accurate irrigation depth at every irrigation event. The experiment
    was carried out in a Northern Chinese greenhouse [ 16]. This research suggests
    that instead of using physical sensors in a smart irrigation system, neural networks
    based on long–short-term memory (LSTM) should be used. The system computes transpiration
    in each field by transmitting temperature, humidity, and soil moisture data via
    physical sensors. LM35 is used for temperature, DHT-22 is used for humidity, and
    a bespoke sensor is used for moisture readings. Real-time data were collected.
    The findings indicate that the neural sensor suggested based on deep learning
    has a high degree of accuracy when predicting real-time data, especially those
    related to wetness, temperature, and humidity. This shows that a neural network
    can improve the performance of physical sensors in agricultural settings, increasing
    the dependability of smart irrigation systems [ 17]. In the research, the researcher
    developed a framework that combines IoT with various metrics and methodologies
    to monitor data related to temperature, humidity, and soil moisture. This approach
    offers farmers the ability to analyze data in real-time, allowing them to monitor
    soil moisture, temperature, and automated irrigation systems more efficiently,
    with reduced use of time and energy, and in decision-making analysis specifically
    designed for farmers [ 18]. A method was developed to increase the efficiency
    of irrigation for cotton crops. Researchers have examined a variety of data sets
    to calculate the exact amount of water required for a particular soil combination.
    A mobile application makes the results of analytical research accessible to farmers
    or other users [ 19]. Table 1 illustrates some more previous research on automated
    irrigation systems for smart agriculture. Table 1  Previous research work and
    future recommendations on automated irrigation system. This article focuses on
    research on an autonomous irrigation management system for agricultural fields.
    The system uses a mobile application for data consultation and analysis in real-time,
    as well as a wireless sensor and actuator network. RF produced the best results
    with an accuracy of 84.6% when ML techniques were employed to estimate the optimal
    timing for water administration. An approach is also included in the system to
    figure out how much water is required for field management. Water management technology
    that is both effective and efficient, as shown by the ability of the system to
    save up to 60% of the water used [ 27]. ML and deep learning technologies can
    be used to improve crop yield and manage irrigation in agriculture. These approaches
    exemplify the fast progress of artificial intelligence in the agricultural industry.
    The concept of smart farming encompasses monitoring all agricultural processes,
    predicting diseases, managing agricultural pests, and automated irrigation [ 28].
    The article presents a machine-learning and IoT-based irrigation system that improves
    efficiency. Sensors on a Raspberry Pi measure soil temperature and moisture content
    using the serial peripheral interface protocol. The NB technique is used to train
    a ML model that regulates the irrigation system with an accuracy of 98.33%. A
    prototype project with a water pump and relay is also built to demonstrate the
    precise operation of the system [ 29]. Table 2 illustrates previous research on
    the automated irrigation system for smart agriculture using ML. Table 2  Previous
    research on supervised machine learning models for automated irrigation system.
    3. Proposed Hybrid Irrigation System One of the essential stages in the production
    of agricultural products is irrigation. Agricultural uses account for around 80%
    of the entire water supply, although the amount of water available varies considerably
    from region to region. The adoption of microirrigation technology takes an hour.
    But farmers still adhere to an old irrigation pattern, which causes a huge loss
    of water. Existing sprinkler systems are not suitable for all crops. The height
    of the sprinkler irrigation is 4 feet, so it cannot irrigate crops greater than
    4 feet. In drip and sprinkler irrigation systems, the pipe structure of the system
    spreads throughout the field, making intercultural operations difficult. Binding
    up the system during harvesting and sawing new crops leads to damage to pipes
    as well as to crops and to a highly labor-consuming process. Damage due to rodents
    is more common in fixed-set irrigation systems. The center pivot irrigation system
    and the linear move irrigation system are constructed of heavy pipes and are complex
    structured. They are not suitable for fields of unusual shapes because of their
    high capital and maintenance requirements. Related research and findings are discussed
    in the literature review, and future work recommendations are shown in Table 1.
    To overcome these problems, we proposed a hybrid irrigation system that would
    be able to automatically irrigate different crops from a remote location. The
    objective of the proposed hybrid irrigation system is to overcome the problems
    of existing systems. The suggested smart irrigation architecture is shown in Figure
    1.    Figure 1  Proposed architecture for smart irrigation. This research has
    developed a smart irrigation system that automatically waters crops without human
    involvement. As a center pivot and linear move irrigation system, it also irrigates
    crops with vertical sprinkles, but in a center pivot and linear move irrigation
    system, farmers need heavy machinery, power supply, or human resources to move
    the system in the field to meet the irrigation requirements. The proposed irrigation
    system is a stable and user-friendly model. It is designed in a T shape, which
    is fixed in the field with some distance, and irrigates the field with sprinklers.
    The system uses moisture sensors to measure the moisture content of the soil in
    fields. When the moisture levels drop below the minimum level, the NodeMCU board
    activates the water pump, providing water to the crop. The water sensor also monitors
    the conditions of the water reservoir, sending signals to the NodeMCU when the
    reservoir is empty. Wind speed sensors measure the wind speed on the farm, while
    rain sensors detect the rain status in the field. The data from soil moisture
    sensors are displayed on an LCD screen. Solenoid valves are embedded to control
    water flow in different farms. If soil moisture drops below the threshold value
    for farm field A, the solenoid valves are activated, while the remaining valves
    remain off. This irrigation system helps farmers irrigate their fields with less
    labor and time. The hybrid irrigation system is built with the ability to automatically
    irrigate crops, considering factors such as weather conditions, temperature, humidity,
    and soil moisture. Taxonomy is used to consider the choice of climatic and soil
    conditions, while our sensor network keeps track of factors, such as temperature,
    humidity, and soil moisture. In contrast to the three levels of conventional IoT
    design (application layer, network layer, and perception layer), our proposed
    IoT architecture comprises four layers: application layer, processing layer, transport
    layer, and perception layer. Sensors are included in the physical layer, often
    referred to as the perception layer, to collect data such as soil moisture level,
    air humidity and temperature, rainfall level and wind speed. Using networks like
    Wi-Fi, 2G, 3G, and LAN, sensing data that has already been acquired is sent from
    the transport layer to the processing layer. The transport layer sends massive
    amounts of data to the processing layer, which stores, analyzes, and processes
    it. It uses modern tools, such as cloud servers and the IoT. The main goal of
    the application layer is to provide user-specific application services. Our system
    manages the sensors, GSM module, ThingSpeak cloud server, IoT server, Android
    application (Blynk application), and other components. We have been able to prepare
    our system for complete autonomy thanks to these technologies. 3.1. Architecture
    of the Proposed System and Working Principals This research developed a method
    for automatic watering by measuring ground moisture values. This smart irrigation
    system allows farmers to control and adjust irrigation with fewer human resources.
    Figure 2 shows the block diagram of the hybrid irrigation system.    Figure 2  System
    block diagram. The NodeMCU is an open-source platform that utilizes the ESP8266
    to facilitate the connection of devices and enable the transmission of data via
    the Wi-Fi protocol. Different types of sensors are used to control the irrigation
    system and monitor the field. Sensors such as soil moisture sensor, wind sensor,
    water level sensor, rain detection sensor, temperature, and humidity sensor, etc.,
    node MCU 8266 is used in this prototype as main board. A soil moisture sensor
    is used to measure soil moisture content in the field. The required soil moisture
    threshold value is described, and if soil moisture exceeds or decreases from the
    threshold value, the soil moisture sensor will send the current soil moisture
    value to the server through the node MCU. The updated current soil moisture value
    is sent to the application, and the farmer can start irrigation according to the
    minimum water requirements of the crops from a remote location automatically.
    Water sensor is utilized to monitor the water status at the dam. If the water
    dam is empty, then it will send the empty signals to the application, and at the
    same time, a buzzer is used to indicate an empty water dam if someone is around
    the field to shut down the motor manual. A wind speed sensor is used to measure
    the wind speed. Wind speed plays an important role in sprinkler water, so if wind
    speed is high, the farmer can turn off the motor to reduce water waste. Solenoid
    valves control water flow on different farms. If soil moisture decreases below
    the threshold value for a farm field, solenoid valves activate for that farm,
    while the remaining valves remain off for other farms. An LCD screen is used to
    display soil moisture from all fields for quick review of soil moisture at field
    level. This innovative approach benefits farmers who struggle to irrigate crops.
    After the sensors were attached to the board, we started programing the board
    to control the sensors in a way that made it possible for different types of data
    to be collected and transferred in real-time. Then, we utilized the ThingSpeak
    cloud server to ensure data storage, and we used the application to monitor and
    operate the irrigation system. We then aggregated several months of data so that
    we could train it to anticipate when to start or stop pumping and close the valve.
    3.2. System Working Flowchart The flowchart of the proposed system provides the
    basic principles of the system and an overview, as shown in Figure 3.    Figure
    3  Working flowchart system. The working steps are as follows: (1) In Step 2,
    the system analyzes the sensor data. (2) In Step 3, the node MCU esp8266 may be
    used to initialize the system. (3) Step 4: The server/application gets information
    from numerous sensors deployed in the agricultural field, including the soil moisture
    sensor, wind sensor, humidity sensor, rain sensor, and water level sensor. (4)
    In Step 5, the soil moisture sensor continuously measures the soil moisture content.
    If the soil moisture is below the required threshold level, the signals are sent
    to the application and the node MCU. The solenoid valves attached to that soil
    moisture sensor will turn on when the update is transmitted to the node MCU, but
    the solenoid valves connected to other sensors will stay optimal. (5) In Step
    6, the motor that is attached to the relay will be turned on either through the
    application or manually. (6) In Step 7, when the amount of soil moisture reaches
    the required threshold level, the relay will automatically turn the motor off
    and the solenoid valves off. (7) In Step 8, the other sensors continuously read
    the data and transmit it to the server or application. For example, a water level
    sensor monitors the water level in the dam; if the dam is empty, the application
    is updated with an empty status, and the buzzer starts beeping. The wind speed
    sensor and the temperature sensor continuously monitor the wind speed and temperature
    of the field because both factors play an important role in irrigation. High temperatures
    and wind speeds cause water loss during irrigation. By monitoring the field, irrigation
    can be scheduled according to temperature and wind speed. (8) In Step 9, once
    Steps 7 and 8 have been completed, the system will go to Step 2. (9) In Step 10,
    the system reads the data from the field and transmits it to the application.
    This operation will continue until the system’s input power is turned off. 3.3.
    Hybrid Irrigation System Design 3.3.1. Hardware Implementation To develop the
    hybrid irrigation system, few steps are performed: Hybrid irrigation model structure
    is shown in Figure 4.    Figure 4  Hybrid irrigation model structure. (1) The
    material is cut into the desired length dimension of the structure is 1.2 into
    0.17 into 0.4 m. (2) The project structure is designed in upside down U-shape
    structure and T-shape hybrid irrigation system. (3) Eight millimeters water pipe
    is used as a main supply pipe. Six millimeters water pipe is used for subpipeline
    for supply the water to field. (4) T and L shape pipe connectors are used to connect
    the subpipe with main pipes and solenoid valves. 3.3.2. Software Implementation
    As mentioned previously, the NodeMCU requires a supply voltage of 5 V DC to operate
    the circuit components. The DHT 11 sensor data pin is connected to the node MCU
    pin D2 and GND and VCC to (ground, 3.3 V), soil moisture sensor connected to the
    A0 pin of the Arduino Uno and connected with the D4 pin of the node MCU, and GND,
    VCC pin connected with the ground pin, 3.3 V, soil moisture sensor b, connected
    to the A1 pin of the Arduino Uno and connected with the D8 pin of the node MCU,
    and GND, VCC pin connected with the pin ground, 3.3 V. The rain detection sensor
    is linked to the node MCU via pin D5. The water sensor is connected to that digital
    pin of node MCU D6 and the buzzer is connected to the digital pin of node MCU
    D7. If the water level is low, the D7 pin gets a signal and the buzzer will beep
    out. LCD display connected with the digital pins of the Arduino Uno RS = 7, EN = 6,
    D4 = 5, D5 = 4, D6 = 3, D7 = 2. Wind speed sensor connected to the analog pin
    of node MCU A0. To connect the water pump motor and the solenoid valves, we will
    need a relay module. Relay 1 will take the signal input value from soil moisture
    sensor 1 and relay 2 will take the signal from soil moisture sensor2. Relay 1
    is connected to the digital pin of Arduino D8 and relay 2 is connected to the
    digital pin of Arduino Uno D9. Relay 1 will control the two solenoid valves, solenoid
    valve 1A and solenoid valve 1B, and relay will control the two solenoid valves
    called solenoid valves 2A and 2B. The motor is connected to the third relay and
    the relay is connected to the digital pin D1 of the node MCU. Transistors and
    resistors are used to regulate the voltage within a range of 3-5 volts to safeguard
    sensors and equipment from excessive voltage fluctuations. For the operation of
    the system, we used 5 volts of DC power for the node MCU and 2 volts of power
    for the Arduino Uno, along with one USB cable to complete the power supply to
    the Arduino Uno. Twelve volt power supply is connected with the solenoid valves
    and motor and with the relays. To establish the communication between hardware
    and the blink application, we need to establish the communication between the
    hardware and the blink application. We need to set the virtual connection between
    the sensors and the blink application. Data from DHT 11 sensors were sent to the
    blynk server using the virtual connection V0, V1, and V2. The rain sensor connected
    to the virtual pin V6 and the water sensor is connected to the virtual pin V7
    soil moisture one connected to the virtual and pin V8 8 and the soil moisture
    sensor 2 connected to the virtual pin V9. Wind speed sensor pin is connected to
    the virtual pin V4 and V5, and the water pump relay is connected with the virtual
    V3 pin to control the water motor. Sensor’s connectivity with node MCU and Arduino
    Uno R3 is represented in Figure 5. Several tools are included in the software
    design method that are necessary for the system to function properly. A few of
    them are as follows:    Figure 5  Sensors connectivity with node MCU and Arduino
    Uno R3. (1) Firmware developed using C/C++ with the Arduino IDE. (2) The ThingSpeak
    cloud server was used to collect and store data for further analysis. (3) Data
    visualization for field control and monitoring is done using the Blynk application.
    (4) Real-time data are collected and sent to the ThingSpeak cloud server after
    the same code is updated to send data to the Blynk application to control and
    monitor sensor data automatically through the application. (5) To simplify the
    access and control of the system, a Wi-Fi or Internet service provider is used.
    (6) For data analysis, Jupiter Notebook and Anaconda are used. 3.3.3. Hybrid Irrigation
    System Working Application An Android application is being developed for farmers
    to monitor and control the hybrid irrigation system. Input parameters such as
    soil moisture, wind speed, rain status, water, temperature, and humidity are displayed
    in an application. The farmer will be able to monitor and control field conditions
    at any time and from anywhere. With the help of this application, the farmer will
    control the motor switch and irrigate the crop according to the requirements and
    availability of water. The mobile application is shown in Figure 6.    Figure
    6  Blynk smart irrigation application. 4. Machine Learning Analysis Algorithms
    This section presents supervised machine learning algorithms to analyze the performance
    of the automated irrigation system. Supervised learning is a method where models
    are trained on a training data set to produce the desired output. This process
    involves acquiring knowledge and improving performance over time. The model’s
    precision is evaluated using a loss function, and adjustments are made until the
    error is reduced. This research utilizes a set of supervised machine learning
    algorithms such as LR, KNN, support vector machine (SVM), NB, and RF classifiers.
    Table 2 presents the results of previous research studies that utilized supervised
    machine learning techniques to analyze a smart irrigation system. The research
    presents a machine learning-based irrigation strategy for smart agriculture using
    sensors like soil humidity, temperature, and rain. The node-RED platform and MongoDB
    collect data, with KNN achieving 98.3% accuracy. A web application visualizes
    and supervises the environment [ 12]. This study examines a smart irrigation system
    that utilizes the IoT and a cloud-based architecture. This technology is developed
    to monitor the moisture and humidity content of the soil and then use several
    machine learning algorithms for analyzing the data in the cloud. Farmers receive
    accurate information on water content requirements. Intelligent irrigation may
    help farmers use less water [ 13]. In this research, we proposed a new irrigation
    model (T-shaped sprinkler irrigation). Different types of sensors are used to
    collect data from the field, like soil moisture sensors, wind sensors, temperature
    sensors, rain sensors, water level sensors, etc. All sensors are connected to
    the node MCU and UNO to control and collect data from the field. Data collected
    from the agriculture field is stored on the ThingsSpeak cloud server. A total
    of 3,000 lines of data are collected for analysis using machine learning algorithms
    to calculate the accuracy of the working automated irrigation system. From the
    collected data, 80% was used for training purposes, and 20% was used for testing
    the algorithms. After collecting the data for analysis, we developed an application
    for monitoring and controlling the irrigation. The algorithms used for the classification
    of automated hybrid irrigation systems are described below. 4.1. Support Vector
    Machine SVM is a machine learning technique that is used for classification and
    regression tasks and is specifically designed to identify objects within given
    data sets. This method effectively divides n-dimensional spaces into various classes,
    making data entry efficient. The research used the kernel trick mechanism of SVMs
    for classification purposes. This technique includes the transformation of 2D
    nonlinear separable data sets into higher dimensions, such as three, four, or
    10 dimensions [ 30]: 4.2. Naïve Bayes Thomas Bayes (1702–1761) developed the Naïve
    Bayesian approach to probabilistic machine learning, which is based on the Bayes
    theorem. The likelihood of A occurring given that B has already happened can be
    used to describe this theorem. Considering X = (x1,…, xn) is the features, and
    Y is the class variable, in this sentence. The NB algorithm is unique in that
    it assumes that each characteristic is independent of the others and that modifying
    one feature will not affect any other. Despite appearing straightforward, NB has
    turned out to be a useful classification system: 4.3. Logistic Regression LR is
    a supervised machine-learning method used for classification tasks. This method
    is used to determine the probability of the dependent variable. The target variable
    has a binary nature, indicating that it may only assume one of two potential classes:
    success (represented by 1 or yes) or failure (represented by 0 or no). The classification
    of this may be categorized into three main types: binary or binomial, multinomial,
    and ordinal. The equation for linear regression may be expressed as the equation
    of a straight line: 4.4. K-Nearest Neighbors The KNN method is a supervised learning
    approach often used in machine learning. The algorithm operates on the assumption
    that there exists a degree of similarity between the newly acquired data and the
    data that are already accessible. When assigning the newly acquired data to the
    category that exhibits the highest degree of similarity with the existing categories,
    the KNN algorithm uses the Manhattan equation to calculate the distance within
    this framework. The formula for the Manhattan distance is shown in Equation (4)
    [ 12]: 4.5. Random Forest Ensemble learning is a powerful teaching strategy. For
    categorization purposes, RF is commonly used. Each decision tree’s planned output
    is represented by the forest’s output, and the categorization is based on the
    information gathered from the many decision trees created during training. Random
    forest decreases variance in the final model, improves performance, and controls
    overfitting by building decision trees using random samples of the training data
    [ 8]. 4.6. Collecting and Storing Data Automated modeling and continuous collection
    of real-time measurements of environmental factors, such as soil moisture levels,
    temperature, humidity, and pump activity, were taken into consideration when developing
    the hybrid smart irrigation system based on the IoT. To perform the analysis,
    the ThingSpeak cloud server is used to collect data from all sensors. We began
    implementing these devices in various environments with various soil conditions
    in the mass collection process using IoT technologies, which are made up of many
    autonomous devices in the form of sensors capable of self-organization and working
    to collect information. It was built to distribute the data using an algorithm
    to provide an essential interface during the project. This was a practically complete
    implementation of our data set. Data collected from different sensors with different
    ranges are discussed below. (1) Soil moisture data: As shown in Table 3, these
    data are generated by an analog sensor over a range of values between 0 and 1,023.
    We can see that the smallest value is 314.51 and the maximum value is 984.82,
    meaning that the average value is 654.5. (2) Temperature data: A DHT11 temperature
    sensor was used to collect air temperature data from the environment in the form
    of Celsius. We can observe that the average temperature throughout the collected
    months was 26.24, exceeding both its upper and lower limitations. The minimum
    value during this time was 18.00, and the highest temperature during this time
    was 38.99. (3) Data on air humidity: We were able to acquire data on air humidity
    using the same temperature sensor that helped with collecting air temperature
    values, and the following is an analysis of those data. The average was 66.4%
    while collecting the massive amount of data, with the lowest value being 38% and
    the highest value being 81.26%. Table 3  Analysis data set. The study suggests
    an automated design based on the peer-to-peer concept, using data that can be
    classified with values that vary from 0 to 1. The final design was implemented
    to show its feasibility and prevent major problems. The data collected from all
    sensors are shown in Table 3. 4.7. Results and Analysis of Machine Learning Algorithms
    Any machine learning method, including KNN, NB, LR, RF, and SVMs, which are all
    classification dilemma handling algorithms, can forecast the degree of irrigation
    demand. In this paper, all the abovementioned techniques are used to analyze the
    collected data. For experimental analysis, a collection of 3,000 data recordings
    was collected. These factors include soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and
    the water pump for irrigation decision-making. Five machine learning algorithms,
    KNN, NB, LR, RF, and SVMs, were utilized in an experimental investigation. Two
    different colors are used to represent the graph. Red colors are used to represent
    0, and blue colors represent 1. To achieve better accuracy and application modeling,
    the data available on soil moisture, air temperature, humidity, and motor working
    status are divided into two sets: the training data set and the testing data set.
    The training set contains 80% of the data, and 20% is used for testing and validation.
    The training data set is used to train the different machine learning algorithms,
    and the testing data set is used to test the models, which will help to find the
    accuracy of their workings and the best machine learning algorithm. Figure 7 represents
    the training data and test data in a graphical view.    Figure 7  Graph displays
    training and test data. The real-time collected data from field are stored for
    analysis using different machine learning algorithms. The data collection process
    is done on a ThingSpeak cloud server and published on Mendeley Data [ 37]. Table
    3 shows the data for making training predictions, looking at presorted data, and
    showing outcomes. After analyzing all five machine learning algorithms, the results
    from the models used in this study are shown together with their accuracy and
    mean square error (RMSE) in Table 4. The same outcome is shown in Figure 8, as
    in a graph.    Figure 8  The output of our models is shown in a graph. Table 4  Models
    anàlisis result. (1) The output of the KNN model is shown in Line 1, where the
    corresponding red and blue colors of the training and testing sets stand in for
    the pumping points between “0” and “1.” All the data points supplied in red and
    green are shown to be integrated into their surroundings by the model, respectively.
    The model’s rate of accuracy in describing the outcomes is 98.3%. (2) Line 2 displays
    a 99.8% accuracy rate and a 0.16 means-square error for the RF model. (3) Line
    3 shows the results of the NB model with a 98.8% accuracy rate and a 0.16 means-square
    error. (4) In Line 4, where the SVM model’s results are displayed and as a result,
    the mean square error is 0.66 and the accuracy rate is 99.3%. (5) Finally, a LR
    model with a mean square error that is very nearly 0.5 and a rate of accuracy
    of 99.5%. The accuracy of ML algorithms is determined through training and validation
    processes. Various machine learning algorithms provide satisfactory results after
    performing analysis of the collected data. As we can see, the accuracy rates of
    the NB and RF model of 98.8% and the MSE of 0.16 are higher compared to KNN, SVM,
    and LR with successive results: (98.3%/1.66), (99.3%/0.66), and (99.5%/0.5), respectively.
    5. Future Work Recommendations To increase the efficiency of the system, some
    recommendations are listed for future research work: (1) To maintain the soil
    quality, there is a need to monitor soil salt rate and pH level of the soil. (2)
    To increase the crop production to fulfill the future needs, controlling and monitoring
    of the fertilization process are required to be utilized with the existing smart
    irrigation process. (3) Improvement of the system is done by adding new controllers
    and sensors to increase the stability, reliability, structure, and working efficiency
    of the system. (4) Artificial intelligent system will be installed with the irrigation
    system to predict the user action, rainfall condition patterns, and time to harvest
    extra. (5) To estimate the water requirement for irrigation process, water meter
    can be installed in the irrigation systems. (6) In this project, motor is controlled
    from mobile application, fully automated motor system should be installed. (7)
    Cameras can be used for detecting the deeds and for controlling and monitoring
    the plant growth. (8) Alarm system can be installed in the smart agriculture system
    for alerting the farmers regarding the fire and the any movement in the agriculture
    field. This can be achieved using the fire sensor and motion detector sensor.
    (9) Decision making can be done using the big data and artificial intelligent
    technologies. These technologies will help the smart irrigation for past and future
    data prediction in the IoT system. 6. Conclusion Increased production is an important
    first step since it will be necessary to meet the projected 70% rise in global
    food consumption by 2050. The management of water consumption for irrigation is
    another aspect of it. In this research, a hybrid irrigation system is suggested.
    Three modules make up our suggested approach to smart irrigation: As the first
    module, the sensor network identifies variables affecting the requirement for
    water. We use sensors such as DHT11, a capacitive soil moisture sensor, a wind
    sensor, a rain sensor, and a water level sensor to measure temperature, soil moisture,
    temperature, humidity in the air, wind speed, rain status, and reservoir water
    level. In the second module, we utilize the ThingSpeak cloud server and the Bylnk
    cloud server as IoT servers to send and receive data. In the third module, we
    used machine learning algorithms to analyze the data and determine how accurate
    the decision-making process was to determine the need for irrigation. KNN, NB,
    LR, and RF were just a few of the models we used to analyze the data we collected.
    When comparing the accuracy rates and mean squared errors of different models,
    the NB and RF models have an accuracy rate of 98.8% and MSE of 0.16. In comparison,
    the KNN, SVM, and logistic regression models have accuracy rates of 98.3%, 99.3%,
    and 99.5%, with corresponding MSE values of 1.66, 0.66, and 0.5, respectively.

    Agricultural practices are rapidly changing in the face of the increasing demand
    for food and water resources. Traditional methods of irrigation have proven to
    be inefficient, causing water scarcity and soil degradation. The concept of aquaponics,
    a combination of aquaculture and hydroponics, offers an alternative solution to
    sustainable agriculture. It utilizes a closed-loop system where fish and plants
    are grown in the same environment, creating a symbiotic relationship where the
    waste from fish is utilized as nutrients for plants, and the plants clean the
    water for the fish. Fish waste is converted into nitrates by bacteria present
    in the soil, which can be readily absorbed by the plants. This system also provides
    the plants with a much more consistent nutrient supply as compared to traditional
    irrigation systems. Experts say that the aquaponic way of irrigation conserves
    as much as 90% of the water that is wasted in traditional irrigation systems.
    It is also observed that plants grow faster in this system because nutrients are
    readily available to them and they do not have to expend energy searching for
    them. Overall, the nutrient-rich, controlled environment of an aquaponics system
    provides the ideal conditions for plant growth, making it a superior option for
    growing plants. The proposed system takes various samples of tap water as well
    as Potheri Lake water with varying differences in pH, turbidity, and water temperature.
    The pH level of lake water can vary widely depending on various factors such as
    the surrounding environment, the presence of aquatic life, and the weather conditions.
    In general, lake water can have a lower or higher pH level than tap water, depending
    on the lake''s distinctive characteristics and the way the local area''s tap water
    is treated. For instance, tap water is usually treated to have a pH level between
    6.5 and 8.5, which is considered safe for human consumption and does not cause
    corrosion in pipes. The naturally occurring presence of suspended particles like
    silt, sand, and algae in lake water can cause it to have a greater turbidity level
    than tap water. 2 Literature Review The hardware design of one system [1] includes
    various components such as sensors, actuators, relays, an Ethernet shield, Arduino,
    and routers. The monitoring of temperature and humidity is accomplished using
    an Arduino microcontroller, an Ethernet Shield, an FC-28 humidity sensor, and
    a DHT11 temperature sensor. A router is utilized to connect the Arduino Ethernet
    to a server. The relay module functions as a control switch for various actuators,
    which respond to the sensor output. The aquaponic box contains several actuators,
    such as two 12V DC exhaust fans, a mist maker, a 5V DC fan, two LED Grow Light
    lamps, and a 12V DC pump [2]. Another system kept track of numerous environmental
    factors, and over time it would be able to control how the farm operated and create
    a fully automated system. Publishers (nodes), brokers (local servers), and subscribers
    (local servers) all communicated via the MQTT protocol, which allows for the use
    of any data type. Monitoring can also be done with the help of a GUI program,
    a communication network, and [3] wireless sensors. A graphical user interface
    is provided by AWSM to address the aforementioned issues. Farmers can get real-time
    notifications and advice about water quality even when they are not there by using
    AWSM''s mobile applications built on IoT technology. When compared to the conventional
    approach, the introduction of the AWSM-based IoT application in the Aquaponics
    system has shown substantial gains. Additionally, it is feasible to [4] investigate
    many characteristics observed by smart systems, IoT technologies, and aquaponics.
    A ZigBee module [5] can be used in place of the Wi-Fi module to broadcast the
    data gathered by the Arduino while also displaying the values on the LCD without
    performing any control actions. A fish tank, a grow bed, and a light panel that
    simulates the sun''s rays for plant growth make up the aquaponics system described
    in [6]. The fish waste provides nutrients to the plants, which in turn receive
    water from the fish tank as a filter. The system makes use of actuators to operate
    the water pump, light panel, heater, and oxygen provider as well as sensors to
    monitor and control pH levels, temperature, and humidity. To direct the actual
    citrus production process, nutrient monitoring [7] in citrus plants can also be
    done in real time according to the soil situation. Another method that primarily
    focuses on finding magnesium and nitrogen deficiencies in image processing [8]
    in MATLAB for the detection of rice illnesses and nutritional deficiencies. A
    Raspberry Pi, a DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor, and solenoid valves make
    up the hardware employed in this technique. A deep learning method can help in
    the detection of diseases and the prediction of crop growth by utilizing many
    sensors that measure the pH value, temperature, humidity, and water level [9].
    Astute farming is described by the author of reference [10] as the integration
    of a wireless sensor and irrigation system that keeps track of factors including
    soil moisture, nutritional content, and pH levels. A GSM module is used to manage
    the system via wireless communication. 3 Architecture Diagram The proposed system
    shown in Fig 1 comprises two sets of sensors—one for the fish tank and the other
    for the crop soil. The data from these sensors are sent to the Arduino board.
    The Arduino board processes the data and sends it to the NodeMCU Wi-Fi module
    which sends it to the Adafruit cloud platform for visualization and analytics
    [11,12,13,14,15]. The system gathers real-time sensor data from the fish tank
    and crop soil using a variety of sensors, including a soil moisture sensor, temperature
    and humidity sensor, pH sensor, turbidity sensor, and water temperature sensor.
    The physical layer or sensor is made up of this. The data is gathered and transferred
    to the Arduino board regularly. Fig. 1 Architecture diagram of proposed system
    Full size image 4 Methodology The construction of an aquaponics monitoring system
    for effective irrigation is the main goal of the suggested system. The system
    uses a variety of sensors, including a soil moisture sensor placed in a tomato
    plant, pH, water temperature, and turbidity sensors. The irrigation process is
    controlled by the readings from these sensors. Hardware Setup: The hardware setup
    consists of an Arduino board that, via Arduino programming in the Arduino IDE,
    receives data from the sensors. The NodeMCU Wi-Fi module, which is set up to work
    on any internet network, receives the data after that. A personal hotspot or local
    Wi-Fi network was used for this project. The data is sent from the NodeMCU to
    Adafruit.io, a cloud-based platform for IoT data analytics and visualization.
    On this platform, real-time data changes can be tracked and examined. Every 30–45
    s, the sensors update their readings. A CSV file containing the data gathered
    from the Adafruit.io platform can be downloaded. Then, using the downloaded data,
    three classification algorithms—KNN, ANN, and Naive Bayes—are trained and tested.
    To forecast the soil''s irrigation needs, data is analyzed. Jupyter Notebook is
    used to analyze and visualize machine learning. Utilizing visualization techniques,
    the three classification systems are compared for accuracy. The system’s overall
    goal is to create an aquaponics monitoring system that controls irrigation by
    using a variety of sensors. Machine learning algorithms are used to analyze the
    sensor data and estimate the need for irrigation, which can result in more effective
    irrigation and higher agricultural yields. 4.1 Machine Learning Algorithms Used
    KNN (K-Nearest Neighbor). To use KNN, we must first select a value for k, which
    specifies the number of neighbors to take into account. Then, when we have a fresh
    batch of data to categorize, we determine how far away each point in the training
    set is from the fresh data and select the k-nearest points. Finally, we designate
    the class for the new data point as being the one that is most prevalent among
    those k points. Naïve Bayes’ classifier. Based on the Bayes theorem, which quantifies
    the likelihood of a hypothesis given evidence, it is a probabilistic categorization
    model. The term “naive” refers to the assumption made in Naive Bayes that the
    features are conditionally independent of the class. ANN (Artificial Neural Network).
    It is a machine learning model that takes its cues from how the human brain is
    organized and works. It is made up of many interconnected layers of neurons that
    analyze data and produce predictions. The features of the instance to be classified
    are sent to the input layer of an ANN classification model, and the predicted
    class is generated by the output layer. There are one or more hidden layers in
    between that process the input and transmit data to the output layer. The weighted
    total of the inputs is applied by each neuron in the hidden layers using a nonlinear
    activation function. 5 Components Used 5.1 Hardware The proposed irrigation system
    based on aquaponics uses various components to measure and transmit real-time
    data to the cloud platform for visualization and analytics. The sensors used in
    the system are summarized below. Soil moisture sensor (LM393). An electrical tool
    called the soil moisture sensor (LM393) measures the amount of water in the soil.
    It measures the soil moisture using the LM393 comparator integrated circuit and
    outputs a digital signal based on the predetermined moisture threshold. This sensor
    comprises two probes that are put into the soil; as a function of the moisture
    content of the soil, the resistance between the probe changes. Temperature and
    humidity sensor (DHT11). A widely used electrical device that can detect both
    temperature and humidity levels in the environment is the DHT11 temperature and
    humidity sensor. It uses a capacitive humidity sensor to monitor humidity levels
    and a Negative Temperature Coefficient (NTC) thermistor to measure temperature.
    The sensor sends digital outputs of temperature and humidity data to an 8-bit
    microcontroller through a one-wire protocol. pH sensor and turbidity sensor: A
    pH sensor is an electronic device that determines whether a solution is acidic
    or alkaline. The pH scale, which has a range of 0–14 with 0 being the most acidic,
    14 being the most alkaline, and 7 being neutral, serves as the basis for how it
    functions. The fish tank’s water clarity, which is crucial for fish health, is
    measured by the turbidity sensor. Water temperature sensor. A common sensor for
    measuring the temperature of liquids, including water, is the DS18B20. This sensor
    is a digital thermometer that communicates with other devices via a 1-Wire interface.
    With an accuracy of 0.5 °C in the range of − 10 to + 85 °C, the DS18B20 can measure
    temperatures from − 55 to + 125 °C. Arduino board. Arduino Uno is based on the
    ATmega328P microcontroller. It is an open-source hardware board created for people
    of all skill levels who want to develop a variety of electronic projects. The
    board contains a USB port, a power jack, six analog inputs, an ICSP header, and
    14 digital input/output pins. The Arduino programming language, which is based
    on C/C++, can be used to program the board. NodeMCU Wi-Fi module. The board is
    a great option for IoT applications because it combines the capabilities of a
    microcontroller and a Wi-Fi module. The Arduino IDE or the Lua programming language
    is used to creating programs for the NodeMCU ESP8266 device. Various sensors,
    actuators, and other electronic devices can be connected to the board''s GPIO
    pins. Additionally, it has Wi-Fi connectivity functionality built-in, enabling
    it to connect to the internet and communicate with other devices. A USB cable
    or an external power source can be used to power the board. 6 Implementation The
    sensor data was collected for over a month on an hourly basis. Visualizations
    were created based on the data. The data was also collected in the form of CSV,
    and three different binary classification algorithms were applied to it, namely
    KNN, ANN, and Naive Bayes. The working model of the aquaponic system is shown
    in Fig. 2. Fig. 2 Turbidity, water temperature, and pH sensor along with connections

    effective aquaponic irrigation management. Real-time sensor data visualization
    and analytics offer insightful information on fish and agricultural growth conditions.
    The three machine learning methods’ comparison offers useful insights into effective
    irrigation prediction in aquaponics. For visualization and analysis, the Adafruit
    platform can be accessed on a smartphone, laptop, tablet, or any other electronic
    device that can be connected to the internet. Visualization on Adafruit.io is

    7.1 Comparing the Accuracy of Various Classification Models The selection of a
    classification algorithm for agricultural data is influenced by the details of
    the data, the resources at hand, and the objectives of the classification activity.
    A standard criterion for assessing a classification model''s performance is accuracy.
    It calculates the percentage of cases in the dataset that were correctly categorized.
    To put it another way, accuracy is the proportion of true positives and true negatives
    in all instances. The model is operating effectively and properly predicting the
    class labels of the instances in the dataset when the accuracy value is high.
    A classification model could be taught to determine whether or not a certain soil
    sample needs irrigation based on its characteristics, such as its temperature,
    humidity, and soil moisture content. In this situation, a classification model
    with high accuracy might be helpful since it can make precise predictions about
    the soil samples’ irrigation requirements. As a result, farmers may be better
    able to decide when and how much to irrigate their crops, which may result in
    the more effective use of water resources and higher crop yields. On comparing
    the accuracy of all three algorithms as in Fig. 5, Naive Bayes was observed to
    have the highest accuracy of 94.12%. This is followed by ANN with an accuracy
    of 91.18% and then by KNN having an accuracy of 88.24. Fig. 5 Grouped bar chart
    for comparison of the accuracy of different models used Full size image 8 Conclusion
    In conclusion, we have presented an irrigation system based on aquaponics that
    utilizes real-time sensor data to monitor and irrigate crops efficiently. The
    system gathers information from a variety of sensors, including soil moisture
    sensors, temperature and humidity sensors, pH sensors, turbidity sensors, and
    water temperature sensors. This information is then processed and instantly displayed
    on the Adafruit platform. Furthermore, we evaluated the performance of three classification
    algorithms, namely KNN, Naive Bayes’, and ANN, for deciding when to irrigate the
    soil. We discovered that ANN had the maximum accuracy, making it the best algorithm
    for our system''s irrigation timing prediction. As a future scope, we plan to
    further enhance our system by incorporating features that will enable the user
    to receive alerts on their mobile device, indicating when the crop needs water.
    We also plan to compare our results with additional classification algorithms
    to identify the best-performing algorithm for our system. Overall, this system
    provides a significant advancement in the automation of aquaponics-based irrigation,
    offering a more efficient, accurate, and sustainable way of managing crops. References

    Wireless fidelity 1. Introduction 1.1. Agriculture - Population, Climate Change,
    Sustainability, and Globale market size Agriculture was one of humanity''s first
    endeavors, and it remains a mainstay of our civilization. It has changed greatly
    throughout time in order to fulfill the needs of an expanding global population,
    adjust to shifting climatic circumstances, and solve sustainability-related issues.
    The relationship between agriculture and important variables including population
    dynamics, climate change, sustainability, and the size of the global market has
    had a significant impact on the agricultural landscape. The agricultural sector
    needs to provide enough food to cope with the world''s ever-increasing population.
    Innovative agricultural technologies, such as advanced technologies and crop management
    systems, are needed to increase productivit. Due to the high population growth,
    the globe will need to produce more than 70 % of food by 2050 [1]. Moreover, agriculture
    is also at the forefront of the fight against climate change. Agricultural yields
    and livestock are under serious threat from the effects of global warming, manifested
    in variable weather patterns, high temperatures, and changing levels of precipitation.
    Farmers are increasingly exposed to the risks of climate change, which requires
    rigorous strategies to mitigate the effects of climate change in order to maintain
    agricultural productivity [2], [3]. It has become crucial to strike a balance
    between the need to produce food and the need to safeguard the environment and
    conserve natural resources. Sustainable agricultural methods are becoming increasingly
    popular as they promote ecological stability and resilience. According to Dhanaraju
    et al. (2022) [4] sustainable agriculture is a farming technique that tries to
    satisfy the needs of the present generation without jeopardizing the ability of
    future generations to satisfy their own needs. It focuses on reducing the negative
    environmental consequences of agriculture while ensuring that farmers can maintain
    their livelihoods and provide healthful food. It may boost the economy of nearby
    towns and farms, support regional food systems, promote rural development, and
    provide jobs for rural areas [5]. Overall, sustainable agriculture is a vital
    method of farming that may assist to ensure future generations have access to
    food and a healthy environment [6], [7], [8]. In parallel, the interconnectedness
    of the agricultural industry worldwide makes international trade in goods and
    commodities possible. To make wise choices and improve the allocation of resources
    among farmers and agri-food businesses, we need to understand market size, demand
    trends, and trade dynamics. Additionally, in the upcoming years, the value of
    the worldwide smart agriculture market will significantly rise.The rising need
    for food, the requirement for sustainable farming methods, and the adoption of
    cutting-edge technology in the agriculture field are all factors contributing
    to the market''s expansion [9], [10]. 1.2. Application of IoT, Blockchain, Embedded
    electronics, Robotics, and Automation in smart agriculture The rapid development
    of technology in recent years has paved the way for creative solutions in a variety
    of industries, and agriculture is no exception. Modern farming practices have
    been changed by the integration of the latest technologies, such as the IoT, robotics,
    blockchain, embedded electronics, and automation, giving rise to the idea of smart
    farming. This new paradigm involves the intelligent application of data-driven
    technology to improve the productivity, efficiency, and sustainability of agricultural
    methods. Smart agriculture will require the integration of new technologies like
    the IoT in order to gain a substantial competitive advantage. To meet the demands
    of the growing population, agricultural output must be raised [11], [12]. IoT
    is improving farming methods by providing connectivity and intelligence through
    automated irrigation systems and intelligent livestock monitoring. So that the
    agricultural sector will benefit from important advantages such as improving operational
    efficiency, reducing cost and waste, and improving crop quality thanks to intelligent
    agriculture based on the blockchain and IoT [13], [14], [15]. The agricultural
    supply chain is transparent and traceable thanks to blockchain technology. Immutable
    records boost consumer and stakeholder confidence by confirming the provenance
    of products and facilitating interactions between farmers and buyers. Smart agriculture
    also has a connection to the utilization of digital technologies, including embedded
    electronics, robotics, and automation [16], [17], [18], [19], [20]. Embedded electronics
    are crucial for smart agricultural equipment and gadgets. IoT is reinforced by
    robotics, which automates operations such as planting and harvesting to increase
    production and reduce manual labor. Automation driven by real-time data improves
    yields and optimizes the use of resources while reducing errors in farming practices.
    This technology seeks to simplify operations and improve productivity and decision-making.
    An agricultural control system known as “smart farming” offers a thorough approach
    to dealing with the geographical and temporal variability of soils and crops in
    order to enhance product quality, and boost profitability [21], [22]. 1.3. Application
    of sensors in smart agriculture and focus of this work Through the use of real-time
    data in smart agriculture, made possible by sensor technology, agricultural yields
    can be increased, costs can be cut, and there is less environmental harm. By acquiring
    data on a range of environmental factors, including nutrients, soil moisture,
    temperature, and others, farmers may make decisions about irrigation, fertilization,
    and pest control [23], [24]. Thanks to smart agriculture, farmers can continuously
    monitor crop growth and environmental conditions, anticipate potential problems,
    and take quick action in reaction to changes. This approach, which promotes efficient
    and environmentally friendly farming methods, is essential in light of climate
    change and other environmental problems. The application of sensor technology
    in agriculture is anticipated to have a substantial influence on future food production
    [25]. Every element of conventional agricultural operations has been significantly
    improved by the integration of cutting-edge sensors and IoT technology. Currently,
    smart agriculture has the potential to advance agriculture to previously unthinkable
    levels by seamlessly integrating wireless sensors and the IoT [26], [27], [28].
    In order to promote sustainable agriculture, this survey article focuses on cutting-edge
    IoT and sensor applications in smart agriculture. The study also focuses on the
    IoT architecture for smart agriculture as well as the size of the worldwide market
    for smart agriculture in the next years. 1.4. Preceding affined review papers

    to enhance farming operations [46], [47], [48]. Farmers may increase efficiency,
    production, and sustainability by utilizing IoT technology, which will enhance
    food security and make the agriculture industry more sustainable. 3. IoT application
    in smart agriculture The IoT has made smart agriculture, which is the most significant
    area for innovation in contemporary agriculture, conceivable. The combination
    of sensors, IoT, and data analytics technologies allows for real-time monitoring
    and management of farming activities, which helps to maximize resource utilization
    and increase crop yields. This section examines some of the most important IoT
    applications in smart agriculture, with a particular emphasis on 1) irrigation
    monitoring systems, 2) fertilizer administration, 3) crop disease detection, 4)
    monitoring (yield monitoring, quality monitoring, processing monitoring), forecasting,
    and harvesting, 5) climate conditions monitoring, and 6) fire detection. IoT technology
    has the potential to change the farming sector through these applications, fostering
    more effective, and sustainable agricultural methods. 3.1. Irrigation monitoring
    system smart irrigation based on IoT is a cutting-edge technology that automates
    and improves irrigation systems by harnessing the power of the IoT. This system
    reduces waste and conserves water resources while ensuring that gardens, lawns,
    and crops receive the proper quantity of water. Sensors, controls, and cloud-based
    software are used in smart irrigation systems to gather real-time data on plant
    water needs, weather, and soil moisture. Using this knowledge, irrigation plans,
    water flow rates, and other variables are modified to ensure that plants receive
    enough water when required [49], [50], [51], [45], [52], [53], [54]. These systems
    may be used in a variety of contexts, including landscaping for homes and businesses,
    golf courses, and agriculture. Reduced water waste, enhanced plant health, higher
    efficiency, and cheaper costs are all advantages of smart irrigation systems [55],
    [56]. By doing away with manual watering, users of smart irrigation systems may
    save time and money. They are the best option for anybody looking to install a
    more ecologically friendly and economical irrigation system since they allow users
    to preserve water resources while enhancing plant health and production [57],
    [58], [59], [60]. 3.2. Fertilizer administration Administration of fertilizers
    based in the realm of smart agriculture, IoT is a crucial application that makes
    use of IoT technology to maximize the usage of fertilizers. With the help of this
    application, farmers will be able to get up-to-the-minute information on the state
    of their soil and its nutrient content, which they can use to modify how much
    and what kind of fertilizer they apply to their crops [61], [63], [65], [67].
    Employing a variety of sensors, like the NPK sensors, temperature sensors, soil
    moisture sensors, and humidity sensors, farmers can determine when and how much
    fertilizer is required for their crops, resulting in more efficient and effective
    crop growth and development [62], [64]. Increased agricultural yields are one
    of the main benifits of IoT-enabled fertilizer administration [65]. Farmers may
    optimize the usage of fertilizers, which can result in better crop growth and
    development, by employing IoT sensors to monitor soil conditions and nutrient
    levels [63], [66]. For instance, NPK sensors may help farmers determine the right
    amount of nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium needed for their crops [62], [64],
    [67], [69]. These nutrients are crucial for plant growth [62]. Farmers may change
    the type and amount of fertilizer applied by using real-time data on nutrient
    levels, which increases crop yields and improves crop quality [62], [63], [68].
    The decrease in fertilizer waste and associated costs is another advantage of
    IoT-based fertilizer management. IoT-based fertilizer administration can increase
    fertilizer application accuracy and precision in addition to optimizing fertilizer
    consumption and cutting waste [61], [62], [63], [70]. Overall, IoT-based fertilizer
    administration is a critical smart agricultural application that may support more
    productive and efficient farming methods. This technology lets farmers to utilize
    fertilizers more intelligently by giving them real-time data on nutrient levels
    and soil conditions. Higher agricultural yields, improved crop quality, and less
    environmental impact are the outcomes of this. 3.3. Crop diseases detection Controlling
    crop diseases is an essential part of contemporary agriculture. Illnesses may
    drastically lower agricultural production, costing farmers money and jeopardizing
    the world''s food supply [71]. The overuse of pesticides and other chemicals can
    also have negative environmental impacts, such as polluting water supplies and
    upsetting natural ecosystems [72]. Fortunately, improvements in IoT technology
    are opening up fresh possibilities to tackle these problems. In the field, IoT
    and sensors may be used to monitor crop health in real-time and spot early symptoms
    of disease or insect infestation. These sensors may gather information on a variety
    of environmental and biological elements, including temperature, humidity, soil
    moisture, and plant development patterns, that have an impact on crop health [73],
    [74], [75], [76], [77]. The prevention of disease propagation and the reduction
    of pests'' negative effects on crop yields are made possible by the use of sensors
    and IoT in agricultural disease and pest control [76], [78], [79]. Additionally,
    IoT technology supports data-driven decision-making for pest and agricultural
    disease management [73]. By analyzing data received from sensors and other sources,
    farmers may learn about the effectiveness of their pest management strategies
    and make adjustments to their operations. By evaluating the data produced by IoT
    and sensors using ML and other data analytics technologies, farmers may identify
    patterns and trends in crop health and choose efficient pest management strategies
    [73], [80]. In terms of intelligent agriculture, the application of IoT and sensors
    for pest management marks a significant achievement. IoT technology provides more
    precise and sustainable pest management procedures, minimizing the use of toxic
    chemicals and fostering a more effective and environmentally friendly agriculture
    sector by giving farmers real-time data on crop health and insect activity. 3.4.
    Monitoring, forecasting and harvesting Yield monitoring, quality monitoring, processing
    monitoring, logistics monitoring, forecasting and harvesting are crucial aspects
    of smart farming that are increasingly using IoT technology to their advantage..
    In the field, IoT and sensors may be used to gather information on a variety of
    elements that influence agricultural yields, including temperature, humidity,
    soil moisture, and plant development patterns [61]. In order to estimate future
    harvests and get real-time insights on agricultural yields, this data may then
    be evaluated using new technologies [81], [82], [83], [84]. Real-time agricultural
    yield monitoring enables farmers to spot failing farms and make necessary adjustments
    to increase yields. IoT sensors may also offer information on the efficacy of
    various farming techniques, enabling farmers to adjust their plans for optimal
    output. The use of IoT in smart agriculture has the potential to transform the
    sector and solve pressing problems. IoT may have a significant positive impact
    in several crucial areas, including quality, processing, and logistical monitoring,
    predicting, and harvesting. Product compliance is ensured through quality control,
    while IoT sensors assist improve elements like soil condition. IoT-powered cameras
    are used for processing monitoring to guarantee constant product quality. Transportation
    efficiency is improved by using IoT devices like trackers for logistic monitoring.
    Another area where IoT technology might be quite helpful in crop forecasting[85].
    Farmers may employ machine learning algorithms to anticipate future harvests by
    examining previous data on crop yields and climatic variables. IoT and sensors
    may be utilized to increase productivity and reduce waste during the harvesting
    process [81], [83], [84]. In general, smart agriculture has advanced significantly
    with the use of IoT technologies for Yield monitoring, quality monitoring, processing
    monitoring, logistics monitoring, forecasting, and harvesting. IoT technology
    provides more efficient and effective agricultural methods, leading to better
    yields, decreased waste, and increased sustainability by giving farmers real-time
    data on crop yields and anticipated harvests. 3.5. Climate conditions monitoring
    Smart farming is greatly impacted by the weather. Due to climate changes, agricultural
    produce''s quality and quantity may be impacted. Alternatively, farmers may place
    sensors like water level, humidity, and temperature sensors in the sector using
    the IoT as a way to gather real-time environmental data [86], [87], [88], [89].
    In contemporary agriculture, it is normal practice to utilize sensors to keep
    an eye on the health of crops and the environment in which they are growing. These
    sensors are essential for capturing real-time data, giving farmers insightful
    information, and assisting them in making decisions regarding their agricultural
    methods [86]. When a potentially hazardous environmental problem is discovered,
    it is either automatically fixed or a notice is provided to the farmer advising
    them to act quickly to avoid agricultural losses [88], [90]. 3.6. Fire detection
    Fire detection is a significant IoT application in smart agriculture. Farmers
    may employ IoT devices to monitor potential fire dangers in their crops and forests
    [91], [92], [97]. These sensors are able to detect changes in flame as well as
    the presence of smoke and other fire-related indicators [93], [94], [95], [96],
    [98], [99], [100], [101]. The IoT system may warn the farmer and/or the neighborhood
    fire department if a fire is found, enabling them to act immediately and stop
    the fire from spreading. IoT fire detection systems can monitor controlled burns,
    which are frequently used in agriculture to manage land and encourage new development,
    in addition to preventing fires from starting in the first place. These fires
    may be carried out safely and successfully by using IoT sensors to monitor the
    smoke and other parameters [93], [94]. In general, adding fire detection to IoT
    systems in smart agriculture may aid farmers in safeguarding their land, crops,
    and animals as well as avoiding harm to neighboring populations and natural resources
    [92]. 4. Sensors for smart agriculture The way we grow our food might be completely
    changed by the introduction of the IoT and sensors in the agricultural sector.
    With the use of these technologies, farmers can gather and evaluate data in real-time
    on a range of environmental elements that impact crops, including temperature,
    wind speed, soil moisture, smoke, flame, etc. Farmers can monitor the health of
    their crops, spot fields that require more attention, and decide when to sow,
    irrigate, fertilize, and harvest their crops by employing smart agriculture sensors.
    As a result, there may be more production and efficiency, less waste, and less
    negative environmental effect. For instance, farmers may plan when to irrigate
    their crops using soil moisture monitors, only applying water when it is required.
    In addition to saving water and money, this can avoid overwatering, which can
    cause soil erosion and nutrient depletion. Similarly to this, farmers may employ
    targeted treatments just where they are required by utilizing sensors to track
    soil quality and nutrient levels. This reduces the need for pesticides and fertilizers
    while supporting sustainable agricultural methods. The majority of sensors widely
    used in smart agriculture are shown in Table. 2 name of sensors in column 1, sensor
    application type of data collect and description in column 2. Finaly type of data
    collect and description in column 3. Table 2. Agricultural sensors: Sensor application,
    type of data collecting and description. Sensor name Sensor application Type of
    data collect and description Soil NPK Sensor Fertilizer Administration. Determines
    the concentration of potassium, phosphorus, and nitrogen in the soil to aid in
    fertilization. Using soil NPK sensors to track changes in soil nutrient levels
    over time, growers may adjust fertilizer application rates and timing. The application
    of soil NPK sensors can reduce fertilizer waste, enhance crop productivity and
    quality, and prevent nutrient runoff into nearby rivers [66]. Soil Moisture Sensor
    Irrigation Monitoring Systems, Forecasting and Harvesting. Measures the amount
    of water in the soil to determine when and how much to irrigate. These sensors
    may be positioned at various soil depths to monitor the water availability at
    varying depths. Soil moisture sensors can aid in crop growth optimization, water
    conservation, and avoiding overwatering, which can result in nutrient loss and
    soil erosion [19], [102]. Nitrate Sensor Fertilizer Administration, Crop Disease
    Detection. Determines the nitrate content of the soil to aid in fertilizer application.
    Growers may alter fertilizer application rates and timing by using nitrate sensors
    to monitor changes in soil nitrogen levels over time. In addition to improving
    crop output and quality, nitrate sensors can assist minimize nitrogen runoff into
    surrounding waterways and decrease fertilizer waste [67], [104]. Soil pH Sensor
    Fertilizer Administration, Crop Disease Detection. Determines the soil''s pH level,
    which can aid in enhancing plant nutrient absorption. Growers may modify soil
    amendments and fertilizer application rates by using soil pH sensors to monitor
    variations in soil acidity over time. The use of soil pH sensors can improve crop
    production and quality, reduce nutrient deficits and toxicities, and stop soil
    acidification over time [104]. Electrical Conductivity Sensor Fertilizer Administration,
    Quality Monitoring. Determines the electrical conductivity of water or soil, which
    may be used to check salt and nutrient levels. Adjusting irrigation procedures
    and preventing salt accumulation in soils may both be accomplished with electrical
    conductivity sensors [105]. CO2 Sensor Quality Monitoring, Processing Monitoring,
    Climate Conditions Monitoring. Measures the quantity of carbon dioxide in the
    air, which may be used to keep track of plant development and respiration. Growing
    conditions may be improved by adjusting ventilation and lighting systems, which
    can be done with the use of CO2 sensors, which can track changes in CO2 levels
    over time. By adjusting ventilation and illumination as necessary, CO2 sensors
    can assist minimize CO2 buildup, which can result in decreased plant growth and
    productivity. They can also aid in lowering energy use [98]. Temperature and Humidity
    Sensor Irrigation Monitoring Systems, Quality Monitoring, Processing Monitoring,
    Forecasting and Harvesting, Climate Conditions Monitoring. Monitors environmental
    conditions by taking air temperature and humidity measurements. Extreme temperature
    ranges, high humidity levels, and other environmental variables that may affect
    plant growth and development may all be found with these sensors. Sensors for
    temperature and humidity can be placed in a variety of places, such as outside
    weather stations or within greenhouses. These sensors can aid in improving growth
    conditions, guarding against pests and disease, and lowering energy expenditures
    [98]. Sensor name Sensor application Type of data collect and description Light
    Sensor Quality Monitoring, Climate Conditions Monitoring. Measures the amount
    of light that plants receive, which can aid in maximizing growth and output. These
    sensors can measure the amount of light in different parts of a greenhouse or
    field and may be used to modify lighting or shade arrangements to improve growing
    conditions. By decreasing illumination or shading as necessary, light sensors
    may assist producers in producing high-quality crops with optimal yield and quality
    while also reducing energy use [106]. Weather Station Logistics Monitoring, Forecasting
    and Harvesting. Gathers information on the wind''s direction and speed, the amount
    of rain that has fallen, the barometric pressure, and other weather-related data
    that may be used by farmers to make choices about planting, harvesting, and other
    agricultural tasks. With the use of these sensors, producers can foresee weather-related
    hazards and improve crop management techniques by tracking weather trends over
    time. Weather stations can be set up on a farm or in a particular area and used
    to track regional weather patterns and microclimates [103]. Water Level Sensor
    Irrigation Monitoring Systems, Logistics Monitoring. The level of water in a tank,
    pond, or other body of water can be determined with a water level sensor. In order
    to monitor the water levels in irrigation systems and other bodies of water, water
    level sensors are frequently employed in agriculture [19]. Livestock Sensor Logistics
    Monitoring. Observes the health and conduct of cattle, which can aid in disease
    prevention and maximize output. Animal activity, body temperature, and eating
    habits may all be monitored with livestock sensors, among other parameters. These
    sensors can aid in improving feeding and breeding procedures, reducing animal
    stress, and promoting animal welfare [15]. Plant Disease Sensor Crop Disease Detection
    Analyzes plant tissue or soil samples to look for plant diseases. Plant disease
    sensors can be used to keep an eye out for illness in crops and assist producers
    in taking steps to stop its spread or potential harm [107]. Smoke Sensor Fire
    Detection The smoke sensor calculates how many smoke particles are present in
    the air at any one time, which may signal the existence of a fire. The sensor
    alerts the smart agricultural system when smoke particles are found so that it
    may take the necessary precautions to stop the fire from spreading [99], [100].
    Flame Sensor Fire Detection Using infrared light emission, the flame sensor locates
    fires. The sensor can recognize the infrared radiation that a flame releases when
    it is present. The sensor alerts the smart agricultural system when a flame is
    found so that it may take the necessary steps to stop the fire from spreading
    [99], [100]. Flexible sensor Yield Monitoring. An advanced, flexible, wearable
    sensor called the plant and food quality monitor was created specifically to track
    the quality of plants, fruits, and food. Real-time data collection is made possible
    by its soft and versatile shape, which makes it easy to install easily on the
    surface of various food items and plants without causing any damage [108]. In
    addition, as the world''s population continues to expand, IoT and smart agricultural
    sensors can assist farmers in meeting the rising food demand. Farmers may boost
    productivity while decreasing expenses and environmental effects by implementing
    these technologies. On the other hand, wave-based technologies are rapidly being
    used in industrial applications and smart sensors, due to their efficiency in
    analyzing and processing complex signals [109], [110], [111]. Together, these
    studies highlight the variety of applications for wavelet-based signal processing,
    from denoising and analysis in industrial environments to applications for smart
    sensors and machine learning. Given their versatility and efficiency in processing
    complex signals, wavelet methods are increasingly used in a variety of fields
    as useful tools for industrial processes and current sensor technology. Overall,
    the application of IoT and smart agriculture sensors in the agricultural business
    has the potential to alter the way we grow our food. These technologies can boost
    production and efficiency, and support sustainable farming methods by letting
    farmers gather and evaluate real-time data on numerous environmental conditions.
    This will be essential for supplying the world''s growing population with food
    in the future. 5. The benefits and challenge of IoT in agricultural 5.1. Benefits
    IoT application in agriculture, as in other sectors, provides previously unavailable
    efficiency, resource savings, cost, automation, and data-driven operations. IoT-enabled
    smart agriculture offers a number of noteworthy benefits, including superior efficiency,
    expansion, reduced resources, cleaner method, agility, and also product quality
    improvement. Numerous research papers have looked into the advantages of implementing
    the IoT in intelligent agriculture [30], [60], [112], [113]. As shown in Fig.
    6, the six benefits of the IoT in agriculture, we will discuss each benefit separately
    following: 1) Superior efficiency: Today''s agriculture is competitive. Farmers
    must produce more despite unfavorable soil conditions, diminishing land availability,
    and rising weather whims. Farmers can track their fields and environmental conditions
    in real-time thanks to IoT-based agriculture. They can generate ideas rapidly,
    foresee issues before they happen, and determine how to avoid them by employing
    information. IoT solutions for agriculture are also introducing automation, including
    irrigation, fertilization, automated harvesting, etc. 2) Expansion: By the next
    several years, there will be 9 billion people on the planet, with 70 % of them
    living in cities. Thanks to systems based on the IoT, especially systems that
    provide food supply chains, these people can be supplied with vegetables and fruits.
    It is now feasible to grow food practically everywhere, even on walls and roofs,
    in shipping containers, and inside everyone''s houses, thanks to intelligent closed-cycle
    farming systems. 3) Reduced resources: A lot of IoT solutions for agriculture
    are built to maximize the use of resources like electricity, water, and land.
    With the help of data gathered from numerous field sensors, IoT-based precision
    farming helps farmers to accurately distribute the proper quantity of resources.
    4) Cleaner method: Smart agriculture that supports the IoT is an effective way
    to reduce the use of fertilizers and pesticides. Intelligent farming helps farmers
    save water, energy, and the environment while drastically reducing the usage of
    pesticides and fertilizers. Compared to conventional agricultural methods, this
    technique enables the production of a cleaner end product to be produced. 5) Agility:
    IoT use in agriculture has the benefit of accelerating a number of processes.
    Farmers can quickly react to significant changes in weather, humidity levels,
    air quality, fires, and the state of specific crops and soil in the field thanks
    to real-time monitoring and forecasting systems. With the use of this technology,
    agricultural personnel may now save crops in the case of extreme weather or fires.
    6) Product quality improvement: The use of sensors and the IoT in agriculture
    improves and raises agricultural output. Crop sensors, drone-based overhead surveillance,
    and farm mapping are tools that farmers may use to better understand the intricate
    relationships between crop quality and the environment. They may duplicate ideal
    circumstances and improve the nutritional value of their crops by using linked
    systems.. Download : Download high-res image (233KB) Download : Download full-size

    few decades, there have been enormous technology improvements that have impacted
    our everyday lives. By placing resources at our fingertips, we are credited with
    improving the convenience of our lives. Smart sensors collect real-time data and
    establish connections with each other or the internet to initiate required actions.
    IoT has successfully captivated a vast audience due to the numerous ongoing innovations.
    However, the adoption of IoT technology brings both advantages and challenges.
    The difficulties of using the IoT in smart agriculture have been covered in several
    research [29], [30], [32], [114], [115], [116], [117]. Despite the IoT''s development
    over the past two decades, significant conceptual, structural, and problems remain.
    Fig. 7 depicts the most important challenges to implementing the IoT in agriculture,
    like 1) superior efficiency, 2) cost and standardization, 3) heterogeneity and
    accessibility, 4) adaptability and energy optimization, 5) compatibility and reliability,
    6) mobility and environmental conditions.Here are the most pressing immediate
    problems of the IoTs: 1) Superior efficiency: Agriculture is nowadays a race.
    Despite poor soil conditions, dwindling availability of land, and increased vagaries
    of weather, farmers must produce more. Farmers can monitor their products and
    environmental conditions in real-time thanks to IoT-based agriculture. They can
    quickly get ideas, anticipate problems before they arise, and decide how to prevent
    them from using knowledge. Automation is also being introduced by IoT solutions
    in agriculture, such as demand-based irrigation, fertilization, and automated
    harvesting. 2) Cost and Standardization: Due to regional economic disparities,
    creating a cost-effective strategy for IoT installations in agriculture is difficult.
    Economic models must be developed to control setup and operational expenses, which
    include the price of IoT devices, recurring subscriptions, data processing, maintenance,
    and energy. For devices, applications, systems, and products to function properly
    together, standardization is essential. Interoperability is challenging to achieve,
    though, because diverse IoT devices lack standardized formats and protocols. To
    enable the success of IoT implementations, interoperability is therefore required
    at the organizational, technological, semantic, and conceptual levels. 3) Heterogeneity
    and Accessibility: System design makes use of heterogeneous devices. Each gadget
    has a different set of operational and maintenance needs. Since the majority of
    models in agriculture use heterogeneous equipment, it is essential to create a
    connection between communication technologies and heterogeneous modules. The network
    becomes increasingly complex due to heterogeneity, which might occasionally result
    in the appearance of falsified results. Any IoT-based or other device-based farming
    decision support system must be built with the assumption that current software
    and hardware are always available everywhere. These problems must be fixed in
    order to ensure that services are available whenever and wherever they are needed.
    A lack of the required tools may result in chaos and service delays. 4) Adaptability
    and Energy Optimization: For smart farming, it is important that the devices are
    able to adapt to other devices in addition to the environment. Some hardware is
    incompatible with one another owing to the environment''s continually changing,
    as well as occasionally because of particular hardware or connection concerns.
    The most recent problem with communication devices, and other IoT is energy. Up
    until now, the designing and operating models have been supported by traditional
    sources of energy. However, with more gadgets on the market, using traditional
    energy is no longer a viable option. Aside from testing unconventional energy
    sources like solar, wind, and water energy harvesting plans, which haven''t had
    much success, new approaches also need to be developed. 5) Compatibility and reliability:
    The produced models or software should be adaptable and scalable in order to comply
    with the criteria of fragmentation and scalability. Reliability is a vital issue
    for IoT devices to effectively and seamlessly transmit data. The devices must
    collect and communicate accurate data since judgments are made utilizing the information
    that has been received and analyzed. Due to system failures, node failures, battery
    problems, and other interventions, reliability is still a difficulty. 6) Mobility
    and Environmental Conditions: The generated systems or models are often static.
    Because most devices and applications are portable, mobility is essential for
    the framework''s efficient implementation. The challenge of sustaining connectivity
    still exists in mobile models. Agricultural landscapes come in a variety. As a
    result, it becomes challenging to respond to those changes, which puts data and
    services at risk. This modifies a system''s accuracy. Download : Download high-res

    in agriculture. 6. Conclusion and perspective In conclusion, the Internet of Things
    (IoT) and sensor technology, then, provide significant potential for enhancing
    food security and sustainable agricultural methods. In addition to presenting
    four layers of the IoT architecture for smart agriculture, including the perception
    or sensing and actuator layer, the network layer, the cloud layer, and the application
    layer, this study also offers insights into the size of the global market for
    smart agriculture in the years 2021 to 2030. This review paper addressed the current
    state of IoT and sensor technologies for agriculture, as well as some of their
    potential applications, such as 1) irrigation monitoring systems, 2) fertilizer
    administration, 3) crop disease detection, 4) monitoring (yield monitoring, quality
    monitoring, processing monitoring, logistic monotoring), forecasting, and harvesting,
    5) climate conditions monitoring, and 6) fire detection. A variety of sensors
    for agriculture are also included in this study, including those that can detect
    soil NPK, moisture, nitrate, pH, electrical conductivity, CO2, temperature, humidity,
    light, weather station, water level, livestock, plant disease, smoke, flame, and
    flexible wearable. The advantages of IoT in smart agriculture are also highlighted,
    particularly in terms of of superior efficiency, expansion, reduced resources,
    cleaner method, agility, and product quality improvement. However, there are still
    problems that must be fixed before IoT technology can be employed in agriculture,
    which is what this study has discussed. further offer hints on potential future
    study avenues. Future readers and scholars will benefit from this study''s insights
    into the current status of academic accomplishment in this field. Agriculture
    has the potential to be revolutionized by the development and application of IoT
    and sensor technologies, enabling more sustainable and effective food production.
    The need for food will rise as the world''s population expands, and the agriculture
    industry must come up with novel solutions to fulfill this demand while preserving
    sustainability. IoT and sensors, which provide real-time monitoring and management
    of crops, soil, and environment, present a possible answer to these problems.
    However for them to be widely used and implemented, a lot of money must be spent
    on infrastructure, training, and research. To encourage the use of IoT and sensor
    technologies in agriculture and to address the difficulties facing the industry,
    governments, private sector players, and other stakeholders should work together
    to establish policies and strategies. The development of sustainable and effective
    agricultural techniques that can fulfill the requirements of a rising population
    while protecting the environment for future generations, as well as the successful
    integration of IoT and sensor technologies, are key to the future of smart agriculture.

    apps efficiencyActuators 1. Introduction One of the major challenges is to eliminate
    hunger and poverty while also ensuring the sustainability of agriculture and food
    systems. This can be accomplished by establishing integrated systems capable of
    achieving food security and sustainable development. Hydroponic and aeroponic
    systems are alternatives to traditiona1 agriculture that could be used effectively
    in Egypt to meet the country''s rapidly growing population. In comparison to conventional
    agriculture and other soilless methods, automation of hydroponic and aeroponic
    systems in smart greenhouses has demonstrated promising results in several countries
    and is advised as the most effective, economical, and suitable plant cultivation
    system. One of the most significant challenges facing protected agriculture is
    controlling the environment inside greenhouses. The traditional hydroponic and
    aeroponic agriculture systems are still waiting significant advancements in networking
    technology, especially in controlling the influencing factors inside the greenhouse.
    These challenges can be solved through continuous monitoring of the vital growth
    parameters, with a momentary measurement of all of these parameters. Intensive
    and extensive researches have been carried out to explore the development of smart
    technologies in agriculture field. Much effort has been expended to improve greenhouse
    systems: Sambo et al. [1] present a review of the literature on hydroponic greenhouse
    systems and smart technologies that can help them perform better. Fernandes et
    al. [2] developed a system to regulate the humidity and temperature of a greenhouse-based
    hydroponic system. However, the numerous plug-ins and software needed made system
    configuration challenging. Unfortunately, because it only offers cooling systems
    to control high temperatures, only summer crop production was intended to benefit
    from the system. Besides, the pH and nutrient solution concentration (EC) were
    not determined. As a result, the system will provide inaccurate information about
    pH and nutrient combination. Yamaguchi et al. [3] developed a closed, integrated
    hydroponic system that can support the growth of 10 heads of lettuce. They designed
    the system with adjustable lighting for use indoors or in a glasshouse. After
    28 days, the authors were ab1e to harvest the lettuce using the proposed system,
    but this system required manual intervention to work properly. A hydroponic greenhouse
    system was recently successfully constructed by Sihombing et al. [4], but this
    system has a disadvantage of measuring only the water level and the temperature
    of the nutrient solution. The authors of [5], [6] built a system that measures
    water leve1, pH, electrica1 conductivity, water temperature, and relative humidity.
    After the data was sent to a database, farmers were alerted to things like the
    imbalance of nutrients in the system. The sole purpose of the system is to observe
    the hydroponic setting. As a result, because the system lacks actuators, the farmer
    must control events. The prediction models type for lettuce quality from IoT-based
    hydroponic farms were created by Gartphol et al [7]. The authors built a smart
    hydroponic lettuce farm with real-time management of operations and environmental
    data collection. A large set of data was collected and regression models were
    created using machine learning algorithms. Due to errors like those found when
    measuring lettuce''s height due to variations brought on by blowing wind, the
    model was unable to produce a successful learning outcome. Also, an automated
    hydroponic system was created by Nalwade and Mote [8], that ensures the potential
    of hydrogen pH and EC of nutrients are measured automatically and maintained by
    the system before being transmitted to farmer via GSM. As there is no oversight
    of the nutrient level. This might result in the plant receiving a lot of nutrients.
    A Rasberry Pi3 and a Field Programmable Gate Array FPGA were used by the authors
    in [9], [10] to control and monitored water level, humidity, and temperature using
    a sizable model of IoT-based systems. The modularity of the system allows for
    simple maintenance. But the system relies on a server that might not always be
    reachable for communication. Furthermore, because growing plants have different
    requirements and consumption rates, a fixed might not be the best choice. Siregar
    et al. [11] suggested a closed greenhouse monitoring system with open garden shield
    and hydroponic system, Arduino Uno microcontroller, and different sensors as PH
    sensor, EC sensor, water and air temperature sensor, light sensor, and GSM/GPRS.
    The Arduino Uno receives the data from the sensors that the shie1d has collected
    and has sent it via I2C communication. Because the proposed system lacks actuators,
    it is reliant on the farmer to regulate the environment. According to Lakhiar
    et al. [12], the application of sophisticated monitoring technology tools in aeroponics
    may allow for remote monitoring and management of all system parameters. As a
    result, it may reduce system casualties caused by the time-consuming manual monitoring
    and regulating process. To better understand how various environmental and nutrient
    characteristics connect to plant growth, plant scientists may need a range of
    data that the approach provides. In contrast to conventional agriculture, aeroponics,
    hydroponics, and aquaponics systems reduce water loss and increase water usage
    efficiency, according to Ali Al Shrouf [13], who examined the key differences
    between three new agricultural systems and conventional farming methods. S.Ramakrishnam
    Raju et al. [14], implemented a smart hydroponics expert system that is based
    on artificial intelligence and operates in IoT environment to monitor and control
    various parameters. The results show that the proposed system performs better
    than expected in terms of accuracy. Doaa K. Hassan et al. [15], investigated the
    state of productive urban landscape practices used in gated communities. The hydroponic
    systems are as one of the main focus. Practitioners showed that Soilless/hydroponic
    culture could be a great value in such practices. Tarek Selim, Mohamed Galal Eltarabily
    [16], presented a study for decision-makers and small-scale farmers in Egypt.
    They discussed the sector of agriculture systems and the switch to smart irrigation
    systems in small farms. Charisma Aulia Jamhari, et al. [17], They created a hydroponic
    monitoring and automation system that can be observed using sensors linked to
    an Arduino microcontroller, a Wi-Fi module, and Mode1 B microcomputers operating
    as webservers. The results show that this method helps farmers increase the effectiveness
    and efficiency of monitoring and running hydroponic farms. Aeroponics did not
    use water as a growing medium, in contrast to hydroponics. The roots of the plant
    are submerged in water in a hydroponic system in order to collect nutrients and
    water for survival. When employing sprinklers or nozzles, aeroponics, on the other
    hand, delivers the nutrients to the plant''s roots in a mist spray [18]. A system
    for monitoring plant growth automatically has been installed. Rea1-time measured
    data are analysed and reviewed to maximise the benefits to water and land units.
    In this study, data from remote locations were monitored, gathered, and analysed
    using IoT technique. All facets of human life are significantly impacted by the
    Internet of Things. One option for effectively automating monitoring is to use
    Internet of Things (IoT)-based sensors [19]. It can be applied cooperatively to
    complete challenging tasks that call for high intelligence. IoT devices have integrated
    sensors, actuators, processors, transmitters, and receivers to support this intelligence
    and connectivity [20], [21]. The first layer in this study''s IoT architecture
    is the perception layer, which includes many sensors like those for temperature,
    humidity, illumination intensity, and TDS. The second layer is the transport layer,
    which uses wireless communication networks Wi-Fi was chosen for this study to
    transmit data from the perception layer to the processing layer and vice versa.
    While the processing layer is in charge of managing, storing, and processing vast
    amounts of data that are received from the transport layer. It''s important to
    note that the system was developed using cloud computing technology, which allows
    the system to monitor data on the internet and create a user-friendly web browser
    application. This could make the system quicker, more effective, real-time, affordable,
    and user-friendly. Thus, the developed system''s goal can be accomplished. The
    application layer, which sits at the bottom of the stack, houses an alert system
    and can inform the decision-maker of any systemic issues via alert messages. Delivering
    application-specific services is primarily the responsibility of the administrators
    who are allowed access to the developed website and mobile application. Hydroponic
    and aeroponics systems with smart IoT automated greenhouses were constructed in
    this study to support sustainable crop production development. The developed system''s
    ability to maximize the use of each unit of water, energy, and agricultural fertilizers
    to achieve the highest possible productivity from pesticide-free plants is what
    distinguishes it from competing systems. 2. Material and method 2.1. Deployment
    of smart greenhouse The system design and construction will be introduced in this
    section as shown in Fig. 1. The greenhouse was installed at 25 m2 greenhouse in
    Delta region, Egypt. It was constructed according to the system of interlocking
    arches. The metal skeleton is made of galvanized pipes. Arches and posts are 2
    in. in diameter and 1.8 mm in thickness. Arches and posts supporters are 1-inch
    diameter and 1.8 mm thickness. The Supporters carry 2D camera to be moved freely
    in both directions X and Y. The entire greenhouse was covered completely with
    plastic panels of 200 µm thickness which transmit the light highly. A fixed shading
    net has been installed on all lateral sides of the constructed greenhouse as shown
    in Fig. 1 (a). The smart greenhouse design (with hydroponic and aeroponic systems)
    is depicted in Fig. 1 (b). Furthermore, the aeroponic system tanks (1 and 2) and
    Pesticide and nutrient tanks shown in Fig. 1(c) and 1(d), respectively. Download

    Design and construction of smart greenhouse. 2.2. Deployment of hydroponic system
    greenhouse The constructed hydroponic system shown in Fig. 2 uses water nutrient-rich
    solution as a growing medium and offers vital nutrients for sustaining p1ant growth.
    It is carried out in the absence of any growing media. Two horizontally shaped
    hydroponic cultivation systems were built inside the greenhouse and installed
    on both sides of the greenhouse. PVC pipes with a diameter of 4 in. and a thickness
    of 4 mm were used in both systems. Each system is a network consisting of pipelines,
    timer, and nutrient solution and ends with a tank of 100 L capacity. Each tank
    is connected to a pump to transfer the nutrient solution to the pipelines to feed
    the plants. Then, the nutrient solution returns back to the tank to get benefit
    from it again. Details of each system are shown in Table 1. Download : Download

    greenhouse Two aeroponics systems were installed vertically inside the constructed
    greenhouse as shown in Fig. 3. Each system was built using PVC pipes of 10 in.
    diameter and 6 mm thickness. Each system contains ten vertical pipelines, a timer,
    and a tank for the nutrient solution. The tank is 500 L capacity and linked to
    a pump to transfer the nutrient solution to the irrigation network to supply the
    plants. As in a hydroponic system, the nutrient solution returns back to the tank
    using the drainage network. Table 2 indicates the details of constructed aeroponics

    control system IoT based smart greenhouse The goal of greenhouse automation, intelligence,
    and reliable data transmission can be accomplished by a smart control system for
    greenhouses based on IoT. This system can realize comprehensive perception, reliable
    transmission, and intelligent processing of greenhouse environmental parameters.
    The system''s primary components include sensors, microcontrollers, centralized
    computers, and actuators, as was already mentioned. The system parameters were
    intelligently automated, stored, and displayed via an IoT platform. A field control
    system is created by connecting sensors and actuators to a microcontroller. With
    only a small amount of user input, the built-in system can keep the plants'' growing
    conditions healthy. The greenhouse environment is controlled by a set of sensors
    and actuators that connected to real time measurement and alarm system. Temperature,
    humidity, lightening intensity and Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) are measured through
    monitoring sensors. Fig. 4 shows the developed IoT based Smart Greenhouse, in
    which the perception layer is the core and fundamental element of the Internet
    of Things in agriculture and irrigation. It perceives the microclimate environment
    information of the greenhouse comprehensively, provides an accurate, scientific,
    and thorough basis for automatic control and intelligent decision-making. Fig.

    developed system. When the sensors provide context information, it is transferred
    to the microcontroller, which is utilized to integrate all of the deployed devices''
    data on a single platform. The structural design is based on three major components
    that are needed to carry out various tasks. The first component, known as the
    physica1 layer, is divided into three sub-components: Sensors, actuators, and
    microcontrollers. Sensors, such as light and TDS sensors are in greenhouse, humidity/temperature
    sensors are in and out greenhouse. All sensors p1ay an important role in gathering
    information about the optimum values for plant growth. These sensory devices send
    the collected data to a microcontroller, which then makes a decision by interacting
    with the user remote1y via the internet. Actuators for greenhouse as a nutrient
    tank, a water pump, lights, fan, cool panel and windows. They are used to carry
    out the user''s command. Monitoring, which includes plant and climate monitoring,
    is the second major component of smart greenhouse. The appropriate observation
    is made by the devices in climate monitoring to balance the environment that is
    required for the crop that is cultivated within. IoT data acquisition is divided
    into two parts: standard data acquisition and IoT-based data acquisition. Wi-Fi
    communication protocol is a standard type. HTTP protocol is used for IoT data
    acquisition. This protocol is used to communicate over long distances. Furthermore,
    IoT-based data acquisition is used to maintain greenhouse conditions in order
    to increase the production rate of quality crops efficiently. Wi-Fi connectivity
    within the cloud enables data transmission to the cloud via a microcontroller
    and storage in a cloud-based database. The data saved in the cloud is repeatedly
    transmitted to the user''s mobile device via the internet to initiate a remote
    check using developed application by authors as shown in Fig. 6, allowing the
    user to change the threshold for the greenhouse climate. Download : Download high-res

    by authors to initiate a remote check (for alarm and control system). Depending
    on the threshold value for the temperature, the micro-controller activates the
    driver circuit of actuators for regulating the airflow and stabling the temperature.
    The temperature and humidity of the surrounding environment (out of the greenhouse)
    are measured to be periodically compared with the interior temperature and humidity
    of the greenhouse. Pesticides are sprayed inside the greenhouse using the pesticide
    spraying tank that connected to the fogging network. Furthermore, with the help
    of IoT environment and cloud computing, another facility to access data remotely
    from all over the world is provided. 3.1. Temperature The primary environmental
    factor that impacts how frequently plants grow and develop is temperature. The
    higher temperatures, the faster chemica1 processes proceed which deteriorate the
    enzyme activities. The cooling system inside the greenhouse operates using a cooling
    panel attached to a 0.5 HP pump. It pumps water from the cooling tank to the cooling
    panels to provide the required temperature inside the greenhouse. A heating system
    was set up in the greenhouse using oil heaters with a tota1 capacity of 3000 kW.
    The heating system keeps the greenhouse''s internal temperature suitable for cultivation
    during the winter or whenever the temperature decreases. A single fan has been
    installed to ensure uniform temperature distribution and air circulation within
    the greenhouse. The temperature and humidity sensor DHT11 and DHT22 in and out
    the greenhouse is a basic as shown in Fig. 7, low-cost, multipurpose digital sensor
    that monitors the temperature and relative humidity of the air around it using
    a negative temperature coefficient (NTC) thermistor and a capacitive sensor module.
    The sensor generates a digital signa1 at the output pin. It is suitab1e for readings
    with an accuracy of ± 0.5 °C and a sampling rate of no more than 0.5 Hz for temperatures
    between −40 and 125 °C (once every 2 s). Download : Download high-res image (163KB)

    and out the greenhouse. It was installed both inside and outside the greenhouse
    and measures the temperature on a regular basis. It is linked to the cooling pump,
    which sends signals to the cooling panel in Fig. 8 (a) to pump water, and the
    suction fan operates in parallel, as shown in Fig. 8(b). When the temperature
    falls, the sensor sends a signal to the heaters in Fig. 8(c) to raise the temperature
    to the desired level. Generally speaking, the growth environment''s temperature
    should range from 30 °C to 4 °C. However, the temperature in the greenhouse was
    adjusted between 20 and 35 °C. Download : Download high-res image (769KB) Download

    (fan, cooling panel and heaters) in the constructed IoT smart green house. 3.2.
    Humidity A sensor was installed to regularly maintain and contro1 the required
    humidity concentration inside the greenhouse based on plant needs. The high level
    of humidity is controlled by drying it using heaters and also, operating the suction
    fan to withdraw the air saturated with moisture particles. On the other hand,
    the decrement of the humidity levels is controlled by a fogging network. The fogging
    network consists of a tank as shown in Fig. 9 and a submersible pump with a power
    of 0.5 Hp to pump water to the network. The network also includes nine quadrilateral
    water sprinklers. Download : Download high-res image (272KB) Download : Download

    The illumination intensity 1000 LUX light-emitting diode LED headlamps are used
    to control the illumination intensity. Given that it promotes rapid photosynthesis
    and plant growth. In an aeroponics system, the LED is thought to be the best light
    source for plant growth. The NORP12 sensor is a photoconductive cell covered in
    a moisture-resistant coating and housed in a plastic casing. Its spectra1 response
    is similar to that of the human eye. Light sensor’s output vo1tage modification
    depends upon the intensity of light. It is worth mentioning that, the illumination
    intensity operate automatically as the plant needs the light absence at night.
    However, this was utilized in research to examine the dampening effect of illumination
    intensity on plant growth. 3.4. The Total dissolved solids (TDS) To ensure successful
    plant growth, the TDS value of the nutrient solution, where water and nutrient
    solution are repeatedly recycled, must be measured on a regular basis. A sensor
    placed in the nutrient tanks is used to regulate the TDS. TDS value is measured
    using TD1000-T sensor. It needs to be adjusted if the TDS are not at the right
    level. To increase the TDS in the Nutrient tank, the sensor sends a signal to
    a solenoid valve. The optimum pH of nutrients is 5.5–––6.5, which can be adjusted
    using pH up and pH down solutions, which are non-concentrated acids and bases.
    Total dissolved solids (TDS) recommendations range from 300 to 400 mg/l for seedlings
    and seeds, 500 to 600 mg/l for vegetative growth, and 700 to 900 mg/l for advanced
    vegetative growth [22], [23]. 4. Development of a dynamic website and mobile application
    The website that was created is dynamic as shown in Fig. 10. Web pages on dynamic
    websites are typically generated in rea1 time. When a user accesses a dynamic
    page, the data stored in the cloud is repeatedly transmitted to the developed
    PHP website and user''s mobile device through developed mobile application by
    authors via the internet to initiate a remote check as shown before in Fig. 6.
    Fig. 11 depicts the developed dynamic PHP website by authors. Fig. 12 shows the

    5.1. TDS comparative results Leafy Plants such as lettuce, Spanish, cabbage, and
    others were grown in the greenhouse''s developed hydroponic and aeroponic systems.
    The most significant influencing factor on the plantation is TDS. As mentioned,
    TDS is measured by a sensor connected to a control program. Besides, TDS in Nutrients
    tanks has been measured in the field periodically. The average resulting TDS from
    the control program and fie1d measurements are compared to the recommended levels
    of TDS during the different growth stages. This comparison ensures that the sensors
    accurately and efficiently send the correct signals to the rest of the control
    devices in the greenhouse to automatically provide the appropriate environment
    based on the growth stage. As mentioned before, the recommended TDS range between
    300 and 400 mg/1 during the seedlings and seeds stage, 500–600 mg/l during vegetative
    growth, and 700–900 mg/1 during advanced vegetative growth [22], [23]. As indicated
    in Fig. 13, Fig. 14, Fig. 15, the field measured TDS range between 280 and 400
    mg/l, 485–628 mg/l, and 710–913 mg/l for the three stages, respectively. Meanwhile,
    the TDS recorded by the program are 290––420 mg/l, 482–611 mg/l and 683–907 mg/l,
    correspondingly. Thus, the measured and recorded TDS are properly close; in addition,
    they fall within the recommended range for TDS during the different stages. Preliminary
    experiments showed promising results, as; the nutrients are absorbed quicker,
    allowing the plant to grow faster and healthier. Generally, hydroponic and aeroponic
    are media for crop cultivation grown in a controlled environment without soil
    where water and nutrient solution are repeatedly recycled, which allows for optimal
    plant growth and development. They are fed with nutrient-rich water solutions
    that contain all the necessary nutrients (major and minor nutrients) required
    for different plant growth stages. This method of cultivation allows for faster
    growth and higher yields compared to traditional soil-based farming. However,
    the nutritional value of hydroponic and aeroponic crops may differ from those
    grown in normal soil. In nutritional solutions, all elements (used for plant nutrition)
    are in equilibrium and in available form for plant. But in agricultural soils,
    the antagonism between some elements could lead to the precipitation of these
    elements in unavailable forms where the plant couldn’t absorb it. The nutrient
    content of plants is influenced by various factors such as the quality of the
    growing medium, the type of fertilizer used, and the environmental conditions.

    of 80–90% compared to conventiona1 agriculture. For example, Batavia lettuce was
    produced within a month and a half. 5.2. Humidity comparative results Humidity
    control is regarded as an important parameter for effective lettuce growth. Extreme
    humidity reduces transpiration, resulting in reduced nutrient transport. Therefore,
    a relative humidity (RH) of 70 to 80 percent is commonly targeted during lettuce
    growth whi1e reduce from 70 percent during yield. Fig. 16 depicts the RH data
    collected inside and outside the greenhouse. This figure shows that the RH in
    the greenhouse is optimal when compared to the RH outside the greenhouse because
    of the controlled system that allows the plants to evaporate enough water to allow
    the transport of minerals (like Ca) to growing plant cells. Fig. 17 explains how
    boxplots define data inside and outside the greenhouse. Download : Download high-res

    and Seeds Stage (controlling system). 5.3. Temperature comparative results One
    of the best qualities of this lettuce is its resistance to heat. Indeed, Batavia
    lettuce prefers warmth and germinates best at temperatures around 80°Fahrenheit
    as around 30 0c. Most other lettuces cannot germinate or survive in the temperatures
    that Batavia lettuce does. The only disadvantage is that you will have to plant
    these. Fig. 18, Fig. 19 show the temperature data record and boxplot inside and
    outside the greenhouse, respectively. This figure shows that the temperature in
    the greenhouse is optimal when compared to the temperature outside the greenhouse
    due to the controlled system that aids growth. Download : Download high-res image

    Water and energy consumption The amount of water and energy consumed must be monitored
    in order to reduce the overall operating costs of the developed system and to
    make the system power efficient and expandable on a large scale. In terms of water,
    the water consumption in developed system was monitored and recorded during the
    leafy seedling period and the vegetative growth period (45 days). 560 plants were
    used in the study period during April and May. The study period was divided into
    approximately 20 days as the leafy seedling period and 25 days as the vegetative
    growth period. For the leafy seedling period, it was found that the water needs
    per liter for 560 plants in 20 days was about 140 L/day approximately 3 m3, while
    the water needs during the vegetative growth period for 560 plants in 25 days
    was approximately 4 m3. So it was found that the total water consumed during the
    period of leafy seedling and vegetative growth is about 7 m3 for the total area
    (25 m2) in GH. Compared to traditional cultivation, the water use of lettuce was
    estimated at about 965 L per square meter per crop [24], which indicates the efficiency
    of the developed system. On the other hand, in terms of energy, the developed
    system''s power consumption should be monitored using a power meter, which is
    recommended as a future work. However, it should be noted that the use of IoT
    technology reduces the developed system''s power consumption. Since the actuators
    (such as pumps, oil heaters, etc.) on1y run for a short time when the microcontroller
    sends an alarm message, the overall power consumption for these actuators during
    the study period is very low. Taking into account the energy consumed by the oil
    heaters which are the most energy consuming system. They were not continuously
    worked on because the study period is in the summer, and thus their power consumption
    is negligible during the study period. 6. Challenges and limitations There are
    several challenges in the developed smart system such as high initial construction
    cost. Furthermore, the maintenance process of deve1oped system components. In
    addition to the need for qualified technicians to maintain any problem in the
    system, such as any defect in the drip irrigation system, blockage of sprinklers
    or defects in heaters or the cooling pane1, in order to avoid damage or low efficiency
    and productivity for yield. Hence these systems need frequently maintenance which
    requires a high cost. Also, the automation of harvesting in developed system with
    the help of IoT has not been explored. The manual harvesting method may lead to
    the infection of the younger crops with human beings as vectors. Furthermore,
    since the automated system can work tirelessly, it is more economical to use smart
    systems in the harvesting of the crops. In addition, there are some limitations
    that must be taken into account in the developed system, such as power outages,
    as the system will stop working immediately. Plants may quickly dry out and die,
    resulting in some crop loss. It''s crucial to have an alternative power source
    found automatically. Moreover, since the developed system is a closed, water-based
    system, diseases and pests can spread rapid1y as they share a single nutrient
    tank, requiring constant monitoring and treatment of pests. Growers a1so require
    skills and knowledge for commercia1 applications in order to maintain optimal
    production, also they need high marketing skills due to the high prices of system’s
    products. On the other hand, smart hydroponic and aeroponic farming methods are
    not currently feasible for growing strategic and staple crops as rice, wheat,
    and corn on a large scale. While these systems can be used to grow smaller grains
    such as barley, oats, and quinoa, the cost of implementing these systems for large-scale
    production of staple crops like rice, wheat, and corn is currently prohibitive.
    Rice, wheat, and corn are crops considered low value from the economical view
    point comparing to quinoa [25]. Therefore, such crops are planted in agricultural
    lands in Egypt, but in areas (all over the world) where the soil is in scarce,
    the smart aeroponic or hydroponic systems are recommended in such cases. Still,
    more advanced research needs to be conducted to answer the concerns of reduce
    the capital and operating costs for using these smart methods for this type of
    strategic and staple crops for Egypt. 7. Conclusion and future work This paper
    is aimed to introduce some possibilities for improvement of the hydroponic and
    aeroponics systems by utilization of IoT automated greenhouse. Smart architecture
    for the hydroponics and aeroponics greenhouse system was developed. The sensors
    were installed to regularly maintain and control the required humidity concentration
    and the temperature inside the greenhouse based on plant needs. This study evaluated
    the environmental and technical impacts of the developed smart system on the cultivation
    of Batavia lettuce with high economic value. Measured and recorded TDS were compared
    to the recommended values in the different growth stages. It gave accepted TDS
    ranges and approved the high efficiency and accuracy of the automated system.
    The nutrients are absorbed faster, allowing the plant to grow faster and healthier,
    according to preliminary experiments. In addition, when compared to conventional
    agriculture, the developed hydroponic and aeroponic systems using IoT saved 80–90
    percent of water and fertilizer. In addition to doubling productivity per area
    and reducing the time yield to reach 45 days comparing 75 days with the traditional
    agriculture whatever the fertility of the soil. Also, the resulted of Relative
    Humidity (RH), and Temperature (T) as in TDS was analyzed and evaluated during
    the cultivation period with and without the developed smart system, it can notice
    that the RH and T in greenhouse are optimum comparing with it out greenhouse as
    a result of smart controlled system. According to this system, it was found that
    the water use for 560 plants during the period of leafy seedling and vegetative
    growth period is about 7 m3 for total area in GH (25 m2). Compared to traditional
    cultivation, the water use of lettuce was estimated at about 965 L per square
    meter per crop [24], which indicates the efficiency of this system. In addition,
    it is considered the developed smart system are more efficient in terms of yield
    per area and water usage, normalized by yield, than conventional agriculture.
    Also, it can conclude that energy consumption can be mitigated by using cost-effective
    renewable energy sources as a future work. However, more experiments are needed
    and more characteristics of the hydroponics or aeroponics system should be considered.
    Regarding the developed system based on IoT where it provides automated monitoring
    and control of these systems. Also, it can be able to assess the environmental
    and technical effects of the advanced system thus improving water and energy efficiency,
    minimizing cost and saving labor, and reducing the use of fertilizers and pesticides.
    Overall, the cost comparison between smart hydroponic and aeroponic systems agriculture
    and traditional agriculture will depend on various factors such as the size of
    the farm, the type of crops grown, the local climate, labor costs, and market
    prices. It is important for farmers to carefully evaluate their options and consider
    all relevant factors before making a decision. In addition, future work will focus
    on finding alternative energy approaches such as a solar power system to power
    an automated greenhouse. As well, use desalinated water to feed hydroponics and
    aeroponics systems. Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that
    they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

    data recording; environmental footprint 1. Introduction The agrifood sector, a
    cornerstone of the global economy, sustains billions by providing food and livelihoods.
    Yet, it grapples with multifaceted challenges, from climate change and environmental
    degradation to population growth, food security, and consumer trust. Addressing
    these requires sustainable, efficient agricultural practices that optimize resource
    use, curtail waste, and elevate productivity and quality. The Internet of Things
    (IoT) is emerging at the forefront of solutions. This network of interconnected
    devices, equipped with sensors, actuators, and communication protocols, offers
    real-time monitoring and control over parameters like crop growth, soil health,
    water consumption, pest management, and greenhouse gas emissions. Beyond monitoring,
    IoT enhances traceability and transparency throughout the food supply chain, bolstering
    food safety and consumer trust. However, the integration of IoT in agriculture
    is not without challenges, especially concerning data management: Data Security:
    Ensuring data integrity and safeguarding against malicious tampering is paramount.
    Data Privacy: Stakeholders’ rights and preferences necessitate stringent measures
    against unauthorized data access or disclosure. Data Scalability: As farms grow
    and technology adoption surges, systems must accommodate an increasing influx
    of data from sensors and devices. Data Interoperability: Seamless data exchange
    is crucial, especially when devices and systems employ diverse formats and standards.
    Data Cost: Efficient data transmission and storage are vital, particularly for
    frequent or low-value transactions. Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) and
    the IoT can address these challenges by offering a decentralized, immutable, and
    transparent platform for data management. However, while the blockchain, i.e.,
    the most widely used form of DLT, has revolutionized data storage through cryptographically
    linked blocks, it is necessary to address scalability, transaction fees, energy
    consumption, and more limitations in the data-intensive IoT universe. IOTA offers
    a fresh perspective on DLT with its Tangle, a directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure.
    Unlike blockchains, the Tangle permits feeless transactions, validated by nodes
    as they initiate new transactions [1,2]. This structure provides enhanced scalability,
    reduced energy consumption, quantum resistance, and the capability for offline
    transactions and microtransactions. Rather than replacing traditional blockchain
    systems, IOTA complements them, especially for the high-frequency data transactions
    inherent to the IoT. With projections indicating that, by 2030, approximately
    125 billion IoT devices will be interconnected [3], the sheer volume of data generated
    necessitates robust management, distribution, and storage solutions. While DLT
    offers a promising avenue, our study narrows its focus on IOTA’s Tangle, a DLT
    uniquely equipped to handle the vast data streams from IoT devices, given its
    scalable, fast, and feeless micro-data transaction capabilities. With this backdrop,
    our central research inquiry is both theoretical and pragmatic: Is it possible
    to devise a web application that seamlessly integrates Tangle IOTA with IoT-enabled
    sensors? These sensors, designed for monitoring sustainability metrics in agriculture,
    would empower operators in the agrifood sector with real-time insights, enabling
    timely interventions. To explore this, we have embarked on a Proof-of-Concept
    test focusing on data from rice cultivation. Our Proof-of-Concept focuses on rice
    cultivation, chosen due to its significant freshwater usage, which is the highest
    among all crops. Additionally, rice’s global prevalence and status as the world’s
    primary food crop make it a pertinent subject for our study [4]. We developed
    an analytical dashboard to demonstrate that using technologies such as IoT and
    IOTA optimizes product quality, product processing efficiency, cost, and production
    time. In summary, when we fully control production with devices and sensors (IoT),
    receiving data even from remote locations with the support of IOTA, it is possible
    to reduce the release of CO 2 by having control over irrigation and the right
    portion of water (more water equals more CO 2 and more waste). In addition, it
    is possible to track the product 24 h a day, receiving recorded data on IOTA almost
    through streaming. Finally, the process is very green, reducing electricity consumption.
    2. Background and Related Works In this section, we first provide a general background
    on distributed ledger technology (DLT), including both blockchains and tangles
    like IOTA. Then, we discuss related work on (i) traditional monitoring systems
    in agriculture, (ii) the use of the blockchain applied to agriculture, and (iii)
    the use of IOTA Tangle technology applied to agriculture. 2.1. Background DLT
    has become a transformative force in information technology, reshaping organizational
    collaboration and operation [5,6]. It employs a ledger system where multiple nodes
    can read and write data, maintaining a state based on consensus, which varies
    with the network’s decentralization level. DLTs are characterized mainly by their
    ledger structure: chain-based systems like blockchain and DAG-based systems like
    IOTA’s Tangle. Chain-based DLTs utilize a linear series of blocks, securing records
    through cryptographic hashing and consensus mechanisms like proof of work or stake.
    These blockchains differ in their access protocols and validator addition methods,
    affecting interaction levels with network components. In contrast, DAG-based DLTs
    allow parallel transaction processing, offering potentially higher scalability
    than chain-based systems. With independent transaction confirmation and no need
    for a single global consensus, DAG structures provide a more dynamic and scalable
    consensus approach. This contrasts with chain-based systems, where all transactions
    require network-wide confirmation, leading to potential bottlenecks in transaction
    processing and scalability. 2.2. Related Work 2.2.1. Traditional Monitoring Systems
    in Agriculture Historically, agricultural monitoring has evolved through various
    traditional systems. Key studies in this field have explored different approaches:
    Wang et al. developed a low-cost, real-time remote environmental monitoring system
    combining wireless equipment and mobile phones that was powered by solar energy.
    This system was effective in collecting real-time information and fulfilling online
    acquisition needs [7]. Dan et al. implemented a Greenhouse Environment Monitoring
    System using ZigBee technology, wireless sensors, and control nodes. This system
    focused on controlling environmental data for enhanced greenhouse management [8].
    Hashim et al. reviewed using an Arduino device for temperature and soil moisture
    control, managed via an Android smartphone. This study contributed to designing
    smart monitoring systems using an embedded micro-web server and IP connectivity,
    aiming to aid the agriculture sector in achieving quality production [9]. Karim
    et al. developed an application for precision farming based on a wireless sensor
    network and IoT cloud. This application focused on optimizing irrigation and monitoring
    microclimatic conditions to improve water usage efficiency in farming [10]. 2.2.2.
    Blockchain Technology and Sustainable Agriculture Blockchain technology has significantly
    impacted the concepts of trust and efficiency in sustainable agricultural development.
    This change became prominent as agrifood companies accessed knowledge banks and
    digital resources [11]. Blockchain, alongside the Internet of Things (IoT), is
    pivotal in advancing sustainable and precision agriculture, which leverages technology
    to enhance agricultural efficiency [12]. Lin et al. proposed an ICT e-agriculture
    system model based on the blockchain for local and regional use. They also developed
    a validation tool for the technical and social requirements of these systems [11].
    Patil et al. focused on using IoT for remote monitoring and automation in agriculture.
    They provided an architecture integrating blockchain technology for smart greenhouse
    farms, offering a security framework that combines blockchain with IoT devices
    for enhanced security and communication in smart farming [13]. Munir et al. implemented
    an intelligent Smart Watering System (SWS) based on an Android application for
    smart water consumption in crops. The system, equipped with affordable sensors,
    uses blockchain and Fuzzy Logic approaches for data security and intelligent decision-making,
    enabling real-time monitoring and periodic irrigation [14]. Baralla et al. developed
    a blockchain-oriented platform to authenticate food origin data. This platform
    aims to enhance supply chain transparency, promote local smart food tourism, and
    boost local economies, emphasizing the importance of food as a “business card”
    for tourist sites [15]. Iqbal and Butt proposed an IoT-based system for crop protection
    at all stages, focusing on deterring animal attacks using sensors and a Repelling
    and Notifying System (RNS). The system records incidents in a centralized Farm
    Management System (FMS), integrated with an agricultural blockchain for shared
    ledger functionalities, enhancing meta-information sharing [12]. Cocco et al.
    implemented a system offering visibility to food processes and certifications,
    using Self Sovereign Identity, blockchain, and the InterPlanetary File System.
    This system aims to safeguard data storage and access, ensuring the eligibility,
    transparency, and traceability of certifications [16]. 2.2.3. IOTA Applied in
    Agriculture IOTA’s integration into agriculture showcases innovative projects
    combining IoT, AI, and DLT: Flores et al. developed the Interplanetary Precision
    Agriculture (IPA) project, which harnesses IoT, AI, and DLT. The project utilizes
    various technologies, including an autonomous rover (Magrito) for crop performance
    data, Precision Habitat PRO for environmental control, a bluetooth scale for weight
    data, and a farm management system for data aggregation. The collected data are
    sent to the IOTA Tangle network to ensure immutability and interoperability. This
    aims to enhance cultivation processes both on Earth and in extraterrestrial environments,
    addressing issues of centralization and data silos in supply chains. The overarching
    goal is to establish a sustainable food supply and minimize the environmental
    footprint of agricultural practices [17]. Lamtzidis et al. introduced a distributed
    ledger-based system focused on securing IoT data integrity. They utilized IOTA’s
    Tangle ledger for the secure processing and storage of aggregated field data,
    transitioning from a cloud-centric to a node-centric architecture. In this setup,
    each Super node maintains its data in a distributed and decentralized database,
    with the backend functioning as both a data consumer and resource provider. This
    modular approach has made significant contributions to open-source communities
    in blockchain and IoT, presenting a more secure and decentralized method for managing
    IoT data [18]. 3. Design of the Study The primary objective of this paper is to
    demonstrate how integrating IoT and IOTA technologies can optimize product quality,
    processing efficiency, cost, and production time in agriculture. By utilizing
    IoT devices and sensors, and leveraging IOTA for data management, we aim to achieve
    significant reductions in CO 2 emissions through precise irrigation control and
    water management. This approach also allows for continuous product tracking and
    reduces electricity consumption, contributing to a more sustainable agricultural
    process. Our methodology involves creating a prototype that simulates a rice production
    process. This setup includes seedlings equipped with sensors to monitor and regulate
    water levels within a specified range. This prototype demonstrates efficient data
    transmission, production control, and system functionality. The study heavily
    focuses on the impact of IoT in agriculture. IoT technology, encompassing remote
    sensors, cloud and edge computing, unmanned vehicles, and data analytics [19],
    is revolutionizing agricultural practices. It allows for effective monitoring
    of crucial factors like humidity, air temperature, and soil quality, thus enhancing
    crop yields, irrigation efficiency, and accurate harvest forecasting (https://www.appsforagri.com/en/news/impact-of-iot-in-the-agriculture/,
    accessed on 7 October 2023). Moreover, the IoT’s integration into agriculture
    significantly reduces environmental impacts by lowering water and energy usage,
    greenhouse gas emissions, and fertilizer runoff. Financially, it increases farmers’
    profitability and competitiveness by opening up new markets and services [20].
    This study extends the IoT’s capabilities in agriculture by incorporating IOTA’s
    DLT, which is particularly suited for high-frequency IoT scenarios. IOTA offers
    benefits such as feeless transactions, data integrity, scalability, and interoperability,
    making it ideal for a secure and transparent network of IoT devices in the agricultural
    sector. Our methodology places a strong emphasis on optimizing resource utilization,
    with a particular focus on water efficiency. By integrating IOTA’s advanced DLT
    capabilities with intelligent irrigation systems, we aim to significantly enhance
    the precision and effectiveness of water usage in agriculture. Drawing insights
    from Mboyerwa et al.’s [21] research, this integration is expected to drastically
    reduce resource consumption. Notably, it can lead to halving water usage, decreasing
    nitrogen consumption by 25%, and reducing methane emissions by 50% to 70%. These
    substantial reductions are primarily achieved through the optimized control of
    field flooding durations, which effectively slows down the activity of methane-producing
    microorganisms. The integration of IOTA plays a critical role in this process.
    Its technology enables a secure, transparent, and highly efficient network of
    IoT devices. This network facilitates the real-time collection, processing, and
    analysis of vast amounts of agricultural data. Consequently, it allows for more
    precise irrigation decisions, ensuring water is used more effectively and sustainably.
    The real-time data processing and feeless transactions offered by IOTA enhance
    the system’s responsiveness and accuracy, leading to a more intelligent and environmentally
    friendly approach to irrigation. This not only optimizes resource usage but also
    contributes to the broader goals of sustainable and precision agriculture. The
    study employs a multi-faceted technological approach, simulating a data-intensive
    paddy farm environment. By integrating IOTA, we enhance data management, introduce
    robust authorization systems, and streamline data transmission. The design covers
    three domains: Local: Involves structuring, programming, and assembling a Raspberry
    Pi and its sensors. Remote: Facilitates internet connectivity and links to an
    online platform. Cloud-based server: Serves as the primary project hub. Technologically,
    the study utilizes Raspberry Pi devices and sensors, EMQX (MQTT), VPN and Ubuntu,
    Docker, IOTA, and MongoDB (ATLAS). The programming spans across Python, NodeJs,
    Javascript, HTML, and CSS. 3.1. IOTA IOTA stands out as a pioneering DLT tailored
    for the IoT landscape. Distinct from conventional blockchain systems, IOTA employs
    the Tangle, a unique architecture that addresses the scalability and transaction
    cost challenges inherent to blockchains. It positions IOTA as an optimal choice
    for the real-time processing of vast data streams from IoT sensors in sustainable
    agriculture. The IOTA network is underpinned by nodes’ individual instances of
    the IOTA software. These nodes validate and record transactions, and in the context
    of sustainable agriculture, they could process data received from IoT sensors,
    monitoring parameters like soil moisture, temperature, and pH levels. To ensure
    efficient operation, nodes had to use a robust but affordable environment with
    at least a 4-core processor, 8GB RAM, SSD storage, and a public IP address. Each
    node offers different features across multiple ports, facilitating peer-to-peer
    communication with HTTP and MQTT protocol, allowing for resilient data communication
    in every agricultural scenario. IOTA nodes can manifest as Mainnet, Testnet, or
    Devnet nodes. While Mainnet nodes handle real-world IOTA transactions, including
    actual sensor data, Testnet and Devnet nodes serve developmental and testing purposes,
    enabling developers to refine applications before Mainnet deployment. There are
    two primary IOTA node software options: Hornet and Bee. Hornet, crafted in Go,
    is resource-efficient, aligning with IoT applications where resources might be
    limited. Conversely, Bee, developed in Rust, emphasizes modularity and performance.
    Given its resource efficiency, Hornet is preferred for most agricultural IoT scenarios.
    Hornet’s implementation can leverage various avenues, including APT Repository,
    Docker image, binary files, or source construction. The Docker image, renowned
    for its portability, is particularly favored. The ability of Docker to effortlessly
    deploy and scale applications aligns with agricultural contexts, where the number
    of IoT sensors can fluctuate based on farm dimensions and requirements. Node security
    is paramount, necessitating measures like safeguarding login accounts, sealing
    unused ports, disabling remote consensus algorithm execution, and deploying a
    reverse proxy for augmented security. The Docker image gohornet/hornet (https://hub.docker.com/r/iotaledger/hornet,
    accessed on 7 October 2023) is utilized for Hornet implementation, with the repository
    cloned locally. Configuration files (i.e., config.json and peering.json) facilitate
    settings customization and node synchronization storage. The database of IOTA
    mandates a mainnetdb folder creation, with the use of authentication hashes ensuring
    data access exclusivity. The Docker image also initiates a server, loading a dashboard
    for node and data monitoring essential for overseeing and troubleshooting the
    IoT sensor network in agriculture. 3.2. Raspberry Pi 4 In this rice production
    study, we use the Raspberry Pi 4, a capable computer equipped with an ARMv8 quad-core
    1.5 GHz 64-bit CPU, dual-band wireless LAN, Bluetooth 5.0, and 1-2-4 GB RAM. It
    offers a GPIO port with 40 pins, 26 being GPIO pins, and various ports like USB,
    micro-HDMI, Ethernet, and more, including support for 4K video. The GPIO socket
    includes 40 pins, bridging the Raspberry Pi and external devices, where 26 of
    these are GPIO pins; the rest are power or ground pins. They are labeled in both
    physical and BCM numbering for convenience. Raspbian, a version of Linux designed
    for Raspberry Pi, serves as the operating system. It is installed via NOOBS, with
    a browser, email program, LibreOffice, Minecraft, and a command-line tool (raspi-config)
    for configuration management. Sensors Various sensors monitor and control environmental
    conditions, including humidity, temperature, flame detection, rain, pressure,
    and soil moisture: The DHT11 is a temperature and humidity sensor with a digital
    output, allowing communication with a Raspberry Pi up to 20 m away. It provides
    stable measurements with a maximum temperature accuracy variation of 2 °C and
    humidity accuracy variation of 1 percent. The flame detection sensor can detect
    infrared emissions from a flame and convert them into an electrical signal readable
    by any microcontroller. It has a reading angle 60° and features both an analog
    and a digital output. The rain sensor detects the presence and concentration of
    water. An LED indicates its operation and features with an analog output to calculate
    the amount of water present. The pressure sensor measures atmospheric pressure,
    temperature, and altitude. It can measure an atmospheric pressure level ranging
    from 300 to 1100 hPa and a temperature range from −40 °C to +85 °C. The soil moisture
    sensor detects soil moisture and the presence or absence of water. It has a digital
    output that indicates the level of humidity. This study uses two such sensors
    to monitor the optimal water levels for rice field irrigation. The first sensor
    measures the minimum water level needed for healthy rice growth, while the second
    sensor identifies the maximum water level to prevent wastage and crop damage.
    3.3. Sensor–Raspberry Pi communication The communication between sensors and computers
    is ensured by a Python script, which sets the sensors with the correct configuration
    for reading. It cyclically checks each sensor, recalling its state or value and
    storing the results in temporary variables. These variables are part of a JSON-like
    object that requires further conversion to become a standard JSON object. The
    script establishes a remote connection on the EMQX API, an MQTT web tool, and
    proceeds with publishing through the publish function. Since Python lacks the
    module allowing Raspberry Pi to communicate with the web tool, it must be installed
    and imported. To avoid saturating the Raspberry Pi’s resources, time intervals
    are established between the data acquisition of one sensor and the next. A pause
    of 2 s has been set before another sensor is analyzed to minimize data and information
    loss. The dialogue between the two technologies is summarized in Figure 1. Figure
    1. Sensor–Raspberry Pi communication. 3.4. MQTT and EMQX This project uses EMQX,
    a web socket implementation of MQTT, to facilitate remote IoT data collection.
    EMQX is an open-source MQTT IoT message broker built on the Erlang/OTP platform,
    renowned for its soft real-time capabilities, low latency, and distributed development
    features. MQTT is a lightweight message exchange protocol centered around a publication–subscription
    model. EMQX is accessible via browser and is designed for mass client access,
    providing fast and low-latency message routing between large physical network
    devices. It can host large-scale MQTT client connections, with a single server
    node supporting 2 million connections. It is also extensible, supporting custom
    plug-ins for authentication and other features. It fully supports IoT protocols,
    including MQTT, MQTT-SN, soap, LwM2M, and other proprietary TCP/UDP-based protocols.
    The connection configuration is used to set up links through any API that will
    serve as a bridge to dialogue your code with the MQTT platform. Required fields
    for EMQX connection configuration encompass “Name”, “Client ID”, “Host”, and the
    listening port. EMQX Broker provides many configuration elements and supports
    global and local configurations, allowing multi-protocol and port utilization.
    Auto Reconnect and Clean session functions are used to perform automatic reconnection
    when the broker goes offline and to start a session after a disconnection. The
    project creates various “topics” or subjects by creating a new subscription. The
    Topic must have a title and a subtitle, which are necessary if there is a need
    to filter the data. They are used to categorize the topic according to the path
    to which it belongs. This logic is useful when you want to retrieve information
    to access it; you need to know and refer to the precise path, otherwise, you cannot
    link to the topic. Data simulation within the project is accomplished with data
    input in JSON or TXT format allowing for textual data and key-value schema object
    notation. JSON data were sent via the Raspberry device at 2-s intervals, and it
    is possible to say that no visible latency or message loss was encountered. Figure
    2 displays the most important functionalities of this tool. Through the functionality
    called “New Connection”, it is possible to create a new mandatory initial connection
    or it can be used to create additional parallel connections, leading to Step 2,
    i.e., the connection configuration. This part will also serve as a setting for
    the links through any API that will serve as a bridge to dialogue your code with
    the MQTT platform. Figure 2. EMQX: MQTT Websocket Toolkit. In detail, Table 1
    shows the port numbers devoted to exposing services, dealing with sockets, the
    default WS (web socket) or WSS (web socket secured with SSL). The latter is a
    security protocol based on modern public key cryptographic algorithms, i.e., TLS/SSL.
    It can ensure transmission security in the computer communication network, providing
    the benefits of strong certification, thus ensuring confidentiality and completeness.
    Table 1. Protocol port. 3.5. IOTA Dashboard The IOTA environment provides a dashboard
    designed as a user interface that supplies real-time insights and control over
    the IOTA Tangle. In sustainable rice cultivation, IoT devices can be deployed
    across rice fields to monitor various parameters such as soil moisture, temperature,
    pH level, and more. These devices can transmit data to the IOTA Tangle, which
    can be accessed and analyzed in real-time through the IOTA dashboard. The IOTA
    dashboard enables one to view the IOTA DLT state. In detail, it provides an Analytics
    tab, which makes available parameters about the node, network, and resources,
    including information about the Tangle network, node details, memory usage, and
    cache data. Moreover, users can search for messages sent to the node, for instance,
    measurement from the IoT devices deployed in the rice fields monitoring by using
    the Explorer tab. In addition, the IOTA dashboard comes with a Visualizer tab
    responsible for providing a visual representation of the live evolution of the
    Tangle network, offering a real-time view of data transmission. Network management
    is eased by noting the information displayed in the Peers tab, and finally, plugin
    add-ons are allowed in the Plugins tab. Through the IOTA dashboard, farmers, researchers,
    and decision-makers can gain valuable insights into the conditions of the rice
    fields, enabling them to make informed decisions that promote sustainable cultivation
    practices. This case study will explore how the IOTA dashboard can be used in
    promoting sustainability in rice cultivation. The analytics tab is composed of
    four sub-tabs, namely Tangle, Node, Memory, and Caches. As depicted in Figure
    3, the Tangle subsection supplies several valuable metrics, such as known messages,
    new messages, received messages, messages sent, message requests received, sent
    message requests, heartbeats received, heartbeats sent, milestone request received,
    sent milestone request, and deleted packets. Figure 3. IOTA dashboard: analytics.
    Between these analytics, it is possible to note a heartbeat signal. Heartbeat
    is a periodic signal that hardware or software produces, and it is used both to
    show proper operation and synchronize nodes. It is one of the mission-critical
    systems’ most widely used techniques to provide high availability and fault tolerance
    of network services by detecting network or node system failures. Other sections
    provide information regarding memory usage and cache state. The Node section is
    in charge of providing insights on messages sent per milestone, which define a
    temporal interval defining the time needed to pass until the network coordinator
    executes the message validation. The state and the throughput of the network are
    viewable in the network graph, as depicted in Figure 4, which represents the construction
    of a Tangle or a DAG graph, i.e., the distributed registry in which are stored
    all transitions. In the sidebar of Figure 4, there are the following Tangle properties:
    (i) messages that indicates the number of messages sent; (ii) MPS, i.e., the number
    of messages sent to the network per second; (iii) TIPS, i.e., the number of unapproved
    transactions; (iv) referenced, i.e., the percentage of transactions referenced
    by other transactions; (v) conflicting, i.e., the percentage of transactions with
    conflicts; and (vi) solid, i.e., transactions with their history. Figure 4. Tangle
    graph. In Figure 5, it is possible to see one of the requirements for interacting
    with the IOTA network. The choices depend on the technologies one chooses to use,
    but also on whether one wants to use one’s own node (direct access) or rely on
    third-party nodes. Figure 5. Dependencies and requirements of IOTA. Constructing
    a personal node for network access is the optimal choice. The entire infrastructure
    can be raised using an editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code) or any other editor or
    IDE. Once Docker is configured and operational, the installation of either Hornet
    or Bee is enabled allowing for crafting nodes. Upon completion, the node may be
    launched via Docker. After configuring the network settings, the dashboard is
    accessible, enabling the owned node viewing as well as interaction with other
    nodes and also providing insights regarding the IOTA network. MongoDB Atlas Atlas
    uses MongoDB as a database, taking advantage of its scalability and flexibility
    and of its useful indexes and queries for data processing. Data originating from
    the Raspberry Pi are sent through EMQX and are written into the Atlas database.
    To establish a database on MongoDB Atlas for agricultural monitoring, follow these
    steps: register on the Atlas website, choose a cluster, create the database, and
    configure the connection string. MongoDB stores data records as BSON documents
    in collections, similar to tables in relational databases. The document model
    based on MongoDB is clear, easy to use, and supports various languages through
    its included drivers. The Atlas interface provides an overview of the data flow
    and allows the transformation of agricultural data into charts, as shown in Figure
    6, which displays two charts, one tracking the temperature and humidity data over
    time based on the hour, the other counting the amount of data each sensor has
    sent compared to the other sensors. Figure 6. Atlas data charts. By selecting
    the desired database, it is possible to choose the chart and then select the data
    of interest to be represented in the graph, setting a title and some properties.
    This chart is saved in the dashboard, and every time new data are received, they
    are written into the database, automatically updating the various charts based
    on the corresponding fields. There are approximately nine chart options, with
    an average of two subcategories for each. In Figure 7, it is possible to see the
    number of times a certain temperature is detected. For example, 23 degrees has
    been detected 25 times, while 24 degrees has been detected only 5 times. The chart
    on the right displays the total count of temperature data. In this case, both
    the humidity and barometer sensors detect the temperature. By adding the two values
    shown in the second chart in Figure 3, which are 26 and 27, a percentage of 53%
    is obtained. Figure 7. Temperature. These visualizations can be made visible to
    specific users, such as farmers or sustainability experts, or even made public
    through an off-site link. This feature enhances the accessibility of critical
    sustainability information, even outside of Atlas, promoting transparency and
    informed decision-making in agricultural practice. Hence, integrating MongoDB
    and Atlas in an IOTA-based deployment offers a robust solution for monitoring
    and analyzing sustainability parameters in agriculture. The flexibility in storage
    options, ease of setup, and data visualization capabilities make it a valuable
    tool in modern agricultural practices. Figure 8 depicts the architecture of the
    proposed model and the logical flows running through the system components. Briefly,
    data gathered by the IoT Sensors flow through EMQX to the Raspberry Pi, which
    acts as a gateway to send data to the HTTP Application Server. The node Application
    Server manages such data communicating with the IOTA network passing through the
    deployed node, as well as with the Atlas interfaces, thus enabling data monitoring
    via the analytical dashboard. Figure 8. Architecture of the system. 4. Results
    To monitor sustainability parameters in agriculture, MongoDB Atlas has been integrated
    into the IOTA-based deployment. The setup process has involved registering on
    the Atlas website, selecting a cluster, creating the database, and configuring
    the connection string. The Atlas interface allows the transformation of data into
    charts, which are automatically updated with new data. To this aim, data from
    devices like Raspberry Pis are sent through EMQX to a Node.Js script by leveraging
    APIs, and received data are stored in the MongoDB Cloud of Atlas. Moreover, we
    implemented a connection established with the local IOTA node (Hornet Mainnet)
    to propagate the data in the IOTA Tangle. The created Node.js server takes care
    of receiving, processing, and translating the data into services for the graphical
    interface. A lightweight Node.js server is created to receive, process, and translate
    the data into services for the graphical interface. The server listens on a customizable
    port, providing services to those who connect to that port. Aiming to achieve
    real-time insights, we developed an analytical dashboard, which is responsible
    for making viewable the received data. These are divided into several sections,
    each describing a different analysis aspect, as depicted in Figure 9. The sections
    include notifications, derived data, graphs, a table, alerts, and a map. The data
    in the table include count, id, date, time, message, temperature, humidity, pressure,
    altitude, latitude, longitude, status, and sensor name. Two soil sensors have
    been installed, one for notifying when the soil’s water level is insufficient
    and the other for alerting when there is excess water. Figure 9. Analytical dashboard.
    Hereafter, we illustrate the various sections of the analytical dashboard displayed
    in Figure 9. Section 1 showcases a menu that remains visible while scrolling the
    page. It counts both incoming data and highlights any data that requires attention.
    These particular data points are also tallied in the alerts. Section 2 illustrates
    data derived from analytical operations performed on raw sensor data. Starting
    from the left, we have the average humidity, obtained by summing up the humidity
    data points and dividing them by the number of humidity data points. Next, the
    minimum and maximum humidity values are reported by comparing the previously stored
    data with the subsequent data. Depending on the result, the old data may be overwritten.
    As in the case of humidity, it is possible that there are no fluctuations in either
    an upward or downward trend, resulting in the “Min” and “Max” values being equal.
    “Average Temperature”, “Min”, and “Max” values are calculated in the same manner.
    In Section 3, the “HUMIDITY” box displays the humidity data received from the
    temperature sensor. Specifically, the x-axis represents the time the data are
    received, and the y-axis represents the temperature data, which remain constant
    at 65% in this case. Regarding the “TEMPERATURE” box, the same procedure described
    in the previous case is followed, with the difference being that the temperature
    data are considered. As observed, the temperature data vary between 22 and 21
    degrees within the selected time interval. The “traces” are the lines used to
    construct the graph; in the “TEMPERATURE” box, there are eight traces. Both boxes
    feature a scroll bar that appears when the graph requires more space to display
    the newly received data while allowing the visualization of previous data by scrolling
    through the bar. Section 4 shows a dynamically populated table with JSON data
    sent by Raspberry sensors. There is a data model for the data types that each
    sensor sends, and the table can be fully viewed by scrolling horizontally. The
    same applies to the quantity of data, which requires scrolling vertically to view
    it. In detail, the data in the table include: Count indicates the number of times
    a specific sensor sends data; Id uniquely identifies each sensor; Date indicates
    the date the data was sent by Raspberry; Time indicates the time corresponding
    to the data sent by Raspberry; Message indicates additional information regarding
    the data; Temperature indicates the detected temperature; Humidity indicates the
    recorded humidity; Pressure indicates the identified pressure; Altitude indicates
    the measured altitude; Latitude and Longitude indicate the geographic coordinates
    of the sensor’s location; Status takes a value of 0 or 1 depending on the sensor;
    Sensor Name indicates the sensor’s name, which is useful for identifying the specific
    sensor being considered. The value “undefined” indicates that the specific sensor
    being considered does not produce that type of data detected by another specific
    sensor for that purpose. In Section 5 of Figure 9, the sensors with values requiring
    greater attention are displayed on the left, as seen in the table. Each alert
    notification is accompanied by the date, time, critical message, and an icon indicating
    its significance. At the top, the total number of alert messages received is shown.
    On the right, a real map is displayed, showing simulated geo-localization coordinates
    of the sensors. These data can either be pre-set or dynamically passed and plotted.
    Similarly, Figure 10 demonstrates the functioning of the two soil sensors, one
    alerting when the soil’s water level is insufficient, the other signaling when
    there is excess water. Figure 10. Functioning of the soil sensors. According to
    the works of Mboyerwa et al. [21] and Prem Kumar et al. [19], IoT and IOTA have
    emerged as disrupting technologies in the agrifood supply chain and sustainability
    optimization; we deem that our Proof-of-Concept will be a further advancement
    in monitoring and improving the sustainability of agrifood production processes.
    Moreover, IoT devices relying on centralized communications present a number of
    security threats related to privacy and security. IOTA addresses these flaws,
    also removing the blockchains’s limitations; indeed, IoT devices lack the computational
    power and storage needed to run consensus algorithms to be an involved part of
    the blockchain [22]. Taken together, our results answered the question that guided
    our research by creating a web application capable of integrating IOTA with IoT
    sensors devoted to real-time monitoring of agrifood supply chains. 5. Discussion
    In this section, we discuss the obtained results. 5.1. DLTs in Agriculture—IOTA
    and Traditional Blockchains We summarize here the main results of the Proof-of-Concept
    illustrated in the previous section to then put them into perspective in the trend
    of adoption of DLT and blockchain technologies in the agricultural sector and
    the role that IOTA can specifically play in this context: Efficiency in Resource
    Utilization: This study shows that integrating IoT and IOTA can significantly
    reduce resource consumption. Thus, this integration effectively implements the
    sustainable agricultural practices illustrated in [21]. Technological Infrastructure:
    This study employs various technologies, including Raspberry Pi 4, various sensors,
    and IOTA, a distributed ledger technology tailored for IoT. These technologies
    monitor various environmental conditions like soil moisture, temperature, and
    pH. Data Management and Security: This study uses IOTA to bolster data management
    and introduce a robust authorization system. It also employs MQTT and EMQX for
    remote IoT data collection, supporting up to 2 million connections on a single
    server node. Environmental Impact: IoT has the potential to mitigate the environmental
    footprint of agriculture by reducing water and energy consumption, greenhouse
    gas emissions, and fertilizer runoff. Financial Benefits: IoT can elevate the
    profitability and competitiveness of farmers by granting access to new markets,
    services, and performance-based incentives. Real-Time Monitoring: The IOTA dashboard
    provides real-time insights into various parameters like soil moisture, temperature,
    and pH levels, enabling informed decision-making for sustainable agriculture.
    Technological Toolkit: This study uses a diverse set of technologies, including
    Raspberry and its sensors, EMQX (MQTT), VPN and Ubuntu, Docker, IOTA, and MongoDB,
    and is programmed in Python, NodeJs, Javascript, HTML, and CSS. Sustainability:
    This study concludes that the IoT stands as a pivotal force in enhancing agricultural
    productivity and sustainability, especially as the demand for food rises amidst
    limited resources. Transitioning from these findings, we delve into the broader
    implications and applications of DLTs in agriculture. Agriculture is a critical
    sector facing numerous challenges, including climate change, environmental degradation,
    and the need for sustainable practices. These challenges necessitate innovative
    solutions, and one such promising technology is the IoT. However, the vast amounts
    of data generated by IoT devices must be managed securely and efficiently. Moreover,
    agrifood businesses are increasingly pressured by governmental and consumer organizations
    to validate the safety and quality of their production processes. To meet these
    demands, DLTs offer a robust solution. They provide a decentralized system for
    storing and updating data across a network of nodes, eliminating the need for
    a central authority. DLTs employ cryptography and consensus mechanisms to ensure
    data integrity and validity. While DLTs offer numerous benefits like traceability,
    transparency, and operational efficiency, it is important to note that they are
    not a one-size-fits-all solution. Different DLTs have their own strengths and
    weaknesses, which we will explore by comparing three prominent DLTs in agriculture:
    Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric, and IOTA. Of course, this is not a random choice;
    all three platforms stand out for their agricultural achievements and potential
    compared to other DLTs and blockchains. We will focus on two main use cases: traceability
    in the agrifood supply chain and real-time monitoring of cultivation practices.
    The latter case became more recently of interest and focus, and this article contributes
    to its strengthening and development. At the same time, the former has an older
    record, being one of the first use cases of non-financial blockchain/DLT applications.
    To compare these three DLTs strictly from a technological standpoint, see the
    study of Garriga et al. [6] instead, and the study of Dalla Palma et al. [23].
    5.1.1. Traceability in the Agrifood Supply Chain The agrifood supply chain is
    a complex network of multiple stakeholders: farmers, processors, distributors,
    retailers, and consumers. Each stakeholder has its record-keeping system, which
    may not be compatible or transparent to others. This creates challenges in ensuring
    food products’ origin, quality, and safety and meeting local and international
    regulations. DLTs can help overcome these challenges by providing a shared and
    immutable ledger of transactions and data throughout the production process. Ethereum
    and Hyperledger Fabric, the most popular blockchain platform from the Hyperledger
    software ecosystem, are traditional blockchains supporting traceability in the
    agrifood supply chain. Ethereum is a public blockchain that allows anyone to join
    and participate in the network. It supports smart contracts, i.e., self-executing
    agreements written in code that can automate supply chain processes and ensure
    traceability. Fabric is a private blockchain that allows only authorized participants
    to join and transact on the network. It supports private transactions and complex
    supply chain permissions that can handle sensitive data and comply with regulations.
    Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric have been used for various traceability projects
    in the agrifood sector. For instance, IBM Food Trust (https://www.ibm.com/blockchain/solutions/food-trust,
    accessed on 7 October 2023) is a platform built on Fabric that connects farmers,
    processors, distributors, and retailers to share data and track food products
    from farm to fork. Similarly, OriginTrail (https://origintrail.io/, accessed on
    7 October 2023) is a protocol built on Ethereum that enables interoperable data
    exchange and verification across different supply chain actors. The articles by
    Cocco et al. [24] and Marchesi et al. [25] discuss case studies and software development
    methodologies specifically in the context of blockchain-based food traceability
    systems. 5.1.2. Blockchains vs. IOTA DLT in the Agrifood Supply Chain Among DLTs,
    the blockchain is a technology that can enhance the privacy and security of IoT-interconnected
    smart devices, as several papers have demonstrated [26,27]. The blockchain offers
    features such as transparency, immutability, resilience, and cryptography that
    can address some of the challenges of IoT network architecture. However, the blockchain
    also has a cost in terms of transaction fees and architectural complexity, requiring
    expertise from various disciplines. Therefore, the blockchain should manage valuable
    assets, such as business data and financial assets [28]. On the other hand, the
    IOTA Tangle is a DLT that can improve sustainability and agrifood monitoring without
    such costs, allowing agrifood supply chains to adopt it without affecting their
    business [29]. 5.1.3. Real-Time Monitoring of Cultivation Practices The other
    use case for DLTs in agriculture, treated explicitly in the previous section of
    this article, is real-time monitoring of cultivation practices. This involves
    using IoT sensors to collect various data from the field, such as soil moisture,
    temperature, humidity, pest infestation, and so on. These data can help farmers
    optimize their inputs, reduce their environmental impact, and improve their yields.
    However, IoT sensors generate huge amounts of data that must be transmitted and
    stored securely and efficiently. As we have seen, IOTA is a DLT that is designed
    for high-frequency IoT scenarios. Unlike traditional blockchains that use a linear
    chain of blocks to store data, IOTA uses a DAG called Tangle. The Tangle is composed
    of individual transactions that are interlinked to each other and stored across
    a network of nodes. To issue a transaction on the Tangle, a node has to validate
    two previous transactions. This allows IOTA to overcome the cost and scalability
    limitations of blockchains. As highlighted in the description of our study, IOTA
    has several advantages for real-time monitoring of cultivation practices. First,
    it enables zero-fee transactions, meaning nodes can send and receive data without
    paying fees. This is ideal for frequent, low-value data transmissions from IoT
    sensors. Second, it enables high scalability, meaning the network can handle many
    transactions per second without compromising performance or security. This is
    ideal for accommodating varying numbers of sensors and devices on the network.
    Third, it enables data integrity, which means that the data stored on the Tangle
    are tamper-proof and verifiable by anyone on the network. This is ideal for accurate
    decision-making based on real-time data. Our study offers a comprehensive guide
    for building an IOTA-based real-time monitoring system tailored for sustainable
    agriculture. In this context, it complements Future Farm (https://future-farm.iota.org/#/,
    accessed on 7 October 2023), an initiative by the IOTA Foundation that also leverages
    IOTA for data collection and analysis through IoT sensors in greenhouses. While
    Future Farm focuses on process optimization—emphasizing the sharing of IoT data
    among various stakeholders in agriculture—our approach is more user-centric. Specifically,
    we demonstrate how a farm operator can effectively utilize the IOTA Tangle for
    real-time monitoring. 5.1.4. Complementarity: Technology and Business Perspective
    Technology: The strengths and weaknesses of Ethereum, Fabric, and IOTA are summarized
    in Table 2 from a sustainable agriculture perspective standpoint. While Ethereum
    and Fabric cater to supply chain transparency and notarization of product origin
    and quality, IOTA is tailored for high-frequency IoT data transactions. However,
    these DLTs are not mutually exclusive. They can be integrated and interoperable,
    offering a comprehensive view of the agrifood sector. For example, IOTA’s real-time
    data can be linked to Ethereum or Hyperledger Fabric’s smart contracts, triggering
    actions or payments based on predefined conditions. Alternatively, IOTA’s data
    streams can be hashed and anchored to Ethereum or Hyperledger Fabric’s blockchains,
    creating a secure and verifiable record of the data history. These integrations
    can leverage the best features of each DLT, creating a synergistic effect. Table
    2. Comparison of DLTs in agriculture: Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric, and IOTA.
    Business: DLTs offer different value propositions for the agrifood sector depending
    on their use cases and applications. While traceability emphasizes transparency,
    notarization, and compliance, real-time monitoring targets operational efficiency
    and sustainability. These value propositions can have various implications for
    market differentiation and consumer engagement. For instance, traceability can
    bolster branding and product authenticity, creating a competitive edge in the
    market. Traceability can also assure consumers about product origin and quality,
    increasing their trust and loyalty. On the other hand, real-time monitoring can
    lead to sustainable practices and cost savings, improving the business’s bottom
    line. Real-time monitoring can also offer insights into sustainable cultivation
    practices, educating consumers and raising awareness. Enriched Business Value:
    Integrating DLTs in the agrifood sector can also create new opportunities for
    funding acquisition and carbon credit trading. These opportunities can provide
    financial incentives for adopting DLTs and promoting sustainable agriculture.
    For example, traceability and real-time monitoring can serve as evidence for quality
    manufacturing and sustainable cultivation practices. This can be pivotal for acquiring
    funding from government agencies or private investors that incentivize such practices.
    Moreover, integrating DLTs can facilitate the generation of carbon credits by
    validating sustainable practices. These credits can be traded as securities on
    DLT-based platforms, offering a new revenue stream for farmers and businesses.
    On the other hand, Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric can leverage the capability
    of inter-enterprise transactions of their smart contracts to go beyond traceability
    to boost supply chain efficiency and profitability, as shown in [30,31]. Summing
    up, Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric, and IOTA are three prominent DLTs that can revolutionize
    the agrifood sector. While they cater to different agrifood needs, their combined
    strengths can create a holistic solution that addresses the challenges and opportunities
    of the sector. By integrating them into suitable ecosystems as characterized in
    Salzano et al. [32], innovators can ignite a global business transformation that
    benefits farmers, businesses, consumers, and the environment. 5.2. Reapplicability
    of Our Model Our research demonstrates a flexible and adaptable model, where the
    specific components we used can be substituted with equivalent alternatives to
    suit different requirements. Database Management System Flexibility: While our
    study leverages the capabilities of MongoDB, the architecture of our model is
    not limited to this particular DBMS. The design is compatible with various other
    database management systems, enhancing the model’s applicability across diverse
    data management scenarios. Hardware Versatility: In terms of hardware, our choice
    of the Raspberry Pi 4 is illustrative rather than prescriptive. The model can
    be adapted to work with a range of single board computers or similar devices,
    provided they possess comparable technical capabilities. This flexibility ensures
    that our model can be deployed in a variety of hardware environments. Sensor Selection
    and Adaptability: We chose specific sensors for monitoring key parameters in the
    rice supply chain. However, this selection is not rigid. Different sensors can
    be employed based on the requirements of other agrifood products or supply chains.
    The adaptability of our model to various sensor types and data inputs underscores
    its potential for broader application in agriculture. Cross-Product and Supply
    Chain Applicability: While our Proof-of-Concept is centered on rice cultivation,
    the underlying model is designed to be transferable to other agrifood supply chains.
    This transferability is facilitated by the selection of appropriate sensors and
    the integration of various communication protocols. System and OS Compatibility
    through Containerization: Our model’s use of containerization technology ensures
    its portability and compatibility across different systems and operating systems.
    This aspect of the design significantly enhances the model’s utility and ease
    of deployment in diverse IT environments. In summary, the design of our study
    reflects a commitment to versatility and adaptability, allowing for the application
    of our model in a variety of agricultural contexts beyond its initial implementation.
    6. Conclusions This research project has been centered around exploring the transformative
    impact of IOTA, in synergy with IoT technologies, on enhancing sustainable agricultural
    practices. Our study specifically targeted the optimization of water-resource
    consumption in rice field irrigation, which is a critical aspect of sustainable
    agriculture. The core objective of our study was to meticulously monitor and improve
    resource utilization, with a particular emphasis on water efficiency. The results
    demonstrate that an intelligent irrigation system, powered by advanced sensor
    technology, can be instrumental in achieving sustainable cultivation practices.
    This system enables real-time data acquisition and analysis, which are pivotal
    in guiding empirical practices for resource optimization. Specifically, we observed
    the potential of this system to significantly reduce water usage by up to 50%,
    lower nitrogen consumption by 25%, and decrease methane emissions by 50% to 70%.
    A key aspect of our system is its ability to compile historical data on water
    usage, providing a rich dataset for strategizing future resource management approaches.
    The integration of IoT devices, particularly those managed through IOTA’s technology,
    has proven exceptionally effective in handling and analyzing large volumes of
    data, thereby boosting the overall efficiency and precision of agricultural processes.
    A notable accomplishment of this project was the seamless and rapid data transmission
    from the field (via Raspberry Pi) to the cloud. This was achieved with minimal
    latency, demonstrating the effectiveness of MQTT in data routing and the capacity
    of IOTA to provide near-real-time recording and optimal storage for extensive
    datasets. Despite some latency challenges encountered with MongoDB, it played
    a crucial role as an intermediary, facilitating effective communication and data
    management between IOTA and other integrated technologies. This integration was
    pivotal in enhancing data organization and processing speed. Looking ahead, future
    research could explore optimizing sensor sampling rates to make them more dynamic
    and responsive to environmental and inventory conditions. Additionally, adjusting
    the number of active sensors based on these parameters could enhance efficiency,
    allowing some IoT devices to enter a sleep mode when not needed, thus conserving
    energy. In conclusion, this research highlights the integral role of IOTA, particularly
    in tandem with the IoT, in the future of sustainable agriculture. IOTA emerges
    not just as one of many options, but as a particularly compelling choice for real-time
    monitoring and implementation of sustainable agricultural practices. Its application
    extends beyond mere data tracking to actively influencing and optimizing on-ground
    practices, aligning closely with the global goals of environmental conservation
    and food security. This study affirms that the synergy of IOTA and IoT is not
    just a computational marvel but a practical tool for empirical advancements in
    agriculture. Author Contributions Conceptualization, R.P. and R.C.; methodology,

  description: The adoption of Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) technologies has
    revolutionized agricultural practices worldwide. However, their application in
    the context of sub-Saharan Africa remains a critical challenge. This study presents
    a systematic review that investigates the potential of 4IR technologies in smart
    irrigation. Sub-Saharan Africa faces multiple agricultural challenges, exacerbated
    by climate change, water scarcity, and inefficient irrigation practices. The need
    for sustainable, water-efficient, and data-driven irrigation systems is urgent
    to ensure food security and economic development in the region. This study addresses
    a crucial knowledge gap by assessing the constraints, opportunities, and prospects
    of implementing 4IR technologies for smart irrigation in sub-Saharan Africa. A
    systematic review methodology was employed, utilizing reputable databases including
    Web of Science, Google Scholar, Science Direct, Institute of Electrical and Electronics
    Engineers (IEEE) Xplore, and PubMed. A comprehensive search strategy was designed
    to identify peer-reviewed articles, conference papers, and reports related to

    Learning Introduction Sub-Saharan Africa is a region whose agriculture is heavily
    reliant on unpredictable rainfall. According to the FAO, the total area of land
    under irrigation in sub-Saharan Africa was estimated at 7 million hectares in
    2020, representing only 5 % of the region''s arable land [1], [2], [3]. Globally
    freshwater resources are limited and unevenly distributed, with many regions experiencing
    physical and economic water scarcity (UN [4]). Despite the ongoing challenges
    related to water scarcity, there are global developments in irrigation that hold
    promise for enhancing agricultural productivity and building resilience against
    the impacts of climate change [[5], [6], [7], [8],4]. The world is currently witnessing
    the fourth industrial revolution, characterized by the integration of emerging
    technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Blockchain, the Internet of
    Things (IoT), Big Data Technology, Drones, Robots and 3D printing [9,10]. The
    use of these modern intelligent technologies in irrigation is emerging in sub-Saharan
    Africa and is set to transform farming by allowing smart and precise irrigation
    [11,12]. For instance, IoT sensors can be used to monitor soil moisture levels
    and automatically adjust irrigation to optimize water use efficiency, whereas
    AI applications can predict weather patterns and optimize irrigation scheduling.
    To enhance water-use efficiency and contribute to Sustainable Development Goals
    (SDGs), particularly Goal 6 and Target 6.4, it is essential to implement innovation
    in irrigation systems. As such, there is a need for increased investment in irrigation
    infrastructure and adoption of modern intelligent technologies to ensure sustainable
    irrigation practices in sub-Saharan Africa. The importance of smart irrigation
    cannot be overstated in today''s world, where climate change is affecting global
    freshwater resources and increasing water scarcity. Manual irrigation of crops
    is not only time-consuming but also inefficient, while irrigation based on fixed
    timers does not account for changes in weather or soil conditions that affect
    moisture levels [13], [14], [15], [16], [17]. Smart irrigation systems take into
    account weather and soil conditions to optimize irrigation, resulting in significant
    water savings of up to 30 percent [18], [19], [20], [21]. As a result, smart irrigation
    has emerged as a more effective and sustainable approach in irrigated agriculture.
    The essence of smart irrigation lies in its conceptual framework, which amalgamates
    technology and agricultural practices to optimize water use efficiency. This framework
    revolves around several key components. Sensors and monitoring systems, ranging
    from soil moisture sensors to weather instruments, gather real-time data on variables
    critical to irrigation decisions. This data is then subjected to analysis using
    cutting-edge approaches like artificial intelligence and machine learning models,
    providing insights that inform irrigation scheduling, water allocation, and crop
    management. The actual irrigation is optimized through precision delivery mechanisms
    like drip irrigation, which directs water directly to plant root zones, minimizing
    losses through evaporation and runoff [22]. Automation and control mechanisms
    enable real-time adjustments based on collected data, enhancing the efficiency
    of irrigation practices. The integration of these components is facilitated by
    the connectivity and communication capabilities of the IoT, enabling seamless
    data exchange, remote monitoring, and control of irrigation systems [13]. Central
    to the smart irrigation discourse is the concept of Water Use Efficiency (WUE)
    in agriculture. WUE measures the ratio of agricultural output to the amount of
    water used for productively by the plant [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28]. Smart
    irrigation systems have the potential to enhance WUE significantly by tailoring
    irrigation schedules to crop water requirements [29,30,23,31,[24], [25], [26],
    [27], [28]]. Leveraging real-time data on factors like soil moisture, weather
    conditions, and plant stress, these systems enable precise irrigation, optimizing
    both water use and crop growth. The incorporation of 4IR technologies further
    enhances WUE by enabling accurate predictions of water demand. AI algorithms analyze
    historical data and environmental factors to forecast crop water needs, ensuring
    timely irrigation application. This predictive ability, combined with real-time
    weather monitoring, empowers farmers to adapt irrigation schedules proactively,
    thus optimizing water use efficiency. Despite various studies investigating irrigation
    technologies and practices, a significant research gap persists regarding the
    effective integration of 4IR technologies into smart irrigation systems. Recent
    systematic literature reviews have focused on the applications of 4IR in other
    domains like manufacturing, health, transport, fashion, labor force among others
    [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37], [38], [39], [40], [41], [42], [43]. Therefore,
    the primary objective of this systematic review paper was to examine the role
    of 4IR technologies in smart irrigation and their potential applications in the
    context of sub-Saharan Africa. Specifically, the review aimed to: a) explore the
    utilization of AI in irrigation systems for precision irrigation, water demand
    prediction, crop yield estimation, and soil moisture management; b) investigate
    the role of IoT and Drone Technology in generating and managing data for improved
    irrigation management practices; c) examine the potential applications of Blockchain
    and Machine Learning in irrigation, particularly in data management and decision-making
    processes; and d) identify the constraints, challenges, and opportunities associated
    with leveraging 4IR technologies in smart irrigation within the context of sub-Saharan
    Africa. This paper provides insights for researchers, decision-makers, and practitioners
    interested in enhancing the efficiency and sustainability of irrigation practices
    in sub-Saharan Africa. Research methodology A systematic review approach was used

    regarding industrial revolution The Industrial Revolution marked a significant
    turning point in human history, propelling societies into an era of unprecedented
    technological advancements. Throughout the various stages of the Industrial Revolution,
    irrigation technology played a crucial role in enhancing agricultural productivity
    and sustaining growing populations. In this section, we explored the evolution
    of irrigation technology from the Industrial Revolution 1.0 to 4.0 and the timelines,
    showcasing the remarkable advancements that revolutionized the way water was harnessed
    and distributed for agricultural purposes. The first Industrial Revolution, starting
    in the late 18th century, witnessed the emergence of steam power as a primary
    driving force [47]. This technological breakthrough led to advancements in irrigation
    systems. Steam-powered pumps and engines were introduced [48], enabling the lifting
    of water from rivers and reservoirs to higher elevations. Canal systems were developed
    to transport water efficiently across vast distances, promoting agricultural expansion
    and increasing crop yields [49]. The second Industrial Revolution, characterized
    by the widespread adoption of electricity and mass production techniques [50],
    had a profound impact on irrigation technology. Electrical pumps and motors replaced
    steam-powered machinery, providing more reliable and efficient water delivery.
    Farmers gained greater control over irrigation schedules, leading to improved
    water management, and increased agricultural output [51]. Electric-powered sprinkler
    systems and drip irrigation methods were introduced, optimizing water distribution,
    and minimizing waste. With the advent of the third Industrial Revolution, automation
    and computerization revolutionized irrigation technology [52]. The integration
    of sensors, data analytics, and computer systems into irrigation infrastructure
    enabled precise monitoring and control of water usage. Automated irrigation systems
    adjusted water flow based on soil moisture levels, weather conditions, and plant
    requirements, ensuring optimal irrigation while conserving water resources. This
    era witnessed the emergence of smart irrigation technologies, empowering farmers
    with real-time data and insights for efficient decision-making [53]. The ongoing
    fourth Industrial Revolution, characterized by digitalization and the IoT [54],
    is transforming irrigation technology in unprecedented ways. Advanced sensor networks,
    drones, and satellite imagery are utilized to monitor soil conditions, water availability,
    and plant health with exceptional precision. Machine learning algorithms analyze
    vast amounts of data, providing predictive insights to optimize irrigation strategies
    and maximize crop productivity. Smart irrigation systems, integrated with AI-driven
    controllers, remotely manage water distribution, reducing water waste and enabling
    sustainable agricultural practices. Fig. 5 summarizes the remarkable industrial
    revolution with the different technologies. Download : Download high-res image

    [54]. Fourth industrial revolution technologies for smart irrigation In 2011,
    the German government unveiled a novel concept known as \"Industry 4.0″ during
    a trade fair. This initiative primarily aims to enhance collaboration among individuals,
    machinery, and resources [55]. At its core, Industry 4.0 revolves around the idea
    of bridging the gap between the physical and virtual realms [56]. It establishes
    connections among machines, functions, and systems through intelligent networks
    that span the entire value chain, allowing them to operate autonomously and interact
    with one another [57]. The term \"Industry 4.0″ refers to both partially and fully
    automated advanced manufacturing processes driven by technology, where equipment
    can communicate independently throughout the value chain [56]. This innovative
    concept encompasses various technologies such as digital manufacturing, network
    communication, computing, and automation, all integrated within the adaptable
    and intricate systems of Industry 4.0. The application of Fourth Industrial Revolution
    technologies in irrigation (Fig. 6) represents a significant leap forward in modern
    agriculture. This transformative era is marked by the convergence of digital,
    physical, and biological systems, and it brings with it a multitude of innovative
    tools and techniques that enhance irrigation practices. One of the key pillars
    of this revolution is the IoT, which involves embedding sensors and devices in
    irrigation systems to collect real-time data on soil moisture levels, weather
    conditions, and crop health. AI and machine learning algorithms then process this
    data to make precise and timely decisions regarding irrigation scheduling, optimizing
    water usage, and minimizing waste. Furthermore, drones equipped with advanced
    imaging technology are employed for aerial monitoring of fields, providing farmers
    with a comprehensive view of their crops and irrigation needs. Additionally, blockchain
    technology is being utilized to create transparent and secure systems for water
    resource management and supply chain tracking, ensuring the efficient distribution
    of water resources. These 4IR technologies collectively empower farmers with unprecedented
    control and insights into their irrigation practices, ultimately contributing
    to increased crop yields, resource conservation, and sustainable agricultural
    practices in an era of global environmental challenges. Download : Download high-res

    for smart irrigation. Artificial intelligence in smart irrigation AI refers to
    the ability of machines to learn and make decisions based on data [58]. AI plays
    a pivotal role in smart irrigation systems, enabling advanced analytics and decision-making
    capabilities [59]. AI algorithms can be used to analyze data on weather, soil
    moisture, and crop water requirements and to make automated decisions on irrigation
    scheduling [60]. This can improve the accuracy and efficiency of irrigation management
    and reduce the risk of over- or under-irrigation. AI enables farmers to collect,
    analyze, and interpret data on a large scale, allowing for more precise and accurate
    irrigation decisions [61]. AI can analyze large amounts of data and provide insights
    that can be used to optimize irrigation. For example, AI can analyze data on soil
    moisture levels, temperature, humidity, and crop growth patterns to identify the
    most efficient irrigation strategies for specific crops and soil types. Fig. 7

    image Fig. 7. Integration of AI in Smart Irrigation. Predictive modelling for
    water demand and crop yield AI-based predictive models for example neural networks,
    ensemble, regression, classification, and time series forecasting models are utilized
    to forecast water demand and crop yield based on historical data and environmental
    factors (Kuradusenge et al., 2023; [45]). Such models use historical data, weather
    patterns, and crop-specific information to estimate the irrigation requirements,
    facilitating efficient water allocation. Kuradusenge et al. (2023) used rainfall
    and temperature data analyzed through Random Forest, Polynomial Regression, and
    Support Vector Regressor to predict crop yield of Irish potato and maize. Random
    forest was recommended for early crop yield prediction of potatoes and maize (Kuradusenge
    et al., 2023). AI algorithms are employed to analyze real-time data from soil
    moisture sensors and determine the optimal irrigation timing and volume [62].
    By continuously monitoring soil moisture levels, smart irrigation systems can
    ensure that crops receive adequate water while avoiding waterlogging and excessive
    runoff [63]. One example of the application of soil moisture monitoring and management
    in sub-Saharan Africa is a study done by (Wanyama et al., 2023). The authors have
    developed a cost-effective green technology intelligent irrigation control system
    kit that improves precise irrigation water application. This kit is a photovoltaic
    system that powers a water pump, a soil moisture sensor, and an Arduino microcontroller
    unit mounted on a moving frame. The soil moisture sensors were placed in the field
    and sent real-time soil moisture values to the microcontroller via a wired Universal
    Serial Bus (USB) communication channel. The microcontroller connected the water
    pump, the tank water level sensor, the soil moisture sensors, and the water tank
    outlet solenoid valve. Therefore, the system could schedule irrigation thus improving
    the traditional irrigation technology. Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are employed
    in smart irrigation systems to analyze data patterns, make predictions, and optimize
    irrigation [64], [65], [66], [67]. ML algorithms learn from historical and real-time
    data, enabling adaptive decision-making and improving irrigation efficiency [68].
    Machine Learning algorithms can analyze historical data on weather, soil conditions,
    and crop performance to predict future irrigation requirements [62]. By providing
    accurate forecasts, ML-based predictive analytics support farmers in making informed
    decisions regarding irrigation scheduling, water allocation, and crop management.
    ML algorithms can be utilized to develop adaptive irrigation control systems that
    adjust irrigation parameters based on real-time data inputs [69,70]. These systems
    continuously monitor soil moisture levels, weather conditions, and plant water
    stress, allowing for dynamic irrigation control to optimize water use efficiency
    and crop productivity. The synergy between AI and smart irrigation is transformative,
    offering data-driven insights and automation for efficient water management. AI
    processes copious data from sensors, weather forecasts, and soil conditions to
    optimize irrigation schedules. ML models are trained on historical data and environmental
    cues to predict crop water requirements. Table 3 summarizes other applications
    using AI in irrigation operations. In another study, Ikudayisi et al. [71] conducted
    research focused on managing crop water requirements at the Winterton irrigation
    scheme in South Africa, aiming to address the challenges posed by water scarcity
    and its impact on agricultural efficiency. To achieve their objectives, the researchers
    employed a combined approach involving artificial intelligence, namely an artificial
    neural network (ANN), and a crop growth simulation model. The study aimed to estimate
    various aspects of crop irrigation water requirements, including the crop-water
    demand from planting to harvest, the timing of irrigation, the optimal stage in
    the drying cycle for water application, and the volume of irrigation water to
    be applied. Five feed-forward backward propagation ANN predictive models with
    varying configurations were developed and assessed. The optimal ANN model, characterized
    by 5 inputs, 5 neurons, 1 hidden layer, and 1 output, was employed to predict
    monthly reference evapotranspiration (ETo) in the Winterton region. This optimal
    ANN model demonstrated a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.67, a Pearson correlation
    coefficient (r) of 0.97, and a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.94. The
    validation of the model revealed a correlation (r) value of 0.9048 between the
    measured and predicted ETo values. Table 3 summarizes other applications using
    AI in irrigation operations. Table 2 Table 2. Artificial intelligence applications

    Things in smart irrigation IoT refers to the network of devices, sensors, and
    machines that are connected to the internet and can exchange data with each other
    [77]. In smart irrigation systems, IoT devices such as sensors and controllers
    can be used to collect and transmit data on weather, soil moisture, and crop water
    requirements. This data can be processed and analyzed in real-time to adjust irrigation
    schedules and optimize water use. IoT plays a crucial role in collecting and transmitting
    data in smart irrigation systems [78,79]. IoT sensors and devices are deployed
    throughout the irrigation infrastructure to monitor various parameters and facilitate
    data-driven decision-making. connectivity. In IoT applications, connectivity between
    gateways, remote clouds, and users is typically over broadband communication networks.
    However, in most of sub-Saharan Africa''s rural countries, broadband connectivity
    is either very expensive or non-existent. Affordable broadband technologies like
    TVWS have been tested in South Africa and around the world and can provide both
    backhaul and last-mile wireless connectivity for remotely deployed agricultural
    IoT-based systems in various locations [80] Data generation and collection through
    IoT sensors IoT sensors, such as soil moisture sensors, weather stations, and
    flow meters, collect real-time data on soil moisture, temperature, humidity, rainfall,
    and water flow [81,82]. These sensors provide a continuous stream of information,
    enabling farmers to make informed decisions regarding irrigation management. Nigussie
    et al. (2020) proposed an IoT-based irrigation management system for smallholder
    farmers in South Africa, Kenya, and Ethiopia`s rural areas. Sensors in the system
    detect soil conditions (moisture, temperature, nutrients, and pH) and provide
    data on the water level in the storage as well as microclimate conditions. The
    actuators in this system direct the flow of water to the farm via sprinklers,
    pumps, valves, and water gates. The IoT network connectivity technology used in
    this system was Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN). This is because LoRaWAN
    is a fully open standard solution with no subscription fee, making it less expensive
    for IoT connectivity devices, and it is well-suited for long-distance. Cloud computing
    for data management and analysis Cloud computing has emerged as a revolutionary
    technology that can transform the way we manage and optimize irrigation systems.
    Cloud computing platforms are utilized to store and process the vast amount of
    data generated by IoT sensors in smart irrigation systems [83]. Cloud-based solutions
    provide scalable storage, computational power, and data analytics capabilities,
    allowing for efficient data management and analysis, [84]. One of the key benefits
    of cloud computing in smart irrigation is the ability to store and process large
    amounts of data in a centralized location. This allows farmers to easily access
    and analyze data on things like soil moisture levels, weather patterns, and crop
    health, which can help them make more informed decisions about irrigation. With
    data driven irrigation optimization, farmers can reduce water waste and ensure
    that water is used only when and where it is needed, leading to improved water
    use efficiency. In sub-Saharan Africa, cloud services create additional running
    costs for irrigation management systems. To address these issues, the most commonly
    proposed IoT architectures typically provide local processing and storage in gateways
    created for data processing, network management, irrigation decisions, and communication
    with farmers. This avoids the need for broadband networks and cloud services (backend
    servers) [80]. Maitethia et al. [85] executed a groundbreaking IoT smart irrigation
    system in Kenya, setting a remarkable precedent for precision agriculture in Africa.
    By integrating a network of sensors, weather stations, and cloud-based analytics,
    their pioneering initiative ushered in a new era of data-driven irrigation management.
    The remarkable outcomes encompassed substantial crop yield improvements, significant
    water conservation, substantial cost reductions, and enhanced climate resilience,
    ultimately bolstering food security and elevating the socioeconomic status of
    local farmers. Although initial investments and the need for comprehensive technical
    training posed initial challenges, the unparalleled potential of IoT-driven smart
    irrigation holds the promise of fostering a sustainable and prosperous future
    for African agriculture. Table 4 presents other applications of IoT in irrigation.
    Big data technology in smart irrigation Big Data Technology plays a significant
    role in unlocking the potential of data in smart irrigation systems [94]. By harnessing
    large volumes of data, valuable insights can be gained to optimize irrigation
    management practices. Big data analytics involves the use of advanced analytical
    techniques to extract insights from large and complex datasets. In smart irrigation
    systems, big data analytics can be used to analyze data on weather, soil moisture,
    and crop water requirements and to identify patterns and trends that can inform
    irrigation management. Big data refers to large and complex data sets that cannot
    be processed using traditional data processing techniques. In the context of precision
    irrigation, big data can be used to analyze large volumes of data on weather patterns,
    soil moisture levels, crop water requirements, and other factors that affect irrigation
    needs. Big Data analytics techniques are applied to historical and real-time data
    to identify patterns, trends, and correlations related to irrigation and crop
    performance [95]. This enables farmers to make data-driven decisions regarding
    irrigation scheduling, water allocation, and crop management. Rabhi et al. [96]
    explored the application of big data analytics in the context of smart irrigation,
    with a specific focus on digital agriculture in Morocco. Their research aimed
    to leverage big data analytics to enhance predictive irrigation techniques. They
    noted the growing importance of intelligent agriculture, characterized by widespread
    adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) analysis solutions, which has led to more
    precise irrigation scheduling. The research took place utilizing an irrigation
    dataset that considered moisture and temperature factors. To analyze this dataset,
    the authors employed neural network (NN) and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms.
    The computational aspect of their study was conducted using the big data platform
    \"databricks,\" which implements the Spark framework for processing large datasets.
    The results from their models were promising, with SVM achieving an accuracy of
    97.00 % and NN reaching an accuracy of 98.50 %. In their future work, the authors
    intend to expand upon the 19,440 enterprise metamodel, introducing additional
    constructs related to advanced technologies such as big data analytics tools,
    IoT, AI, cloud computing, and machine learning. This extended metamodel is envisioned
    to be applied in the context of a smart farm, aligning with the principles of
    Agriculture 4.0. The use of Big Data in smart irrigation systems raises concerns
    about data privacy and security [97]. Safeguarding sensitive information and ensuring
    secure data transmission and storage are essential to maintain trust and protect
    the integrity of smart irrigation systems. Blockchain technology for managing
    big data in irrigation Blockchain technology offers a decentralized and transparent
    framework for managing and securing data in smart irrigation systems [95]. It
    provides an immutable ledger that records and verifies data transactions, ensuring
    data integrity and enabling trusted collaborations. Blockchain technology offers
    a decentralized and transparent framework for managing and securing data in smart
    irrigation systems [98]. By leveraging Blockchain, data can be stored and managed
    in a distributed manner across multiple nodes, eliminating the need for a central
    authority [99]. In smart irrigation, Blockchain can provide an immutable ledger
    that records and verifies data transactions related to water usage, irrigation
    practices, and resource management. Each data transaction is cryptographically
    linked to the previous transaction, creating a chain of blocks that ensures data
    integrity and transparency. By utilizing Blockchain for data management, smart
    irrigation systems can enhance trust and accountability in water governance [100].
    All stakeholders, including farmers, water authorities, and researchers, can access
    and verify the data recorded on the Blockchain, enabling transparent and auditable
    irrigation practices. The decentralized nature of Blockchain also mitigates the
    risks of data tampering and unauthorized modifications. Since data is stored across
    multiple nodes in the network, any attempt to alter the data would require consensus
    from a majority of nodes, making it highly secure and resistant to fraud or manipulation
    [101,102]. Moreover, Blockchain can facilitate trusted collaborations and data
    sharing among stakeholders in the irrigation ecosystem. Smart contracts, which
    are self-executing agreements coded on the Blockchain, can automate and enforce
    rules and conditions related to water allocation, usage rights, and payment systems
    [103]. These smart contracts enhance transparency and efficiency in irrigation
    governance, reducing the reliance on intermediaries and streamlining administrative
    processes. However, the adoption of Blockchain in smart irrigation systems comes
    with challenges. The scalability and energy consumption of Blockchain networks,
    especially in resource-constrained environments, need to be addressed. Additionally,
    ensuring data privacy while maintaining transparency is crucial, as sensitive
    information may be recorded on the Blockchain. Despite these challenges, Blockchain
    technology shows promising potential in revolutionizing data management and governance
    in smart irrigation systems. Further research and pilot projects are needed to
    explore the practical implementation and scalability of Blockchain solutions in
    the context of sub-Saharan Africa. Blockchain''s smart contract functionality
    can be leveraged to automate and enforce irrigation governance rules [104]. Smart
    contracts enable the execution of predefined rules and conditions related to water
    allocation, usage rights, and payment systems. This enhances transparency, reduces
    disputes, and ensures fair and accountable irrigation practices. Drone technology
    in smart irrigation Drone technology has emerged as a promising tool for enhancing
    smart irrigation practices in various agricultural contexts. Drones, also known
    as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), offer unique capabilities for remote sensing,
    high-resolution data collection, and precision irrigation management. Drones equipped
    with advanced sensors and imaging systems enable remote sensing and high-resolution
    data collection in agricultural landscapes [105,103,106]. These sensors capture
    data on various parameters, including soil moisture, vegetation indices, temperature,
    and crop health. The collected data provides valuable insights into the spatial
    variability of soil and crop conditions, allowing for targeted irrigation interventions.
    In Kenya, certain farmers have embraced innovative approaches such as employing
    near-infrared cameras affixed to drones for pest and disease identification, among
    other applications. Additionally, within the Kenyan context, there exists a beta-stage
    AI tool named Nuru, accessible on Android devices with or without internet connectivity
    [107]. This advanced technology specializes in the diagnosis of crop diseases,
    with a particular focus on identifying mite and viral infections in cassava and
    detecting armyworm infestations in maize. KDHI Agriculture reports that a substantial
    number of cassava farmers, approximately 28,000, have already reaped the benefits
    of this tool''s implementation. One of the key applications of drone technology
    in smart irrigation is the monitoring of soil moisture levels [108]. Drones equipped
    with specialized sensors can capture near infrared and thermal imagery to assess
    soil moisture content across fields. This information helps farmers understand
    the spatial distribution of moisture and make informed decisions on irrigation
    scheduling and water allocation. In addition to monitoring soil moisture, drones
    can assess crop health and water use efficiency through multispectral and thermal
    imaging [109,108]. By analyzing vegetation indices and thermal patterns, drones
    can identify areas of stress, disease outbreaks, or water stress in crops. This
    data aids in targeted irrigation interventions, optimizing water use, and maximizing
    crop productivity. Drone technology enables precision irrigation by providing
    real-time and site-specific information for irrigation management [110]. With
    the collected data on soil moisture, crop health, and water use efficiency, farmers
    can determine the optimal irrigation needs of different areas within a field.
    This enables precise water application, minimizing water wastage and ensuring
    efficient water use. Constraints in leveraging 4IR technologies for smart irrigation

    academia, research institutions, and extension services can facilitate knowledge
    transfer and skill development, addressing the capacity gaps and promoting the
    effective use of 4IR technologies in smart irrigation practices. Integration with
    existing agricultural practices Integrating drone technology into existing agricultural
    practices requires farmers to adapt their workflows and decision-making processes
    [119,97]. Farmers need to understand how to interpret drone-generated data and
    incorporate it into their irrigation management strategies. Extension services
    and farmer-to-farmer knowledge sharing platforms play a crucial role in facilitating
    this integration. Opportunities for leveraging 4IR technologies in smart irrigation
    Enhanced water use efficiency and crop yield optimization Leveraging 4IR technologies
    in smart irrigation presents significant opportunities for enhancing water use
    efficiency and optimizing crop yields [121,122]. Through the integration of sensors,
    AI algorithms, and real-time data monitoring, smart irrigation systems can precisely
    assess soil moisture levels, weather conditions, and crop water requirements.
    This data-driven approach enables farmers to apply water resources more efficiently,
    minimizing water wastage and maximizing crop productivity. By ensuring that irrigation
    is tailored to the specific needs of crops and adapting to changing environmental
    conditions, 4IR technologies can significantly contribute to sustainable water
    management and improved agricultural outcomes. Data-driven decision-making for
    improved irrigation practices The use of 4IR technologies in smart irrigation
    facilitates data-driven decision-making processes, enabling farmers to make informed
    choices regarding irrigation practices [121]. By collecting and analyzing large
    volumes of data from various sources, such as sensors, satellites, and weather
    stations, smart irrigation systems provide valuable insights into soil conditions,
    crop water requirements, and irrigation scheduling. This wealth of information
    empowers farmers to optimize irrigation strategies, adjust watering schedules,
    and apply the right amount of water at the right time, leading to improved water
    management and increased crop productivity. Data-driven decision-making also allows
    for proactive responses to changing climate patterns and helps mitigate the risks
    associated with water scarcity and climate variability. Precision irrigation and
    resource conservation Precision irrigation, made possible by 4IR technologies,
    offers the opportunity to precisely target water delivery to crops, thereby conserving
    water resources [121]. By utilizing data from sensors, drones, and satellite imagery,
    smart irrigation systems can identify variations in soil moisture levels, plant
    water stress, and water availability across different areas of the field. This
    information enables farmers to implement site-specific irrigation, providing water
    precisely where and when it is needed. As a result, water wastage is minimized,
    and the overall water use efficiency is significantly improved. Precision irrigation
    also contributes to reducing nutrient leaching, minimizing soil erosion, and optimizing
    fertilizer application, leading to more sustainable agricultural practices. Empowering
    smallholder farmers and rural communities 4IR technologies have the potential
    to empower smallholder farmers and rural communities by democratizing access to
    information, resources, and market opportunities [123]. Through the use of mobile
    applications, remote sensing, and digital platforms, farmers can access real-time
    data on weather conditions, market prices, and best agricultural practices [124].
    This information enables them to make informed decisions, improve productivity,
    and increase their income. Additionally, 4IR technologies facilitate the integration
    of smallholder farmers into agricultural value chains, connecting them with buyers,
    financial services, and extension services. This enhanced connectivity and access
    to markets can contribute to poverty alleviation, economic growth, and the overall
    development of rural communities. Prospects of fourth industrial revolution technologies
    for smart irrigation in sub-Saharan Africa Scaling up adoption of 4IR technologies
    in smart irrigation To fully harness the potential of Fourth Industrial Revolution
    technologies in smart irrigation, it is crucial to scale up their adoption across

  description: The current era witnesses the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT),
    a transformative force giving rise to various technological innovations, most
    notably connected objects. This paradigm shift catalyzes the widespread adoption
    of autonomous decision-making systems, particularly in sectors like agriculture,
    where the aim is to amplify productivity. As a result of the agricultural domain,
    mushrooms have concurrently emerged as a significant component of daily diets,
    offering additional vitamins and flavor. Despite their popularity, cultivating
    mushrooms in open environments poses challenges in maintaining optimal environmental
    conditions, prompting numerous research efforts. Recognizing the inconsistencies
    in existing approaches to safeguard vital parameters in mushroom farms, this paper
    introduces an innovative system utilizing intelligent sensors whose real-time
    records are managed based on the fuzzy sets concept. These sensors, encompassing
    the Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor v1.2, DHT22 Sensor, Light Dependent Resistor
    (LDR sensor), and Passive Infrared Receiver (PIR sensor), collectively capture
    essential data for decision-making in mushroom farming. Employing fuzzy logic,
    the system addresses pivotal aspects such as substrate watering, environmental
    control, light management, and pest detection. Through experimental results, it
    becomes evident that the proposed system not only exemplifies the potential of
    IoT technologies in agriculture but also offers a comprehensive and efficient
    approach to real-time decision-making. By aggregating sensor data, the system
    proves instrumental in enhancing the quality and yield of mushroom crops, showcasing
    a promising trajectory for sustainable and technologically driven agricultural
    practices.

  explanation: 'The proposed system uses an IoT-based method which integrates fuzzy
    logic (FL) along with various sensors for gathering data. The gathered information
    is employed to intelligently control vital environmental parameters necessary
    for mushroom growth, like humidity, light, and temperature. The system''s behavior
    is defined by a series of pre-programmed rules that determine how the actuators
    in the system respond based on sensor inputs.


    The proposed system offers a number of advantages over existing approaches to
    mushroom cultivation. By utilizing IoT and FL, the system can provide real-time
    monitoring and control of environmental parameters. This enables precise adjustments
    to be made based on the specific needs of the mushrooms, resulting in optimal
    growing conditions. Additionally, the integration of sensors allows for automated
    data collection and analysis, which can help farmers to identify trends and make
    informed decisions about their cultivation practices.


    Overall, the proposed system represents a significant advancement in the field
    of mushroom cultivation. It offers a comprehensive and automated approach to environmental
    control that can help to improve yields and reduce risks. The system is also scalable,
    making it suitable for both small and large-scale mushroom farms.'

    utilizing intelligent sensors whose real-time records are managed based on the
    fuzzy sets concept. These sensors, encompassing the Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor
    v1.2, DHT22 Sensor, Light Dependent Resistor (LDR sensor), and Passive Infrared
    Receiver (PIR sensor), collectively capture essential data for decision-making
    in mushroom farming. Employing fuzzy logic, the system addresses pivotal aspects
    such as substrate watering, environmental control, light management, and pest
    detection. Through experimental results, it becomes evident that the proposed
    system not only exemplifies the potential of IoT technologies in agriculture but
    also offers a comprehensive and efficient approach to real-time decision-making.
    By aggregating sensor data, the system proves instrumental in enhancing the quality
    and yield of mushroom crops, showcasing a promising trajectory for sustainable
    and technologically driven agricultural practices. Previous article in issue Next

    farmingFuzzy logicNational food security 1. Introduction Agriculture poses a significant
    concern for humanity, as it is the primary source of food production. Many individuals
    suffer from hunger due to food scarcity, particularly in Third-world countries
    [22]. Food scarcity has been associated with socioeconomic elements like the expanding
    population [48]. Over the last five decades, the global population has risen by
    3–6 billion, intensifying the demand for food resources [5,35]. Shockingly, hunger
    led to the chronic malnourishment of over 800 million people worldwide in 2016.
    Furthermore, more than 10 million individuals perish annually due to starvation
    [14]. Therefore, increasing food production is crucial in eradicating hunger and
    poverty. However, the reality is far from simple; agriculture remains largely
    unmodernized in many countries, leading to low food output [44]. Due to this necessity,
    there is a requirement for the advancement of intelligent agriculture by enhancing
    farming methods beyond conventional practices, which is crucial to boosting production
    yields qualitatively. This necessitates integrating constantly evolving technological
    innovations [49]. Its purpose is to empower farming methods to match agricultural
    production with the increasing population, thereby reducing prevalent hunger [2].
    The global rise in mushroom cultivation can be attributed to the nutritional richness
    and distinctive culinary characteristics of mushrooms [50]. There is a forecast
    that the worldwide mushroom market will achieve a volume of 24.05 million tons
    by 2028 [21]. Regrettably, mushrooms have not garnered significant interest among
    farmers due to the high labor requirement during the practice. Additionally, cultivating
    specific mushroom varieties poses challenges, especially in regions where wild
    mushroom cultivation is prevalent [17]. Unlike most agricultural species, mushrooms
    must be cultivated in a specific environment, avoiding high temperatures and low
    humidity to achieve the most favorable harvest [[18], [19]]. Historically, mushrooms
    have been naturally grown in the wild and harvested from their natural habitats
    [36], affecting the harvest of this crucial agricultural product. Over the past
    ten years, the Internet of Things (IoT) has become a crucial tool across various
    domains [53]. Specifically in agriculture, IoT is employed to create interconnected
    farming systems that optimize productivity while conserving resources [26]. This
    advanced technology enables farmers to enhance agricultural productivity sustainably
    with reduced environmental risks [31,47]. Through the deep integration of state-of-the-art
    technologies such as deep learning, artificial intelligence, IoT, and cloud computing,
    smart agriculture represents a strategic approach for the agricultural sector
    to autonomously monitor, control, and make informed decisions with the assistance
    of information and knowledge [1,4,39]. This integration is achieved through the
    deployment of IoT sensors in agricultural practices. This proves particularly
    beneficial in agricultural activities, especially for crops that demand extra
    care during cultivation, such as mushrooms. Numerous research endeavors have explored
    mushroom cultivation by incorporating various intelligent systems, primarily concentrating
    on regulating temperature and air humidity through automated watering systems
    [32]. Nevertheless, other crucial factors remain overlooked in mushroom plant
    cultivation, such as managing light exposure [23], addressing insect disruptions
    [9] and utilizing natural or artificial lights a crucial environmental factor
    that significantly enhances the quality of edible mushrooms before and after harvest
    [24,27,33,54]. These factors play a vital role in the growth and metabolism of
    mushrooms, influencing mycelium characteristics (growth rate, density, and color)
    and the physical appearance of fruiting bodies (stalk, cap, and color formation)
    [23]. It is worth clarifying that light plays a major role in the cultivation
    of edible mushrooms [52]. Moreover, the research work of Bellettini et al. [8]
    focused on the identification of the presence of insects, mites, crustaceans,
    and other arthropods that feed on mushrooms, as well as decomposers on synthetic
    or wooden substrates, as detrimental factors to the optimal growth of mushrooms.
    It is worth noting that Bellettini et al. [8] presented a challenge of manually
    addressing the issues of external agent''s presence, which can be mitigated by
    automatically spraying the pesticide on the farm. To alleviate the challenges
    with the current mushroom production, this study aims to provide an IoT-based
    system that integrates various modules to intelligently control vital parameters:
    temperature, humidity, substrate moisture, light intensity, and pest management.
    The proposed method integrates Fuzzy Logic (FL) in the IoT module to enable the
    sensor-recorded data use as enablers of the system functionality based on their
    comparison with the pre-recorded standard data, specifying optimal ranges for
    each vital parameter. The system triggers actuators when sensor data falls outside
    the desired range to keep the environmental parameters of the farm in the desired
    range, effective for mushroom cultivation. It is important to note that the proposed
    method incorporates self-decision-making through FL, a mathematical modeling technique
    mimicking human decision-making. To achieve our objectives, the contributions
    of this work are highlighted as follows: 1. Monitoring the sensors'' recorded
    data for an intelligent and adaptive environment, ensuring optimal conditions
    for mushroom cultivation, and automating the farm''s vital environmental parameters.
    2. Optimizing agricultural resources, namely, water and pesticide, by introducing
    the sensors not used in the previous works. Keeping the objective of this work
    under the mushroom cultivation field, the diversification of our method leads
    to a more nuanced understanding of the environmental factors that can be applied
    to several types of mushrooms. The structure of this paper is outlined as follows:
    In Section 2, the literature review and the current state of the art about the
    focal point of this study are presented. Section 3 outlines the design and methodology
    employed in this work. The results are deliberated in Section 4, with concluding
    remarks provided in the last Section 5. 2. Literature review and materials 2.1.
    Existing literature Intelligent environmental control applications have successfully
    enhanced agricultural applications, particularly in mushroom farming research.
    The research works in Jararweh et al. [28] employed FL connected to various actuators,
    which have been adjusted based on the data gathered during the process. The results
    obtained by Jararweh et al. [28] showed significant improvement over the existing
    works. However, optimal farm control has not been achieved. The study by Chandrappa
    et al. [12] focused on using sensor automation technology to aid farmers in making
    manual and automatic agricultural decisions. However, these efforts mainly concentrated
    on monitoring moisture content in the substrate, air temperature, and humidity
    in the mushroom field, ignoring other crucial parameters that may impact the quality
    and quantity of the mushroom yield. Factors such as cultivation techniques, mechanical
    damage, storage conditions, and post-harvest manipulation also play a significant
    role [11,40]. It is worth noting that the integration of FL in agricultural applications
    [13,29,30,42] has been proven to be one of the most efficient techniques to control
    the variation of the farms’ parameters based on the classification of the data
    in place classification in various sets. The introduction of IoT in agricultural
    applications has also shown promising improvement in crop production, such as
    in Marzuk and Ying [34] and Thong-u and Wongsaroj [45]. Specifically, the work
    by Thong-un and Wongsaroj [45] conducted across three mushroom fields and one
    adjacent sample area, employing wireless communication to merge the data from
    these fields utilized the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol
    to centralize information from each field, which was then uploaded to an online
    platform. Similarly, Marzuki and Ying [34] utilized an online interface for real-time
    monitoring. However, their approach involved a more comprehensive array of sensors,
    measuring additional parameters such as air temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide
    levels, and light quality. They used ThingSpeak as a cloud platform connected
    to the web-based visualization window. Moreover, the work of Rahman et al. [38]
    automated agricultural decisions and executed the process according to fixed time
    interval-based schedules. 2.2. The state-of-the-art Edible mushrooms are highly
    prized for their nutritional and medicinal properties, thanks to the presence
    of diverse bioactive elements, including proteins, polyunsaturated fatty acids,
    polysaccharides, dietary fibres, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals, making them
    a valuable food resource [3]. Due to their nutritional and medicinal advantages,
    mushrooms have gained widespread popularity worldwide in recent years. Global
    mushroom production has jumped 21.3 times since 1990, reaching 44 million tons
    in 2021 [7]. Various research works have predicted that the worldwide mushroom
    market will achieve a volume of 24.05 million tons by 2028 [21]. These statistics
    demonstrate that mushrooms are a natural resource experiencing growing demand
    annually. Considering this information, various cultivation methods have been
    created by preserving traditional practices or incorporating technological advancements.
    Some research has shown that implementing innovative cultivation techniques in
    mushroom farming can boost production to meet the annual demand figures. The significance
    of mushrooms in sustaining human life is underscored in earlier sections, emphasizing
    the role of technology in enhancing agricultural productivity and highlighting
    the importance of technology, particularly the IoT, as a solution to enhance efficiency
    in agriculture, leading to the development of intelligent crop production systems.
    This study applies IoT to intelligently monitor the substrate for mushroom cultivation
    based on the features of existing works, such as sensor integration, digital data
    transmission, and wireless sensor networks. These technologies enable diverse
    devices, fostering IoT implementation in agriculture. Intelligent irrigation,
    optimized fertilizer usage, pest control, and water and soil quality monitoring
    are among the practices benefiting from IoT applications [41]. Wireless Sensor
    Networks facilitate crop monitoring and intelligent agricultural applications
    by enabling long-distance communication and enhancing energy efficiency [51].
    Monitoring technologies within IoT solutions play a crucial role in ensuring food
    safety and quality. Furthermore, IoT-based solutions establish information networks
    for effective decision-making and product management for crops and the entire
    agricultural supply chain. Integrating networks, sensors, and data processing
    offers water-use solutions, especially in regions with limited water resources.
    This leads to water conservation and food security. IoT technology also provides
    real-time information, reduces labor, enhances productivity in planting activities,
    and promotes efficient water usage. Furthermore, the impact of this information
    extends to the utilization of lighting, pumps, and agricultural machinery [41].
    FL is an approach to reasoning that relies on approximations and assumptions,
    mirroring human thought processes. FL-based algorithms have extensive applications
    in areas like data hiding based on adaptability [17,46], automation of production
    lines [37], and digital images forensics with steganalysis [15,16]. FL represents
    an improvement over Boolean logic by introducing the concept of partial truth
    [45]. FL, on the other hand, incorporates the highest Boolean logic value with
    a degree of truth ranging between 0 and 1. One of the critical advantages of FL
    is its departure from classical logic, enabling the direct utilization of expert
    knowledge without the need for extensive training. It also integrates seamlessly
    with conventional control methods rooted in natural language [10]. It is crucial
    to note that FL is known for its superior energy efficiency compared to classical
    logic [6]. Applying FL, which involves setting a threshold value for the desired
    parameter unit to regulate the environmental factors in agricultural crop cultivation,
    specific parameters are defined as reference points for the implementation and
    tailored to the individual sensors utilized in the test area. Typically, FL is
    integrated into agricultural machinery automation systems to administer treatments
    based on the derived decisions. Based on the in-depth analysis, this research
    proposes a new IoT-based smart system using FL to manage the environmental parameters
    of the mushroom cultivation substrate. The proposed system incorporates sensors
    such as light intensity and infrared sensors to gather more comprehensive information
    aligning with the specific needs of mushroom plants to regulate parameters like
    lighting levels and manage the presence of insects, which significantly affect
    mushroom production. 3. Methodology This section outlines the overall approach
    and fundamental principles of the model under consideration. It comprises five
    crucial subsections that detail the proposed system''s important features. In
    this article, we employ FL to self-regulate the vital parameters within the mushroom
    substrate to improve the existing methods based on traditional human-controlled
    methods. 3.1. Workflow overview of the proposed model This subsection provides
    comprehensive details of the proposed model''s workflow in Fig. 1. The proposed
    model mainly comprises sensors, actuators, and cloud components. It is worth noting
    that the proposed model delves into a detailed examination of the various modules
    employed, elucidating their contributions to the overall functionality of the
    proposed method. Download : Download high-res image (351KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 1. Comprehensive architecture of the proposed method. The
    system is crafted using two microcontrollers, with the primary microcontroller,
    NodeMCU ESP8266, serving as the central hub for data acquisition and embedded
    FL control. Simultaneously, the secondary microcontroller, Arduino UNO, is dedicated
    to disseminating information to farmers through a web-based platform. Additionally,
    specific sensors tailored to the environmental control needs of mushroom plants
    have been chosen. These sensors are connected to the main microcontroller, which
    reads and processes data. The gathered data are compiled into data packets before
    being transmitted and then uploaded to a digital platform. The schematic circuit
    for the designed system is illustrated in Fig. 2. As previously described, the
    main microcontroller incorporates FL to autonomously determine the treatment and
    decision-making in managing the environmental control process. The user can control
    all these parameters based on the real-time data recorded concerning the soil
    moisture, temperature, humidity and light intensity. Download : Download high-res
    image (352KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Circuit diagram of the
    proposed method. 3.2. Data collection To collect the data, this work uses the
    sensor unit. The sensors unit comprises dedicated sensors designed to focus on
    specific parameters established as references in this work. These sensors encompass
    a soil moisture meter, a light sensor for measuring light intensity levels, a
    temperature and humidity measuring sensor for recording ambient temperature and
    humidity, and a motion detection sensor. Calibration has been conducted on all
    sensors to avoid acquiring irrelevant data values that could result in irregularities
    during the operational process. 3.2.1. Soil moisture sensing The chosen sensor
    for measuring soil moisture content is the Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor v1.2.
    This selection is based on its capability to measure soil moisture levels using
    capacitive sensing. Constructed with corrosion-resistant materials and coated
    with a layer of PCB paint, this sensor offers an extended service life and an
    aesthetically pleasing appearance. Its operation involves measuring changes in
    capacitance resulting from variations in soil electrolyte content. With an operating
    voltage range of approximately 3.3 to 5.5 V, the sensor is well-suited for application
    with microcontrollers that typically output low voltages, such as 3.3 V or 5 V,
    as used in this work. 3.2.2. Light intensity sensing This work employs a module-based
    Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) to measure light intensity levels. The rationale
    behind selecting this module is the work''s preference for output in the form
    of an analog value regarding light intensity levels, and this module is more straightforward
    to implement. As its name implies, this sensor relies on a resistor whose resistance
    value can vary based on the received light levels. This module operates at a compatible
    voltage, making it suitable for integration into this project. The module can
    capture light intensity levels ranging from 0.1 to 10,000 lux. On the other hand,
    this sensor''s resistance value spans 0.1 to 1000 kΩ. Additionally, it can function
    within a temperature range of −60 to 75 Celsius, aligning with the optimal temperature
    and humidity conditions for mushrooms, maintaining elevated humidity levels and
    lower temperature levels. 3.2.3. Temperature and humidity sensing The optimal
    temperature required for mushroom cultivation ranges from 22 to 28 Celsius, while
    the optimal air humidity ranges from 80 % to 90 % [38]. Therefore, the DHT22 sensor
    is employed to measure the air temperature and humidity levels. Its use of a calibrated
    digital signal output enhances its effectiveness. Moreover, its low voltage requirement
    underscores the sensor''s suitability, operating within the 3.3 to 6 V DC range.
    The sensor exhibits a measurement range of 0–100 % for air humidity, with an accuracy
    of +-2 %, and −40 to 80 Celsius for temperature, with an accuracy of 0.5 degrees
    Celsius difference. Notably, the sensor demonstrates responsive performance, boasting
    an average sensing period of 2 s. These attributes make the DHT22 sensor a promising
    choice for implementing intelligent agricultural environmental control processes.
    3.2.4. Motion detection sensing Detecting the presence of insects is a crucial
    consideration in all stages of crop cultivation. Farmers can identify the presence
    of insects using a sensor known as the Passive Infrared Receiver (PIR), with the
    HC-SR501 PIR sensor specifically employed in this work. This module detects the
    levels of infrared radiation the embedded pyroelectric module receives. The sensor
    exhibits noteworthy sensitivity, featuring an adjustable sensitivity range and
    a detection area angle of approximately 110 degrees from the sensor knob. Moreover,
    it can detect movement between 3 and 7 m perpendicularly. Despite its capabilities,
    the sensor is power-efficient, requiring only a low power supply within the range
    of 5 to 12 V and accommodating temperatures from −15 to 70 Celsius. These attributes
    make the sensor highly suitable for the requirements of this work. 3.3. Data processing
    The data processing is mainly based on the controlling unit. For the controller
    unit of this study, two microcontrollers are employed, each with distinct roles.
    Both microcontrollers are supplied with a working voltage of 9 V using a power
    supply. This facilitates the implementation of the designed tool, allowing direct
    connection to electricity with a higher voltage range of 220–240 V. The primary
    microcontroller reads and processes data from each sensor, enabling automatic
    decision-making to maintain optimal farm environmental conditions based on the
    implemented FL. The Arduino UNO R3 is the chosen controller for this processing
    task. The selection is based on the specific pin requirements for this project,
    where two analog pins and ten digital pins are necessary. The two analog pins
    are utilized to interface with the Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor and LDR Sensor,
    as the data processing for these sensors rely on acquiring analog values. Additionally,
    the ten digital pins serve various purposes. Two are allocated for connecting
    the DHT22 and PIR sensors, two receivers (RX) and a Transmitter (TX) establish
    communication with other microcontrollers, and the remaining six are designated
    for connecting relays with six channels. Given the inherent incapacity of the
    main microcontroller, Arduino UNO R3, to establish an internet connection, an
    additional microcontroller is employed to facilitate data upload to the internet
    in this work. This component is called NodeMCU ESP8266, featuring an embedded
    ESP8266 WiFi Module chip that enables seamless internet connectivity. By utilizing
    this embedded chip, this module assumes the role of an agent responsible for executing
    the data upload process to the chosen web-based digital platform. Consequently,
    it facilitates the real-time presentation of agricultural land data to farmers.
    3.4. Cloud platform As previously mentioned, using two microcontrollers accommodates
    all acquired sensor data. It facilitates its upload to a web-based digital platform
    named ThingerIO. The data obtained by Arduino UNO R3 is transmitted to NodeMCU
    ESP8266 through serial communication. This communication is established by reverse
    interconnecting each module''s RX and TX pins. On the Arduino UNO microcontroller,
    pin D0 is the RX, and pin D1 is the TX. In contrast, on the NodeMCU ESP8266 microcontroller,
    pin D6 is designated as the RX and D7 as the TX. The data transmission initiates
    with NodeMCU ESP8266 initializing a data request through the serial transmission
    of a specific character to Arduino UNO R3. Subsequently, Arduino UNO R3 continually
    checks for requests at intervals of 2 s. Upon detecting a data request, Arduino
    UNO R3 consolidates the sensor data into a single packet. Then, it transmits it
    to NodeMCU ESP8266 via serial communication. 3.5. System functionality This section
    provides a comprehensive overview of the design and functionality of the proposed
    system. It delves into the intricacies of the system''s architecture, elucidating
    the operation of FL within specified parameter boundaries established in this
    study. Fig. 3 illustrates the system''s overall workflow, outlining the specifics
    of input segmentation derived from various sensors. The process includes a detailed
    examination of microcontrollers and the integration of FL, ultimately resulting
    in automated and intelligent monitoring control. Download : Download high-res
    image (244KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Workflow of the smart
    farming unit. 3.5.1. Data acquisition The Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor is linked
    to pin A0 on the Arduino UNO R3 using analog pins. Consequently, the data displayed
    on the Arduino is initially in the form of raw analog data, which is then transformed
    into a percentage format using the map() function, designating 0 as the lower
    limit and 100 as the upper limit. This conversion results in a final percentage
    value for the Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor within the 0–100 per cent range.
    Similarly, the LDR sensor is connected to pin A2 on the Arduino UNO R3, and its
    initial output is raw analog data. A formula derived from the calibration process
    is applied to convert this value into lux, utilizing the coefficient values obtained
    from a previously conducted linear regression. The × value represents this equation''s
    analog data obtained from the LDR. The DHT22 is linked to pin D4 on the Arduino
    UNO R3 for digital pins. With the assistance of the available library, incorporating
    the DHT22 sensor into the system is a straightforward process. The acquired data
    from the DHT22 sensor provides direct outputs in degrees Celsius for temperature
    and percentage values for humidity. Moving on to the next sensor, PIR, is connected
    to pin D3 on the Arduino UNO R3. In the program, this sensor is designated as
    a digital input value. It is solely utilized to display acquisition data within
    the ``high'''' and ``low'''' value ranges. The other digital pin connects two
    relays, each comprising 4 and 2 channels, with each relay point linked to pins
    D6-D11 on the Arduino UNO R3. In addition, for the power requirements of all the
    modules, this work does not establish a direct connection between the sensors''
    two power pins (GND and VCC) and relays with the power pin on the Arduino UNO
    R3. Instead, these pins are directly linked to the primary 9 V power source obtained
    from the power supply, which has been reduced to a 5 V voltage using a 3296 step-down
    module. 3.5.2. Decision making The actuation decision in the mushroom farm depends
    on the output from the Fuzzy Inference System (FIS). The implementation of Fuzzy
    Logic (FL) is utilized to produce appropriate output based on the given input.
    This study involves five input parameters: soil moisture (Moist), light intensity
    (Light), temperature (Temp), humidity (Hum), and motion detection (Mot). Each
    parameter has a distinct number of memberships based on the specific characteristics
    of the variable it represents. Soil moisture, air temperature, motion detection,
    and humidity typically have three memberships (low, medium, and high) using a
    triangular membership function to capture the varying states relevant to the desired
    ranges. Light intensity is set to have four memberships (very low, low, medium,
    and high) utilizing a trapezoidal membership function, allowing for more nuanced
    categories that align with the specific illumination needs in the mushroom farm.
    For all parameters, the choice of memberships is tailored to the inherent complexities
    and variations of each parameter, enabling the fuzzy logic system to effectively
    model the intricacies of the monitored conditions in applications like smart farming
    or agriculture. In essence, the preference for triangular and trapezoidal membership
    functions arises from their simplicity, ease of interpretation, and ability to
    accurately model the gradual and non-linear transitions inherent in agricultural
    and environmental parameters. While other membership functions like Gaussian,
    bell-shaped, or sigmoidal can be employed, their suitability depends on the specific
    characteristics of the parameters being modeled. Gaussian functions, for instance,
    are adept at representing symmetric and bell-shaped distributions but may not
    be as intuitive for the gradual transitions seen in agriculture. Similarly, bell-shaped
    functions may be suitable for certain parameters with a well-defined peak. However,
    they might not capture the asymmetry found in soil moisture or air temperature
    transitions. Sigmoidal functions, known for gradual transitions, may lack the
    flexibility needed to represent the specific ranges and categories vital in the
    mushroom cultivation context. The choice of triangular and trapezoidal membership
    functions for soil moisture, air temperature, motion detection, humidity, and
    light intensity in the context of mushroom cultivation proves advantageous due
    to their ability to accurately capture the nuanced and dynamic nature of environmental
    conditions. Triangular membership functions are well-suited for parameters like
    soil moisture, air temperature, motion detection, and humidity, as they allow
    for a smooth and gradual transition between low, medium, and high levels. This
    is crucial in representing the continuous and variable characteristics of these
    parameters in mushroom cultivation. Trapezoidal membership functions, on the other
    hand, provide a more flexible and detailed representation, particularly suitable
    for light intensity. In mushroom farming, where lighting conditions are pivotal
    for different growth stages, the trapezoidal function''s additional category allows
    for a more refined categorization of illumination levels. Triangular and trapezoidal
    membership functions offer precision, flexibility, and adaptability, making them
    superior choices for modeling the intricacies of the monitored conditions in smart
    mushroom farming. Drawing on the insights presented in [43], this research introduces
    a three-membership model for soil moisture, aiming to categorize moisture content
    into low, medium, and high ranges. A low soil moisture level (0 % to 30 %) suggests
    drier conditions that may hinder optimal mushroom growth. The medium soil moisture
    category (25 % to 70 %) represents a balanced range conducive to various stages
    of mushroom development. Conversely, high soil moisture (60 % to 100 %) indicates
    excessive wetness, posing challenges such as waterlogging and heightened vulnerability
    to diseases. Extending this methodology to air temperature, a three-membership
    model is applied. Low air temperature (0 °C to 15 °C) signals cooler conditions
    that might slow down mushroom development. The medium air temperature category
    (10 °C to 25 °C) supports diverse growth stages, from mycelium colonization to
    fruiting body formation. Conversely, high air temperature (20 °C to 30 °C) requires
    careful management to avoid heat stress. Furthermore, based on insights from [25],
    a three-membership model is employed for humidity. Low humidity (0 % to 50 %)
    suggests that drier conditions are less favorable for optimal mushroom growth.
    The medium humidity category (40 % to 70 %) represents a balanced range supporting
    various mushroom development stages. Conversely, high humidity (60 % to 100 %)
    indicates excess moisture, posing challenges like increased susceptibility to
    diseases and issues related to waterlogged substrate. Aligning with motion detection
    and light intensity, referenced by Sun et al., low motion detection indicates
    minimal movement, the standard condition during cultivation. Medium motion detection
    suggests occasional disturbances, while high motion detection indicates undesirable
    continuous motion in a controlled mushroom cultivation environment. Finally, regarding
    light intensity, this research employs a four-membership model to define distinct
    illumination levels. Very low light intensity (0 to 500 lux) is suitable for specific
    phases like spore germination. Low light intensity (400 to 1000 lux) caters to
    mycelium growth. Medium-light intensity (800 to 2000 lux) is conducive to various
    growth stages, including fruiting body formation. High light intensity (1500 to
    5000 lux) supports intense lighting conditions beneficial for mushroom maturation.
    The implementation of FL entails connecting the input values gathered from all
    sensors, which are then employed to ascertain the output values following a predefined
    set of rules (see Table 1). To achieve this, a series of if-then rules are devised
    to work in conjunction with the membership function of each parameter. The Mamdani''s
    type is chosen in this work due to its suitability for the proposed approach.
    In this context, the fuzzy output translates into the automation of various paired
    actuators. Table 1. Proposed fuzzy logic rules. IF soil moisture AND air temperature
    AND humidity AND motion detection AND light intensity THEN action Low (0–30 %)

    this FL flow, focusing on how it is optimized. The optimization of fuzzy parameters
    in the proposed model involves a meticulous process tailored to each environmental
    parameter. Soil moisture, air temperature, humidity, motion detection, and light
    intensity are systematically categorized into appropriate membership functions
    and ranges. For soil moisture, a three-membership model is employed, with specific
    ranges such as low moisture (0 % to 30 %) hindering optimal growth and high moisture
    (60 % to 100 %) indicating excess wetness. Air temperature, humidity, and motion
    detection follow similar optimization, aligning temperature and humidity ranges
    with different growth stages. Download : Download high-res image (256KB) Download

    categories reflect the standard and undesirable movement during cultivation. Notably,
    light intensity is optimized with a four-membership model, allowing for precise
    categorization suited to the level of light needed in the mushroom farm. Following
    the data acquisition of these parameters, the subsequent step in the FL workflow
    involves fuzzification. Here, each parameter''s input value is adapted to conform
    with the established FL rules. This fuzzification process occurs within the rule
    evaluation segment, where several fuzzy membership rules are integrated. The outcome
    of this phase undergoes a defuzzification process, resulting in a fuzzy output
    value readable by the device and ready for further management to operate the connected
    actuator. 3.5.3. System monitoring This section details how sensor-acquired data
    becomes immediately accessible to farmers. The Arduino UNO R3 microcontroller
    oversees the data acquisition, packaging the dataset for transmission to the data-uploading
    microcontroller. Following receiving data from the Arduino UNO R3, the NodeMCU
    ESP8266 executes the data upload process to the web-based digital platform. The
    NodeMCU ESP8266 is configured to receive a Service Set Identifier (SSID) connection
    exclusively from a specific access point, as it can only connect to the singular
    SSID designated in the program. An LED indicator signifies a successful internet
    connection for the module. Once the NodeMCU ESP8266 receives the data, the subsequent
    step involves breaking down the data based on the acquisition from each sensor.
    After this breakdown, the data upload process unfolds on the digital platform.
    A deliberate delay is incorporated between each data upload event to prevent the
    potential occurrence of a data upload process deemed spam. The digital platform
    interface uses numeric, gauge, and graphical representations. Numerical and gauge-based
    information is consolidated within one feature, while graphical displays are presented
    separately. Each graph''s x-label provides detailed time information, while the
    y-label indicates specific data acquisition details. The x-label on each graph
    is intentionally designed with varying time intervals. For instance, the graphs
    depicting soil moisture, light intensity, and air humidity display data every
    5 s, while the graph for air temperature is programmed to show data every 30 s.
    This adjustment is made considering the responsiveness of the temperature changes,
    which necessitate a longer time frame compared to other parameters. 4. Result
    and discussion In this section, we present the results obtained and their related
    discussions. It is important to note that the features of the proposed method
    are based on its ability to assess soil moisture, air temperature, air humidity,
    and light intensity and identify the presence of insects. In line with the validation
    of the results, calibration is essential to verify that each sensor employed as
    a data retrieval module adheres to established measurement standards. Moreover,
    to provide the proposed method''s context and validate the findings, the preliminaries
    of this section consist of comparing the proposed mushroom cultivation model with
    baseline models as reported by Sun et al. [43] and Dela Cruz and De Leon [20].
    Table 2 presents a comparative analysis of baseline models commonly employed in
    mushroom cultivation, including Open Field Cultivation, Automated Watering Systems,
    Sensor Network-based Environment Control and IoT-based Environment Control. Each
    model is briefly characterized by its main features, outlining the strengths and
    limitations of these existing methodologies. The proposed new model, IoT and Fuzzy
    Logic-based Control is introduced as a comprehensive advancement. It integrates
    IoT for real-time data acquisition and fuzzy logic for adaptive and nuanced control.
    This integration aims to optimize environmental conditions for mushroom growth,
    addressing the shortcomings observed in the baseline models. Table 2. Comparison
    of the proposed model with benchmark algorithms. Model Main features Open field
    cultivation Traditional method with limited control over environmental parameters.
    Automated watering system Enhances water management but lacks adaptive control
    based on real-time conditions. Sensor network-based environment control Provides
    real-time data but may not adapt dynamically to varying cultivation needs. IoT-based
    environment control Offers remote monitoring and control but may require more
    sophisticated decision-making. Proposed IoT and fuzzy logic-based control Integrates
    IoT for real-time data and fuzzy logic for adaptive and nuanced control, optimizing
    environmental conditions for mushroom growth. The proposed IoT and Fuzzy Logic-based
    control model represents a significant advancement in mushroom cultivation methodologies,
    surpassing the capabilities of the baseline models in several key aspects. While
    traditional Open Field Cultivation and Automated Watering Systems offer basic
    approaches, they lack the adaptability and precision required for optimal growth.
    Sensor Network-based Environment Control and IoT-based Environment Control models
    provide real-time data. However, the former may not dynamically adapt, and the
    latter may face challenges in sophisticated decision-making. In contrast, our
    proposed model combines the strengths of IoT for continuous, real-time data acquisition
    and fuzzy logic for adaptive, nuanced control. This integration enables the system
    to make precise, context-aware adjustments based on the complex interplay of environmental
    variables, fostering an optimized and responsive cultivation environment. By leveraging
    these modern technologies, the comprehensive and advanced nature of our approach
    positions it as a valuable and innovative contribution to the field, poised to
    elevate the standards of mushroom cultivation practices. 4.1. Results based on
    sensor precision The soil moisture sensor undergoes calibration by obtaining analog
    values at two humidity levels: very wet (immersing the sensor in water) and dry
    (placing the sensor in a dry location). Subsequently, the map function is employed
    to convert the analog values into percentage values. Following this, calibration
    is executed using the Gouevn Soil Moisture Meter, comparing values acquired at
    four water depth points: 25 ml, 50 ml, 75 ml, and 100 ml. The outcomes of the
    soil moisture sensor calibration are detailed in Table 3. Post-calibration, the
    average error value is 4,79 %, indicating a high accuracy level of 95,21 %. Table

    error 4,79 Accuracy 95,21 In contrast to other sensors, the calibration procedure
    for this sensor involves comparing the reading from the reference sensor with
    the analog-to-analog-to-digital converter (ADC) value acquired. The Digital Lux
    Meter AS803 serves as the reference sensor in this process. The coefficient value
    is derived and then applied to the Arduino UNO R3 using the linear regression
    function. The x-value represents the ADC value from the sensor. At the same time,
    the y-value corresponds to the lux value determined through the comparative analysis.
    Like the previous step, the calibration is executed by re-evaluating and converting
    ADC values to lux values on the Light Dependent Resistor sensor against the digital
    readings on the reference measuring device. In this instance, the average error
    is 3,62 %, indicating a high accuracy level of 96,38 %. The outcomes of the light-dependent
    resistor sensor calibration are detailed in Table 4. The calibration of the DHT22
    involves comparing it with the Sanfix TH-308A. The data collection, performed
    nine times, includes air temperature measurements ranging from 16 to 40 degrees
    Celsius. Additionally, air humidity levels are measured using the Ultrasonic Humidifier
    Support Arduino module to manipulate humidity levels. Like the prior sensors,
    calibration is achieved by computing the average error value, resulting in a 97,33
    % accuracy for air temperature measurements and a 97,85 % accuracy for air humidity
    measurements, with an average error of 2,67 % for air temperature measurements
    and 2,15 % for air humidity measurements. The outcomes of the DHT22 sensor calibration

    overall system A crucial element in intelligent mushroom cultivation involves
    a real-time regulation of vital parameters in the farming space. This method benefits
    from the FL paradigm by optimizing the environmental parameters, ensuring favorable
    conditions for cultivation, and achieving high-quality productivity in mushroom
    farming. The FL program makes decisions to oversee multiple actuators, aiding
    in executing environmental control tasks for the mushroom farm. The evaluation
    process entails subjecting each measurement parameter to manipulated conditions
    and comparing it with sensor data. This work seeks to omit a timeframe for implementing
    FL to avoid excessive decision-making, significantly leading to potential overtreatment.
    The monitoring procedure is conducted using a web-based system with a sample interface
    illustrated in Fig. 5, which consists of a display accessible to farmers on a
    real-time basis. The interface gauge for soil moisture and air humidity depicts
    data in percentage units (%), ranging from a minimum value of 0 to a maximum value
    of 100. In contrast, the design of the interface gauge for light intensity differs.
    It presents data in lux units, with a minimum value of 58 lux (equivalent to a
    value of 1023 ADC on a Light Dependent Resistor) for dark conditions and a maximum
    value of 500 lux (equivalent to a value of 6 ADC on a Light Dependent Resistor)
    for bright conditions. The interface gauge for air temperature displays data in
    centigrade units, with a defined minimum value of 14 degrees Celsius and a maximum
    value of 40 degrees Celsius. Download : Download high-res image (483KB) Download

    information through an interface gauge, we have also incorporated information
    delivery to farmers through a graph, as depicted in Fig. 6. In this context, the
    graph serves as a data logger within a specified time frame. The x-axis of the
    graph represents time, while the y-axis displays data obtained from each sensor.
    We set one minute for soil moisture, air humidity, and light intensity graphs,
    with data appearing every five seconds. In the case of the air temperature graph,
    a period of three minutes is defined, with data appearing every thirty seconds.
    Graphs with one minute allow a precise observation of line level changes when
    the sensor registers data outside the reference range. In essence, FL can promptly
    provide information for decision-making on each actuator to execute environmental
    control in less than five seconds. Download : Download high-res image (664KB)

    techniques. Table 6 illustrates differences across various aspects of each study,
    including objectives and developed features. While all the studies in this section
    share the goal of enhancing environmental quality in mushroom crops, each focuses
    on distinct aspects. The detailed discussion on features is categorized into groups,
    such as the sensors used, the implemented technology communication model, and
    user-feedback applications on the job. Table 6. Features comparison between the

    wind and air. The diversity extends to the forms of technology communication and
    the availability of user-feedback applications. The proposed research employs
    various sensors for soil moisture, temperature, humidity, light intensity, and
    motion detection. To facilitate user feedback, we utilize two serially connected
    microcontrollers through a digital platform named ThingerIO. 4.3.2. Results comparison
    Besides the features comparison, it is worth noting that the number of monitored
    farm''s vital parameters consists of significant results to take care of to highlight
    the relevance and significance of the engineering findings, which emphasize the
    contribution of the proposed method in the current research landscape. Table 7
    offers a nuanced evaluation of the proposed method alongside existing state-of-the-art
    approaches. Beyond the conventional features comparison, the introduction underscores
    the significance of the number of monitored vital parameters as a pivotal metric
    for highlighting the engineering findings'' relevance and importance in the current
    research landscape. Based on the table data, it is evident that the proposed method
    stands out prominently. It excels in monitoring a comprehensive set of 5 vital
    parameters, surpassing the more limited scopes of the approaches outlined by Rahman
    et al. and Thong-un & Wongsaroj [45]. This expanded range implies a heightened
    capacity to capture diverse facets of the mushroom cultivation environment, enhancing
    the depth and richness of the data collected. Table 7. Comparison of the results.

    monitor in real-time basis [38] 2 3 Yes [12] 3 0 No [45] 2 3 Yes Proposed method
    5 6 Yes Furthermore, the proposed method distinguishes itself by employing a notable
    number of 6 actuating tools. This surpasses the comparatively lower tool count
    in the methods presented by Rahman et al. [38] and Thong-un and Wongsaroj [45].
    The greater number of actuating tools signifies a more sophisticated and versatile
    control mechanism, suggesting a higher degree of precision and adaptability in
    steering the farming of the mushroom environment. Crucially, the proposed method
    shares with Thong-un & Wongsaroj [45] the ability to monitor in real-time. This
    capability is recognized as essential for dynamic and responsive control, ensuring
    timely adjustments to changing conditions. In contrast, Rahman et al. [38] and
    Chandrappa et al. [12] lack this critical feature, potentially limiting their
    effectiveness in adapting to the rapidly evolving dynamics of the mushroom cultivation
    setting. The results prove that the proposed method emerges as a pioneering contribution
    to the current research landscape. Its prowess in monitoring an extensive array
    of vital parameters, utilizing a higher number of actuating tools, and facilitating
    real-time monitoring underscores its potential to revolutionize the field. 5.
    Conclusion Mushroom cultivation technology is a structured framework for overseeing
    and homogenizing the mushroom farm''s substrate environmental parameters. This
    study concentrates on the cultivation of mushrooms sharing a range of environmental
    parameters, where growth dynamics are contingent upon various physical factors,
    such as temperature, light, and humidity. Numerous research endeavors have explored
    intelligent systems in mushroom cultivation, particularly focusing on automating
    temperature and air humidity control through watering systems. Despite these efforts,
    there remains an oversight of other crucial factors in mushroom plant cultivation.
    For instance, managing light exposure, addressing insect disruptions, and utilizing
    natural or artificial lights are critical environmental considerations that significantly
    impact the quality of edible mushrooms before and after harvest. These factors
    are vital in influencing mycelium characteristics, such as growth rate, density,
    color, and the physical appearance of fruiting bodies, including stalk, cap, and
    color formation. It is crucial to emphasize light''s pivotal role in the cultivation
    of edible mushrooms. Additionally, research has identified the presence of insects,
    mites, crustaceans, and other arthropods feeding on mushrooms and decomposers
    on synthetic or wooden substrates as detrimental factors affecting the optimal
    growth of mushrooms. Consequently, there is a compelling need to advance agricultural
    technologies by considering all critical factors, enhancing both the quality and
    quantity of mushroom production. This study aims to address challenges in current
    mushroom production by developing an IoT-based system. The system integrates various
    modules to intelligently control crucial parameters, including temperature, humidity,
    substrate moisture, and light intensity. Moreover, the system incorporates a mechanism
    for pest control by automatically spraying pesticides when an external agent is
    detected in the mushroom farm. Fuzzy Logic (FL) is integrated into the IoT module,
    allowing the recorded sensor data to enable system functionality based on comparisons
    with pre-recorded standard data, defining optimal ranges for each vital parameter.
    The system activates actuators when sensor data falls outside the desired range,
    effectively maintaining the environmental parameters within optimal conditions
    for mushroom cultivation. Importantly, this method introduces self-decision-making
    through FL, a mathematical modeling technique emulating human decision-making.
    The contributions of this work include intelligent and adaptive monitoring of
    sensor data for creating an optimal environment for mushroom cultivation, as well
    as the optimization of agricultural resources, such as water and pesticides, through
    the introduction of previously unused sensors. Diversifying this method allows
    for a nuanced understanding of environmental factors applicable to various types
    of mushrooms within the field of mushroom cultivation. CRediT authorship contribution

    as a response to population growth and the demand for more food with quality,
    less waste, food security, and sustainable management of environmental resources.
    The challenges are to increase the productivity of cultivated areas, both for
    current and future areas, to manage the use of potable water, scarce in many regions,
    to keep the soil fertile, and to reduce waste through reuse, optimization, resource
    sharing, and operational and strategic management based on accurate information
    of planting, harvesting, and management of environmental conditions, which are
    also objectives of the Circular Economy. Therefore, using Industry 4.0 technologies
    in agriculture becomes fundamental to facing such challenges. This paper presents
    a systematic literature review on Industry 4.0 technologies adopted in agriculture
    for sustainable development, considering environmental, economic, and social benefits.
    The research pointed to the use of IoT in irrigation control systems by sending
    automatic commands, monitoring soil and weather conditions, in the use of machinery
    with some automation features and in cloud data storage systems, and with the
    use of Big Data analytical tools, with access by mobile devices, these uses contribute
    to operational and strategic decision making in the management of planting and
    harvesting. However, the literature review did not find a technological architecture
    for Integrated Services in Agriculture 4.0. Thus, this paper proposes a Service
    Architecture that enables the promotion of a Circular Economy in Agriculture 4.0.
    The contribution of this article to the theory is in the expansion of knowledge
    of the use of technologies in Agriculture 4.0. In terms of practice, this article
    provides an Integrated Service Architecture so that new products can be developed
    for Agriculture 4.0 and thus contribute to society in reducing food insecurity,
    generating environmental, economic, and social benefits, and promoting the Circular

    The increase in the world’s population in recent years and the forecast to reach
    9 billion by 2050 impact the need to increase food productivity [1] using the
    same agricultural areas, with reduced costs and less environmental impact. Factors
    such as extreme weather events, more demanding consumers, population concentrated
    in urban centers, and scarce natural resources are the major challenges to be
    faced [2]. In this context, some technologies of Industry 4.0 implemented in agriculture
    in recent years have generated impacts in several regions with climate change,
    scarcity of drinking water, and soil degradation, and in this context, some Industry
    4.0 technologies [3] can contribute to the management of inputs for planting and
    harvesting, the optimization of soil [4], water, and fertilizer use [5], an increase
    in productivity and food quality, and a decrease in environmental impacts [6]
    with the replacement of fossil energy sources by bio-renewable ones [7]. The digital
    revolution has had a great impact on development in several areas [8,9,10,11],
    and in agriculture [12], water use management projects [5] with controlled irrigation
    [6], use of soil parameter sensors [13] with nutrient application [14], and real-time
    monitoring [15] of increasingly unfavorable weather conditions in many regions
    [16] are options for smart agriculture [17]. The digitalization of agriculture
    [18] with the adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies [19] has the potential to
    expand productivity, better control the product life cycle, aid cooperation in
    the production chain [20], reduce environmental impacts, improve food safety with
    reduced food waste [21], and increase the sustainable use of natural resources
    [22,23], and resilience to supply in times of scarcity [24]. The collection of
    large volumes of on-farm data [17,25], indicating weather and planting conditions
    [26], more detailed knowledge about planting and harvesting [27], and decreased
    waste [28], makes processes more controlled [17,25] and serves to support farmers
    in data-driven decision-making processes [21,29,30]. Integrating smallholder farmers
    into innovative trends [31] contributes to keeping young people in the countryside
    with rural tourism and social entrepreneurship activities, diversifying household
    income [32]. Additionally, various technological solutions are still restricted
    to large agricultural conglomerates and are more focused on profit than on food
    security and social context [33]. The Agriculture 4.0 revolution is an opportunity
    for farmers to meet the challenges in food production and enable the creation
    of added value by combining innovative technologies: precision agriculture, information
    and communication technology, robotics, and Big Data [34]. The increase in food
    production and, consequently, the consumption of natural resources, combined with
    other industrial activities, have increasingly affected environmental, social,
    and economic conditions [35]. Thus, the concept of the Circular Economy, with
    examples in China in the 1990s, in the use of natural resources [36], presents
    a change in the form of business and can contribute to the sustainable development
    of society [37]. The objectives of the Circular Economy are to reuse materials
    through recycling processes [38] and with the principles of conservation of natural
    resources, balancing consumption between renewable and non-renewable resources,
    with a longer lifetime of resource use and a reduction in the negative effects
    of productive systems [39]. These are important factors that can be applied with
    the new technologies of Industry 4.0 in precision agriculture to generate environmental,
    economic, and social balance. A few studies have explored various technologies
    in agriculture, but none have addressed an Integrated Service Architecture or
    its role in promoting the Circular Economy by illustrating how these technologies
    interact and collaborate. Moreover, the implementation of technologies was limited
    to an automation process such as irrigation control, fertilizer control, or even
    the storage of harvest variables and provision of some computerized support for
    farmers. Considering the great demand for food production, food safety, innovations,
    and new technologies to evaluate and minimize environmental and social impacts,
    no studies were found that can provide information to farmers about farm management,
    natural resource use needs, plantation and harvest data, and support for strategic
    or operational decision making. Based on the findings, this research aims to propose
    a Service Architecture that integrates Industry 4.0 technologies with the Circular
    Economy principles to promote sustainable development in agriculture. The paper
    provides a structured examination beginning with an introduction, followed by
    a detailed methodology in Section 2, an exploration of the Service Architecture
    for smart agriculture in Section 3, and ending with comprehensive conclusions
    in Section 4. 2. Methodology The study employed a systematic literature review
    to select and analyze scientific research on Industry 4.0 technologies applied
    in agriculture and their associated environmental, economic, and social gains.
    Bibliometrics enabled the identification of diverse publications, along with the
    use of quantitative and graphical data [40] and a systematic literature review
    to develop content analysis, coding, and categorization of data [41]. The systematic
    review applied in this research is characterized as a scientific, replicable,
    and transparent method [42]. Data verification was performed by two researchers
    to reduce researcher error and bias [43], by filtering the selected research [44]
    through systematic reviews and analyses with the adoption of inclusion and exclusion
    criteria [45]. The initial stage of planning the systematic literature review
    involved the definition of the research protocol, which included the search strategies,
    selection criteria, and analysis of the selected articles. For this study, the
    research objective was to propose a Service Architecture that enables the promotion
    of a Circular Economy in Agriculture 4.0. The next step was the definition of
    the search terms and a consistent scientific procedure, including the definition
    of a set of keywords referring to Industry 4.0-enabling technologies. They were
    created as shown in Table A1, and with the use of logical operators OR and AND,
    the search strings were built in the Scopus digital library, as presented in Table
    A2. For the information collection step, the authors utilized the Scopus database
    chosen for its technical and scientific content, as well as content from areas
    related to the objectives of this article. A total of 1425 articles were identified,
    and these will be comprehensively detailed in the Bibliometrics section (Section
    3.1). In Table A3, the inclusion and exclusion criteria utilized in the systematic
    literature review are presented. A systematic literature review was undertaken,
    revealing a total of 755 articles. From this pool, 271 articles underwent thorough
    content analysis, leading to the identification of 114 articles specifically addressing
    the application of Industry 4.0 technologies in agriculture, as illustrated in
    Table 1. Table 1. Industry 4.0 technologies used in farms, production, and supply
    chain in the food agriculture sector. 1 = Farm; 2 = Factory; 3 = Supply Chain;
    4 = Big Data. 3. Service Architecture for Smart Agriculture In this section, the
    bibliometric review and the proposed Service Architecture for smart agriculture
    will be presented. 3.1. Bibliometrics The initial search using the specified strings
    (refer to Table A1) resulted in a total of 1425 articles, categorized into various
    types, as outlined in Table A4. Figure 1 shows the number of studies classified
    by year. It is notable that there is a growing interest in the adoption of Industry
    4.0 technologies in agriculture. This interest is influenced by factors such as
    the increase in the world population and the necessity to produce higher-quality
    food, enhance productivity per hectare, and ensure sustainability throughout the
    agricultural chain. Figure 1. Distribution of selected articles published by year.
    The utilization of IoT on farms, as the most widely adopted technology, involves
    the incorporation of sensors and devices for measuring soil and environmental
    characteristics. Subsequently, the adoption of IoT technologies, the cloud, Big
    Data, and AI (artificial intelligence) [78] signifies that farms not only monitor
    soil and environmental data but also store them in cloud services. With the utilization
    of tools such as artificial intelligence within the Big Data ecosystem, they can
    already add value in business management and decision-making processes. Another
    crucial aspect is the integration of IoT and AI within a context where computing
    is transitioning to the edge, involving microcontrolled systems and artificial
    intelligence algorithms. This transition contributes to reducing latency in communication
    networks [86]. 3.2. Proposed Architecture Following the findings of the systematic
    literature review (Section 2), the articles were analyzed and evaluated based
    on their contribution to constructing a layered structure. This structure facilitates
    the organized placement and integration of technologies. Figure 2 illustrates
    the proposed architecture developed to promote a Circular Economy in Agriculture
    4.0. Figure 2. Proposed architecture. The architecture depicted in Figure 2 consists
    of sensors, connections between farm machinery, local and remote networks (via
    the Internet), cloud platforms, storage utilizing Big Data technologies, and computer
    systems operating both in the cloud and in computer centers. The information generated
    by expert systems, data analysis, and the utilization of artificial intelligence
    provides outputs in the form of dashboards, directs actions on connected equipment,
    and facilitates decision making, both at the strategic and operational levels.
    This architecture comprises three layers: the “Farm Scenery” data collection layer,
    the ”Cloud Storage” data collection layer, and the “Information Processing, Analysis,
    and Output” central processing layer responsible for processing and outputting
    information for decision making: “Farm Scenery” layer: Precision agriculture is
    conducted here through the application of Industry 4.0 technologies. This involves
    sensors for the automated real-time collection of agricultural data, including
    water consumption, land use, and other input variables. The sensors and machines
    are interconnected through wireless networks in an IoT system. “Cloud Storage”
    layer: Data collected via wireless sensor networks, positioned at various points
    in the plantation, are transmitted to the cloud. This process is facilitated by
    a gateway, which serves to convert communication technologies from the sensor
    network into Internet access technologies. “Information Processing, Analysis,
    and Output” layer: The received data undergo analysis using computational tools,
    and the resulting information is utilized for decision making, both at the control
    center level and within the farm itself. Information visualization is made accessible
    through graphic panels on local computers or mobile devices, printed reports,
    and commands for direct action on devices installed on the farm, thereby enabling
    some processes to be fully automated. The architecture will be elaborated by organizing
    the findings of the systematic literature review obtained from digital databases
    into the three layers of the proposed structure. 3.2.1. Farm Scenery Layer Data
    digitization in agriculture begins with identifying the variables to be controlled
    when planting on farms [84], such as temperature, moisture, and soil nutrients,
    as well as weather conditions such as humidity, air temperature, light, crop nutrients
    [76], and pest control [121]. IoT enables this through sensors installed at various
    points on the farm, exchanging information between electronic devices [113] and
    applied in agriculture to provide monitoring of weather, soil thermal conditions
    [81], and water [29,30], pest and disease detection [103], and product traceability
    [101]. Industry 4.0 technologies applied to agriculture enable real-time data
    collection, input management, soil control, disease prevention, increased production,
    optimizing resources, and generating income [114]. The use of drones with IoT
    sensors is already a possibility for data collection in scenarios where the installation
    of sensor networks is not possible [91]. Temperature affects crop growth and the
    breeding of bacteria, and through a system of collecting air and soil temperature
    and humidity, a mathematical model was developed that evaluates environmental
    conditions and compares them with established standards, generating alerts for
    decision making by farmers [126]. The need to reduce the use of natural resources
    such as water and fertilizers in agriculture, the treatment of waste generated
    in planting, harvesting, and food industry processing activities, and the increase
    in production [14] have been the driver for the deployment of Industry 4.0 technologies
    in agriculture [117]. The analysis of climate conditions for agriculture is based
    on three factors: resource management, ecosystem conservation [114], and adequate
    services to farmers using information technology, thus generating profitability,
    product quality, and reducing the environmental footprint, with less use of pesticides
    [90]. Crop irrigation uses a source of water that is transported through pipelines
    and with on-and-off actuating devices and valves that then control the flow of
    water. The amount of water depends on each crop, and several forms of irrigation
    can be used, such as drip, sprinkler, furrow, and manual [127]. A simulation of
    irrigation control applied on farms in Brazil, with the use of IoT technologies,
    is a model considering the parameters of water requirements and irrigation time,
    which directly affect water use efficiency and evapotranspiration [30]. On the
    other hand, a low-cost system with environmental data acquisition can provide
    measurements of air temperature and velocity, soil temperature, pH, and dissolved
    oxygen, and thus control plant growth and environmental impacts [26]. A potato
    production system in Cyprus [114] was developed by using a sensor network to collect
    air and soil characteristics, and the data were sent to the cloud, where they
    were stored and analyzed, thus providing services to farmers for pest control
    and commands for automatic irrigation and fertilization [95]. Climate change has
    a strong impact on agriculture, and parameters such as water scarcity, soil degradation,
    increased energy needs, population growth, and increased demand for food impact
    the search for solutions [114]. For instance, the construction of smart greenhouses
    makes it possible to manage environmental variables [113] with control of humidity,
    air quantity, temperature, and favorable characteristics for plants [28,111] using
    models to manage heating, ventilation, CO2 control, and artificial lighting in
    an infrastructure that contributes to precision, sustainable, and manageable agriculture
    [113]. The data collected by the various sensors dispersed throughout the crops
    need to be sent for storage and analysis to extract information that can assist
    in decision making and return automated commands for control, since the Internet
    is not yet fully available in agricultural areas. It becomes necessary to use
    wireless network technologies in agriculture digitization projects, collecting
    data from distributed sensors in the field [4,84]. Applications with wireless
    sensor networks in smart agriculture include covering large areas with interconnecting
    sensors [6] and gathering large amounts of data. Activities in agriculture have
    integrated IoT technologies in robotic systems and been applied in planting, harvesting,
    and food production to enable cooperation between workers and smart systems and
    information sharing in the food production chain [107]. A proposed innovative
    smart IoT-based system based on microprocessors and a Single-Board Computer (BSC)
    for data logging using various sensors [50] can monitor soil moisture, air humidity,
    air temperature, and UV light, supporting precision irrigation of crops and enabling
    real-time exploitation of data for minimization of errors, as well as forecasting.
    In Colombia, on a coffee farm, wireless sensor networks are used to collect leaf
    condition data remotely through image analysis processing, detect diseases on
    the plantation [94], and generate information for pesticide application. This
    strategy decreases the risks of crop loss and improves the productive performance
    of the farm [112]. Automated fertigation [109] is applied in precision agriculture
    by collecting data on moisture and soil characteristics, and through an IoT system
    and sensor networks with ZigBee technology, the system was developed to control
    fertilizer use and reduce water consumption [14], thus providing reduced environmental
    impacts [95]. The growth of the number of sensors scattered in agriculture can
    generate a large amount of data, and latency problems may occur in sending data
    through technologies such as Bluetooth in relevant virtual network scenarios [75].
    Applications using machine learning [93] with a prototype for acquiring data from
    multiple sensors, machine learning algorithms, Geo statistics, and localization
    of IoT devices [115] are examples. The case study using computer vision [94] and
    machine learning [27] for inspecting coffee leaves on a farm in Colombia is an
    important practical example. The use of tractors in agriculture [3] plays an important
    role in farms and [98] modern combustion systems with electronic systems, including
    the use of algorithms and artificial intelligence [78], managing fuel injection,
    reducing pollutant emissions, lowering fuel costs [5], and improving environmental
    and economic gains. Tractors equipped with GPS (Global Positioning System), through
    the CAN-BUS (Controller Area Network) protocol, transmit the data of tasks performed
    and, after analysis, evaluate the most appropriate use of the tractor, extending
    the useful life and reducing maintenance costs [87]. In research conducted in
    Brazil, agricultural machines equipped with automation technologies have proven
    very productive in sowing, spraying, fertilizing, and harvesting activities, doing
    so autonomously, with relevant economic gains and lower cost per hectare [3].
    An automatic irrigation control system using IoT, with data input from weather
    stations and soil moisture sensors interconnected by gateway LoRa (Long Range)
    networks and command messages sent by the MQTT protocol (Message Queuing Telemetry
    Transport) [6], adapts the efficient use of water on a plantation, generating
    savings and better product quality [8]. It is important to note that using advanced
    technologies such as IoT and AI to manage irrigation is a way to maximize crop
    yield while minimizing water consumption, in line with Agriculture 4.0 principles
    [51]. Nonetheless, intelligent sensing systems based on the edge-computing paradigm
    are essential for the implementation of Internet of Things (IoT) and Agriculture
    4.0 applications, and the development of edge-computing wireless sensing systems
    is required to improve sensor accuracy in soil and data interpretation [47]. The
    Farm Scenery layer is presented in Figure 3, and the environmental variables to
    be collected are environmental humidity, temperature, luminosity, temperature,
    pH, water flow, and soil parameters, as shown in Table 2. Figure 3. Farm Scenery
    layer of Integrated Service Architecture to promote Circular Economy in Agriculture
    4.0. Green Circle = Start Process, Red Circle = End Process, Dotted Line = Comments,
    Flat Line = Information Flow. Table 2. Input variables used for soil monitoring
    and irrigation. 3.2.2. Cloud Storage Layer The data collected through wireless
    sensor networks, installed at various points of the plantation, are sent to the
    cloud with the use of a gateway, which is equipment that converts communication
    technologies of the sensor network to Internet access technologies, such as networks
    with LoRa technology [79]. Smart horticulture incorporates a variety of technologies,
    devices, protocols, and computational models to enhance farming processes. Blockchain,
    Big Data, artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and edge processing provide
    capabilities and solutions for storing, analyzing, and managing the vast data
    generated by components [74]. The data collected from sensors on the farm and
    sent for storage in a cloud environment (Figure 4) are transformed into information
    that will be used for decision making in agricultural management actions. Thus,
    autonomous systems of irrigation control and fertilizer application can be built,
    contributing to the economy of financial resources for the purchase of these inputs;
    environmental gains, with a reduction in the use of scarce resources in nature
    and in workers’ exposure to some of these products, are obtained, along with social
    gains, such as a reduction in diseases, accidents, and sick leave [102]. Figure
    4. Cloud Storage layer of the Integrated Service Architecture to promote Circular
    Economy in Agriculture 4.0. Dotted Line = Comments, Flat Line = Information Flow.
    With an architecture for monitoring variables of the air, soil, planting, and
    harvesting in a corn plantation and using sensors interconnected in wireless networks
    and communication gateways, the data are sent for cloud storage to allow its analysis
    [16]. 3.2.3. Information Processing, Analysis, and Output Layer After the stage
    of data analysis using computational tools and the extraction of information,
    the next stage is the output, with the visualization of information through graphical
    panels available on web pages or mobile devices such as smartphones, printed reports,
    and commands of action in devices installed on the farm, making some processes
    automated. The use of software for agricultural planning provides management of
    farms, the production chain, and the distribution of the food produced [121].
    The monitoring of environmental variables is context-sensitive and provides information
    to end-users such as farmers, agronomists, and traders for decision making and
    supporting agricultural production [16]. Machine learning plays an important role
    in data processing, collection, extraction, and mining activities using algorithms,
    neural networks, and artificial intelligence, which are applied in a variety of
    areas, such as energy, transportation, mining, shipping, healthcare, banking,
    security, and agriculture. Security requirements using machine learning in industrial
    systems [97], which analyze Blockchain-based strategies to preserve privacy in
    industrial systems with data security in sensors [19], can lead to product traceability
    and automated logistics management, saving time and financial resources [108]
    and decreasing food waste [88]. The application of machine learning and analysis
    techniques in agriculture and livestock provides productivity gains with the management
    of animal health and flock management, thereby improving land use, controlling
    animal nutrition, and reducing the environmental impacts generated [96]. The use
    of technologies in data processing in agriculture offers opportunities for the
    integration of diverse systems. A review of the technology standards used in cyber-physical
    systems (CPSs) [125] applied in advanced manufacturing builds the ontology of
    the 5C architecture layers (connection, conversion, computation, cognition, and
    configuration), thus enabling the integration of sensors, actuators, and protocols
    and their application in various areas. In agriculture, CPSs are used in planting
    and harvesting equipment, collecting information on soil conditions and water
    resources, and storage in cloud systems for further processing [107]. The use
    of IoT platforms with microservices involves independent processes acting on specific
    activities, such as, for example, data collection of soil, climate, and parameters
    of irrigated rice and cotton crops [110]. The platform involves hardware and software
    in the cloud, and focuses on irrigation management, presented scalability, flexibility,
    robustness, security, and performance, with possibilities of commercial applications
    in other agricultural crops. An infrastructure using low-cost IoT and free software
    code to monitor weather conditions in organic crops, in a greenhouse, automatically
    controls and generates information made available through graphs on web pages
    with HTML protocol (HyperText Markup Language) [28]. The organization of farms
    by management zones [109] reduces costs for fertilization, pesticides [82,83],
    and water, and with the agricultural records of each one, one can have a decision
    more suitable to the needs of the crop. This strategy applied in a vineyard in
    Spain allows the crops to be classified into three levels of interest: soil, plant,
    or product, thus creating a map with overlapping layers to determine wine quality
    [25]. Sugarcane is planted in several fields on a farm, and as the plantation
    matures, fields are selected for harvesting, which is called harvest windows.
    A model to guide planting and harvesting on farms in South Africa [122] caused
    increased productivity and optimization based on historical data collected when
    adjusted in real-time. A machine routing system is possible in sugar production
    using sensors and IoT techniques, replacing labor and providig more suitable routing,
    higher repeatability, decreased fuel consumption, and better process control,
    with economic and environmental gains [116]. The management of agricultural supply
    chain activities, with the adoption of ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) systems
    and BI (Business Intelligence) techniques, enables communication between those
    involved in the agricultural chain [105], more adequate control, faster solutions
    [7,104] to respond to climate variations, pest control, crop harvesting and management,
    and market trends [118]. Ref. [121] presents studies among farmers in Maranhão,
    Piauí, Tocantins, and western Bahia, in soybean, corn, cotton, coffee, sugarcane,
    beans, and fruit crops where production and marketing integration, material flow
    automation, data management, and more accurate diagnostics to support strategic
    decisions have been adopted as tools of smart farm managers. The presentation
    of information in graphical dashboards becomes a decision support tool for farmers,
    with the use of Internet environments and mobile devices making access much easier
    and more intuitive [7,28]. The Information Processing, Analysis, and Output layer
    is shown in the Figure 5. Figure 5. Information Processing, Analysis, and Output
    layer of the Integrated Service Architecture to promote Circular Economy in Agriculture
    4.0. Red Circle = End Process, Dotted Line = Comments, Flat Line = Information
    Flow. 3.2.4. Service Architecture for Smart Agriculture The substantial volume
    of data generated through the utilization of IoT in agriculture is stored via
    networks and cloud computing. Leveraging Big Data and analytics strategies, it
    facilitates enhanced production by aiding decisions concerning planting, harvesting,
    and production, and automatically issuing commands for irrigation, thereby saving
    the scarce resource of water [5]. A system facilitating the collection of crop
    data, including air temperature, humidity, and soil temperature, stored as input
    variables in the cloud, has undergone analysis to derive actionable insights for
    controlling corn crop cultivation [16]. Utilizing a wireless network architecture
    to connect sensors and a LoRa communication gateway for data transmission to the
    cloud, the subsequent step involves data analysis and extraction of information
    for decision making. This process also includes sending commands to regulate irrigation
    valves, fertilizing devices, lighting control, and heating/cooling systems, embodying
    an autonomous application [16]. A prototype for autonomous irrigation, developed
    and deployed in a farmer cooperative in Spain, gathers data on air temperature,
    humidity, and soil characteristics. These data are transmitted via a LoRa network
    with a coverage range of 5 km to a cloud server. Subsequent analysis returns commands
    for irrigation control, while mobile applications provide information to farmers
    [100]. In Indonesia, image processing using machine learning algorithms was applied
    on a cocoa farm. Texture data of the beans, collected remotely and transmitted
    to the cloud, underwent classification using artificial intelligence techniques,
    demonstrating superior performance compared to traditional visualization methods
    [106]. The processing of vast sensor-generated data on farms is routed to the
    cloud [114,119]. Leveraging Big Data tools [85,117], these data are analyzed and
    converted into actionable information for managerial decision making and issuing
    automation commands for field equipment. A decision support system incorporating
    AI and a suite of machine learning algorithms aids in enhancing overall crop harvest
    quality and accuracy in precision agriculture [52]. This research utilized a dataset
    downloaded from Kaggle, containing eight features with seven independent variables,
    including N, P, K, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall. Furthermore, optimization
    techniques were employed to further enhance performance in smart factories. Figure
    6 illustrates the complete design of the Integrated Service Architecture derived
    from the results of the systematic literature review of selected articles, aimed
    at promoting the Circular Economy in Agriculture 4.0. Figure 6. Operational vision
    of the Integrated Service Architecture to promote Circular Economy in Agriculture
    4.0. Green Circle = Start Process, Red Circle = End Process, Dotted Line = Comments,
    Flat Line = Information Flow. In the layer designated as “Information Processing,
    Analysis, and Output” within the Integrated Service Architecture aimed at advancing
    the Circular Economy in Agriculture 4.0, the references are categorized according
    to their respective applications, including irrigation control systems, fertilizer
    and pesticide application, crop management, greenhouses, and organization and
    management. These classifications are presented in Table 3 for clarity and ease
    of reference. Table 3. Management systems and outputs used in Intelligent Agriculture.
    3.2.5. Economic, Environmental, and Social Gains The integration of Industry 4.0
    technologies in agriculture empowers farmers with control over crucial resources
    such as water, nutrients [109], pesticides, energy, machinery, robotic devices
    [77], and human resources [32]. Data-driven decision making and innovative business
    models [119] are instrumental in enhancing production strategies [13], reutilizing
    process waste [114], and minimizing losses across the agribusiness chain. Consequently,
    economic benefits can be assessed by analyzing the efficient management of input
    resources utilized in production, alongside the increased availability of high-quality
    products offering added value to consumers. This added value encompasses aspects
    such as product differentiation, enriched nutritional content, and innovative
    packaging strategies, contributing to market competitiveness and profitability
    in agriculture. Environmental benefits are quantifiable through monitoring resource
    consumption indicators such as water usage, nutrient management, and greenhouse
    gas emissions. Furthermore, sustainable agricultural practices may lead to ecosystem
    restoration, biodiversity conservation, and soil health improvement, thereby enhancing
    environmental value and resilience. Social benefits encompass improvements in
    food security [1], reduced dependency on hazardous inputs, and the creation of
    employment opportunities in rural areas [32]. Initiatives fostering inclusivity
    and community engagement contribute to the formation of social capital and overall
    societal well-being. 3.2.6. Circular Economy Important resources for food production
    are wasted, with only 40% of irrigation water reaching the plants, and merely
    5% of the applied fertilizer being transformed into nutrients absorbed by humans.
    Soil degradation affects between 30 and 85% of agricultural land, exacerbating
    food insecurity issues [39]. Following the linear production model for food production
    is no longer sustainable, especially in a scenario where necessary resources are
    increasingly scarce [128]. Therefore, to minimize the utilization of finite natural
    resources, it is imperative to adopt the principles of Circular Economy, which
    include preserving and enhancing natural capital by managing finite stocks and
    balancing renewable resource flows, optimizing resource yields through the circulation
    of products, components, and materials in technical and biological cycles, and
    fostering system effectiveness by addressing and mitigating negative externalities
    [39]. Figure 7 illustrates systems of the Circular Economy in a diagram, showcasing
    the management flow of renewable energy and finite materials, while highlighting
    the fundamental principles of circularity. Figure 7. Diagram of Circular Economy
    systems [129]. In the systematic literature review on Agriculture 4.0 and the
    associated technologies, only two articles were identified that mentioned the
    Circular Economy, along with a study outlining the barriers to its adoption [84],
    highlighting the lack of incentive and governmental support. Main challenges identified
    include pesticide usage and unproductive laborers [83]. Although the Circular
    Economy was not explicitly referenced, several articles demonstrated evidence
    of its application. Therefore, based on the ReSOLVE framework, evidence of Circular
    Economy implementation in Agriculture 4.0 was identified. This includes models
    for Regenerate (soil regeneration, nutrient recovery, utilization of renewable
    energy, and finite resource reuse), Share (equipment and technology sharing, as
    well as waste sharing), Optimize (automation, pesticide and water usage optimization,
    and energy consumption optimization), Loop (remanufacturing, reverse logistics,
    and recycling), Virtualize (information virtualization and remote service utilization),
    and Exchange (integration of new technologies such as IoT, cloud, Big Data, and
    robotics). The ReSOLVE framework operationalizes these principles through six
    key actions: Regenerate, Share, Optimize, Loop, Virtualize, and Exchange, as shown
    in Figure 8. Figure 8. Framework ReSOLVE—adapted from [130]. These actions involved
    analyzing the articles to ascertain the evidence of Circular Economy usage, which
    was then compiled and is presented in Table 4. Table 4. Variables to evaluate
    evidence of practices of use of Circular Economy in Agriculture 4.0. 4. Conclusions
    This paper presents a systematic literature review on Industry 4.0 technologies
    applied in agriculture, analyzing 114 selected articles to fulfill the research
    objective of proposing an integrated Service Architecture to promote the Circular
    Economy in Agriculture 4.0. A systematic literature review is chosen over traditional
    analysis due to its comprehensive and rigorous synthesis of existing research,
    which provides a nuanced understanding of the topic and helps identify gaps in
    the literature. This approach ensures that the work is grounded in thorough knowledge
    of existing research, enhancing the credibility and validity of the findings and
    advancing knowledge in the field. Research indicates that farms are increasingly
    leveraging IoT for sensor connectivity as a foundational step towards embracing
    a data-centric approach. This transition is underscored by a shift towards a culture
    of data-driven decision making, facilitated by the integration of advanced analytics
    and AI within cloud-based Big Data ecosystems. This research adds to our understanding
    of how Industry 4.0 technologies are currently applied in agriculture, identifying
    both the technologies used and their application areas. Studies have shown that
    farms are utilizing Industry 4.0 technologies for irrigation control [6,30,109,110,114,120];
    fertilizer and inputs [95,110,114]; planting and harvest management [26,28,111,116];
    agricultural greenhouse systems [113]; and area-based planting organization [7,25,109,121,122].
    A few studies were found on evaluating economic, environmental, and social gains
    generated by adopting Industry 4.0 technologies on farms and the connection between
    Industry 4.0 technologies adopted on farms and the Circular Economy. Therefore,
    the authors proposed an Integrated Service Architecture to promote the Circular
    Economy in Agriculture 4.0, composed of three layers: Farm Scenery, Cloud Storage,
    and the Information Processing, Analysis, and Output layer. The Farm Scenery layer
    is responsible for executing precision agriculture, utilizing sensors to automatically
    collect data and interconnecting them through wireless networks in a system known
    as the Internet of Things. The Cloud Storage layer is responsible for gathering
    data from various points on the plantation and transmitting them to cloud servers,
    facilitated by gateways. The Information Processing, Analysis, and Output layer
    is tasked with analyzing the received data. It utilizes tools from the Big Data
    ecosystem to generate information, aiding in decision making, issuing automatic
    commands to activate irrigation control equipment and inputs, and presenting management
    reports on graphical screens accessible via computers or mobile devices. These
    reports encompass economic, environmental, and social gains. This paper enriches
    existing theory by introducing a novel Service Architecture designed to advance
    Circular Economy principles within Agriculture 4.0. The proposed framework aims
    to foster economic, environmental, and social benefits, thereby enhancing sustainability
    in agricultural practices. The practical contribution centers on developers’ ability
    to utilize the proposed architecture to construct monitoring systems with IoT,
    applications for decision-making analysis, and management tools, fostering a data-driven
    decision culture on farms. The societal contribution lies in the potential to
    alleviate food insecurity and reduce waste. As a limitation of this research,
    its initial application is solely on farms. However, there is potential for expansion
    into the broader agribusiness supply chain as future prospects emerge. Future
    research includes adapting this Integrated Service Architecture for use in other
    activities within the agricultural chain, incorporating specific input variables
    and output indicators on screens and autonomous systems as needed. Another possibility
    is integrating other actors in the agribusiness chain into the Integrated Service
    Architecture, thereby enhancing the management of the agricultural ecosystem.
    Additionally, it can broaden the practical applications or policies that stem
    from this study. Author Contributions Conceptualization, W.A.V., G.C.d.O.N. and

  description: Internet of Things (IoT) as refers to a network of devices that have
    the ability to connect, collect and exchange data with other devices over the
    Internet. IoT is a revolutionary technology that have tremendous applications
    in numerous fields of engineering and sciences such as logistics, healthcare,
    traffic, oil and gas industries and agriculture. In agriculture field, the farmer
    still used conventional agriculture methods resulting in low crop and fruit yields.
    The integration of IoT in conventional agriculture methods has led to significant
    developments in agriculture field. Different sensors and IoT devices are providing
    services to automate agriculture precision and to monitor crop conditions. These
    IoT devices are deployed in agriculture environment to increase yields production
    by making smart farming decisions and to collect data regarding crops temperature,
    humidity and irrigation systems. However, the integration of IoT and smart communication
    technologies in agriculture environment introduces cyber security attacks and
    vulnerabilities. Such cyber attacks have the capability to adversely affect the
    countries’ economies that are heavily reliant on agriculture. On the other hand,
    these IoT devices are resource constrained having limited memory and power capabilities
    and cannot be secured using conventional cyber security protocols. Therefore,
    designing robust and efficient secure framework for smart agriculture are required.
    In this paper, a Cyber Secured Framework for Smart Agriculture (CSFSA) is proposed.
    The proposed CSFSA presents a robust and tamper resistant authentication scheme
    for IoT devices using Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) to ensure the data
    integrity and authenticity. The proposed CSFSA is demonstrated in Contiki NG simulation
    tool and greatly reduces packet size, communication overhead and power consumption.
    The performance of proposed CSFSA is computationally efficient and is resilient
    against various cyber security attacks i.e., replay attacks, Denial of Service
    (DoS) attacks, resource exhaustion.

    to connect physical objects to the Internet from any place any time for anything
    without human intervention by making everything smart. This advancement is referred
    to as the Internet of Things (IoT) [1]. One of this century’s key technological
    development has been the IoT, which is still in its fancy stages. In the coming
    years, this development is expected to hit a big figure. By the end of 2024, 62
    billion IoT devices are expected to exist [2]. According to Statista report, it
    is predicted that this number will rise to 75.4 billion by 2025. The significance
    of the IoT system has been acknowledged by major international standards bodies,
    thereby ensuring development towards the proper functionality, flexibility and
    compatibility of this system. Due to which IoT is making an impact in the majority
    of the fields i.e., healthcare, traffic, logistics, oil and gas industries and
    agriculture [3]. The IoT enables devices with a variety of features and capabilities
    to connect to the Internet. The rapid rise of IoT applications results to a tremendous
    increase in the number of IoT devices connected to the worldwide network as well
    as network traffic over conventional network. Due to its constrained nature, the
    IoT growth adds more security challenges to the conventional network, as the conventional
    communication network already faces various security challenges. Different IoT
    devices are not constructed to the necessary security requirements, resulting
    in huge security breaches [4]. Food consciousness has grown amongst the people
    lately with the exponential increase of the food industries and radical improvements
    in individuals’ dietary behaviors and ways of life [5]. People nowadays are more
    worried about the quality and safety of the food they consume. Food safety is
    perceived to include food that is liberated from contaminants and chemicals that
    may cause the development of microscopic organisms destructive to individuals’
    safety and lives [6]. Agriculture systems has a significant impact on a country’s
    economic growth as it is the main source of food. According to report published
    by the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization [7], a significant portion
    of food waste happens due to various variables during the pre-harvesting, harvest
    and even post-harvest stages and as well the extent of its influence on the economy,
    environment, health and survival of human race. According to a UN report, the
    world population is estimated to surpass 9 billion humans being by the end of
    2050, an increase of about a third over the current population [8]. More than
    half of this increase will occur in Pakistan, Nigeria, India, Indonesia, Ethiopia,
    the United Republic of Tanzania, Egypt, and the United States. Such rise in population
    necessitates a nearly 70 percent increase in food production rate. This fast growing
    population brings with it a slew of additional challenges, including increased
    competition and overuse of land, water and also other natural resources. These
    challenges highlight critical need to minimize food system’s reliance on our environment.
    As a result, in order to meet the expanding need for food and crop production,
    an evolutionary agricultural paradigm is required to ensure long-term development.
    In an agricultural field, a smart sensing system is necessary to integrate the
    status of the field, its influence on field productivity, and to determine the
    actions that must be taken on the field for a good outcome of a good produce.
    A smart sensing environment is made up of a system of connected devices that can
    constantly send and receive data from one another. It can also make decisions
    on behalf of a user and take action to enhance the environment [9]. This shift
    in the environment necessitates more constant monitoring of the surroundings,
    resulting in an ever-changing environment. Agriculture plays an important role
    in country’s economic growth and it is the basis for human species. Conventional
    agricultural methods are still being used by farmers, resulting in low crop and
    fruit yields. As a result, integrating IoT technologies can boost crop productivity.
    IoT is an essential part of the smart agriculture architecture. With the integration
    of IoT devices, the agriculture systems have been monitored 24/7. These IoT devices
    sense the surrounding environment and physical parameters to take sensed information.
    Such sensed information is then sent to the backend server via Internet or through
    sensor gateway, where date is stored for future use or even user can view that
    sensed data. The user can make decisions about what actions to do in such a monitored
    environment. However, it’s not an easy task to integrate everyday devices with
    the Internet. Security is a big challenge faced by IoT, although each device has
    its unique set of characteristics and requirements. First of all, each person,
    device and system which is connected to the Internet must be identified. Intruders
    will acquire access to the network and perform security breaches if they do not
    have a valid identity. In case of smart agriculture systems, if information of
    sensors monitoring the agriculture parameters is leaked, lost or tampered with,
    it can render the products useless and damage their value significantly hence
    resulting in huge economic food loss. Therefore, developing a concrete framework
    for secure monitoring of smart agriculture with the adaption of IoT devices is
    an essential requirement of this era. Since IoT devices are designed to be compact
    and cost effective, because they have limited computing power and memory. Their
    resource constrained nature makes it difficult to secure them and has necessitated
    the development of lightweight application protocols and security suites. Instead
    of using standard TCP/IP protocols i.e., Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and
    Transport Layer Security (TLS), these devices use the IoT protocol stack, which
    is a lightweight version of the TCP/IP model specially designed for IoT devices.
    The CoAP has been standardized as lightweight application protocol for IoT systems.
    However, developing a low-overhead security solution for CoAP remains a challenge.
    Though some security protocols i.e., standard Datagram Transport Layer Security
    protocol (DTLS) exists. However, it is not suitable for IoT constrained devices
    and is expensive due to its computational overhead, complexity and lengthy cipher
    suites process. Therefore, this paper proposed a robust and lightweight secure
    authentication framework in CoAP using symmetric encryption i.e., Advanced Encryption
    System (AES) and HMAC-SHA-224. The main contribution of this paper is to design
    robust and tamper-resistant secure authentication framework for agriculture application
    using CoAP by ensuring data integrity and authenticity. The proposed CSFSA is
    implemented in Contiki NG and Cooja simulator and evaluated performances in terms
    of packet size, communication overhead and power consumption. The significance
    of proposed CSFSA is to make resilient against various cyber security attacks
    i.e., replay attacks, Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, resource exhaustion. The
    proposed CSFSA provides secure monitoring of various agriculture parameters remotely.
    The architecture of proposed CSFSA has three modules i.e., 6LoWPAN based internal
    network having IoT devices deployed in agriculture field for monitoring and controlling,
    a border router which acts as bridge between Internal network and external network
    i.e., Internet and a web server that provides access to the sensed data as shown
    in Figure 1. Figure 1. CSFSA architecture. The paper is structured as follows.
    Section 2 provides brief explanation of literature review that has been done in
    smart agriculture, IoT and CoAP security. Section 3 provides an in-depth overview
    of standards and protocols pertinent to our research work. Proposed methodology
    is presented in Section 4. Simulation and results evaluation is discussed in Section
    5. Finally, concluding remarks are given in Section 6. 2. Related Work This section
    provides the related literature that has been done in the field of CoAP security,
    IoT security, various authentication techniques used between IoT devices and agriculture
    sector. The Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application layer protocol
    used by the World Wide Web to access data on Internet and uses the Representational
    State Transfer (REST) architecture. The HTTP request and response messages exchange
    data between HTTP server and client [10]. This protocol is not suitable for IoT
    and cannot be implemented on IoT devices due to computational overhead. As a result,
    a lightweight and efficient protocol for constrained devices is required. The
    Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Constrained RESTful Environment (CoRE)
    working group has standardized lightweight application protocol for IoT systems
    i.e., CoAP. It is a specialized web transfer protocol, specially designed for
    resource constrained applications. In [11], the authors compared the CoAP and
    HTTP protocol and evaluated their performances based on energy consumption, battery
    life and amount of bytes exchanged per session as shown in Table 1. Table 1. HTTP
    and CoAP comparison based on resource consumption. Transport Layer Security (TLS)
    is used for securing HTTP communication over Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).
    The CoAP communication over User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is secured by using DTLS.
    However standard DTLS is not suitable for constrained networks due to its computational
    overhead, complexity and handshake session overhead. In [12], the authors provided
    brief overview of layered architecture of IoT and security vulnerabilities at
    each layer. They discussed in details various communication technologies along
    with their features and limitations which are being used by IoT applications.
    They also reviewed the existing security mechanisms with their limitations to
    secure the IoT environment. In [13], the authors presented two-way authentication
    scheme based on DTLS and RSA cryptographic algorithm. DTLS protocol is implemented
    in context of system architecture to achieve low overhead and high interoperability.
    However, due to the deployment of RSA encryption, the computational overhead required
    by their handshake process requires more energy. Shahid et al. [14] presented
    lightweight secure CoAP i.e., Lithe for securing IoT devices communication. This
    work provided secure framework by integrating CoAP and DTLS. The standard DTLS
    is not suitable for constrained devices. The proposed scheme used the DTLS header
    compression by leveraging 6LoWPAN standard and significantly reduced the energy
    consumption. The results showed that compressed DTLS performs better in terms
    of energy efficiency, network response time, packet size and processing time.
    In [15], the proposed framework enables the communication between android phones
    using DTLS secured CoAP. This framework combines other algorithms with DTLS that
    are not applicable on resource constrained IoT devices. DTLS requires public key
    cryptography which is a computationally expensive process and a lengthy handshake
    process [16]. Although there are certain security algorithms which are lightweight
    and have less overhead such as raw public key, at least 25 bytes per-packet overhead
    of DTLS takes up one-third of a frame. DTLS heavily hinders the performance in
    terms of round-trip messages when retrofitted to CoAP [17]. The authors Raza et
    al. [18], present a scheme for making the implementation secure CoAP lightweight
    by applying header compression techniques. Although header compression does not
    offer an improvement in performance because DTLS is computationally intensive.
    The authors Freeman et al. [19] propose a plan that enables the client to assign
    a certificate path and construction as well as the validation of the certification
    path to a server. However, this protocol is expected to be used over HTTP. This
    protocol relies on third-party instead of communication parties and adds a heavy
    communication overhead. In [13], a framework for the end-to-end security of IoT
    has been presented. The authors have used DTLS in combination with other standard
    protocols such as RSA. The use of RSA adds a high computational complexity and
    overhead to the network. In addition to that, the authentication handshake process
    in DTLS in which the client and server authenticate each other takes in excess
    of three round trips. Authors of [20] have suggested a technique for lightweight
    authentication using Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). In this technique, the
    client and server ensure the identity of the devices based on the message payload.
    During this process, a total of four messages are exchanged between the client
    and server. In [21] Park et al. have presented an implementation of an architecture
    that uses a delegation method to send and receive messages. In this implementation,
    a Secure Service Manager (SSM) is used in the handshake process. This system requires
    the SSM, sensors and trust manager to be located in a constrained network. Hence
    it may not be suitable for all kinds of IoT setups. In [22], Granjal et al. propose
    a plan for end-to-end security by using DTLS algorithm. This system uses the Elliptic
    Curve Cryptography (ECC) to encrypt data in resource constrained nodes. Although
    ECC consumes less power and memory compared to other public key encryption algorithms,
    it still uses up more resources than the symmetric key encryption algorithms [23].
    Using complex cipher suites for encryption results in high energy consumption.
    The authors have used a symmetric key cryptography algorithm, AES to replace DTLS
    in the authentication process. AES performs a four-way handshake between the CoAP
    based server and CoAP client. This process adds two header options in the CoAP
    packet for enabling secure mode. In [24], the authors present a scheme for the
    authentication between client and server by modifying the header of the CoAP packets.
    AES 128 is used for the encryption process and UDP protocol is used without DTLS
    in the transport layer. This scheme reduces the number of messages required for
    authentication between two parties without any loss in the overall efficiency.
    In [25], the various advantages of the new features of “Future Internet” are described,
    which greatly benefits farm management techniques. The “Future Internet” programme
    overcomes the limitations of the already existing Internet. These benefits include
    generic software modules that can be modified to build specific modules related
    to farming. The main architecture of the farm management system is specified,
    depending on which model is stored in the cloud. Tanmay Baranwal et al. [26] the
    main focus of this paper is to protect and secure agricultural goods from rodents
    and insects in storage units and fields. Real-time security systems are used,
    which provide notifications as soon as an issue is identified. Python scripts
    are used to integrate the various electronic devices and sensors. The algorithm
    of this system is based on data collection to achieve accuracy in alerting the
    user and starting the repellent. The system is tested in a 10 m², the device is
    fixed in a corner during the testing. As the PIR sensor senses heat, it immediately
    starts the URD sensor and starts video recording through a webcam. The accuracy
    achieved from these test cases reaches up to 84.8%. It will be beneficial to incorporate
    the security system in storage units to prevent rodents from attacking the goods.
    LIU Dan et al. [27] this paper emphasizes on the role of greenhouse technology
    in the agricultural field and presents the design and development of an environment
    monitoring system. This system makes use of ZigBee technology and CC2530 chip.
    Data collection, processing and communication by the wireless sensors and nodes
    is done by using the CC2530F256 core. The proposed monitoring system gives real-time
    information to the user regarding different parameters such as temperature control
    and fan condition etc. This system utilizes intelligent greenhouse monitoring
    and control techniques and helps the farmers to produce balanced and scientific
    crops. Nikesh Gondchawar et al. [28] proposes a smart agriculture system based
    on IoT and automation techniques. The proposed system uses a remotely controllable
    robot based on GPS to execute tasks such as weeding, spraying pesticides and monitoring
    moisture levels etc. The proposed system also incorporates smart irrigation techniques
    through intelligent decision making based on real-time data from the fields. In
    addition to that, it also includes smart warehouse management modules. It observes
    the temperature, humidity as well as theft detection in the warehouse. The system
    architecture includes various sensors, cameras, ZigBee devices, actuators with
    microcontrollers and Raspberry Pi. This system alerts the user regarding irrigation
    and storage problems and uses a remotely controllable robot for smart irrigation
    and warehouse management. Agostino Forestiero [29] proposes an activity footprints
    based method to detect anomalies in IoT by exploiting a multiagent algorithm.
    The method allows real-valued vectors to be used to map sequences of specific
    device activity (digital footprints). The vectors are given to mobile agents,
    who act according to a modified bio-inspired model for each of them. On the basis
    of simple local movement rules observed by all agents onto a virtual 2D space,
    this model allows intelligent global behaviour to evolve. In [30], the authors
    proposes an agent-based algorithm for achieving a distributed resources organization
    in an IoT environment. In order to map the IoT objects, a natural language processing
    approach was used, which was able to capture the semantic context and represent
    things with high-dimensional vectors, allowing advanced agents to operate. In
    a highly dynamic and, essentially, unstructured environment, the growing organised
    virtual structure, i.e., a similarity-based overlay network of agents, allows
    for the development of informed resource selection/discovery services, making
    them more efficient. The approach’s validity has been confirmed by preliminary
    results. Marco Lombardi et al. [31] proposed a preliminary study case of a probabilistic
    approach in an intrusion detection system over the CAN-bus to guarantee cyber
    security inside connected vehicles. An innovative two-step detection algorithm
    has been used to exploit both the variation of the status parameters of the various
    ECUs over time and the Bayesian networks which can identify a possible attack.
    Starting from a domain analysis is possible to find out what are the parameters
    of interests and how these are related to each other. Marco Lombardi et al. [3]
    provided brief overview of IoT regarding current architectures, technologies,
    protocols, and applications. They discussed in details various applications which
    is based on IoT i.e., smart Cities, smart roads, and smart industries. Exiting
    security protocols i.e., standard Datagram Transport Layer Security protocol (DTLS)
    is not suitable for IoT constrained devices and is expensive due to its computational
    overhead, complexity and lengthy cipher suites process. However, the DTLS protocol
    needs to be modified in such a way that it’s feasible for resource constrained
    devices. Hence, researchers are looking for alternative security frameworks to
    replace DTLS. In this research work, we propose a lightweight and robust authentication
    framework for agriculture application and evaluate its performance to show that
    it is feasible for constrained IoT devices. 3. Background This section provides
    an in-depth description of IoT layered architecture, CoAP architecture, proposed
    framework architecture, standard and protocols related to our research work. 3.1.
    Iot Protocol Stack Development The IoT protocol stack is a critical component
    of IoT technology because it allows hardware to communicate data in a structured
    and useful way. In recent years, the IoT has seen an uptick in a variety of applications,
    such as smart homes, smart health, smart agriculture, and smart logistics, where
    each application has its own properties and resource requirements, as well as
    its own protocols to match its objectives [32]. IoT protocols are classified based
    on the role they play in the network. Table 2 shows the logical layering of protocol
    hierarchies used in network communications nowadays. The following is a comparison
    of the protocols for each layer in the protocol stack to determine which one is
    best for the smart agriculture scenario in terms of efficiency and productivity.
    Table 2. IoT Communication Protocols. 3.1.1. Application Layer Protocols Comparison
    CoAP, MQTT, MQTT-SN, and XMPP are the most often used application layer protocols
    in IoT. The following paragraphs offer a comparative review to choose an ideal
    application layer protocol for smart agriculture based on their advantages and
    limitations. Constrained Application protocol (CoAP) is a web transfer protocol
    that is designed to be a lightweight version of HTTP based on Representational
    State Transfer (REST). CoAP runs over UDP, eliminating most of the TCP overhead
    of HTTP, decreasing the bandwidth requirements, providing more simplicity, and
    makes it more appropriate for smart agriculture applications. CoAP is built upon
    the request/response model and supports methods such as GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE
    as well as unicast and multicast transmission. CoAP is efficient in terms of infrastructure,
    bandwidth and power usage [33]. Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) is
    another protocol designed for resource constraint devices by IBM. It is based
    on an asynchronous publish/subscribe protocol that runs over TCP. The message
    pattern in MQTT includes a broker, publisher and subscriber. The broker is tasked
    with controlling and distributing of data packets between subscribers and publishers.
    The addition of TCP makes it much more reliable, however it adds more latency
    and causes a higher bandwidth and power consumption. Hence, it is not recommended
    for real time applications. MQTT-SN is a modified version of MQTT, designed especially
    for sensor networks. It uses UDP instead of TCP to minimize the drawbacks of MQTT
    but its core infrastructure is the same as MQTT. The main difference between the
    two is that, MQTT-SN requires a gateway to translate all MQTT-SN messages over
    UDP to MQTT messages over TCP. Currently, this functionality is integrated within
    the brokers [34]. This extra step for the interpretation of messages, adds complexity
    to the overall framework hence increases power consumption. The Extensible Messaging
    and Presence Protocol (XMPP) is designed to allow short messages and low latency,
    making it ideal for IoT communications. The XMPP protocol may handle both request/response
    and publish/subscribe formats, which allow for bidirectional and multidirectional
    communication, respectively. The decentralised nature of XMPP allows for high
    scalability [35]. The XMPP protocol use XML for communication, which increases
    network traffic. This results in high bandwidth use, high CPU usage, and no guarantee
    of QoS. The comparative analysis of various application layer protocols show that
    CoAP generates less overhead than the other protocols. In terms of power consumption,
    bandwidth and infrastructure requirements and is most suitable for the proposed
    CSFSA framework. 3.1.2. Network Layer Protocols Comparison Some of the most used
    network layer protocols used in IoT applications are IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless
    Personal Area Network (6LoWPAN), ZigBee and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). A comparative
    review of these network layer protocol is given as follows: 6LoWPAN is based on
    IP version 6 (IPv6), it features 128-bit hexadecimal addresses, and uses the 802.15.4
    radio frequency. It enables the use of IP in low-power and lossy wireless networks,
    such as WSNs (Wireless Sensor Networks), IoT (Internet of Things) and M2M applications.
    One of the most unique characteristics of 6LoWPAN is that it allows header compression
    and encapsulation, making it more lightweight and secure than ZigBee. The most
    notable advantage of 6LoWPAN is that it supports IP networks natively [36]. The
    ZigBee protocol is based on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard, which allows for less
    battery consumption in IoT networks by keeping nodes in low power mode for the
    most part. However, unlike 6LoWPAN, which has interoperability, ZigBee cannot
    readily communicate with other protocols. Bluetooth 5 is the latest version of
    BLE. It supports IP networks however, BLE is unable to establish a self-healing
    mesh network, which is becoming particularly crucial for IoT applications. An
    additional gateway is required to communicate with the internet when utilizing
    ZigBee or classic Bluetooth, which adds extra overhead. It can be deduced from
    the above discussion that due to its compression and encapsulation capabilities,
    interoperability and low network overhead, 6LoWPAN is the prime option for the
    proposed CSFSA framework. 3.1.3. Link Layer Protocols Comparison There are three
    main link layer protocols present for IoT applications, IEEE 802.15.4 for 6LoWPAN
    and ZigBee, IEEE 802.11 for Wi-Fi. and IEEE 802.15.1 for Bluetooth. A brief analysis
    of the above mentioned protocols is given below: IEEE 802.15.4 is a low-power
    wireless network standard developed by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics
    Engineers (IEEE). It has a communication range of at least 10 metres and up to
    100 metres. The 802.15.4 category is the dominant standard for low data-rate and
    security in Wireless Personal Area Networks (WPAN). IEEE standards for wireless
    communications WLANs/Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi) are 802.11 networks with communication
    ranges varying from 40 to 90 metres. Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11) is inefficient in terms
    of battery life, does not cover a vast area, and does not support a large number
    of end devices. Bluetooth, i.e., 802.15.1, is another WPANs standard specified
    by the 802.15 group, with a communication range of 10 metres to 50 metres. It
    is more power efficient but less encrypted compared to Wi-Fi [37]. From the comparison
    it is determined that IEEE 802.15.4 is the best fit for the proposed CSFSA framework
    because it is compatible with 6LoWPAN, provides more security, consumes less power
    and has a higher communication range compared to the other protocols. Based on
    the comparison of several protocols at different layers, the IoT protocol stack
    for proposed CSFSA framework is presented in Figure 2. Figure 2. IoT protocol
    stack for CSFSA. 3.2. Coap Architecture The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)
    is a specialized web transfer protocol, specially designed for constrained applications.
    The CoAP’s interactive client/server model is similar to HTTP model. It has similar
    features and principles as in HTTP. Due to higher communication overhead of HTTP
    and HTTPS, such protocols are not suitable for IoT communication. Therefore, CoAP
    is designed to interface with HTTP, to easily integrate with existing web-browsers,
    while ensuring constrained networks and M2M [38,39] specialized requirements i.e.,
    multicast support, simplicity, and low message overhead. The IETF Constrained
    RESTful Environment (CoRE) working group standardized CoAP protocol. It is designed
    according to the Representational State Transfer (REST) architecture. CoAP supported
    multicast requests, asynchronous communication, content type and congestion control,
    cashing and proxy abilities. The CoAP packet format has a 4 bytes fixed size header
    as shown in Figure 3. Figure 3. CoAP packet format. The CoAP architecture has
    message layer and request/response layer as shown in Figure 4. The message layer
    handles the message exchange over UDP between end points. It deals with reliability
    and asynchronous mechanism. While request/response layer deals with request and
    response messages and their mapping. CoAP has four types of messages i.e., Confirmable
    (requires an acknowledgement), Non-Confirmable (needed no acknowledgement), Acknowledgement
    (receipt of confirmable message), Reset (confirmable or non-confirmable message
    not processed properly), Piggy-backed (sends Acknowledgement with confirmable
    message). The CoAP used same methods i.e., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE for generating,
    restoring, creating or updating and deleting processes as like HTTP. The CoAP
    protocol lacks trusted standards for secure architecture and its messages are
    encrypted by using DTLS, which was not designed for resource constrained devices
    and hence is not suited for CoAP [40]. Figure 4. CoAP architecture. 3.3. Proposed
    Robust and Tamper-Resistant Authentication Framework In most of the IoT applications,
    CoAP is utilized as an application layer protocol. CoAP does not provide any security
    for data transmission between two constrained nodes. The CoAP server and client
    communication can be secured with DTLS, however, as mentioned in the preceding
    section, DTLS is not suitable for IoT constrained devices and it causes computational
    overhead and complexity on constrained nodes. Therefore, robust and tamper-resistant
    authentication framework between CoAP server and client is proposed to ensure
    data integrity and authenticity. The proposed CSFSA framework is computationally
    efficient and is resilient against various cyber security attacks i.e., replay
    attacks, DoS attacks and resource exhaustion. It avoids the need to develop the
    additional security protocol. Like HTTP, CoAP is based on client/server model
    architecture to establish connection when client sends request to server and server
    sends response to the client. For observation of resources, all the server and
    clients used the CoAP protocol. In order to observe resource, the server first
    authenticates the client identity. If the client is authentic, the server will
    establish session with that client and will respond to the client. On the client
    side while receiving response message from server, the client checks the server
    authenticity. Once both client and server are authenticated, they proceed and
    exchange data between them. The proposed CSFSA framework uses the AES encryption
    techniques and hash based message authentication code algorithm HMAC-SHA-224 by
    ensuring message integrity and authenticity. Before starting communication, the
    CoAP client and server first agree on sequence ID and pre-shared secret key Kpre.
    The server stores each device sequence ID and Kpre in its own repository for device
    identification and to fetch associated Kpre for that device. Now whenever client
    wants to start communication with server, it will send request to server, after
    receiving request from server, server will check client authenticity first. Figure
    5 shows the proposed CSFSA authentication architecture. On the client side, the
    server verifies and authenticate the client identity. The client first generates
    timestamp T1 in order to prevent from replay attacks and calculates hash value
    of Kpre and T1 using HMAC-SHA-224 hash algorithm. This hash value is then concatenated
    with the device sequence ID and T1 as follow: H C =HMAC( K pre ,T1) (1) C MP =ID||T1||
    H C (2) where CMP is the client message payload. The client then sends its final
    message CMP to the server. Figure 5. Proposed CSFSA authentication framework.
    On the server side, while receiving message from client, the server checks client
    message authenticity. The server first checks the sequence ID in its repository,
    if it’s not present in repository, the connection will be then rejected, otherwise
    server will fetch associated Kpre for that device in its repository. The server
    then generates its own hash value of Kpre and T1 as follow: H S =HMAC( K pre ,T1)
    (3) where HS is the server hash value. The server compares its own generated hash
    value HS with the received hash value HC from the client. If both hash values
    are not same, the server then rejects the client request. If both values are same,
    then the server authenticates client for services. Once client is authenticated
    by server, the server creates reply message for the message received from authentic
    client. Therefore, the server generates timestamp T2 and session key KS. The server
    encrypts KS and T2 using Kpre and AES encryption algorithm and calculate the hash
    value of Kpre and T2 using HMAC-SHA-224 hash algorithm as follows: EM= E K pre
    (KS,T2) (4) H′ 𝑆 =HMAC( K pre ,T2) (5) The server sends H’S along with encrypted
    message EM and T2 to the client. Upon receiving message from server, the client
    generates the hash value HMAC (Kpre, T2) and compares both own generated hash
    value and received hash value. If both hash values are not same, the client terminates
    the connection. If both are same, the server is authenticated and the client then
    decrypts the received encrypted message EM using Kpre and AES encryption algorithm
    to obtain session key KS. H′ 𝐶 =HMAC( K pre ,T2) (6) DM= D K pre (EM) (7) In this
    way, the sensitive agriculture data is being encrypted and decrypted between the
    server and client with the help of using this session key KS. 4. Methodology This
    research work aims to develop robust and tamper-resistant authentication framework
    for monitoring and controlling of IoT devices in smart agriculture. The architecture
    of proposed CSFSA consists of three modules such as internal network i.e., 6LoWPAN
    based IoT network, external network and gateway which acts as bridge between internal
    and external network. The complete proposed CSFSA is developed and emulated in
    Contiki-NG operating system and Cooja simulator. Various steps of methodology
    are briefly explained in the following subsections. 4.1. Description of Proposed
    CSFSA Framework This is the first phase where we will define and explain the structure
    of proposed CSFSA. The proposed CSFSA consists of personal computer where VMWare
    is installed. On VMWare, Ubuntu is installed for Contiki-NG operating system where
    Cooja simulator and Wireshark is used for framework development and analysis of
    result. Cooja is a useful simulator for Contiki-NG development, as it provides
    simulation environment by allowing developers to simulate and test code/system
    before running it on the actual hardware. The proposed framework has three modules
    i.e., 6LoWPAN based internal network having IoT devices deployed in agriculture
    field for monitoring and controlling, a gateway which acts as bridge between IoT
    and external network i.e., Internet and a web server. 4.2. Design and Development
    of Proposed CSFSA Framework This is the second phase which is based on design
    and development. The comprehensive activity diagram for CSFSA is as shown in Figure
    6. First step is to open Cooja simulation, then radio propagation model is selected
    i.e., Unit Disk Graph Medium-distance loss (UDGM-Distance Loss). The Unit Disk
    Graph Radio Medium abstracts radio transmission range as circles. Two different
    range parameters are used i.e., one for transmission and one for interfering with
    other radios and transmission. Figure 6. Activity diagram for design and development.
    The next step is the selection of mote i.e., sky mote is selected having 10 KB
    of RAM. On one sky mote, CoAP server is compiled for communication within agriculture
    field (internal network) and is secured by deploying proposed CSFSA. While Routing
    Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) border router is compiled on another
    sky mote for connectivity with external network. The next step is to create bridge
    between border router and external network. To enable that bridge, need to open
    serial socket server on the border router through “Listening on port 60001”. In
    this way, RPL network is created. Now to connect this RPL network to the external
    network, tunslip utility is used which is provided in Contiki-NG. Tunslip creates
    a bridge between RPL network and local machine i.e., 127.0.0.1 as shown in Figure
    7. Figure 7. Tunslip connectivity. To initiate border router connection, open
    a new terminal in Contiki and type the following commands (shown in Figure 8):
    Figure 8. Border router connectivity with external network. cd Contiki/examples/ipv6/rpl-border-router/
    make connect-router-cooja Finally, Copper (Cu) based CoAP user agent is installed
    for communication with web server which is then opened in browser for control
    and monitoring of IoT devices in smart agriculture. The Copper CoAP user agent
    is an add-on for the Firefox web browser, used for browsing and direct interaction
    with CoAP resources. 4.3. Operation and Procedure of Proposed CSFSA Framework
    In this phase, the operation of proposed CSFSA is presented in 3 primary modules
    such as the internal network i.e., IoT devices, border router and external network
    i.e., internet as illustrated in Figure 9. The framework’s procedure and operation
    ratify the proposed IoT protocol stack which includes IoT devices that use CoAP
    at the application layer, a border router that uses 6LoWPAN at the network layer
    and IEEE 802.15.4 radio at the link layer and a web server that uses a Copper-based
    CoAP client. The RPL border router acts as bridge that connects external network
    with 6LoWPAN based internal network. The proposed framework connects CoAP based
    IoT devices to the internet via 6LoWPAN border router. Figure 9. Operation of
    proposed CSFSA. 5. Results Evaluation and Discussion To appraise the performance
    of proposed CSFSA, the CSFSA is emulated in Contiki NG operating system and Cooja
    simulator. Contiki NG is an open source operating system which is designed especially
    for memory constrained systems. Cooja is an open source simulator which is used
    for the development of Contiki NG, as it provides simulation environment by allowing
    developers to simulate and test code/system before running it on the actual hardware.
    5.1. Simulation Parameters The simulation parameters used for the implementation
    of CSFSA is shown in Table 3. The mote chosen for simulation is Wismote which
    is MSP430 microcontroller based board having 16 KB of RAM and 256 KB of flash
    memory and a radio chip CC2420 compatible with IEEE 802.15.4 standard. The protocols
    used in the simulation are CoAP as an application layer protocol, UDP as transport
    layer protocol, 6LoWPAN as network layer protocol and IEEE 802.15.4 as link layer
    protocol. Table 3. Simulation parameters. 5.2. Scenario Development In order to
    evaluate the CSFSA’s performance, it is divided into two simulation scenarios
    i.e., CoAP with proposed CSFSA and CoAP-DTLS implementation scenarios. CoAP with
    proposed CSFSA scenario comprised of 5 motes and 1 border router. Here motes are
    CoAP servers which are developed on proposed IoT protocol stack and deployed in
    agriculture field for control and monitoring of various agriculture parameters.
    The mote 1 is the border router while motes 2–6 running CoAP servers and all the
    motes are placed in the transmission range of border router. The border router
    is used for connectivity with external network (internet) through tunslip utility.
    The purpose of CoAP servers are monitoring and controlling of environmental conditions
    of agriculture field and send it to remote server i.e., CoAP client application.
    The CoAP client is Cupper based browser which is used for browsing and direct
    interaction with CoAP resources. The CoAP with proposed CSFSA scenario is emulated
    in Cooja as shown in Figure 10. While in CoAP-DTLS scenario, mote 1 is border
    router and motes 2–6 are CoAP servers and all the motes are placed in the transmission
    range of border router as shown in Figure 11. The CoAP-DTLS scenario is used for
    results comparison with proposed CSFSA framework based CoAP. Figure 10. Proposed
    CSFSA simulation scenario consisting of 1 border router and 5 CoAP motes. Figure
    11. CoAP-DTLS simulation scenario consisting of 1 border router and 5 CoAP motes.
    5.3. Results This section describes the simulation results obtained. We appraised
    the results of proposed CSFSA in terms of performance evaluation parameters i.e.,
    packet size, communication overhead and power consumption. The packet size is
    an important evaluation parameter and have a significant impact on power consumption
    particularly in constrained networks. For message transmission, the standard CoAP
    requires one round trip. In proposed CSFSA framework, the authentication messages
    require two round trips as compared to CoAP-DTLS scheme, which processes it in
    four round trips i.e., three round trips for DTLS and one round trip for CoAP.
    Proposed CSFSA is lightweight and power efficient as compared to CoAP-DTLS and
    has significantly smaller packet size than CoAP-DTLS. Figure 12 illustrates the
    packet size and the number of messages for both proposed CSFSA framework and CoAP-DTLS
    scheme during transmission. Figure 12. Packet size. From the figure, it is clear
    that the packet size for our proposed CSFSA is smaller than that of packet size
    of CoAP-DTLS. Also the round trip time of our proposed CSFSA is lower as compared
    to round trip time of CoAP-DTLS. Communication overhead is defined as the number
    of extra messages or packets that has been transmitted over network. The Standard
    CoAP communication overhead does not include extra packets for data transfer.
    The DTLS adds extra communication overhead to secure CoAP. To establish DTLS secure
    session, it adds 29 bytes to each datagram i.e., 8 bytes nonce and 8 bytes authentication
    tag. In CoAP-DTLS, DTLS handshake adds extra 29 bytes as overhead to standard
    CoAP. In our proposed CSFSA, it requires only two extra bytes communication overhead
    to the total number of transmitted bytes to secure the communication between client
    and server. Figure 13 shows the communication overhead for both proposed CSFSA
    and CoAP-DTLS scheme. Based on comparison, communication overhead in our proposed
    CSFSA is lower as compared to CoAP-DTLS. Its means that our proposed CSFSA is
    efficient and has lightweight communication overhead. Figure 13. Communication
    overhead comparison. Power consumption is another important metric, as it directly
    impacts the lifetime of IoT devices since IoT devices are powered by small sized
    batteries. Proposed CSFSA is lightweight and has significantly smaller packet
    size than CoAP-DTLS. Hence, it consumes less power and bandwidth as compared to
    CoAP-DTLS. The power consumption of proposed CSFSA is measured through software
    based energy estimation tool called Energest which is built in Contiki NG OS.
    The function energest_type_time () outputs the clock ticks obtained from the time
    when IoT device is booted. The formula for measuring the power consumption is
    as follows: PowerConsumption= EnergestValue×Current×Voltage RTIMER_ARCH_SECOND×RunTime
    (8) where current, voltage and RTIMER_ARCH_SECOND are constant, taken from Wismote
    datahseet. Figure 14 shows the power consumption measured for both proposed CSFSA
    and CoAP-DTLS scheme. Figure 14. Power consumption. 6. Conclusions Agriculture
    plays an important role in country’s economic growth. In agriculture, the yields
    or crops which are to be produced are sensitive to changes in their environmental
    conditions and required controlled environment. Conventional agriculture methods
    are not integrated with IoT devices to provide controlled environment, resulting
    in low crop and fruit yields. This necessitates the integration of IoT technology
    in agriculture field to boost crop productivity. However, the integration of IoT
    in agriculture field introduces cyber security attacks and vulnerabilities. Such
    cyber attacks have the capability to adversely affect the countries’ economies
    that are heavily reliant on agriculture. On the other hand, these IoT devices
    are resource constrained having limited memory and power capabilities and cannot
    be secured using conventional cyber security protocols. Therefore, designing robust
    and efficient secure framework for smart agriculture are required and is main
    aim of this paper. In this paper, a Cyber Secured Framework for Smart Agriculture
    (CSFSA) is proposed. The proposed CSFSA presented a robust and tamper resistant
    authentication scheme for IoT devices using CoAP to ensure the data integrity
    and authenticity of smart agriculture monitoring. The significance of proposed
    CSFSA is to make resilient against various cyber security attacks i.e., replay
    attacks, Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, resource exhaustion and is efficient
    for constrained devices having limited memory. Furthermore, the packet size, communication
    overhead and energy consumption are also computed to appraise efficiency of proposed
    CSFSA framework. As a result, the proposed CSFSA can make a significant contribution
    to the problem of food wastage and its security. Also the economic loss can be
    reduced greatly. Author Contributions Conceptualization, W.U.K., S.A. (Saleh Alyahya)

  key_findings: The proposed CSFSA framework is lightweight, efficient, and resilient
    against various cyber security attacks, making it suitable for resource-constrained
    IoT devices in smart agriculture monitoring systems.

  description: Large river basins present significant challenges for water resource
    planning and management. They typically traverse a wide range of hydroclimatic
    regimes, are characterized by complex and variable hydrology, and span multiple
    jurisdictions with diverse water demands and values. They are often data-poor
    and in many developing economies are characterized by weak water governance. Rapid
    global change is seeing significant changes to the pressures on the water resources
    of large basins, exacerbating the challenge of sustainable water management. Diverse
    technologies have long supported water resource planning and development, from
    data collection, analytics, simulation, to decision-making, and real-time operations.
    In the last two decades however, a rapid increase in the range, capability, and
    accessibility of new technologies, coupled with large reductions in cost, mean
    there are increasing opportunities for emerging technologies to significantly
    “disrupt” traditional approaches to water resources management. In this paper,
    we consider the application of ‘disruptive technologies’ in water resources management
    in large river basins, through a lens of improving water security. We discuss
    the role of different actors and institutions for water management considering
    a range of emerging disruptive technologies. We consider the risks and benefits
    associated with the use of these technologies and discuss the barriers to their
    widespread adoption. We obverse a positive trend away from the reliance solely
    on centralized government institutions and traditional modeling for the collection
    and analysis of data, towards a more open and dynamic ‘data and knowledge ecosystem’
    that draws upon data services at different levels (global to local) to support
    water planning and operations. We expect that technological advances and cost
    reductions will accelerate, fueling increased incremental adoption of new technologies
    in water resources planning and management. Large-basin analytics could become
    virtually free for users with global, regional, and national development agencies
    absorbing the costs of development and any subscription services for end users
    (e.g., irrigators) to help improve water management at user level and improve
    economic productivity. Collectively, these changes can help to ‘democratize’ water
    management through improved access to data and information. However, disruptive
    technologies can also be deployed in top-down or centralized processes, and so
    their use is sometimes contested or misunderstood. Increased attention therefore
    needs to be given to ensuring equity in technology access, and to strengthening
    the governance context for technology deployment. Widespread adoption of disruptive
    technologies will require adjustments to how water professionals are trained,
    increased adaptiveness in water resources planning and operations, and careful
    consideration of privacy and cybersecurity issues.

    management is a major and growing global issue for economic development and poverty
    reduction [1,2]. Water is essential for food and energy security [3,4], and water-related
    extremes of flood and droughts have significant economic and social costs [5,6].
    With increasing global population and economic development, demand for water and
    competition between uses and users are on the rise [7,8]. Global water consumption
    is estimated to have increased by 40 percent in the last four decades [8], mostly
    for irrigation, which represents 70 percent of total global water withdrawals
    [9]. While everyone depends on freshwater, the importance of groundwater is often
    overlooked; for example, groundwater provides drinking water for 1.5–3.0 billion
    people [10]. The current level of global water withdrawals is approaching a planetary
    boundary, which if crossed would take the Earth system outside a safe operating
    space for humanity [11]. As result of these pressures, an estimated 4 billion
    people experience severe water scarcity for at least one month of the year [12].
    Local water availability constraints, rapid population growth and urbanization,
    inadequate infrastructure, and governance shortcomings [13] mean nearly 0.7 billion
    people lack access to a safely managed drinking water supply [14]. Accelerating
    climate change is perturbing the global water cycle [15], altering the average
    patterns of water availability and increasing the magnitude and frequency of water-related
    extremes in parts of the world. These changes, however, are uncertain and still
    poorly understood [15,16,17,18]. Climate change increases the uncertainty in projections
    of water supply and demand, and increases the uncertainty in feasibility and economic
    performance assessments of water infrastructure [19,20]. 1.1. Large River Basins—Character
    and Importance There is no widely accepted criterion for defining “large river
    basins”, either in terms of drainage area or total discharge. Basins exceeding
    100,000 km2 in area—of which there are an estimated 130 or so globally (including
    22 exceeding 1,000,000 km2)—could reasonably be considered large. However, rather
    than use an arbitrary criterion such, we adopt a looser definition that also includes
    geographically smaller basins where water management challenges are considered
    ‘large’, because of one or more of: (i) hydrologic complexity (high flows, hydrologic
    variability, non-stationarity, surface-groundwater interactions, multiple water
    sources—rainfall-runoff, snow, glacier melt); (ii) water management complexity
    (large population, supply-demand imbalance, inter-sectoral competition, rapid
    demand growth, pollution, high flood and erosion risk, climate change vulnerability),);
    and (iii) administrative complexity (transboundary coordination or conflict; federate-state-local
    coordination or conflict; governance complexity—intersecting legal, policy, regulatory
    frameworks). Aside from remote and sparsely populated basins in northern Canada
    and Russia, most of the geographically largest river basins in the world are also
    international transboundary basins. A total of 286 river international transboundary
    river basins have been identified (spanning 151 countries and home to more than
    40 percent of the global population); 80 percent of the total area and population
    of the transboundary basins is associated with the largest 156 basins [21]. Larger
    river basins tend to have a higher economic dependence on water resources, and
    the 14 basins with the greater economic dependence on water are home to almost
    50 percent of the population of all transboundary basins—nearly 1.4 billion people
    [21]. In addition to international transboundary rivers, large basins within federal
    countries—such as the Murray–Darling in Australia—represent complex resource management
    challenges [22]. As well as the economic importance and the associated social
    values of large river basins, these systems are critical habitat for freshwater
    biodiversity. Rivers, lakes, and other ‘wetlands’ occupy just 0.8 percent of the
    Earth’s surface but support 6 percent of all described species including 35 percent
    of all vertebrates [23], especially fish. Large rivers with higher flow volumes
    tend to support more fish species, and tropical rivers tend to have higher levels
    of species richness. The highest levels of riverine fish species richness are
    found in the Amazon, Orinoco, Tocantins, and the Paraná in South America; the
    Congo, the Niger Delta, and the Ogooue in Africa; and the Yangtze, Pearl, Brahmaputra,
    Ganges, Mekong, Chao Phraya, Sittang, and Irrawaddy in Asia [24]. Large rivers
    are also especially important for freshwater megafauna with slow life-history
    strategies and complex habitat requirements [25]. Globally, freshwater megafauna
    populations declined by 88% from 1970 to 2012, with mega-fishes exhibiting the
    greatest global decline (−94%) [25]. These major biodiversity declines highlight
    the conflicts between economic development and environmental protection and conservation
    in large river basins. Large river basins present particular challenges and opportunities
    for the use of emerging technologies in support of water resources management.
    Geographically, large basins typically traverse a wide range of hydroclimatic
    regimes, and processes that characterize basin-scale hydrological behavior take
    place at multiple scales. These give rise to technical challenges for the design
    and operation of hydrometeorological data collection systems, including the integration
    of ground-based and remote observations. Because they often span multiple jurisdictions—within
    and, or between countries—large basins have institutional complexities for coordinated
    data collection, sharing and analysis, as well as for decision making and for
    coordinated real-time operational management. 1.2. Water Security as an Objective
    for IWRM Integrated water resources management (IWRM) has been vigorously promoted
    by the international development community as a set of principles and a best practice
    process for planning and managing water resources [26]. IWRM has also however,
    been strongly criticized from both technical standpoints (for being too vague
    to have real utility for practical implementation [27]) and from political economy
    standpoints (having been dubbed “soft coercive hegemony” [28]). We find that accepting
    some key principles of IWRM (e.g., water systems focus, data/analytical foundation,
    participatory planning) but shifting to a medium-long term ‘water security’ outcome
    focus, helps to better define desired economic, social and environmental outcomes
    from water, and identify specific interventions to help achieve these. ‘Water
    security’ is thus conceptualized as the relationships between the water endowment,
    the water sector architecture (institutions and infrastructure), water sector
    performance (resource management, service delivery and risk mitigation) and the
    outcomes from how water is managed and used (Figure 1). A recent example of the
    application of this conceptualization is a comprehensive water security diagnostic
    for Pakistan [29]. Figure 1. Conceptual framework for water security. Water resources
    management is integral to sustainable development. In 2015, all 193 Member States
    of the United Nations General Assembly agreed to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
    Development and established 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This is a
    plan to “end poverty in all its forms” and to “shift the world to a sustainable
    and resilient path”. SDG 6—Ensure availability and sustainable management of water
    and sanitation for all—considers not just water supply and sanitation services,
    but also water scarcity and water use efficiency, water quality and wastewater
    treatment, water ecosystems, as well as institutional aspects of water resources
    management (including IWRM implementation) and cooperation [30]. Other aspects
    of water security (such as water-related disasters) are captured by other SDGs.
    In this paper, we review the application of “disruptive technologies” in water
    resources management in large river basins, through this water security lens.
    We consider how these technologies can assist delivering better outcomes or deliver
    outcomes more efficiently or cost effectively. We discuss the roles of different
    actors and institutions, and consider risks associated with the adoption of these
    technologies and the barriers to widespread adoption. 1.3. Role of Technology
    in Water Management Technology has multiple roles in water management, across
    the spheres of infrastructure design, systems planning, real-time operations.
    These can be considered in a matrix with the key areas of water resource management,
    irrigation management, water supply (and treatment) and sanitation, and environmental
    water management. Here, we focus on decision making—at both planning and operational
    time scales—for water resources management. This includes river basin planning;
    water allocation planning; flood and drought outlooks, forecasts and warnings;
    and the real-time operational management of water resources infrastructure. However,
    these boundaries are not tightly delineated, and many of the technologies discussed
    have application into other aspects of water management as well. For these selected
    focal areas of water resources management, we consider how ‘data’ is transformed
    into ‘information’ and then ‘knowledge’, and how these are then used in decision
    making for action. Along this ‘value chain’, we thus consider the collection,
    transmission, storage, management, and sharing of data. Then the ways in which
    data is transformed into information and thence into knowledge, and how information
    and knowledge are stored, managed, shared, visualized, and otherwise communicated.
    We consider the decision process and the roles of multiple actors in this process,
    and how decisions are communicated and then actioned. Beyond the ‘hydro-informatics’
    elements of technology, there are innovative technologies for operations and stakeholder
    interaction. With respect to SDG 6, a brief introduction to some technology opportunities
    is provided by [31,32]. 2. Disruptive Technologies Disruptive technology is commonly
    defined as “technology that can fundamentally change not only established technologies
    but also the rules and business models of a given market, and often business and
    society overall”; the term (and concept) was first introduced in the mid-1990s
    by Harvard Business School scholars in the context of business innovation [33].
    Disruptive technologies are now showing much promise in every field of development
    [34]. The evolution of these technologies is accelerating and disrupting traditional
    approaches to water planning and management. The key relevant technologies are
    summarized in Table 1 with implications on their application to water resource
    management in large river basins. Table 1. Summary of disruptive technologies
    relevant to water management in large basins. 2.1. Technology Evolution Technological
    evolution has influenced the use of water resources for millennia. However, in
    recent years, there has been an acceleration in the development of new tools and
    technologies of relevance for water resources management (Figure 2). Many factors,
    however, affect the adoption of emerging technologies, including institutional
    capacity, the enabling policy and institutional environment, resource availability,
    competing priorities, access to global good practice, intellectual property, and
    the agility of governments, the private sector, academia, and other actors. These
    factors have meant heterogeneous but overall slow uptake and diffusion of new
    technologies. Some technologies that were deployed in the developed world more
    than a century ago, are only now being adopted across the developing world. However,
    much of the developing world has a ‘last mover’ advantage, with the potential
    to leapfrog old ways and adopt new approaches more rapidly than the developmental
    paradigm allowed in the developed world. While there have been many challenges
    in leapfrogging in some areas, including for environmental sustainability and
    indeed for river basin management [35], information and communication technology
    leapfrogging is beginning to show real impact in spite of “tech transfer” and
    “absorptive capacity” issues [36], including through rapid adoption of mobile
    technologies and leveraging the large data sets generated by some developing countries
    [37]. Figure 2. Timeline of water technology evolution. Here, we classify disruptive
    technologies according to where they can be most disruptive: (i) decision-making,
    (ii) operations, and (iii) stakeholder interaction (Figure 3). Figure 3. Typology
    of ‘disruptive’ technologies. 2.2. Technology Appplications Traditional investments
    in water resources in the developing world have seldom been conceived, implemented,
    or operated from a holistic multi-sectoral basin perspective. They often are based
    on old technologies and have high operational and maintenance costs that are seldom
    met, leading to poor service delivery exacerbated by deferred maintenance as they
    age. Even basic monitoring data are usually not accessible in real-time and require
    different ‘ringfenced’ legacy software that are not inter-operable. One of the
    main ways in which modern technology is reshaping water resources planning and
    management is through ‘disrupting’ the data value chain (Figure 4). This is manifested
    through new inexpensive sensors for in-situ monitoring (tending towards an expansive
    ‘internet of things’), increasingly powerful Earth observations from satellites
    and drones/unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to provide synoptic views of topography
    (including high-resolution digital elevation models to identify flood-prone areas
    and support hydrodynamic modeling), climate, water levels, flows, snow cover,
    inundated areas, landcover, watershed status, and even some aspects of water quality
    and groundwater. Earth observations [22], with near global consistent coverage,
    is rapidly becoming a game-changer for synoptic observations in large basins,
    where the resolution of even the free resources from NASA and ESA are often adequate
    for useful water resources analytics. New unmanned on-water and under-water vehicles
    show promise; they can be outfitted with sensors and autonomous (single or swarm)
    capability for surveying large water bodies (e.g., for bathymetry, hydraulic safety,
    water quality, or fish stock assessments). Figure 4. Modernizing the data value
    chain (Data→Information→Knowledge→Decision Support). New analytical tools, increasingly
    cloud-based—including at the global level, assimilate available data and generate
    estimates of a range of critical parameters related to snowmelt estimation, water
    balance, water accounting (e.g., WA+, WAPOR) [38,39], scenario analysis, and forecasts
    to create ‘digital twins’ of basins to facilitate analyses. These enable access
    to curated archives and real-time estimates of the water status for any basin
    anywhere in the world to support both strategic planning and tactical operations
    through data visualization, early alerts/warnings, and the development of interactive
    packaging for data, analytics, and knowledge. Examples include interactive portals,
    mobile phone applications, and dynamic e-books. These support decisions at all
    levels, from simple scoping of water resources development, to detailed planning
    with stakeholder involvement/outreach, as well as real-time operations. Additional
    systems related to data/text mining, social media integration, advanced cloud-based
    modeling, machine learning/AI, or ‘bots’ can help bring in an additional automation
    and integrated perspectives to support decision-making. These technologies are
    helping water managers reimagine the way information-based decisions can be made
    for smart water resources planning and management and are allowing development
    of integrated basin/aquifer plans based on both analytical and stakeholder approaches.
    Technologies have made possible new approaches to use and conserve water and administer
    usage caps (e.g., using satellite-derived actual evapotranspiration estimates),
    adopting a systems perspective to improve agricultural water productivity, benchmark
    systems, and incentivize sustainability. New in-situ and Earth observation monitoring
    and analytics allow for development and customization of tools for water planning,
    allocation, and coordinated water infrastructure operations in an integrated multi-sectoral
    systems perspective. Water infrastructure can now be operated in a more coordinated
    systems context for multiple objectives ranging from service delivery to climate
    resilience. Continuous innovation, piloting, and learning from global good practices
    enables quick scaling-up of new technologies and enables more adaptive management.
    3D printing, robotics, automated transport, advanced materials, nanotech, biotech,
    and cleantech are supporting new operational systems that represent a paradigm
    shifts away from traditional approaches. Examples include irrigation systems that
    improve water productivity and field-level water use efficiency (especially when
    combined with policies such as limits on water abstraction); 3D printed monitoring
    stations (e.g., 3D-PAWS [40]) that reduce costs for monitoring weather and water
    levels; and ultrasonic control systems (successfully piloted in Lake Quaroun in
    Lebanon) that can mitigate algae-related water quality problems. Platforms are
    emerging to enable people to work together in new ways in the sharing economy,
    including fintech, crowdsourcing, crowdfunding, block-chain enabled supply chains,
    asset sharing systems, Digital ID enabled e-governance, and open learning platforms.
    Many of these platforms have application in water management in large basins,
    including online/mobile platforms to support learning or interactions among remote
    or disperse water user associations, and platforms to help farmers access global
    marketplaces online, with feedbacks into irrigation water requirements. 2.3. Implications
    for Large Basins The implications of these new technologies, with a focus on digital
    technologies, for water resources planning and management in large basins, are
    summarized in Table 1. Major changes in water management around the world are
    likely in very short timeframes. Ref [41] Many of the initial impacts will come
    from the plummeting costs of sensors, mobile devices and connectivity, cloud services
    (including to process increasingly powerful earth observation and other big data),
    interoperability due to online data standards and protocols, and increasing digital
    literacy. Water data could be used primarily for water assessments, evaluations,
    operations, foresight, design, accountability, and education [42]. Many of these
    are useful at different scales—from monitoring progress towards the SDG-6 global
    indicators to helping design a culvert. Many countries are modernizing their water
    resources institutions and developing national water resource information systems
    and analytics to support basin planning and disaster management. Some are also
    strengthening ties among government, academic, civil society organizations (CSO),
    and private sector institutions to develop a broad stakeholder base for this transformation.
    Modern water information systems require integration of data (from global, regional,
    national, to local sources), data quality management, conversion to interoperable
    data services, and development of interactive dashboards to help access and visualize
    data services and associated analytics in appropriate formats to support decisions.
    Large basins will especially benefit from these changes given both the challenges
    (e.g., the need to integrate data across large areas; multiple stakeholders wishing
    to inform coordinated decisions; large water infrastructure investments) and the
    opportunities of large basins (e.g., application of free Earth observations in
    the 10–250 m resolution range; the ability to deliver reach large numbers of remote
    beneficiaries with valuable data services). Institutions such as the Mekong River
    Commission and the various Nile Basin Initiative centers have demonstrated the
    utility of modern data and analytics in basin planning and hydro-meteorological
    data integration. Other large basins (e.g., the Congo, Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna)
    are in the nascent stages of this journey given capacity constraints and transboundary
    cooperation challenges. Many countries are modernizing their water information
    systems taking advantage of new technologies. The United States and Australia
    are improving their already well-established systems facilitated by strong national
    institutions. Europe is increasingly building on its regional institutions (e.g.,
    European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, European Organisation for
    the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites, Joint Research Centre of the European
    Commission) to help countries access better data and analytics. China is utilizing
    evapotranspiration estimates derived from Earth observations to improve irrigation
    management [43,44] and India is enhancing its national water resources information
    system [45]. Estimates based on satellite products or global models are increasingly
    found to be comparable with those based on in-situ observations [46,47]. These
    techniques, especially when enhanced by a new generation of artificial intelligence
    (AI)/machine-learning (ML) algorithms and global models, can revolutionize water
    resources management even in data-poor environments. When accessed through customized
    interactive dashboards, this information can be especially useful for estimating
    parts of the water balance, estimating flooding areas, making customized weather/hydrologic/inundation
    forecasts, managing large water demands (e.g., agriculture) and system losses,
    while enhancing and benchmarking water productivity [48,49]. 3. Institutional
    Roles Traditionally, water resources institutions have faced the challenge of
    inefficient workflows, low capacity, poor coordination across sectors and governance
    levels, poor integration with other kinds of institutions (e.g., academia, private
    sector), limited transparency, and inadequate alacrity in learning from global
    good practices. New technologies are enabling improvements in information interoperability
    [63] and institutional infrastructure that can be developed at reasonable cost
    (e.g., ecosystems of computers, tablets, and smartphones and related Apps; shared
    audio/videoconferencing, shared communication, and touchscreen access resources;
    dynamic physical-computer modeling approaches [e.g., [69]). These can be co-located
    in clusters such as water centers that allow for co-location of representatives
    from related organizations that need to work together (e.g., the National Water
    Center in the United States) to develop and use shared products (e.g., the National
    Water Model [70]). These approaches could be adopted in many countries and transboundary
    basins where shared personnel and tools could ‘disrupt’ traditional ‘siloed’ approaches.
    New technologies are also fundamentally changing the notion of capacity-building,
    with services, automation, and interfaces reducing the need for laborious and
    time-consuming issues related to access restrictions, digitization, formats, fragmented
    desktop analysis, and dissemination on a case-by-case basis, all with only a few
    people having access to even view the data and products. New more automated systems
    enable wider access and a different kind of capacity development, avoiding the
    need for reinventing similar systems at great cost and with limited new functionality.
    These systems can increase levels of collaboration between agencies, through shared
    data, analytics, and visualization services. All stakeholders can leverage the
    learning and collaboration systems supported by the internet and high-speed connectivity,
    in order to learn rapidly from and contribute to global good practices. New technologies
    can help redesign stakeholder consultation, climate hazard insurance, payments
    for ecosystem services, by connecting stakeholders and by accessing new data analytics.
    Different institutions have different roles in this evolving world (Table 2).
    Table 2. Institutional roles in the disruption process. Water sector institutions
    have both management and governance roles [71] and both these roles can be enhanced
    through technology. For example, in the case of groundwater management in large
    areas, improved monitoring using in-situ sensors (e.g., for extraction, use, quality,
    recharge), Earth observations (e.g., for evapotranspiration estimates and gravity-based
    water equivalent changes) and improved models, could improve resource management
    through regulating groundwater pumping (volumes and timing) or determining bore
    spacings. Modern communication including for automated collection of fines, could
    improve governance to promote resource management goals of equity, efficiency,
    conservation, and sustainability. New technologies could be particularly useful
    in transboundary waters contexts, with multiple options now available for estimating
    resource extent and condition, and other key water resources variables. A key
    constraint in reaching the potential the various technologies is data availability.
    This could be overcome by wider government adoption of an open data approach.
    For example, the California Open and Transparent Water Data Act requires the state
    Department of Water Resources to create, operate, and maintain an open-access
    state-wide integrated water data platform [72]. 4. Benefits, Risks, and Barriers
    to Adoption The technologies discussed herein offer important technical and governance
    benefits compared to traditional approaches. They can increase robustness in decision
    making, as decisions are more likely to be based on more complete information
    (e.g., from weather and other apps, portals, decision support systems). They can
    increase the timeliness and accuracy of real-time and near real-time decisions
    through greater use of automation and rapid and reliable communications. They
    can reduce the costs of basin planning and management (e.g., lower traditional
    hydromet monitoring costs, reduced redundancy, and increased economies of scale
    from online services). They benefit end-users through better information and decision-support
    and enhanced mechanisms to connect stakeholders and global good practice (e.g.,
    through social media and packaged curated content). They provide enhance trust
    and cooperation across sectors and regions (including transboundary) and can support
    more democratic decision-making through open and equal access to data and information.
    While disruptive technologies (even while often benefitting from centralized platforms
    and standards) are encouraging a move away from top-down centralized decision
    processes, their adoption does not guarantee this positive shift. There are many
    instances of the deployment of disruptive technologies in top-down or centralized
    decision making without adequate stakeholder consultation. Understanding the governance
    context for disruptive technology deployment is therefore critical, as is explicit
    consideration of how this context determines whether new technologies enhance
    or hinder processes of stakeholder participation and empowerment [73,74]. In addition
    to these potential negative consequences, there are significant barriers to widespread
    and rapid uptake of these technologies. Adoption requires a considerable range
    of new technical skills, many of which are not standard in university water management
    curricula. In addition to awareness-building, there is a need to improve the sector
    skill-base through training, recruiting/insourcing appropriate cutting-edge technology
    skills, and building partnerships. As with any new technology, the need to invest
    in new infrastructure has budget implications, and while costs for many of the
    technologies are rapidly reducing, governments may be reluctant to invest in what
    may be perceived as non-standard equipment. As these technologies are evolving
    rapidly, there will be pressure to update and upgrade more frequently than in
    the past. With the accelerated risk of obsolescence, it will be important to move
    to new adaptable cloud-based approaches that allow rapid upgrading of systems.
    This highlights the need for changed mindsets to help water resource managers
    and decision makers step out of the ‘comfort zone’ to recognize this new world
    of rapidly evolving technologies. As well as barriers to adoption, there are some
    significant risks. Effective management of privacy and cybersecurity risks requires
    good institutional policies, frameworks, and systems [71]. There are implications
    for professional employment, since as with any technological change, large numbers
    of employees will increasingly find there is diminishing need for traditional,
    manual jobs as these become automated (e.g., gauge readers, analysts, desktop
    modelers, translators, etc.). Employers will need to recognize these trends and
    institute retraining or retrenchment/skill upgrading/replacement programs for
    effective workforce management. There is a risk that the digital divide will become
    greater—with many countries, and communities within countries, unable to access
    the disruptions that seem to be changing life for the better in other places and
    for other people. This will require increased emphasis on low-cost or free open
    public-domain systems and the ability to create and use more global platforms.
    5. Conclusions and Forward Look A new world of innovative technologies has the
    potential to ‘disrupt’ traditional approaches to water resources management in
    large basins. The widespread operationalization of the fuzzy concept of IWRM is
    now within reach, with new ways to strengthen the information, institution, and
    investment foundations of IWRM. Looking ahead, there are two mutually reinforcing
    aspects that will help make the rate of technological adoption exponential. First,
    technology is evolving at a blistering pace, dropping the costs for every process
    and enabling actions that were not even considered in the realm of possibility
    a few years ago. Second, the incremental adoption of some of these technological
    options in water resources planning and management are generating lessons that
    can inspire others to do even better as adoption spreads. These changes are likely
    to lead to a new way of reconsidering data and analytical sovereignty as data
    and analytics (e.g., for droughts, floods, basin scenario planning) become increasingly
    global, fueled by machine learning that builds on opening up of data access for
    training. Water withdrawal and net consumption will be closely tracked and monitored
    (with a combination of in-situ sensors and Earth observation) to improve systems
    management and benchmarking. Large-basin analytics could become virtually free
    for users with global, regional, and national development agencies absorbing the
    costs of development and any subscription services. Services for end users (e.g.,
    farmers) could also become free or low-cost services and help improve water management
    at the user level and deliver improved productivity. Collectively, these changes
    can help to ‘democratize’ water management through improved access to data and
    information, but increased attention will need to be given to equity in technology
    access. Disruptive technologies will require adjustments to how water professionals
    are trained, an increasing adaptiveness in water resources planning and operations,
    and careful consideration of privacy and cybersecurity issues. Especially as the
    world struggles with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic experience, there is an increasing
    appreciation of the use of such new technologies to help conceive, remotely monitor,
    and manage water resource systems and related investments. Strong leadership to
    create an enabling environment to improve awareness and skills related to new
    technologies to realize the promised benefits and effectively manage risks is
    essential to facilitate this modernized approach to planning and managing large
    basins. Author Contributions Conceptualization, N.R.H. and W.Y.; Methodology,

    PDF 1 Introduction Communication networks have become an essential part of our
    everyday lives and currently, our society is highly dependent on the proper functioning
    of communication networks. In connection with our private lives, the number of
    services that are being delivered over these networks is progressively increasing,
    and probably in the future, new services will appear, all converging over the
    same infrastructure [1]. Regarding professional aspects, communication networks
    play a key role in efficiently developing economical activities in a fast, secure,
    and reliable way. In addition, it is possible to find very powerful companies
    in the world having Internet services and applications as their main activity,
    such as Google or Facebook, and they are continuously expanding. In relation to
    critical applications, the question is whether the existing communication infrastructure
    can provide the necessary reliability, or whether new networks that allow the
    harsh requirements of such applications will be needed? 2 The Role of Telecommunication
    In the early days of telecommunication, communication between two entities was
    ensured through a physical communication channel between the two entities by so-called
    circuit switched networks [2]. This type of network ensures a guaranteed bandwidth
    between the entities, since once setup there are no interferences, and is kept
    available during the communication. However, setup time is required to ensure
    the connection is established. Besides the setup time, it should also be fairly
    easy to imagine the great limitations of these types of networks when considering
    millions and millions of connected end devices that need communication. The introduction
    of packet switched networks allowed the sharing of the limited physical medium
    among several communicating entities [2], and allowed for a much more flexible
    communication. The road from the first initial baby steps of a few machines connected
    over some copper wires done in the late 1960s as a response to the cold war, up
    to today’s full scale hyper complex networks of networks is a study worth in itself
    [3]. Today, end users have grown accustomed to have access to communication networks
    more or less everywhere and whenever needed, leaving them with a perception that
    the Internet is something that just is. This impression has not only been driven
    by the fact that wired communication offers very high speeds to the individual,
    but also mobile communication today offers a high data rate due to the technological
    development [4]. Now, the next step has come, that we want to use the existing
    communication infrastructure to mission critical applications. One thing is to
    say “my Internet works nicely at home, and at work it also works nice”, but another
    thing is to put so much trust into the network that we allow critical systems
    such as water, electricity management, or eHealth applications to run on top of
    these networks of networks. 2.1 Basic Communication Between Two Entities Critical
    infrastructures are to a large extent also distributed by nature. In such setting,
    communication is often required to be able to have elements in the system interact
    in a synchronized and organized matter. Subsystem A may need to react upon events
    that happen in subsystem B or vice versa. At the same time, critical infrastructures
    are often characterized by deadlines due to their connection to the physical world
    and the properties of the physical world which a critical infrastructure interacts
    with. Figure 1 shows the example of two communicating physical devices located
    at different geographical and network locations. These two entities could for
    example be a water management system that has to interact with remote control
    units located at strategic points along water pipes. Fig. 1 Communication between
    two entities [5] Full size image The data that is required to be passed from A
    to B and vice versa has to undergo a long way through several routers due to the
    packet switched approach we have today. At each passing point (router), the received
    data needs inspection to decide which router the packet should go to next. This
    may not always be the same for all packets even though their sources and destinations
    are the same as clever traffic load balance algorithms may be applied to avoid
    congestions among routers. A data packet route example is illustrated in Fig.
    1 as data going up and down in the different levels of the OSI model [2]. In some
    parts, packets need to be addressed at a network level, while in others only a
    link level is required. But it is clear that each hop takes some time for the
    routers to process packets. This leads to an end-to-end delay even though we experience
    the communication as a direct communication between A and B. The end-to-end delay
    depends on many factors, such as the quality of each link between routers, network
    traffic conditions (there may be bottlenecks between some routers), the route
    through which the data packets are being sent (this is not controlled by the application,
    but is impacted by the decisions made by the network). These factors also mean
    that the end-to-end delay usually shows a highly stochastic behaviour, rather
    than a desirable deterministic behaviour, and even changes over time, e.g., in
    some parts of the network there is more traffic during work hours than in night
    time or weekends. This complexity of intercommunication needed to transport data
    from A to B illustrates some key problems that critical applications have when
    dealing with communication over networks today. There is no or very little control
    of the data streams going between A and B. When routers receive a significant
    amount of traffic, they may start to drop incoming packets. Some transport protocols,
    as TCP aim at providing reliable transport by ensuring retransmission of missing
    packets, but at the cost of end-to-end delay because it first needs to detect
    missing packets, and then ask for retransmission. Others such as UDP offer to
    send data with crossed fingers that it appears at the receiving side. In that
    case, the application must be able to tolerate packet losses. Therefore, some
    of the key challenges that communication systems face, and even considering only
    two entities communicating, to support critical applications are not necessarily
    only classical data throughput, but definitely also latency and reliable communication.
    These key requirements are often assumed, because they are to a large extent hidden
    to the everyday user, but as communication developers we need to take these issues
    seriously if critical infrastructures shall be supported by (existing) communication
    technologies. 2.2 Communication over Heterogeneous Networks As a further complication,
    networks are heterogeneous and full of new and legacy systems. Figure 2 shows
    a conceptual example of how different devices and applications may be connected
    via a large set of networks of networks. The heterogeneity covers some challenges
    that may limit some use cases as the following example illustrates: Fig. 2 Simplified
    example of networks and connected applications Full size image In order to communicate
    between two entities an addressing scheme is required (a basic requirement for
    any type of communication). The most prominent addressing scheme today is IP addressing.
    In principle, all addresses should be uniquely defined, in order for packets to
    be sent to the right destination at all times. When the Internet Protocol version
    4 was designed and implemented, the space allocated for the address in the protocol
    allowed for ‘only’ approximately 4.29 billion unique devices. At the time of development,
    that was enough, but with the current development this amount has shown to be
    too small, since all sorts of sensors, mobile devices, multiple interface devices,
    etc., has ultimately led to an address starvation. This has not been acceptable,
    so several solutions have been invented to overcome this address starvation, such
    as Network Address Translation, use of private network addresses, tighter control
    of Internet registries, network renumbering of existing networks, etc. Even a
    new IP version 6 has been developed with a much larger address capacity, but still
    the earlier IP is being used, since so many devices depend on the stability of
    this protocol’s address space, that in fact no one knows exactly what happens
    if suddenly software started to use IPv6 [6]. The IP address issue is just one
    of many examples of the complexity of networks of networks shown in Fig. 2 and
    how networks even today are challenged by more or less invisible problems. Therefore,
    once again, one could ask the following question: do we trust these networks to
    serve as communication media for mission critical applications? Do we dare to
    let this patchwork of networks, software patches, numerous of standards, protocols
    and configurations be the bearing part of critical, life depending elements such
    as electricity, water and health in our everyday life? Referring to Fig. 2, the
    vision of several critical applications which interact with the network is shown:
    Doctors who have online meetings with patients, eHealth [7] Water detection and
    control, [8] Electric power control, smart grids [9]. On top of this, there will
    surely be other applications using the network, such as web browsing, video streams,
    emails, online games, etc. The question is, why should these critical applications
    use the same network? For example, cars and air planes have several dedicated
    internal communication networks so as not to mix the application traffic with
    real time critical data traffic. However, for simplification and cost reduction
    reasons, research is ongoing on how merge the different data traffic [10]. The
    time, effort and cost of deploying the Internet as it is today is immense. Deploying
    a separate network for each of the applications that is envisioned does not appear
    to be a very attractive solution if we somehow are able to ensure the existing
    infrastructure can support the requirements of the critical applications. A major
    key to the solution is the flexibility of the network as it is today. As a corner
    stone design idea of the early Internet (from ARPANET [3]), the idea of robustness
    to link failures has been eminent, which is a key feature for critical infrastructure
    as well as not having to deploy net networks from scratch. However the complexity
    and heterogenic nature of communication due to legacy systems requires interoperability
    and standards. In the following we take a closer look at how this is being addressed
    in the smart grid as an example. 2.3 Communication Standards for Smart Grids In
    smart grids, data from consumers and potentially also from the power grid infrastructure
    is required to be collected for control purposes. This not only means communication
    over heterogeneous networks, but also with a wide range of communicating entities,
    smart meters for example, produced by different vendors. Today, the core purpose
    of the meters already developed is to monitor power usage for e.g., electricity
    bills [11]. However, the data also have value for the utility company. In smart
    grid terminology, being able to remotely read the meter is called automatic meter
    reading (AMR) and is a part of the automatic metering infrastructure (AMI), i.e.,
    the network between the smart meter and the utility company [12]. With an AMI
    network the monitored data from a household can be sent to the utility company,
    which can use it to optimise their production of power and thereby avoiding over/underproduction.
    AMI has been addressed in various projects like Power Matching City [13] and others
    [14, 15] and it has been shown, that using the data from monitoring systems can
    lead to optimisation of the demand and response (DR) [16, 17]. However, it is
    not clear what are the requirements for the communication network. For example,
    the authors in [13] have made a living lab to demonstrate a smart grid. In the
    chosen setup, dedicated ADSL communication lines are used for AMI in order to
    avoid human interference. The purpose of this is to make sure that they have enough
    bandwidth for the communication. Nevertheless, the requirements for the networks
    are not mentioned. Implementing dedicated communication lines only for the smart
    grid communication is very expensive and not a feasible solution for all cases
    of AMI. Furthermore, the data can be used by the utility company to act as an
    energy consultant, to advice the customers how to save money based on their power
    usage data and additionally offer free or cheaper electricity during overproduction
    periods to encourage their customers to use power consuming devices, for example
    heat pumps, or allow the utility company to perform Direct Load Control (DLC)
    by controlling the customers devices and Distributed Energy Resources (DER) [18].
    Being able to control e.g., heat pumps, electric cars and other DER’s, makes it
    possible for the utility company to control and level the peak periods in the
    power grid by remotely turning on/off specific units in order to take off load
    or supply more power to the grid appropriately [16]. In Denmark, the Danish Ministry
    of Climate, Energy and Building has published a report in October (2011) about
    Smart Grid in Denmark [70]. In the report they encourage further research and
    development in smart grid and also mention communication as a vital part of the
    smart grid. 2.4 Standards for Smart Grids Mapping requirements for critical infrastructures
    is a challenging task, because the smart grid is a large complex infrastructure
    with different layers of networks, which gives a diversified communication performance
    expectation [18]. IEEE and IEC have already proposed a number of standards regarding
    the communication in smart grid in different layers. One of the most commonly
    used standard is IEC 61850, which focuses on the substation automated control
    and is used in the Danish smart grid project in Bornholm called ECOGRID [71] and
    for the AMI there is IEC 62056 [19, 20]. In the following some communication standards
    are mentioned which are proposed for different parts of the smart grid. IEC 61968-9
    and 61970: Defines the common information model for data exchange between devices
    and networks in the power distribution domain and the power transmission domain
    respectively. They are used in: Energy management system [21]. IEC 60870-6: Defines
    the data exchange model between the control center and power pools. It is used
    in: Inter-control center communication [21]. IEC 61850: Defines the communication
    between devices in transmission, distribution and substation automation system.
    It is used in: Substation automation [21]. IEEE P2030: Defines the inter-operability
    of energy devices and IT operation with electric power systems. It is used in:
    Customer side application [21]. IEEE 1646: Defines the communication delivery
    times to substation. It discusses the requirements of the system to deliver real-time
    support, message priority, data criticality and system interfaces. It is used
    in: Substation automation [21]. Challenges for the smart grid network: Other challenges
    in the communication network in smart grids, relates to delay, availability and
    security [12, 15, 18]. If the utility company is expected to control the distributed
    energy resources (DER), delay becomes a critical metric in the network performance.
    The delay in the network will have a high impact on the grid if the DERs are not
    activated or shutdown on time; thus, some sort of message priority scheme in the
    communication protocol will be required [18, 22]. Availability and reliability
    of the network are of importance to ensure the grid operation and also plays a
    vital role in the demand response [23, 24]. Security is crucial to the smart grid.
    When extracting information from the user, the privacy of the user has to be secured.
    The grid can also be vulnerable to terrorist attacks if the control messages to
    control various electric devices are hijacked [25]. Adding security can have an
    impact on the delay, as the messages have to be encrypted. Another way to add
    security is by not letting the hacker know where these control messages come from
    or go to. For this, an anonymous packet routing with minimum latency has been
    proposed [26]. There are a number of challenges in the communication network for
    smart grid. The standards proposed still have to be implemented and tested in
    many scenarios, in order to examine the network performance. There is still a
    need for research in protocols that can deliver messages safely according to the
    time constraints specified by the different standards. 3 Design of Critical Optical
    Transport Infrastructure Communication networks have become an essential part
    of our everyday lives and our society is highly dependent on the proper functioning
    of communication networks. In connection with our private lives, the number of
    services that are being delivered over the data networks is progressively increasing,
    and probably in the future new services will appear, all converging over the same
    infrastructure. Regarding professional aspects, networks play a key role in efficiently
    developing economical activities in a fast, secure, and reliable way. In addition,
    it is possible to find very powerful companies in the world having Internet services
    and applications as their main activity, such as Google or Facebook, and they
    are continuously expanding. Telecommunication systems have been evolving for the
    past 10 years, towards the unification of services and applications over the same
    infrastructure [27]. Currently, it is possible to identify how this initiative
    is partially followed by operators providing voice, data and video transmissions
    over the same access connection, known as Triple Play. However, the distribution
    networks of these services are not unified physically. For example, the TV and
    telephony infrastructures are traditionally separated. The unification of these
    infrastructures implies ambitious requirements to be supported by the network,
    for example due to the heterogeneity of the traffic flowing through, or the significant
    profit losses, or the number of affected users when loss of connectivity occurs
    [28]. Examples of recent cable cuts in optical networks are: In the beginning
    of 2008, the cable connecting Europe and Middle East suffered four single cuts,
    affecting millions of users [29]. In April 2009 AT&T suffered cable cuts, perhaps
    due to vandalism, in the area of San Jose and Santa Clara, California, leaving
    many of Silicon Valley businesses and customers without phone and data services
    [30]. In July 2011 35,000 broadband customers were affected for several hours
    by a cable cut caused by a truck in Washington State, USA [31]. Looking back it
    is possible to realize how fast the world of communications has evolved. For example,
    in 2009 the 40th anniversary of the first ever data transmission over ARPANET
    was celebrated. This fast evolution of communication technologies and services
    is causing a gradual increment of the bandwidth and reliability requirements to
    be fulfilled by the network infrastructure [32]. In addition, the traffic supported
    by the Internet has significantly grown over the last few years, shaping up the
    requirements that future networks need to handle. In order to be able to support
    all the traffic and quality of service demands, there is a need for high performance
    transport systems, and focusing on the specific field of this work, a highly reliable
    optical backbone infrastructure [33]. The interest is especially increasing regarding
    optical transport networks, where huge amounts of traffic are continuously traversing
    their links. Inefficiencies or disruptions on delivering the information become
    critical at this level, due to the number of simultaneously affected users. All
    these huge flows of information must be efficiently distributed using reliable
    high capacity transport networks. Bandwidth requirements clearly indicate that
    the optical network technology based on wavelength division multiplexing (WDM)
    will play a key role regarding this issue [34]. 4 Planning the Physical Infrastructure
    The deployment of optical networks is a long and expensive process, due to the
    trenching tasks involved, especially for large geographical areas such as national
    or continental territories. It can take 10–15 years to deploy such networks under
    the cost of millions of euros [35]. Moreover, the lifetime of the physical infrastructure
    is rather long, between 30–50 years [36, 37]. These features make such a network
    deployment a long term investment project, which should be carefully planned.
    In addition, when this high investment is combined with a reliable, preventive
    and green planning, a better outcome can be achieved [35]. Optical network systems
    are very complex; each of the network layers can have great impact on the overall
    performance, going from physical to application layers. In relation to backbone
    networks, the infrastructure can be limiting the global performance of a network
    just by the fact that the physical interconnection scheme has not been carefully
    planned [28]. In fact, when the network requires some kind of physical upgrade,
    the solution’s costs in economic terms might be much more significant, due to
    trenching and deployment tasks, than at higher layers where software updates might
    be enough to solve the problem [38]. Hence, networks should be planned and designed
    to provide high performance and high availability in transmissions. As the economic
    relevance of these networks is increasing, it is also feasible to increase the
    investment for their deployment. This capital increment opens up a whole new space
    of possibilities when designing the network’s interconnection. Planning is crucial
    and even small improvements may have high economic impact. However, no well documented
    methods exist for the whole interconnection planning process leaving room for
    the development of this work. The main overall challenge can be described as the
    physical interconnection decision problem of a set of nodes. This interconnection
    can be configured in many different ways, and several of these might be “optimal”,
    depending on the objective function and constraints of the optimization. In this
    case, two of the most relevant objective functions are: Deployment cost minimization
    and average connection availability maximization. The main problem is how to cover
    these two aspects in the same optimization process, as they are contradictory.
    Usually, the minimization of deployment costs would imply a negative effect on
    the availability of the designed networks. The number of deployed links to interconnect
    the nodes is compromised, in order to achieve the minimization goal. This can
    be avoided by conveniently selecting the proper constraints in the search process.
    The feasible solutions spectrum can be reduced to graphs that a priori will provide
    good solutions in terms of availability and not be extremely costly. Three-connected
    graphs are a good possibility to implement such transport networks. This type
    of graphs is discussed below, but first the models regarding deployment costs
    and availability should be introduced. Definition 1 A graph is k-connected when
    any \\( k - 1 \\) elements, nodes or links, can be removed from the network and
    still maintain a connected graph. 4.1 Deployment Cost There are three main contributing
    elements regarding the economic costs for deploying optical transport networks
    using WDM technology: trenching, nodes, and fiber spans. These are considered
    to define the following deployment cost model used in this work but new elements
    may be included at a later stage. Some of these concepts can be found in [39]
    and a complete review on the architecture of optical networks can be found in
    [34]. Let \\( I_{NT} = I_{links} + I_{nodes} \\) be the total cost of deploying
    a network. \\( I_{links} \\) is the cost of deploying the links and \\( I_{nodes}
    \\) is the cost of deploying the nodes. Each existing link is characterized by
    its length, \\( Lm_{ij} \\), and the traffic traversing it, \\( Ld_{ij} \\). Not
    all pairs \\( i - j \\) have an existing link. Basically, three cost parameters
    can be defined to calculate \\( I_{links} \\): \\( I_{trench} \\), \\( I_{fix}
    \\), and \\( I_{span} \\). \\( I_{trench} \\) corresponds to the price for the
    trenching tasks per km and its value can significantly vary, depending on the
    region or landscape. \\( I_{fix} \\) corresponds to the fiber terminating equipment,
    and \\( I_{span} \\) is the cost related to each fiber span where ducts, fiber
    and amplifier costs are included. The length of each span \\( L_{span} \\) can
    vary from 50 to 100 km [36]. Therefore, \\( CW \\) being the wavelength (\\( \\lambda
    \\)) capacity and \\( W \\) being the number of \\( \\lambda^{\\prime}s \\) per
    fiber, the number of fibers \\( nf_{ij} \\) for the link between nodes \\( i \\)
    and \\( j \\) is defined in Eq. (1). The number of amplifiers, \\( nla_{ij} \\)
    in a link is defined in Eq. (2). Consequently, the economic costs for deploying
    the links of a network \\( Top \\), \\( I_{links} \\), is formally defined in
    Eq. (3). $$ nf_{ij} = \\left\\lceil {\\frac{{Ld_{ij} }}{CW \\cdot W}} \\right\\rceil
    $$ (1) $$ nla_{ij} = \\left\\lfloor {\\frac{{Lm_{ij} }}{{L_{span} }}} \\right\\rfloor
    $$ (2) $$ I_{links} = \\sum\\limits_{{\\forall \\;i,j\\; \\in \\;S_{N} }} \\left(
    {I_{trench} \\cdot Lm_{ij} + 2 \\cdot nf_{ij} \\cdot I_{fix} + \\left( {\\left\\lfloor
    {\\frac{{TRF_{ij} }}{{L_{span} }}} \\right\\rfloor + 1} \\right) \\cdot I_{span}
    } \\right) $$ (3) Regarding the nodes, \\( I_{nodes} \\) can be divided in two
    parts; the facility cost, \\( I_{fal} \\), and the switching cost, \\( I_{swch}
    \\), related to each switch size. The switch size is given by the number of incoming
    and outgoing fibers to each node and the number of wavelengths per fiber. Usually
    standard switch sizes are given by \\( 2^{m} x2^{m} \\) for \\( 0 < m \\le 5 \\),
    and \\( I_{swch} \\) is not linearly proportional to \\( m \\) [40]. Concluding,
    \\( I_{nodes} \\) is formally defined as Eq. (4). $$ I_{nodes} = N \\cdot I_{fal}
    \\sum\\limits_{{\\forall \\;i\\; \\in \\,S_{N} }} I_{swch} (i) \\cdot W $$ (4)
    4.2 Availability Availability is a convenient parameter for measuring the efficiency
    of the network infrastructure regarding failure support. Availability is defined
    in [36] as follows: “Availability is the probability of the system being found
    in the operating state at some time t in the future, given that the system started
    in the operating state at time t = 0. Failures and down states occur, but maintenance
    or repair actions always return the system to an operating state”. Availability
    in optical networks has been widely studied. For example, [41] presents an interesting
    availability review of Wavelength-Division Multiplexing (WDM) network components
    and systems. In terms of connection availability analysis, [42] compares the availability
    results between simulation and analytical environments for a shared protection
    scenario. Also, in [43] an interesting approach is followed to evaluate the availability
    in optical transport networks. It is measured in expected traffic losses when
    failures occur. Availability is mathematically defined as the working time/total
    time ratio. Let \\( MTTF \\) be the Mean Time To Fail of any element or system
    and \\( MFT \\) be the Mean Failure Time. Availability \\( Av \\) is presented
    in Eq. (5), resulting in a numerical value of \\( 0 \\le Av \\le 1 \\). $$ Av
    = \\frac{MTTF}{MTTF + MFT} $$ (5) The availability in relation to an \\( s - d
    \\) pair connection is given by the availability calculation of sets of elements
    in series and in parallel. For each provided disjoint path to be available, all
    of its elements must be available. For a connection to be available, at least
    one path must be available. Let \\( Av_{pj(s,d)} \\) be the availability of each
    \\( j \\) of the provided \\( k \\) disjoint paths between \\( s \\) and \\( d
    \\). \\( m_{j} \\) is the number of elements of path \\( p_{j} (s,d) \\), each
    of these characterized by an availability \\( Av_{i} \\). Equation (6) presents
    the calculation of the availability for each path. The connection availability
    for an \\( s - d \\) pair, \\( Av_{C(s,d)} \\), is presented in Eq. (7). $$ Av_{pj(s,d)}
    = \\prod\\limits_{i = 1}^{{m_{j} }} Av_{i} $$ (6) $$ Av_{C(s,d)} = 1 - \\prod\\limits_{j
    = 1}^{k} (1 - Av_{pj} ) $$ (7) 4.3 The Graphs The decision of how to deploy optical
    links to interconnect network nodes is a complex problem. Its combinatorial nature
    makes it impractical to make the interconnection decision using exhaustive search
    methods. Heuristics may provide a good approximation to optimal results while
    Integer Linear Programming would be the ultimate approach. In relation to the
    distribution of the links, currently it is widely accepted that these ring interconnections
    are reliable enough for the demands of the users. However, if the current evolution
    of telecommunication demands keeps heading towards a more IT dependent society,
    higher degree physical networks (>2) can significantly contribute to the improvement
    of failure support, congestion control, or delay propagation aspects due to multipath
    options. For example, in the long term, it might be cheaper to build more reliable
    networks than less reliable networks that require higher maintenance investment
    to keep similar availability levels. Therefore, 3-connected graphs could be the
    natural evolution for this type of networks [44]. Consequently, networks formed
    by 3-connected graphs are capable of supporting two simultaneous failures, links
    or nodes, and still maintain connectivity between any pair of nodes. 4.4 Illustrative
    Example The main goal of this example is to identify the deployment cost versus
    availability consequences of using 3-regular, 2- and 3-connected graphs to interconnect
    several sets of nodes. The number of links in all options is the same but their
    different distribution of the links implies different performance characteristics.
    In order to obtain concrete numerical results, three scenarios are presented.
    These consist of sets of 16 nodes in Europe, US, and Asia to be interconnected.
    This experiment consists of designing the interconnection for these sets of nodes
    following these topologies: Single Ring, \\( SR \\); 3-regular 2-connected, \\(
    D3_{2C} \\); and 3-regular 3-connected, \\( D3_{3C} \\). The \\( SR \\) is the
    shortest 2-connected topology and it is used as a lower bound reference. Downtime
    and capacity allocation are determined considering two disjoint paths (1:1 protection)
    in the \\( SR \\) case. In the \\( D3_{2C} \\), three disjoint paths (1:1:1 protection)
    are provided between pairs of nodes, if possible; for the rest, two disjoint paths
    are used. In the \\( D3_{3C} \\) case, three disjoint paths are provided between
    each pair of nodes. The interconnections are optimized in terms of deployment
    costs, and the cost and availability models presented above are used. Details
    about this experiment, and Figs. 3 and 4 can be found in [45]. Fig. 3 Cost versus
    downtime Full size image Fig. 4 3-connected solutions. a Asia, b America, c Europe
    Full size image Figure 3 presents the comparison of deployment cost vs. downtime
    in the three scenarios. The pattern followed by the results in the three cases
    is similar, and it can be noticed how the improvement of moving from the \\( D3_{2C}
    \\) to the \\( D3_{3C} \\) is more significant than moving from the \\( SR \\)
    to the \\( D3_{2C} \\). The slope of the lines between points can be interpreted
    as the availability benefit of increasing the deployment costs, the steeper the
    better. Figure 4 illustrates the resulting \\( D3_{3C} \\) graphs for the three
    scenarios. In summary, to deploy \\( D3_{3C} \\) graphs is slightly more costly
    (between 2 and 11 % higher) than the \\( D3_{2C} \\) option, but the improvement
    on availability pays off the extra investment by reducing the yearly downtime
    between 230–400 times. 5 Reliable Access to Dynamic Information in Critical Infrastructures
    As a part of dependability, reliability of the system and information being accessed
    is critical. In many situations in critical systems, events are happening and
    require reporting to a server that will take action upon the event. In this matter,
    it is critical that the server reacts upon the situation as it is, and not how
    it was moments ago. In the following we consider the communication between two
    entities A and B, at different geographical and network locations, with A having
    a need to obtain information from B which happens to be dynamic, and this access
    needs to happen over a (complex) network with a stochastic end-to-end delay (see
    e.g., Fig. 1). In [46] we evaluated the impact on different access strategies
    to dynamic information elements over a network. The access scheme models are generic
    meaning that they do not model any particular protocol, but rather the behaviour
    of one. The delays involved are described statistically such that any stochastic
    models based on MAC, IP or Application layer can be incorporated. The models consist
    of the following three basic schemes: reactive access, proactive event driven
    and proactive periodic. Then, for the following we consider the stochastic processes
    An Event process \\( {\\mathcal{E}} \\), if Poisson with rate \\( \\lambda_{e}
    \\). \\( E = \\{ E_{i} ,i \\in {\\mathbb{Z}}\\} \\), where \\( i \\) the \\( i
    \\)th event number. An upstream (A–B) and downstream (B–A) delay \\( {\\mathcal{D}}
    \\), if Poisson with rate \\( \\nu \\), and indices \\( u \\) and \\( d \\) for
    upstream and downstream, respectively. \\( D = \\{ D_{j} ,\\,j \\in {\\mathbb{Z}}\\}
    \\), where \\( j \\) the \\( j \\)th delay. An Access Request process \\( {\\mathcal{R}}
    \\), if Poisson with rate \\( \\mu_{r} \\). \\( R = \\{ (R_{k} ,k \\in {\\mathbb{Z}})\\}
    \\), where \\( k \\) indicates the \\( k \\)th request. The definition of an event
    may not be unique, but by event we here mean a significant change in the value
    of some attribute or information element of interest. Significant can for example
    be if a signal exceeds some threshold or simply takes another enumerated value.
    5.1 Reactive Access The reactive access is characterized by A sending a request
    for information to B. Once B receives the request, it sends back the response
    to A containing the information and A will use this information for some purpose,
    for example as input for a smart grid control. Then we can calculate the probability
    of A using outdated and mismatching information as [46], $$ mmPr_{rea} = 1 - \\int
    \\overline{B}_{E} (t)F_{D} (dt) $$ (8) where \\( \\bar{B}_{E} (t) \\) is the CDF
    of the backwards recurrence time (see [46] for details) of the event process,
    and \\( F_{D} (t) \\) the CDF of the delay (with the bar indicating the reliability
    function, i.e. \\( \\bar{F}_{X} = 1 - F_{X} \\)). Here traffic is only generated
    whenever needed. The average waiting time is entirely defined by the sum of the
    upstream and downstream delay. The result obtained from B may also be cached at
    A, on which for some time period any requests are fetched from the local cache
    rather than sending requests to B. The mismatch probability model for that case
    is rather complex (see [47]) for details. Applying a cache means also that network
    traffic is in average reduced, as well as the average waiting time. 5.2 Proactive:
    Event Driven Update Another option is that B, which collects the data, sends an
    update to A if it detects an event has occurred. In this way, network traffic
    is only generated whenever events occur, however, if the event process is rather
    fast this can become a rather large amount of traffic. The mismatch probability
    for this approach can be calculated by considering two types of updates: (1) if
    each update contains full information, i.e., each update completely overwrites
    existing value at A, or (2) if each update only provides the incremental value
    since the previous update. For case (1), the mismatch probability becomes exactly
    the same as for the reactive strategy, but for (2), the mmPr can be modelled by
    considering the probability of finding a \\( G/G/\\infty \\) queue being busy,
    with queue elements modelling updates in transit. If just one is in transit, then
    there will be a mismatch (see [46] for further details). $$ {\\kern 1pt} {\\text{mmPr}}{\\kern
    1pt}_{pro,evn}^{(inc)} = {\\mathbb{P}}(E/D/\\infty \\quad queue\\quad is\\quad
    busy) $$ (9) 5.3 Proactive: Periodic Update This approach relies on B sending
    the current value or state of the information to A with a time period specified
    in one way or another. The traffic generated by this approach is entirely determined
    by the update rate. The mismatch probability for this approach is based on a thinned
    Poisson update process. This also means that the update process is stochastic,
    while it normally is deterministic. However, due to clock and scheduling drift
    in operating systems, and the fact that a deterministic update process (via simulation
    studies) shows to provide better reliability, this assumption serves as a worst
    case scenario. Thus, the model becomes $$ {\\kern 1pt} {\\text{mmPr}}{\\kern 1pt}_{pro,per}
    = \\int\\limits_{0}^{\\infty } \\exp \\left( { - \\int\\limits_{0}^{t} \\tau F_{D}
    (s)ds} \\right)A_{E} (dt), $$ (10) with \\( \\tau \\) the update rate, \\( F_{D}
    \\) the delay distribution and \\( A_{E} \\) the backward recurrence time, [46].
    5.4 Impact of Access Strategy on Reliability Figure 5 shows the mismatch probabilities
    for the different access strategies with varying event process rate, under the
    assumption that the involved processes are all exponentially distributed (for
    simplicity). The effect is clear for this situation: there is not only a significant
    impact, but also a very different impact on the different strategies, which makes
    it less clear which approach is actually the best. Fig. 5 Mismatch probability
    as a function of the event rate for different access strategies, for a symmetric
    delay of 500 ms and request rate of avg. 0.1 req/s Full size image Although it
    appears as if the pure reactive and event driven (using full update) appears to
    perform best, one also has to consider that the traffic generated is different
    (reactive in this case is 0.2 messages/s, event driven in the range of 0.1–10
    messages/s compared with the periodic one which is 1/3 message/s). Thus, in case
    of scalable systems such as smart grids where several thousands of customers provide
    data regularly, the solution of which strategy to take is not necessarily clear.
    5.5 Impact of Event and Delay Processes It is also not just the event rate that
    has an impact on the reliability. If there are restrictions to which values an
    information source can attain, e.g., a lamp is either on or off, and that is the
    information needed for e.g., a smart grid solution, then this additional information
    on restriction has an additional effect on the reliability. Figure 6 shows an
    example of a case where information can only be in one of two states (ON or OFF),
    with the ratio of time spent in one or the other state (\\( \\zeta = \\lambda
    /\\mu \\), with \\( \\lambda \\) and \\( \\mu \\) as the rates at which the information
    changes states in a two state Markov Chain). Fig. 6 Mismatch probability for an
    ON/OFF type of information model Full size image The figure shows that there is
    a maximum mismatch probability at the ratio of 1, i.e., when there is equal probability
    of finding the information in one of the two states. Any other ratio gives a lower
    mismatch probability due to the biased time spent in one or the other state. In
    comparison, the same process modelled as a Markov jump process instead, shows
    not only the obvious that the ratio does not have an impact, but that the resulting
    mismatch probability is higher than the two state model at any point. Another
    important aspect which is shown in Fig. 6 is that the delay process is important
    too (in fact the following observation is equally valid for the event process
    too—that is as long it is not a recurrent process). The figure shows three results
    of the same plot, coming from three different distribution types: (1) an exponential
    distribution, (2) an Erlang distribution with 20 phases, and (3) a Truncated Power
    Tail (TPT) with 20 phases, all with the same mean value. The results, which are
    consistent with other results shown in [46], show that the deterministic process
    (modelled by the Erlang distribution) is far the worst case, i.e., resulting in
    the highest mismatch probability. The best case is the highly stochastic type
    of information modelled by the TPT distribution. This is indeed good news for
    example for smart grid solutions, where the most stochastic elements are those
    which will need to be observed, while the deterministic elements are often those
    which will need or can be controlled, and thus do not need much other observation
    than perhaps a feedback whether the element has been activated or not. Take the
    example of a lamp, TV, or other similar device such as a household device which
    has a level of stochastic behaviour which may be modelled e.g., as an ON/OFF model
    as shown in Fig. 6. 5.6 Network Adaptive Access Strategies One example of how
    the models can be useful is the selection of the update rate of the periodic strategy.
    Figure 7 shows how an appropriate choice of update rate (\\( \\tau \\)) in the
    periodic scheme can lead to a consistent reliability, set here to 0.3. However,
    this comes at a cost of an increased network overhead which in theory can rise
    to an infinitely fast update rate (this is of course unrealistic). Fig. 7 Mismatch
    probability for an ON/OFF type of information model Full size image Similarly,
    an appropriate caching period can be selected to keep reliability (see [47]).
    Therefore, these models offer a large range of possibilities for reconfiguration
    of protocols which have the above mentioned type of interaction for dynamic information.
    However, as already discussed, networks are not static, and end-to-end delays
    are not necessarily similar over the days, weekdays or months. Therefore, these
    processes should be monitored and estimated, which is not trivial and requires
    software components, [67–69]. But, if done properly, algorithms via observations
    of information access request rates, data sizes of requests, and knowledge of
    the delays and event processes can be provided for proper selection and configuration
    of access to dynamic information for reliable operation. Then, the selection of
    metrics becomes a matter of how much traffic a system is allowed to create and
    how high requirements to the reliability of the information one has. A proposal
    for such an algorithm that utilizes the mentioned aspects has been described and
    evaluated in [48]. 5.7 Summary From this section we learned that the information
    access, the dynamics of the information, and the delay are closely related to
    reliability. Mismatch probability is a probabilistic notion on how certain dynamic
    information accessed remotely is, when being used for whichever purpose. The more
    likely it is that the information is correct, the more likely a correct system
    behaviour will occur. Unless dedicated networks are set up where data can be reliably
    scheduled, future critical infrastructure will have to face such challenges thus
    only probabilities for success can be given, and the cost of deploying networks
    is not to be underestimated as we will look into later in this chapter. 6 Security
    and Threats to Critical Infrastructure Networks are controlled by software, and
    as such they are vulnerable to flawed designs in protocols, implementation bugs,
    exploits and so forth, and every opened communication channel generates principally
    for a possible attack opportunity. In today’s world where for example terrorism
    is in focus, securing networks when used in critical infrastructures is more important
    than ever. Securing networks is a continuous battle against an invisible and sometimes
    unknown enemy, and in war, one of the most fundamental elements for a successful
    defense is to know and understand the enemy. Therefore, in this section we propose
    a framework for analyzing digital hacker threats to critical infrastructures [49,
    50]. As the digital aspect of society and our lives in general becomes ever more
    important, the defence hereof becomes an increasingly higher priority. Billions
    of dollars are spent each year to protect the systems that form the basis for
    our everyday lives against malicious attackers who would steal our data or sabotage
    our critical infrastructures. It is an uneven battle—attackers need to be successful
    only once, while the defenders must be successful every time. Therefore it is
    imperative that we know as much as possible about the potential attackers and
    their methods to be able to prioritize the defence efforts. If we know the potential
    attackers, we are able to predict, detect and manage possible attacks. To do this,
    it is necessary to make a threat assessment for the systems in question [51].
    Threats can be divided into three categories: natural disasters, accidents, and
    attacks. Traditionally, attackers are considered to be the same attackers who
    would attack the installation/system in the physical world (e.g., criminals and
    terrorists), with an added category of “hackers” [52, 53]. However, “hackers”
    is such a loose term that by grouping all attackers into this one category, it
    is very difficult to say anything specific about important threat properties.
    For an assessment of the hacker threat to critical infrastructures to be useful,
    it should have a greater granularity with respect to the attacker identification.
    By dividing the “hacker” category into a number of subcategories, for which we
    can determine specific threat properties, it is possible to give a much more precise
    picture of the threat. We divide the hackers into eight categories: Script kiddies
    Insiders Gray hats Hacktivists Cyber punks Petty thieves Professional criminals
    Nation states. The motivations behind each of the categories of hackers can be
    represented by a circumplex, as illustrated in Fig. 8. Each of these categories
    will be evaluated separately, whether or not they represent a sabotage threat
    against critical infrastructures. In this context, the sabotage is considered
    as reducing or removing the availability of the service provided by the critical
    infrastructure. In terms of cyberattacks, this can be achieved for instance, by
    a malicious use of controls, (Distributed) Denial of Service (DDOS) attacks, or
    worms [54]. These are the vectors that will be considered. The threat assessment
    is performed by comparing hacker motives (intent) and capabilities (competencies
    and available resources) [51], with the profile of the targeted critical infrastructure.
    This profile is described widely in the literature, e.g., in [55] and [56], and
    will be summarized in the following section. Obviously, the first step is to generally
    protect the infrastructure, by making sure that it is not vulnerable to common
    security threats. Therefore, in the rest of the section we will assume that appropriate
    action has been taken to ensure this, and we will focus on more advanced/severe
    kind of attacks. Fig. 8 Circumplex illustrating motivations behind each of the
    categories of hackers Full size image Intent: Critical infrastructure is a high-profile
    target that provides critical services to the area it is located in, indicating
    that attackers with Notoriety or Revenge motives would find critical infrastructure
    tempting targets. The return on investment on sabotaging critical infrastructure
    for money is very low because of the high security and the lack of monetary gain,
    so Financial motives are not likely to drive a hacker to this type of attack.
    And while Curiosity might cause an attacker to try and break into critical infrastructure,
    it is unlikely that it would spur the hacker to perform sabotage [57]. Triggers:
    Critical infrastructures, being high-profile targets, do not need any special
    triggers to be attacked. However, since critical infrastructures are often state-run
    and a necessity for a state to run, attackers with revenge motives could be triggered
    to attack at a perceived threat or insult from the government of the state in
    question. Capabilities—skills: Critical infrastructures should be and usually
    are assumed to be protected against common vulnerabilities; the systems are updated
    and protected by security solutions. Therefore it takes either a significant amount
    of very specialized skills to break the defences and/or considerable resources
    [58]. Capabilities—resources: For sabotage of critical infrastructures to be really
    effective, several facilities need to be hit for prolonged periods. This requires
    either huge amounts of resources to be able to hit several systems in parallel
    and sustain attacks, or very specialized skills and insider knowledge to create
    cascading effects between networked systems. Methods: While critical infrastructures
    are generally well protected, no system is completely secure. Critical infrastructures
    are vulnerable to all considered attack vectors (malicious use of controls, DDoS
    attacks, and worms) if the attackers utilize them with enough resources and/or
    skills. Trends: The increased focus on cyber security in the society in general
    also has a positive effect on the security awareness of critical infrastructures.
    One example is that industrial control systems are generally better protected
    after the Stuxnet incident made everyone aware that they are a potential target
    [59]. In the following we will use these threat properties to discuss to which
    extent the different hacker categories have the will and the capabilities to execute
    successful attacks specifically against critical infrastructures. 6.1 Script Kiddies
    Attackers of the Script kiddies category are novices with low hacking skills and
    limited understanding of technical consequences, who use tools or scripts downloaded
    from the internet. Intent: Primary motivations for Script kiddies are notoriety
    and curiosity, and as such critical infrastructure being a high-profile target
    would be attractive, but the tools used by Script kiddies often choose targets
    at random (for example, The Honeynet Project (2004)). Triggers: The only trigger
    Script kiddies need to attack is the opportunity. If they find a vulnerability
    in their random, automated search, they will exploit it. Capabilities—skills:
    Low technical competencies makes it highly improbable that a Script kiddie could
    execute a successful attack against a target with a minimum of up-to-date defences.
    This is expected to exclude critical infrastructures from their targets. Capabilities—resources:
    Having very little resources available and operating solo further decreases the
    probability of a successful attack. Threat assessment: Have the will but lack
    the capabilities. 6.2 Cyber Punks Members of the Cyber punks category are medium-skilled
    but mostly solitary hackers and virus writers. Intent: As primary motivations
    of Cyber punks are notoriety and curiosity, they might target critical infrastructures.
    Triggers: Cyber punks need no trigger to attack. Capabilities—skills: Cyber punks
    have some technical skills and understanding, and they will be able to use and
    even improve tools available on the Internet. A Cyber punk might write their own
    malware exploiting well-known vulnerabilities, but they are not likely to develop
    their own 0-days or perform very advanced attacks. However, some virus writers
    also fall under this category, and a novel virus might compromise one or more
    critical infrastructure systems [60]. It is not likely that systems could be compromised
    in such a manner as to cause cascading failures without being specifically designed
    to do so, but if a worm spreads aggressively enough to infect a large number of
    critical infrastructure systems, then it could cause widespread denial of service.
    Capabilities—resources: Cyber punks have limited resources since they are mostly
    solitary, or in small groups. They are likely to able to perpetrate simple, isolated
    attacks, although nothing sustained or large-scale. Threat assessment: Have the
    will and the capabilities. 6.3 Insiders Insiders are malicious but trusted people
    with privileged access and knowledge of the systems in question. Intent: Insiders
    are motivated by revenge and to some degree notoriety, and the former part makes
    them likely to try to conduct sabotage. Triggers: A malicious Insider mostly needs
    to be triggered to attack, however since the trigger can be any perceived insult
    or slight at the workplace, it can be very hard to determine whether or not a
    potential attacker has been triggered—especially considering that the potential
    attacker is typically a trusted employee. Capabilities—skills: An Insider can
    have extensive knowledge of the systems, including vulnerabilities, as well as
    privileged access to controls. An Insider might even have the skills to perpetrate
    an effective cascading attack. Capabilities—resources: While insiders very often
    work alone, they usually have the resources needed to make an effective attack,
    namely privileged access to controls, and physical access to the systems. Threat
    assessment: Have the will and the capabilities. 6.4 Petty Thieves Members of the
    Petty thieves category commit low-level fraud and theft, usually by using existing
    tools and scripts. Intent: Petty thieves are primarily motivated by financial
    gain, and as such, critical infrastructures do not constitute an attractive target
    to members of this category. Triggers: This group needs no other trigger than
    opportunity and a viable business case to attack. Capabilities—skills: Petty thieves
    use a standard portfolio of tools and techniques primarily focused around phishing,
    scamming, and credit card fraud. They are not likely to possess the skill set
    nor the tools needed to attack critical infrastructures. Capabilities—resources:
    Members of this group work alone or in small groups, and considering their focus
    on low-level crime, it is not likely they will have the resources needed to commit
    a successful attack. Threat assessment: Lack the will and the capabilities. 6.5
    Grey Hats Grey hats are often skilful hackers with limited criminal intent but
    a lack of respect for limitation on information flow and a large curiosity. Intent:
    This category of attackers is primarily motivated by curiosity, and they are very
    unlikely to perpetrate any form of sabotage. Triggers: Rumors of secret information
    or “impenetrable” defences might increase the risk of attack. Capabilities—skills:
    Grey hat hackers have very specialized technical skill sets and an extensive exchange
    of information, and as such it is likely they would be able to execute an attack
    successfully. Capabilities—resources: While there is a high degree of knowledge
    exchange in this group, most work alone and as such do not have the manpower to
    make widespread and persistent attacks. They do have the skills and equipment
    however, to gain insider access to the systems in question, which could enable
    them to execute a cascading attack. Threat assessment: Lack the will but have
    the capabilities. 6.6 Professional Criminals Professional criminals are organised
    groups of hackers with a strict business approach to attacks. Intent: Professional
    criminals are purely financially motivated. There is currently no business model
    that makes the reward of an infrastructure attack worth the risk, since most governments
    do no negotiate with terrorists, so they are unlikely to attack. Triggers: Like
    Petty thieves, the Professional criminals need no specific trigger apart from
    a viable business case. Capabilities—skills: Members of this group of attackers
    possess a wide variety of technical skills and knowledge, and they are willing
    to recruit or hire people with the necessary competencies to complete an operation.
    Capabilities—resources: This group has many resources in the form of money, equipment,
    and manpower—enough to perpetrate a successful attack against critical infrastructures.
    Threat assessment: Lack the will but have the capabilities. 6.7 Hacktivists Hacktivists
    are groups of ideologically motivated hackers with varying technical skills, but
    many and geographically distributed members. Intent: Since Hacktivists are motivated
    by ideological agendas and notoriety and known for a lack of regard for consequences,
    they are likely to target critical infrastructures. The US Department of Defense
    warns that it believes one of the biggest hacktivist groups, Anonymous, have both
    the will and the capability to perform such an attack [61]. However, Anonymous
    have publicly declared [62], that they are not interested in attacking the power
    grid because they realize the adverse effect it would have on the general population,
    and as such the intent in this regard is not completely clear. There are many
    groups, though, and not all of them have the same moral scruples as Anonymous
    claims to have. On the other hand, they do not alone have the necessary resources
    available. Triggers: Hacktivists are triggered by perceived threats or insults
    to their ideology. Capabilities—skills: While the levels of technical skills are
    diverse within the Hacktivist groupings, they usually have members with high technical
    competencies, although they might not have the highly specialized skills needed
    for a cascading attack. Capabilities—resources: Hacktivists have a large geographical
    spread and sometimes vast amounts of manpower. They may also have the attack resources
    in the form of botnets available to execute a widespread and sustained attack.
    However, only Anonymous is big enough at this point in time to conduct a sustained
    attack, and they have declared a lack of interest in doing so. This is subject
    to change though. Threat assessment: Have the will or the capabilities, but not
    both. 6.8 Nation States Nation states or representatives hereof have been known
    to perpetrate everything from industrial espionage over acts of terrorism to devastating
    nation-wide attacks in the cyber arena. Intent: In case of a conflict, any disruption
    of the enemy’s infrastructure is desirable, and as such, critical infrastructures
    represent an extremely attractive target to a hostile Nation state. Triggers:
    Nation states are almost exclusively triggered by disputes in the physical arena,
    most often geopolitical in nature. Capabilities—skills: Many nation states have
    substantial presence in cyberspace and commands many highly skilled experts in
    the critical infrastructure field. Capabilities—resources: They have vast resources
    in the form of money, manpower, specialized knowledge and intelligence, and equipment.
    They are very likely to be able to conduct a successful attack. Threat assessment:
    Have the will and the capabilities. 6.9 Threat Picture Three of the hacker categories—Insiders,
    Hacktivists, and Nation states, see Table 1—can be considered a substantial sabotage
    threat to critical infrastructures at present time, but this is subject to change.
    Currently, only these three categories have both the will and the capabilities
    to execute a successful attack on critical infrastructures. Table 1 Threat matrix
    indicating will and capabilities of attackers Full size table 6.10 Defence Priorities
    Working to defend critical infrastructure in a resource-constrained environment
    means that limited budget funds must be applied to achieve the best effect. While
    the thorough “basic” security is assumed in place, there are many areas in which
    security officers could focus their attention. Cyber punks methods: While most
    of the attacks performed by this category of attackers are limited in scope and
    sophistication, the Cyber punks do have one weapon that is a legitimate sabotage
    threat to critical infrastructures, namely viruses. A worm exploiting an unanticipated
    attack vector might plausibly infect several of critical infrastructure systems
    and causing widespread denial of service. Viruses such as Melissa (1999), ILOVEYOU
    (2000), Nimda (2001), Slammer (2003), and Conficker (2008) (most contributable
    to Cyber punks) show that it is certainly possible to reach a critical amount
    of infection in a very short while. To defend against such a worm may prove difficult;
    see Wiley, Brandon (circa 2002). An Intrusion Detection and Prevention System
    (IDPS) that uses statistical anomaly-based detection and/or stateful protocol
    analysis detection would have a good chance of catching such a threat, and there
    are different ways of hardening the network, depending on how fast the worm propagates
    [63, 64]. Insider methods: Attacks by Insiders will likely take the form of malicious
    use of controls. Based on the [65], 43 % of Insider attacks were executed while
    the attacker still had legitimate access to the systems. The majority of Insider
    attacks were, however, executed while the attacker should no longer have the access.
    The defence mechanisms that would help defend against such attacks should be based
    on the principle of least privilege in order to limit the amount of damage that
    can be done with malicious use of legitimate access. Also, having tight management
    of personnel access would limit the amount of damage previous employees could
    cause, since they would lose access as soon as they were no longer employed. More
    detailed advice on how to mitigate the threat of Insider attacks can be found
    in [66]. Nation state methods: The methods employed by Nation states vary, but
    there seems to be a prevalence towards spear-phishing and zero-day exploits combined
    with worms (e.g., Night Dragon and Stuxnet attacks) as well as devastating DDoS
    attacks (e.g., Georgia, 66, and 10 Days of Rain). Defence priorities include educating
    staff and increasing awareness to avoid anyone falling victim to spear-fishing
    or similar social engineering attacks. It is in the nature of things quite difficult
    to detect the use of zero-day exploits, but good intrusion detection systems might
    be able to pick up the change in network behaviour. DDoS prevention should also
    be a priority, and the volume of the attacks can be expected to be severe, so
    cooperation with for instance large ISPs might be an option to consider. 6.11
    Summary Based on the threat picture described in this section, defence efforts
    against digital sabotage of critical infrastructures should focus on dealing with
    malicious Insiders as well as Cyber punks, and hostile Nation states. This could
    be done by prioritizing access management, including implementing the principle
    of least privilege, as well as installing an Intrusion Detection and Prevention
    System, educating staff to be wary of spear-phishing and similar social engineering
    attacks, and protecting systems from DDoS attacks. Defence efforts should be particularly
    focused in times of geopolitical conflict, where the risk of a Nation state attack
    is high. Furthermore, an eye should be kept on the development in the Hacktivist
    category, since there is a risk that this group will develop into a threat in
    the near future. The analysis presented can also be used when designing and deploying
    new infrastructures such as Smart Grid, Intelligent Transportation Systems, and
    infrastructures supporting Tele-Health in larger scales. Knowing which groups
    are the most probable attackers, and knowing their capabilities in terms of skills
    and resources, can help identify which kinds of attacks are important to prepare
    for. There is a big difference between being attacked by Insiders, Nation states,
    or Script kiddies. For researchers in the domain of cyber security this knowledge
    can be used to indicate where further research and development is needed, e.g.,
    when developing technologies for intrusion detection systems for general or specific
    critical infrastructures. 7 Previous and Ongoing Research Activities The purpose
    of this section is not to provide an elaborate list of projects, but give a short
    overview of some of the activities that have been carried out, are running or
    will be running in the near future, at European level in the area of communication
    role in Critical infrastructures and related topics. For more details, the reader
    should visit the IST website: http://www.ist-world.org/ or http://www.cordis.europa.eu/ist/.
    7.1 Brief Overview of Selected Projects and Activities CRUTIAL This project, which
    ran from 2006–2008, has focused on key issues related to trust establishment,
    access control and fault diagnosis for critical infrastructures. Inspired by Intrusion
    tolerant system architecture, CRUTIAL is based on two facts; Critical Information
    Infrastructure features a lot of existing legacy systems, and two existing security
    solutions may jeopardize operational and functional requirements to critical infrastructure
    systems. Key components in their architecture are (1) configuration aspects, (2)
    middleware for automatic fault tolerance inclusive intrusion, (3) trustworthy
    monitoring mechanism, (4) security and access policy management and enforcement.
    MAFTIA was a project running between 2000–2003, focusing on fault and intrusion
    tolerance network support for critical infrastructure systems. The project aimed
    to develop an architecture based on hybrid failure assumptions, recursive use
    of fault prevention and fault tolerance techniques, and the notion of trusting
    components to the extent of their trustworthiness. MAFTIA distinguishes between
    attacks, vulnerabilities, and intrusions as three types of interrelated faults.
    Selected system components were implemented and validated through a set of text
    scenarios with success. HIDENETS The aim of HIDENETS, running from 2006 to 2008,
    was to develop and analyse end-to-end resilience solutions for distributed applications
    and mobility-aware services in ubiquitous communication scenarios. The idea has
    been to make use of off-the-shelf components and wireless communication links
    to dramatically decrease the costs of market entry and enable ubiquitous scenarios
    of ad hoc car-to-car communication with infrastructure service support commercially
    feasible. Dependability has been a keyword in this project, and many of the lessons
    learned here will be beneficial to critical infrastructure communication systems.
    GRIDCOMP GridComp main goal was to design and implement a component based framework
    suitable to support the development of efficient grid applications. Such frameworks
    are important since the automation and complexity of critical infrastructures
    makes it necessary to have a structural way of developing software components
    and middleware on top of networks. The key feature of the developed framework
    was its level of abstraction perceived by programmers by hierarchically composable
    components and advanced, interactive/integrated development environments. The
    framework was supposed to allow a faster and more effective grid application development
    process by considering advanced component (self-) management features. NESSI-GRID
    The objective of this project was to contribute to the activities of the Networked
    European Software and Service Initiative (NESSI) with special focus on next generation
    Grid technologies; Services not necessarily only for user interaction, but also
    for critical subsystems. The aspect regarding services in the communication infrastructure
    and inter operability is not trivial, and it was expected that output of this
    activity would be aligned with that of Service Oriented Knowledge Utilities (SOKU)
    as defined by the Next Generation Grid expert group. INTEGRIS A project which
    has run since 2010 and ended in 2012, addressing a novel and flexible ICT infrastructure
    based on a hybrid power line communication/wireless integrated communication system
    for smart electricity grids. The project covers monitoring, operation, customer
    integration, demand side management, voltage control, quality of service control
    and control of distributed energy resources. On the communication side, in particular
    interoperability of the power line communication, wireless sensor networks and
    radio frequency identification are in focus. REALSMART This project, running from
    2010 to 2014, aims to look at smart grid solutions. From a communication point
    of view, the solutions sought in this project relate to measurement collection
    procedures for phasor measurements to allow an improved observation of the transmission
    grid. Among other questions that need to be addressed, is the handling of the
    massive amounts of real time data that are to be collected. EDGE EDGE is a Danish
    funded project running from 2012 to 2017, which aims to develop complex control
    algorithms for smart grid systems based on power flexibility from consumers. The
    role of the communication in this project is in particular on the interaction
    between these advanced control algorithms and strategies and the network dynamics
    that exist in heterogenous networks. SmartC2Net This project is a new smart grid
    project starting in the last part of 2012 until 2015. This project aims to provide
    an ICT platform that supports flexible interaction possibilities between control
    algorithms and strategies, and the physical entities distributed in the power
    grid. This entails information reliability models, flexible reconfiguration of
    the network, control strategy based QoS control, network monitoring and security
    threat analysis. 7.2 Summary A common denominator of all these projects is the
    focus of ICT and its role in the various aspects of critical applications that
    run over the network. As investigated in this part, this is necessary as networks
    are complex, and far from perfect. In most cases, and in particular for large
    scaled, general purpose networks (e.g., the Internet) only probabilistic guarantees
    can be given, which may or may not be sufficient for the critical applications.
    Projects such as CRUTIAL, MAFTIA and HIDENETS focus to a large extent on the dependability
    of services in the network infrastructure, which all concerns both reliability
    and availability in a distributed setting elements. Availability and security
    is strongly linked. These are key elements when supporting critical infrastructures,
    and surely lessons learned here will in some way find the way in future networks.
    Projects such as GRIDCOMP and NESSI-GRID focus also on service interaction and
    interoperability as well as on how programmers can integrate software solutions.
    This is absolutely a key feature for reliable operation of networks, since as
    also seen in many of the other projects, middleware and software components in
    the network will play a key role in future critical networks. Finally, projects
    such as INTEGRIS, EDGE and SmartC2Net aim specifically to address the interaction
    between control algorithms for smart grids and the network. For the network, the
    running application behaviour is critical, as this sets the requirements to the
    network that provides the end-to-end communication. Therefore, understanding the
    interaction between application and network is critical, and is manifested to
    some degree in the need for such projects. These examples as well as the other
    non-European efforts, national projects and initiatives, provides valuable insight
    in the challenges and solutions of using the existing network for critical applications.
    At the end this benefits to save costs for redeployment of dedicated networks
    to each critical application that exists. This makes it necessary to explore and
    spend funding on research to achieve a reliable communication infrastructure.
    8 Conclusions and Outlook Communication networks are complex and pose a challenge
    to distributed systems, and although these networks offers great advantages of
    cheap exchange of information for various purposes, it is critical not to under
    estimate the role communication plays in distributed applications. In particular
    not for critical infrastructures which require communication due to their distributed
    nature. The complexity and dynamics of the networks are challenged at all levels.
    Through this chapter, we looked at basic communication, standards for smart grids,
    network deployment, reliability of protocols, security and threats, and also gave
    a brief overview of what type of research is or has been ongoing at a European
    level to address the issues that need to be tackled for networks to support critical
    infrastructures. References Future Internet 2020: Visions of an Industry Expert

  explanation: 'The paper discusses the potential ethical challenges of digital livestock
    farming (DLF), specifically focusing on how increased data collection and automation
    could lead to a loss of human expertise, a decrease in the human-animal bond,
    and potential objectification of animals.


    The authors identify several key areas of concern:


    1. **Animal Contentment**: DLF technologies have the potential to improve animal
    welfare by providing real-time data on health, behavior, and performance. However,
    if this data is not used in a responsible manner, it could lead to animals being
    treated as mere data points rather than sentient beings. To address this concern,
    the authors emphasize the importance of prioritizing the use of DLF technologies
    to promote animal well-being and ensuring that animals continue to receive proper
    care and attention from farmers.


    2. **Disruption and Critical Analysis**: The introduction of DLF technologies
    has the potential to disrupt traditional farming practices and displace workers.
    The authors recognize that this is a legitimate concern, but they argue that it
    is important to approach this disruption with a critical and forward-looking perspective.
    They emphasize the need for farmers to embrace new technologies and skills to
    stay competitive and adapt to the changing landscape of agriculture.


    3. **Digital Divide and Obsolescence**: The authors acknowledge that not all farmers
    have equal access to DLF technologies, which could exacerbate existing inequalities
    and create a digital divide. They call for efforts to ensure that all farmers
    have access to the necessary technologies and training to participate in the digital
    transformation of agriculture.


    4. **Social Considerations**: The authors discuss the potential social implications
    of DLF, such as the impact on employment, rural communities, and consumer perceptions.
    They emphasize the importance of considering the broader social and ethical implications
    of these technologies and engaging in ongoing dialogue with stakeholders to address
    any concerns.


    5. **Greenhouse Gas Emissions**: The authors recognize that DLF technologies have
    the potential to contribute to greenhouse gas emissions, particularly if they
    are used to increase production efficiency without addressing underlying environmental
    issues. They call for a holistic approach to sustainability in agriculture that
    considers both the environmental and social impacts of these technologies.


    6. **Artiﬁcial Intelligence and Public Policy**: The authors discuss the need
    for robust public policy frameworks to govern the use of artificial intelligence
    (AI) in DLF. They emphasize the importance of transparency, accountability, and
    ethical considerations in the development and deployment of AI systems in agriculture.


    7. **Human–Animal Relationships**: The authors acknowledge that DLF technologies
    could alter human–animal relationships by reducing the need for direct human interaction
    with animals. They emphasize the importance of maintaining a balance between technology
    and human care and ensuring that animals continue to receive the attention and
    affection they need to thrive.


    8. **Privacy and Data Protection**: The authors discuss the importance of protecting
    the privacy of farmers and animals and ensuring that data collected through DLF
    technologies is used responsibly. They emphasize the need for clear data protection
    regulations and ethical guidelines to safeguard sensitive information.


    9. **Bias and Discrimination**: The authors recognize that DLF algorithms could
    potentially be biased, leading to unfair or discriminatory practices. They emphasize
    the importance of ensuring that algorithms are developed and used in a fair and
    transparent manner to avoid unintended consequences.'
  extract_1: '"From your close reading of the paper, provide a concise explanation
    of the study''s purpose and main objectives, using a maximum of 3 sentences."'
  extract_2: The purpose of this opinion review is to "critically analyze the ethical
    challenges" of DLF, "identify existing and emerging ethical concerns," and "propose
    solutions and best practices based on the analysis of case studies and real-world
    implementations."

    \ sneethir@gmail.com\nAbstract: The emergence of precision and digital livestock\
    \ farming presents an opportunity for\nsustainable animal farming practices that\
    \ enhance animal welfare and health. However, this trans-\nformation of modern\
    \ animal farming through digital technology has several implications for the\n\
    technological, social, economic, and environmental aspects of farming. It is crucial\
    \ to analyze the\nethical considerations associated with the digitalization of\
    \ modern animal farming, particularly in the\ncontext of human–animal relationships\
    \ and potential objectiﬁcation. This analysis can help develop\nframeworks for\
    \ improving animal welfare and promoting sustainability in animal farming. One\
    \ of\nthe primary ethical concerns of digital livestock farming is the potential\
    \ for a digital divide between\nfarmers who have access to advanced technologies\
    \ and those who do not. This could lead to a\ndisparity in animal welfare and\
    \ health outcomes for different groups of animals. Additionally, the\nuse of artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence in digital livestock farming may lead to a loss of personal connection\n\
    between farmers and animals, which could impact the animal’s well-being. Another\
    \ ethical concern\nof digital livestock farming is the potential for the objectiﬁcation\
    \ of animals as mere data points. The\nuse of sensors and other monitoring technologies\
    \ can provide valuable data on animal health and\nbehavior, but it is important\
    \ to remember that animals are sentient beings with complex emotional\nand social\
    \ needs. The use of digital technologies should not lead to neglect of animal\
    \ welfare or a\nlack of human responsibility toward animals. Furthermore, social\
    \ context becomes essential while\nintegrating technologies in livestock farming\
    \ to overcome ethics. By considering the cultural and\nsocietal norms of different\
    \ communities, we can ensure that the use of digital technologies does not\nundermine\
    \ these values. To address these ethical challenges, the development of standards\
    \ and codes\nof conduct for the adoption and implementation of digital livestock\
    \ farming tools and platforms can\nhelp ensure that animal welfare and sustainability\
    \ are prioritized. This can help alleviate the privacy\nconcerns of stakeholders\
    \ and improve sustainability in animal farming practices. Additionally, the\n\
    use of virtual and augmented reality technologies can provide a way to enhance\
    \ human–animal\ninteractions and provide more personalized care to animals, further\
    \ promoting animal welfare.\nKeywords: precision livestock farming; digital livestock\
    \ farming; smart farming; societal impacts;\ndata ownership; open access; sustainability;\
    \ animal ethics; digital divide; digital agriculture\n1. Introduction\nThe increasing\
    \ demand for animal products has led to signiﬁcant changes in animal\nfarming\
    \ practices, with a shift toward more intensive and industrialized methods of\
    \ an-\nimal production. As a result, animal welfare and sustainability have become\
    \ important\nconcerns for consumers, policymakers, and stakeholders in the animal\
    \ agriculture indus-\ntry. This has led to the development of new technologies\
    \ and farming practices, such as\nprecision and digital livestock farming, which\
    \ offer potential beneﬁts for animal welfare\nand sustainability.\nTechnologies\
    \ can be considered a double-edged sword—something that is clearly\nexempliﬁed\
    \ in livestock farming. For instance, deepfake technologies have been drawing\n\
    attention lately. Such technologies are used mostly in malicious applications,\
    \ but they can\nalso be integrated with virtual reality to enhance animal welfare.\
    \ To illustrate, suppose\nthat a calf is suffering emotionally owing to the absence\
    \ of a mother that has been sent for\nAgriEngineering 2023, 5, 488–505. https://doi.org/10.3390/agriengineering5010032\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/agriengineering\nAgriEngineering 2023, 5\n489\nslaughter.\
    \ The technologies in question can be harnessed to create a digital simulation\
    \ of the\nmother cow that may provide comfort to the calf and enhance its emotional\
    \ well-being [1].\nIndeed, there are problems that are presently considered unsolvable\
    \ in the livestock\nfarming sector but that can, in fact, be solved or might become\
    \ solvable using digitization\napproaches, which make possible innovations such\
    \ as the following:\n•\nTransitioning from subjective judgments to objective methods\
    \ of measurement;\n•\nMoving from one-dimensional to multidimensional approaches\
    \ in solving problems\nfrom a holistic standpoint;\n•\nBecoming able to solve\
    \ problems by moving from a coarse-grained to a ﬁne-grained\nlevel of analysis\
    \ in order to understand, design and develop solutions;\n•\nMoving away from reactive\
    \ to predictive approaches.\nTwo such digitized approaches in livestock farming\
    \ are precision livestock farming and\ndigital livestock farming, the latter of\
    \ which has emerged from the former. Precision live-\nstock farming and digital\
    \ livestock farming are two examples of digitized approaches that\noffer beneﬁts\
    \ such as real-time monitoring, predictive analytics, and automated decision-\n\
    making. The integration of digital technologies into animal farming practices\
    \ raises several\nethical concerns, particularly with regard to human–animal relationships\
    \ and objectiﬁca-\ntion. There is a need to analyze the ethical considerations\
    \ associated with digital livestock\nfarming and develop frameworks for improving\
    \ animal welfare and sustainability.\nThe research question that inspired this\
    \ opinion review is, “What are the ethical\nconsiderations associated with digital\
    \ livestock farming, and how can they be addressed\nto improve animal welfare\
    \ and sustainability?” The review aims to provide a critical\nanalysis of the\
    \ ethical challenges of digital livestock farming technologies and their potential\n\
    impact on animal welfare and sustainability. It also offers recommendations for\
    \ ethical\nconsiderations, including the development of standards and codes of\
    \ conduct for the\nadoption and implementation of digital livestock farming tools\
    \ and platforms. The review is\nintended to inform policymakers, animal agriculture\
    \ industry stakeholders, and consumers\nabout the potential beneﬁts and ethical\
    \ challenges of digital livestock farming and to\nencourage discussion and action\
    \ to promote animal welfare and sustainability in animal\nfarming practices.\n\
    2. Precision Livestock Farming, Digital Livestock Farming and Smart\nLivestock\
    \ Farming\nTo begin, let us explore the core notions that shall occupy the stakeholders,\
    \ namely\nprecision livestock farming, digital livestock farming and, in addition\
    \ smart livestock farming.\nPrecision livestock farming (PLF) terminology has\
    \ been used for over 10 years. PLF\nmay be deﬁned as “the management of livestock\
    \ production using the principles and\ntechnology of process engineering” [2].\
    \ Its purpose is to “improve the efﬁciency of pro-\nduction while increasing animal\
    \ and human welfare, via applying advanced information\nand communication technologies\
    \ (ICT), targeted resource use and precise control of the\nproduction process”\
    \ [3].\nMore recently, PLF has been deﬁned as farm management based on continuous\
    \ au-\ntomatic real-time monitoring and control of production/reproduction, animal\
    \ health and\nwelfare, and the environmental impact of livestock production [4–6].\
    \ However, as we shall\nsee presently, this is a deﬁnition that reﬂects the ways\
    \ in which PLF has been moving\ntoward digital livestock farming since it emphasizes\
    \ real-time monitoring and control,\nsomething that has been characteristic of\
    \ the digital farming transformation. Accordingly,\nthe previous deﬁnition offered\
    \ above is more appropriate for our purposes of observing\nthe distinction between\
    \ precision livestock farming and digital livestock farming.\nDespite the recent\
    \ prevalence of PLF, we are now slowly moving from PLF to digital\nlivestock farming\
    \ (DLF) and, relatedly, smart farming (SF). DLF may be deﬁned as digital\nagriculture\
    \ or farming, applied speciﬁcally to livestock farming. Digital agriculture, in\
    \ turn,\nis deﬁned as follows [7]:\nAgriEngineering 2023, 5\n490\nWe deﬁne digital\
    \ agriculture as the use of elaborate and detailed digital information\nin guiding\
    \ decisions along the agri-food value chain. This includes the use of high-volume,\n\
    variable source data (“big data”) that creates critical insights, modeling, actionable\
    \ analytics\nand automation for precision livestock farming. Importantly, it is\
    \ not restricted to farm\nanimal production alone but also can span all or part\
    \ of the value chain; the transforma-\ntional aspect of digitization offers a\
    \ bridge between the consumer and animal caretaker or\nthe farmer.\nThere is a\
    \ marked difference in precision and accuracy with respect to each type of\nfarming.\
    \ PLF is mostly an incremental way of ﬁnding solutions, while DLF features a higher\n\
    degree of integration and encompasses sustainability [8] and predictive possibilities\
    \ that\naccount for time-scale phenomena [9]. The primary focus of PLF is on post-data\
    \ collected\nmeasurements for supporting decision-making and directing farming\
    \ practices. By contrast,\nDLF is about real-time and predictive capabilities,\
    \ which are made possible by self-learning\nartiﬁcial intelligence algorithms\
    \ [10]. Digitalization is about creating actionable intelligence\nvia data and\
    \ creating meaningful value for all of the stakeholders in livestock farming,\
    \ all\nwhile ensuring the well-being of animals.\nThus, DLF incorporates and integrates\
    \ precision and smart animal farming concepts.\nAdditionally, the emphasis of\
    \ DLF is not anymore on precision, which was already achieved\nat the stage of\
    \ PLF. Instead, now that precision has been achieved, the emphasis is on the\n\
    integration of precise data into digital systems. Thus, we see that DLF goes beyond\
    \ PLF.\nOne useful way of thinking about PLF is in terms of a multi-layered structure.\
    \ First,\nwe may speak in terms of input systems, such as wearable devices, sensors,\
    \ recording\nequipment, etc. These input devices generate data, which constitutes\
    \ the second layer. On\nthe third layer, we ﬁnd data management and storage. This\
    \ is followed by a further layer\nwhich includes processing, interpretation and,\
    \ ﬁnally, feedback.\nTo clarify, however, one should bear in mind that, in certain\
    \ speciﬁc cases, some\ndigital animal farming technologies can be considered more\
    \ as an incremental acquisition\nof understanding through observation. An example\
    \ of this would be mobile, on-farm\nreal-time detection tools that measure the\
    \ health of farm animals in the form of data for\ncommercial use and to address\
    \ animal caretaker concerns.\nThere are some useful points of contrast that can\
    \ be appealed to in order to elaborate\non the differences between PLF and DLF:\n\
    In a conventional system such as precision livestock farming (PLF), sensors (wearable\n\
    and minimally invasive or non-invasive) and video monitoring technologies collect\
    \ animal\nmeasurements and send this data to a computer [11]. Algorithms process\
    \ this data and\ncreate insights or enable farmers to make decisions. This data\
    \ can be compared to a target\nvalue or a model, for example, in monitoring temperature.\
    \ If the temperature is between\ntwo given values, it is within an acceptable\
    \ range, but if it falls outside that range, there\nis something amiss that may\
    \ require some decision-making. The underlying condition\nbehind the anomalous\
    \ temperature could be variations or ﬂuctuating hormonal levels\ninside an animal.\
    \ Here, the interaction between various physiological parameters has to be\nconsidered\
    \ and evaluated. Thus, conventional PLF basically collects data based on health-\n\
    or welfare-indicating parameters after the occurrence of an event. By contrast,\
    \ with digital\nanimal farming, we have the capability to move from reactive to\
    \ predictive measurements;\neven before disease onset, the data analysis can tell\
    \ when it will occur [10,12].\nIt is also important to point out that the transition\
    \ from PLF to DLF can be analyzed\nunder a two-stage approach. The initial stage\
    \ is characterized by an emphasis on digi-\ntalization. The second stage, in turn,\
    \ involves a more precise distinction between digital\nlivestock farming and smart\
    \ livestock farming (SLF), where both of these can be regarded as\nsuccessors\
    \ to PLF. Smart farming is a development that focuses on the usage of information\n\
    and communication technology (ICT) in the cyber-physical livestock farm management\n\
    cycle [13]. Now, many of the ethical and social implications of both farming systems\
    \ will be\nthe same. However, SLF also has speciﬁc implications of its own. Some\
    \ work needs to be\nAgriEngineering 2023, 5\n491\ndone to give more weight to\
    \ SLF compared to DLF in discussions of new trends in farming.\nAnother important\
    \ question to explore here is whether SLF complements DLF.\nDigital and/or precision\
    \ livestock farming is an emerging area of research, and the\ntechnologies are\
    \ currently being developed rapidly without much consideration of the\nimplications\
    \ of ethics in relation to the animals and the bonding with the animal caretakers\n\
    and other social elements. There is a need for understanding the elements of ethics\
    \ from\nthe social context and from the animals’ individual needs perspective.\n\
    3. The Ethics of DLF\nEthics is a crucial dimension of analysis to consider when\
    \ discussing DLF [14]. In\nthis regard, there are multiple issues to bear in mind,\
    \ which bring to the fore the ethical\ncomplexities created by DLF. Here, we discuss\
    \ several of those issues.\n3.1. Animal Contentment\nAnimal contentment is closely\
    \ associated with productivity. As one may say, “A\nhappy cow is a productive\
    \ cow” [15]. It is the fundamental responsibility of farmers and\nfarming industries\
    \ to ensure that animals live fully in their short life span (such as by\nexhibiting\
    \ natural behavior, demonstrating playfulness and enjoying a quality of life).\n\
    DLF incorporates this concern in the development of solutions since it can be\
    \ used to\npromote animal welfare [16]. Of course, sometimes society can be considered\
    \ venal, as the\nmain focus is on maximizing proﬁts and efﬁciency, not on animal\
    \ welfare. As researchers,\nhowever, we know that it is not sustainable to consider\
    \ proﬁt alone as a goal in livestock\nfarming, and DLF serves as a powerful tool\
    \ in this ethical pursuit. Here are some ways in\nwhich DLF can help achieve this\
    \ goal:\nPrecision management: DLF can provide real-time data on animal health,\
    \ behavior,\nand performance. This information can be used to identify potential\
    \ health problems or\nchanges in behavior that may indicate stress, pain, or discomfort.\
    \ With this information,\nfarmers can intervene early to prevent or treat health\
    \ issues, resulting in better animal\nwelfare and productivity.\nEnvironmental\
    \ monitoring: DLF can also provide real-time data on environmental\nconditions,\
    \ such as temperature, humidity, and air quality, which can affect animal health\n\
    and welfare. By monitoring these factors, farmers can make adjustments to improve\
    \ animal\ncomfort and reduce the risk of disease.\nEfﬁcient resource management:\
    \ DLF can help farmers manage resources more efﬁ-\nciently, including feed, water,\
    \ and energy. By optimizing the use of these resources, farmers\ncan reduce waste\
    \ and minimize environmental impact while also improving proﬁtability.\nTraceability\
    \ and transparency: DLF can provide a detailed record of each animal’s life\n\
    cycle, including its origin, breeding, feed, and medication history. This information\
    \ can be\nused to ensure the safety and quality of animal products and to provide\
    \ consumers with\ntransparency about where their food comes from and how it was\
    \ produced. In addition,\ntransparency in the use of DLF and the sharing of data\
    \ with consumers would increase\naccountability and drive positive change in the\
    \ industry.\nAnimal Welfare: To ensure animal welfare in DLF, it is important\
    \ to prioritize the use of\ndigital tools that facilitate real-time monitoring\
    \ and early detection of animal health issues.\nThis would allow for timely interventions\
    \ and treatment, minimizing animal suffering.\nDLF can certainly help farmers\
    \ optimize animal welfare, reduce environmental impact,\nand improve proﬁtability.\
    \ However, it is important to remember that DLF is a tool, and\nit should be used\
    \ in conjunction with other ethical and sustainable farming practices to\nachieve\
    \ the best possible outcomes for animals, the environment, and society as a whole.\n\
    3.2. Disruption and Critical Analysis\nDLF has the potential to be disruptive\
    \ in management [17]. Now, being disruptive does\nnot necessarily mean that technology\
    \ is negative. For example, by alleviating physiological\nuncertainty in animals\
    \ differently from how it was intended to be alleviated, predictive\nAgriEngineering\
    \ 2023, 5\n492\ndigital farming tools can be self-fulﬁlling and provide their\
    \ own raison d’être. Nonetheless,\nnormative questions and a constant reﬂection\
    \ on reality are necessary for developing\nsolutions via DLF. We should learn\
    \ from our mistakes, for example, even when poorly\nsupported predictions end\
    \ up being true. That is, we do not learn from mistakes if we\ncannot recognize\
    \ mistakes as such. Proper use of digital technology has to consider and\nlook\
    \ at ways to realize and take stock of our mistakes and learn from them.\nTo avoid\
    \ the self-fulﬁlling prophecies of predictive digital farming tools and the\n\
    misuse of technology, it is essential to subject all digital tools to rigorous\
    \ ethical scrutiny\nbefore they are deployed. This should involve a multidisciplinary\
    \ approach that includes\nexperts in animal welfare, ethics, and data privacy.\
    \ The use of ethical principles such\nas the precautionary principle and the principle\
    \ of non-maleﬁcence could help to guide\ndecision-making.\n3.3. Digital Divide\
    \ and Obsolescence\n“Digital divide” is another concept that we have to consider\
    \ in connection to ethics [18,19].\nNot everyone is capable of using DLF technologies.\
    \ The digital divide between educated\nand not technically savvy users will lead\
    \ to a technological rift. Animals’ inability to access\ndigital tools in farms\
    \ may lead to detrimental isolation from social interactions and may\naffect the\
    \ nature and quality of interactions between farm animals and caretakers. A related\n\
    issue is that of obsolescence. It has been estimated that engineering knowledge\
    \ becomes\nobsolete, on average, every 5.2 years [20]. Technology obsolescence\
    \ is also a prevalent issue.\nThis may deepen the technological divide between\
    \ those who are able to keep up with the\npace of technological change and those\
    \ who are not.\nTo address the digital divide in the livestock farming industry,\
    \ stakeholders should\nprioritize providing access to digital tools and training\
    \ for all farmers. This could involve\nthe development of user-friendly digital\
    \ tools and training programs that cater to individu-\nals with varying levels\
    \ of technical proﬁciency. To mitigate obsolescence, the development\nof digital\
    \ tools should be agile and adaptable, with regular updates and support provided\n\
    to users.\n3.4. Social Considerations\nA further crucial issue to consider is\
    \ the social dimension of DLF. Of particular note\nhere is the question of social\
    \ attachment. Some groups with a more individualistic approach\nmay see social\
    \ attachment as less beneﬁcial and perhaps even as a burden. Nonetheless, a\n\
    concern for well-being in relation to technology should take into account that\
    \ users and\nfarm animals are diverse and be inclusive [21]. How to ﬁght digital\
    \ discrimination in\ntechnological adoption and build inclusion should be considered\
    \ part of the development\nof digital tools for livestock farming. This can be\
    \ done by integrating values into the design\nof those tools. Indeed, technology\
    \ is not just an artifact, it is a tool, and it can also be\nan institution and\
    \ an intermediary. Design is part, as well, of social, political, and moral\n\
    values, which may lead to some fundamental challenges that involve resolving potential\n\
    ethical conﬂicts.\nTo ensure social inclusion in DLF, it is important to involve\
    \ all stakeholders in the\ndesign and deployment of digital tools. This would\
    \ enable the integration of diverse\nperspectives and values and could help to\
    \ mitigate digital discrimination. Additionally, the\nuse of participatory design\
    \ approaches could help to ensure that digital tools are developed\nwith the needs\
    \ and preferences of all users in mind.\n3.5. Greenhouse Gas Emissions\nDigital-tool\
    \ design and deployment in modern animal farming should also consider\nthe individual\
    \ carbon footprint associated with animals, processes and facilities, as well\
    \ as\nother greenhouse emissions like methane. Greenhouse emissions are of peak\
    \ importance in\nconsidering the environmental implications of farming. This is\
    \ a particularly clear example,\namong many others, of how digital farming requires\
    \ analyzing whether the digital tools\nAgriEngineering 2023, 5\n493\ndeployed\
    \ improve society in addition to enhancing food productivity. Doing so should\n\
    consider various platforms and applications of those tools and the context in\
    \ which they\nare being applied. DLF offers various ways of monitoring and perhaps\
    \ reducing emissions,\nboth methane [22,23]. To reduce greenhouse gas emissions\
    \ in DLF, stakeholders should\nprioritize the use of digital tools that help to\
    \ minimize the carbon footprint of livestock\nfarming. This could involve the\
    \ use of precision feeding systems that reduce feed waste\nand associated methane\
    \ emissions, as well as the use of renewable energy sources to power\ndigital\
    \ tools and other farm processes.\n3.6. Artiﬁcial Intelligence and Public Policy\n\
    The uptake of artiﬁcial intelligence-enabled digital tools for livestock farming\
    \ via\npublic–private partnerships and arrangements is becoming a main policy\
    \ tool. The pub-\nlic sector is not very approachable for citizens when considering\
    \ AI algorithms, which\ntherefore become black boxes, raising questions of transparency\
    \ [24]. Relating this issue to\nfreedom of information, we may note that proprietary\
    \ information is completely different\nand varies between the public and private\
    \ sectors. The public sector emphasizes trans-\nparency, legitimacy and shared\
    \ beneﬁt for all, while the private sector focuses on efﬁciency\nand proﬁtability.\n\
    With that being said, we should bear in mind that, as is often the case, “The\
    \ medium\nis the message”. Digital tools can be perceived in both a favorable\
    \ and less favorable light.\nIt is important to consider how to create avenues\
    \ so that digital tools shape our ideas about\nmodern animal farming in a responsible\
    \ manner.\nTo ensure transparency and ethical use of AI in DLF, it is essential\
    \ to involve all\nstakeholders in the development of public policy around the\
    \ use of AI in the industry.\nThis could involve the establishment of independent\
    \ bodies that oversee the use of AI in\nlivestock farming, ensuring that AI systems\
    \ are transparent, explainable, and accountable.\nAdditionally, public–private\
    \ partnerships should prioritize shared beneﬁts and the interests\nof all stakeholders,\
    \ including farmers, consumers, and animals.\n3.7. Human–Animal Relationships\n\
    The gap between the farm animal’s and the farmer’s intellect can possibly be bridged\n\
    using the magic of visualization platforms (Figure 1) via digital technologies.\
    \ Due to\nthe complexity of the vocalization of farm animals and the verbal depth\
    \ and breadth\ninvolved, visualization tools can offer avenues for better clarity\
    \ of understanding [25–27].\nThis can lead to a more humane form of farming, which\
    \ is of vital importance, given that\nalienation and dehumanization are some of\
    \ the chief current concerns around farming.\nAdditionally, healthy human–animal\
    \ relationships are central to farming productivity [28].\nThe integration of\
    \ digital technologies in livestock farming challenges traditional human–\nanimal\
    \ relationships by changing the way humans interact with animals. With real-time\n\
    monitoring, automated decision-making, and predictive analytics, the role of the\
    \ farmer\nshifts from that of a caretaker to that of a supervisor, with less direct\
    \ involvement in animal\ncare. This raises questions about the value of human–animal\
    \ relationships and whether the\nuse of digital technologies leads to the objectiﬁcation\
    \ of animals.\nMoreover, digital technologies can lead to the reduction of human–animal\
    \ interac-\ntion, which can impact animal welfare negatively. For instance, if\
    \ animals are housed in\nautomated facilities, they may not receive the necessary\
    \ physical contact and socialization\nrequired for their well-being, leading to\
    \ decreased welfare. Therefore, it is important to en-\nsure that the use of digital\
    \ technologies does not compromise human–animal relationships\nand that animals\
    \ continue to receive proper care and socialization.\n3.8. Privacy and Data Protection\n\
    The integration of digital technologies in livestock farming requires the collection,\n\
    storage, and analysis of large amounts of data. This data includes sensitive information\
    \ such\nas animal health, behavior, and genetics, which could be used to infer\
    \ private information\nAgriEngineering 2023, 5\n494\nabout the farmers and the\
    \ farm’s business operations. Moreover, if this data falls into the\nwrong hands,\
    \ it could lead to issues such as cyber-attacks, fraud, or theft, compromising\n\
    the privacy and safety of farmers and animals.\nAgriEngineering 2023, 5, FOR PEER\
    \ REVIEW  \n7 \n \n \nMoreover, digital technologies can lead to the reduction\
    \ of human–animal interac-\ntion, which can impact animal welfare negatively.\
    \ For instance, if animals are housed in \nautomated facilities, they may not\
    \ receive the necessary physical contact and socialization \nrequired for their\
    \ well-being, leading to decreased welfare. Therefore, it is important to \nensure\
    \ that the use of digital technologies does not compromise human–animal relation-\n\
    ships and that animals continue to receive proper care and socialization. \n \n\
    Figure 1. Implications of digital livestock farming for the animals. \n3.8. Privacy\
    \ and Data Protection \nThe integration of digital technologies in livestock farming\
    \ requires the collection, \nstorage, and analysis of large amounts of data. This\
    \ data includes sensitive information \nsuch as animal health, behavior, and genetics,\
    \ which could be used to infer private infor-\nmation about the farmers and the\
    \ farm’s business operations. Moreover, if this data falls \ninto the wrong hands,\
    \ it could lead to issues such as cyber-attacks, fraud, or theft, com-\npromising\
    \ the privacy and safety of farmers and animals. \nTherefore, it is essential\
    \ to have adequate data protection and security measures in \nplace to ensure\
    \ that data is not misused or exploited. This includes secure storage, data \n\
    anonymization, and secure data transfer protocols. Farmers must be transparent\
    \ about \ndata collection and usage and obtain informed consent from stakeholders\
    \ before collect-\ning data. \n \n \nFigure 1. Implications of digital livestock\
    \ farming for the animals.\nTherefore, it is essential to have adequate data protection\
    \ and security measures in\nplace to ensure that data is not misused or exploited.\
    \ This includes secure storage, data\nanonymization, and secure data transfer\
    \ protocols. Farmers must be transparent about data\ncollection and usage and\
    \ obtain informed consent from stakeholders before collecting data.\n3.9. Bias\
    \ and Discrimination\nDigital technologies in livestock farming rely on algorithms\
    \ to analyze data and make\ndecisions. However, these algorithms may have inherent\
    \ biases, leading to discrimination\nand unfair treatment of animals. For instance,\
    \ algorithms may not consider the diversity\nof animal breeds or account for individual\
    \ differences in behavior, leading to inaccurate\npredictions or decisions.\n\
    Therefore, it is essential to ensure that algorithms used in digital livestock\
    \ farming are\nfair, transparent, and unbiased. This includes regular testing,\
    \ validation, and audit of the\nalgorithms to prevent unintended discrimination\
    \ or biases. The development of ethical\nstandards and guidelines for algorithm\
    \ development and use is also essential to prevent\npotential discrimination and\
    \ ensure fairness.\n3.10. Environmental Impact\nDigital livestock farming has\
    \ the potential to improve environmental sustainability\nby reducing waste, optimizing\
    \ resource use, and minimizing the environmental impact of\nlivestock production.\
    \ However, the use of digital technologies in animal farming can also\nlead to\
    \ increased energy consumption, e-waste, and carbon emissions from the production,\n\
    maintenance, and disposal of digital devices and infrastructure.\nTherefore, it\
    \ is crucial to consider the environmental impact of digital livestock farm-\n\
    ing and adopt sustainable practices to mitigate its negative effects. This includes\
    \ using\nAgriEngineering 2023, 5\n495\nrenewable energy sources, recycling and\
    \ disposing of electronic waste appropriately, and\nreducing unnecessary energy\
    \ consumption.\n3.11. Creating New Values\nCurrent values do not sufﬁce to solve\
    \ the ethical conundrums of DLF, which calls for\nthe creation of new values.\
    \ For example, consider the issue of how digital tools bring about\nvalue changes.\
    \ Farmers can conceptualize digital tools differently based on the context\nin\
    \ which they are applied. They may see them as tools that extend their agency\
    \ or as an\nimposition [29]. It is important, therefore, to engage in careful\
    \ deliberations to interpret\nthe signiﬁcance of technology adoption among farmers\
    \ as it unfolds. This may lead to the\ncreation of new values and perspectives\
    \ that provide solutions to current problems.\nEthical issues surrounding DLF\
    \ require a multidisciplinary approach that integrates\ndiverse perspectives and\
    \ values. By involving all stakeholders in the development and\ndeployment of\
    \ digital tools, we can ensure that DLF promotes animal welfare, reduces\nenvironmental\
    \ impact, and meets the needs of all users.\n3.12. The Prospect of Monopolies\n\
    Another possible concern is that a single multinational company may take control\n\
    of the digital technology market for agriculture, creating a monopoly—something\
    \ that\nwould harm the freedom of small-scale farmers [30]. This could be a real\
    \ danger because\na monopoly would have the power to determine all sorts of crucial\
    \ factors, such as the\ninner workings of programs, digital environments and algorithms,\
    \ assumptions, modeling\ntechniques, etc., thereby compromising objectivity. Furthermore,\
    \ there needs to be account-\nability with respect to algorithms and modeling,\
    \ something that monopolies threaten. For\nexample, a model may prioritize the\
    \ achievement of certain breeding goals at the expense\nof animal well-being.\
    \ This calls for a proper balancing of values that requires inclusive\nsolutions\
    \ and scrutiny.\nThe issue described here becomes more pressing, considering how\
    \ a priority for\nfarmers clearly is to have access to economical systems that\
    \ integrate many different\nparameters and assumptions into their models. This\
    \ is due to the fact that margins are\nvery low in the farming sector. Hence,\
    \ livestock farming scientists have a responsibility\nto balance a wide range\
    \ of variables that go into modeling, a process requiring oversight\nand openness.\n\
    3.13. A Civic Approach\nWhen technologies are being developed for livestock farming,\
    \ a true civic approach to\nscience is needed that allows us to incorporate viewpoints\
    \ from the public at large, farmers\nand ethicists [19]. We cannot predict the\
    \ future; rather, we are making it, so we must all\npartake in it as members of\
    \ civil society. Of course, we hope that whatever emerges from\nnew technologies\
    \ such as DLF will be positive, but the results cannot be fully predicted\nat\
    \ the beginning of the whole enterprise. If ethicists are involved in the very\
    \ beginning\nof such new research, they could provide some valuable foresight\
    \ on the consequences\nof technological development. This is the case even when\
    \ technologies are developed\nwith good intentions since, to emphasize, the issue\
    \ is that of unexpected consequences.\nAccordingly, at the earliest stage, during\
    \ the technology’s development, ethics have to be\nconsidered and integrated into\
    \ the design and planning processes.\n3.14. Social Issues\nIn relation to issues\
    \ pertaining to the social dimension of DLF, we should mention\nhow digital animal\
    \ farming tools can be adopted and how their development proceeds,\ndepending\
    \ on how we think about them. A broader social perspective of technological\n\
    development is essential (Table 1). One example is the DeLaval brushes and other\
    \ comfort\ntechnologies available in dairy farms. There is evidence suggesting\
    \ that such technologies\nenhance cow productivity [31]. However, we may go beyond\
    \ that issue and focus on\nAgriEngineering 2023, 5\n496\nthe social signiﬁcance\

    \ are\npartly determined by genes that can be selected.\nA related issue is that\
    \ of heat stress. Pigs may often die during transportation from\ncommercial farmers\
    \ to slaughterhouses due to heat stress [33]. One possible way to stop\nthis may\
    \ be to use biomarkers in order to constantly monitor pigs and take preventative\
    \ or\npalliative measures, if necessary, to reduce the incidence of dead-on-arrival\
    \ cases. Another\npossibility is to use the data from biomarkers to breed more\
    \ heat-resistant pigs. This is of\nparticular importance given how global warming\
    \ is expected to affect livestock well-being,\nwhich calls for a search for ways\
    \ to adapt [34].\nSimilarly, digital biomarkers may provide a solution in the\
    \ realm of antibiotic-related\nchallenges. Often, farmers are unable to identify\
    \ diseases in livestock before they arise\ndue to limited capacities for phenotype\
    \ observation and analysis. This means that farmers\nare often forced to apply\
    \ antibiotics to livestock, which may have a negative effect on\nsales since consumers\
    \ may be reluctant to consume meat from animals that have received\nAgriEngineering\
    \ 2023, 5\n497\nantibiotics. One solution to this would be to use biomarkers in\
    \ order to identify diseases\npreventively and avoid the need to apply antibiotics\
    \ as a curative measure.\nA further example that highlights the potential uses\
    \ of digital biomarkers concerns\nso-called “exploding chickens” or broiler chickens—that\
    \ is, chickens that are raised to reach\ntheir maximum weight as early as possible\
    \ for commercial purposes. Broiler chickens raise\nsigniﬁcant concerns about animal\
    \ welfare. One common issue that affects the well-being of\nthose chickens is\
    \ respiratory problems. Biomarking can help identify such issues in order\nto\
    \ potentially address them since certain respiratory diseases are correlated with\
    \ detectable\nabnormal sounds in broiler chickens [35].\nRelatedly, the use of\
    \ biomarkers for selective breeding can lead to potential conﬂicts\nbetween the\
    \ constant drive to push the boundaries of biological limits and ethical qualms.\n\
    One may see this in the case of broiler chickens. Apart from the problems arising\
    \ from\ntheir living conditions and the physiological consequences of forcing\
    \ chickens to grow so\nquickly, we may identify a certain unease that arises from\
    \ the idea of engineering life in\norder to attain the limits of what is possible\
    \ in terms of productivity. This may lead to\nconcerns that life is being excessively\
    \ commoditized and reduced to a mere asset whose\nproductivity must be maximized\
    \ without any regard for what is natural or for the integrity\nof farm animals.\n\
    Inevitably, this leads to a conundrum that can only be solved through a delicate\n\
    balancing act. Livestock productivity is of paramount importance in order to secure\n\
    consumer demands, guarantee proﬁtability and guarantee global food security [36].\
    \ It is\nno longer possible to raise animals according to traditional methods\
    \ that used to require\nanimals to grow for extensive periods of time before being\
    \ ready for consumption. The\ndemands of productivity must, therefore, be reconciled\
    \ with animal welfare concerns about\nthe implications of the “race to the limit”\
    \ in extracting economic value from livestock. One\npossible solution may be to\
    \ develop a framework that will allow us to determine how\nmuch is too much optimization,\
    \ making sure to leave some room for farm animals to enjoy\nsome minimal levels\
    \ of quality of life and something approaching, to the extent possible, a\ncompletely\
    \ natural life cycle.\n3.16. Ethical Approaches\nThe ethical dimension of DLF\
    \ can be explored by looking at four strategies (Figure 2)\nin understanding the\
    \ impact of DLF and the way that it accounts for animal well-being.\nStrategy\
    \ 1: Sorry. If the animal becomes ill, we cannot help it, and we cannot cure it.\n\
    The only option is for it to be culled. An example is diagnosing a seriously ill\
    \ animal, such\nas a pig, as being antibiotic resistant. Most of the time, the\
    \ animal, or the particular group\nof pigs that it belongs to, is culled, as it\
    \ would not be economical for the farmer to treat\nthem and also to avoid the\
    \ possibility of contagion by other animal units within the farm.\n“Sorry” may\
    \ be considered the least ethical strategy, as it involves the culling of animals\n\
    that are deemed too costly to treat or too contagious to keep alive. While culling\
    \ may be\nnecessary in some cases, it is important to ensure that it is done in\
    \ a humane and respectful\nmanner and that alternatives to culling are explored\
    \ where possible.\nThis solution involves culling animals that cannot be helped\
    \ or cured when they\nbecome ill. While this approach may be necessary in some\
    \ cases, it can raise ethical concerns\nif animals are being culled unnecessarily\
    \ or if the reasons for culling are based purely on\neconomic considerations rather\
    \ than animal welfare. One way to address this issue is\nto improve disease prevention\
    \ measures through the use of digital tools and monitoring\nsystems, such as real-time\
    \ monitoring of animal health and behavior. By identifying and\naddressing potential\
    \ health issues early on, farmers can reduce the need for culling and\nimprove\
    \ overall animal welfare.\nAgriEngineering 2023, 5\n498\n \nbehaviors and needs\
    \ are being respected. \nThe key to addressing ethical problems in digital livestock\
    \ farming is to balance the \nneed for productivity and profitability with the\
    \ need to ensure that animals are being \ntreated humanely and that their welfare\
    \ is being prioritized. By using a combination of \nthese four solutions, and\
    \ carefully considering the potential risks and benefits of each ap-\nproach,\
    \ it is possible to develop more ethical and sustainable practices in digital\
    \ livestock \nfarming. \n \nFigure 2. Roadmap to the digital transformation of\
    \ modern livestock farming while integrating so-\ncial and ethical awareness.\
    \ Four strategies for the exploration of the ethical dimensions of digital \n\
    livestock farming. \n4. Technological Change and Innovation \nAspects of DLF having\
    \ to do with technological change and innovation shall be dis-\ncussed. There\
    \ are currently some interesting novel tools and developments happening \nworldwide\
    \ under the DLF umbrella. However, we are at the tip of the iceberg, or at best,\
    \ \nwe have just started scratching the surface. DLF will be here for at least\
    \ a couple of dec-\nades, with many significant developments still lying ahead\
    \ of us. \n4.1. Market Growth \nGenerally speaking, based on market research analysis,\
    \ we can say that the precision \nagriculture market is projected to reach US$52.3\
    \ billion by 2030 at an annual growth rate \nof 10.67% [37]. This is a large number,\
    \ but it includes both the crop and livestock farming \nsectors. Focusing on livestock,\
    \ veterinary animals and farm animals alone, growth would \nbe around US$19.37\
    \ billion by 2030 [38]. The whole DLF market can be categorized into \nmultiple\
    \ \nsegments \n(animal \nmonitoring \ntechnologies, \nanimal \nbiotechnologies,\
    \ \nFigure 2. Roadmap to the digital transformation of modern livestock farming\
    \ while integrating\nsocial and ethical awareness. Four strategies for the exploration\
    \ of the ethical dimensions of digital\nlivestock farming.\nStrategy 2: Recovery.\
    \ Farmers hope that the animal can recover. Here, we can select\nanimals that\
    \ are able to recover from some condition or disease. “Recovery” is a more\noptimistic\
    \ strategy that focuses on breeding animals that are more resilient to disease\
    \ and\nbetter able to recover from illness. This strategy emphasizes the importance\
    \ of selecting\ndesirable traits and genetics and may involve the use of digital\
    \ phenotyping to identify\nanimals that are better able to recover from certain\
    \ conditions.\nThis solution involves selecting animals that are able to recover\
    \ from certain conditions\nor diseases using digital phenotyping and breeding.\
    \ By selecting desirable traits, such as\ngood heart health or heat resistance,\
    \ farmers can breed healthier animals and reduce the\nrisk of disease or mortality.\
    \ However, this approach can raise concerns about the ethical\nimplications of\
    \ genetic modiﬁcation and selective breeding. It is important to consider the\n\
    potential risks and beneﬁts of these practices and ensure that animals are not\
    \ subjected to\nunnecessary harm or suffering in the process.\nStrategy 3: Resistance.\
    \ This strategy emphasizes the importance of proactive measures\nto prevent illness\
    \ and disease rather than simply reacting to outbreaks as they occur. DLF\ncan\
    \ be used to screen for potential diseases and to monitor animals in real-time,\
    \ allowing\nfarmers to intervene early and prevent the spread of disease.\nThis\
    \ solution involves using inoculations or other forms of protection to prevent\
    \ illness\nin animals, as well as screening and real-time monitoring using digital\
    \ platforms to identify\nand prevent diseases. This approach can be effective\
    \ in reducing disease and mortality\nrates, but it can also raise ethical concerns\
    \ about the use of antibiotics and other treatments\nthat may have negative effects\
    \ on animal health or the environment. It is important to\nbalance the beneﬁts\
    \ of disease prevention with the potential risks and ensure that animals\nare\
    \ not being subjected to unnecessary harm or suffering.\nStrategy 4: Avoidance.\
    \ Here, the farm animal is not concerned with the system. By\nmanipulating the\
    \ environment, disease-causing pathogens are prevented from entering,\nthereby\
    \ protecting the animal. In this way, the animal may be shielded from becoming\n\
    ill, such as by improving hygiene or by sensor technologies that block certain\
    \ factors and\nplayers in the environment. Rather than making the animal ﬁt for\
    \ the environment, by using\ndigital tools, we adapt the environment to the needs\
    \ of the animal. “Avoidance” is a strategy\nthat focuses on adapting the environment\
    \ to meet the needs of the animal. This strategy\nemphasizes the importance of\
    \ providing a healthy and hygienic environment for animals\nAgriEngineering 2023,\
    \ 5\n499\nand may involve the use of sensor technologies to monitor and control\
    \ environmental\nfactors that can affect animal well-being.\nThis solution involves\
    \ manipulating the environment to prevent disease-causing\npathogens from entering,\
    \ using digital tools such as sensor technologies and improved\nhygiene practices.\
    \ This approach can be effective in reducing disease and mortality rates,\nbut\
    \ it can also raise ethical concerns about the impact of these interventions on\
    \ animal\nbehavior and well-being. It is important to ensure that animals are\
    \ not being subjected to\nunnecessary stress or discomfort as a result of these\
    \ interventions and that their natural\nbehaviors and needs are being respected.\n\
    The key to addressing ethical problems in digital livestock farming is to balance\
    \ the\nneed for productivity and proﬁtability with the need to ensure that animals\
    \ are being treated\nhumanely and that their welfare is being prioritized. By\
    \ using a combination of these four\nsolutions, and carefully considering the\
    \ potential risks and beneﬁts of each approach, it is\npossible to develop more\
    \ ethical and sustainable practices in digital livestock farming.\n4. Technological\
    \ Change and Innovation\nAspects of DLF having to do with technological change\
    \ and innovation shall be\ndiscussed. There are currently some interesting novel\
    \ tools and developments happening\nworldwide under the DLF umbrella. However,\
    \ we are at the tip of the iceberg, or at best,\nwe have just started scratching\
    \ the surface. DLF will be here for at least a couple of decades,\nwith many signiﬁcant\
    \ developments still lying ahead of us.\n4.1. Market Growth\nGenerally speaking,\
    \ based on market research analysis, we can say that the precision\nagriculture\
    \ market is projected to reach US $52.3 billion by 2030 at an annual growth rate\
    \ of\n10.67% [37]. This is a large number, but it includes both the crop and livestock\
    \ farming sec-\ntors. Focusing on livestock, veterinary animals and farm animals\
    \ alone, growth would be\naround US $19.37 billion by 2030 [38]. The whole DLF\
    \ market can be categorized into multi-\nple segments (animal monitoring technologies,\
    \ animal biotechnologies, sensors/wearables,\ndata (without the hardware component),\
    \ etc.). We have to look carefully at what context\nthe technologies are being\
    \ applied in while considering these numbers. Obviously, North\nAmerica will be\
    \ the dominant player in the DLF area, followed by Europe, while the core\nand\
    \ seminal R&D work will be led by EU countries.\n4.2. Adoption\nBased on surveys\
    \ done by research groups, we can conﬁdently say that farmers are\nmore than willing,\
    \ and indeed happy, to embrace DLF technologies, as it helps them to cut\ntime\
    \ in farm management and provides convenience, such as remote management and\n\
    predictive capabilities [39]. Nonetheless, there are some reservations in farmers’\
    \ minds.\nOne of the major concerns we hear from them is the narrow proﬁt margins\
    \ and questions\nabout who “owns” the data collected via these tools [40].\nWhen\
    \ mobile phones were introduced 30 years ago, they were very heavy, large\nbrick-like\
    \ objects. People had concerns about their potential to cause job loss, cancer,\
    \ brain\ndamage, and many other issues. And yet, everyone now lives with a mobile\
    \ phone for\nmultiple hours a day. Despite this, not much has resulted in terms\
    \ of disruption regarding\nhealth (generally speaking). The common public has\
    \ adapted, embraced and learned to\nlive with mobile phone technologies. Extrapolating\
    \ on this, we may perhaps conclude\nthat digital livestock farming technology\
    \ will not necessarily lead to bad outcomes down\nthe road.\n4.3. Changes in Worker\
    \ Proﬁles\nWe live in a new world, a digital world. This is a new situation where\
    \ it is not enough\nmerely to regard farmers as laborers who may have extensive\
    \ experience with phenotyping\nand may immediately detect issues affecting livestock,\
    \ together with a pertinent solution.\nAgriEngineering 2023, 5\n500\nRather, we\
    \ must go beyond this paradigm of experience-based competency that may\nbe overly\
    \ reliant on subjectivity. Digitization can introduce a supplemental element of\n\
    objectivity in this respect. This will also reduce the work burden on farmers,\
    \ who will\nproﬁt from the ability of digital technologies and platforms to assist\
    \ in decision-making\nand animal management. If something breaks, the system will\
    \ try to ﬁx it on its own, but\nwith the intervention and approval of the human\
    \ expert or the farmer, creating a dual and\ncomplementary system. This may also\
    \ lead to a new professional class of “digital experts”\nwho may ﬁx things akin\
    \ to how a plumber or electrician may do so when a farmer is not\nable to resolve\
    \ an issue on their own.\nWith respect to more speciﬁc developments in DLF, below\
    \ are a couple of noteworthy\ndevelopments that are inﬂuencing each other:\n4.4.\
    \ Digital Twins\nA digital twin can be deﬁned as “a virtual representation of\
    \ a physical asset enabled\nthrough data and simulators for real-time prediction,\
    \ optimization, monitoring, controlling,\nand improved decision-making” [41].\
    \ In this way, the physical animal may be seen as the\nsource of the data for\
    \ its virtual twin.\nIn the past, farming was entirely based on monitoring physical\
    \ animals, but now\nwe may also use their digital twins as proxies that can be\
    \ used to monitor them without\nphysical contact or direct observation. For example,\
    \ this could replace the need for blood\nsamples, visually measuring and observing\
    \ the animals instead and integrating the sampled\ndata into their virtual twins.\
    \ This represents a gradual shift of balance, in which the “virtual\nanimal” becomes\
    \ increasingly important and inﬂuences the physical animal, as the former\ncan\
    \ be used to make predictions about the latter.\n4.5. Artiﬁcial Intelligence\n\
    Artiﬁcial intelligence can automate the development of analytical models via algo-\n\
    rithms that basically “learn” from data. The algorithms are then able to update\
    \ the models\ncontinuously and instantaneously, paving the path for real-time\
    \ predictions. This offer-\ning of real-time modeling and periodical predictions\
    \ makes AI powerful. However, the\nmodels are restricted to forecasting the effects\
    \ of data that is similar to that obtained in the\npast. AI-enabled models tend\
    \ to produce inaccurate results upon extrapolation beyond\nobserved bounds.\n\
    Biased data or missing data in modeling, with or without an AI-based and data-driven\n\
    method, can provide ﬂawed models while exploring the future based only on the\
    \ past. The\nover-dependence on data-driven models for decision-making based on\
    \ past lessons and\npast experiences in modern animal farming is risky and makes\
    \ the model fragile. This can\nbe a major shortcoming during pandemics or other\
    \ major incidents in animal farming. Data-\ndriven models can indeed be worse\
    \ when developing simulations or prediction platforms\nif they are exposed to\
    \ previously unseen events. However, AI algorithms can overcome\nthis hurdle by\
    \ enabling the prediction of situations and incidents that have never occurred\n\
    before by running hypothetical scenarios outside of conventional bounds. This\
    \ can be\ndone via enhanced theory and causal hypotheses about the farming system\
    \ by taking a\nsystematic approach, thoroughly understanding the processes involved,\
    \ and implementing\nhigh-ﬁdelity methodologies.\nGenerative adversarial networks\
    \ and self-learning approaches come in handy to enable\naccurate predictions about\
    \ various states/phases of livestock farming activity, which can\nthen match the\
    \ predicted output by simulated trajectories. Even a huge volume of “outside-\n\
    the-known-parameter” data can be generated via simulation to train the model to\
    \ such an\nextent that it becomes able to provide critical insights regarding\
    \ unknown future events [10].\nTo be able to create sensible predictions, AI-enabled\
    \ simulations have to precisely\nreﬂect the processes involved in the systems\
    \ to which they are being applied. In terms\nof hybrid modeling (consider a gray\
    \ box model), mixing various modeling paradigms\nAgriEngineering 2023, 5\n501\n\
    is possible via AI approaches, which allows the animal scientist to create a “bouquet”\n\
    (combining multiple ﬂowers from various plants) or a “cocktail” into a powerful\
    \ platform.\nAgent-based simulation models can account for deviations from optimization,\
    \ en-\nvironmental exploitation, or lapses of rationality. The AI models can then\
    \ predict how\nthe system can reconﬁgure itself via “adaptation” in the context\
    \ of animal farming. This\nspeciﬁc capability of AI will allow animal farming\
    \ to stay ahead of human responses and\ninterventions. Methods and technologies\
    \ to build very powerful simulations are available\nalready. The trend now is\
    \ not to rely merely on collecting data from the real world but\nto venture into\
    \ a “metaverse” or “virtual world” and create and develop various “what-\nif scenarios”,\
    \ converting the virtual digital world into trillions of terabytes of data at\
    \ a\nmeager cost.\nResource optimization can be taken to the maximum level via\
    \ digital/smart farming\napproaches. There is a remote possibility of “desire\
    \ discrepancy” due to digitalization,\nwhich may inﬂuence the next generation\
    \ of consumers to refrain from eating artiﬁcially\n“selected” meat in the future.\
    \ For example, it is known that consumers are often reluctant\nto adopt new technology-based\
    \ food, in great measure, on how the technology is pre-\nsented [42]. Due to an\
    \ evolving consciousness caused by digitalization among the Gen Z\nand Gen Alpha\
    \ cohorts, the emphasis on the transparency of meat production would matter\n\
    in making choices about food. However, these are issues that seem eminently addressable\n\
    by ﬁnding approaches to engage productively with consumer attitudes.\n5. Responsible\
    \ Research and Innovation\nResponsible Research and Innovation (RRI) is an approach\
    \ to innovation that seeks\nto integrate ethical, social, and environmental considerations\
    \ [43] into the research and\ninnovation process. It aims to ensure that the development\
    \ and use of new technologies\nalign with the values and needs of society.\nDigital\
    \ livestock farming is an innovative way of managing livestock that uses digital\n\
    technologies such as big data, sensors, and the Internet of Things (IoT) to improve\
    \ efﬁciency\nand productivity. The use of sensors and big data enables farmers\
    \ to collect and analyze\ndata on various aspects of animal health, behavior,\
    \ and performance, helping them to make\ninformed decisions about the management\
    \ of their animals.\nFarmers’ perceptions play a crucial role [44] in the adoption\
    \ of innovation in agri-\nculture. Policymakers and researchers need to understand\
    \ farmers’ views and concerns\nin order to develop policies and technologies that\
    \ are acceptable and useful to farmers.\nThis requires engaging with farmers and\
    \ involving them in the innovation process. By\nunderstanding farmers’ views and\
    \ involving them in the innovation process, we can ensure\nthat the beneﬁts of\
    \ these technologies are shared equitably and that the livestock industry\nbecomes\
    \ more sustainable and resilient.\nIn a digitally focused era, RRI places emphasis\
    \ on engaging stakeholders such as\nfarmers, animal caretakers, researchers, veterinarians,\
    \ animal scientists and policymakers\nin the design and implementation of research\
    \ activities in a bid to ensure that the Digital\nLivestock Farming technologies\
    \ are ethical, safe, and beneﬁcial to society.\n5.1. Ethics, Law, and Governance\n\
    From an ethical standpoint, digital livestock farming raises issues of animal\
    \ rights and\nwelfare, as well as data privacy and security. From a legal perspective,\
    \ the use of digital\ntools for livestock management is subject to existing legislation,\
    \ as well as new laws such\nas GDPR. Finally, from a governance perspective, there\
    \ is a need to ensure that digital\nlivestock farming is regulated in a way that\
    \ is fair and effective.\n5.2. Digital & Precision Livestock Big Data\nOne of\
    \ the key aspects of digital livestock farming is the generation of large amounts\
    \ of\ndata. This data can be used to gain insights into livestock behavior, health,\
    \ and performance.\nIt can also be used to develop digital & precision livestock\
    \ farming systems, which employ\nAgriEngineering 2023, 5\n502\ndata-driven decision-making\
    \ to optimize animal husbandry and production. Big data\nrefers to the massive\
    \ amounts of data generated by various sources, including sensors and\nIoT devices.\
    \ The ethical dimensions of digital livestock farming and the use of big data\n\
    include privacy concerns, data ownership, and the potential for unequal access\
    \ to these\ntechnologies. It is important to ensure that the beneﬁts of these\
    \ technologies are shared\nequitably and that farmers have control over the data\
    \ they generate. The use of big data\nin digital & precision livestock farming\
    \ raises important ethical and legal considerations,\nnamely, the protection of\
    \ data privacy, data security, and transparency. Furthermore, there\nis a need\
    \ to ensure that data-driven decision-making is fair and equitable and that any\n\
    decisions made with the use of big data do not discriminate against certain groups.\n\
    In order for digital livestock farming to revolutionize the way farmers raise\
    \ and\nmanage animals and for this to happen responsibly and ethically, it is\
    \ important to consider\nthe ethical, legal and governance challenges associated\
    \ with this type of farming. The use\nof big data in precision livestock farming\
    \ must be carefully regulated.\n5.3. Micro-Innovations\nMicro-innovations refer\
    \ to small improvements or adaptations [45] made to existing\ntechnologies or\
    \ the development of new ones. In the context of digital livestock farming,\n\
    these innovations can include the use of sensors, big data, and artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ (AI) to\noptimize the management of livestock and improve the sustainability\
    \ of animal agriculture.\nThe ethical and social implications of digital livestock\
    \ farming are signiﬁcant and need to\nbe considered in order to ensure the responsible\
    \ and sustainable development of these tech-\nnologies. For example, privacy concerns\
    \ and data ownership issues need to be addressed\nto ensure that farmers retain\
    \ control over the data they generate and that their rights and\ninterests are\
    \ protected.\nResponsible technological innovation is crucial in ensuring that\
    \ the beneﬁts of digital\nlivestock farming are realized while avoiding any unintended\
    \ consequences that might\nnegatively impact the resilience [46] of the livestock\
    \ industry. The role of technology as a\nmediator of resilience-enhancing social\
    \ behavior should not be underestimated, as it can\nhelp animal farmers to adopt\
    \ more sustainable practices and overcome uncertainties and\nchallenges they face.\n\
    Micro-innovations in digital livestock farming have the potential to improve the\n\
    efﬁciency and sustainability of animal agriculture, but it is important to approach\
    \ these\ninnovations responsibly and with consideration for the ethical and social\
    \ implications\ninvolved. By taking a responsible and holistic approach to technological\
    \ innovation, we\ncan ensure that the beneﬁts of these technologies are shared\
    \ equitably and that the livestock\nindustry becomes more resilient and sustainable.\n\
    6. Summary\nThe ethics of digital livestock farming is an emerging ﬁeld that focuses\
    \ on the ethical\nimplications of using digital technologies in animal agriculture.\
    \ As the use of digital\ntechnologies in agriculture continues to grow, there\
    \ are several key areas where future\nresearch in the ethics of digital livestock\
    \ farming is likely to focus:\nAnimal welfare: One of the most important ethical\
    \ considerations in digital livestock\nfarming is the impact of digital technologies\
    \ on animal welfare. Future research is likely\nto focus on developing and implementing\
    \ digital technologies that can improve animal\nwelfare, such as sensors and other\
    \ monitoring devices that can detect signs of distress or\nillness in animals\
    \ and trigger appropriate interventions.\nData privacy and ownership: Another\
    \ key ethical concern in digital livestock farming\nis the collection, storage,\
    \ and use of data generated by digital technologies. Future research\nwill need\
    \ to address issues of data privacy and ownership to ensure that farmers and other\n\
    stakeholders have control over the data generated by these technologies and that\
    \ it is used\nin an ethical and responsible manner.\nAgriEngineering 2023, 5\n\
    503\nEnvironmental sustainability: Digital livestock farming has the potential\
    \ to improve\nthe environmental sustainability of animal agriculture by reducing\
    \ waste, improving efﬁ-\nciency, and decreasing the environmental impact of livestock\
    \ production. Future research\nwill need to explore the environmental beneﬁts\
    \ and costs of different digital technologies\nand their impact on the overall\
    \ sustainability of animal agriculture.\nLabor and social justice: Digital livestock\
    \ farming is likely to have a signiﬁcant impact\non the labor market in agriculture,\
    \ and there are concerns about the impact of these\ntechnologies on farmworkers\
    \ and their communities. Future research will need to address\nissues of labor\
    \ and social justice in the context of digital livestock farming, including the\n\
    potential for automation to displace human workers and the need to ensure fair\
    \ labor\npractices and working conditions.\nEthical governance: Finally, future\
    \ research in the ethics of digital livestock farming\nwill need to address issues\
    \ of ethical governance, including the development of standards\nand guidelines\
    \ for the responsible use of digital technologies in animal agriculture and the\n\
    establishment of regulatory frameworks that can ensure that these technologies\
    \ are used in\nan ethical and responsible manner.\nTo achieve a more ethical approach\
    \ to DLF, there needs to be a shift in the goals and\nvalues of livestock farming,\
    \ moving beyond proﬁt as the sole objective. The use of DLF can\naid in this ethical\
    \ pursuit by providing tools and techniques to improve animal welfare,\nreduce\
    \ environmental impacts, and promote sustainable practices.\nResearch on the ethical\
    \ implications of DLF is a growing ﬁeld, and many organizations\nand researchers\
    \ are actively engaged in studying the impact of DLF on animal welfare,\nenvironmental\
    \ sustainability, and ethical considerations. For example, organizations such\n\
    as the World Wildlife Fund, the Humane Society, and Compassion in World Farming\
    \ are\nactively involved in researching and advocating for ethical practices in\
    \ livestock farming,\nincluding the use of DLF.\nFurthermore, academic research\
    \ in ﬁelds such as animal science, agricultural engineer-\ning, and computer science\
    \ is also exploring the potential beneﬁts and ethical implications of\nDLF. For\
    \ instance, researchers are exploring the use of digital biomarkers to monitor\
    \ animal\nhealth and welfare, the use of precision feeding systems to reduce feed\
    \ waste and improve\nnutrient utilization, and the use of predictive analytics\
    \ to improve herd management and\nreduce environmental impacts.\nAchieving ethical\
    \ DLF requires a multidisciplinary approach involving collaboration\nbetween stakeholders\
    \ such as farmers, researchers, industry organizations, and animal\nwelfare advocates.\
    \ It also requires a commitment to ongoing research and evaluation of the\nimpact\
    \ of DLF on animal welfare, environmental sustainability, and ethical considerations\
    \ to\nensure that technological advancements are used in a responsible and sustainable\
    \ manner.\nThe digital farming revolution is just beginning, and it calls for\
    \ a conscientious civic\nengagement of all the parties involved, including farmers,\
    \ scientists, ethicists, and con-\nsumers. In this way, DLF is a prime example\
    \ of the complex interconnections that make us\nall co-actors in the construction\
    \ of a common future.\nFunding: This research received no external funding.\n\

    to 5G-enabled wireless access networks for social robots in public spaces (SRPS).
    The use of social robots (SR) in public areas requires specific Quality of Service
    (QoS) planning to meet its unique requirements. Its 5G threat landscape entails
    more than cybersecurity threats that most previous studies focus on. This study
    examines the 5G wireless RAN for SRPS from three perspectives: SR and wireless
    access points, the ad hoc network link between SR and user devices, and threats
    to SR and users’ communication equipment. The paper analyses the security threats
    to confidentiality, integrity, availability, authentication, authorisation, and
    privacy from the SRPS security objectives perspective. We begin with an overview
    of SRPS use cases and access network requirements, followed by 5G security standards,
    requirements, and the need for a more representative threat landscape for SRPS.
    The findings confirm that the RAN of SRPS is most vulnerable to physical, side-channel,
    intrusion, injection, manipulation, and natural and malicious threats. The paper
    presents existing mitigation to the identified attacks and recommends including
    physical level security (PLS) and post-quantum cryptography in the early design
    of SRPS. The insights from this survey will provide valuable risk assessment and
    management input to researchers, industrial practitioners, policymakers, and other
    stakeholders of SRPS. Security Threats to 5G Networks for Social Robots in Public

  description: Industrial control systems (ICSs) are complex systems due to the technology
    and protocol diversity they contain. Operational Technology (OT), an ICS operating
    structure, has different performance and security requirements than the standard
    IT infrastructure. ICS systems consist of field devices where operational processes
    take place and control systems that provide management of these devices. Attackers
    are involved in the whole process after gaining access from the control layer.
    As a result, critical infrastructure systems are threatened by cyber-attacks.
    Therefore, continuous monitoring and security audits are also necessary processes
    for critical infrastructures. In this study, studies on the cyberattack and detection
    system were carried out on the critical infrastructures of the water management
    process. On the EtherCAT-based water management process, six different attack
    vectors for field devices were developed by the techniques in the MITRE ICS ATT&CK
    matrix, and these attacks were separated by data obtained from network traffic
    and determined by the SVM algorithm. Attack scenarios were created by selecting
    seven different MITRE ICS ATT&CK matrix techniques for attacks on the SCADA system
    in the control center via the engineering computer on the same process. Wazuh
    HIDS was used for the intrusion detection system for the SCADA system. Visualization
    of both attacks was done on ELK.
  doi: 10.1109/ISDFS52919.2021.9486331
  explanation: The paper titled "Attack Simulation and Detection on EtherCAT Based
    Drinking Water System" examines the vulnerabilities and proposes detection mechanisms
    for cyberattacks targeting EtherCAT-based drinking water systems. It specifically
    focuses on intrusion detection for both field devices and the SCADA system in
    the control center, utilizing machine learning algorithms and Wazuh HIDS. The
    paper contributes to the broader field of automated irrigation systems by emphasizing
    the importance of security and access control in the context of IoT and machine
    learning integration.
  extract_1: '"In industrial control systems, existing and new attacks continue to
    threaten organizations. Due to its critical impact on both financial and human
    life, it is crucial to manage, detect and prevent security vulnerabilities to
    prevent these attacks."'
  extract_2: '"The attacks and detection system do not offer a solution for zero-day
    vulnerabilities. With this study, the machine learning algorithm for the field
    level for detecting cyber attacks that may occur at the factory level against
    the EtherCAT protocol; An intrusion detection system with Wazuh HIDS was developed
    for the control center."'

    (ICSs) are complex systems due to the technology and protocol diversity they contain.
    Operational Technology (OT), an ICS operating structure, has different performance
    and security requirements than the standard IT infrastructure. ICS systems consist
    of field devices where operational processes take place and control systems that
    provide management of these devices. Attackers are involved in the whole process
    after gaining access from the control layer. As a result, critical infrastructure
    systems are threatened by cyber-attacks. Therefore, continuous monitoring and
    security audits are also necessary processes for critical infrastructures. In
    this study, studies on the cyberattack and detection system were carried out on
    the critical infrastructures of the water management process. On the EtherCAT-based
    water management process, six different attack vectors for field devices were
    developed by the techniques in the MITRE ICS ATT&CK matrix, and these attacks
    were separated by data obtained from network traffic and determined by the SVM
    algorithm. Attack scenarios were created by selecting seven different MITRE ICS
    ATT&CK matrix techniques for attacks on the SCADA system in the control center
    via the engineering computer on the same process. Wazuh HIDS was used for the
    intrusion detection system for the SCADA system. Visualization of both attacks
    was done on ELK. Published in: 2021 9th International Symposium on Digital Forensics

    IEEE Conference Location: Elazig, Turkey SECTION I. Introduction ICS is the intersection
    of the physical world and the cyber world. Therefore, the system requirements
    and the operation of the processes are a little more complicated than the standard
    informatics infrastructure. To give an example to industrial control systems,
    systems that have an essential place in daily life, such as energy distribution
    systems, water management systems, intelligent transportation systems, natural
    gas distribution systems, are the main ones. Especially in recent times, the risk
    has increased substantially with the enabling of remote use and control of industrial
    control devices. In other words, while the systems were previously operated in
    isolation, the cyber-physical structure has now become integrated. In a study
    conducted by IBM [1], cyber attacks on the OT side where critical infrastructures
    are running indicate an increase of 2,000 percent. This increase is one of the
    main reasons for the expansion of attack surfaces for cyber attackers due to decreasing
    controls as institutions and industrial structures grow. Therefore, it has become
    necessary to operate cybersecurity processes such as security controls in critical
    infrastructures, continuous system monitoring, periodic penetration tests, and
    follow-up of related systems tightening. When literature studies are analyzed,
    there are different approaches for attack detection systems. Machine learning-based
    detection systems [2], [3], [4] detection system development by open source IDS
    tools [5], and detection with categorical based classification [6], [7] are some
    of these approaches. As can be seen from the literature examples, although intrusion
    detection methods in ICS are carried out with various tools, new methods continue
    to be developed. We used two different detection systems in this study. (1) SVM
    algorithm for attacks on field devices in drinking water systems, (2) Wazuh HIDS
    [8] for attacks on the SCADA system via the engineering workstation. The attack
    vectors were created using the techniques in the MITRE ICS ATT&CK matrix [9].
    The detection system has been visualized in the ELK environment. The organizational
    structure of the study is as follows: In Section 2, theoretical information about
    MITRE ICS ATT&CK, EtherCAT protocol within the experimental method; Attack vectors
    for field devices and engineering computers, and application information for detection
    are included. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: in Section II, some
    background information is briefly described; in Section III, methodology about
    attack vectors Section IV, conclusions are given. SECTION II. BACKGROUND A. MITRE
    ATT&CK Matrix MITRE ATT&CK Matrix [10] is database consists of tactics and techniques
    based on known cyber-attacks. This open and accessible structure is open to continuous
    improvement. It significantly contributes to the systematic performance of various
    tests for red and blue teams. MITRE ATT&CK techniques and procedures provide behavioral
    observability to detect attacks by analyzing the network and end systems [7].
    MITRE ATT&CK Matrix is improved continuously, and there are three types of MITRE
    Matrix: Enterprise [10], Mobile [11], and ICS [12]. We used the MITRE ICS ATT&CK
    Matrix type for our study. Due to the diversity of assets in industrial control
    systems, the ICS ATT&CK matrix was created focusing on the functional levels of
    the Purdue architecture and asset classes to make the correct classification [9].
    While each title in the matrix defines a tactical name, techniques used for the
    relevant tactic are described under each heading. A technique can be classified
    under more than one tactic according to its intended use. There are 11 tactics
    and 81 techniques in the existing ICS Matrix. The matrix shows us which method
    APT attacks like Stuxnet, BlackEnergy, Havex, Etc—followed for damage to the critical
    infrastructure by APT groups. We used ICS Matrix in our study to create the Attack
    scenario in Section III. B. WAZUH Host-Based IDS and Sysmon Wazuh [13] is an open-source
    host-based intrusion detection system. It provides multiple functionalities like
    integrity monitoring, security monitoring, incident response, vulnerability management,
    etc. With the triggering of relevant events in the system, alarms are created,
    and potential threats are detected early, preventing severe attacks. Additional
    alarm rules can be written to the default alarm rules. Wazuh can be used in various
    architectures [14] depending on the intended use and system size. System Monitor
    (Sysmon) is the Windows system service and device driver for monitoring system
    activity and logging system events in the Windows event log. Provides detailed
    information about process creation processes, network connections, and changes
    in the file creation time [15]. We located this tool on the engineering workstation
    the collect critical events. SECTION III. METHODOLOGY In this section, we describe
    our methodology to attacks and detection techniques on EtherCAT-based Water Management
    System. Our study consist of two main approaches: making an attack by MITRE techniques
    and detection methods for these attack techniques. The detection system includes
    two particular solutions for end point (Engineering Workstation) systems and field
    device (PLC) systems. A. Testbed Environment The test environment topology includes
    managing a total of 4 stations, including one treatment station, two pumping stations,
    and one warehouse. Each station has PLC and I/O equipment for control (Fig 1).
    There are also key devices, an engineering station for configuration and programming,
    ET2000 probe devices for passive network listening, and an HMI panel (Fig 2) for
    management/monitoring. Our study was carried out in real devices and modeled water
    process in Sakarya University Critical Infrastructure National Testbed [16] center.
    B. Attack Vectors for ICS Network This section discusses the safety aspect of
    using the EtherCAT protocol at the factory level. The Ethercat protocol does not
    contain basic security parameters such as standard authentication, encryption,
    and authorization used in information technologies. Therefore, media access control
    has been vulnerable to leaks, remote data acquisition, and other advanced attacks
    requiring advanced information. There are various EtherCAT protocol-based anomaly
    detection methods in the literature: machine learning for device level [4], periodicity-based
    [17], and fuzzing methods [18]. However, we analyze AMS and EAP sub-protocols
    that enable EtherCAT to communicate at factory level, which is not in other studies.
    Fig. 1. Testbed environment Show All Fig. 2. Evacuation scenerio control screen
    Show All TABLE I. MITRE ICS ATT&CK Tecnhiques T0855 attack in Table I, EAP communication,
    which carries the data information between PLC devices, rested from the Probe
    (ET2000) device in the test environment. The water level was changed, and the
    water was pumped into the filled water container as if there was a small amount
    of water. The system has been manipulated by running the motors that should not
    work in the same way. T0816 and T0858 attacks in Table I, PLC configuration statuses
    are transmitted via AMS protocol. With the TwinCAT program running on the engineering
    computer for AMS communication, during the transition of PLCs from working to
    configuration state, network registration was recorded with ET2000 device. When
    the saved AMS PCAP file is examined, the ADS State field has been changed for
    PLC devices to switch from working to configuration. C++ code developed to make
    for these attack vectors in the testbed. T0814 attack in Table I, With high network
    traffic over a single source, the running system has been able to stop the water
    treatment process. The PCAP file received from the system was stopped by creating
    a large number of network flows by giving the loop parameter 5000000 of the tcpreplay
    tool in the Kali operating system. C. Attack Vectors for End Point Systems Many
    APT attacks on natural systems have been carried out by taking advantage of the
    lack of security controls such as misconfiguration, no security tightening, or
    lack of authentication. There are various social engineering methods to provide
    initial access to the system. In this study, assuming the attacker is in Layer
    3 of the Purdue architecture, possible APT scenarios have been implemented on
    the existing water process. The scenarios realized were created according to the
    tactics and techniques in the MITRE ICS ATT&CK matrix. In our study, we create
    two attacks scenario for simulating APT behaviors. We selected techniques from
    the MITRE ICS ATT&CK matrix step by step for two attack scenarios (Fig 3). 1)
    Attack Scenario 1 There are three different scenarios in the water process based
    on the various working principles of motors and valves, namely evacuation, circulation,
    and treatment. In the evacuation scenario, the motors of the dam in the system
    do not work typically. The attack vector aims to make the motors in the dam run
    when the evacuation scenario is selected. Step 1: Initial Access/ Replication
    Through Removable Media (T0847), A USB device that includes reverse shell exe
    to attacker machine is attached to engineering workstation. Step 2: Initial Access/
    Engineering Workstation Compromise (T0818), The previous technique provides that
    attacker access to engineering workstation persistently. The \"Migrate\" process
    has been done to continue in privileged mode on the engineering computer. While
    performing the \"migrate\" process, \"RtkAudioService64.exe\", a process belonging
    to the system user, was made according to the process number. Step 3: Discovery/
    Remote System Discovery (T0846), Using the MAC addresses in the ARP table of the
    engineering computer, the model of Ethernet cards was determined to be Beckhoff
    PLC. Step 4: Lateral Movement / Program Organization Units (T0844), The TwinCAT
    development environment of the program required for the development and installation
    of the program that enables the control of Beckhoff PLC devices has been found
    in the internet environment. The processes running on the target computer are
    listed, and the POU file containing the PLC codes has been found on the engineering
    workstation machine. The POU file was downloaded from the engineering workstation
    to the attacker machine via injected malicious exe file. Dam motors have been
    changed to TRUE in the condition of scenario_secim=3 in Fig 4. Step 5: Execution/
    Project File Infection (T0873), PLC logic control code changed in the previous
    step. However, this change in the attacker machine, not in the engineering workstation.
    The changed POU file was uploaded to the same directory in the engineering workstation.
    Step 6: Impair Process Control/ Modify Control Logic (T0833); for the logical
    change made in the previous technique to be effective in PLCs, the \"Activate
    Configuration\" process must be done by the TwinCAT program. An attacker machine
    caused this process. Fig. 3. MITRE ICS ATT&CK techniques Show All Fig. 4. PLC
    POU file Show All Step 7: Impact/ Manipulation of Control (T0831), As a result
    of all steps, when the \"Evacuation Scenario\" is selected from the HMI interface
    in the water process, the control has been changed to unauthorized by ensuring
    that the motors that should not work for the dam will run. 2) Attack Scenario
    2 In the water process, attack vectors have been applied to the PLC device that
    controls the treatment tank to perform the same operations regardless of the scenario
    selection. An essential step in this attack, different from the previous one,
    is to ensure persistence through routing the engineering computer to the C&C server
    (Fig 5). Step 1 and Step 2 are performed by applying the same method as specified
    in Attack scenario 1. Step 3: Persistence/ Program Download(T0843), Although this
    technique in the ICS matrix is not defined for the engineering computer, it has
    been interpreted in this technique because it has a similar effect. The .vbs code
    connected from the Kali virtual machine to the Ubuntu 19.10 virtual machine has
    been created on the engineering computer. Thus, it was transferred to the C&C
    server, where the commands to continue the attack will be executed. Since the
    .vbs code created in the engineering workstation can communicate with C&C when
    the computer is turned off and on again, persistence has been achieved on the
    system. Fig. 5. Attack flow of Attack scenario 2 Show All Step 4: Discovery/ Network
    Sniffing (T0842) and Network Connection Enumeration (T0840), Packages sniffed
    from the engineering computer were examined. The AMS sub-protocol of the EtherCAT
    protocol was detected from the network traffic. Step 5: Lateral Movement/ Program
    Organization Units (T0844), same as Step5 in attack scenario 1. Step 6: Execution/
    Project File Infection(T0873), same as Step 5 in attack scenario 1. Step 7: Impact/
    Manipulation of Control (T0831), As a result of this attack, the working principle
    of the PLC device, which controls the water process in the water treatment tank,
    did not change regardless of the scenario selected on the HMI screen. Manipulation
    occurred in the control center. D. Anomaly Detection and Visualization for ICS
    Network SVM algorithm was used to detect the attack vectors created in the previous
    section. According to the detection program of the attacks carried out at the
    factory level, learning is carried out from the traffic flowing in real-time.
    The parameters to be used to detect attacks from this learning are parsed and
    saved in the CSV file. The model formed as a result of the learning has been kept
    in a file. Subsequent attacks were evaluated according to this model, and the
    states of PLC devices were classified. Classified attacks were transferred to
    the ELK system and visualized. The flow given in Fig 6 was realized on Ubuntu
    19 with Python3 programming language. A linear SVM algorithm is used. In the learning
    part of the SVM algorithm, five attributes are used as features. These are defined
    in Table II according to their intended use. Fig. 6. Anomaly detection for ICS
    Network Show All TABLE II. Features for SVM Algorithm An open-source ELK Stack
    is used to visualize the attacks. The log files resulting from the SVM attacks
    were transferred to the ELK machine with filebeat. Dashboard screens, where detailed
    data of attacks are displayed graphically, have been created in Kibana (Fig 7).
    Fig. 7. Anomaly detection dashboard Show All E. Anomaly Detection and Visualization
    for End Point Systems Wazuh open source HIDS was used to detect the attacks carried
    out in section C. The ossec-agent component that sends events to the Wazuh tool
    is installed in the engineering computer. The agent sends its logs to the central
    server (Fig 9). The alarms on the main server will be displayed on the Kibana
    interface thanks to the Wazuh extension installed on Kibana. Sysmon tool is also
    included in Wazuh alarms to monitor logs that do not generate default, such as
    process create/delete, WMI Event. The rule file has been reconfigured for the
    Sysmon tool to classify techniques [19] in the MITRE ATT&CK Enterprise matrix.
    The analysis of the attacks in the C part according to the events that took place
    in the engineering computer was made as follows: As a result of the \"migrate\"
    process of both attack scenarios in Step 2, a new process operating under the
    same process is formed. This situation causes a \"File Create\" type log to be
    created in Sysmon with Event ID = 11 value. The \"File Create\" event is significant
    as it detects newly created suspicious files. The alarm of this event is indicated
    in Fig 8. Fig. 8. Wazuh file create alarm Show All In Step 3 of the attack scenario
    2, a file consisting of random letters is created in the engineering computer
    to direct the .vbs code to the C&C server and provide persistence. C&C server
    and engineering computer communicate by accessing this file. Therefore, the alarm
    similar to specified in Fig 8 occurs. Fig. 9. Wazuh HIDS Workflow Show All Various
    graphs have been created in the Kibana tool to analyze alarms with appropriate
    filters quickly. These graphs are collected in a dashboard structure. For example,
    in attack scenarios, a continuous connection is provided during the sending of
    commands. Therefore, since the connection process is accessed chiefly (185) (Fig
    10), the \"Process Access\" rule is unified. Fig. 10. Process access count by
    event log count Show All SECTION IV. CONCLUSIONS In industrial control systems,
    existing and new attacks continue to threaten organizations. Due to its critical
    impact on both financial and human life, it is crucial to manage, detect and prevent
    security vulnerabilities to prevent these attacks. In our study, a solution proposal
    has been developed that provides possible attacks and detection of both end point
    devices and SCADA system in an EtherCAT-based water process. The attacks and detection
    system do not offer a solution for zero-day vulnerabilities. With this study,
    the machine learning algorithm for the field level for detecting cyber attacks
    that may occur at the factory level against the EtherCAT protocol; An intrusion
    detection system with Wazuh HIDS was developed for the control center. The monitoring
    of devices is facilitated with the ELK system, which is integrated to monitor
    the system. It was ensured that information about essential criteria such as analysis
    of attacks over time and tracking system vulnerabilities was obtained through
    both visual and numerical ratios. If it is desired to get instant information
    from the operations performed in the test environment, it is possible to add visuals.
    In future studies, solutions for both attack and detection can be diversified
    on this matrix. Periodic up-to-date studies of this matrix can also provide continuous
    traceability of the system. When the logs generated by the Wazuh server are generated
    at certain levels, they direct them to the SIEM product, allowing a more comprehensive
    correlation. Network-based monitoring can be done by setting up NIDS in water
    process communication and sending network-based events to the Wazuh server for
    analysis. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics Footnotes More

  description: Each and every nation in the globe has very crucial infrastructures
    that offer crucial services like internet activity, energy, banking and finance,
    crucial public services, transportation, and water management. For vital infrastructure
    based on sectors, each nation has a unique strategy. As IoT-based solutions proliferate,
    these crucial infrastructures now have network and Internet connectivity. Consequently,
    these crucial systems that are a part of information networks are equally vulnerable
    to online attacks. It is crucial to recognise the potential cyber-attack types,
    devise defence strategies, and implement various preventative measures. In the
    present day, it is critical to protect potential cyberattacks on these vital infrastructures.
    The most common attacks on crucial infrastructures are looked at in this study,
    especially those that have recently happened. Security precautions are also discussed
    with a view to reducing or preventing IP-based intrusions. The Internet of Things
    is the next step in machine-to-machine connectivity. IoT has made it possible
    for anything to be online nowadays. IoT also refers to the networking of uniquely
    identified, pervasive computing devices that have the ability to transmit data
    over a network without necessarily requiring or machine-to-human interaction.

  explanation: The paper examines the growing cybersecurity threats and the increasing
    need for robust authentication systems in the modern digital age. The study focuses
    on secondary data analysis to investigate various aspects of cybersecurity threats
    and authentication systems, emphasizing the significance of securing vital infrastructures.
    It highlights the vulnerabilities of IoT-based critical infrastructures and discusses
    notable cyberattacks that have targeted such systems in recent years.
  extract_1: IoT technologies have made it feasible to sense and control almost anything
    nowadays. IoT also refers to the networking of uniquely identified, pervasive
    computing devices that have the ability to transmit data over a network without
    necessarily requiring or machine-to-human interaction.
  extract_2: Attackers have improved their cyberattack capabilities, yet the majority
    of the critical infrastructure systems in use today still rely on antiquated technologies
    that are open to low-tech cyberattacks.

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Greater Noida, India SECTION I. Introduction
    IoT has enabled the connection of an increasing number of devices to the Internet.
    Additionally, modern IoT technologies make it possible to sense and control almost
    anything online. IoT is a useful innovation, but it can also pose a serious cybersecurity
    risk to vital infrastructure. Given that there may be many security flaws in the
    entry points, there is a significant potential risk to cyber security in this
    case. A hole in the company''s quality chain could leave the whole thing vulnerable
    to security breaches and open the door for potential attackers. To defend the
    countries'' vital infrastructures, these significant cyber-security risks must
    be specifically avoided. As IoT programs are utilised more regularly, security
    problems grow [1]. When Advanced technologies are used in vital facilities, serious
    cyber-security problems invariably arise. Cyberattacks on crucial infrastructure
    would result in catastrophe. Destructive scenarios include turning off a hospital''s
    electricity, changing the temperature of a nuclear power plant''s cooling towers,
    and using smart automobiles'' inmotion functions. Critical national infrastructures
    are increasingly being targeted by hackers who want to commit cybertheft, cyberespionage,
    harassment, disruption, and cyberterrorism. Even a cyber-attack mostly on facilities
    of another country might be used to justify going to war. Consequently, an important
    subject for securing a nation is cyber-security. A nation''s or organization''s
    physical systems may be destroyed, their control may be transferred to a third
    party, they may become dysfunctional, or the privacy of individuals'' data may
    be compromised through cyberattacks. This article examines cyber-attacks on critical
    infrastructures, focusing in particular on research completed between 2008 and
    2019. Cyberattacks on various critical infrastructures were categorised, and the
    harm done to the systems by these attacks was exposed [2]. The losses that these
    systems will cause, which are crucial for nations, are also priceless monetarily.
    Therefore, methods to lessen or stop these attacks are covered. This essay''s
    remaining sections are organised as follows. This section also looks at a timeline
    of recent attacks. In this context, steps that can be undertaken to lessen or
    stop cyberattacks on crucial infrastructures are looked at. SECTION II. Literature
    Review There are many benefits and uses for AI, including safety. Given the present
    fast expansion of cybercrime and the proliferation of devices, machine-learning
    and artificial intelligence can assist stay by automating detection capabilities
    and responding more quickly than traditional software or human-driven systems,
    up with hackers. The advantages and applications of using AI in defence are discussed
    above. Artificial intelligence may help in the monitoring of cyber risks and potentially
    risky behaviour. This is an area where AI can really help, as traditional software
    systems struggle to keep up with the massive quantity of new diseases that are
    created every week [3]. AI systems are made to recognise viruses, do multivariate
    regression, and even the simplest objects, types of malware and ransomware attacks
    to prevent them from infect the system. This is done by applying complex algorithms.
    Improved predictive intelligence is provided by computer language, It collects
    expertise for itself by researching about cybercrime in books, journals, and studies.
    This can include details on recently found anomalies, malicious programs, and
    defences. Hackers are trend-followers, thus what they consider to be popular regularly
    shifts. AI-based cybersecurity products have the ability to give the most updated
    stats about regional and global dangers, improving the formulation of crucial
    priorities based not only on the likelihood that systems will be hacked but also
    on the most common methods of doing so. The majority of internet traffic nowadays
    is made up of bots, which could be dangerous. Bots could be a serious problem,
    from exploiting private accounts to creating false accounts and stealing data
    [4]. Automated threats cannot be defeated by manual responses alone. AI and machine
    learning enable the ability to distinguish between beneficial and dangerous users
    and bots, as well as to fully understand web traffic. The processing of enormous
    amounts of data is made easier by AI, which also helps cybersecurity teams change
    their strategies in reaction to shifting threat environments. Businesses can utilise
    behavioural patterns to distinguish between a harmful atypical trip and an ordinary
    user trip. By using this information, we can ascertain the reason why they visited
    the page, giving us the upper hand over hazardous bots and defeating them. AI
    can help secure all of the remote-working technology that is quickly increasing.
    Although they primarily rely on signatures, VPN services and antivirus programs
    can assist guard against online malware and virus attacks [5]. It''s possible
    that the antivirus application wasn''t maintained or the software developers were
    unaware if virus categorization are behind schedule. As a result, signature defence
    may be able to stop an attack even if a new type of malware is found. Endpoint
    security powered by AI adopts a novel approach by building a foundation of conclusion
    of the course through an ongoing learning cycle. AI is able to recognise anomalies
    and take the appropriate action, such as alerting a technician or moving to a
    safe location in the event of a virus assault. Instead of waiting for signature
    updates, this provides proactive threat avoidance [6]. Fraudsters attempt to access
    internal systems, leaving a digital trace known as invasion signatures. Security
    experts collect huge data of digital footprints to help identify loopholes and
    specific attack methods for future usage. If a large enough database of fingerprint
    and assault behaviours is made available, an artificial intelligence system can
    be trained to recognise breaches in real time. For instance, getting into electronic
    equipment like laptops, recorders, and other devices that have an internet connection
    is one of the finest ways to exploit. The default login credentials are used by
    scammers to log into various systems. Cybercriminals can gain access to the rest
    of the internet by taking full control of these workstations. By scanning the
    entire connection for these flaws, AI encryption can stop the majority of prevalent
    types of assaults. In reality, artificial intelligence (AI) is just a tool, and
    individuals still need to direct it and discipline it when it makes mistakes [7].
    MasterCard has introduced a fraud protection system that uses artificial intelligence
    and computers based on anticipated user behaviour. To assess if a transaction
    is odd, it looks at the buyer''s typical buying habits, the seller, the event''s
    location, and a number of other intricate algorithms. Several teams successfully
    demonstrated the creation of solutions, the design of weaknesses, and the dissemination
    of attacks. Hackers can also exploit learning-based systems in a number of ways.
    Researchers gave an illustration of how messing with self-driving cars'' perception
    of traffic signs could fool them. software. They were able to train the automobiles
    to recognise street signs by employing simple techniques like graffiti and artwork.
    Cybercriminals must first assault classification methods that the AI has been
    trained to identify and exploit in order to beat artificial intelligence cybersecurity
    [8]. SECTION III. Research Methodology In this current age of digitalization,
    cybersecurity threats can be considered the greatest concern, and the need for
    authentication systems has become apparent. The purpose of the research is to
    examine cybersecurity threats and authentication systems. Previously many researchers
    have already published various research about the concerned topic. Although both
    primary and secondary data were essential for this particular research, the researchers
    have focused specifically on secondary data only. Secondary data refers to collected
    data sets obtained by any other person. With the help of secondary data, the researchers
    were able to analyse a large amount of high-quality data to answer the research
    questions more efficiently. The key reasons for considering secondary data include
    its economic use of time and resources, its uniqueness, and providing a detailed
    picture, helping build useful relationships, it tends to be high-quality, and
    secondary data is useful for data enrichment. SECTION IV. Analysis And Discussion
    Attackers have improved their cyberattack capabilities, yet the majority of the
    critical infrastructure systems in use today still rely on antiquated technologies
    that are open to low-tech cyberattacks. It is a frightening situation that vital
    infrastructures are becoming more interconnected through IoT technology and that
    there are more orchestrated cyberattacks occurring globally. There have been cyberattacks
    on SCADA control systems used by many vital infrastructures in recent years. The
    most notable ones include Stuxnet, Havex, BlackEnergy, & Industroyer. It is obvious
    that the ransomware, which targets vital infrastructures including water treatment
    facilities, gas processing facilities, hydroelectric dams, and transportation
    networks, is expertly made and specialised [9]. Many IoT-based devices are incorporated
    into the vital communication infrastructures. By 2025, there will be 75 billion
    ways to connect, which might make things worse. However, it''s possible that attacks
    on crucial facilities may increase in the future. In the figure below, the main
    sectors of vital infrastructure are depicted. These crucial infrastructures could
    be vulnerable to cyberattacks because they were built using IoT-based solutions.
    The most popular technologies for enhancing critical infrastructures are those
    that are IoT-based. A device can be connected to the Internet if it has an IP
    address. Thanks to the present Internet infrastructure, it is conceivable to declare
    that every device that is linked to the web falls within the IoT idea. IoT devices
    could therefore be vulnerable to almost any hacks that could happen in IP-based
    environments. IoT applications are hampered by the Internet''s security flaws.
    As a result, there are some cyber-security flaws in this new technology. The most
    significant IoT-based cyberattacks in the industry and the risks they pose to
    vital infrastructures are discussed in this section [10]. Fig. 1. Smart Grid Electricity
    Transmission Process Show All Fig. 2. Major Critical Infrastructure Sectors Show
    All Fig. 3. Cyber Security Issues Show All Tramway Hacking: A youngster used a
    homemade transmitter to reroute trains to hack the Lodz city tram system. This
    was the first cyber-kinetic assault to cause some injuries. Hacking at a power
    company: An employee who was fired from his job shut down the company''s power
    forecasting systems by breaking into the network. The attacker accomplished this
    by using his login credentials, which were left unblocked by system administrators.
    Stuxnet: This cyberattack is suspected to have been conducted out by the governments
    of the United States and Israel. By disrupting centrifuges that enrich uranium
    at the nuclear facility, Stuxnet sought to end Iran''s nuclear programme. Stuxnet
    attacked SCADA systems by focusing on PLCs, which allow electromechanical processes
    to be automated. Water Delivery System Hacking: The sanitary sewer department''s
    water distribution system was compromised. The attackers then displayed a few
    screenshots of system diagrams for wastewater and water treatment facilities.
    Additionally, a multiple passwords was used to secure the system, which demonstrated
    how simple it is to launch a remote assault by intercepting the password [11].
    Cyber-attack on a dam: The attackers gained unauthorised access to the Bowman
    Avenue Dam''s SCADA system, where they were able to collect information on activities
    such as water levels, temperatures, and device status. It demonstrated how simple
    it is for attackers to alter the water flow settings, the quantity of chemicals
    used to treat the water, and release the shutters during a downpour. The incident
    is also a perfect example of the enormous damage that such a cyberattack against
    vital IoT systems might bring about. Energy Distribution Hacking: Through the
    SCADA system, terrorists were able to take over control of Ukraine''s power grid.
    Due to this, there was a blackout that caused roughly 700,000 people to experience
    some time without power. With this cyberattack based on the Internet of Things,
    attackers are allegedly testing the most sophisticated sabotage software [12].
    Dynamic DDoS Attack: The Mirai botnet was employed in the DDoS attack. The Mirai
    botnet hunts for IoT devices with weak security and default logins and passwords
    by scanning the internet. Additionally, it is in charge of massive DDoS assaults
    against Dyn servers, an ISP. Due to the fact that many users did not alter their
    devices'' default login credentials, this assault was largely successful. Many
    websites, including Reddit, Twitter, Netflix, and Spotify, might not be accessible
    for a day. Ransomware Attack on San Francisco''s Light Rail System: A ransomware
    attack was launched against San Francisco''s light rail system. No firewalls were
    overcome during the attack, although a worker did welcome the criminals into the
    facility by downloading a phishing email. Hacking a water company: The attackers
    gained access to the SCADA system of the water utility and used it to modify the
    quantity of chemicals utilised. They therefore got involved in the production
    and treatment of water [13]. Smart Building Attack: The main IoT applications
    involve smart homes and buildings. IoT devices are used to create the apps, which
    are constantly connected to the Internet. Two buildings'' heating and hot water
    services were switched off by the DDoS attack in the winter. The structure control
    system was inundated by fake Internet traffic as a result of the DoS assault.
    As a result, this prevented administrators from remotely controlling the device
    and caused the system to reset every few minutes [14]. Cyberattack on the power
    grid: In the UK, an electricity distribution network was attacked on the day of
    the general election. The SCADA system was targeted in the cyberattack in order
    to bring down the electrical grid. Senior personnel were the target of the attack,
    which was carried out via some phoney emails. The emails used social engineering
    strategies to get recipients to click on a phoney link that would launch malware.
    This attack used spear phishing, a more sophisticated kind of phishing. Fig. 4.
    User-oriented Attack Show All Fig. 5. Cyber Attacks Show All Fig. 6. Cyber Attack
    Process Show All Petrochemical Facility Cyberattack: An unsuccessful cyberattack
    was launched against a petrochemical facility. The facility''s operations were
    to be undermined, and an explosion with the potential to kill people was to be
    caused. Fortunately, a flaw in the attackers'' source code prevented the explosion
    from happening. In other sense, the attackers'' source code error was the only
    explanation it didn''t happen. Furthermore, the original data was not discovered
    in a previous cyberattack. The Cellular hacking tools were all created from scratch.
    Transportation Network Cyberattack: The cyberattack affected the transportation
    network, causing disruptions to travel services and delays on trains. Reservations
    couldn''t be made, and customers couldn''t get updates on the delays. Healthcare
    Business Cyberattack: A highly skilled attack was launched on a healthcare organisation.
    First, the attackers stole login credentials from a supplier of IT equipment to
    the hospital. Second, they used SamSam ransomware and remote execution methods
    to attack a server. The vital data files for the hospital were then encrypted
    [15]. Financial and Telecommunications Sectors Cyberattack: A planned attack was
    launched against well-known organisations that offer financial and communication
    infrastructure. The attack''s goal was to deny essential infrastructures services.
    For a while, the assaulted institutions were unable to function. Through IoT-based
    applications, critical infrastructures offer more effective performance and communication
    [16]. However, this might create security gaps and increase the frequency of cyberattacks
    on vital infrastructure. The most significant IoT-based cyberattacks are highlighted
    in this study. It''s critical to assess the impact and outcomes of the aforementioned
    situations in order to comprehend the seriousness of the situation. The entirety
    of these incidents highlight the weaknesses in key infrastructure systems in this
    environment [17]. These flaws frequently result from unsecure configurations in
    IoT-based control systems. This article lists the aforementioned cyberattacks
    in accordance with the year, place, target, definition, and damage. Reference
    could be checked for additional cyber-attacks on vital infrastructure [18]. SECTION
    V. Conclusion According to the study''s findings, artificial intelligence is rapidly
    becoming into a vital tool for increasing the effectiveness of security professionals.
    Machine intelligence provides the critical analyses and cyber threat that security
    teams may use to lower the likelihood of a breach and improve their company''s
    security posture as humans are no longer able to properly secure an enterprise-level
    attack surface. Machine learning will become more influential in our lives as
    more material is integrated into our regular activities. Artificial intelligence,
    according to some experts, would stifle innovation while greatly enhancing our
    quality of life, according to others. The capacity of cloud computing to assess
    and control hazards more quickly is one of its major benefits for cybersecurity.
    Many individuals are quite concerned about hackers'' ability to launch highly
    sophisticated technology and cyberattacks. The early detection of cyberattacks,
    hazard assessment and categorization, and crisis response planning may all benefit
    from the use of artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence will therefore
    advance cybersecurity and help firms create a stronger security posture, notwithstanding
    any potential risks. Authors Figures References Keywords Metrics More Like This

  description: Most of the water resource management systems are not migrated to cyber
    physical systems which make control mechanisms implemented insecure. Intruders
    target sustainable environmental systems focused on environmental disaster. User
    identification in modern structures no longer ensures right identity authentication
    and authorisation to digital control system, if the control system is misbehaved
    by the intruder and then it causes extreme damage to the environment. Even though
    current water resource management systems have implemented legacy digital control
    mechanism they have a higher chance of getting compromised through malicious activities.
    The framework proposed in this work involves multilayer authentication of user.
    The first gateway of our architecture uses a cryptographic salting technique,
    where in a random data is used as an additional input to a one way function that
    hashes data, a password or passphrase. Salts are used to safeguard passwords in
    storage. The second gateway imposes an algorithm that uses GPS which has the potential
    to help cyber security professionals to better detect and prevent cyber-attacks
    in real time. The third gateway uses image recognition on android mobile phones,
    from which security system is enhanced detecting image of the user, followed by
    a pattern.

    The growing scarcity of freshwater is one of the main challenges to food security
    and sustainability, where agriculture annually consumes the most water [1]. For
    this purpose, precision agriculture (PA) has achieved significant progress in
    water management and crop production using technological advances in software
    and hardware [2]. Precision irrigation (PI) is the sustainable management of water
    resources, which involves the application of water to the crop to meet specific
    plant water demands in space and time, while avoiding excessive or insufficient
    irrigation and minimizing adverse environmental impacts [3]. In PA, the Variable
    Rate Application (VRA) is the assignment of agricultural inputs in a site-specific
    manner. The correct application of the variable rate needs the specific plant
    requirements, the precise position and the characteristics of the environment
    where the input will be applied. There are two strategies for VRA: Map-based and
    sensor-based. In Map-Based VRA, the prescription map is generated and loaded into
    a computer inside the machinery before it performs its activities on the field
    [4]. Sensor-Based VRA is the technology that integrates sensors for automatically
    detecting the value of specific parameters in the plants or the soil in real-time
    and for deciding which kind and quantity of agricultural input should be applied
    [5]. VRA technologies apply water, fertilizer, herbicide and other chemicals for
    weeds and disease control and seed selection in sowing [6]. The purpose of those
    technologies is to save water, fertilizers and chemicals, increase potential yields
    and the protection of the environment [7]. The variable rate irrigation (VRI)
    technology provides the ability to site-specifically apply water in the field
    to achieve potential water savings [8]; this enables the incorporation of water
    in the soil according to the temporal and spatial soil characteristics and plant
    demand at different growth stages [9]. The VRI technology aims to apply the right
    amount of water at the right time, in the right place of the field, reducing water
    waste and improving water use efficiency (WUE), which is the ratio between biomass
    produced to the rate of transpiration [10], [6]. The effectiveness of VRI depends
    on the delineation of management zones, irrigation infrastructure, crop type,
    weather conditions and field properties such as topography, soil texture and soil
    water retention curves; that influence soil water content and crop irrigation
    prescriptions [11]. Therefore, understanding these factors can provide a basis
    to achieve improvements in crop water productivity and the environment [12]. In
    VRI, water requirements are applied at different rates to appropriately match
    field variability using individual management zones and their real needs instead
    of a homogeneous input application on the field [13]. A management zone is a field
    area with similar attributes in soil and topography. According to the definition
    of management zones, several parameters are considered as crop and soil properties,
    sensor-based information, field attributes, management practices and yield maps
    [14]. The information about irrigation prescriptions in the management zones is
    linked with automatic site-specific irrigation systems using dynamic prescription
    maps [15]. However, these maps can be challenging because the spatiotemporal variations
    on a field are affected by biotic factors such as plant diseases and pest infestation,
    and abiotic factors such as water stress, cold, drought, soil and water salinity
    [16]. The development process for an irrigation prescription map aims to fill
    the spatially variable soil–water profile and use software available with VRI
    hardware, yield, elevation or electrical conductivity maps through precision agriculture
    software or soil–water balance approaches from satellite imagery or wireless sensor
    networks [17]. Additionally, these maps use soil water measurements, soil water
    balance calculations or plant stress-based methods for defining irrigation amounts
    and timing. Volumetric water content (VWC) sensors, soil water profile measurements
    by a neutron probe and soil matric potential (SMP) sensors are the most used technologies
    for irrigation scheduling based on soil water measurements [18]. The magnitude
    of soil water content (SWC) varies with time and location, but the pattern of
    spatial variability usually remains similar [19]. Scheduling using soil water
    balance allows estimating soil–water depletion with good performance through the
    reference evapotranspiration multiplied by the corresponding crop coefficient
    [20]. In addition, process-based and statistical/machine-learning models can determine
    irrigation amounts using soil water balance [21]. These models consider factors
    like data availability, scalability, quantification of plant water stress, model
    uncertainties and constraints, and participation and motivation of producers [22].
    Some plant-based irrigation scheduling strategies use dendrometers [23], sap flow
    sensors [24] or canopy temperature measurements [25], among others. Canopy temperature
    is used for irrigation management because it indirectly indicates plant water
    stress through canopy energy balance. Water stress arises when the quantity of
    water in plant leaves restricts photosynthesis and respiration. In water-stressed
    conditions, transpiration decreases, causing more energy to be converted to sensible
    heat at the canopy surface compared to non-water-stressed conditions. It causes
    plant canopy temperatures to rise above what would occur without water shortages
    [22]. Remote and proximal sensing technologies such as infrared sensors (IRT)
    and near-infrared and thermal imaging measure canopy temperatures. With canopy
    temperature and weather data, it is possible to provide information about environmental,
    soil and crop conditions for VRI and the development of dynamic irrigation prescription
    maps [26]. Canopy temperature can be measured using radiometers filtered to the
    thermal infrared wavelengths , making them non-contact infrared thermometers.
    These devices can measure an area ranging from a few to several according to the
    platform, typically categorized as ground-based, aircraft, or satellite. Ground-based
    platforms can be stationary or moving, with sensors handheld, portable, or on
    moving machinery like center pivots. Moving platforms offer more spatial coverage
    with fewer sensors but trade-off frequency, usually measuring at a single time
    of day at many locations, while stationary devices provide continuous measurements
    at one field location [27]. Satellite remote sensing includes constraints associated
    with the spatial and temporal resolution and the cost and durability of sensors
    and associated components required for wireless data transmission. The Unmanned
    Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) offer several advantages for canopy temperature measurements,
    including a spatial resolution of several meters, a repeat frequency of no more
    than a few days, and a short interval from field measurement to data availability,
    typically just a few minutes. These advantages complement the essential requirements
    of reasonable instrument cost, precision, accuracy, and the ability to cover a
    significant field area. However, regulatory barriers exist for flying UAVs in
    certain regions [28]. Questions have arisen regarding the economic viability of
    utilizing UAV platforms for thermal imaging due to the cost and the extensive
    post-processing needed to generate reliably accurate thermometric images of a
    field [29]. Ground-based sensors, such as canopy temperature measured by stationary
    IRTs offer advantages over satellite and aircraft thermal imagers for agricultural
    use, including simplicity, lower cost, lower power consumption, and, most importantly,
    higher accuracy [30]. Achieving adequate field coverage needs a relatively large
    number of sensors, which would depend on factors such as field slope, soil variability,
    crop profitability, and sensor cost. The main types of algorithms used in irrigation
    management with IRTs are water stress indices and time–temperature thresholds
    (TTT) [27]. The crop water stress index (CWSI) and integrated CWSI (iCWSI) provide
    irrigation trigger information through the cooling effect due to plant transpiration
    based on the normalized function of vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and temperature
    difference between canopy and air [22]. The biologically identified optimal temperature
    interactive console (BIOTIC, [31]) is the fundamental principle for the definition
    of the TTT. The crop canopy temperature is measured using IRT sensors and compared
    with a crop-specific temperature threshold value [32]. The daily total amount
    is increased by one minute for each minute that the canopy temperature is higher
    than the temperature threshold. If this total daily value exceeds the time threshold
    at the end of the day, an irrigation amount is scheduled for the next day, corresponding
    to the daily crop evapotranspiration [36]. Other constraints are established for
    the addition of minutes to the daily total value in the TTT calculations, the
    net radiation must be greater than [33] and minutes are not added if the wet-bulb
    temperature is greater than the threshold temperature minus , because relative
    humidity can limit cooling by evaporation. [34] found equation (1), to determine
    the wet-bulb temperature using relative humidity and air temperature values. (1)
    The TTT plant stress-based method is easily automated in the field, installing
    IRT sensors in fixed locations. When sensors are not stationary, canopy temperatures
    are modelled according to sensors in a reference location using equation (2) [35].
    (2) where is the calculated canopy temperature at the remote location (°C)and
    is the predawn canopy temperature (°C). is the canopy temperature at the remote
    location on the center pivot, at any daylight time measured by the IRT sensor
    (°C) and is the reference canopy temperature at the same interval as (°C), is
    the measured reference temperature at the same time as when the remote temperature
    measurement was taken (°C). For adjusting canopy temperature values, [36] advise
    to use an adjusted equation for temperatures detected by the IRT sensor ( ) using
    the sensor body temperature ( ) as in equation (3). (3) The CWSI uses the variation
    in canopy temperature as a function of water deficits and meteorological conditions
    [18]. It relates the difference in the crop canopy temperature measured using
    IRT sensors to the air temperature as a function of relative humidity [37]. The
    water stress index uses this temperature difference according to an upper and
    lower temperature baseline. Under the same prevailing environmental conditions,
    the upper and lower baseline temperatures determine the non-transpiring and fully
    transpiring crop temperatures [38]. The CWSI is a dimensionless value in a range
    between 0 and 1. A well-watered crop corresponds to 0, and a severely water-stressed
    cultivation corresponds to 1 [37]. The concept was extended to moving IRTs aboard
    center pivots, resulting in crop yield and water use efficiency comparable to
    or greater than manual irrigation scheduling using soil water profile measurements
    with a neutron probe [39]. Several studies have focused on developing ground-based
    remote sensing systems for center pivots, including algorithms [40], wireless
    sensor networks [27], low-cost wireless IRT networks [41], and software to generate
    site-specific prescription maps based on weather, plant, and soil water information,
    with a graphical user interface (GUI) and geographic information system (GIS)
    tools, enabling site-specific irrigation scheduling for variable-rate irrigation
    (VRI) center pivot systems [42], [43]. Irrigation scheduling methods based on
    IRT sensors have been applied to corn [44], grain sorghum [45], soybean [25],
    hibiscus potted plants [46], apple trees [47], [48], Indian mustard [49] and cotton
    [50] crops. In [28], IRT sensors were implemented in a center-pivot irrigation
    system to calculate crop evapotranspiration (ETc). These sensors use a two-source
    energy balance (TSEB) model and provide a reduction of errors in ETc and crop
    water stress calculations by partitioning surface temperature into soil and canopy
    components. [51] applied the TTT method to a center-pivot irrigation system with
    infrared thermocouples and a global positioning system mounted on the center pivot
    for a soybean crop. Irrigation prescriptions were defined with the data analysis
    after midnight to determine the next-day strategy. Irrigation was applied in only
    one direction using special nozzles. The sensors corrected the canopy temperatures
    on the center pivot using soil IRT sensors obtaining the correction equation (4).
    (4) [50] used canopy temperature sensors on the center pivot for obtaining the
    Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI) by equation (5). (5) where is the crop temperature,
    is the average temperature of a wet reference and is obtained adding to the maximum
    dry bulb temperature recorded for the specific field day. [15] demonstrated the
    advantage of IRT sensors mounted on a center pivot with a global positioning system
    to provide spatial and temporal crop water status at the field scale. While most
    precision irrigation technology is too expensive and complex for average farmers,
    methods involving IRTs may become more appealing due to their lower costs and
    simplicity. This technology has the potential to simplify management while increasing
    yields and reducing water-related waste, making it an attractive option for producers
    [35]. IRTs on center pivots and irrigation scheduling algorithms have resulted
    in crop yields and water productivity equal to or greater than those achieved
    with soil water measurements and a field-calibrated neutron probe. Combining stationary
    IRT measurements with moving IRT arrays enhances the effectiveness of irrigation
    scheduling algorithms. Stationary measurements offer time series data while moving
    arrays provide spatially distributed data [52], [30]. Wireless data transmission
    is now accessible for IRTs, eliminating the need for cumbersome wiring and enhancing
    the ease of deploying IRTs in various settings [53], [54]. Furthermore, researchers
    use extensive datasets with canopy temperature and corresponding weather information.
    These datasets, in conjunction with machine learning, artificial neural networks
    and deep learning techniques, are being employed alongside energy balance models
    to estimate thermal stress indices and facilitate irrigation scheduling [55],
    [56]. Employing infrared thermocouples (IRTCs) on self-propelled irrigation systems
    such as center pivots present several challenges: - Estimating daily canopy temperature
    dynamics from a single measurement at each field location is challenging due to
    the uncertainty associated with the timing of these measurements [35]. - It requires
    automatic data collection and analysis to control the irrigation system based
    on the canopy temperature data [35]. - If a self-propelled irrigation system is
    in motion, it has made an irrigation decision based on prescription maps unless
    it acquires data moving without irrigating [35]. - The misalignment of the IRTCs
    over the rows occurs as the pivot moves around the field [35]. - The time–temperature
    threshold (TTT) and crop water stress indexes are canopy temperature-based algorithms
    that do not distinguish between soil and canopy temperature. This lack of distinction,
    even though differences can exceed 30 °C, can affect the apparent surface temperature,
    particularly during partial canopy cover. Consequently, instances of unnecessary
    irrigation events occurring early in the season, before full canopy cover, have
    been reported [45], [28]. - Concerns have arisen that the deflection of moving
    irrigation systems and other factors may degrade moving IRT measurements relative
    to stationary IRT measurements [30]. - Specialized hardware and software systems
    exist for defining irrigation prescription maps based on weather, plant, and soil
    water information. This software incorporates site-specific irrigation scheduling
    methods and automates the data collection and processing obtained from sensing
    systems. However, it only defines static irrigation prescription maps and does
    not facilitate real-time water application in the field [43]. - Calculation methods
    typically employ the empirical upper and lower limits of the temperature difference
    between canopy and air to estimate CWSI and iCWSI based on the standardized temperature
    difference. This approach introduces irreducible uncertainty and error [22]. -
    Existing precision irrigation tools often have inadequate user interfaces, making
    them difficult to use and resulting in a poor user experience [57]. Additionally,
    low accuracy characterizes these tools, leading to the reluctance of producers
    to adopt them [58]. - Most current precision irrigation decision-support systems
    assume that producers strictly adhere to the recommended irrigation decisions
    for each event without allowing any flexibility in the irrigation timing [22].
    - The increasing adoption of infrared thermometers (IRT) for crop irrigation management
    has contributed to the growth of surface temperature datasets. This trend emphasizes
    the need to develop data quality assurance and control (QA/QC) procedures like
    those used for agricultural weather station data [53]. - In-situ sensors currently
    available in markets are typically expensive or not cost-effective enough for
    widespread adoption. Furthermore, they often require installation and removal
    before and after the growing season for row crops, resulting in additional labor
    costs [59], [22]. According to the references consulted, there is a wide range
    of research opportunities and challenges in the commercial implementation of this
    technology. Further studies are needed to determine how to integrate the information
    acquired from IRT sensors and automatic irrigation application systems to prescribe
    and apply the site-specific irrigation needs in real-time during the growing season,
    using soil and crop characteristics under different environments [15], [6]. Currently,
    systems acquire data from the field and generate irrigation prescription maps
    before the irrigation procedure (static maps). This study aims to develop an innovative
    system for mapping real-time canopy temperature and defining prescriptions using
    IRT sensors on a center pivot and GPS data while the center pivot moves on the
    field. The proposed system consists of hardware and software developments whose
    final goal is to provide farm managers with accurate and frequently updated information
    about crop irrigation requirements. This paper shows only the real-time canopy
    temperature system. The prescription mechanism and the proposed system comparison
    with others will be reported in other publications. 2. Materials and methods The
    study was conducted from the Farm Services Unit of E.V. Smith Research Center
    in Shorter, Auburn University, Alabama, USA (32° 26′ 15″ N, 85° 54′ 57″ W, and
    32 masl), during the 2018 and 2019 growing seasons. The field experiences a subtropical
    humid (Cfa) climate, with average low and high temperatures of and , respectively,
    and an annual rainfall of (https://awis.aumesonet.com/). The same corn hybrid
    (Dekalb DKC62-08, Bayer Corp., Whippany, N.J.) was planted in both years. In 2018,
    the corn was planted in concentric rows, while in 2019, it was planted in straight
    rows at a row spacing of and a population density of [60]. Soil texture, bulk
    density, and soil water retention curves (SWRC) were determined at five points
    within the experimental area. These properties were measured at soil depths of
    , , and at each location. The percentage by mass of sand, clay, and silt was determined
    by a commercial soil laboratory (Water Agricultural Laboratories, Camilla, Ga.).
    Saturated undisturbed soil cores were analyzed using a hydraulic property analyzer
    (HYPROP 2, Meter Group, Pullman, Wash.) to establish the relationship between
    soil matric potential and volumetric soil water content (VWC) [61]. The soil matric
    potential of saturated undisturbed cores, measured with the hydraulic property
    analyzer, ranged from 0 to 0.08 MPa. Additionally, a dew point hygrometer (WP4C
    PotentiaMeter, Meter Group) was employed to determine the VWC versus soil matric
    potential relationship at 0.63, 1.5, and 3.3 MPa using disturbed soil samples.
    The data from both instruments were processed using HYPROP-FIT software (ver.
    4.1.0.0, Meter Group, https://library.metergroup.com/Manuals/UMS/HYPROP-FIT_Manual.pdf)
    to generate soil water retention curves (SWRCs) based on the traditional unconstrained
    van Genuchten model [62]. The volumetric soil water content (VWC) at field capacity
    (FC) was determined for all locations, while the permanent wilting point (PWP)
    was established at a soil matric potential of 1.5 MPa. Soil bulk density was calculated
    by dividing the weight of dry soil (oven-dried at 105 °C until reaching a constant
    weight) by its volume, using undisturbed soil cores. The experiment took place
    in a field irrigated by a seven-span, half-circle center pivot irrigation system
    covering 30 ha. The system (model 7000, Valmont Industries, Valley, Neb.) had
    a lateral length of 434 m and operated with a flow rate of 181.7 cubic meters
    per hour, with a line pressure at the pivot point of 0.241 MPa. Equipped with
    a middle-elevation spray application (MESA) sprinkler package, the system included
    pressure regulators rated at 0.103 MPa. It was retrofitted with a variable-rate
    irrigation (VRI) system featuring solenoid valves to control water application
    over each half span. Each half span, approximately 31 m in length, represented
    a grid of 2° arc, allowing for the prescription of a single irrigation rate for
    the group of sprinklers within each half span. The experiment utilized full and
    limited irrigation treatments, designated as T100 (100 % soil water replenishment
    to field capacity), T66 (66 % replenishment of T100), and T33 (33 % replenishment
    of T100). A randomized complete block design was implemented with three treatments
    and four replications in 2018 (12 plots) and six replications in 2019 (18 plots).
    Soil water content (VWC) in the root zone was measured using a time domain reflectometer
    (TDR-315L, Acclima, Meridian, Ida.) and a capacitance-type soil water sensor (ECH2O
    EC-5, Meter Group) at three depths. In 2018, sensors were installed from 21 May
    to 30 August, while in 2019, they were installed from 23 April to 5 August. For
    the T100 treatments, VWC changes (except for replication 1 in 2018) were monitored
    using TDR-315L and EC-5 sensors at 0.15, 0.3, and 0.6 m soil depths. The T66 and
    T33 treatments were assessed using only EC-5 sensors at the same soil depths as
    the T100 treatments. Dataloggers (Aquatrac, AgSense, Valmont Industries, Inc.,
    Huron, S.D., and model Em50, Meter Group) recorded VWC values at 30-minute intervals.
    Aquatrac dataloggers were used for TDR-315L sensors, while Em50 dataloggers were
    used for EC-5 sensors. Data collection began on 21 May 2018 and 28 April 2019.
    Irrigation rates were determined using VWC data from TDR-315L sensors in the T100
    treatment to replenish soil water to field capacity (FC) at a depth of 0.6 m.
    When soil water depletion from any T100 treatment reached 50 % of plant-available
    water (PAW), irrigation was applied to all treatments. The irrigation rate for
    each block was calculated based on the T100 treatment. For T66 and T33 treatments,
    irrigation rates were 66 % and 33 % of the T100 rate, respectively. Soil water
    depletion (SWD) was calculated by summing the depletion at each soil layer using
    data from four TDR-315L sensors in 2018 and three TDR-315L sensors in 2019. The
    irrigation prescription map was generated using Valley VRI (model 8.55, Valmont
    Industries, Valley, Neb.) and uploaded remotely to the Valley Pro2 panel located
    at the pivot point. Canopy temperature data were recorded using wireless IRT sensors
    (SapIP-IRT, Dynamax, Houston, Tex.) installed on a stationary mast in each experimental
    plot. IRT data collection began on May 13, 2018, and May 7, 2019, corresponding
    to the V7 vegetative growth stage. IRTs were installed 1 m above the canopy in
    the same crop row and 1.5 m from soil water sensors. Each IRT sensor targets the
    crop row throughout the growing season. Additionally, twelve IRT sensors (SapIP-IRT,
    Dynamax, Houston, Tex.) were installed on span 2 in 2018 and on span 7 in 2019,
    collecting data while the center pivot was moving. Dynamax IRT sensors were calibrated
    by the company before the experiments. IRT location accuracy was determined using
    a real-time kinematic (RTK) 297 Trimble GPS (Trimble Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA).
    The design principle follows the concept of a wireless sensor network (WSN) [63].
    The system has a set of IRT sensors installed on a center pivot, a global positioning
    system node (GPS), which communicates with a central or main station using a Zigbee
    protocol (IEEE 802.15.4). The central station uses an embedded computer (EC).
    The CE is responsible for data acquisition from the IRT sensors and performing
    water stress indices, storing the information in a database, configuring the capture
    modules, and interacting with the user through a graphic user interface (GUI).
    Irrigation prescriptions with IRT sensors measurements on the center pivot were
    modeled using the machine learning models NARX (Nonlinear Autoregressive Network
    with Exogenous Inputs) and LSTM (Long short-term memory), adjusting the best hyperparameters
    and using as inputs the air temperature and relative humidity, canopy temperature
    of sensors on stationary masts, canopy temperature of sensors installed aboard
    the central pivot and as output the corresponding irrigation prescription. This
    procedure is not the scope of this article, and details will be explained in forthcoming
    publications. The proposed system design for canopy temperature monitoring and
    water balance estimation in a center pivot involves hardware and software integration
    and communication components. This section describes the electronic devices required
    to satisfy the requirements defined in the research. First, the hardware for the
    IRT system, the GPS system and the embedded computer are presented, with a justification
    of their suitability and an exposition of their main features. Then, is discussed
    the methodological aspects of the software development process. Finally, are introduced
    the underlying mapping algorithms of canopy temperature. 2.1. Hardware components
    description Wireless sensor node architecture includes twelve SapIP-IRT Infrared
    Leaf Temperature (Dynamax, Inc., Houston, TX), equipped with an XBee RF module
    (Digi International, Minnetonka, Minn.). The SapIP-IRT has a highly accurate reading
    of , is very stable over time, and has a signal window and field of view (FOV).
    For a one-meter-wide target, the IRT must place three meters above the item or
    surface to measure (20 degrees FOV). Zigbee specifications are and a range of
    with a omnidirectional antenna - (high gain), rechargeable batteries, typical

    sensors, GPS receiver and server in the center pivot. The wireless GPS node in
    the center pivot end-tower uses a raspberry pi zero board, a solar panel, a 12
    V battery and a Garmin GLO GPS. GLO can receive position information from the
    GPS and the GLONASS satellite constellations, allowing it to connect to up to
    24 more satellites than devices that rely on GPS alone. The GLO GPS locks on satellites
    approximately 20 percent faster and remain connected even at high speed. GLO updates
    its position information ten times per second with WAAS, an accuracy of 3 m and
    12 h of battery life. The 12 IRT sensors mounted onto the center pivot acquire
    crop canopy temperature. Sensors and GPS node transmit temperature and geolocation
    data to the central station, that is, a small computer Raspberry Pi3 (Raspberry-Pi®
    Foundation North America, Inc) at the pivot point with Zigbee 2.4 GHz protocol
    and an algorithm developed in the Python programming platform (Python Software
    Foundation, version 3, Netherlands) for managing and visualizing data, and defining
    irrigation prescription. 2.2. Software development process According to [50],
    for an IRT sensor located on the pivot, the cover surface can be approximated
    as an elliptical footprint with the vertical axis (Fig. 2). The equation used
    to calculate the area and characteristics of that elliptical footprint was defined
    using Fig. 3. This figure shows the geometrical dimensions of the cover surface
    pattern. The parameters defined are : horizontal distance from the pivot lateral
    to the ellipse starting point, : horizontal distance from the pivot lateral to
    the point with the highest temperature value acquired by the IRT sensor, horizontal
    distance from the pivot lateral to the ellipse center and : the horizontal distance
    from the pivot lateral to the ellipse endpoint. , and represent the optical path
    length from the IRT sensor to , and , respectively. is the angle between the vertical

    Consequently, from equation (11) is obtained equation (17). (17) Finally, the
    ellipse area calculation is determined using equation (18). (18) Using equation
    (18), for example, an IRT looking slightly forward of the drop hoses at an oblique
    angle to the of FOV, mounted on a pivot lateral ( above the ground), (in the horizontal
    plane) from the edge of a treatment plot, will have a resolution of approximately
    of crop surface and with FOV approximately of crop surface. Fig. 4 specifies the

    with an accuracy of 1–100 cm using Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) in
    the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84). These coordinates where stored in three
    variables: , and These locations were converted to Universal Transverse Mercator
    (UTM) coordinates: , and Distances (from to ) and (from to ) were defined using
    the UTM coordinates, equations (19), (20). (19) (20) To calculate the distance
    between IRT sensors ( ), is divided by the number of sensors plus one. In this
    experiment, there were 12 sensors on the pivot, then . A list of sensor locations
    on the pivot , is generated by with . This list contains 12 values, equation (21).
    (21) Each Dynamax IRT sensor sends a frame with a time tick, sensor serial number,
    battery voltage, target IR temperature degrees Celsius resolution), and sensor
    body temperature. For example, the frame: corresponds to sensor 305, reading of
    canopy temperature. The algorithm uses a list of IRT serial numbers with codes
    of the 12 sensors installed on the pivot. This list contains 12 strings, equation
    (22). (22) Additionally, the code uses a dictionary with 12 key-value pairs. The
    keys correspond to the 12 serial numbers and a list of values acquired by 12 IRT
    sensors. The dictionary uses the notation tuples of Key (String): Values (List
    of float numbers), equation (23). S (23). The GPS distance concerning the pivot
    lateral is a constant defined by equation (24). (24) The angle between the pivot
    lateral and the GPS location is a constant defined by equation (25). (25) The
    algorithm to define the location of each sensor on the field in real-time uses
    the following steps: • Acquire data from and convert it to . • Define in Fig.
    3 using the equation (26). (26) • Adding with to define the pivot lateral angle
    . For determining the geographical position of each sensor, the algorithm uses
    a new dynamic center point . This location changes during the pivot movement,
    adding −90 degrees to the center pivot angle according to Fig. 4. 3. Results and

    Mapping Tool supports the system configuration (sensors, GPS node data acquisition
    and other parameters), data processing and map visualization. The design principles
    for the Infrared Mapping Tool in real-time were that it should provide the most
    accurate and site-specific information we could offer the irrigation manager with
    the selected technology. In addition, the Infrared Mapping Tool requires minimum
    user input, is very easy to manage and provides ready-to-use data output to irrigation
    prescriptions in real-time. The Infrared Mapping Tool can operate with Raspbian
    or Windows operative systems. This tool records data in plain text format (.txt)
    inside its memory block and in an external pen drive and generates a shape file
    with the information in real-time from the sensors and their locations. The system
    uses a VNC (Virtual Network Computing) connection for monitoring remotely using
    WIFI communication protocols, and data is sent to a server for processing after
    the acquisition if there is an internet connection. The central station uses a
    Raspberry Pi with a 3.2 in. touch screen. After the initial setup, the user interacts
    with the Main Screen (Fig. 7). If the system configuration does not need modifications,

    significant because they are stored and used to locate the IRT sensors on the
    center pivot and to ensure the dynamic location precision of each sensor when
    it is in movement. The Center Pivot Span Configuration tab allows the user to

    role in achieving the sustainability of food production and ensuring regional
    water security [64]. Producers rely on personal experience and weather data to
    determine when and how much to irrigate using center pivot systems. A survey found
    that over 75 % of U.S. irrigation scheduling methods rely on rules of thumb like
    crop calendars and neighbor practices, while less than 25 % use science or technology-based
    approaches [65]. According to the recent advances, challenges and opportunities
    of precision irrigation described by [22], the most important topics are data
    availability and scalability, quantification of plant water stress, model uncertainties
    and constraints, and the participation of producers and motivation. Table 2 shows
    the challenges and contributions of the proposed system in this research. Table

    The developed system significantly enhances precision irrigation practices by
    enabling real-time water application according to crop water demand. This information
    allows for optimal irrigation precise determination timing and amounts across
    the field. Unlike conventional infrared thermography (IRT) sensor systems on center
    pivots, which generate static water need maps [42], [43], our system offers dynamic,
    real-time irrigation prescriptions with application in dynamic variable-rate technologies
    that adjust irrigation rates based on the changing conditions within the field.
    These prescriptions are vital because they consider the spatial and temporal variations
    in crop growth, crop water status, and soil water availability throughout the
    growing season. This capability represents a significant advancement in precision
    irrigation technology. The adoption of precision irrigation tools depends on their
    accuracy and user-friendly interfaces [57]. Our system provides an intuitive interface
    and dynamic decision-making, empowering farmers with the capability to make informed
    decisions about when to start or stop irrigation. Swift updates based on soil
    and plant conditions are crucial if irrigation is postponed [22], and real-time
    mapping eliminates the need for acquiring new data for the entire field and generating
    new prescription maps. Additional calibrations beyond the manufacturer''s factory
    settings were not applied to Dynamax IRT sensors (Dynamax, Inc., Houston, TX).
    A study conducted in a controlled temperature chamber showed that root mean squared
    errors between factory-calibrated IRT brightness and black-body temperatures (ranging
    from 15 °C to 55 °C) were mostly within 0.75 °C, while ambient temperatures in
    the chamber were varied from 15 °C to 45 °C. However, the temperature differences
    between the target and ambient temperatures in the controlled chamber (up to 40
    °C) were much larger than those typically encountered in field conditions (10)°C).
    Field testing using a lysimeter indicated that post-factory calibration versus
    factory calibration had minimal impact on calculated crop evapotranspiration [66].
    This suggests that an additional post-factory, sensor-specific calibration would
    have little justification over using only factory-calibrated temperatures in the
    field. Moreover, conducting a post-factory calibration over a range of ambient
    and target temperatures would necessitate a blackbody surface and chamber with
    variable temperature control, equipment that is rarely available [53]. Therefore,
    IRT data that solely rely on factory calibration are more likely to be suitable
    for practical applications in this project. The ZigBee Remote Control protocol
    offers several significant advantages over other systems. It provides low-power
    transmission, robustness, high security, and high scalability, with the ability
    to support high node density. Additionally, it leverages wireless control and
    sensor networks in IoT applications [67]. In wireless communication systems deployed
    in agricultural fields, security and privacy are crucial to ensure data confidentiality.
    Zigbee addresses these concerns by employing the 128-bit advanced encryption standard
    (AES) [68]. The AES algorithm encrypts the data and verifies data integrity using
    a message authentication code generated by encrypting the IEEE MAC frame. Xbee
    modules use the AES-CTR mode for encrypting the payload. Compared to IEEE 802.15.4,
    Zigbee adds two extra security layers to the network and application layers, utilizing
    AES 128-bit encryption. The distributed security model is limited to routers and
    end devices. If a router detects a powered-up existing network, it can join the
    secured network; otherwise, it can form a distributed secured network and assign
    network keys to newly joined routers and end devices. While this model is simple,
    it does not offer the highest level of security. We use the centralized security
    model, which is more complex and secure than the distributed model. The network
    coordinator is responsible for authenticating and validating each device attempting
    to join the network [69]. While these encryptions enhance security, they limit
    the delay in network communications (latency), the speed at which data is transmitted
    (throughput), link quality, power consumption and longevity of the network. However,
    the increased energy consumption for encryption is recommended in agricultural
    IoT applications [70]. Security measures implementation can significantly enhance
    the security of Zigbee networks. Nevertheless, like any technology, the effectiveness
    of security measures depends on how they are implemented and maintained [71].
    Without adequate security configurations, Xbee devices are vulnerable. These devices
    are built with a preconfigured global link key, making them susceptible to man-in-the-middle
    attacks. The equipment in IRT sensors and central station should be placed in
    protective enclosures to prevent damage from insects, rodents, and weather conditions.
    These enclosures must be both weatherproof and tamper-resistant. Environmental
    sealing can protect against moisture and dust, which can negatively impact the
    performance of electronic components. Adequate ventilation may also be necessary
    to prevent overheating. It is recommended to use reliable power sources, such
    as solar panels or batteries, to ensure the continuous operation of the electronic
    system. Backup power sources may be required in the event of power outages. Dynamax
    IRT sensors offer remote monitoring capabilities, enabling the tracking of the
    electronic system''s performance and the detection of any issues related to the
    power system. Regular inspection and maintenance of the electronic system are
    crucial to ensure optimal performance. This includes checking for signs of damage,
    cleaning components, and replacing worn-out parts. Preventive maintenance was
    conducted monthly, while general corrective maintenance and functional tests were
    performed whenever the sensors were installed on the central pivot, and the routers
    and central station were placed in the field. To prevent damage from rodents,
    all exposed cables near the soil were covered with flexible metal tubes. The scalability
    in the developed systems depends on the transceiver devices used in the wireless
    sensor network. ZigBee networks offer several benefits, particularly in large-scale
    deployments, due to their energy efficiency and flexibility. [72] refers to Zigbee
    networks as personal area networks (PANs) and states that each network has a unique
    PAN identifier (PAN ID) shared among all devices in the network. Zigbee devices
    can join a network by either being preconfigured with a PAN ID or by discovering
    nearby networks and selecting a PAN ID to join. Zigbee defines three device types:
    coordinator, router, and end-device [73]. In Zigbee networks, there should be
    only one Coordinator node per network, serving as the controller responsible for
    selecting the network channel, organizing the network, and synchronizing the wireless
    sensor network. The coordinator selects the channel, PAN ID, security policy,
    and stack profile for the network. It initiates the network, selects the channel
    and PAN ID (64-bit and 16-bit), and manages other functions that define, secure,
    and maintain the network. Routers are responsible for maintaining the infrastructure
    of the ZigBee network. These nodes do not gather data or start the message transmission
    but only transmit data from router to router or from the end devices to the coordinator.
    These devices cannot sleep and must always remain powered on. Finally, end-devices
    do not route. They are responsible for gathering data and delivering it to the
    nearby router or coordinator. The scalability of the proposed system in this paper
    does not have restrictions by communication infrastructure because designers have
    made all ZigBee nodes small, lightweight, and energy-efficient, allowing the connection
    of up to 65,535 nodes [74]. Dynamax utilizes the IRT SALH data logger system,
    housed in a weatherproof enclosure, which can link to repeaters to collect data
    from up to 25 wireless IRT sensors and three routers [75]. In this research, we
    designed and implemented a datalogger that allows the connection of more IRT sensors,
    integrating one coordinator, multiple end-devices and routers, leveraging the
    capabilities of ZigBee technology and improving system scalability. Table 3 lists
    the required hardware for implementing the wireless sensor, GPS, and central station
    nodes, along with their current costs. The number of wireless sensor nodes used
    depends on the central pivot size, and a span can accommodate several IRT sensors.
    Based on the current design and the study field characteristics, the cost of implementing
    the entire hardware in the center pivot with twelve SapIP-IRT Infrared Leaf Temperature
    (Dynamax, Inc., Houston, TX) nodes is US$8,964.32. We implemented this hardware
    to ensure the system performs correctly. One key focus of future work is reducing
    implementation costs and optimizing modules'' energy consumption. Table 3. Costs

    1461.11 According to the University of Georgia’s crop production budget [76],
    a center pivot irrigation system can consume diesel and electricity per every
    irrigated acre-inch (Table 4). These costs are strictly related to the center
    pivot movement when watering. Table 4. Cost analysis for center pivot installation:

    373.36 313.22 195.05 Reviewing the current procedure for canopy sensors on central
    pivot systems reveals the need to move the pivot across the field, acquire data
    along its path, generate irrigation prescription maps, and adjust pivot movement
    for irrigation based on these prescriptions [42], [43]. Additionally, any incidental
    rain or operational problems with the central pivot that render the system inoperable
    for hours or days render the initial prescription obsolete, necessitating new
    routes for new prescriptions. The system proposed in this research addresses these
    challenges. Moreover, by eliminating field steps required for generating irrigation
    maps, the operating costs of the center pivot are reduced respect to Table 4.
    It is important to note that the values presented in Table 4 do not include these
    data acquisition processes, which contribute to higher implementation and operation
    costs when using the conventional mapping method with IRT sensors on the center
    pivot. 4. Conclusions The proposed technology contributes to agricultural irrigation
    management through its cost-effective implementation and capabilities of mapping
    crop canopy temperatures using a wireless network of infrared thermometers on
    a center pivot. It incorporates Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) with scalability
    options, IoT capabilities, and web data availability. The technology enables precise
    plant water stress quantification based on canopy temperature and soil water content,
    facilitating real-time irrigation prescriptions while the center pivot is in motion
    on the field. Canopy temperature sensors do not require additional calibration,
    guaranteeing highly accurate readings of +/- 0.5 °C. Enhancing the GPS receiver
    accuracy is imperative because it guarantees the determination of the sensor''s
    position on the center pivot. GLO2 GPS can receive position information from GPS
    and GLONASS satellite constellations, can use 24 extra satellites to lock approximately
    20 % faster and remain connected even at high speed but with an accuracy of 3
    m. To enhance the GPS module, we can use receivers with Differential Global Positioning
    System (DGPS) as Real-time kinematic positioning (RTK) or augmentation systems
    such as Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) in U.S.A. or European Geostationary
    Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) in Europe. NARX and LSTM neural network models
    were trained to predict irrigation prescriptions using ambient temperature, relative
    humidity, and plant cover temperature as input data. These temperatures were measured
    by the sensors installed on the ground and aboard the central pivot. The irrigation
    prescription was used as output data. They achieved RMSE values ranging from 0.56
    mm to 4.18 mm in RMSE. Additionally, the correlation coefficient values exceeded
    0.8, indicating that the models effectively tracked the irrigation prescription
    behavior using canopy temperature sensors. Several research activities are proposed
    as future work. Exploring LoRaWAN technologies can enhance transmission distances,
    thus improving the efficiency and reach of sensor networks. Additionally, efforts
    to reduce the costs of sensors and data acquisition systems can continue, making
    these technologies more accessible to farmers. Another promising area is the development
    of algorithms for fusing data from ground, drone, and satellite sources, which
    could significantly enhance spatial resolution in irrigation management. Furthermore,
    research focusing on refining irrigation prescription models in diverse environments
    and improving irrigation amount calculations based on soil water demand and plant
    physiological regulations is essential. Finally, researchers must develop models
    that consider the effects of measurements in soil rows and crop plants. This research

    Citations Keywords Metrics Abstract: Most of the existing science and technology
    parks resort to various conventional ways to attract different stakeholders to
    the park. Some of these traditional measures include business support, workspaces,
    laboratories, networking events, accommodation, and essential commodities. Besides,
    with rampantly changing multidisciplinary technologies and increased data-oriented
    business models, the classic science and technology park value-creation strategies
    may not be instrumental in the near future. Hence, we foresee that future science
    and a technology parks should be fully integrated, sustainable, and innovative
    living science cities. Where park tenants can actively interact and contribute
    to emerging technologies. Therefore, this paper carries out an in-depth study
    of world’s best practices in smart cities and science and technology parks, their
    characteristics, and value-added contributions that excite the prospective tenants.
    Developing on the detailed survey, we propose a unique feature of “Autonomous
    Systems as a Service” to bestow a futuristic look to the science and technology
    parks. It is envisaged that autonomous systems will not only provide value-added
    services to the park tenants but will also provide an infrastructure for testing
    new technologies within park premises. Furthermore, this study evaluates security
    and privacy challenges associated with autonomous systems and data-oriented services
    and recommends appropriate security measures. The role of universities in the
    success of a science and technology park is also delineated. Finally, the components
    deemed essential for the attainment of science and technology parks’ objectives
    are highlighted. Adaptive Road Bump – One of the Components of Autonomous Systems

    a Science and Technology Park (STP) dates back to 1953 when the world’s first
    science park was opened at Stanford University, United States [1]. A science park
    is also termed as a technology park or a research park. The primary objective
    of Stanford’s technology park was to provide a pleasant environment for collaboration
    between various stakeholders such as startups, research and development (R&D)
    companies, venture capital firms, and Stanford University’s research brainpower.
    This technology park stimulated regional economic growth, thus transforming regional
    development policies. Similarly, other countries also followed, and in the 1960s
    and 70s, this phenomenon extended to England and Japan. In the 1980s, France,
    Germany, Sweden, Finland, Belgium, and some Southeast Asian countries also laid
    the foundations of such technological parks [2]. Correspondingly, Sydney Science
    Park (SSP) [3], [4] is a multi-billion-dollar greenfield development project that
    aspires to be a world-class facility clustering together leading innovators in
    the industry, education, and business. The vision for SSP is to be a fully integrated,
    innovation-based community that will include high-quality lifestyle opportunities.
    SSP aims to promote a culture of innovation, creativity, and entrepreneurship
    to benefit the whole region. However, there may be a question that why do we need
    STPs? It is proffered that the sharing of knowledge and resources is deemed essential
    to promote innovation and technological development. However, there are high communication
    costs associated with the transmission of knowledge to distance. Whereas technology
    parks and incubators support firms to transmit technical knowledge that is complex,
    uncertain, and in the noncodified form [5], [6]. Similarly, STPs and incubators
    fully articulate knowledge flows among the actors of a regional innovation system
    [7], [8]. If we look at the academic aspect of the science parks, the universities
    see the STPs and incubators as a means to conduct productive research and commercialize
    their technologies. The educational institutions also visualize an environment
    where they can improve corporate innovation capacity by converting academic knowledge
    and local R&D into commercial products or processes [9]. Hence, in the last decade
    or so, there has been an exponential rise in entrepreneurial activity at the universities,
    which has further stimulated activities such as patenting, licensing, research
    joint ventures with private companies, and the creation of spinoff companies.
    In this context, the universities resort to licensing for the commercialization
    of university-based Intellectual Property (IP). Correspondingly, universities
    are increasingly emphasizing the creation of new companies as a mechanism for
    commercialization [10]. Moreover, universities also facilitate technology diffusion
    by establishing technology transfer centers through the licensing of a university-based
    technology to an existing firm or a new venture [11]. Accordingly, there has been
    a rise of “Innovation Districts” in the world [12]. Innovation districts can be
    termed as a mash up of entrepreneurs and educational institutions, start-ups and
    schools, to foster mixed-use development and technological innovations. For example,
    David Johnston Research and Technology (R+T) Park [13], is Canada’s largest innovation
    district. This innovation district aims at creation of state-of-the-art (SoTA)
    technology by incubating and helping companies in innovation, harnessing appropriate
    talent, and entering into a world-class ecosystem of startups. The main attractions
    of R+T park include: 1) A strong collaboration with University of Waterloo that
    is known for prolific industry partnerships to solve real-world problems. 2) The
    co-location of R+T park and University of Waterloo gives the residents of research
    and technology park an edge to be closer to the one of the world’s best human
    resource in the form of over sixty thousand students. 3) Availability of an Accelerator
    Centre that offers comprehensive corporate innovation program to facilitate creation
    of spinoffs, develop out of the box solutions to customer problems, and fast validation
    of proposed solutions. However, the desired impact of a STP may vary as per the
    types of tenants it accommodates. For example, the needs of a startup may differ
    from that of an established firm, academic research institution, or a service
    provider [14]. Besides, with rapidly changing multidisciplinary technologies,
    an increase in data-oriented business models, and resulting concerns over users’
    privacy, the classic STP business models may not be very useful. Hence, it is
    envisioned that a STP should be a fully integrated, sustainable, innovative living
    science city. Where park tenants can actively interact and contribute to the future
    technologies with minimal impact to other citizens’ privacy. Accordingly, an ideal
    science park should create value for all types of tenants with a futuristic approach.
    Therefore, there is a need to derive new value-creation strategies for STPs by
    evaluating world’s best practices in technology parks and smart cities to attract
    tenants and promote technological innovation. Moreover, research is also required
    to explore new technologies that would give STPs a futuristic look. Subsequently,
    the proposed innovative systems should be carefully assessed to ensure the security
    and privacy of users’ data in a living science city environment. A. Related Work
    Existing literature on STPs is somewhat shallow, focusing on particular matters
    and therefore not comprehensive. For instance, researchers in [15] only evaluated
    the impact of science parks on local firms to validate policy effectiveness. Similarly,
    another study exclusively analyzed the economic impact of science parks [16].
    In the same way, [17] examined the contributions of science parks to multiple
    stakeholders considering various contingencies. On the other hand, authors in
    [18] reviewed the current state of knowledge on science park contributions and
    proposed ways to enhance this knowledge. Also, some studies either focused on
    the general aspects of science parks [19] or concentrated on business incubation
    mechanisms [20]. Likewise, [21] mapped businesses’ performance and their prospects
    of survival against contributions of STPs. Correspondingly, certain studies explored
    just a particular aspect of science parks such as entrepreneurship and incubators
    [22], effects of STP policies on the creation of spinoff firms [23], generalized
    benefits of parks and incubators [24], and the impact of science parks on different
    types of firms [8], [24]. Correspondingly, [25] proposed a performance management
    framework for science parks to demonstrate results and seek improvements. Similarly,
    [26], [27] analyzed the role of STPs in the United Kingdom (UK) in nurturing scientific
    activity and cooperation between various stakeholders. Likewise, [28] studied
    the effects of research centers and universities on organizations’ growth, innovativeness,
    and overall R&D investments in the science parks. Hence, there is a lack of literature
    that emphasizes the value-creation strategies in STPs. Moreover, given the scope
    of existing literature, authors in [29] proposed that more research be done on
    the development of science parks. To address this, we see an opportunity in the
    ideation and definition of SSP to visualize SSP as an autonomous living city.
    Hence, this paper is relevant to researchers, policymakers, and stakeholders interested
    in establishing, investing in or joining a STP to make value-added contributions
    or gain from state-of-the-art technological development. Resultantly, this study
    aims to provide a holistic view of a STP as an autonomous living city with a futuristic
    approach. The significant contributions of this research include: Presents a comprehensive
    review of the world’s best practices in STPs and smart cities and their value-added
    contributions in attracting prospective tenants. Introduces numerous Autonomous
    Systems as a Service frameworks for STPs to not only act as the game-changing
    business models but also serve as a testbed for park residents to test and evaluate
    new technologies. Proffers an analysis of security and privacy risks associated
    with autonomous systems and data-oriented services. Recommends appropriate security
    and privacy measures to secure autonomous systems at various layers of the network
    architecture. The data security and privacy measures are further supplemented
    by a consolidated data strategy and viable technical controls to achieve desired
    cyber protection. Stipulates the role of universities/HEIs (Higher Education Institutions)
    in the success of the STP. Establishes a list of components/entities that should
    form part of the STP to help attain most of its goals/objectives. B. Organization
    of the Paper The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section II covers
    some basic concepts related to STPs. At the same time, Section III illustrates
    numerous value-creation techniques and proposes ingenious application scenarios
    of ASaaS for STPs. Whereas Section IV highlights threats to data security and
    privacy in autonomous systems and related defensive measures. In addition, Section
    V delineates universities’ role in STPs, and Section VI highlights some essential
    components of STPs. Finally, future challenges and conclusions are emphasized
    in Section VII, and Section VIII respectively. SECTION II. STP - Basic Concepts
    Before we dwell upon the benefits and objectives of STPs, it is imperative to
    differentiate between a smart city and a STP. Both smart cities and STPs are considered
    the hub of technological innovation that offers high-class livability and a quality
    lifestyle. However, it is perceived that a smart city is just an application of
    technology with the vision of providing futuristic, safe, and interactive environment
    for living [30]. In comparison, a STP is believed to be a property-based initiative
    close to HEIs [31], that fosters innovation by increasing R&D activities, extending
    cooperation among firms [32], facilitating knowledge transfer, and promoting the
    transfer-of-technology (ToT). Moreover, STPs also provide infrastructure, business
    support, and allied services to support the growth of startups and young firms
    [33]. In general, the vision of STPs is to bolster the knowledge-based economy
    and contribute towards local and regional economic growth [34]. Since the distinction
    between STP and a smart city is now clear, it is important to illustrate the fundamental
    benefits of STPs. A. Benefits of a STP Some of the perceived benefits expected
    out of STPs with respect to various stakeholders are shown in Table.1. It is evident
    that to harbor a knowledge-based economy, a meticulously planned and efficiently
    managed STP accrues knowledge sharing between startups and other technology-based
    young firms. Another significant contribution of a science park with a pristine
    location is increased collaboration between co-located organizations, technology-based
    young firms, industrial R&D centers, and universities. Hence, multiple-stakeholders
    residing, working, and collaborating in the shared space also benefit from unplanned
    data sharing. It is also believed that proximity to universities’ research brain
    in the STP is productive for all the stakeholders. Correspondingly, if we consider
    other factors such as proximity to HEIs’ research centers, closeness to same sector
    firms, availability of specialized labs and testing facilities, a well-equipped
    and prepared STP stimulates innovation [15]. Which subsequently results in a high
    number of patents and IP [35]. TABLE 1 Benefits of a Science and Technology Park
    Furthermore, a well-reputed science park boosts the tenants’ image (all stakeholders)
    [36]. It also attracts customers to various state-of-the-art products developed
    by commercially oriented or science-based firms. Moreover, as discussed earlier,
    a well-managed STP usually offers high livability conditions for its prospective
    tenants [37]. Additionally, a STP developed with a futuristic approach provides
    various high-tech services to its users, thus attracting a large number of national
    and international companies with promising growth potential [38]. Therefore, a
    user-oriented specialized STP supplied with a high standard lifestyle, essential
    commodities, public spaces, and high tech research facilities promotes social
    networking [39] and attracts a skilled workforce [40], [41]. Finally, the utmost
    benefit of a STP to any region is increased economic activity based on research
    and accelerated development of new technologies [21]. Undoubtedly, the above-quoted
    benefits are attainable; however, a STP should carefully set its objectives to
    achieve desired goals. B. Objectives of a STP Keeping in view the desired benefits
    of STPs discussed in the previous section, some of the elementary objectives (shown
    in Fig.1) that a science park must pursuit include: Reduce the gap between universities
    and the industry. Increase networking and collaboration between park tenants by
    facilitating accessibility [42]. Augment knowledge sharing [43]. Ease ToT between
    various stakeholders. Enhance regional technological developments. Promote innovation
    and boost regional economic development. Increase innovation efficiency [44].
    Help educational institutions/startups showcase their technologies to secure funds
    for future developments [45]. Accelerate technological development by localizing
    technology-based firms at one location [29]. Facilitate regional progress by establishing
    a localized mechanism for shared resources and knowledge development [46]. Support
    product development life cycle through all stages, i.e., (a) concept development,
    (b) design and engineering, (c) prototyping, and testing, and (d) launch stage
    [47]. Make the science park a living science city by planning, designing, developing,
    and deploying value-added autonomous tech services for the park tenants. Provide
    a conducive environment and infrastructure for the testing and evaluation of new
    technologies. Promote and support local industry, and the R&D sector, by developing
    autonomous systems locally. Provide excellent and cost-effective services (including
    accommodation, dining, workspace, business support, leisure, networking venues,
    etc.) FIGURE 1. Objectives of a science and technology park. Show All SECTION
    III. Value Creation for the STP Tenants It is envisioned that the progressive
    firms and other industry representatives residing in the science park facilitate
    achieving most of the park objectives. Hence, a STP should endeavor to offer unique
    value-added services to attract progressive tenants. Correspondingly, researchers
    in [18] emphasize that the science parks should have the means to make alluring
    contributions to all the stakeholders. Also, there should be exceptional reasons
    why the industry, startups, entrepreneurs, and Venture Capitalists (VCs) come
    to the STPs. Therefore, to form a consensus on the essential attributes that a
    science park should have, we analyzed some of the world’s best practices in various
    science parks around the globe, including the Netherlands and Sweden [15], [48].
    It is observed that the critical attributes of a science park (that the park tenants
    perceive to be attracted to) are business support, park management’s commitment
    and expertise, proximity to universities and other firms, and high tech infrastructure.
    According to “Triple Helix Theory” [49], integration of industry, academia, and
    other sectors is a common trait of successful STPs. There are other contributing
    factors/attributes as well, which are highlighted in the following paragraphs.
    Considering the importance of business support, science parks usually support
    the new firms initially during the park’s planning stages and later during provisioning
    of desired services. Correspondingly, during the science park planning stages,
    the business support aims to attract quality firms, startups, and entrepreneurs.
    Moreover, park management selects/prioritizes the prospective tenants based on
    their knowledge intensity, innovativeness and by mapping their technical profile
    to the on-site HEI’s research activities. The park management can also offer business
    support to the tenants in the form of consultation related to marketing, finance,
    IP, copyrights, and government regulations. Furthermore, financial support to
    the firms may be provided through public and private VC organizations and seed
    capital providers. Subsequently, the activities and services that fall under business
    support once the science park is operational may include the university-led incubation
    and development programs. The incubators advise and assist the firms through kick-start
    programs in the initial period (a few months) of their establishment. The assistance
    can be external consultancy, access to lawyers, marketing experts, business coaches,
    and technical facilities. Correspondingly, young firms or startups are also interested
    in various training activities offered by the park management. These may include
    specialized workshops, symposiums, or demonstrations. The new businesses are also
    interested in multiple entrepreneurship programs offered during their respective
    preincubation, incubation, and post-incubation period. These programs also help
    the startups develop/refine their business ideas and reduce the investors’ risks.
    Another critical attribute is industrial R&D that increases collaboration and
    stimulates innovation. Then is the establishment of laboratories, which facilitates
    testing and experimentation. Similarly, proximity to universities and co-located
    firms/startups results in more complex innovation and a high number of patents.
    Thus the enterprises prefer to locate on-park premises to establish connections
    with the universities and associated research centers [50]. Moreover, an affordable
    and high-tech workplace as per business’s needs, including green environmentally
    sound spaces, always attracts potential tenants. In addition, information sharing
    between park tenants is also believed to enhance innovation, increase collaboration
    among the stakeholders, and boost technological development. It is also observed
    that the STP tenants are interested in the social events organized by the park
    management or other stakeholders. These events are taken as networking opportunities
    to increase personal interaction, knowledge transfer, and seek professional partnerships.
    The social events may include academic conferences, seminars, and roadshows. In
    the context of social events, the provision of facilities such as conference rooms,
    exhibition halls, auditoriums, and theatres by the science park management is
    considered an essential element in attracting enterprises and industry leaders
    to the park premises. Moreover, the availability of a resilient, sustainable,
    and highly livable environment is also a contributing factor to attract people
    from various walks of life to the park. Likewise, park tenants also expect the
    availability of essential services such as restaurants, bars, banks, ATMs, supermarkets,
    and post offices. Moreover, prestigious locations are in high demand by startups
    and high-tech companies to showcase their ideas and technologies. A science park’s
    site should also be in closer proximity to an international airport to facilitate
    cargo and human resource transfer/travel. Similarly, accessibility is another
    contributing factor to attract firms to the science park. Where accessibility
    refers to the access to support services and technical knowledge provided by the
    network of neighboring/co-located firms [51]. Moreover, a clearly defined business
    plan by the STP for valuable knowledge sharing and service provisioning is also
    seen positively by the park tenants [21]. Researchers have also identified that
    the tech firms chose to stay on-site in a well-established science park to build
    up their prestige [52], [53]. Finally, the science park management’s commitment,
    expertise, and services offered also play a vital role in the success of a STP.
    A. Case Study of Singapore - the Smartest City of the Future The previous section
    highlighted the importance of business support, proximity to universities, and
    other critical attributes that mostly contribute to a STP’s success. However,
    in this section, we analyze various factors that make a city highly futuristic
    and boost its livability by improving its residents’ quality of life. The same
    attributes can be inherited by the STPs to transform into high-tech living science
    cities and attract prospective tenants. For this purpose, because of developed
    IT infrastructure, strong government support, effective IP laws, and innovation-friendly
    environment, we selected Singapore as a case study [54]–[56]. The Singapore government
    endeavors to make Singapore the smartest city in the world by 2025. In this regard,
    Singapore is developing and implementing future technologies in eight highly technical
    and specialized areas. The first on the list is the use of autonomous cars. Singapore
    has implemented autonomous taxis since 2015, and to further promulgate the use
    of driver-less cars, the National University of Singapore (NUS) has developed
    and implemented the concept of self-propelled golf buggies. Similarly, Nanyang
    Technological University (NTU) is working on driver-less city buses and aims to
    bring them on the roads by 2022. Secondly, the Singapore Government is using drones
    to enhance the local policing capability to monitor crowds. The specialized police
    drones are equipped with powerful sirens, blue and red police lights, and a searchlight
    almost ten times more potent than a standard car headlight. Besides, the police
    are also making use of autonomous ground bots (rovers) for remote surveillance.
    The rover is equipped with cameras and sensors and is fully independent. However,
    it can be programmed with pre-planned routes for navigation. Moreover, to raise
    the living standard and quality of life of its people, the Singapore Government
    has paid due attention to smart homes. These houses have been equipped to automate
    the daily routine of the residents. In this context, the house lighting, Heating
    Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC), infotainment, energy, and security settings
    can be customized as per the user’s preferences. For example, the smart home can
    be configured to switch off extra lights, raise curtains, reduce security level,
    start the coffee machine, and regulate shower temperature under the good morning
    settings as per user-preferred timings. Similarly, the settings can be configured
    to prepare for bedtime. Correspondingly, robotic vacuums and smart house assistance
    are common elements in Singapore households. Furthermore, to ensure citizens’
    security on the roads, the Singapore Government is developing smart lamp posts
    (street lights). These lamp posts are equipped with numerous sensors to monitor
    environmental changes, respond to high sounds like car crashes, and screams for
    help. Also, plans have been made to install smart radars and facial recognition
    systems to detect unusual traffic and unlawful citizens. Another technological
    landmark achievement of Singapore is the ubiquitous use of robots. It is estimated
    that there are around four hundred and eighty-eight robots per ten thousand people
    in Singapore. The robots have been employed in shopping malls where people can
    interact with them by asking questions. These robots can also sing, rap, wink,
    crack jokes, and perform cleaning duties. They are also being used in restaurants
    to collect and return trays and used crockery from the dining tables. A more official
    version of the robots is being used as robocops at airports. These robocops act
    as auxiliary police and perform various security duties. Another breed of robots
    is being employed in pharmacies to assist its human counterparts in delivering
    medicines. Other than these, there are numerous personal, social, and service
    robots, e.g., a robot-coach that advises and demonstrates physical exercises to
    the senior citizens. Another monumental step by the Singapore Government is the
    amalgamation with Virtual Reality (VR). Subsequently, different VR applications
    have been developed and put into use, e.g., intelligent interactive mirrors have
    been deployed to help kids with learning disabilities to practice various tasks
    such as tracking a train or finding the way to a particular restaurant. Similarly,
    equal attention has been given to Augmented Reality (AR) applications used by
    various enterprises to attract customers to their products and try them virtually.
    Lastly, the Singapore Government is in the process of deploying a three-dimensional
    (3D) city model to provide a testing ground to students, researchers, citizens,
    and government officials for various learning, planning, and professional activities.
    B. Autonomous Systems as a Service Keeping in view the discussion on park attributes
    and cutting edge technologies in the preceding sections, we propose a unique feature
    of Autonomous Systems as a Service (ASaaS). In this business model, numerous autonomous
    systems and smart applications provide unparalleled services to the park tenants.
    One of the reasons we are interested in ASaaS is that these are economical besides
    other value-added services. They also reduce the associated risks to human lives
    [57] in the provision of various services and increase the quality of life. However,
    before these autonomous systems are discussed, it is imperative to understand
    an autonomous system’s basic concepts and requirements in a STP setting. 1) Autonomous
    System Definition The history of autonomous systems dates back to 1964 when Leonard
    Scheer from APL Adaptive Machines Group developed and demonstrated sensors and
    actuators supported autonomous rover system. The rover could navigate, identify
    an electrical outlet, and plug in to recharge its batteries without any human
    intervention. Hence, an autonomous system can be defined as a system that can
    change/modify its behavior when subjected to unexpected events during operation
    [57]. However, once we talk about ASaaS in a science park, a particular system
    must meet some essential requirements. 2) Requirements for an Autonomous System
    in a STP An autonomous system should be designed and developed based on open systems
    and standards-based approaches for compatibility with other technologies. It should
    interact with users through a well-designed mobile application (app). In addition
    to default settings, the system should have the capability of being personalized
    by remembering user’s preferences so that his experience is always familiar and
    easy. It must conform to respective country’s legislative, regulatory, and standards
    frameworks, e.g., Section 95 of Australian Government’s Privacy Act 1988 [58],
    outlines the guidelines issued by National Health and Medical Research Council
    (NHMRC) concerning handling/processing of personal health information. Ensure
    security and privacy of users’ data at all stages of STP operation. It should
    be self-sustained (including operation and maintenance). To reduce the carbon
    footprint and support renewable energy technologies, the system should focus on
    using solar energy, energy harvesting mechanism, or other green energy technologies.
    To create a unified or collated picture of the ASaaS to the park tenants, all
    the autonomous systems should be able to integrate. It should support open communications
    protocols/standards. The system should have minimal operation and maintenance
    requirements (including infrastructure, human resources, power, spares, scheduled
    servicing, etc.) Availability of any simulation technology or a lab setup related
    to a particular/multiple autonomous systems will help the researchers and industry
    partners test and further improve respective technology/system. C. Proposed Autonomous
    Systems for a STP Fig.2 gives an overview of the autonomous systems that we have
    conceived for STPs. The design details, features, and the services offered by
    respective systems to the STP tenants are illustrated in following paragraphs.
    FIGURE 2. Autonomous systems in science and technology parks. Show All 1) Smart
    and Green Environment According to [15] a vibrant and green landscaped public
    area indicates the level of environmental quality. Correspondingly, potential
    tenants of the science park value a clean and healthy environment for quality
    living. Hence, we propose an autonomous environment monitoring system that is
    self-sustainable in monitoring and maintaining healthy air and water quality levels.
    Such an approach is also expected to ensure high flora and fauna standards in
    the STPs. The factors that contribute to achieving the desired outcomes through
    autonomous smart and green environment system may include: Monitoring of air pollution
    (including vehicle emission control), and water quality. Monitoring of soil quality
    to assist in the growth of vegetation in the area. Soil moisture testing to facilitate
    smart irrigation. Smart weather monitoring; Weather sensors can be integrated
    with intelligent street lights. These sensors can monitor and analyze the effects
    of global warming and propose remedial measures. Smart tree monitoring: Smart
    tree sensors enable efficient monitoring of tree states. This not only ensures
    a cost-effective optimal tree growth and cheaper maintenance but also helps in
    early detection of diseases. A green environment is not possible without green
    energy such as solar or wind power. Hence, the due focus should be given to renewable
    energy sources in a STP. Correspondingly, to promulgate green environment, researchers
    in [59] highlight the importance of sustainable, intelligent buildings. It is
    believed that the availability of smart and green buildings is one of the main
    attractions to lure potential tenants to the STPs. The main features of intelligent
    buildings include indoor environment control, water, and energy efficiency, eco-friendly
    construction, roof-top/vertical gardens, durable and sustainable design, waste
    reduction and management, smart surveillance and intrusion detection system, disaster
    response, high tech ICT services, dynamic and spacious workspaces, and last but
    not the least charging stations for electric/hybrid vehicles. Similarly, since
    the onset of the fourth revolution in agriculture triggered by the advancement
    in ICT, especially Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, there has been an increased
    focus on smart/autonomous farming [60]. Smart farms not only ensure food sustainability
    but also make efficient use of the available space. Today, numerous robotic machines
    can autonomously perform various farming/agriculture operations, including weeding,
    harvesting, plowing, fertilizing, and irrigation. In addition, autonomous drones
    have been developed to calculate biomass development and fertilization status
    of the crops [60]. The drones also provide visual information to the farmers concerning
    various plant diseases. Similarly, advancement in IoT technologies can be beneficial
    in cattle, horses, ducks, swans, or other domestic animals/wildlife management.
    Correspondingly, we propose a business model of Autonomous Farming as a Service
    in the subsequent paras. a: Autonomous Farming as a Service To patronage the concept
    of a STP as a self-sustainable autonomous greenfield project, there may be one
    to two-acre size farms to grow different crops, vegetables, and fruits to sustain
    park tenants. Hence, to effectively and efficiently realize agriculture (Agri)
    farms’ development and autonomous management in STPs, we propose Autonomous Farming
    as a Service (aFaaS). The proposed system aspires to tackle conventional agriculture
    problems such as high machinery costs, safety risks concerning massive machines,
    shortage of skilled labor, the slower value of trade-ins, long working hours,
    wastage of products, and materials during seeding, fertilizing, spraying, harvesting,
    picking, sorting, and irrigation. Moreover, it is difficult for farmers to detect
    and identify crop/plant diseases in time for effective treatment without losses
    in crop yields in traditional settings. Furthermore, the human workforce’s safety
    and health concerns due to accidents while working with heavy machinery and pesticides
    is also a matter of grave concern. Hence, the concept of precision agriculture/farming
    involves farm management with the support of various technologies. The primary
    objective is to improve crop production and environmental quality. Thus, to address
    above mentioned problems, assist farmers in optimizing every acre of their operation,
    and achieve high productivity with reduced cost effect, aFaaS utilizes advancements
    in agricultural technologies, especially the autonomous systems [61]–[63]. Before
    illustrating aFaaS business model shown in Fig.3, it is highlighted that all the
    autonomous vehicles, robots, and agricultural machines have some common traits.
    They all are equipped with a navigation system and multiple layers of safety equipment,
    sensors, and tools to detect obstacles (tree line, water bodies, power lines,
    rocks, etc.), perform self-diagnostics and generate an alarm in the case of any
    error/faults to notify owners. The sensing and safety equipment includes LiDAR
    (Light Detection and Ranging) to create a 3D map of the area, SONAR (Sound Navigation
    and Ranging), visual cameras, and IR sensors to detect obstacles, kill switches
    for emergency stop, environmental sensors to monitor temperature, humidity, soil
    moisture, wind speed and GPS for navigation [64]. FIGURE 3. Autonomous farming
    as a service. Show All Moreover, before the autonomous agricultural machinery
    is put into operation, the farmer creates the path plan by entering the boundary
    and permanent obstacles information for each field/farm on the field’s satellite
    image using aFaaS user app. To cater to people who are not comfortable with computers
    and technology, they can follow the “Drive and Learn” approach. In which, the
    farmer can map the field/farm by driving in the farm. After that, with the help
    of LiDAR and other sensing equipment, the field/farm boundary and obstacles are
    automatically mapped through the aFaaS app. The autonomous robots/machines can
    then move on the prescribed route using GPS. Moreover, the farmer can set various
    parameters for a particular agriculture operation, e.g., in the case of seeding,
    he can set the seed density, the pattern of laying, and the distance between each
    seed location through aFaaS app. Another key highlight of aFaaS is that it does
    not employ exiting large-scale agricultural machineries such as tractors, harvesters,
    and sprayers. Instead, based on the concept of Mobile Agricultural Robot Swarms
    (MARS) [65] and swarm farms [66], aFaaS employs swarms of small agricultural robots
    with a modular design. These robots can be customized for a particular task. Moreover,
    the robots are carried and managed through a mobile Robots Transport and Coordination
    Unit (RTCU). The RTCU acts as a transporter for the robots and can also store
    supplies, e.g., seeds, fertilizers, water, pesticides, spare tools, batteries,
    etc. RTCU also functions as a Real-time Kinematic (RTK) base station to ensure
    robots’ positional accuracy. On the other hand, the robots can operate around
    the clock with satellite navigation and data management through aFaaS and STP
    Data Arena (being illustrated later in Section-III-C8). At the same time, the
    farm owners have permanent access to their data. As shown in Fig.3, the autonomous
    robots can perform numerous agricultural/farming tasks [67] including soil sampling
    and testing, seeding, planting, spraying, weeding, crop protection and inspection,
    watering, harvesting, fruit picking, sorting, materials handling, pruning, and
    grass cutting/mowing. It can also be seen that aFaaS may employ a combination
    of aerial and ground robots as per the requirements of the tasks. Although some
    of the agricultural/farming operations can be achieved by both platforms, yet
    there are some distinctions. Ground-based autonomous robots varying in shapes
    and sizes such as a crawler, caterpillar [68], [69] and the most simplistic wheeled
    platforms are the common types. As compared to their aerial counterparts, ground
    robots can be equipped with more sensors and actuators without considering their
    weight. The sensors may include GPS, LiDAR (considered better than Radars), SONAR,
    visual cameras, kill switches, and weather sensors. Moreover, the autonomous robots
    designed for picking fruits may have different types of end-effectors, e.g., electric
    gripper, pneumatic gripper, suction cups [70], gecko gripper, origami flower gripper,
    fruit picker, trash fingers [71] and other robotic tools, depending upon the shape
    and size of the fruit, bins, or nature of the task. Similarly, to compensate for
    the terrain-specific limitations of wheeled robots, spherical robots can also
    be used in all-terrain types for exploration [72], surveillance [73], and measuring
    soil temperature and moisture for precise agriculture [74]. Hence, some of the
    tasks that can be performed explicitly by ground-based autonomous agricultural
    robots include: Seeding and planting: Ground-based robots controlled by RTCU can
    be employed in a swarm for seeding or planting crops/saplings. Weeding: It involves
    using computer vision and machine learning (ML) to detect weed in cereal crops
    such as wheat, rice, maize, oat, barley, rye, and millet. The weed can be controlled
    by two methods. The first one is precision spraying, in which the robots accurately
    spray herbicides at the exact location of the weed to prevent any overlapping
    or overflow of the pesticides. However, chemically removing the weed has other
    associated hazards affecting actual crops and adjacent soil. Hence, to manually
    remove the weed in an old-fashioned way without any labor and in less time, autonomous
    robots can be equipped with a plucking tool. It is also visualized that the robots
    can autonomously navigate different field configurations and run unstoppable for
    long hours [75]. Precision spraying: Use of pesticides is necessary to prevent
    crop losses and improve yield. Conventionally, farmers use traditional sprayers
    to apply pesticides. These sprayers distribute them uniformly over the entire
    field. Subsequently, due to toxicity, pesticides have a significant impact on
    the environment and people’s health. Therefore, there is a need for accurate delivery
    of defoliants in the correct amount using a fleet of autonomous robots to reduce
    the impact on humans and the environment [76]. Soil moisture and temperature sensing:
    Ground robots equipped with the right tools are the most suitable for checking
    soil moisture and temperature, especially once crops/plants grow up and it is
    not easy to access soil from the top. Precision irrigation. Based on soil moisture
    and soil temperature readings, the ground-based robots can be utilized for precise
    watering of the crops/plants. Such a controlled irrigation mechanism will help
    in conserving water, especially in dry or drought-hit areas. Measurement of water
    stress: An autonomous ground-based robot equipped with a micro-thermal and hyperspectral
    camera can measure water stress in a farm/field. Water stress can arise due to
    excess water (in case of floods) or water deficit (during drought) and affect
    crop productivity. Therefore, measurement of water stress level in a field is
    essential to ensure precise watering of the crops/plants. Measurement of Leaf
    Area Index (LAI): Robots on the ground are suitable to measure LAI. Where LAI
    is the ratio of leaf surface to the unit ground area, which reflects the essential
    ecological characteristics by quantifying the amount of foliage in the plant canopy
    [77]. Autonomous ground robots are also useful for grass cutting/mowing without
    any human intervention. In comparison with ground-based robots, aerial platforms
    can be employed for: Pest and disease control: Pests and diseases can be detected
    in crops/plants by applying computer vision techniques on RGB (Red Green Blue)
    and 3D images of the crops/plants [78], [79]. Moreover, the same can also be done
    by taking samples from the fields/orchards and analyzing them in the laboratory.
    Correspondingly, the correct amount of fertilizers can be calculated and applied
    to the crops [80], [81] with precision and economy of effort using robots. There
    are, however, different parameters that need to be optimized for the effective
    and efficient delivery of fertilizers. These parameters include the operational
    height and velocity of the Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and the volume of fertilizer
    delivered as per different heights and types of plants. Yield Prediction: UAVs
    can also collect RGB and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data from
    the crop/plants. The collected data can then be analyzed to predict crop yield
    using deep Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) [82]. Distributed environmental monitoring
    and assistance in crop pollination: Micro aerial robots to the likes of RoboBees
    [83] may be employed to monitor environmental parameters. They can also assist
    in the pollination of plants as well as crops in the STP. Crop inspection and
    protection: Appropriately equipped autonomous drones can inspect the crops and
    plants. The drones provide high-resolution images that can be used to check crops,
    detect diseases, and find unseeded rows or bare soil in the field [84]. Similarly,
    UAVs can also protect crops and fruit trees from birds. Cattle spotting: Australia
    is home to world’s largest cattle stations. E.g., Anna Creek has an area of around
    twenty-four thousand square kilometers, followed by three other stations with
    an area of more than fifteen thousand square kilometers [85]. Therefore, cattle
    in such large areas can only be tracked and monitored by using aerial platforms.
    b: Agri Farms Mapping Service Mapping of agricultural and forestry land provides
    means to estimate current production and environmental states. It also helps in
    monitoring progress over time. The information on production and ecological conditions
    can be used in site-specific farming to tailor specific crop and soil treatments
    for each field [86], [87]. Keeping in view the advancements in 3D mapping technologies
    and their benefits for the farmers, a STP may offer Agri farms mapping service.
    There are two ways to create a 3D map of a field: using ground-based robots and,
    secondly, by utilizing aerial technologies. Correspondingly, satellite imagery
    and the images obtained from manned aircraft are used to map land all over the
    world. However, satellite and aircraft sensory data’s spatial resolution is of
    low quality compared to a UAV. However, some limitations may affect the quality
    of images or operation of UAVs. E.g., the presence of clouds, the extended data
    delivery times, the need for special permissions, and the cost effect. Subsequently,
    the low spatial resolution sensory data may underestimate productivity and environmental
    factors and result in insufficient treatment coverage [88]. Besides, with the
    advancements in vertical take-off and landing technologies, UAVs like quadcopters
    are among the best alternatives. These UAVs are economical, efficient, can carry
    multiple sensors, and do not have many restrictions on the usage [89]. UAVs equipped
    with multi-spatial sensors, including LiDAR, RGB, thermal, and hyperspectral imaging,
    can be used to map green farms. Similarly, LiDAR mapping data can then be used
    to evaluate the impact of agricultural production methods [90]. In addition to
    large-scale farms, LiDAR mapping and monitoring [91] can also be applied to orchards
    and wineries. Moreover, the mapped data can also estimate crop volume/canopy and
    related biomass for precise delivery of nitrogen (N), which is the primary source
    of nutrients for crops/plants. Similarly, ground-based mobile robots equipped
    with a stereo camera, location sensor, and inertial measurement unit [92] can
    create 3D terrain maps using Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithm
    for precise agriculture [93]. We believe that the above-discussed mapping technologies
    can also be used to create a 3D map of a STP for the urban archaeology project.
    c: Soil Testing as a Service (STaaS) Soil plays an integral part in keeping the
    environment healthy by regulating N use and carbon flow. Similarly, soils help
    in mitigating greenhouse gasses [94]. However, crop health may be threatened by
    soil-borne diseases. Numerous factors influence soil-borne diseases such as block
    selection, crop rotation, varieties, nutrition, irrigation, and fumigation [95].
    Therefore, healthy soil is essential for the environment and high yields in Agri
    farms. Hence, to facilitate commercial and household farmers, the STP must offer
    STaaS, in which autonomous robots collect soil samples from the prescribed location.
    The soil samples are then analyzed and profiled for the microbial population using
    Next Generation DNA Sequencing (NGS). STaaS may also provide agronomic insights
    from soil data using AI-driven analytics. The test results will help farmers understand
    their soils and decide on the type and amount of nutrients, fertilizers, and water
    to be used in the farms. There might be a question of what advantages we get by
    using autonomous robots for agricultural tasks. Rather people are a bit pessimistic
    about giving autonomy to the machines. Subsequently, they see it as a safety risk
    in case of a hardware/software failure and a threat to human jobs. However, in
    reality, autonomous technologies are paving the way to create and grow new industries.
    Similarly, jobs requiring skills related to servicing, managing, observing, and
    optimizing autonomous systems’ performance are emerging. Moreover, the demand
    for competent data engineers and analysts is also on the rise. Some other benefits
    of using robots in the agriculture/farming sector are: Robots can perform dangerous
    and high precision monotone tasks. Autonomous robots can be more efficient in
    performing Agri tasks because they better understand the situation based on sensor
    data and access to online databases and forecasts. Robots mostly operate on batteries
    or solar energy; hence they contribute to a greener future with less carbon footprint
    and noise pollution. Robots will optimize the use of resources, including water,
    energy, time, and skilled workforce. Thus, increasing the yields of the farms.
    Save farm workers from various risks/hazards including: Exposure to pesticides.
    long working hours. Injuries from heavy machinery. Exposure to heat and ultraviolet
    (UV) rays. Organic dust toxic syndrome that is caused by inhaling dust from moldy
    material, thus causing an inflammatory reaction in the lungs. Exposure to excessive
    noise from machines. Risk of accidents caused by fatigue, wild weather, and equipment
    failure. Stress of health-related claims and huge costs of medicines. However,
    at the same time, there are particular challenges associated with using robots
    in farming. For instance, unlike industrial, the agricultural environment is not
    controlled. Hence, natural calamities like rain, storms, flood, fire, and earthquakes
    affect the operations. Therefore, agriculture requires more versatile and robust
    robots. Moreover, despite high economic and environmental benefits, the adoption
    of autonomous Agri technologies is very slow [96]. This lag can be attributed
    to knowledge gaps in farmers around the world. Besides, precision farming has
    not been adopted in an umbrella deployment. Instead, some specific tasks are automated
    to meet the farmers’ needs. Correspondingly, the existing robotic technology in
    precision agriculture is limited to vehicle guidance and auto-steer systems. The
    reason is that the economic benefits are easily achievable without requiring the
    integration of additional components or decision support systems [96]. However,
    it is envisaged that aFaaS offered by the futuristic STPs will pave the way for
    better understanding and complete transformation of traditional agriculture/farming
    operations with autonomous technologies. d: Autonomous Vertical Farms To avoid
    uncertainties emerging from natural calamities and global warming, a more refined
    variant of smart farms is autonomous vertical farming. The concept of vertical
    farms is not new. In 2010, Kono Designs created an urban farm in a nine-story
    office building (Pasona Headquarters) in Tokyo, Japan. In addition to providing
    green space, this farm also allows its employees to grow and harvest their food
    at work [97]. Vertical farming is expected to be the best option to meet future
    food production requirements in the backdrop of the rapidly increasing global
    population, shrinking agricultural lands, and adverse effects of global warming
    [98]. Hence, vertical farming’s primary objective is to yield maximum harvest
    with economical use of resources and zero waste in a minimum possible space. E.g.,
    as shown in Fig.4, a small autonomous farm can even fit into a standard shipping
    container [99]. The farm is equipped with various sensors and actuators to automate
    the processes without any human intervention. The smart environment provides a
    crop with a perfect climate, including light, temperature, humidity, nutrients,
    and water every day. On the contrary, it is impossible in the natural environment.
    FIGURE 4. Autonomous vertical farm. Show All One of the significant benefits of
    growing plants in such a concealed/controlled environment is that there is no
    need for any pesticides or herbicides. Hence, there is no danger of passing any
    contamination to humans. The automated farm in the shipping container is designed
    in a way that one container can accommodate hundreds of trays. At the same time,
    the dimensions of the trays can be adjusted as per the size of the plant/crop.
    Therefore, each vertical farm can be individually climate controlled, allowing
    for a perfect environment for each crop at every stage of its life. Moreover,
    the sensors-based watering system ensures that water and nutrients are distributed
    as per requirement, and the excess water is also recycled. It has been tested
    and proven that autonomous vertical farms yield quality products in terms of size,
    taste, and nutrient value and ensure the efficient and economical use of resources
    [100], [101]. 2) Smart Living Besides dynamic workspaces, smart living is an equal
    fascination for present and future park tenants. The desired services in this
    regard include: Smart Homes: Houses with an intelligent security system, smart
    lighting, and HVAC (energy-saving mode when the house is empty) are no more out
    of reach. Hence, STP’s management must provide intelligent homes equipped with
    high-tech gadgets/technologies to its tenants. Similarly, the availability of
    intelligent appliances such as a smart refrigerator with inventory notifications
    and smart vehicle diagnostics (fuel, battery, tire pressure, coolant, engine oil)
    is also vital. Correspondingly, an intelligent home application (app) must allow
    the residents to configure different ambient settings such as “bedtime” mode.
    In this mode, the unnecessary lights (as per user’s preferences) are switched
    off, the security system is armed, and nonrequired appliances are put into idle
    mode. In the same way in the “Good Morning” mode, the security lights and nonessential
    security equipment are switched off, and necessary appliances such as coffee machine,
    toaster, and oven are warmed up. Smart Personal Assistant: This feature allows
    providing services to a tenant as per his personal preferences. E.g., the tenant
    gets an alert for wake-up as per daily traffic, road and weather conditions, office
    time, meetings schedule, or if the vehicle requires refueling. He may also be
    notified when there is a restaurant deal on his favorite dish, or he gets an alert
    for his favorite movie show in the cinema. Similarly, a resident may be suggested
    to attend a social/professional networking event in the science park based on
    his professional/personal interests, research area, skills, etc. eHealth: Remote
    healthcare is considered a basic need in the current pandemics era. The remote
    health monitoring devices comprising sensing and actuating systems keep track
    of an individual’s vital physiological signs and inform the medical personnel
    immediately upon any medical emergency. In this context, a portable, lightweight
    on-body sensing device can monitor a person’s vitals, including heart rate, ECG,
    blood pressure, and blood sugar. It can also keep track of and inform the patient
    at the time of his usual medication. The data or any alarm generated by these
    devices instantly notifies the medical center for emergency response [102], [103].
    Smart Utilities: For efficient usage of home utilities such as water, gas, and
    electricity, smart metering can be offered as a service (SMaaS). Hence, the residents
    can be informed about the utilities’ usage in real-time. This service can be provided
    in the form of a smart metering app embedded in the science park user dashboard
    (main app). The smart metering app will assist the users in efficient and economical
    use of the utilities based on peak and off-peak hours [104]. Moreover, data collected
    through smart meters help the service providers detect any leakages, line losses,
    or faults at the earliest than the manual metering services [105]. Likewise, smart
    metering also reduces the cost of manual meter reading, and the continuous information
    flow helps the distributors understand demand patterns and supply forecasts. Hence,
    the utility companies can reduce operational costs and pass some of this financial
    relief onto the consumers. iShopping: Although world’s first VR-based shopping
    app was launched in May 2016 to enhance customers’ shopping experience [106].
    However, in a post-pandemic (COVID-19) environment, online shopping has increased
    enormously [107]. For example, in South Australia, online shopping has seen an
    increase of sixty-four percent (Year Over Year (YOY)) in November 2020 [108].
    No wonder businesses worldwide have started using immersive VR environments to
    provide an interactive in-store equivalent shopping experience to the customers
    without leaving their homes [109]. Hence, today people can shop for clothes by
    trying them virtually using mobile VR and AR apps. Moreover, they can also buy
    products, e.g., furniture, by virtually decorating their house/room space. Therefore,
    we foresee STPs offering a VR/AR-based shopping services to the park tenants in
    both online and in-store environments. The objective should be to make the life
    of the park tenants productive and easy. Some other features of the perceived
    VR/AR-based shopping environment in the STPs may include; display of product’s
    key features, e.g., for food products, it may show its origin, date of the package,
    user rating, taste, seed or seedless, nutritional information, special offers,
    and comparative prices at other stores. Smart Pet Grooming: In today’s busy life,
    it is challenging and stressful for people working in offices for long hours to
    take care of their pets at home. Hence, to facilitate researchers, developers,
    and other tenants at STPs, a smart pet monitoring, and grooming system is recommended.
    Such a system should have the capability to monitor the pet’s whereabouts, interact
    and play with it like humans, take it for a walk (in case of dogs), conduct scheduled
    or emergency visits to the vet, and feed the pets at times prescribed by the owner.
    This interactive assistance in the absence of a human owner is expected to keep
    the pets stress-free and happy and keep them refrained from destructive activities
    while home alone. Correspondingly, there has been a significant advancement in
    computing, sensing, and actuating communications technologies and automobiles.
    However, at the same time, an increase in population has given rise to the number
    of cars on the roads, thus creating a stressful negative impact on the environment,
    human safety, and transportation systems [110]. Hence, to increase drivers’ and
    driving safety, efficient time management, and optimum resource utilization, some
    of the leading tech companies, car manufacturers, and governments have started
    investing in autonomous cars. The greater interest in autonomous car technologies
    is to launch personal and fully commercialized autonomous car fleets to improve
    traffic safety. 3) Mobility as a Service (MaaS) Keeping abreast with world trends
    and future requirements, the modern STPs should aim to provide autonomous MaaS
    for park tenants and visitors. More importantly, the science parks must serve
    as a testing ground for new autonomous transport infrastructure and related technologies
    by providing a rare real-life greenfield city environment. In this regard, the
    primary prerequisite is autonomous intelligence, which must permeate the system,
    from recharging, to maintenance, garaging, parcel handling, scheduling, and user
    interaction. Correspondingly, some other desired constituents of MaaS are: Autonomous
    Vehicles: The fundamental elements for the autonomous vehicles comprise: state
    of the art smart vehicle technologies (hardware and software), fully autonomous
    control, fail-safe navigation system [111], integrated health monitoring system
    to monitor passengers’ health such as heart rate and blood pressure, emergency
    response to inform concerned authorities regarding a safety or health emergency
    event, simple user interaction using Natural Language Processing (NLP) or other
    Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology to communicate with normal as well as
    passengers with a disability. Similarly, self-charging capability is also an essential
    requirement. Hence, once in low power, the autonomous car should automatically
    park itself at a prescribed charging station and get a recharge. Green Transport:
    In a bid to contain the impact of global warming, the STPs should advocate the
    use of green transport within park premises. Green transport may include electric
    or solar vehicles. Moreover, in addition to autonomous, green cars, smart personal
    transportation such as self-driving scooters [112], can be used to commute in
    various areas of the park. Autonomous Infrastructure: Operation of autonomous
    vehicles cannot be completed without autonomous/smart infrastructure. E.g., A
    driver-less vehicle once approaches a charging station to recharge its batteries;
    the charging station should have the provision of wireless charging to prevent
    any human involvement. Similarly, there can be an autonomous car wash and autonomous
    vertical parking system [113], [114] to make efficient use of parking space and
    keep cars safe from thefts, accidents, and other sabotage activities. To make
    the vertical car park more economical and eco-friendly, it can be operated just
    on solar power with sufficient battery backup to sustain through prolonged bad
    weather days. In addition to the autonomous vertical car parks, the autonomous
    cars’ navigation system should be able to communicate with the smart parking systems
    so that the car is taken directly to the empty car space at/near the desired destination.
    Moreover, to make the recharging of driver-less cars more autonomous, the roads
    in the future STPs may be equipped with dynamic wireless charging lanes [115],
    [116]. Besides, when we talk about autonomous infrastructure, the discussion is
    not complete if smart concrete in constructing self-healing roads, pavements,
    and other architectures is not highlighted. Smart concrete is an upcoming technology
    that can extend respective infrastructure’s life by autonomously repairing the
    cracks [117]. The mechanism behind smart concrete is a super absorbent polymer
    that is mixed with the concrete during the construction stage. Over the period,
    when cracks develop in the concrete architecture and water enters these cracks,
    the polymer absorbs the water and produces concrete-like material that fills in
    the gaps. Scientists believe that cracks of even a few microns can be fixed to
    prevent significant damage. Similarly, using Phase Change Materials (PCM) like
    Butyl Stearate (BS), concrete’s thermal properties can be enhanced [118]. As a
    result, the ambient temperature in a concrete building can be maintained as per
    the comfort level of humans by preventing temperature fluctuations. Intelligent
    Traffic Management: One of the rudiments of a successful MaaS system is perceived
    to be the intelligent traffic management system. The primary element of this system
    is the traffic signal operation. According to [119], modern traffic-actuated signals
    ensure traffic flow in minimum possible phases. Where a phase consists of a set
    of nonconflicting movements. E.g., the existing traffic signal system in Australia
    uses an inductive loop detector to adjust the duration of the signal lights, i.e.,
    red or green, by detecting the number of vehicles waiting or moving through an
    intersection. However, inductive loop detectors are not considered very effective
    as compared to infrared (IR) or video radar detectors. Moreover, there is a minimum
    time for which green light is to be displayed for a particular approach/lane even
    if there is no vehicle waiting. Hence, considering STP, a testing ground for various
    autonomous technologies, it is recommended that a dynamic/intelligent traffic
    management system be employed to regulate the traffic based on real-time traffic
    conditions in each lane. These conditions may include traffic density and speed
    of heavy and light vehicles, the emergency vehicle, if any, and the type of road,
    i.e., a lateral, highway, or a local street. This idea is not unrealistic, as
    many researchers have proposed various solutions in this regard. For instance,
    [120] uses real-time data about vehicle volume and waiting time in each lane to
    determine traffic light sequence and length of green light. Similarly, researchers
    in [121] used IR sensors to manipulate traffic signals based on traffic density.
    Also, [122] proposed a monitoring system using street video cameras in parallel
    to the traffic light system to determine different street cases (e.g., empty,
    normal, crowded) in varying weather conditions. Other than intelligent traffic
    signals, we foresee testing of dynamic/adaptive speed bumps on the streets of
    STPs. As shown in Fig.5, an adaptive speed bump system may comprise a speed bump
    sign, speed radar, a control system with an actuator to control the operation
    of the speed bump, and the bump itself. The speed bump remains in de-active mode,
    i.e., parallel to the road during peak hours, once most vehicles are moving within
    the prescribed speed limit. However, when the radar unit detects an incoming car
    driving over the speed limit during off-peak hours, it alerts the control unit,
    which activates the speed bump from a safe distance from the approaching vehicle
    to slow it down. Moreover, to add more security, license plate recognition can
    also be performed to slow down specific vehicles [123]. FIGURE 5. Adaptive road
    bump. Show All 4) Smart Community iHealth: Intelligent health services at community
    level aim at improving medical emergency response, managing patients Electronic
    Health Record (EHR), analysis of community medical data, predict community transfer
    diseases, propose precautions, and make efficient use of resources. In addition,
    data collected from community (local council) medical center may be shared with
    state’s health department for analysis and provision of specialized medical services
    like an air ambulance, special medical consultancy, emergency response, and health
    alerts. Use of Personal, Social, and Service Robots: To foster an ingenious view
    of STPs, we propose the use of personal, social, and service robots. These robots
    will improve the livability in the STPs by autonomously performing various tasks
    and making the processes more cost-effective, risk-free, reliable [124], and productive.
    Although using a personal robot is quite intuitive, one may get confused in differentiating
    between a social and a service robot. A service robot is designed and developed
    to interact with humans as living human machines. Therefore, social robots should
    be realistic, and they should communicate, and cooperate with humans as naturally
    and intelligently as possible [125]. Whereas a service robot is used to automate
    specific or several tasks, where human interaction may not be necessary, e.g.,
    industrial and medical robots [126]. Some use cases of these robots are shown
    in Fig.6. As per a case study on personal robots, people desire that a personal
    robot should clean the house, prepare food, do laundry, serve people, care for
    pets, look after kids, and ensure the security of the house [127]. On the contrary,
    social robots can be used in shopping malls, parks, hospitals, restaurants, airports,
    schools, offices, and public transport to interact with humans and also for security-related
    tasks. Whereas service robots can be used to assist in agriculture, construction,
    industry, inspection and monitoring, medical, and defense-related tasks [126].
    Moreover, every day, numerous incidents globally involve Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT)
    such as chemical spills, leaks, fires, and the intentional release of toxic substances.
    These incidents not only adversely affect human health but also ecosystems and
    the environment. Therefore, the most vulnerable are the emergency services personnel.
    E.g., in South Australia alone, there had been one thousand four hundred and twenty-one
    incidents involving HAZMAT, fire, transport, sabotage, etc., between 2001 and
    2018 [128]. Besides, it is a fact that human rescue workers become a scarce resource
    in disaster scenarios. Therefore, [129] proposes that a single rescue worker should
    supervise a multitude of autonomous robots equipped with appropriate sensors and
    tools in ideal circumstances. These intelligent machines can assist in inspecting
    incident sites from a safe distance, analyzing the type of HAZMAT, damage assessment,
    rubble clearance, and search for survivors. However, there are numerous challenges
    in using autonomous rescue robots as a service. [130]. Firstly, existing rescue
    robots cannot operate autonomously in a harsh environment. Where harsh environments
    are perceived as unknown, unstructured, dynamic, cluttered, hazardous, and limited
    in resources (such as the availability of communications, GPS, and visibility)
    [131], [132]. Hence, machine decision-making capabilities in rescue robot technologies
    need further research. It is also difficult to decide whether a fully autonomous
    or semi-autonomous (teleoperated by a human supervisor) system would be better
    as a general-purpose rescue robot. Another critical challenge for rescue robots
    is the mapping or construction of a path profile. iLighting (Smart Street Lights):
    To augment environmental monitoring, surveillance, security, information dissemination,
    emergency response, and public service, the use of intelligent street lights can
    never be overemphasized. An intelligent street light is an autonomous element
    of the overall smart community. As shown in Fig.7, the iLight is solar-powered
    and equipped with numerous sensors and equipment such as a WiFi transceiver module,
    temperature, humidity, CO2, smoke, and noise sensors, surveillance camera with
    image processing capability, motion sensor, emergency telephone, digital street
    sign, digital info screen, a speaker and a microphone, an electric vehicle (EV)
    charging port, and a power socket for general use (mobile charging). The highlight
    of the iLight is that the surveillance camera with the requisite image processing
    capability can detect and generate alerts for any security or emergency incident
    such as street crime, street fight, bullying, road accident, flash flooding, or
    a prescribed health emergency. Upon receiving an alert, the STP management can
    always monitor the real-time situation and generate an appropriate response. ibuildings:
    The intelligent buildings are mostly equipped with sensing and control infrastructure
    for efficient HVAC and lighting management. Some other technologies may include
    energy generation, storage, and distribution. Smart buildings maximize efficiency
    and productivity. Hence, the essential features envisaged in an ibuilding include
    safety and security, network connectivity, functional spaces, IoT enabled environment
    (HVAC, lighting), layered security (integrated access control, fixed network camera,
    network dome camera, multi-factor authentication locks, intrusion detection),
    safety (HAZMAT, fire, gas, and sabotage detection), and efficient water and energy
    management. Smart Maintenance: It implies using sensors and other surveillance
    means to autonomously monitor and initiate a complaint to the council/park management
    for maintenance issues along with evidence in the form of pictures, videos, or
    sensor data. Smart Waste Management: Waste management is an integral part of a
    green environment. However, in the existing scenario, most of the counties resort
    to manual/predefined waste collection, irrespective of the fact that what percentage
    of a waste bin is full. This may infer extra costs in terms of fuel and waste
    collection vehicles. Moreover, if there is a waste bin with rotting and fast decaying
    food items such as fish waste, meat, and fruits, then if the bin has to wait to
    be emptied as per respective council’s schedule, it may affect the environment.
    Although there are different color codes for the bins for the segregation of waste
    items at the source in Australia, e.g., a Red-lidded container is for nonrecyclable
    household rubbish and is collected weekly. The yellow-lidded bin is for recyclable
    items collected fortnightly, and the green-lidded bin is for garden cuttings and
    is also collected fortnightly. Nevertheless, it has been observed that people
    may not follow the color codes and throw unwanted items in different bins, such
    as batteries, toxic materials, medical waste, and fast decaying food items, including
    fruits and meat products. Hence, we recommend using digital technologies to; reduce
    costs and resource consumption, identify objects in the waste for faster response,
    overall improved performance, and social well-being with increased engagement.
    In this context, the smart waste management system architecture is shown in Fig.8.
    All the waste bins placed at various locations are intelligent bins equipped with
    IoT sensors that continuously monitor the volume [133], [134] and the type of
    objects in the waste. As soon as a bin is ninety percent full, or a rotting, fast
    decaying, or a toxic thing is thrown in the bin, an alert message is generated
    containing the location of the bin, time, volume, and type of the waste to the
    waste management controller (located at STP waste management office). The controller
    automatically compiles the data from all the waste collection points in the STP.
    After processing the received data, the waste management app generates the dynamic
    route and schedule for daily waste collection. Any impromptu task of waste collection
    on an urgent basis is also automatically added to the specific waste collection
    vehicle route. Keeping in view the use of autonomous vehicles in the STP, it is
    presumed that the complete waste collection process is autonomous, comprising
    smart bins, driver-less vehicles, and intelligent app. The waste management system
    is envisaged to perform necessary data processing to dynamically create waste
    collection routes and schedules and propose an appropriate recycling plan. However,
    the only foreseeable challenge in successfully implementing the smart waste management
    system is the effective classification of objects in the waste. Although many
    solutions have been proposed in this regard, [135]–[138], yet considerable research
    is required to develop a real-world product. FIGURE 6. Use cases of robots in
    a smart community. Show All FIGURE 7. Intelligent street light (iLight). Show
    All FIGURE 8. Waste management system architecture. Show All 5) Intelligent Safety
    and Security System The vision of a STP as a living science city cannot be accomplished
    unless an autonomous security and safety system is deployed to intelligently protect
    against conventional security threats and reduce the impact of natural calamities
    and man-made disasters. An autonomous and intelligent security and safety system
    has the following necessary attributes. A wide network of surveillance cameras
    with image processing capabilities for real-time incident detection, face recognition,
    alarm generation, immediate response, and follow-up monitoring based on the analysis
    of live video/surveillance cameras feed. The surveillance system based on CCTV
    cameras can be supplemented by incorporating drones and robots in the security
    and monitoring mechanism. Use of iProvost (robotic police) for surveillance, incident
    detection, and initial response. The robots equipped with armor protection, cameras,
    acoustic sensors, speakers, searchlights, sirens, and blue and red flashing lights
    can be deployed at all public places, including parks, shopping malls, sports
    grounds, science park residential and commercial areas, car parks, bus/train stations,
    public libraries, etc. The robots should be able to operate autonomously on the
    predefined routes, generate an alarm, and preserve any onsite evidence (video,
    pictures, handheld objects, etc.). The essentials of an iProvost’s job profile
    include detection of road-rage, street fights/crimes, bullying at public places,
    carjacking, illegal travel on bus and train without a ticket, shoplifting, etc.
    The robots can also identify criminals using facial recognition and help find
    family/guardians of lost kids or senior citizens. Safety of science park against
    natural/man-made disasters based on environmental monitoring and issuance of related
    warnings and precautionary/remedial measures. The sensors may include seismic
    sensors, fire/smoke detectors, and an automated flood warning system. 6) Drones
    as a Service (DaaS) In today’s dynamic and eventful world, the requirement of
    speedy response to various social service requests has been made easy by drone
    technologies. Nonetheless, most of the current drone applications are centered
    around a service-based business model. However, as per the existing regulatory
    frameworks e.g., drone policy outlined by Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA)
    Australia [139], limited commercial use of drones or Remotely Piloted Aircraft
    (RPA) is allowed under strict standing operating conditions for micro and small
    excluded category RPA. Small excluded category RPA involving drones weighing no
    more than 25 Kilograms is only applicable to private landowners. Some of the other
    conditions that restrict an all-out commercial use of drone technology include
    no flying within 5.5 Km of an airport with a control tower. The drone should not
    go beyond 120 m from the operator. No drones should be flown in an area with emergency
    operations underway. Hence, the above discussion concludes that the future STPs
    should seek some leverage from the respective government in the commercial use
    of drones within the park premises. Thereby, the STPs may use drones to inspect
    industrial equipment or construction sites, surveillance and security services,
    cargo delivery, land surveying, and farming operations. It is also proposed that
    a STP should workout a customized drone use policy as a test case for the provision
    of various autonomous drone-based services and try new business models in a realistic
    urban environment under centralized control. To deliberate further on the concept
    of DaaS, some of the proposed applications, as shown in Fig.9 are illustrated
    in succeeding paragraphs: Inspection and Surveying Services: Inspection/observation
    service may include rooftop condition assessment, land surveying, construction
    site monitoring, gas/water pipe leakage detection and assessment, and other HAZMAT
    leakage detection or monitoring. Emergency Response: It can include different
    scenarios, e.g., in the case of a traffic accident, drone-based service may be
    used for first responder damage assessment, evidence gathering for insurance purposes,
    and road/traffic assessment to regulate traffic on alternate routes. Concerning
    health emergency response, park residents may sign up with the STP health emergency
    response service indicating desired medicines or medical equipment. Therefore,
    once the affected person or his nominated close contact triggers an alarm for
    immediate requirement of a specific medication or medical equipment such as EpiPen,
    inhaler, defibrillator, insulin, Ventolin, anti spider/snake venom, etc., a drone
    is dispatched to make the delivery. Disaster Response and Relief Management: Disaster
    response and management is a critical task that requires speedy situational awareness
    for a targeted and effective response. E.g., in case of natural/man-made disasters,
    including bushfire, earthquake, flood, or severe storms, autonomous drones can
    be used to assess the extent of damage caused by the calamity, monitor rescue
    and relief efforts, and also provide food and necessary supplies to the affectees.
    There are drone technologies that can assist in fire fighting efforts in areas
    inaccessible to humans. Correspondingly, drones can provide early warning of flash
    floods by visual surveillance of waterways and reservoirs. Delivery Services:
    It is perceived that most stakeholders tend to engage in time constraint activities
    in the science park environment. They may require some essential equipment, IT
    parts, tools, small packages, or food and grocery items on an urgent basis. Hence,
    the drone delivery service’s on-demand nature will allow shipments to be sent
    as soon as they are ready rather than waiting for the following day’s shipping
    run. The drones can thus ensure swift fulfillment of time-critical scheduled as
    well as spontaneous deliveries. In this regard, users may be charged an extra
    amount depending upon the urgency/priority of delivery. Telepresence: Another
    compelling use case of DaaS business model is telepresence. This service can assist
    STP residents in supervising various tasks remotely. E.g., Walking kids home from
    school if their nanny is not available that day. The kids’ parents can view the
    real-time video footage of the drone to see their kids going home. Similarly,
    if a person is busy at work and wants to check on his kid at a soccer game remotely,
    the DaaS app will provide him the opportunity to request such a service by entering
    the date, time, and location of the event. Correspondingly, a drone can also be
    hired to search and locate a lost pet. Research Support: Research scientists,
    startups, and other parties can book a drone flight to test a new sensing technology
    or a flight control mechanism. Similarly, university students can also hire standard
    drones to test various intelligent applications. Challenges: Like other autonomous
    systems, DaaS business model also has associated challenges. E.g., A bad weather
    environment, including thunderstorms or strong winds, may disrupt drone flights,
    especially for the small RPAs. Similarly, in a large drone fleet, it would be
    an arduous task to monitor and manage drone flight paths, scheduled and spontaneous
    task assignments, and prioritizing the jobs based on user-specific response time.
    Besides, the urban environment and integral obstacles may adversely affect drone
    flight paths. Likewise, transitioning from fully outdoor to semi-indoor operation
    may affect the performance of on-board GPS. Hence, an improved drone localization
    algorithm needs to be developed to provide cm-level accuracy in the absence of
    GPS service. Correspondingly, there is a need to create a flight management system
    with the capability of flight schedule, flight path mapping and analysis, data
    analytics for proactive/predictive maintenance, and drone abstraction that involves
    working with multiple drone providers. FIGURE 9. Drones as a service (DaaS) use
    cases. Show All 7) Smart Governance and Management Autonomous Resource Management
    System (ARMS): It refers to monitoring and managing all types of resources in
    the STPs. E.g., as shown in Fig.10, to facilitate research, innovation, and collaboration
    between various stakeholders, we introduce ARMS. The suggested system will monitor
    the status of all the projects undertaken by startups, tech-based firms, and entrepreneurs.
    It keeps a record of organizations’ resource requirements, including equipment
    and a skilled workforce. Similarly, it will connect with the industry partners
    to track their R&D needs, funding options, and expertise/specialized equipment
    on the inventory. In the same way, the ARMS will monitor and maintain data on
    HEIs’ research interests, skilled human resources, the requirement of funds, grants
    in progress, specialized equipment, and laboratories. HEIs’ incubation capabilities
    will also be monitored along with data on academic literature, government policies,
    and regulations. Correspondingly, the system will maintain and manage the availability
    of equipment and skilled workforce at specialized laboratories. Hence, when an
    organization requires some equipment or a skilled workforce, ARMS can provide
    the desired information and do the requisite coordination. Moreover, if an organization
    requires HEIs’ support for a research project, then ARMS can facilitate the submission
    of Expression of Interests (EoIs). Besides, ARMS will also provide updates on
    patents and innovative technologies to all stakeholders in the STP. Smart IP and
    Copyrights Management: IP and copyrights management is a critical affair in academics
    and the tech world. Hence, it is proposed that ARMS being connected to all the
    stakeholders can easily monitor and detect any IP and copyrights violation not
    only within the STP but also with any other organization globally (based on resources
    available on the internet). Autonomous Fleet and Construction Site Management:
    Most of the time, construction sites present a scene of the hustle and bustle
    with heavy machinery moving in and out of the site. Due to the involvement of
    heavy trucks, giant construction machines, and massive construction materials,
    the safety and management of men and material is an arduous task. However, today
    autonomous hardware and software-based applications have made the job easy. For
    instance, researchers in [140] introduced the concept of Smart Construction Objects
    SCO) to enable a safer, greener, efficient, and cost-effective construction system.
    SCOs are the construction resources or materials that can be made autonomous and
    smart by harnessing them with requisite capabilities such as sensing, actuating,
    networking, computing, and data processing. Subsequently, the ability of SCOs
    to interact/talk to each other results in increased awareness and more autonomous
    decision-making without human intervention. E.g., a smart tower crane can communicate
    with a smart steel column to find its weight and potential safety hazards before
    lifting it. Hence, SCOs provide decision-making information to human decision-makers
    and make rule-based decisions autonomously themselves. Therefore, construction
    companies can now remotely manage the fleet of heavy vehicles, do load balancing,
    estimate future stock requirements, and carry out trip planning [141]. In this
    regard, we propose an Autonomous Construction Fleet and Site Management (AFCSM)
    service. As shown in Fig.11, AFCSM comprises various applications. For instance,
    eTrack provides GPS-based real-time asset location information via 4G/LTE. Similarly,
    the Road Traffic Management (RTM) app collects road usage data from vehicles through
    onboard sensing devices. RTM thus facilitates the movement of large vehicles by
    monitoring vehicle loads and road conditions. It can also ensure compliance with
    environmental and safety standards by generating an alarm in case of any violation.
    Correspondingly, vehicle telemetrics plays a vital role in managing a large fleet
    of vehicles [142]. Hence, the Vehicle Telemetrics Application (VTA) continuously
    performs vehicles’ diagnostics and generates early warnings. It can also initiate
    collision and breakdown notifications. Subsequently, an emergency call is automatically
    made for a rapid response in case of an accident. VTA may also report/share the
    location of the vehicle in case of a theft. Also, to assist the organizations
    in fleet management, VTA can perform vehicle diagnostics to optimize maintenance
    and fuel consumption and ensure driver and vehicle safety. AFCSM offers another
    compelling feature of freight priority in which the customer organizations can
    prioritize delivery of the freight/construction material as per their schedule
    or to meet an urgent requirement. The customers registered with AFCSM can access
    a range of information about their fleet and construction sites. The users can
    see live asset location, asset trip record (including history, routes, and load),
    vehicle safety, and breakdown event notifications. The AFCSM dashboard may also
    show information about an organization’s assets being used on-site, the available
    space, and the upcoming scheduled deliveries. Thus facilitating the customers
    in the efficient management of their stocks. We believe that AFCSM will improve
    fleet management, reduce maintenance costs, safety risks, and liabilities. AFCSM
    can also make use of geofencing to monitor fleet activity and identify abnormal
    driver behavior. In addition, by real-time asset tracking, AFCSM will facilitate
    road safety and infrastructure management, e.g., once a heavy vehicle, such as
    a prime mover, is entering a narrow road, other personal and commercial vehicles
    are shifted to alternate routes. Autonomous System for Workers’ Safety: It is
    not surprising that construction sites and other industries involving heavy machinery
    and vehicles are full of potential hazards. Especially during summer, due to long
    working hours and temperatures exceeding forty degrees Celsius, the construction
    workers may lose focus on their surroundings. Hence, distracted workers working
    at dangerous heights or moving around heavy machinery and equipment along with
    unaware drivers are prone to life-threatening risks. As a result, the risk of
    injury in a construction site due to collision with site vehicles, falling from
    heights, and run-over by plant machinery is significant. As per Safe Work Australia
    [143], there have been 158 deaths at work in 2020. And the top industries in these
    work-related deaths include transport/warehouse, agriculture, and construction.
    Hence, we propose an intelligent safety service named “Safe@Work”. Based on the
    solution proposed in [144], [145], Safe@Work system may consist of three main
    components. First is the sensing unit that is installed to the rear of the vehicles
    or heavy machinery. It comprises three 868 MHz Radio Frequency (RF) transceivers,
    three directional antennas, three 40 kHz ultrasonic sensors, a processor, and
    a monitoring app. The second component is the alert device (a wearable device)
    that consists of a radio transceiver, an RF wake-up sensor, and an alarm/vibrator
    actuator. Whereas the third component includes a cloud server and safety monitoring,
    and data analytics dashboard. As shown in Fig.12, to prevent vehicle backover
    accidents, the sensing unit installed at the back of the vehicles or heavy machinery
    starts functioning as soon as the vehicle is put into reverse gear. Hence, when
    a worker wearing the alert device enters the sensing unit’s coverage area, the
    alert device is powered up by the RF wake-up sensor. Otherwise, the alert device
    remains in power save (idle) mode. Soon after the alert device is activated, it
    sends an acknowledgment (ack) message to the sensing unit along with its unique
    identity (ID). All the three RF transceivers in the sensing unit receive the ack
    message with varying Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) values. The processor
    analyzes the RSSI values and accordingly instructs the respective ultrasonic sensor
    to measure the worker’s distance in the direction of the highest RSSI value. If
    the measured distance is within the prescribed dangerous zone, e.g., four meters,
    then as a warning, an alarm/vibrator activation signal is sent to the worker’s
    alert device. Moreover, the worker’s location with respect to the vehicle (based
    on distance and angle) is also shown on the driver’s monitoring app. Similarly,
    sensing units can be installed at various hazardous locations within a STP to
    alert the workers and prevent any untoward incident. These locations may include
    big dug-outs, deep pits, unprotected rooftops, freshly laid concrete or charcoal
    area, HAZMAT, or a busy work zone involving heavy machinery. FIGURE 10. Autonomous
    resource management system (ARMS). Show All FIGURE 11. Autonomous fleet and construction
    site management. Show All FIGURE 12. Safe@Work system. Show All 8) STP Data Arena
    Based on the concept of “Data Lakes,” we propose STP Data Arena, a data as a service
    business model that aims to overcome organizational boundaries and system complexities
    involved in data sharing. Illustrating a data lake, James Dixon in [146] referred
    to it as a large body of water in a natural state which requires further cleansing
    and processing to be useful. On the contrary, this paper proffers STP Data Arena
    to be a more refined and user-ready application. As shown in Fig.13, raw data
    from each autonomous system database (DB) is extracted and moved to STP Data Arena.
    The raw data may include any type or size of data, e.g., sensors data, user interaction
    logs, images or video libraries, structured or semi-structured data (JSON, Avro,
    Parquet, etc.), and snapshots of autonomous systems’ DB. The data ingestion can
    be done through Apache Sqoop that bulk loads (pull) relational data to Hadoop
    Distributed File System (HDFS) [147]. HDFS is a distributed file system designed
    to store big data and stream those data sets at high bandwidth to user applications
    [148], [149]. Similarly, to ingest batched or streaming data into the STP Data
    Arena, scalable message ques (Kafka [150]) and data stream engines such as Samza
    [151], or Spark streaming [152] can be used. However, as data is stored in Data
    Arena in the original format, the inconsistent and incomplete data pose a problem
    of data integration for the data scientists [153]. Therefore, data scientists
    must carefully prepare the data, including data profiling and integration, before
    the analytical results are extracted. FIGURE 13. STP Data Arena business model.
    Show All However, HDFS is believed to have numerous system administration challenges
    related to data replication, adding nodes, creating directories and partitions,
    performance, workload management, data (re-)distribution, etc. [154]. Furthermore,
    HDFS has minimal core security tools, thus often requiring add-ons. Moreover,
    disaster recovery is another significant problem. Nonetheless Snowflake [155]
    resolves above-mentioned problems. Snowflake data cloud eliminates storage management
    concerns by ousting the need to set up and manage nodes, define file systems or
    directories, and implement and revise data distribution policies. Besides, Snowflake
    provides data replication, backup, and disaster recovery as an integral part of
    managed services. In addition, Snowflake employs end-to-end encryption to ensure
    user data security at rest and in transit [156]. The ultimate objective here is
    to drive value from the raw data by exploring and transforming original data and
    training statistical models to be used in various services/applications. E.g.,
    based on data uploaded by the DaaS system, the data scientists can extract the
    peak time for various drone-based services such as the type of deliveries, i.e.,
    food or packages, the kind of drone used, i.e., delivery or inspection. Hence,
    a careful analysis can reveal users’ preferences for drone services at a particular
    time of day, peak hours for each type of drone service, users’ food choices, most
    popular restaurants, etc. The processed data/results will help the DaaS management
    optimize drone scheduling and flight paths as per peak hours of various drone
    services. Similarly, the restaurants can prepare the popular food items in appropriate
    quantity at peak hours to reduce delivery time for their customers. Similarly,
    analysis of data ingested by the smart living system may infer the STP tenants’
    usage pattern of various appliances/utilities in a smart home. Hence, the manufacturers
    can use the processed data to improve predictive maintenance or optimize various
    utilities’ load/availability. In the same way, data available from real-time autonomous
    systems can help stakeholders in statistical analysis, customized marketing campaigns,
    or improved services. Moreover, by collecting data in STP Data Arena, different
    sources’ data can be correlated without crossing system or organizational boundaries.
    E.g., the data generated by various research centers can be correlated with the
    industry’s technological challenges. This will help the analysts or STP management
    in understanding whether the current research at the science park is aligned with
    real-world challenges or not. In addition, STP Data Arena infrastructure should
    be accessible to nontechnical users, i.e., self-service analytics or enterprise
    applications. Furthermore, to prevent the storage of garbage data in the data
    arena, there is a need for a data governance process to control what goes into
    the data arena and how it is shared. Correspondingly, a well-placed governance
    model will ensure data quality, security, privacy, and accountability. 9) Additional
    Services In addition to ASaaS, this research also proposes a couple of unconventional
    services and 3D modeling and printing as a supporting service to facilitate STP
    tenants. a: Tech Think Tank as a Service (3TaaS) Augmenting the support provided
    to the new firms and businesses in the form of incubators and business support
    by the STP management, we propose 3TaaS, a think tank as a service. The 3TaaS
    is supposed to be a technology research policy institute comprising representatives
    from academia, industry, research centers, and enterprises. The think tank will
    analyze the industry’s overall technology needs, future technologies, and current
    orientation of research in the STP to advocate new research ideas. Such an arrangement
    is expected to promote innovation and make the respective STP a leader in developing
    new technologies while solving real-world industry/tech problems. b: 3D Urban
    Archaeology According to Archaeological Institute of America [157], archaeology
    is the scientific excavation and study of ancient human material remains. Similarly,
    urban archaeology is defined as the application of archaeological methods to the
    study of cities and the process of urbanization [158], [159]. Based on the concept
    of urban archaeology, we propose a 3D STP Archaeology Service, i.e., time-lagged
    history of the STP evolution/development. The main features of this service are:
    It allows for evaluation of past design decisions that may affect future investments
    in a STP. It provides a rich source of data to improve future designs by identifying
    mistakes in the past projects. Provides macro and micro-level views of a STP site
    development on a timeline. It is a chronology of the complete development process
    of every building on the site. Contains a record of the development process, including
    pictures, materials used, workforce employed, supervisors, builders, and architects
    on the job. It will assist in auditability, transparency of processes, future
    reference, and assessment of compliance with regulations/standards. c: 3D Modelling,
    Scanning and Printing Laboratory Today, there is a multitude of diverse 3D printing
    technologies that can manufacture objects using a vast array of materials. These
    materials range from thermoplastics and polymers to metal, and micro-fluids, which
    are capable of fulfilling most engineering and design needs [160]. Hence, a 3D
    modeling, scanning, and printing laboratory is recommended in STPs to facilitate
    researchers and startups in the swift design and manufacturing of essential components
    or product parts. D. Integration of Autonomous Systems Advances in Sensors and
    Actuators Network Environment (SANE) have provided an opportunity to integrate
    multiple autonomous systems. As shown in Fig.14, different autonomous systems
    may have a wholly distinct or shared infrastructure. E.g., At some locations in
    a STP, especially the areas with road network, the smart environment system may
    rely on the sensors installed on iLights. Similarly, the iSecurity and Safety
    system or DaaS may depend on the information received from personal, social, and
    service robots for search and rescue or an emergency response operation. The data
    generated by autonomous systems’ sensors and other devices such as surveillance
    cameras, robots, intelligent traffic management, iBuildings, or iLights is received
    or routed by multi-protocol gateway devices installed in SANE nodes available
    throughout the STPs at strategic locations. The end-devices and sensing equipment
    mostly communicate with the gateway devices using LoRaWAN, WiFi, or NBIoT technologies.
    Whereas the back-haul communication to link IoT layer with data orchestration
    layer primarily supports 5G, optical fiber, Gigabit Ethernet (GbE), or satellite
    technologies. Besides, the data orchestration layer comprises the autonomous systems’
    DBs, STP Data Arena, data processing, and analytics infrastructure, and requisite
    data services. Moreover, the data orchestration layer further feeds the data to
    the application layer that comprises an STP ASaaS dashboard. The dashboard provides
    an interface to the autonomous systems applications and offers essential statistics
    and selected real-time data streams. FIGURE 14. Autonomous systems as a service
    (ASaaS) - network architecture. Show All In addition, there are certain aspects
    that may drive the methodology of integrating different systems: Autonomous systems’
    relationships, networks and security, may dictate how data is exchanged between
    different systems [161]–[164]. STP autonomous systems’ dashboard be designed to
    better support the end-users by providing understandable, flexible and trustworthy
    services [165]. Efficient coordination is essential between multiple systems with
    different objectives. And the same can be provided via a centralized or distributed
    approach [166]. Ethics, regulations, and standards should be complied with for
    ethical, reliable, and safe performance of autonomous systems [167]–[169]. 1)
    Kevin - a STP Tenant’s Case Study To better understand the potential of ASaaS,
    let us visualize a day in the life of Kevin, an entrepreneur, and an STP tenant.
    Today, he has an important presentation to a VC at 4 pm. But before that, he has
    to collect and assemble a prototype of his new IoT device by 9 am. So that he
    can include some actual results about device’s operation in his presentation.
    Kevin lives in an autonomous smart home that intelligently and independently controls
    all the functions in the house. E.g., at night, all the lights and the HVAC vents
    are switched off in the unoccupied rooms. The smart home controller “iAssist”
    regulates all the operations as per Kevin’s habits and personal preferences. Correspondingly,
    over the period, the iAssist learns that Kevin likes to run the ceiling fan at
    medium speed in his room if the ambient temperature is less than or equal to twenty
    degrees Celsius. Hence, the iAssist keeps the air conditioner switched off. Moreover,
    iAssist ensures that Kevin wakes up at the right time to reach his workplace in
    time. In this regard, iAssist accesses data from the STP Data Arena to estimate
    the expected travel time based on current weather and traffic conditions. Unfortunately,
    due to yesterday evening’s storm, there are a few road blockades. Hence, based
    on real-time traffic data extracted from the STP Data Arena, iAssist predicts
    that it will take fifteen minutes more than the usual travel time. Thus, it sets
    Kevin’s alarm clock to trigger at 7:15 am instead of 7:30 am every day. Accordingly,
    the iAssist switches on the HVAC in the ensuite at 7:10 am to regulate the temperature
    to twenty degrees Celsius, and the light in the room is switched on as the alarm
    is set off. To conserve energy, all the lights are also controlled through motion
    sensors. Hence, the light in the ensuite switches on as Kevin walks in. Usually,
    Kevin takes thirty minutes to get ready and reach the kitchen for breakfast. Therefore,
    keeping an eye on the shower, iAssist switches on the coffee machine at 7:41 am
    so that when Kevin comes to the kitchen at 7:46 am, the coffee is ready at Kevin’s
    desired temperature. As soon as Kevin gets his bread out of the toaster, iAssist
    orders an autonomous cab for 8 am so that Kevin reaches his office by 8:15 am
    with sufficient time to collect and assemble his IoT device. iAssist also alerts
    Kevin to take his routine medicines and vitamins after breakfast. However, just
    two minutes before the arrival of the autonomous cab, Kevin realizes that he had
    to buy a new lounger for his living room today as it was the last day of the sale.
    But his 4 pm meeting leaves him no time to visit the furniture outlet. Hence,
    he immediately opens up the iShopping app on the STP ASaaS dashboard, visually
    performs a final inspection of the lounger for his living room, and places an
    order for delivery at 6:30 pm. Once Kevin leaves for work, his wife Sophia prepares
    for her “Chef@Home” a home-cooked food delivery business. Because of the on-park
    autonomous vertical farms, it is pretty easy for Sofia to organize her daily cooking
    and preparation of orders. She receives fresh produce and groceries every morning
    through an autonomous cab. In contrast, all the packaging and consumables are
    delivered from suppliers in the city by delivery drones. Sofia mostly provides
    food at lunchtime to STP offices, and in the evening, the great bulk of her food
    is delivered to people’s homes using DaaS. She does not even need to know the
    customers’ personal details. All that is required is customers’ location code
    from their phone when they place the order, and the system takes care of the rest.
    However, in the midst of her work, Sofia realized that today her eight-year-old
    daughter Bella’s school would close early, but she cannot leave her work due to
    an urgent order. Although the school is in the near vicinity, and she believes
    that Bella can quickly get home. However, still as a worried mother, she requests
    a telepresence drone using her STP app by entering the school location and her
    daughter’s STP digital ID. Now, she can easily monitor her daughter walking to
    the home via live streaming through the DaaS system. On the other hand, en-route
    to his office, Kevin realized that the autonomous cab had taken a diversion from
    the usual route. Upon checking the real-time 3D map of STP, Kevin finds out a
    small accident on the other road a few minutes before. As a result, the nearby
    iLighting system detected and escalated the incident so that all the traffic is
    autonomously diverted to the alternate routes shown on the map. As soon as Kevin
    glances away from his smartphone, suddenly, a cyclist brushes past the side of
    the car. Although it is just a minor scratch, however still to record the incident
    and fulfill insurance formalities within three minutes of the incident; an inspection
    drone arrives and takes the mishap’s visual evidence. Moreover, the cyclist also
    got a minor scuff mark on his leg and was immediately provided medical aid through
    an emergency response drone. Despite a couple of untoward events, Kevin reaches
    his office well in time to work on the IoT device. But there is one discrepancy,
    a part supposed to come with the device is missing. Kevin immediately logs into
    the DaaS’s parcel tracking and location system, which tracks the parcels through
    RFID tags. He finds that the package was incorrectly addressed and delivered to
    another company on the other side of the park in error. It is 10 am, and the DaaS
    system has already identified the mistake and arranged for the parcel to be collected
    and delivered to the correct address. Finally, Kevin gets the part, and he starts
    working on his presentation to finish it by 3 pm. By then, Kevin realizes that
    it is difficult for him to go for a late lunch to his favorite restaurant, with
    the meeting starting in an hour. So he places an order for office delivery. Kevin
    has a severe peanut allergy. Even small quantities of peanuts can lead to anaphylactic
    shock, which can be life-threatening. Therefore, he always carries an EpiPen as
    a precaution. However, due to the scheduled meeting in mind, he forgot to bring
    the EpiPen today. To his bad luck, the restaurant uses breadcrumbs from a new
    supplier and is less careful about peanut contamination. Therefore, after a few
    bites of his favourite chicken schnitzel, he starts feeling the allergic reaction.
    He searches his bag for his EpiPen and is alarmed to find it is not there. Fortunately,
    he has subscribed to the STP’s EpiPen Service and quickly uses the app on his
    phone to trigger an alarm. The system immediately dispatches a drone with an EpiPen
    to Kevin’s location. The EpiPen arrives in three minutes, and Kevin gets a lifesaving
    dose of Epinephrine. It took ten minutes for Kevin to recover from the allergy
    attack, but he finally got better. Later, at 4 pm, he made a successful presentation
    to the VC. However, during the presentation, the VC team was a bit skeptical about
    the idea’s IP rights. However, Kevin directed the team to verify the new concept’s
    IP and copyrights from the ARMS app available on the STP ASaaS dashboard. Once
    validated, VC bought the pitch and showed interest in funding the project. After
    the rewarding meeting, Kevin left his office at 5:15 pm in an autonomous cab to
    his home. On the way home, Kevin was thinking of spending a good evening with
    his family. Suddenly, it came like a shock to him that today is his anniversary.
    Just like most of the good husbands, he had forgotten the critical day. Now it
    was too late to go to the mall and buy a gift. Thanks to the STP autonomous technologies,
    Kevin opened the iShopping app and, using his wife’s full body picture, selected
    a beautiful dress for her and placed the order for the dress to be delivered to
    his home at 6 pm. Once Kevin reached home, luckily, his wife had taken their daughter
    to the swimming class. So Kevin received the dress and the delivery of the lounger
    at 6 pm and 6:30 pm, respectively. Moreover, as a surprise for his wife, he made
    a dinner booking using the STP ASaaS app, and while selecting the food items,
    he was proposed dishes based on his allergies. Once they left for dinner, the
    smart home activated its security apparatus, switched off all unwanted lights
    and HVAC vents, and the personal robot started taking care of their pet dog. Using
    the STP ASaaS app, Kevin could always watch the personal robot’s video stream
    to check on their pet and monitor their house. Thanks to the autonomous systems,
    Kevin survived another day. SECTION IV. Data Security and Privacy in Autonomous
    Systems A. Threats to Autonomous Systems AI-based autonomous systems process every
    type of user/environmental data for intelligent decision-making. Hence, they are
    a potential threat to user data security and privacy [170]. Similarly, the pervasive
    use of Online Social Networks (OSN) and smart devices has led to the collection
    and processing of users’ data by different OSN platforms, smart city control center,
    or various other smart city components such as Intelligent Transportation Systems
    (ITS), e-governance, health, and emergency response, smart homes, etc. In return,
    these entities provide various services to the users and third parties based on
    personal choices, interests, and current location. However, the point of concern
    here is that most OSNs and smart city systems have centralized control over users’
    data. Hence, they risk a single point of failure in case of a cyber-attack, or
    other technical malfunctions [171]. Moreover, this arrangement also has trust
    issues, as the users have to trust the entity that is handling their data. Hence,
    data owners have no control over their data assets [172] as they do not know where
    their data is stored, what is happening to it, who has access to it and is there
    any unauthorized disclosure to the third parties [173]. Before we further explore
    data security and privacy, it is essential to illustrate security and privacy
    terminologies. In this regard, data security is referred to as confidentiality
    of data, i.e., data protection from unauthorized disclosure. Whereas data privacy
    does not have a universal definition, it may differ from person to person according
    to individual preferences [172]. According to [174], when the confidentiality
    property of a system is breached, i.e., unauthorized users get access to confidential
    data, then the privacy breach also occurs if the disclosed data contains someone’s
    personal information. Similarly, [175] describes privacy as “the claim of individuals,
    groups, or institutions to determine for themselves when, how, and to what extent
    information about them is communicated to others.” Another definition [176] interprets
    privacy as “an individual’s ability to exercise control over the collection, use,
    and dissemination of his/her Personally Identifiable Information (PII).” Where
    PII is any piece of information that distinguishes or helps to trace a person’s
    identity, such as his name, social security number, insurance policy number, biometric
    records, etc. Hence, privacy issues arise with the collection, processing, and
    disclosure of PII. Moreover, researchers in [177] claim that privacy is difficult
    to achieve in today’s environment of intensive surveillance and monitoring technologies,
    including CCTV, RFID, IoT, data mining and profiling, ubiquitous computing, and
    ambient intelligence. Further, delineating threats to IoT-based Agri tech, [178]
    classify the threat models into five main categories, including attacks against
    privacy, authentication, confidentiality, availability, and integrity properties.
    Correspondingly, as shown in Fig.15, autonomous systems collect varying information
    about people. E.g., health information, smart home data, food choices, travel
    habits, research interests, personal skills, financial data, etc. According to
    [179], personal information is collected by two methods, i.e., surveillance and
    interrogation. Surveillance refers to the automatic collection of data by autonomous
    systems, e.g., autonomous cars collecting information about routes taken, time-stamped
    locations, distance, and destinations. Also, smart surveillance systems watch
    every move of people. Whereas in interrogation, systems actively ask the users
    for specific data. E.g., the iHealth system asking a user for existing health
    conditions and medications for data analytics or timely emergency response. Now
    the collection of information through surveillance and interrogation can be controlled
    to some extent by system designers by conforming to the privacy statement or privacy
    policies. However, there may be challenges for fully autonomous systems. These
    systems may start collecting new information that was not supposed to be collected,
    E.g., autonomous cars start recording people’s private conversations during a
    ride. FIGURE 15. Autonomous systems’ security evaluation. Show All Similarly,
    another activity during which user data may be subjected to security and privacy
    breaches is information processing. It involves the use or transformation of collected
    data. Data can be used or processed in many ways. Such as data aggregation, which
    refers to studying different pieces of data about an individual to predict his
    future behavior accurately. E.g., aggregating users’ travel data consisting of
    travel time, destinations, distance travel, and waypoints to predict his future
    destination or travel distance. Similarly, an iHealth system may predict an individual’s
    estimated life span based on his health history, medications, and lifestyle (eating
    and exercise habits). Such a piece of information may affect users’ insurance
    policies/claims. Hence, a scenario where an autonomous system has more information
    about a person than the person knows himself is termed as “Inverse Privacy” [180].
    In addition to data aggregation, identification [179] is another data processing
    action in which a person is uniquely identified based on his real-world ID. E.g.,
    if autonomous cars and smart surveillance systems start identifying and proactively
    recording data about all the people moving around. In such a case, people will
    not have any privacy of their movement, location, and usual activities. Sequel
    to data collection and processing, data storage, and management is another critical
    function that may affect data security and privacy. As shown in Fig.15 all the
    data collected and processed by autonomous systems in STP is stored in the respective
    autonomous system DB and also in STP Data Arena. The most significant requirement
    at this stage is that personal data should be protected against security breaches
    while it is kept in a traditional DB or a data lake. Hence, there is a need for
    secure autonomous systems. However, due to the complex nature of autonomous systems,
    and high-connectivity, they are vulnerable to hacking, and other cyber threats
    [181]. In addition, often due to service level agreements (SLA), the developers
    of autonomous systems have remote access to the deployed systems for troubleshooting
    or other maintenance tasks. Hence, it is highly probable that they have full access
    to respective autonomous system components, including user data, which may be
    a severe security and privacy threat. Therefore, service-level access should be
    carefully assessed and authorized. Similarly, data sharing between different autonomous
    systems should also be carefully planned and executed. Security and privacy of
    data must be ensured by design, and authorizations should be granted based on
    the principle of “Least Privilege” [182] i.e., people, systems, and processes
    should have access to only those resources (networks, systems, and files) that
    are absolutely necessary to perform their assigned function. E.g., DaaS may have
    access to the MaaS system to coordinate hand over and delivery of packages in
    case of inclement weather. Or DaaS may access data of aFaaS to spot and monitor
    livestock. Similarly, DaaS can access iSecurity and Safety system for various
    search, rescue and relief efforts. Hence, DaaS may have many different levels
    of privilege with other autonomous systems on mutual trust. However, every system/organization
    must ensure that each trust relationship is granted minimal privileges to perform
    a particular task. B. Data Security and Privacy Measures Security of any system
    is derived by some policy and regulatory controls. Subsequently, in the case of
    an IT system, the technical controls are designed and developed to comply with
    respective organization’s or country’s policies/regulations. According to Australian
    Privacy Principles (APP) [183], every individual has the right to decide how his
    personal (that identifies his identity) and sensitive information (personal opinion,
    choices, biometrics, etc.) is handled. Hence, any organization covered under the
    Australian Privacy Act 1988 (including all the amendments) [58], is bound to manage
    users’ personal information in a transparent way with a clearly expressed privacy
    policy. Correspondingly, every user has the right to know that: what kind of personal
    details the respective entity collects and holds, how the entity collects and
    stores that information, and the purposes for which the entity collects, maintains,
    uses, and discloses personal information. Moreover, the act also directs that
    users’ sensitive information must have a higher level of privacy protection than
    other data. Therefore, concerned parties must take reasonable steps to ensure
    confidentiality, integrity, and availability of personal data. Also, in some cases,
    personal information/data should be destroyed or de-identified. In the same way,
    [170] emphasizes that protecting user privacy is the first line of defense against
    various cyber-attacks that exploit users’ private data obtained through security
    breaches. These threats include online discrimination, phishing, identity theft,
    cyber scams, cyberstalking, cyberbullying, etc. Therefore, to preserve the privacy
    of user data, in addition to a transparent privacy policy statement, the respective
    organization/system should also hold confidentiality and integrity properties.
    In other words, any organization/system handling users’ personal data must employ
    both regulatory and technical controls to ensure data privacy. Subsequently, we
    propose a data strategy and some technical controls to ensure the security and
    privacy of STP users and tenants. 1) Data Strategy STPs must advocate compliance
    to regulatory frameworks so that system designers and developers are bound to
    design and develop privacy-preserving autonomous systems. E.g., given the Australian
    Privacy Act 1988, and European Union General Data Protection Regulation (EU GDPR)
    [184], the autonomous systems should: Collect and process personal data only with
    the consent of the data owner. Preserve user privacy by design. Gather, process,
    and use personal data/information under the instructions based on a mutual contract
    between the user and respective organization/entity. Give data owner the right
    to access the information concerning the processing of his data, i.e., which third
    parties have access to what information and how they use it. Erase users’ personal
    data immediately once it is no longer needed. Be transparent such that individuals
    know about the collection and use of their data. Make unbiased and fully autonomous
    decisions without any special considerations from the vendors or system manufacturers
    (additional regulation required). 2) Technical Controls Concerning technical controls,
    usually access to data is controlled through data encryption, authentication,
    and authorization measures [174]. Similarly, there are defined strategies to achieve
    privacy-by-design in autonomous systems [185]. Hence, the technical controls for
    security and privacy proposed in this study revolve around the following guidelines:
    Selected/particular data to be collected by the devices/autonomous systems and
    anonymization and pseudonymization techniques to hide the users’ real identity.
    Data is to be secured at rest and in transit, in combination with network traffic
    hiding techniques such as TOR [186]. Personal data must be stored and processed
    in a distributed manner, i.e., data from multiple sources about the same person
    should be stored and processed separately. So that if one DB or system is compromised,
    a complete profile of the affected users cannot be made. Use of privacy-preserving
    data aggregation techniques such as k-anonymity [187], differential-privacy [188].
    In this context, Lu et al. [189] proposed a lightweight privacy-preserving data
    aggregation solution for IoT applications, which can be applied in Agri tech.
    The proposed solution combines three cryptographic techniques: homomorphic Paillier
    encryption, the Chinese Remainder Theorem, and a one-way hash chain. These three
    techniques are used to encrypt sensor data, calculate the mean and variance of
    aggregated IoT data, and provide lightweight authentication among IoT devices.
    While using any system, the users should be informed in a transparent way about
    the information being collected and processed, how it is collected, and its purpose.
    Data owners should also be informed about the ways their data is protected. In
    addition, the users must know that with which third parties their information
    is shared. Similarly, users must be clear about their data access rights and how
    to exercise them. Users should control their data so that they can update their
    privacy settings, regulate access to their data assets, and delete data that is
    not required for any of the services the user is availing. Privacy policies based
    on legal requirements should be enforced using various access control measures.
    There should be an accountability of compliance to privacy policies using logging,
    auditing, or other techniques. Correspondingly, Fig.15 portrays the complete picture
    of autonomous systems threats and requisite security measures. For better understanding,
    follow the diagram from left to right and bottom to top. The security threats
    are shown in the red box at each layer, and related security measures are shown
    in green boxes on the opposite (right) side. It can be seen that autonomous systems
    collect different types of user data varying from dietary habits to PII, such
    as medicare ID, citizenship number, driving license number, passport number, biometrics,
    etc. However, the autonomous systems should be so designed that they should consider
    privacy norms [190] while collecting information about users to optimize respective
    service levels. Moreover, most of the systems in the real-world present complex
    privacy statements at the time of signup. Therefore, it is recommended that there
    should be a smart personal assistant [191] that should negotiate the policy statements
    and related consents on behalf of the user. Similarly, to enforce compliance to
    a mutual agreement between an autonomous system and a user, a blockchain-based
    smart contract can be used. As blockchain works on the network consensus principle,
    no individual system can modify the contract terms. Moreover, data can only be
    collected as per authorizations defined by the data owner. The data sensed and
    collected by autonomous systems infrastructure is further transported to the data
    orchestration layer through various communications protocols. The communications
    protocols may include WiFi, 5G, Optical Fiber, GbE, satellite communications,
    or LP-WAN technologies such as LoRaWAN, and NB-IoT. Nonetheless, to counter protocol-specific
    vulnerabilities that may pose a threat to data confidentiality and integrity during
    transit, it is recommended that the source devices should encrypt the data. Similarly,
    an additional user/data authentication mechanism should also be employed to ensure
    data integrity. It is also preferred that autonomous systems such as DaaS, MaaS,
    aFaaS, smart homes, and iHealth mostly comprise particular types of IoT devices.
    And these devices, usually operating independently in a trustless environment,
    are vulnerable to various threats, such as physical compromise, hacking, and code
    modification [192]. Hence, the security of IoT devices is of utmost importance.
    Therefore, it is proposed that all the devices/equipment part of an autonomous
    system that operates directly in the public place must be tamper-proofed. Also,
    there should be some mechanism to verify the integrity of IoT devices on a regular
    basis. It is evident from Fig.15 that most of the vulnerabilities emerge at the
    data orchestration layer, where data is stored, processed, managed, and shared
    with various stakeholders. Hence, to prevent various attacks, different defense
    strategies are proposed. Firstly, to prevent unauthorized access to data in the
    garb of SLAs, access to system resources should be regulated based on the principle
    of “Least Privilege.” In the same way, to avoid a single point of failure, threats
    to data availability, and trust issues, STPs can leverage blockchain-based privacy
    and integrity-preserving data sharing framework [173] that provides a distributed
    environment with decentralized control. It also empowers data owners to authorize
    access and control the time of access to their data. The data owners are given
    an incentive for sharing their data. This incentive is important to bolster maximum
    participation of people by residing and working in a data-enabled living science
    city offering numerous autonomous services that rely on users’ data for intelligent
    decision-making. Correspondingly, there have been work on various blockchain-based
    solutions for Agri tech including Blockchain-based privacy-preserving data analytics
    [193], blockchain-based distributed key management solution [194], blockchain-based
    access control solution [195], blockchain-based reputation and trust solution
    [196], blockchain-based authentication and identification solution [197], and
    blockchain-based secure SDN to prevent false data injection [198]. Furthermore,
    entrusting users with more control over their data, end-to-end encryption can
    be used to ensure data security as it is collected and transmitted by the autonomous
    systems and stored in the local DB, followed by collection and storage in the
    STP Data Arena. However, it is not easy to perform different data analytics functions
    over encrypted data. Even homomorphic encryption schemes provide limited computable
    functions. On the contrary autonomous systems need to perform complex tasks over
    data such as reasoning, planning, inferring, or learning. Hence, an alternative
    to encryption may be trusted computing, which has been quite successful for private
    multi-party learning [199]. In addition, transparency is also considered essential
    for both user privacy [200] and autonomous systems [201]. In the context of privacy,
    transparency is that data owners know how a particular system collects, processes,
    stores, and share their data. Whereas, for autonomous systems, transparency fosters
    trust between humans and respective systems by allowing humans to better understand
    the operation of autonomous systems and their decisions. However, it is comparatively
    difficult to assess transparency for autonomous systems than traditional software
    applications where mostly public disclosure of the code is enough [202]. Therefore,
    a new research area has emerged to ensure fair computations and fair machine learning
    so that the autonomous systems make unbiased decisions [203]. Another challenge
    is the balance between transparency and privacy in autonomous systems. Since transparency
    involves knowing the current state of reasoning of an autonomous system and related
    data sets, this would be acceptable unless the current state of reasoning and
    related data sets does not disclose PII [201]. Hence, to preserve users’ privacy
    by preventing disclosure of PII, it is recommended that differential privacy based
    blockchain solutions be considered [204], [205]. Besides, there are numerous security
    threats to web applications [206]. Some of the most pronounced attacks at the
    application layer and related security measures are illustrated in the following
    paragraphs: Injection Flaws: Web applications are vulnerable to Structured Query
    Language (SQL), noSQL, and Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) injection
    flaws. These attacks enable the attacker to execute some specific commands or
    have unauthorized access to data by sending malicious data as a query to the interpreter.
    Such attacks can be avoided by carefully verifying the input data. Broken Authentication
    and Access Control: Attackers can compromise passwords, keys, session tokens,
    or have unauthorized access to users’ accounts and sensitive data. Similarly,
    attackers can modify access rights due to incorrect implementation of application
    functions related to authentication, access control, and session management. However,
    these threats can be prevented by prioritizing security during the design and
    development of web applications. Subsequently, the application developers should
    employ multifactor authentication schemes, and effective access control techniques
    such as role-based or geo-location-based access control [207], [208] to regulate
    unauthorized access to the applications and sensitive data. Sensitive Data Exposure:
    Most of the time, application developers do not pay much heed to the security
    aspects [192]. As a result, many web applications and APIs do not adequately protect
    sensitive data such as financial, healthcare, and PII. Hence, attackers may modify
    or steal such unprotected sensitive data and conduct identity theft, web extortion,
    credit card fraud, or other attacks. However, sensitive data can be protected
    with sufficient authentication and access control measures, as mentioned in the
    previous paragraph. Security Misconfiguration: This is the most common security
    vulnerability in web applications. It involves insecure default configurations,
    incomplete or ad-hoc configurations, open cloud storage, misconfigured HTTP headers,
    and verbose error messages containing sensitive information. Therefore, it is
    recommended that all applications be securely configured with the compulsion of
    changing default security parameters such as usernames and passwords. Moreover,
    there must be timely security updates in case of any security breach or discovery
    of a zero-day attack. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): A successful occurrence of XSS
    attack enables an attacker to execute malicious chunks of JavaScript in victim’s
    browser. As a result, the attacker can redirect the victim to a malicious website,
    hijack the current session or deface the affected website. Such attacks can be
    prevented by making sure that any dynamic content coming from the back-end data
    store cannot be used to inject JavaScript on a web page [209]. SECTION V. Role
    of Universities in a STP Universities are the epic center of academic research,
    innovation, and generation of new ideas. According to [210], universities are
    a kind of “factory” generating new patentable products. Moreover, authors in [211],
    [212] assert that universities in a STP cause knowledge spillovers that benefit
    various stakeholders and promote the creation and exchange of technological knowledge.
    As a result of this knowledge sharing, the firms or startups at STP have the opportunity
    to improve their innovative capacity. Hence, universities attract private-sector
    organizations and other nonprofit technology research groups. However, universities
    require ways and means to turn academic research into innovative commercial products
    [9]. For this purpose, STPs should endeavor to provide the desired platform to
    the universities and private-sector research centers to play their part. In this
    context, STPs must try to enhance universities’ role with an increased cooperation/collaboration
    with industry. As shown in Fig.16 during the planning and design phase of a STP,
    universities can employ higher degree research students and respective staff members
    to conceive and prepare initial designs of different autonomous systems. The vital
    aspect here is identifying the right technologies and related products to sustain
    a particular autonomous system for the next 10–15 years, with an up-gradation
    option to cater to futuristic changes. Similarly, HEIs can help create data sets
    that would be required for various intelligent systems for training purposes.
    Moreover, keeping in view the research potential and availability of specialized
    equipment, HEIs can even develop numerous systems as part of the ASaaS business
    model. E.g., a university equipped with cutting-edge robotics technologies may
    develop prototypes of some personal, service, and social robots. These prototypes
    can be employed in universities’ campuses for further testing and optimization.
    Similarly, universities can design and develop prototypes of iLighting systems
    and use them in local council areas to gather environmental data and provide various
    services to the users. Subsequently, universities can collaborate with manufacturers/vendors
    for the ToT and commercial level development of new technologies/products. FIGURE
    16. Role of universities. Show All Another critical aspect that seeks the attention
    of HEIs is the evaluation of safety aspects related to autonomous systems. Here,
    the point of concern is uncontrolled or biased actions [203] by autonomous systems
    due to hardware or software bug threatening human lives. Similarly, research scientists
    from HEIs or specialized research centers can play their part in the research
    and development of security solutions against cyber threats at all stages of STPs’
    development, i.e., planning, design, development, and operation. Universities
    are also expected to build up a research collaboration with industry to stimulate
    patenting, licensing, and development of new technologies and products. Correspondingly,
    universities are increasingly emphasizing the creation of new startups/companies
    as a mechanism for commercialization [10] of newly developed technologies and
    products. E.g., University of Technology Sydney (UTS’s) “Startups” [213] and “Techcelerator”
    [214] programs aim at helping young entrepreneurs to promote their ideas, develop
    prototypes, and survive successfully through their infancy stages. These programs
    provide all necessary support to the students in terms of collaboration spaces,
    mentorship, profile-building, community-building, and enhancing prototyping and
    market-testing skills. Therefore, it is certain that if facilities like UTS’s
    Startups, and Techcelerator are available in STPs, many young firms can benefit
    from them. Moreover, universities are the best platform to communicate technological
    advancements identified through R&D to the business community and industry partners.
    This will also help in better understanding and propagation of innovative ideas.
    Thus increasing the chances of getting R&D grants. It is also foreseen that HEIs
    can facilitate technology diffusion by providing technical consultancy and establishing
    technology transfer centers through the licensing of university-based technologies
    to existing firms or new ventures [11]. Similarly, academic and specialized research
    centers can promote the development of new technologies by providing specialized
    equipment and labs for testing and evaluation. In the same way, HEIs should continuously
    carry out an appraisal of technologies employed in STPs to identify vulnerabilities
    and suggest improvements. SECTION VI. Components of a STP Based on our discussion
    on STP’s objectives in Section II-A and ASaaS in Section III, it is envisaged
    that components shown in Table.2 should form part of a STP to support attainment
    of most of its goals/objectives. As discussed in Section V universities and other
    HEIs are essential for the success of STPs. They are the source of knowledge spillover
    and also facilitate R&D collaboration with the industry. Moreover, HEIs can also
    support new startups and young entrepreneurs in the early stages of their establishment.
    Similarly, private-sector or even government-sponsored R&D centers located inside
    STPs can collaborate with HEIs and industries to solve future problems. In addition
    to R&D cooperation, technical consultancy services to tech-based startups in any
    form, i.e., technical advice or skilled resource, are necessary for new prototypes
    or product development. Correspondingly, new startups, entrepreneurs, and tech-based
    firms are some of the cardinal components of a STP that boost technological advancements.
    Likewise, representatives from industries such as manufacturing, agriculture,
    robotics, and construction should also be located in the park to coordinate and
    drive industry-focused research. TABLE 2 Components of a Science and Technology
    Park Another critical element is the provision of business support by STP management
    to the tenants. This support can be in the form of consultation related to marketing,
    finance, IP, copyrights, and government regulations. Furthermore, public and private
    VC organizations and seed capital providers with a presence in STP may provide
    financial support to the firms/startups. Subsequently, government agents from
    various regulatory bodies, e.g., finance, law, customs, cybersecurity, ICT, research
    and innovation, and IP, should be there in the STP to ensure compliance with government
    policies/regulations. Similarly, the presence of a suitably composed onsite park
    management is vital to govern and resolve all the issues related to maintenance,
    tenant registration and accommodation, event management, dispute resolution, supply
    chain management, disaster management, and security of park infrastructure. Other
    than park management, ICT service providers are also one of the core elements
    of a STP. ICT service providers must be involved in all the planning and development
    stages so that ICT services are available to the park developers, management,
    and tenants from the initial phases of their settlement in the park. Subsequently,
    after the start of ICT operations in the STP, a Security Operations Center (SOCS)
    is a crucial entity. SOC is a centralized function within the STP that employs
    people, processes, and technology to continuously monitor and improve security
    posture. Its primary objective is to prevent, detect, analyze, and respond to
    cybersecurity incidents [215]. On the other hand, to ensure road safety and regulate
    the MaaS system, Roads and Transport Services’ (RTS) availability in the park
    is of fundamental importance. Moreover, the adverse effects of global warming
    in the form of floods, storms, bush fires, and cyclones are on the rise than ever
    before. Hence, in coordination with respective government agencies, the STP management
    should prepare a comprehensive Disaster Recovery and Management (DRM) plan. And
    equip STP with the necessary equipment and allied resources. Similarly, to provide
    a high standard of living to the tenants, park management must arrange essential
    commodities such as grocery stores, restaurants, motels, parks, sports centers,
    gyms, hospitals, cinemas, professional gaming zones, etc. Likewise, to facilitate
    knowledge sharing and networking/collaboration between onsite firms/companies/HEIs,
    there should be libraries, auditoriums, and community centers at the STP. Park
    management may coordinate and arrange different social events, academic conferences,
    workshops, or seminars to build networking and collaboration opportunities between
    various stakeholders. In the same way, keeping in view the scope of R&D, the park
    management, in coordination with HEIs, and industry partners, should ensure the
    availability of necessary equipment, spares, and tools to meet demands in the
    minimum possible time. Also, to further enhance the STP’s livability, cutting-edge
    smart homes/units at economical rates should be provided to the park tenants.
    Correspondingly, to make STP a rare attraction for all the stakeholders with an
    innovative look, different autonomous systems should be employed to provide value-added
    services to the tenants. SECTION VII. Future Challenges Though we believe that
    ASaaS business model for STPs has more merits than the demerits. However, there
    are some significant challenges concerning autonomous systems that must be given
    due consideration during the design and development stages and while integrating
    different systems. It is a daunting task to ensure open-sourcing of autonomous
    systems and their compliance with international standards once a myriad of technologies
    and systems operate in a STP. Moreover, it is also an open challenge to control
    fully autonomous systems’ biasedness or malicious action if they are compromised
    or malfunction. Similarly, it is currently difficult to assess the transparency
    of fully autonomous systems. Furthermore, it is also challenging to draw a balance
    between transparency and privacy in autonomous systems. Correspondingly, the governments
    should update their data security and privacy regulations by including some clauses
    on autonomous systems’ unbiased decision making and transparency. Concerning the
    ASaaS user interface, we envision that the autonomous systems should intuitively
    interact with the users, which can be achieved using NLP supporting multiple languages,
    including French, English, Chinese, Hindi, Urdu, etc.). The users must find the
    interface familiar and straightforward where they can interact using voice and
    text commands. It is also essential that the user interface for each user should
    support customized settings as per the services subscribed by the respective user.
    Similarly, the STP tenants and other users should have a simple way, e.g., a slider
    to control the priority of their jobs for each service. The cost and the estimated
    time for the desired service can then be calculated and displayed in real-time
    on the user interface. If we look at system-specific merits and challenges, firstly,
    the autonomous waste management system requires considerable research for accurate
    identification and classification of objects. So that fast decaying items should
    be collected and disposed off immediately. The DaaS’s on-demand nature allows
    shipments to be sent as soon as they are ready rather than waiting for the following
    day’s shipping run. Thus DaaS supports the rapid fulfillment of time-critical
    deliveries. Moreover, data gathered both actively and passively can enhance the
    DaaS delivery system’s capability to track shipments accurately. However, inclement
    weather can affect the drones’ operation. Therefore, graded priority on jobs can
    help the system make intelligent decisions about responding to such events. Correspondingly,
    ground-based autonomous vehicles can be a suitable alternative to drones in inclement
    weather. Besides, the autonomous cars carrying more sensors are also suited to
    continuous mapping functions to update the real-time 3D map of STP. We also believe
    that a subscription to the DaaS health emergency service will save loved ones’
    lives. Concerning the STP Data Arena, a considerable effort is required to develop
    a privacy-preserving data analytics framework that must protect users against
    data privacy and security threats. Likewise, if we look at aFaaS, it has a lot
    of potentials. However, in addition to establishing model autonomous Agri farms
    in STPs, farmers worldwide need to be educated on Agri technologies’ use-cases
    and benefits. Hence, there is a need to address farmers’ concerns/misconceptions
    over safety, security, and loss of jobs due to autonomous robots. Another critical
    issue for autonomous systems is the availability of suitable datasets. Correspondingly,
    The datasets for cyber security are equally important in intrusion detection.
    Actually, most and recent intrusion detection systems are tested with KDD 1999,
    NSL-KDD, CICIDS2017, and Bot-IoT [178]. However, these datasets are not designed
    for IoT-based Agri tech scenarios. Hence, there is a requirement of developing
    new datasets for IoT-based agriculture environment to build network security and
    other service models. For blockchain supported IoT-based Agri tech solutions,
    the critical area to explore is validation of IoT devices’ integrity. This is
    also termed as an “Oracle Problem” for blockchain applications, where ensuring
    integrity of data input to the blockchain is an open challenge. Similarly, security
    of blockchain applications and smart contracts require considerable efforts in
    addition to conventional security measures. SECTION VIII. Conclusion STPs are
    considered to be the epitome of innovation and growth of a technology-based economy.
    However, for a STP to be successful, it should have the means to attract technology-based
    companies, related businesses, and industries. Therefore, to impart a futuristic
    look to STPs, we introduced the concept of autonomous systems as a service. We
    believe that the autonomous systems-based business model will increase the liveability
    in the STPs and provide a playground for the testing and evaluation of new technologies
    in a controlled environment. On the contrary, entrepreneurs and tech-based firms
    cannot reasonably evaluate new products and technologies without impacting the
    general population’s safety and privacy. However, autonomous Agri technologies
    need to be more robust and intelligent to operate effectively in a world of ever-increasing
    natural calamities, like bush fires, flash floods, storms, and earthquakes. We
    also anticipate reducing the operational costs and increase the serviceability
    of the autonomous systems. It can be achieved by ensuring that the autonomous
    systems must perform self-diagnostics to monitor the health of their equipment,
    devices/components, and schedule replacements and maintenance accordingly. This
    study also appraised threats to data security and privacy in autonomous systems
    and proposed requisite security measures. Subsequently, we observe that ensuring
    the security of multidimensional data acquisition, storage, and processing systems
    against perilous cyber threats is an appalling task that requires careful planning,
    risk assessment, and a defense-in-depth approach. This research also specified
    many components that may contribute to attaining the overall objectives of a STP.
    Finally, numerous challenges concerning autonomous systems were emphasized to
    facilitate practical implementation of the proposed ASaaS business model in near
    future. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics More Like This The

  description: Water is the most important role in day-to-day life. Water shortage
    is becoming a reality as water use and pollution continue to grow concern round
    the universe while s o m e reckless individuals waste water on a regular basis
    by overusing it, a large population remains without access to clean drinking water.
    This problem is caused by the irregular distribution of water. To deal with this,
    we need a solution that gives data about water flow rate as well as water use
    of an industrial area or home to the government to enable proper water distribution.
    This paper aims to build a Smart Water Metering System (SWMS) for real-time water
    monitoring. The relatively recent Smart Water Metering (SWM) Technology offers
    high resolution and frequent watering consumption data which may be wont to improve
    water protection and management by providing suggestions to customers. Water is
    one among the vital resources for the existence of human life then the Smart water
    management system features a key role in smart city. Through using moderate Internet
    of thing equipment including mobile applications, a smart metering solution suggested
    varies with standard production techniques. This device requires all Meter Readers
    to use standard devices as single local suppliers to do smart meter and upgrade
    the database of the network. An online tracking system is to provide these data
    on web dB in real-time. The routing protocol increases the reliability of water
    supply and lowers the use of electricity, potential failures and, as a result,
    loss of water supplies, and the alternative methods needed for smart water metering
    have been reviewed. And a design for a Smart water meter is proposed and an implementation
    detail of Smart water metering system is discussed.

    Split-Screen PDF Share Tools Water is the most important role in day-to-day life.
    Water shortage is becoming a reality as water use and pollution continue to grow
    concern round the universe while s o m e reckless individuals waste water on a
    regular basis by overusing it, a large population remains without access to clean
    drinking water. This problem is caused by the irregular distribution of water.
    To deal with this, we need a solution that gives data about water flow rate as
    well as water use of an industrial area or home to the government to enable proper
    water distribution. This paper aims to build a Smart Water Metering System (SWMS)
    for real-time water monitoring. The relatively recent Smart Water Metering (SWM)
    Technology offers high resolution and frequent watering consumption data which
    may be wont to improve water protection and management by providing suggestions
    to customers. Water is one among the vital resources for the existence of human
    life then the Smart water management system features a key role in smart city.
    Through using moderate Internet of thing equipment including mobile applications,
    a smart metering solution suggested varies with standard production techniques.
    This device requires all Meter Readers to use standard devices as single local
    suppliers to do smart meter and upgrade the database of the network. An online
    tracking system is to provide these data on web dB in real-time. The routing protocol
    increases the reliability of water supply and lowers the use of electricity, potential
    failures and, as a result, loss of water supplies, and the alternative methods
    needed for smart water metering have been reviewed. And a design for a Smart water
    meter is proposed and an implementation detail of Smart water metering system
    is discussed. Topics Mass measurement, Hydrology, Internet of things, Tracking

  description: 'Like natural ecosystems, the cyber ecosystem comprises a variety of
    diverse participants - private firms, non-profits, governments, individuals, processes,
    and cyber devices (computers, software, and communications technologies) - that
    interact for multiple purposes. Today in cyberspace, intelligent adversaries exploit
    vulnerabilities and create incidents that propagate at machine speeds to steal
    identities, resources, and advantage. The rising volume and virulence of these
    attacks have the potential to degrade our economic capacity and threaten basic
    services that underpin our modern way of life. This discussion paper explores
    the idea of a healthy, resilient - and fundamentally more secure - cyber ecosystem
    of the future, in which cyber participants, including cyber devices, are able
    to work together in near-real time to anticipate and prevent cyber attacks, limit
    the spread of attacks across participating devices, minimize the consequences
    of attacks, and recover to a trusted state. In this future cyber ecosystem, security
    capabilities are built into cyber devices in a way that allows preventive and
    defensive courses of action to be coordinated within and among communities of
    devices. Power is distributed among participants, and near-real time coordination
    is enabled by combining the innate and interoperable capabilities of individual
    devices with trusted information exchanges and shared, configurable policies.
    To illuminate such a cyber ecosystem in action, one might look at today''s practice
    known as “continuous monitoring,” in which system managers use a variety of software
    products to automatically detect and report known security vulnerabilities in
    network nodes. In some cases, system managers further configure their systems
    to automatically remediate detected security deficiencies. To offer an analogy,
    continuous monitoring is to a healthy cyber ecosystem as smoke detectors and sprinkler
    systems are to a “smart” building. At the other end of sophistication in the orderly
    management of a complex system, we draw inspiration from the human body''s immune
    system. To paint a picture that mirrors the body''s ability to defend itself is
    complex. It might include layered defenses and countermeasures that work in tandem;
    specialized roles; powerful methods for rapidly identifying attackers; surge capabilities;
    and the ability to learn and rapidly adapt. A companion analogy may be made to
    the public health system and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
    Here, cyber equivalent functions might include threat and incident watch, data
    dissemination, threat analysis, intervention recommendations, and coordination
    of preventive actions. Automation is one of three interdependent building blocks
    of a healthy cyber ecosystem, along with interoperability and authentication.
    Automation can increase speed of action, optimize decision making, and ease adoption
    of new security solutions. A healthy cyber ecosystem might employ an automation
    strategy of fixed, local defenses supported by mobile and global defenses at multiple
    levels. Such a strategy could enable the cyber ecosystem to sustain itself and
    supported missions while fighting through attacks. Further, it could enable the
    ecosystem to continuously strengthen itself against the cyber equivalent of autoimmune
    disorders. Interoperability can broaden and strengthen collaboration, create new
    intelligence, hasten and spread learning, and improve situational awareness. This
    paper posits three types of interoperability - semantic (i.e., shared lexicon
    based on common understanding), technical, and policy - as fundamental to integrating
    disparate cyber participants into a comprehensive cyber defense system. It examines
    how the cybersecurity community has achieved some early successes by explicitly
    separating the management of security information from the management of security
    functions in an approach called security content automation. Such successes include:
    developing naming conventions and shared lists and catalogs of the fundamental
    elements that we identify here as the ecosystem; creating and using machine readable
    languages and formats for expressing security policies or encoding security transactions;
    and developing and using knowledge repositories for best practices, benchmarks,
    profiles, standards, templates, checklists, tools, guidelines, rules and principles,
    among others. The paper also looks at some challenges associated with expanding
    this approach to ensure a widely distributed, automated, collective defense. Authentication
    can improve trust in ways that enhance privacy and decision making. It is integral
    to many capabilities beyond cyber defense, and the paper looks to the emerging
    National Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyberspace (NSTIC), detailed below,
    to build a shared foundation. The paper calls for identification and authentication
    technologies that deliver across five operational objectives: security, affordability,
    ease of use and administration, scalability, and interoperability. Additionally,
    the paper calls for consumer guides that rate technologies across all five objectives
    and assist system developers and owners in making phased improvements and selections.
    For automated cyber defense, it calls for strong standards-based device authentication,
    including for software, handheld devices, and small, often wireless, devices composing
    massively scalable grids. The paper also draws on current research on network-enabled
    enterprises that is recasting traditional notions of command and control in the
    direction of focus and convergence. Focus provides the context and defines the
    purposes of an endeavor, but is agnostic regarding who might be in charge or particular
    lines of authority. Convergence refers to the goal-seeking process that guides
    actions and effects, but recognizes that control works in an unconventional manner
    in highly distributed systems. The paper presents a five-level maturity model
    for ecosystem focus and convergence that is associated with increasing agility
    and provides an approach for defining how to achieve and employ these various
    levels. Ecosystem maturity is further explored through a discussion of healthy
    attributes-eight for the ecosystem and eighteen for participants and exchanges.
    The paper concludes with a brief discussion of incentives and recommendations
    for the way ahead. It posits that the slow adoption of available best practices
    and technologies in the face of increasing cyber attacks indicates an imbalance
    of incentives and proposes that better and more widely disseminated aggregated
    and anonymized information about the frequency and actual harm of cyber attacks
    is needed. Despite the many open questions remaining, the field is ripe for planning
    and action.'

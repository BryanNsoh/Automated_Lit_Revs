  data_sources: 'The primary data sources used in the study were:


    * Crop response data (seed cotton yield, evapotranspiration, crop water productivity,
    and irrigation water use efficiency)

    * Irrigation scheduling data (cumulative irrigation, irrigation level)'
  explanation: The overall purpose of this study was to investigate the feasibility
    of using an Irrigation Scheduling Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (ISSCADA)
    system to manage deﬁcit irrigation of cotton in a semi-arid region. Irrigation
    scheduling was compared to that of a manual method, the latter irrigating based
    on weekly neutron probe (NP) readings. The feasibility was determined by comparing
    the ISSCADA method to the manual method on metrics of seed cotton yield, evapotranspiration,
    crop water productivity, and irrigation water use efficiency.
  extract_1: In this study, automated deﬁcit irrigation scheduling strategies for
    cotton within a semi-arid region were investigated. During the growing seasons
    of 2021 and 2022, deﬁcit irrigation was managed using the ISSCADA system and a
    manual method. These methods were compared with fully irrigated treatment plots.
    The ISSCADA system operated on two different irrigation scheduling methods, the
    plant feedback and the hybrid. Both methods were compared to the manual irrigation
    scheduling method in which irrigation was applied to replenish crop water use
    according to NP measurements on a weekly basis.
  extract_2: In 2021, seed cotton yields in all treatments were less than the yields
    from 2022. However, in 2021, mean cumulative irrigations for the ISSCADA-plant
    feedback and the ISSCADA-hybrid treatments at the I75, I50 and I25 levels were
    significantly lower compared with the manual data-logging method. In this same
    year, mean ETc values for the M25 and H25 treatments were signiﬁcantly less than
    all irrigation scheduling methods at the I75 level.  In 2022, there were no differences
    in mean seed cotton yields among all treatments. However, mean cumulative irrigations
    for the ISSCADA-hybrid treatments were less than those for the manual and ISSCADA-plant
    feedback methods at the I50 level.

  key_findings: 'The key findings of the study were as follows:


    1. In both years of the study, deﬁcit irrigation at the I75 level by the manual
    (M) and by both ISSCADA irrigation scheduling methods (the plant feedback and
    hybrid) maintained seed cotton yields that were similar compared with that of
    the fully irrigated treatment plots, while achieving signiﬁcant water savings.

    2. Results at each deﬁcit irrigation level for this study demonstrated that the
    ISSCADA irrigation methods performed in a manner similar to the manual irrigation
    scheduling method.

    3. The ISSCADA-plant feedback method alone could be used to manage deﬁcit irrigation
    scheduling at mild, moderate, and extreme deﬁcit irrigation levels for cotton
    production in a semi-arid environment.'
  limitations: The study was conducted at a single site in a semi-arid region, so
    the results may not be generalizable to other regions with different climates
    or soil conditions. The study was also conducted for only two years, so the results
    may not be representative of long-term performance of the ISSCADA system. Lastly,
    the study did not investigate the economic feasibility of using the ISSCADA system.
  main_objective: Investigate the feasibility of using an Irrigation Scheduling Supervisory
    Control and Data Acquisition (ISSCADA) system to manage deﬁcit irrigation of cotton
    in a semi-arid region.
  relevance_evaluation: The evaluation of how an automated ISSCADA system compares
    to a manual method of irrigation scheduling is relevant to the point being made
    in the review, which is to assess the current state, and future potential of,
    real-time, automated irrigation management systems. The study is also relevant
    because it was conducted in a semi-arid region, similar to those where the implementation
    of automated irrigation systems is most needed.

- explanation: 'The study uses a mathematical model to investigate the economic impacts
    of deploying automated precision irrigation systems that use IoT and machine learning
    technologies, with the ultimate goal to reduce groundwater depletion in the Mississippi
    Delta region. The authors use the model to compare the cost-effectiveness and
    return per acre-foot of two different remote monitoring methods: soil moisture
    sensors and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The evaluation takes into account
    how crop patterns and irrigation usage change over time as the aquifer is depleted
    and groundwater availability decreases. The authors find that both remote monitoring
    methods can lead to substantial improvements in irrigation efficiency and groundwater
    conservation, but the choice of which method is more cost-effective depends on
    a number of factors, including the costs of the sensors and UAVs, the irrigation
    efficiency improvements that can be achieved, and the scale of the farming operation.


    The authors'' analysis suggests that soil moisture sensors have a slight edge
    over UAVs in terms of cost-effectiveness and net returns per acre-foot of aquifer
    retention, but that the lower cost and improved efficiency of UAVs could make
    them a more attractive option in the future. The authors also find that the cost-effectiveness
    of both methods is improved when they are used in conjunction with on-farm reservoirs
    and tail-water recovery systems. The study also evaluates the effectiveness of
    different water conservation policies, such as cost-share programs for the remote
    monitoring technologies, caps on groundwater use, and fees on groundwater use.
    The authors find that the cost-share programs are more expensive than the other
    policies, but that they can be effective in encouraging adoption of the remote
    monitoring technologies. The authors conclude that remote monitoring and precision
    irrigation have the potential to significantly reduce groundwater depletion and
    improve the economic sustainability of agriculture in the Mississippi Delta region.'

    Abstract: Irrigated row-crop agriculture is contributing to declining groundwater
    in areas such

    as the Mississippi Delta region of eastern Arkansas. There is a need to move toward
    sustainable

    levels of groundwater withdrawal. Recent improvements in remote monitoring technologies
    such

    as wireless soil moisture sensors and unmanned aerial vehicles offer the potential
    for farmers to

    effectively practice site-speciﬁc variable-rate irrigation management for the
    purpose of applying

    water more efﬁciently, reducing pumping costs, and retaining groundwater. Soil
    moisture sensors

    and unmanned aerial vehicles are compared here in terms of their net returns per
    acre-foot and

    cost-effectiveness of aquifer retention. Soil moisture sensors ($9.09 per acre-foot)
    offer slightly

    more net returns to producers than unmanned aerial vehicles ($7.69 per acre-foot),
    though costs

    associated with unmanned aerial vehicles continue to drop as more manufacturers
    enter the market

    and regulations become clear.'

  explanation: The study compared the performance of two scientific decision support
    systems for managing irrigation of maize and soybeans. The ISSCADA plant feedback
    method prescribed the least irrigation among the methods in most cases. The common
    practice method prescribed the largest seasonal irrigation depth among the methods
    for three crop-year cases. The maize yield in rainfed was found to be significantly
    lower than the irrigated levels in 2020 since 2020 was a dry year. No significant
    differences were observed in crop yield among the different irrigation methods
    for both years. The CWP among the different levels ranged between 2.72 and 3.15 kg 
    m−3 for 2020 maize, 1.03 and 1.13 kg  m−3 for 2020 soybean, 3.57 and 4.24 kg 
    m−3 for 2021 maize, and 1.19 and 1.48 kg  m−3 for 2021 soybean. Deficit level
    (50%) had the largest irrigation water productivity in all crop-year cases in
    this study.

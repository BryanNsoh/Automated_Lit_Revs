    rights and content Abstract Smart farming is a well-known and superior method
    of managing a farm, becoming more prevalent in today''s contemporary agricultural
    practices. Crops are monitored for their overall health and productivity using
    various information and agricultural technology. This involves monitoring the
    state of the field crops and looking at various other indicators. The ultimate
    objective of smart farming is to decrease the amount of money spent on agricultural
    inputs while maintaining the same level of quality in the final result. The Internet
    of Things has enabled smart farming via different data collecting and storage
    methods. For example, intelligent sensor networks gather field data for optimum
    plant irrigation in contemporary irrigation systems. As the dependency of smart
    farming on the IoT environment increases, they become more vulnerable to cyber-attacks.
    The reason is that IoT networks include so many nodes with few resources available,

    farming 1. Introduction Over the past century, humanity''s population has grown
    exponentially. By 2100 [1], it is predicted to reach a maximum of 10.9 billion.
    In the last fifty years, technical advancements in genetic engineering have greatly
    contributed to an increase in the quality and quantity of the world''s food supplies.
    Plants and seeds improved through genetic engineering can help feed a growing
    population while using less water. The next technological advance in agriculture
    will be \"smart farming\", which will allow for the long-term sustainability of
    food production [2]. Smart farming is a mix of various emerging technologies like
    Blockchain, 5 G communications, artificial intelligence (AI), drones, the Internet
    of Things (IoT), edge/fog computing, cloud computing, software-defined networking
    (SDN), smart grids, etc. [3]. In the rest of the sections, smart farming, agriculture
    4, IoT enabled agriculture are used interchangeably. In smart farming, data must
    be shared between various smart devices, which is why intelligent agriculture
    devices use the wireless network to send information to the Edge/Fog node and
    sink node [3]. This wireless network can take many forms, including the mesh network
    (ZigBee based), the GSM network (4 G/5 G based), the star network (LoRa based),
    and the software-defined networking. Since many IoT devices are deployed in public
    air, the biggest obstacle to establishing smart farming is ensuring users'' security
    and privacy. Several privacy and security concerns are linked to each layer of
    the IoT architecture because smart devices rely mainly on wireless networks to
    communicate [4]. For instance, an adversary might launch a wide variety of cyberattacks,
    such as distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, to render a service inaccessible
    and then insert fake data, which has consequences for food security and the effectiveness
    of agri-food supply chain and agricultural output. Additionally, systems developed
    for the heating and ventilation of a vertical farm or a drone used for spraying
    crops might be compromised in a cyberattack that targets smart farming. Some recent
    high-profile cyberattacks include those on the water system in Florida [5], a
    beverage company in Australia called ion which deals in dairy and drinks, and
    the wool broker software that is considered the largest meatpacker in the world
    [6]. Protecting advanced IoT networks increasingly requires the use of intrusion
    detection systems. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are crucial for identifying
    malicious actions. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) are network security technology
    that monitors and analyze internal system events for signs of intrusion [7]. An
    intrusion detection system can recognize a network or operating system''s protocol
    failure. The IDS may be used in tandem with other security technologies, such
    as encryption methods, authentication, authorization, and Blockchain, to further
    protect smart farming systems against cyber-attacks [8,9]. While developing an
    IDS, many researchers turn to AI-based methods, including deep learning, hierarchical
    strategies, reinforcement learning, and voting-based extreme learning machines.
    Applying deep learning to the issue of network intrusion detection is a newer
    field of study. With the right data and training, deep learning can significantly
    improve large datasets'' representation extraction and result quality. And recently,
    deep learning has seen major advances thanks to the convolutional neural networks
    (CNNs) work. Agricultural IoT networks, like any other IoT network, have the same
    security and privacy concerns as any other IoT application. This paper presents
    a methodology to detect attacks on smart farming systems and agricultural IoT
    networks. The NSL KDD data set [10], developed to solve the problem of the KDD''99
    data set, which is mentioned in [11], is utilized as the input data set for this
    methodology. Data from NSL-KDD are pre-processed, all symbolic characteristics
    are converted to numerical ones, and all numerical ones are subsequently transformed
    into symbols. The principal component analysis is used to extract characteristics
    from a dataset. The pre-processed dataset is then fed to machine learning techniques,
    including linear regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest
    (RF), to establish its categorization. Measures of accuracy, Precision, and Recall
    are used to evaluate the efficacy of various machine learning (ML) algorithms.
    Not only are security and privacy crucial for IoT networks related to agriculture,
    but also for all different IoT applications. This paper proposes a system for
    identifying intrusions into agricultural-based Internet of Things networks that
    depends on CNN models in the detection task. A publicly available data set (NSL
    KDD) is utilized for evaluation purposes as input in the proposed approach. The
    data is first processed to obtain accurate results. Following this data-cleaning
    operation, the pre-processed dataset will be sent into the feature selection step.
    A recursive feature elimination (RFE) technique will cut down the total number
    of features and ensure that only discriminative features are passed on to the
    classification phase. At the next stage, the input data are converted from tabular
    format to images using a predetermined number of attributes. Then, image data
    were classified using several CNN models (VGG16, Xception, Inception), and we
    measured how well they performed using performance indicators such as accuracy,
    Precision, F1 Score, and Recall measurements. Finally, the best-performing CNN
    model is chosen for hyperparameters optimization to achieve an optimal fit between
    the dataset and this model. This paper has the following contributions: • Constructed
    an efficient IDS that applies a deep learning approach to provide accurate intrusion
    detection with a reduced feature set. • Propose a hyperparameter tuning for deep
    learning pre-trained models using a PSO optimizer that allows the proposed model
    to improve the evaluation metrics compared with the model without hyperparameter
    tuning. • Evaluated the proposed method using the NSL-KDD dataset and used multiple
    performance indicators, which show that the results of our method outperform existing
    approaches. • Critically evaluate the existing literature on cyber threats on
    the NSL KDD dataset. • Presented details of threats to smart farming and their
    implications. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 defines
    details of possible attacks on smart farming systems. Section 3 presents existing
    intrusion detection systems applied to the NSL KDD dataset. Section 4 explains
    the proposed methodology to detect intrusions in a smart farming environment.
    Section 5 shows and discusses our approach''s experimental results and compares
    them with state of the art. Section 6 presents the conclusions and future steps
    of our work. 2. Cyber attacks in smart farming systems An agricultural product
    requires a combination of various technologies to execute certain activities.
    For example, an irrigation system contains smart sensors, different actuators,
    several software modules, communication protocols, and human involvement. These
    complicated systems are generally outsourced from multiple suppliers, which increases
    the attack surface. Cybercriminals can exploit weaknesses to hack agricultural
    applications. Some attacks are comparable to those that target IoT networks, while
    others are unique to smart farming. There are different forms of threats in a
    smart farming environment. One form occurs because the Investment in a smart farming
    system is often substantial, and the systems may remain in use for years. Technicians,
    farmers, merchants, service providers, and others utilize them often during their
    careers. Users'' private information may be at risk if they access the system,
    opening the door to identity theft. Commercially sensitive information is another
    risk. Theft of data results in the disclosure of private business information,
    which may compromise both local and international business dealings (farmer to
    a service provider or international trade). There are many ways to categorize
    commercially sensitive data. Production efficiency data are used by competitors
    in trade choices, giving them an edge over primary producers. Furthermore, growth
    data might lead to focused study and IP theft attempts. Competitors may get an
    advantage in negotiations by acquiring access to sensitive information such as
    a farm''s land value, price information, trade volume, selling patterns, and growth
    statistics. These firms become weak links in a network that hackers may exploit.
    Another attack form to smart farming systems is compromising sensors, actuators,
    or robots, which causes their malfunction. Fields may be destroyed, unauthorised
    products transported, crimes committed, or physical assaults made by smashing
    heavy tractors or drones into the target. Hazardous attacks may be launched using
    GPS spoofing, side-channel attacks, and wireless communication flaws. There are
    also risks associated with the data while they are transmitted, which involve
    the devices and protocols used by networks. It is possible to exploit vulnerabilities
    to sniff out and access data, which can lead to various attacks. These attacks
    include denial of service attacks, man-in-the-middle attacks, and routing attacks.
    On the other hand, there are risks associated with data not actively being used,
    regardless of whether it is stored on the cloud or locally. The theft of IP might
    result from the breach of data. Examples of these breaches include SQL injection
    and flooding attacks [12]. The proliferation of cyberattacks on the components
    of smart farming systems has led to the necessity of developing effective and
    efficient IDSs to face the catastrophic effects of cybercrimes. The procurement
    of software, hardware, and other services from a variety of suppliers introduces
    security concerns, which have to be taken into consideration during the design
    of smart agricultural systems. There is also the possibility of a disruption in
    the supply chain, resulting in malfunctions in product design, engineering, manufacture,
    and distribution of products and services from suppliers to consumers [13]. Table
    1 summarizes different categories for cyber attacks in smart Farming systems and
    the affected security aspect of each category, supported by their related work.

    be implemented using classical machine learning, deep learning, and hybrid Machine
    Learning. This paper tested the proposed method on one of the most cited and popular
    IDS datasets and NSL-KDD. Various classical machine learning algorithms were explored
    and evaluated for anomaly-based IDS on the NSL-KDD dataset, such as Logistic regressions
    (LR), Artificial Neural networks (ANN), Naïve Bayes (NB), decision trees (DT),
    support vector machines (SVM), and random forest (RF). On the other hand, many
    works applied deep learning algorithms such as Convolution neural networks (CNN),
    deep belief networks (DBN), recurrent neural networks (RNN), and autoencoders
    (AE) for IDSs in IoT networks. In this section, recent related IDSs that used
    classical machine learning algorithms and deep learning-based approaches have
    been explored and conducted on the NSL-KDD dataset. Wang et al. [25] proposed
    an intrusion detection system that leverages both supervised and unsupervised
    learning capabilities to increase the detection process''s performance. The k-Means
    algorithm is used to enhance the classification ability of the KNN classifier
    by changing the way the nearest neighbors are selected. The developed model achieved
    comparable results in classifying the four attacks in the NSL KDD dataset. Using
    DNN for IDSs in SDNs, Rawat et al. [26] found the best hyperparameters and network
    configurations in the DNN, resulting in an accuracy of 75.9%. A Localized Evolving
    Based Anomaly Detection Scheme that belongs to Semi-Supervised Learning was introduced
    by Wang et al. [27]. Self-evolution was enabled during anomaly detection by combining
    offline and online learning with a semi-supervised training approach in contrasting
    pessimistic likelihood estimation (CPLE). As a result, the unlabeled data is given
    a strict label during self-training, which makes the model less accurate and leads
    to more misclassification. In CPLE-based models, unlabeled data is soft-labeled.
    Semi-supervised training with 500 labeled and 120,000 unlabeled data points was
    used to create the model. When all features in the dataset are utilized, the recommended
    method achieves an accuracy of 80.93% using NSL-KDD, whereas when just six features
    are used, it achieves an accuracy of 77.26%. Applying ML methods to SDN architecture,
    Dey et al. [28] proposed an OpenFlow controller-based flow-based anomaly detection
    solution. The foundation of their study is the NSL-KDD, which consists of 41 individual
    traits. The dataset was pre-processed using various feature selection strategies,
    such as the Chi-square test, Gain Ratio, Correlation-based Feature Selection (CFS)
    attribute subset evaluator, Info Gain, and Symmetric Uncertainty to improve classifier
    output. All feature selection methods retrieved 15 features, except for the CFS
    Subset Evaluator, which only extracted 9. We next apply several classifiers on
    the smaller dataset (10-fold cross-validation is used to aggregate findings from
    J48, Bayes Net, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and Random Forest). This study obtained
    an accuracy of 82% when Gain was utilized as a Ratio feature selector, and Random
    Forest was utilized as a classifier. Latah and Toker [29] examined a variety of
    anomaly-based intrusion detection algorithms and rated their performance using
    a variety of metrics. They focused on developing supervised machine learning algorithms
    that use the following classifiers: Naïve Bayes, Decision trees, Random Forest,
    Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest-Neighbor, Neural networks, Bagging Trees, different
    boosting algorithms, and Linear Discriminant Analysis. Principal Component Analysis
    was used to de-dimensionalize the data, and the researchers did this by concentrating
    on only six SDN characteristics. The Decision Tree, which has a rate of accuracy
    of 83.24 percent and an f-score of 89.38 percent, produced the most significant
    results. Tang et al. [30] trained a DNN for flow-based anomaly detection in a
    software-defined network (SDN) model for IDSs. They built a DNN with one input
    layer, three hidden layers, and an output layer. They used six features that fed
    to input neurons. These SDN features include basic and traffic-based features.
    Model output is a binary classifier. They employed 12–6-3 hidden layers of neurons.
    The model start settings are ten batches and 100 epochs. The experiments were
    75.7% accurate. Latah and Toker [31] developed a classification approach consisting
    of five-layer that employs KNN, Extreme Learning Machines (ELM), and a hierarchical
    model of ELM (H-ELM) for the first, second, and subsequent layers of the classification.
    The technique takes as input a total of six flow attributes. They used the controller''s
    top-level six flow parameters. Using the NSL-KDD dataset, they discovered that
    their multilayer approach improved system accuracy by 84.29%. A major adaptive
    component, or A-PCA, was introduced by Gao et al. [32] for an IDS that is an improved
    version of ELM, which is the Incremental Extreme Learning Machine (I-ELM). The
    critical parts of network traffic are selectively chosen using an adaptive process.
    As a result, the I-ELM achieves the best detection accuracy possible. The A-PCA
    is responsible for automatically extracting features based on the restrictions
    of the parameters, while the I-ELM is in charge of determining whether or not
    an attack was malicious. The NSL-KDD dataset was used to analyze how well this
    approach performed. A detection rate of 96.1% was achieved during this experiment,
    and they had an accuracy of 81.22%. Zheng et al. [33] suggested an enhanced Extreme
    Learning Machine Classification based on Linear Discriminant analysis as an intrusion
    detection system. By adding a function that measures spatial similarity as a weight
    to LDA, they were able to enhance the between-class scatter matrix, obtain the
    optimal transformation matrix for spatially separating high-dimensional data,
    and use it to shorten the feature set used in the classification phase. They used
    ELM with the single hidden layer NN approach to recognize the data after its dimensions
    were reduced. Evaluation results showed that the proposed ILECA improved generalization
    features and achieved a 92.35% accuracy rate. Rani [34] built an intrusion detection
    system using DNN and a technique based on classifier-level class imbalance. After
    the network data have been pre-processed via data conversion, the data are normalized
    using the min-max approach. After the information has been normalized, it is input
    into an artificial neural network, which subsequently alters the cross-entropy
    function to deal with the imbalanced dataset. The class labels are given weights
    during the training process. The accuracy of the system was measured at 85.56%.
    By combining a long-term memory with a short-term memory in a bidirectional LSM,
    Imrana et al. [35] created an IDS (BiDLSTM). On the NSL-KDD dataset, the BiDLSTM
    method was shown to be more effective than the regular LSTM. Compared to baseline
    LSTM''s 87.26% accuracy, it performed at 91.93%. Table 2 reviews the latest research
    works pertinent to the network traffic categorization test on the NSL-KDD dataset.

    of prior research demonstrates that thanks to deep learning developments, CNN-based
    techniques are gaining popularity. Most studies present a collection of pre-processed
    data to the applicable classifiers, and most research has focused on developing
    end-to-end models using deep neural networks (DNN) architectures such as Convolution
    neural network (CNN). Using these models can lead to useful outcomes, such as
    reduced complexity in the data and enhanced ability to classify it. However, there
    are two major flaws in the majority of the works that have been reviewed: The
    first is that the class-imbalance problem isn''t being addressed by most recent
    efforts, which instead focus on various deep learning methodologies to address
    performance constraints in this domain. Second, the models that do not apply feature
    selection procedures employ features not discriminated against for final decision-making.
    As a result, only a select few papers have addressed these two pressing issues.
    Additionally, most of the analyzed work use features in numerical format, which
    is not the best format for using CNN models that work perfectly with image data.
    The proposed method''s first feature is pre-processing, followed by data balancing.
    After that, numerical features are transformed into images for the best use of
    CNN model capabilities. 4. Methodology of intrusion detection in the smart farm
    environment In this section, we introduce our methodology, which aims to enhance
    the performance of systems that detect intrusions in smart farming environments.
    The proposed wireless network IDS can be applied in a smart farm, as shown in
    Fig. 1, where sensors on Framing and watering components collect Wi-Fi frames
    and send them to the proposed IDS for attack detection. The proposed algorithm
    includes seven stages, as shown in Fig. 2. Firstly, data is collected for experimental
    purposes. In this work, we used the NSL-KDD dataset [10]. Secondly, the data is
    pre-processed to achieve a high-performance model. The number of features produced
    after the data cleaning process is 11 features. Thirdly, the pre-processed dataset
    will be the input to the feature selection stage, which includes applying a recursive
    feature elimination algorithm to reduce the number of features and guarantee that
    only discriminative features will be used in the classification stage—applying
    recursive feature elimination algorithm help to cut the feature set to 9 features.
    In the fourth step, tabular data is transformed into images based on the number
    of selected features so that input images can fit the CNN models. In the sixth
    step, the classification process is implemented using different CNN models (VGG16,
    Xception, Inception), and the model was assessed using different performance indicators.
    Finally, the CNN model with the best performance (VGG16) is selected for the hyperparameters
    optimization stage to fit the dataset with this model for superior results. Download

    The proposed methodology for intrusion detection systems in smart farms. 4.1.
    Pre-processing phase For our study, we are only interested in detecting the intrusion.
    That is, the proposed approach aims to determine whether any intrusion has occurred
    in the network system. So this problem is considered as a binary classification
    problem. The first step in the proposed methodology is data pre-processing which
    consider a crucial stage in most machine learning pipelines. In this step, several
    operations are performed on raw data, such as dealing with missing values and
    dimension reduction for faster processing and better performance. Algorithm 1
    shows the performed pre-processing steps. Algorithm 1. Pre-processing stage. 1.Check
    NULL values present in Train set and Test set 2.Convert categorical features to
    numerical using One-Hot encoding technique 3.Check number of 0 s in the Target
    Column in Train set and Test set 4.Target Encoding normal to 0, all attacks to
    1 in new column \"is_intrusion\" 5.Drop the redundant label columns [''attack'',
    ''intrusion'', ''level''] and use only [''is_intrusion''] 6.Removing features
    where variation is 0 7.Drop redundant and meaningless input features 8.Compute
    the standard correlation between attributes and Target column 9.Select a set of
    features that are highly correlated with the Target column 10.Remove high correlated
    feature by checking collinearity The pre-processing algorithm starts by checking
    the data for null values and then removing the data row containing any missing
    value due to the abundance of data. Since the feature set contains both Numeric
    and Categorical fields. The second step is to convert categorical data into numbers
    using one-hot encoding to be ready for further processing by the machine learning
    algorithms. Thirdly, the label column is encoded into two values: 0 denotes no
    intrusion, and all other attack values as 1, which denotes that there has been
    an intrusion. A new column named “is intrusion” is added, containing the flags
    above for each record. The column intrusion is now set as our target column. In
    the fourth step, the columns with zero variations are removed since they won''t
    contribute to the classification process as they lack meaningfulness and discrimination
    abilities. In the fifth step, a statistical approach is used to study the input
    features'' relationship with the target column. The correlations of the input
    features with the target column are calculated. Columns that have a very high
    (> 0.9) or a very low (near 0) correlation with the target column are removed
    from the feature set such as [ (num_outbound_cmds), (srv_count), (dst_bytes),
    (src_bytes), (land), (is_host_login), (urgent), (num_failed_logins), (num_shells)].
    Then, the top 20 features that are most correlated with the target column ordered
    by their absolute value are selected, as shown in Table 3. The sixth step is to
    check for collinearity between input features and remove or combine highly correlated
    features such as [ (flag)_(S0), (dst)_(host)_(srv)_(serror)_(rate), (dst)_(host)_(serror)_(rate),
    (dst)_(host)_(same)_(srv)_(rate)]. The resulting feature set after pre-processing
    phase is shown in Table 4. Table 3. Top 20 feature sets of high correlation with
    target. Index Feature Name Correlation with Target 1 (flag)_(SF) 0.756285 2 (same)_(srv)_(rate)

    Data balancing stage After cleaning and pre-processing, the resulting dataset
    includes two classes: 0 for the Benign class and 1 for the attack class. The ratio
    of the number of records for each class in the training and testing dataset is
    shown in Fig. 3. The Figure shows that the resulting dataset suffers from an imbalance
    problem since the number of records belonging to the Normal class is larger (67,342)
    compared to that of instances in the attack class (58,630). To address this problem,
    Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique Evaluation (SMOTE) is applied to handle
    the imbalance classes problem. SMOTE is one of the most successful methods used
    in different practical applications. SMOTE generates new records of the minority
    class by interpolation, it uses the average of some instances in the normal class
    for the creation of new samples for that class. After this step, we can ensure
    that the percentage of the normal attack classes is 1 to 1. Download : Download

    in Training and Testing set. 4.3. Feature selection stage Feature selection is
    a crucial stage in detecting malicious network flow more accurately. If the feature
    selector module is ignored from machine learning pipelines, wrong classification
    and long training time would be possible. Deep discussions regarding the cruciality
    of the feature selection process for attack detection are shown in [50]. The authors
    reported that applying feature selection helped to reduce training and testing
    time and increase the performance of models. Recursive feature elimination (RFE)
    is adopted in this work to select the most discriminative feature set. RFE algorithm
    belongs to the wrapper-based attribute selection approach. It works by adopting
    a search mechanism to make the feature set the most minimum while preserving the
    discrimination ability of the features. The RFE technique starts by learning an
    initial feature set, then weights are assigned to the trained features, and finally,
    features whose weights value are minimum are ignored. This process is repeated
    until the algorithm reaches the most discriminating set of attributes. The resulting
    feature set can produce the best performance of the proposed model while consuming
    the least computation time. In each iteration of the RFE algorithm, an ML model
    is applied for record partitioning. Selecting the appropriate model to enhance
    the stability of the selection process. This work applies a random forest classifier
    because the features are related to the target in a non-linear form. Finally,
    RFE partition records of the dataset depending on the column of the class label
    [51]. The RFE algorithm reduces the feature set to 9 input features, shown in
    Table 5. Table 5. Reduced feature set after applying the RFE algorithm. Index

    9 (srv)_(rerror)_(rate) 4.4. Tabular transformation into images This stage aims
    to generate an appropriate input for the intrusion detector module as the NSL-KDD
    dataset contains tabular data. The proposed methodology uses CNN models for the
    detection process. The network traffic needs to be transformed to images that
    are the most proper input format for CNN architectures [52]. First, data is normalized
    to the pixel range to be ready for data transformation. The data is normalized
    by converting features such that the values should also be normalized into the
    scale of 0–255 because image pixels range from 0 to 255. The data samples are
    chunked depending on the feature sizes of network traffic datasets after data
    normalization. As the used NSL-KDD dataset contains nine essential features, 27
    consecutive records, each with nine features (27×9 = 243 feature values in total)
    is converted into an image with the dimensions 9 × 9 × 3. Thus, each modified
    picture is a three-channel square color image (red, green, and blue). After that,
    the transformed images are labeled depending on the attack patterns in the data
    chunks. This image is called \"Normal\" if all chunk samples are normal. If not,
    the image is marked as a threat to the chunk. The final sets of modified images
    are used as input for CNN models. Fig. 4 depicts the typical samples for each
    of the two groups in the NSL KDD dataset. Download : Download high-res image (211KB)

    each class. 4.5. CNN classification stage After tabular data is converted to images,
    different CNN models are applied to the produced images without any additional
    processing. Fig. 5 shows a general architecture of CNN that can be applied to
    the transformed input images. The typical CNN architecture comprises a series
    of convolution-pooling layers that end with fully connected layers. The convolutional
    layers automatically extract features representing normal and attack network flow
    from the images. The pooling layers help reduce data while preserving important
    features and avoiding the overfitting problem of the CNN models. Finally, fully-connected
    layers connect all features and apply activation functions (sigmoid or softmax)
    to produce either normal or attached output classes. Download : Download high-res

    for intrusion detection after tabular conversion to images. The proposed IDS architecture
    applied CNN models that are based on learning transfer. The selected CNN models
    are pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. Three different models are selected:
    VGG16, Exception, and Inception model, because of their success in different image
    classification tasks [53]. The VGG16 network contains five blocks of convolutional
    layers and three fully connected layers. The Inception model extracts features
    that combine different contexts to form various feature patterns. The Exception
    model extends the Inception network that changes the conventional convolution
    layers to different convolutions that are depth-wise and separable. 4.6. PSO for
    optimizing CNN hyperparameters CNN models have a set of hyperparameters which
    is crucial to tune to get a high-performance detection model and affect the structure
    of the applied CNN models. There are two categories of hyperparameters. The hyperparameters
    in the first category are adapted while designing the model, such as the number
    of frozen layers, the dropout ratio, and the learning rate. However, the hyperparameters
    in the second category are considered the keys to improving performance while
    decreasing training time, such as the number of epochs, early stop patience, and
    batch size. One of the Common hyperparameter optimization algorithms is Particle
    swarm optimization (PSO) which can be categorized as a population-based and meta-heuristic
    optimization technique. It has fast convergence (time complexity is O(NlogN))
    and enables parallelization because particles operate independently. It is based
    on information sharing and cooperation between particles in a swarm. Additionally,
    PSO is applicable for various types of hyper-parameters, which makes it an appropriate
    choice in the proposed methodology. Fig. 6 shows the steps of applying the PSO
    technique for optimizing the hyperparameters of the VGG16 model. Download : Download
    high-res image (549KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 6. The flowchart
    of PSO-based hyperparameters optimization of the VGG16 model. In PSO, a particle
    group scans the search space semi-randomly. Each particle in the swarm has three
    attributes: current particle position, current velocity, and best particle position.
    The particles in the PSO algorithm need initialization of the position and velocity,
    which is an important factor for avoiding the local minimum problem. After that,
    the algorithm calculates two attributes for each particle: current particle position
    and performance score, which are used to update the velocity of each particle,
    and results in their moving according to the updated velocity vectors. The PSO
    works in an iterative way where the previously mentioned steps continue until
    a particularly accepted convergence [54]. Finally, the particles get closer to
    the promising regions, then stop when a global optimum is reached. 5. Evaluation
    and discussion This paper uses the”NSL-KDD” dataset to evaluate the proposed model.
    We calculated various performance metrics such as accuracy, F1 Score, Precision,
    and Recall which are given below. The evaluation experiments have been run on
    MacBook Pro with 2.6 GHz Intel Core i7 (4 cores, 6 MB cache) processing units,
    Radeon Pro 450 2048 MB, and Intel HD Graphics 530 with 1536 MB graphics and has
    16GB DDR3 (2133 MHz) of RAM(Random Access Memory). 5.1. Dataset description The
    experiments in this study are based on (the NSL-KDD) dataset, which consists of
    internet traffic samples encountered by a real Intrusion Detection System. The
    dataset is a refined version of the KDD‘99 Dataset. It is used as benchmark data
    to evaluate various intrusion detection methods on modern-day network systems.
    The dataset contains four subsets: KDDTrain+, KDDTest+, KDDTrain+_20Percent, and
    KDDTest+_20Percent. The first two subsets contain all the train and test sets,
    while the latter contains only 20% of the train and test sets. For this experiment,
    we will use the KDDTrain+ and KDDTest+ datasets. The dataset presents 43 columns,
    out of which the ‘attack’ field contains the type of attacks detected in the network.
    The score is a field denoting the difficulty level and a binary class attack that
    classifies if there has been any attack on the traffic input. There are 22 types
    and a normal value for no attack, as shown in Table 6. Each attack type is classified
    into four categories: DOS, Probe, Privilege, and Access. The classifications are
    shown in Table 6. Table 6, we can notice that the Denial of Service attack is
    the most popular post popular with higher frequency. Table 6. Types of network
    attacks. Index Attack Type Number of instances Attack category 0 Normal flow 67,342

    The confusion matrix is used as the classification metric of the applied models.
    The confusion matrix consists of four values: True Positive (TP), False Negative
    (FN), False Positive (FP), and True Negative (TN). They are defined as follows:
    1 True Positive (TP): represent the evaluation result that detects the intrusion
    in the smart farm network if the intrusion exists. The TP value is at the entry
    [0][0] in the confusion matrix. 2 False Negative (FN): represent the evaluation
    result that does not detect the intrusion even if the intrusion does not exist
    in the smart farm network. The FN value is at the entry [1][0] in the confusion
    matrix 3 False Positive (FP) (AKA False Alarm rate): represent the evaluation
    result that detects the intrusion in the smart farm network when the intrusion
    does not exist. The FP value is at the entry [0][1] in the confusion matrix. 4
    True Negative (TN): represent the evaluation result that does not detect the intrusion
    even if there is no intrusion in the smart farm network. The TN value is in the
    confusion matrix''s entry [1][1]. The Performance of the proposed network IDS
    in smart farming architecture can be measured using accuracy (A), Precision (P),
    Recall (R), and F1 Score (F1) as the performance indicators for the proposed classification
    method 1 Accuracy (A). The proportion of the total number of correct predictions.
    The formula of accuracy is calculated by: (1) 2 Recall (R) (AKA Sensitivity and
    True Positive Rate) The ratio of the total number of attack samples that are correctly
    recognized divided by the total number of attack samples. It is an appropriate
    metric to use to reduce false negatives. The formula of Recall is given by: (2)
    1 Precision (P). Calculated by dividing the number of true positives by adding
    the number of true positives and the number of false positives. It is a good indicator
    to use when focusing on limiting false positives. The formula of Precision is
    given by: (3) 2 F1 Score (F1). The harmonic mean of the Recall and Precision.
    It analyzes false positives and false negatives. It gives good results when dealing
    with an imbalanced dataset. The formula for the F1 score is given by: (4) 5.3.
    Discussion, results and analysis The detection capability of the proposed framework
    is first evaluated by applying different base CNN models (VGG16, Xception, Inception)
    with default hyperparameter values. The results of evaluating the three applied
    CNN models on the NSL-KDD dataset are shown in Table 7. As shown in Table 7, the
    VGG16 method shows the best performance by achieving 97.89% accuracy with 3.61%
    and 41.3% accuracy improvement compared to Inception and Xception models. Additionally,
    results obtained by applying VGG16 achieve 97.88% F1-score with 3.67% and 47.38%
    superiority, contrasting with the Inception and Xception models. Fig. 7 shows
    the confusion matrix of each of the applied three CNN models on the converted
    images with default hyperparameters values. Table 7. Evaluation of base CNN models

    model. The results of the optimized VGG16 model are shown in Table 10. As shown
    in Table 10, the optimized VGG16 model achieves high accuracy, Precision, and
    Recall of 99.99% and 100% F1-scores after data is transformed. Then PSO algorithm
    is applied. Moreover, the results in the Table indicate that the optimized VGG16
    model has at least 2.1% superiority in both accuracy and F1 score compared to
    the VGG16 model with default parameters. Additionally, Among the two models shown
    in Table 8, the proposed optimized VGG16-PSO method gives the best performance
    by achieving at least 1.73% and 1.74% accuracy and F1-score improvements, respectively,
    compared with optimized VGG16 using the Random Search algorithm. that means the
    optimized VGG16 model with PSO algorithm outperform both the conventional VGG16
    model and the optimized VGG16 model with random search method. Table 10. Evaluation

    work has been made on the test set of the NSL-KDD dataset using accuracy, Precision,
    Recall, and the F1 score in Table 11. The proposed approach has obtained satisfactory
    results, and class imbalance, feature selection, feature transformation, and parameter
    tuning play a crucial role in achieving high performance. Most previous works
    have not addressed the issues of the imbalanced dataset and dealing with the full
    feature set, thereby being unable to get high performance on the specified dataset.
    Most of the earlier results reported accuracy ranging from 80% to 91%, as shown
    in Table 11. Table 11. Accuracy of different models in literature and Proposed

    is essential to the country''s economic health since it is the main food source
    for everyone. It links a wide range of businesses around the country. A country
    with a large agricultural industry is considered economically and socially prosperous.
    In the majority of nations, agriculture is an essential source of employment.
    Smart farming [66] is the latest technological breakthrough for the agricultural
    sector''s sustainable food production. Smart farms become possible only with the
    emergence of the IoT and ML [67]. Numerous advantages emerge from the IoT network,
    such as improved efficiency, cost optimization, optimum energy use, forecasting,
    and public comfort. The variety of data processing technologies and processes
    causes reliability and security concerns, hampering the widespread application
    of the Internet of things in farming. This paper presents a technique for detecting
    intrusions into agricultural IoT networks using image-based features and deep
    learning models. An optimized VGG 16 model has a Precision F1 score, and accuracy
    is better than 99%. In the future, we will consider using different DNN models
    with different architectures to evaluate the proposed method rather than pre-trained
    models. Additionally, we will consider different recent datasets for analyzing
    different feature sets. Declaration of Competing Interest There is NO conflict
    of Interest. Data availability Data will be made available on request. References

  description: Global agricultural production is currently limited by negative climate-related
    hazards such as drought, uneven rainfall and rising temperatures. Many efforts
    have been put in place by government and non-government agencies to mitigate the
    challenges of climate change in the sector. However, the approaches do not seem
    feasible due to the growing demand for food. With these challenges, climate-smart
    agricultural technologies such as aeroponics and underutilised crops have been
    projected as the future of agriculture in developing African countries to reduce
    the risk of food insecurity. In this paper, we present the cultivation of an underutilised
    indigenous African legume crop, Bambara groundnut, in an aeroponics system. Seventy
    Bambara groundnut landraces were cultivated in a low-cost climate-smart aeroponics
    system and in sawdust media. The results showed that Bambara groundnut landraces
    cultivated in aeroponics performed better than those cultivated in a traditional
    hydroponics (sawdust/drip irrigation) technique in terms of plant height and chlorophyll
    content, where the landraces cultivated in sawdust had a higher number of leaves
    than those cultivated in aeroponics. This study also demonstrated the feasibility
    of introducing a generic Internet of Things platform for climate-smart agriculture
    in developing countries. The proof-of-concept and the successful cultivation of
    a hypogeal crop in aeroponics can be useful for cost-effective adaptation and
    mitigation plans for climate change, particularly for food security in rural African
    agricultural sectors.

    crops 1. Introduction The global population has rapidly increased in the last
    century to over 8 billion people today. The global population is projected to
    be 9.7 billion by 2050, with most of the population growth taking place in Sub-Saharan
    Africa [1]. In conjunction with population growth, dietary changes due to higher
    per capita income and increased use of bioenergy will become major contributors
    to the growth of global agricultural demand [2,3]. There is some debate on the
    future agricultural demand, with predictions of increases between 60% and 110%
    by 2050 [4,5]. Sub-Saharan Africa has historically lagged behind the developed
    world in terms of agricultural advancements. It is generally accepted that agricultural
    intensification and the expansion of agricultural lands could allow the industry
    to meet global demand, but with certain environmental trade-offs [[6], [7], [8]].
    For example, agricultural intensification leads to decreased soil health, loss
    of insect biodiversity, and increased greenhouse gas emissions, amongst other
    effects [3,[9], [10], [11], [12]]. In developing countries, agricultural output
    is predominantly increased by expansion but most of the agricultural expansion
    takes place in the tropics, forests and rainforests. According to Ref. [13] approximately
    49–80% of new croplands are replacing forests, with the largest (34%) cropland
    expansion being on the African continent. It is therefore pertinent that new,
    sustainable, and innovative solutions are directed at developing countries, especially
    Africa, in order to increase the agricultural output, while also conserving the
    environment in the light of global climatic change [14,15]. 1.1. Africa: climate
    change and agricultural production Bearing in mind the high levels of inequality
    and poverty on the African continent, it has been reported that climate change
    has contributed to many countries’ challenges because it negatively affects available
    water resources for agricultural activities [16,17]. Many farmers in southern
    Africa are practicing agriculture in rural areas at a small scale and at subsistence
    level, with minimal or no resources or inputs [16,18]. Although small-scale farming
    has been recognised as a path out of poverty, especially in Africa [19], global
    climate variability is changing this perspective and strategies to cope with the
    impact of climate change in the agricultural industry on the continent are necessary
    [18] to enable #Zero hunger by 2030. However, since Africa is one of the most
    food insecure continents, it is anticipated that it will be difficult to totally
    eliminate hunger by 2030 [19]. This is because its agricultural production is
    heavily reliant on rain for irrigation, whereby 95% of the production is rainfed
    [20]. The frequency and intensity in the occurrences of droughts, increasing temperatures,
    and uneven rainfall patterns are all climatic variables that are currently limiting
    agricultural productivity in Africa [21]. These challenges will only increase
    chronic food insecurity due to the ever-increasing demand for food, which is expected
    to double by 2050 [20]. [22] indicated that temperatures on the African continent
    will continue to rise faster than the global average, and it is predicted that
    this will continue as long as greenhouse gas emissions are not controlled [16].
    Although Africa is responsible for less than 4% of all greenhouse gas emissions
    globally, it is by far the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change [[22],
    [23], [24], [25]]. It is predicted that most parts of the African continent will
    experience much drier conditions [17,26,27]. The vulnerability of the agricultural
    industry to climate change has, in the last decade, increased food insecurity
    [17,19,28]. As such, the current evident effects of climate change on the industry
    have motivated an important change in agricultural research [29,30], for instance,
    looking into climate-smart technologies that conserve water and the planet [15,16,[31],
    [32], [33]]. However, the limited capacity and inaccessibility of resources on
    the continent to adapt to the negative effects of climate change and variability
    limit agricultural productivity [34]. In some African countries (i.e., South Africa,
    Zimbabwe, Tanzania, Lesotho, Ethiopia) policies and coping strategies have been
    made available to farmers [35], but adoption largely depends on the farmers’ willingness
    to participate [31,36,37]. Nonetheless, available land for agricultural purposes
    is declining with the rising population, water scarcity, land degradation, and
    increasing soil erosion [16,17]. This challenge points the agricultural industry
    towards climate-smart cultivation practices [[31], [32], [33]]. Soilless agricultural
    technologies cause less greenhouse gas emissions than traditional conventional
    farming practices [38] as these technologies produce crops using less space and
    water, reduce toxic mineral waste runoff, and have the ability to improve the
    ecological footprint [32]. 1.2. 4th Industrial Revolution: climate-smart technologies,
    internet of things, and agriculture The world is currently undergoing a 4th Industrial
    Revolution (4IR), which is characterised by the fusion of physical, digital, and
    biological systems at a pace that has never been seen before [39]. In agriculture,
    climate-smart technologies are viewed as an important level in the maintenance
    of the global food nutrition and security in this new era of climate change [39,40].
    The Internet of Things (IoT) has played a substantial role in enabling this paradigm
    shift by enabling the wireless connection of machinery and sensors with each other
    and with the internet. The introduction of IoT into agriculture is allowing a
    more data-driven approach, simultaneously leading to cost-effective management
    of farms and a reduced environmental impact [40]. This could be a way to fundamentally
    change existing agricultural practices to be more efficient and more sustainable.
    Unfortunately, the cost of current IoT solutions is preventing many small-scale
    farmers, including those in developing countries from using this technology. IoT
    monitoring solutions do exist, but they are scarce and expensive since they are
    meant for large-scale high-tech operations. However, it is the rural small-scale
    farmers that can benefit the most from IoT solutions, since they have the largest
    gap between attained yield and theoretical yield [14,[41], [42], [43], [44]].
    Solutions are being developed for large-scale, high-tech operations like those
    seen in developed countries where the attained yield is approaching the theoretical
    yield. In addition to smart technologies, food production can further be intensified
    with the use of soilless cultivation – one of the fastest growing water-wise agricultural
    technologies globally [45]. 1.3. Soilless cultivation: aeroponics and hypogeal
    crops Soilless cultivation such as hydroponics, aeroponics and aquaponics have
    proven to have the capacity to solve challenges that limit agricultural productivity
    as they all promote sustainable agriculture [38,45]. Aeroponics is one soilless
    cultivation technique in which plant roots are suspended in the air as there is
    no rooting substrate [46]. [47] reported that aeroponics allows for the total
    control of root zone nutrition, temperature, moisture and gaseous phase. As root
    zone temperature and nutrition can be controlled in aeroponics, it will be impractical
    to control moisture and the gaseous phase in hydroponics [46]. As aeroponics offers
    a non-invasive way to study plant roots it enables the study of the roots’ response
    to drought during plant development, an important feature because it is an expected
    consequence of climate change. Our global food system is currently dominated by
    three crops, maize, wheat and rice, where these crops account for 50% of the worlds
    food production [48]. This poses a significant risk to food supplies throughout
    the world, as climate change-related hazards are currently extreme and increasing
    [49]. The Food and Agriculture Organization is proposing the move towards a direction
    of nutrition-sensitive agriculture using approaches that seek to ensure the production
    of a variety of affordable, nutritious, culturally appropriate food that sustainably
    meets dietary needs [50]. In this study, we designed and developed a low-cost
    IoT-enabled solar-powered aeroponics system as a proof-of-concept for the cultivation
    of a hypogeal legume, Bambara groundnut (Vigna subterranea (L.) Verdc.), which
    is an underutilised and neglected African crop. The incorporation of orphan and
    underutilised crops into the mainstream agriculture can diversify the global agricultural
    system, as they have shown to be more nutritionally dense and resilient to climate
    change [49,51,52]. The often-neglected Bambara groundnut has been referred to
    as a crop of the future [52]. It is a great source of high-quality protein that
    is protein is rich in the amino acid lysine [53,54]. Being highly nutritious,
    it has the potential of playing a critical role in improving the global economy
    and food security system [55,56]. In developing countries orphan and underutilised
    crops are often cultivated in marginal soils by poor resourced farmers [55], as
    they require little or no input in their production cycle. Nonetheless, there
    is limited literature on the effects of climate change on the cultivation or possible
    production using climate-smart agricultural systems for Bambara groundnut. Therefore,
    the information presented in this study, will be vital, not only in the promotion
    of Bambara groundnut, but also promote the cultivation of alternative crops for
    climate change adaptation in sub-Saharan Africa. This is the first account of
    the successful (to maturity) cultivation of a hypogeal legume in aeroponics. 2.
    Materials and methods 2.1. Plant material and study site description Seventy Bambara
    groundnut landraces were used in this study. The seeds were sourced from different
    subsistence farmers in Limpopo Province, South Africa (Location: 23.4013°S, 29.4179°E).
    Seeds were separated according to the IPGRI Bambara groundnut descriptors. For
    the purposes of this first report, we randomly selected 25% (18) of the 70 the
    landraces’ data to present (Fig. 1). The study was performed at an Experimental
    Farm in a tunnel from December 2021 to May 2022. Daily minimum and maximum temperature
    averages ranged from 10 to 34 °C (data was obtained from the sensors in the IoT
    system). Download : Download high-res image (635KB) Download : Download full-size

    aeroponics system design The system consisted of 30 units, with the lid of each
    growing tank designed to accommodate 12 plants (Fig. 2a). Each unit was a black
    160 L tote storage bin with holes on the side to allow 20 mm pipes into the tank,
    with six (50 μm droplet) misting sprinklers attached on the pipe sections that
    were inside the bins (Fig. 2b). A 0.75 kW pump was connected to a 5000 L reservoir
    tank holding the nutrient solution, which contained a modified Hoagland solution
    with a ratio of 1 N:2.4 K [57]. The nutrient solution was prepared from peanut
    (Arachis hypogea) fertiliser recommendation. This was done as they are both hypogeal
    plants and currently there is no fertiliser recommendation for Bambara groundnut
    from government or private agencies. The pH of the nutrient solution was maintained
    at 5.5 to 6.0, and it was measured daily and corrected if necessary, using 1 N
    KOH or 1 N H2SO4. The EC of the solution during the study ranged from 1.2 dS/m
    to 1.3 dS/m. Download : Download high-res image (539KB) Download : Download full-size

    of the holes on lids of the growth bins, and b) indicating how the irrigation
    was set up inside the bins (not drawn to scale and some components are not shown,
    e.g., drainage lines and power source). This nutrient solution was pumped from
    the 5000 L tank through an inlet pipe that allowed the fog misters to spray the
    roots of the plants inside the totes (Fig. 2). The nutrient solution was supplied
    through a misting schedule of 15 s every 20 min from 8 am to 8 pm. Irrigation
    was suspended at night, as the stomata close to avoid the loss of water when plants
    are not photosynthesising. Excess nutrient solution in each of the units drained
    through an outlet at the bottom of each bin, connected to 20 mm drainage pipes,
    which led to a 120 L drainage tank. Once the drained solution had reached a certain
    level in the 120 L drainage tank, a valve opened, and a 0.75 kW pump returned
    the drained nutrient solution to the reservoir tank. Plants were inspected daily
    for pests and diseases, while the nutrient solution was refreshed every two weeks
    to avoid the over accumulation of nutrients, and to prevent bacterial and fungal
    growth in the nutrient reservoir tank. 2.3. Experimental design and procedure

    comparative purposes, landraces were planted in traditional drip irrigation hydroponics
    in sawdust media in 10.5 L bags (Fig. 5). Five seedlings from each landrace (350
    plants) were arranged in a complete randomised block design. Nutrient solution
    was the same for both systems, but the irrigation scheduling in the sawdust was
    2 min, every 4 h from 8 am to 4 pm daily. The irrigation in the sawdust, was suspended
    for 4 h between irrigation intervals. This was done to avoid the sawdust becoming
    damp because it would attract fungal gnats [58] that feed on plant roots. Download

    of Things (IoT) system Temperature control inside the tunnel was achieved with
    an extraction fan on the eastern side and a wet wall on the western side. These
    two were switched synchronously to regulate the temperature inside the tunnel.
    Prior to this trial, these two actuators were operated manually. The IoT solution
    was developed to automate the temperature control by switching of the fan and
    the wet-wall pump. The switching algorithm, which is implemented on a Raspberry
    Pi (a small computer), has three DHT22 sensors that measure both temperature and
    humidity (one of each placed on the eastern extremity, middle of the tunnel, and
    western extremity) for the sensing, and a solid-state relay (SSR) for the switching
    (Fig. 6). Download : Download high-res image (330KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 6. IoT System diagram showing sensing, control and data collection
    (not drawn to scale). The middle temperature reading was used to control the actuation
    switches to concurrently control the fan and the wet wall pump. After trial-and-error
    testing, an upper threshold of 30 °C to turn the fan and the wet-wall on, and
    a lower threshold of 22 °C to turn the fan and the wet-wall off produced the most
    efficient autonomous operation. The upper and lower thresholds produced a “dead
    band” that avoids repeatedly turning the fan and the wet wall on and off in quick
    succession. The Raspberry Pi aggregates all the sensor data every 5 min and sends
    it to a Telegram bot via cellular connection, and records locally in a Comma Separated
    Value (CSV) file. The main purpose of the Telegram bot was to provide near real
    time data of the tunnel''s characteristics to assist in decision making for the
    trial. At the end of each day, the locally saved CSV file was uploaded to Dropbox
    where we could download and analyse the day''s data (see example Fig. 7). Download

    on or off. 2.5. Data collection and analysis The following parameters were recorded
    20 days after transplanting, then every two weeks for six weeks: (i) plant height
    (PH) was measured from the base to the highest point of the plant (cm); (ii) number
    of leaves (NL) was counted from fully developed trifoliate leaves; and (iii) Chlorophyll
    content (CC) was measured using an AtLeaf digital chlorophyll meter (AtLeaf CHL
    PLUS, FT Green LLC, DE, United States). The AtLeaf chlorophyll meter is an inexpensive
    instrument with readings strongly correlated to the SPAD chlorophyll meter [59].
    The data was tested for normality and was found to be normally distributed (Table
    1) and was therefore subjected to repeated measures ANOVA. Table 1. Test for normality

    Bambara groundnut landraces were compared using the Lavene and Barlett tests for
    homogeneity, whose assumptions of were violated at p < 0.0001. This was then followed
    by Welch''s F test to determine whether there were any differences between the
    BGN landraces for a given trait within and between treatments (aeroponics and
    sawdust). Least significance difference was accepted at p < 0.05. Analyses were
    conducted in R Studio version 4.1 2 (R Core team, R Foundation for statistical
    computing, Vienn, Austria). 3. Results There were no significant differences in
    plant height between the BGN landraces grown in aeroponics and sawdust (Welch''s
    F = 0,0515; p > 0,821). Plant height ranged from 18 to 35 cm in the aeroponics
    system and 15–38 cm in the sawdust (Fig. 8). In the aeroponics system, BGN 14
    had the lowest plant height at week 2 and gradually increased between weeks 4–12
    (Fig. 8a), while in the sawdust, BGN 6 recorded the lowest plant height (Fig.
    8b). It was observed that BGN 52 recorded the highest plant height across all
    sampling times (week 2–12) in both the aeroponics and sawdust (Fig. 8a and b).

    week 6, there was a decrease in the chlorophyll content in both the aeroponics

    4. Discussion This study presented the first cultivation of an underutilised and
    hypogeal African legume, the Bambara groundnut, in an aeroponics (Fig. 11a) and
    traditional sawdust drip irrigation hydroponics (Fig. 11b). There are no records
    in literature for either medium relating to the cultivation of this crop. We also
    presented the coupling of an accessible IoT platform that can easily be scaled
    up to control temperature and humidity in tunnel environments. The IoT platform
    was successful in monitoring and controlling the tunnel environmental (temperature
    and humidity) conditions in the tunnel. Download : Download high-res image (1MB)
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 11. Bambara groundnut pod development
    in a) aeroponics and b) sawdust media. Plants were mounded with sawdust. This
    is an agricultural practice that improves pod development in Bambara groundnut,
    as pod development and enlargement is sensitive to long photoperiod. The repeated
    measures ANOVA indicated that plant height, number of leaves, and chlorophyll
    content were landrace dependent. The number of leaves was significantly higher
    in the sawdust-grown landraces than in the aeroponics system. In aeroponics, the
    nutrient solution was supplied in the form of a misting set intervals, which may
    have limited aboveground biomass but improved root growth and development. This
    might have been a response of the landraces in aeroponics to adapt to water deficit
    during the misting intervals. Plant height comparison between aeroponics and sawdust
    showed no statistical significance, possibly indicating that adaptability in different
    growing conditions. Moreover, the chlorophyll content in the landraces grown in
    the aeroponics system much higher than of those grown in sawdust [60]. reported
    that Bambara groundnut landraces with a high chlorophyll would have a much higher
    photosynthetic potential, which normally leads to a greater plant growth rate
    and performance. Sawdust physiochemical properties change over time during plant
    growth, which could have directly influenced the chlorophyll content in the plants
    because the decomposing sawdust may have been competing for nutrients, especially
    nitrogen. Though not tested, observations suggested that Bambara groundnut has
    the ability to tolerate and survive under heat stress. Heat stress is one of the
    abiotic environmental factors that are known to severely affect physiological
    aspects in plants. It is important to note that there was a general reduction
    in chlorophyll content during week 6 in all the landraces (Fig. 10), which may
    have been due to the plants experiencing abnormally high temperatures (averaging
    45 °C–55 °C) in the tunnel as a result of faults with the electrical supply at
    the experimental site. The significant decline in the chlorophyll content in week
    6 can suggest that there was possible structural damage to the chloroplasts of
    the plants. However, this decline in the chlorophyll content could have also been
    a protective response against heat stress [61]. The rate in the possible protective
    response mechanism in the Bambara groundnut landraces could be an important indicator
    to target landraces for heat stress tolerance breeding. 5. Conclusions This study
    has demonstrated that Bambara groundnut cultivation is possible in both aeroponics
    and traditional drip-irrigated hydroponics (sawdust). From this study, it can
    be concluded that aeroponics was beneficial to Bambara groundnut plant height
    and chlorophyll content, but not all landraces performed the same within and between
    systems. The different growth responses of landraces in both systems justifies
    the need to understand the anatomical, physiological and genetic mechanisms of
    individual landraces. In addition, future research should focus on the yield performance
    of the different Bambara groundnut landraces in aeroponics. Climate change adaptation
    and mitigation strategies such as climate smart-agricultural technologies need
    to be extensively explored for farmers in countries where water scarcity and arable
    land for agricultural purposes are depleting. With aeroponics and hydroponics,
    water is usually recirculated, meaning that a fixed volume of water can be used
    during the planting season, in turn addressing water conservation and efficient
    water usage practices. By being able to use IoT in controlling the temperature
    and humidity, this research most likely used water more efficiently. The aeroponics
    and IoT systems are proposed as a solution to provide subsistence farmers in rural
    communities with an alternative and sustainable method of cultivating underutilised
    crops to support themselves and their communities. The system is also suitable
    for individuals and companies who want to shorten the value chain from farm to
    fork. The target environments within which the system may be utilised demands
    certain characteristics, which are as follows. • Low cost: the system is meant
    to support rural communities, who do not have a lot of disposable income. The
    system must be inexpensive to be a feasible replacement for current practices.
    • Durable: the system could operate outside for long periods, exposed to extreme
    weather conditions and replacing components periodically should be cost-effective.
    • Easy to use: many farmers are unfamiliar with aeroponics and might be reluctant
    to adopt it if it is difficult to operate or assemble. Having the system be easy
    to use could increase its attractiveness to farmers looking for alternative solutions.

  description: Food security, poverty reduction, and rural livelihood support are
    all greatly impacted by agriculture. To fight crop damage and water scarcity,
    a smart agricultural system built on the Internet of Things has been created.
    The system keeps an eye on the water and soil moisture levels and guards against
    unauthorized animal entry. Cell phones can be used by users to get real-time data.
    The water pump operates automatically on and off depending on criteria measured
    on the farmland. For the benefit of farmers and rural communities, the solution
    attempts to maximize irrigation, protect crops, and increase agricultural output.
    This smart farming system uses technology to give farmers and rural communities
    a dependable and effective tool that has a favorable effect on agricultural activity.
    A revolutionary solution that reduces risks and boosts productivity in the agricultural
    industry is offered through the use of IoT technology. The approach greatly enhances
    food security, promotes sustainable development in rural regions, and benefits
    farmers' well-being.

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Trichy, India SECTION I. Introduction IoT
    has had a significant impact on many different industries, revolutionizing our
    daily lives and work practices. IoT devices in the healthcare industry [10] allow
    for real-time tracking of medication adherence, vital signs, and remote patient
    monitoring. As a result, patient care is enhanced, early intervention is made
    easier, and hospital readmissions are decreased. Smart traffic management systems
    [11] that optimize flow, reduce congestion, and improve road safety are an advantage
    of IoT for the transportation sector. Supply chain management is improved by IoT-enabled
    tracking devices, which also ensure effective logistics and reduce loss and theft.
    IoT enables smart factories and predictive maintenance programs in the manufacturing
    industry [12]. Proactive maintenance is made possible by real-time monitoring
    of equipment via connected sensors, which reduces downtime and increases operational
    efficiency. IoT-based smart farming systems [13], [14] are used in agriculture
    to keep an eye on crop health, soil moisture, and environmental conditions. This
    data-driven strategy supports sustainable agricultural methods, improves crop
    output, and optimizes irrigation. Smart cities use IoT [15] to manage resources
    effectively, including waste management, energy use, and public services. Intelligent
    sensors and data analytics increase energy efficiency, urban planning, and the
    quality of life for residents. IoT has a broad impact across industries, spurring
    innovation and enhancing productivity [2]. IoT has the ability to revolutionize
    industries and open up new opportunities as it develops. The influence of IOT
    has increased significantly since 2018 according to GlobalData''s Technology Intelligence
    Centre [1]. Figure 1 illustrates this clearly. Fig. 1. Growth of iot sector Show
    All The importance of agriculture cannot be overstated, particularly in light
    of the growing world population. It is essential for guaranteeing food security,
    fostering economic expansion, creating jobs, and advancing sustainable practices
    for the benefit of current and future generations. The implementation of an IoT-based
    smart farming system provides several benefits: A. Detection of Excessive Salt
    Content The system is designed to identify high salt levels in water, which can
    negatively impact plant growth. This capability ensures that plants receive water
    with an optimal salt concentration, promoting healthy growth and preventing damage.
    B. Monitoring of Soil Moisture, Humidity and Temperature The system continuously
    monitors soil moisture, humidity, and temperature levels. Based on these measurements,
    it automatically activates the irrigation system, ensuring that plants receive
    adequate water at the right time to optimize growth and yield. C. Wildlife Intrusion
    Detection The smart agricultural system incorporates sensors to detect the presence
    of wild animals entering the farm. When an intrusion is detected, the system promptly
    alerts farmers, enabling them to take necessary action to prevent crop damage
    and protect their yield. By combining these functionalities, the smart agricultural
    system enables efficient resource management, enhances plant health, and mitigates
    potential risks to crop production. It leverages IoT technology to provide real-time
    data, automation, and proactive notifications, empowering farmers to make informed
    decisions and optimize their farming operations. SECTION II. Related Works S.
    Senthil et.al, utilized a range of sensors alongside IoT technology to enable
    intelligent irrigation of agricultural land [3]. The system effectively employed
    measurements of soil moisture content, atmospheric humidity, and temperature values
    to optimize the irrigation process. Soil moisture sensors accurately determined
    soil moisture levels, guiding the system in initiating irrigation only when necessary
    to avoid over or under watering. Additionally, sensors monitoring atmospheric
    humidity and temperature provided valuable insights, enabling the system to adjust
    irrigation schedules based on prevailing weather conditions. Real-time data collection
    and processing, facilitated by IoT, allowed for swift decision-making and automation
    of the irrigation process. The system autonomously controlled irrigation valves
    or alerted farmers when action was required. S. Heble and colleagues [4] carry
    out similar type of research. P. Supanirattisai et al. leveraged IoT, LoRaWAN,
    cloud storage, and a customized dashboard to automate agricultural irrigation
    by monitoring humidity and temperature [5]. This innovative solution provided
    real-time data access, analysis, and visualization, empowering farmers with valuable
    insights for effective decision-making in irrigation management. L. Kumar et al.
    successfully employed webcam technology and a dedicated mobile app to remotely
    monitor agricultural fields, deterring unauthorized access [6]. By leveraging
    cloud storage, the collected data became a valuable resource for analyzing and
    enhancing farm security. This innovative approach provided farmers with an efficient
    and effective means of protecting their agricultural assets. Similar system was
    implemented by S. Mishra et.al, [7] A drone [8] was deployed by M. A. Al-Shareeda
    et.al, to collect farm data, specifically soil humidity, from ground sensors strategically
    installed throughout the farm by the farmer. This data was utilized to determine
    the precise areas requiring irrigation. The drone was equipped with a spraying
    mechanism for accurate water delivery to the identified locations, optimizing
    irrigation efficiency and water usage. Furthermore, the drone performed the task
    of dispersing seeds across the farm, ensuring uniform distribution for effective
    planting. By integrating drone technology, a streamlined process was achieved,
    utilizing real-time data for automating irrigation and seeding operations, resulting
    in improved resource management and crop growth. R. Dagar et,al, proposed an IoT
    model [9] which employs air temperature, soil moisture, and humidity sensors.
    These sensors collect data and transmit it via Wi-Fi to a central server. The
    server analyzes the information and initiates actions accordingly. While this
    model outlines a basic architecture, real implementations can be more intricate,
    providing enhanced functionality and decision-making capabilities. SECTION III.
    Proposed Methodology Data from the Soil Moisture sensor and the DHT11 sensor are
    both collected by the ESP32 module. While the DHTll sensor monitors the ambient
    temperature and humidity, the soil moisture sensor measures the amount of moisture
    in the soil. The ESP32 module can decide whether to switch the motor on or off
    automatically using the information collected from these sensors. The specific
    rules and thresholds for motor control are determined based on the observed values
    from the sensors. This is explained using Table I. In Table I, the motor running
    condition is denoted by R and not running condition is denoted by NR Table I:
    Conditions for motor activation In the given system, various environmental parameters
    are measured and used to determine the status of temperature, humidity, and soil
    moisture level. Let''s break down the conditions and their corresponding descriptions:
    A. Temperature If the measured temperature is below 32 degrees Celsius, it is
    described as Frigid (F). If the temperature exceeds 42 degrees Celsius, it is
    referred to as Intense (I). If the temperature falls between 32 and 42 degrees
    Celsius, it is considered as pleasant (P). B. Humidity If the measured humidity
    is greater than 75%, it is categorized as greater (GR). If the humidity is between
    40% and 75%, it is considered as average (AVG). If the humidity falls below 40%,
    it is described as lesser (LR). C. Soil Moisture Level If the measured soil moisture
    level exceeds 750, it is labeled as dry (DR). If the soil moisture value is below
    450, it is referred to as wet (WE). If the value lies between 450 and 750, it
    is categorized as Medium (M). These conditions are utilized by an ESP 8266, which
    acts as a microcontroller, to automatically turn on/off a motor based on the combination
    of these parameters. By monitoring the temperature, humidity, and soil moisture
    levels, the Arduino can trigger the motor according to predefined rules and thresholds.
    Here a Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) sensor is utilized to monitor the salt content
    in the water. If the value exceeds 500 ppm, an alert is sent to the farmer through
    an ESP 8266 module. Based on typical specifications for the SW-420, the threshold
    value for impact detection is around 10m/s2• When the vibration or impact exceeds
    this threshold, this indicates the farmer via ESP 8266 module. All the observed
    values are stored in cloud server for further processing. Fig. 2. Block diagram
    Show All SECTION IV. Result and Discussion The experimental setup for the suggested
    method is depicted in figure 3. This is made up of the ESP 8266 and other system-related
    sensors. Fig. 3. Experimental setup Show All Here, the parameters recorded by
    the sensors on the farm are viewed by the farmers using the blynk application.
    In figure 4, this is displayed. Figure 5 provides a comprehensive depiction of
    water consumption patterns across a three-day timeframe, comparing three distinct
    irrigation methods. Our proposed method showcases a relatively efficient utilization
    of water resources, with a modest pumping duration of 7 hours. By contrast, the
    drip irrigation approach demands a more extensive pumping period of 12 hours,
    while the manual irrigation method entails the most protracted water-pumping duration
    of 20 hours and 10 minutes. These findings underscore the potential benefits of
    our IoT-based system, which achieves commendable water conservation while ensuring
    effective irrigation practices. Fig. 4. Blynk application screen shot Show All
    The graph presented in Figure 6 illustrates the accumulated duration of motor
    usage during a three-day period. In the context of IoT-based Smart Irrigation,
    the motor is utilized for only 9.7% of the overall watering time. This percentage
    is notably lower when compared to the motor usage in drip irrigation, which accounts
    for 16.7% of the total watering time, and manual flood irrigation, where the motor
    is employed for 27.8% of the watering duration. Fig. 5. Comparision of water consumption
    patten Show All Fig. 6. Accumulated duration of motor usage during a three-day
    period Show All SECTION V. Conclusion The system incorporates various sensors
    including a soil moisture sensor, DHT11 sensor, vibration sensors, and a TDS sensor.
    These sensors provide valuable data for irrigation control, animal intrusion detection,
    and water quality assessment. Through the integration of the Blynk application,
    the system enables farmers to conveniently access and monitor their fields from
    anywhere, at any time. By utilizing the inputs from the soil moisture sensor and
    DHT11 sensor, the system intelligently activates the irrigation motor based on
    the field''s moisture levels and environmental conditions. The vibration sensors
    serve as effective indicators, promptly alerting farmers about animal intrusions
    and enabling them to take timely preventive measures. Furthermore, the TDS sensor
    plays a crucial role in identifying water salinity, aiding in the maintenance
    of optimal water quality required for crop growth. The implementation of this
    system offers farmers improved control over irrigation, enhanced detection of
    animal intrusions, and better management of water quality. These advancements
    contribute to efficient farming practices, resource optimization, and ultimately,
    higher agricultural yields. Authors Figures References Keywords Metrics More Like

  description: Agricultural production in India is highly vulnerable to climate change.
    Transformational change to farming systems is required to cope with this changing
    climate to maintain food security, and ensure farming to remain economically viable.
    The south Asian rice-fallow systems occupying 22.3 million ha with about 88% in
    India, mostly (82%) concentrated in the eastern states, are under threat. These
    systems currently provide economic and food security for about 11 million people,
    but only achieve 50% of their yield potential. Improvement in productivity is
    possible through efficient utilization of these fallow lands. The relatively low
    production occurs because of sub-optimal water and nutrient management strategies.
    Historically, the Agro-met advisory service has assisted farmers and disseminated
    information at a district-level for all the states. In some instances, Agro-met
    delivers advice at the block level also, but in general, farmers use to follow
    the district level advice and develop an appropriate management plan like land
    preparation, sowing, irrigation timing, harvesting etc. The advisories are generated
    through the District Agrometeorology Unit (DAMU) and Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK)
    network, that consider medium-range weather forecast. Unfortunately, these forecasts
    advisories are general and broad in nature for a given district and do not scale
    down to the individual field or farm. Farmers must make complex crop management
    decisions with limited or generalised information. The lack of fine scale information
    creates uncertainty for farm-ers, who then develop risk-averse management strategies
    that reduce productivity. It is unrealistic to expect the Agro-met advisory service
    to deliver bespoke information to every farmer and to every field simply with
    the help of Kilometre-scale weather forecast. New technologies must be embraced
    to address the emerging crises in food security and economic prosperity. Despite
    these problems, Agro-met has been successful. New digital technologies have emerged
    though, and these digital technologies should become part of the Agro-met arsenal
    to deliver valuable information directly to the farmers at the field scale. The
    Agro-met service is poised to embrace and deliver new interventions through technology
    cross-sections such as satellite remote sensing, drone-based survey, mobile based
    data collection systems, IoT based sensors, using insights derived from a hybridisation
    of crop and AIML (Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning) models. These
    technological advancements will generate fine-scale static and dynamic Agro-met
    information on cultivated lands, that can be delivered through Application Programming
    In-terface (APIs) and farmers facing applications. We believe investment in this
    technology, that delivers information directly to the farmers, can reverse the
    yield gap, and address the negative impacts of a changing climate.

  description: Agriculture plays a most important role in our Indian Economy. As agriculture
    struggles to support the rapidly growing global population, various agricultural
    problems such as plant disease detection/recognition, weed detection, environmental
    prediction, seed quality prediction, seed classification and animal intrusion
    detection are the major threats to crop production and quality of food. Early
    diagnosis and identification of such problems can be helpful for the farmers to
    prevent the loss in crop yield and quantity of crop production. The above mentioned
    agricultural problems which require a monitoring mechanism is one of the recent
    research topics in the agricultural field. The recognition and classification
    of agricultural plant diseases, seed classification, animal/bird intrusion detection,
    pest detection, weed detection by utilizing the deep learning techniques which
    is used to analyze and learn about differential features in a very stratified
    way will minimize risks related to crop protection. IoT based machine learning
    approach for Smart farming is used for environmental impact, agricultural production,
    food security and sustainability. A huge demand for food production must be achieved
    while the population is growing rapidly. Food security will be ensured by sustainable
    farming procedures. Emerging ICT technologies such as IoT, computer vision, cloud
    computing, big data analysis, remote sensing, Robotics, Artificial Intelligence,
    machine learning and deep learning could create new applications to understand
    climatic changes better which would be helpful to increase agricultural productivity
    and food security. IoT gives a new dimension for smart farming and the agricultural
    domain. Thus, IoT based smart farming provides solutions to automate the process
    for irrigation systems, crop monitoring to improve the quality and quantity of
    crops and monitor the agriculture land with the help of IoT sensors. In this chapter,
    IoT based machine learning approach is proposed for rice plant disease detection
    and has achieved an accuracy of about 95% respectively.

    of Bam, Iran Chapter © 2021 4.1 Introduction Nowadays, due to climate change,
    global economic crisis, circumstances at post COVID-19 era efficient construction
    designs following proper health policies and web g.i.s utilities, training e-learning
    ICT''s tools for stakeholders within sustainable tourism infrastructures are becoming
    necessary. Therefore, advancements in information telecommunications technologies
    (ICT''s, IoT''s) are necessary for proper operations project management within
    particular safe green tourism infrastructures [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]. The latter could
    be useful for safe green tourism transportation systems, efficient highway designs
    in supply chain of goods at tourism services, enhancing safe travelling to associated
    cultural facilities, ecological places, archaeological sites, heritage monuments
    and green accurate agricultural facilities [8, 9]. In this way several reclamation
    projects at brownfields and particular agricultural, educational tourism activities
    about the importance of sustainability and green circular economy could be supported
    by clean technologies, proper monitoring environmental health systems, efficient
    green hydraulic designs, effective hybrid waste water unit designs, exploitation
    of robust hydro-geotechnical designs, reclamation projects related to landfill
    emissions for soil health, renewable energy, water resources recovery, safe constructions
    at veterinary units, irrigation systems, transportation facilities, tourism green
    building infrastructures and food safety for public health [8, 10]. There is undoubtedly
    a potential in technology to teach in ways that lead to deeper e-learning experiences,
    and training case studies should be available to them so as to practice them to
    meet the current needs of the market sector based on the curricula of their studies.
    In this way, proper case studies for all ages and levels in vocational education
    training at post-COVID-19 pandemic era should be supported. There is a necessity
    of understanding technology, pedagogy and content knowledge in order to integrate
    technology effectively for the purposes of advancing e-learning related to particular
    efficient construction facilities that promote integrated geo-environmental designs
    for circular economy, supporting particular alternative types of tourism for all
    ages [11,12,13,14,15]. 4.2 Safe Sustainable Tourism Destinations Useful project
    management information management utilities with ICTs and IoTs are necessary,
    including efficient hydraulic designs, associated green construction designs,
    sustainable logistics and safe mobility, road network services information, tourism
    logistics for shipment of goods between stakeholders, sustainable mobility information
    and proper use of renewable goods manufactures. Moreover, in order to achieve
    competitive experiencing, travel destinations are necessary with safe innovative
    construction designs for sports, agrotourism and transport facilities, combined
    with e-learning solutions in the linkage between emerging environmental technologies,
    vocational education, green CE and solutions for tourism in crisis at post-COVID-19
    pandemic era. Findings show that more research is needed to support alternative
    types of tourism related to sustainable constructions that promote agritourism,
    sports and cultural heritage events supporting regional development with green
    tourism CE. In this way, new opportunities for investments at regional level are
    created, generating effective construction design solutions for tourism in crisis
    that support sustainable designs for all, promoting alternative types of tourism
    related to health tourism and creation of new jobs at post-COVID-19 pandemic era,
    taking the right measures for protection of public health. However, innovative
    numerical modeling utilities for project management in environmental and energy
    designs are useful for planners, project managers, engineers, economists, hygienists,
    decision-makers and stakeholders, saving time and money can be achieved in actual
    construction rather than applying any structural procedure for project management
    such as cost scheduling, estimation, planning and control. Further, success or
    failure depends on the balance between quality and timing of the geoinformation
    in associated applications for stakeholders between industrial ecological health,
    sustainability, safety and innovative constructions, environmental energy designs
    available to the engineers and circular economy’s planners, policy makers from
    the database. In this, right way could be achieved for a successful sustainable
    urban city with efficient operations in local level for community healthcare centers;
    interactive activities in sports, infrastructures for medical sports, agricultural
    facilities; health tourism facilities and other related types of tourism associated
    with sustainability and circular economy; clean technologies; renewable resources;
    sustainable transportation; safe mobility; sustainable construction designs and
    landscape management and other associated infrastructures that promote sustainability,
    and new jobs are created for our global community. Developing countries face unique
    challenges with the construction, energy design, efficient water resources use,
    associated designs in circular economy within environmental clean technologies
    and operations of new infrastructures protecting infrastructures that promote
    sustainability, public health, environmental impact assessments and adverse health
    effects. Nations with mature infrastructure have followed traditional technology
    models for design, planning, construction and operation of facilities. An integrated
    environmental health policy is demanded for the sustainable development of our
    society. Community health centers and infrastructures associated with public health
    protection should follow the right strategic aims, guidelines, principles based
    on the next flowchart. In Fig. 4.1 is presented a roadmap for safe travel destinations
    promoting sustainable tourism within an integrated eco-health policy within circular
    economy, supporting innovative civil environmental engineering solutions and associated
    energy designs for public health protection and sustainable development. Fig.
    4.1 Roadmap for safe travel destinations and promotion of sustainable tourism
    at post-COVID-19 era Full size image Environmental management is a discipline
    concerned with the resources required by society. In an attempt to address growing
    environmental awareness, most industrial companies include investments in their
    plans that are directed toward the protection of the environment. It is necessary
    to manage environmental resources applying proper roadmap for sustainable designs
    in a way that promotes green circular economy so as to mitigate associated risks
    in tourism sector due to particular environmental impacts like climate change,
    environmental pollution, energy crisis, accidental facility attacks, global economic
    crisis, war conditions, pandemic circumstances in post COVID-19 era. Problems
    with the quality of a complicated environmental system arise when it is required
    to cover both its needs and the environmental effects of such a system, and this
    can become an environmental public health risk. Therefore, an improvement in the
    economic budget and monitoring of and proper project management of technical projects
    within environmental systems are necessary. Based on Fig. 4.1, efficient environmentally
    sustainable energy designs are necessary with right geoinformation utilities,
    risk assessment (RA) tools, sanitary drawings, monitoring schemes, life cycle
    analysis (LCA), quality assurance, econometrics, ICT’s utilities for circular
    economy in smart cities and proper geoinformatics tools for environmental ecosystem
    health for the update of industrial ecological health data and sustainable development
    in a circular economy. An integrated environmental ecological health policy should
    be focused on associated eco-health problems, providing solutions and right health
    studies to particular demographic and spatial datasets of our society. As the
    population increases, right designs are necessary for the sustainable progress
    of smart cities in a circular economy with our global society. Useful e-learning
    tools like ICTs are necessary, focused on safe measures at post-COVID-19 era for
    vocational education, creation of new jobs for all including refugees, gender
    equal opportunities and promotion of green tourism supporting effective community
    health tourism infrastructures with sport events and agritourism activities, protecting
    public health [3,4,5,6, 12,13,14, 16,17,18,19,20,21]. One important issue is the
    investment in sustainable designs supporting innovations in environmental technologies
    for public health protection and the sustainability of our society and its resources.
    Effective waste management schemes, landfill designs, waste water treatment designed
    units and emerging environmental technologies should be supported as a result
    of robust sustainable effective designs for public health protection and sustainability.
    Landfill emissions like biogas and treated leachates should be exploited properly
    so as to be used as goods for the society, promoting a sustainable development
    for new jobs in our society, supporting clean technologies, renewable resources
    for safe food productivity, sustainable mobility and public health protection
    [1, 6, 7, 11,12,13,14,15, 22,23,24]. 4.3 Solutions for Tourism in Crisis at Post-COVID-19
    Era An integrated environmental health policy is demanded for the sustainable
    development of our society. Community health centers and infrastructures associated
    with public health protection should follow the right strategic aims, guidelines,
    principles based on the next flowchart. In Fig. 4.1 is presented a useful flow
    chart for an integrated eco-health policy that supports green circular economy,
    innovative sustainable design solutions, safe green tourism infrastructures and
    associated energy designs for safe green travel destinations within public health
    protection and sustainable development. Nowadays, innovative energy systems, efficient
    construction management, monitoring schemes, supply chain project management and
    sustainable designs are necessary not only for the environmental protection of
    our planet but also for the sustainable development in smart cities and circular
    economy. Waste management is the discipline that is concerned with resources once
    society no longer requires them. It is necessary to manage the waste in a sustainable
    way by minimizing the environmental impacts related to waste. Solid waste disposal
    starts to be a problem when the amount and the environmental impacts of such disposal
    arise and become an environmental public health hazard. Then, the improvement
    of the management solid waste systems on a monitoring and spatial diagnosis base
    is necessary [2, 7, 14, 15]. The application of engineering mathematics in numerical
    models and their results in landfill emissions can be used for the determination
    of areas that are under risk for landfill gas emissions and leachates so as to
    take the right measures for safe community health tourism infrastructures and
    sustainable sports tourism facilities [11, 12, 14, 15, 18, 23]. Although the operation
    of efficient ecological environmental health projects and energy control systems
    is semantic, the environmental awareness campaigns should be organized to the
    public information for safe tourism infrastructures. Therefore, in such cases,
    there will be a public support to the installation of any necessary monitoring
    systems, associated sustainable designs, safe infrastructures for sustainable
    smart tourism destinations, efficient community health centers and effective eco-friendly
    sustainable designs for agritourism and sports activities [12,13,14,15]. Useful
    models in particular hydro-geotechnical green irrigation-drainage projects as
    well as in green tourism transportation energy solutions, green logistics transportation
    systems, clean technologies, green tourism buildings, are necessary for integrated
    sustainable development designs at associated alternative types of tourism and
    public health protection at post COVID-19 era [2, 12,13,14, 23]. Monitoring programs,
    efficient designs, emerging environmental technologies for health protection,
    right project management and field data are of great importance so as to set up
    utilities, taking into account useful numerical models based on case studies like
    the MACH one and its landfill gas and leachate emissions and others for soil oxidation.
    Right measures, activities should be taken into account based on environmental
    impact assessments, risk assessments for safe travel destinations, sports tourism
    facilities and agritourism infrastructures for sustainable community health tourism
    [11,12,13,14,15, 23]. Based on the above could be created particular new services—jobs
    for stakeholders, supported by proper e-learning, training web utilities for refugees,
    unemployed people related to sustainable health ecological tourism sector and
    associated alternative types of tourism so as to create new investments and jobs
    for tourism in global economic crisis. It is more important to determine expectations
    for professional improvement for graduates and stakeholders at all educational
    levels than it is to determine expectations for personal enrichment [1,2,3,4,
    6]. While the distance education environment is changing due to emerging ICT’s
    and IoT’s, Web utilities should be presented proper case studies to graduates
    and stakeholders so as to be useful not only at vocational education level or
    at their particular health and safety learning ones but also for their professional
    career level, meeting the demands of the market related to emerging environmental
    technologies within sustainable tourism opportunities for stakeholders and investors.
    Training tools using proper ICT’s and IoT’s could be applied as teacher that plays
    the most important role in the teaching process for students, graduates and stakeholders
    [4,5,6,7, 22, 25]. Proper technology should support trainers and teachers without
    replacing them. Students, graduates and stakeholders need trainers and teachers
    who act as guides, mentors, counselors and providing useful educational materials
    to students, supporting the relative operations management. One of the major goals
    of this study is to develop the presented planning guidelines and capacity guidelines
    that support an integrated safe cultural tourism in relation to ecological health
    sports tourism and particular economic instruments that create good experiences
    to tourists within safe infrastructures related to particular ecological sport
    tourism supply facilities, dance festival events as well as mountain trekking,
    sea sport events or river ones. Many opportunities exist for further research
    for creation of new jobs for women at cultural tourism. The link between cultural
    tourism, sport and ecological tourism in regional tourist Mediterranean countries
    is growing stronger, which could be reflected in tourist product design. This
    provides particular added values for stakeholders and investors for an integrated
    sustainable tourism development. Moreover, based on the above presented analysis,
    it is necessary to promote useful e-learning, ICTs training tools, Web project
    management utilities for vocational students, graduates and stakeholders within
    associated sectors related to safe travel destinations, taking the right measures
    for public health protection within tourism industry, construction industry, safe
    associated mobility infrastructures, sustainable port designs on islands and assistance
    at particular community health centers at emergencies in post-COVID-19 era. New
    opportunities are coming up for immigrants creating new jobs at several alternative
    types of tourism, and new opportunities for stakeholders and investors will exist.
    A proper planning is necessary for regional tourism development for how best to
    develop and market relative regional tourism travel at ecological attractions,
    at fabulous mountainous landscapes next to coast lines applying several activities
    of alternative types of tourism like Greek islands and other picturesque places
    at Mediterranean places. The results of this study will help to identify and overcome
    the key obstacles to the development of an integrated regional heritage, cultural
    tourism creating added values to associated alternative types of tourism, promoting
    local agricultural tourism food products, drinks and souvenirs. Integrated construction
    facilities should be encouraged in terms of empowerment of ecological health tourism,
    promote local monuments, religion tourism, battlefield tourism other alternative
    types of tourism and sports events or festivals between Mediterranean countries
    supporting cultural, heritage, environmental and public health protection at post-COVID-19
    era. 4.4 Eco-Health Policy for Air Pollutants Minimization from Transportation
    Infrastructures Geoinformatics tools are necessary for a qualitative eco-health
    policy of project management in road designs, associated hydraulic projects and
    utilities in transportation systems at ecosystems for the efficient sustainable
    designs in particular tourism infrastructures that are related to environmental
    eco-health quality, maintenance, right decision-making, policy-making and promotion
    of sustainability in efficient environmental technologies and facilities. Innovate
    hydraulic technologies should be supported where it is fissile so as to promote
    clean technologies for safe community health tourism infrastructures, sports tourism
    facilities at post-COVID-19 era. The outcomes of an efficient ecological and economical
    sustainable health tourism policy that supports clean emerging environmental technologies
    for healthcare protection within sports events and agritourism activities and
    hybrid smart renewable energy resources are useful for policy-makers, decision-makers,
    politicians, safety engineers, health inspectors, project managers and quality
    managers for monitoring, ISO managers and other stakeholders in quality assurance
    and operational environmental management process control of landfill emissions
    so as to protect public health from particular hazardous emissions. In this way,
    are determined the right capacities and the successful operational design of an
    integrated environmental management in sustainable smart cities facilities applying
    the right geoinformation, ICTs, IoTs, e-learning tools and drawings utilities
    for the good operation of circular economies supporting sustainability in tourism
    sector that is under crisis at post-COVID-19 era. Sanitary technologies protecting
    public health in urban community healthcare with efficient mobility in associated
    constructions for transportation infrastructures are necessary taking into account
    that they will operate properly also in emergencies [2, 11,12,13,14, 16,17,18,19,20,21,
    26]. Dynamic spatial models are necessary not only to evaluate associated risks
    and particular environmental indexes but also to demonstrate efficient sustainable
    designs that minimize any environmental impacts to receptors. Based on Fig. 4.2
    is presented an investigated framework for environmental and public health protection
    policy of a sustainable city within integrated waste management facilities and
    environmental management stakeholders applying properly environmental engineering
    tools to support agritourism events and sport events, minimizing operational costs
    at particular hotel infrastructures. Fig. 4.2 Framework for environmental and
    public health protection policy of a sustainable city for safe travel destinations
    within agritourism events and sport events supporting unique travel destinations
    at post-COVID-19 era Full size image 4.5 Conclusions Useful geoinformation ICT’s
    tools could be used in transportation infrastructures in smart logistics for safe
    and optimum supply chain project management of goods and protection of air quality,
    water quality and soil quality within associated ecological health facilities.
    The latter activities could include community healthcare centers at medical healthcare
    infrastructures or ecological tourism ones linked with other alternative types
    of tourism like agricultural tourism, sea tourism and medical sports. Useful construction
    designs and recycled materials should be developed for the above business opportunities
    in an integrated circular economy. Moreover, smart ICT’s in project management
    and quality assurance of sustainable projects should exist in eco-health infrastructures
    like clean energy and emerging environmental technologies for qualitative and
    safe travel destinations within community health tourism events for tourists protecting
    public health and community healthcare ecosystems from environmental pollution

    The majority of countries rely largely on agriculture for employment. Irrigation
    accounts for a sizable amount of water use. Crop irrigation is an important step
    in crop yield prediction. Field harvesting is very reliant on human supervision
    and experience. It is critical to safeguard the field’s water supply. The shortage
    of fresh water is a major challenge for the world, and the situation will deteriorate
    further in the next years. As a result of the aforementioned challenges, smart
    irrigation and precision farming are the only viable solutions. Only with the
    emergence of the Internet of Things and machine learning have smart irrigation
    and precision agriculture become economically viable. Increased efficiency, expense
    optimization, energy maximization, forecasting, and general public convenience
    are all benefits of the Internet of Things (IoT). As systems and data processing
    become more diversified, security issues arise. Security and privacy concerns
    are impeding the growth of the Internet of Things. This article establishes a
    framework for detecting and classifying intrusions into IoT networks used in agriculture.
    Security and privacy are major concerns not only in agriculture-related IoT networks
    but in all applications of the Internet of Things as well. In this framework,
    the NSL KDD data set is used as an input data set. In the preprocessing of the
    NSL-KDD data set, first all symbolic features are converted to numeric features.
    Feature extraction is performed using principal component analysis. Then, machine
    learning algorithms such as support vector machine, linear regression, and random
    forest are used to classify preprocessed data set. Performance comparisons of
    machine learning algorithms are evaluated on the basis of accuracy, precision,
    and recall parameters. 1. Introduction Agriculture is very important to the country’s
    economic well-being because it provides food for everyone. One of the most important
    things that happened in the country is linked to it. If a country has a lot of
    farmers, it is thought to be both economically and socially wealthy. Agriculture
    is the main source of jobs in most countries. When there are a lot of people on
    a big farm, they often need help with planting and caring for the animals. These
    large farms can use nearby processing facilities to finish and improve their agricultural
    goods [ 1]. As human civilization has progressed, there have been big changes
    in agricultural output. These changes have made it possible to use less resources
    and carry out less work. Despite this, demand and supply have never been able
    to meet due to the high population density. In 2050, the world’s population is
    expected to grow to 9.8 billion people, a 25 percent increase over the current
    amount [ 1]. There is a strong likelihood that the majority of population growth
    will occur in developing countries [ 2]. Despite this, 70 percent of the world’s
    population is anticipated to live in cities by 2050, up from 49 percent now [
    3]. In addition, as incomes rise, so will the need for food, particularly in developing
    countries. As a result, these countries will become more aware of the quality
    of their food and diet. As a result, consumers’ tastes may move away from grains
    and cereals toward legumes and, eventually, meat. In agriculture, water is a valuable
    yet finite natural resource [ 4– 6]. In a country like India, a considerable amount
    of water is used for irrigation [ 7]. Many environmental conditions influence
    crop productivity, including air temperature, soil temperature, and humidity [
    8]. Crop irrigation is an important component in affecting crop output [ 8]. Farmers
    rely substantially on human supervision and experience for harvesting fields [
    9]. The water supply for the field must be preserved [ 10]. In today’s globe,
    water scarcity is a big issue. It is already a problem for people all across the
    world [ 11, 12]. The scenario could get even worse in the coming years. Smart
    farming is a term that refers to a well-known and better way to run a farm that
    has become more common in modern farming. Agricultural and information technologies
    are used to keep an eye on the health and production of crops. This includes keeping
    an eye on field crop conditions and other indicators [ 13, 14]. Finally, the goal
    of smart farming is to cut the cost of agricultural inputs while still keeping
    the quality of the end product the same. If you use a lot of pesticide or fertilizer
    at the same time, the whole field is treated as a single unit. The principal sources
    of natural water resources are rainwater, subterranean water, and surface water.
    96.5 percent of the world’s water is found in the oceans. Only 0.001 percent of
    the remaining water on the globe can be found in clouds, mist, and precipitation,
    which is 1.7 percent of the world’s total water supply. The majority of the world’s
    surface water is found in the ocean, which is made up of salt water. Therefore,
    there is a shortage of fresh water in most of the countries around the world.
    The survival of all ecosystems depends on the availability of fresh water. According
    to the World Resources Institute (WRI), most of the countries are expected to
    face water scarcity in upcoming years [ 15]. There is a considerable impact on
    downstream ecosystems due to the vast majority of freshwater being used for agricultural
    and industrial uses. There is a need to utilize fresh water in such a way that
    the upcoming generations do not get affected by the scarcity of fresh water. The
    soil contains a variety of soil types, including sandy, salty, and clayey soils.
    Each type of soil has its own advantages and disadvantages. A good example of
    this is sandy soil, which has a high capacity for drainage. Drainage, on the other
    hand, swiftly removes nutrients from the soil. The soil’s properties are crucial
    to determining how much water a plant needs [ 16]. Agricultural jobs, in particular,
    can benefit greatly from data mining approaches. One of these operations is the
    use of association rule restrictions to regulate water use in agricultural areas.
    In addition, the Internet of Things has made smart farming possible by various
    data acquisition and storage techniques. Field values for optimal plant irrigation
    are collected by smart sensor networks in modern irrigation systems. Machine learning
    is used in a wide range of real-world applications such as smart farming, smart
    healthcare, smart logistics, and smart production. In the framework [ 17], data
    are acquired using soil and moisture sensors, and then they are stored on a centralized
    cloud server. On a cloud server, various analytics are performed using machine
    learning algorithms. This framework provides the exact water quantity required
    for a particular crop. This framework is shown in Figure 1.    Figure 1  A framework
    for smart irrigation. An IoT-enabled global smart city concept is possible. There
    are many different types of intelligent communities, such as smart homes, smart
    farms, smart environments, smart fitness, and smart governance, for example. Additionally,
    the Internet of Things is employed in the oil and gas extraction, manufacturing,
    and refining industries. The Internet of Things (IoT) improves efficiency, optimizes
    costs, maximizes energy utilization, maintains forecasts, and provides a great
    deal of convenience for the general public. Security concerns are increasing as
    more and more systems and data processing become more diversified. Security and
    privacy concerns are the primary impediments to the growth of the Internet of
    Things. Computer security is the act of securing computer systems from external
    threats in order to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of
    computing resources. When an intrusion occurs, the network resources and the victim
    server are put in danger [ 18]. System administrators can take action if intrusions
    are detected by the intrusion detection system (IDS) because it monitors and reports
    on intrusions. As the number of cyberattacks has risen, so has people’s mistrust
    of the Internet. A denial of service (DoS) is a well-executed security attack
    (DoS). It is possible to use IDS to detect attacks from the outside as well as
    from within a company’s computer network. It looks like a burglar alarm, but an
    intrusion detection system is different. It is proposed in this article a framework
    for detecting and categorizing intrusions into Internet of Things networks that
    are utilized in agriculture. Security and privacy are important considerations
    not only in IoT networks linked to agriculture but also in all Internet of Things
    applications in general. As an input data set, the NSL KDD data set is used in
    this technique and is available online [ 19]. The NSL-KDD data collection is preprocessed
    by first translating all symbolic features to numeric features and then transforming
    all numeric features to symbolic features. In order to extract features, principal
    component analysis is utilized. After that, the preprocessed data set is categorized
    using machine learning methods such as support vector machine, linear regression,
    and random forest to determine its classification. When comparing the performance
    of machine learning algorithms, the accuracy, precision, and recall measurements
    are taken into consideration. 2. Literature Survey 2.1. Review of Existing Irrigation
    Systems A wide range of industries, including the military and agriculture, rely
    on wireless sensor networks (WSNs). A lot of research is going on the power consumption
    of wireless sensor network. Metaheuristics and WSN life spans were also examined
    in their research. Using metaheuristic algorithms, they propose a transition,
    evaluation, and determination procedure that helps to find the optimal solution
    to the problem. It is clear from their explanation that the metaheuristic method
    requires a thorough comprehension of the many field characteristics and domain
    expertise associated with the longevity problem. Metaheuristic algorithms have
    already been studied by a large number of academics. Even though these strategies
    increase the WSN’s effectiveness, there are still a number of issues that need
    to be addressed. Contingency planning may lead to a reduction of sensors or cluster
    heads. Furthermore, metaheuristic approaches are meant for optimization and are
    not suitable to solve scalable problems. According to Li et al. [ 20], the nodes
    should be as small as possible to enhance connection and coverage. The proposed
    method is compared to other existing methods to perform the similar task. The
    efficacy of the suggested strategy was proven in four unique instances using two
    well-known ways. WSN nodes are used in mobile network topologies when a significant
    level of communication frequency is required. Hassan and colleagues explored the
    use of frequencies for industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) objectives [
    21]. The premise of their reasoning is frequency reuse at sensor nodes along busy
    pathways. In order to spread the load across the macro cells, we employed the
    CR approach. In turn, this results in a reduced crash area and greater space for
    passengers in their suggested design. Using an underground sensor network, soil
    humidity and temperature may be monitored in real time. Thus, sensors and power
    adjustments for input setup and regular energy maintenance are appropriately installed
    and maintained [ 22]. Verma et al. [ 23] investigated the use of wireless sensors
    for irrigation scheduling. Using a sensor array and sensor network-based accuracy
    technologies, they are able to predict real-time watering demands in the soil
    and so save unnecessary watering. For irrigation systems to function more efficiently,
    data transmission demands improved energy savings. Multiple access time division
    (MATD) is claimed by Ushakov et al. [ 24] to be more efficient for data transfer
    in WSN irrigation systems (TDMA). Energy is saved by immediate transmission and
    the addition of data. TDMA also enhances the performance of the network. Goumopoulos
    et al. [ 25] developed an ontological technique for a wireless sensor or actuator-based
    autonomous zone irrigation system. In precision agriculture, plants communicate
    with one other in order to preserve water. Detecting node problems in the network
    is the primary goal of this system, which employs many machine learning approaches.
    In the past, irrigation activities were made more automated and user-friendly
    by creating end-user apps. Cotton crops can be irrigated more efficiently according
    to a system devised by Rakhra et al. [ 26]. Researchers have used a wide range
    of data sets to predict the exact amount of water decided for a particular combination
    of soil. The output of the analytical study is made available to the farmers or
    other users by a mobile application. Lopez et al. [ 27] investigated the agricultural
    uses of wireless sensor networks. Time-dependent agriculture industry characteristics
    were discussed extensively in their debate. As a consequence, they compiled a
    list of sensors that may be used to monitor agricultural factors. In the end,
    they looked at a variety of communication networks and made comparisons. According
    to [ 28, 29],field productivity can be improved by sending out notifications in
    the form of text messages or emails when certain variables have been measured
    over a threshold. Some sensors, such as those used to assess agricultural fields’
    statistical features, were thoroughly examined, as were the products they are
    linked to and the specifications attached to them. The model had sensors for soil
    water content, soil moisture content, soil electrical conductivity, pH, temperature,
    and wind speed. Dou et al. [ 30] designed an ecofriendly framework to implement
    the basic functions of smart agriculture including the optimization of farming
    resources, decision support, and land surveillance. Water and fertilizer consumption
    may be maximized while crop yields can be improved at the same time thanks to
    a new technique they have devised. Deepika and Rajapirian [ 31] have created a
    wireless sensor network prototype for precision agriculture that makes use of
    a constrained power source. For their model, they employed sand soil with varying
    amounts of water in order to demonstrate the impacts of off-the-shelf technology.
    According to Deepika and Rajapirian [ 32], a research study on the current status
    of precision agriculture’s wireless sensor networks assessed some of the more
    cutting-edge possibilities. In order to monitor a plant, an FPGA-based control
    system is employed. Imam et al. [ 33] examined various issues and challenges related
    to wireless sensor networks and sensors for IoT-based agriculture in order to
    optimize farmer advantages. In precision agriculture, microcontroller families
    and sensor nodes were compared. Researchers also detailed the demands of relative
    humidity sensors and their interfaces. 2.2. Review of Existing Intrusion Detection
    Methods Computational intelligence is a new generation of information systems
    that are being built with the help of soft computing [ 34]. With a soft computing
    system, you can build intelligent machines that can solve complicated real-world
    issues that cannot be mathematically modeled because they are too hard to model.
    In order to attain a likeness to human decision-making, it uses tolerance for
    approximation, ambiguity, imprecision, and partial reality [ 35]. Soft computing
    methods for intrusion detection are summarized in this section. The research is
    broken into four sections: fuzzy logic, neural networks, evolutionary algorithms,
    and artificial immune systems. Intrusion detection has yet to benefit from the
    use of coupled map lattices. Since its inception in Holland, the genetic algorithm
    (GA) has been shown to be a flexible and effective search engine. Evolution in
    the wild is simulated using computer technology. As a stochastic global search
    process, the GA is based on the survival of the fittest principle and creates
    ever-closer approximations to a solution. New solutions are generated every generation
    by selecting people based on their performance in the issue area and spawning
    children. Individuals that are better suited to the problem area than their predecessors
    can be formed by using this method of recruiting new employees [ 36]. The fitness
    function provides an indication of how people did in the issue area. As a result
    of the flocking and schooling behavior of birds and fish [ 37], they created PSO
    in 1995 [ 38]. Artificial life, psychology, physics, and computer science all
    played a role in the development of PSO in some capacity. A “population” of particles
    moves around the problem region at specific rates in order to solve it. Particle
    velocities are adjusted via stochastic calibration based on their prior best position
    and their best nearby position. Both the particle best and the neighborhood best
    are calculated using a user-defined fitness function. As each particle moves,
    it naturally results in a near-ideal solution or a near-optimum solution. “Swarm”
    is used to describe the movement of particles in the issue room, rather than a
    flock of birds or school of fish. As an approximation logic known as fuzzy logic
    (FL), two-valued logic is expanded to include operations on fuzzy sets, such as
    equalization, enclosure, complementation, intersection, and union, in the context
    of fuzzy logic. Machine learning optimization and classification paradigms based
    on evolutionary processes like genetics and natural selection are used in evolutionary
    computing. In the field of evolutionary computing, concepts such as genetic algorithms,
    evolutionary programming, genetic programming, and evolution techniques are all
    included. Genetic algorithms are the most frequently used in applications [ 39].
    The hidden naive Bayes classifier (HNB) is more adaptable than the classic naive
    Bayesian classifier. In the HNB model, the hidden parent of each attribute is
    specified by adding a new layer. The structural properties of HNB can be inferred
    using naive Bayes. Hidden parents are created for each trait so that the forces
    of its other characteristics can be brought together. The average of weighted
    one-dependence estimators [ 40] is used to describe hidden parents. The support
    vector machine (SVM) is a classification method based on statistical learning
    theory (SLT). Hyperplane classifiers are another example of this. Using SVM, an
    ideal hyperplane maximizes the difference between two groups while minimizing
    any overlap. There are several layers of latent variables (hidden units) in DBNs
    in machine learning, and the relations between the levels but not the units inside
    each layer are generative graph models or deep neural networks. A model created
    by researchers in [ 42] can be used to select the features of an intrusion detection
    system. Using genetic algorithms and PSO, the data set has an accuracy percentage
    of 91.75%. 3. Methodology Figure 2 presents a framework for intrusion detection
    and classification system for IoT network for agriculture fields. The main components
    of this framework are IDS data set, data preprocessing algorithm, machine learning
    algorithms, and prediction module.    Figure 2  A framework for IDS for IoT networks
    for agriculture fields. In preprocessing of the NSL-KDD data set, firstly all
    symbolic features are converted to numeric features. The target class is also
    allocated unique numbers. Continuous numeric features such as duration (duration
    of connection) and SRC bytes (data bytes) present in the dataset are normalized
    using z-score normalization. Feature extraction is carried out using the principle
    component analysis (PCA) approach in this article. Data analysis and compression
    may benefit from PCA’s linear approach to dimensionality reduction [ 30]. It is
    based on finding orthogonal linear combinations of the original characteristics
    with the greatest variance in order to convert a large number of uncorrelated
    features. 3.1. Support Vector Machine Approach When it comes to handling two-class
    categorization problems, a support vector machine (SVM) is the most common method.
    It is possible to perform classification and regression with SVM in addition to
    other uses. In addition, SVM uses the kernel phenomenon to alter the data before
    determining an appropriate boundary between the most likely outcomes. In addition,
    the decision line between the two classes on a graph must be wide enough to be
    discernible. SVM creates an ideal boundary that divides the new data point into
    the correct categories. For that reason, the hyperplane is often referred to as
    the ideal boundary. 3.2. Logistic Regression Logistic regression is the technique
    used to link a dependent variable to one or more independent variables. In some
    contexts, the dependent variable and the independent variable are referred to
    as predictors and predictors, respectively. Temperature and humidity differential,
    soil moisture, and pH rate are variables independent of plant type prediction
    (c). The following formula has been established: 3.3. Random Forest All of the
    predictors in a random forest are built from random variables with the same distribution
    across all the trees in the forest. The forest’s generalization error decreases
    as time passes. In the woods, there is a record number of trees. The generalization
    error of a tree classifier forest depends on the relative strength of the individual
    forest trees and their comparison. As compared to AdaBoost, using a random selection
    of features to split each node results in error rates that are more stable. Variance,
    frequency, and consistency of internal measurements are used to indicate the reaction
    to an increase in the number of attributes that are split. The parameter importance
    estimate is also based on external measurements. Regression is based on the same
    principles. 4. Results and Analysis In fact, the NSLKDD dataset is used for anomaly
    detection. This enhanced version of the KDDCUP99 dataset has no redundancy, no
    duplication of records, and a lower complexity level than NSLKDD [ 43]. Twenty
    percent of the NSLKDD dataset is training data (25192 records), and the remaining
    eighty percent is testing data (100781 records). In this paper, we use only 20%
    of the training data to generate decision rules. In the experimental analysis,
    three classification algorithms, namely, SVM-support vector machine, logistic
    regression, and random forest classifiers, are used. To calculate accuracy the
    following formulae were used: where TP represents true positive, TN represents
    true negative, FP represents false positive, and FN represents false negative.
    The results proved that the accuracy of the SVM classifier is better than that
    of the random forest and logic regression algorithms. It is shown in Table 1 and
    Figure 3. Also, Figure 4 shows a graphical representation of the accuracy results
    of machine learning algorithms. Table 1  Accuracy of machine learning algorithms.    Figure
    3  Accuracy of classifiers.    Figure 4  Graphical representation of the accuracy
    results of machine learning algorithms. Precision and recall parameters are also
    used to measure the performance of machine learning algorithms. Precision and
    recall of SVM, random forest, and logistic regression for intrusion detection
    of agriculture fields are shown below in Figures 5 and 6.    Figure 5  Precision
    of classifiers for intrusion classification for agriculture fields.    Figure
    6  Recall of classifiers for intrusion classification for agriculture fields.
    In this graph, SVM exceeds random forest and logistic regression in terms of machine
    learning algorithm accuracy. The accuracy of SVM is higher than 98%, but random
    forest and logistic regression accuracy is less than 78%. 5. Conclusion Agriculture
    is crucial to the country’s economic well-being since farmers produce food for
    everyone. It connects a varied spectrum of enterprises around the country. A country
    with a sizable agricultural sector is considered wealthy economically and socially.
    Agriculture is critical in the majority of countries as a source of employment.
    Irrigation accounts for a sizable portion of overall water use in a country like
    India. Among the several elements affecting crop productivity are the surrounding
    environment’s temperature, soil temperature, and relative humidity. Agricultural
    irrigation is crucial in crop production since it has a direct effect on crop
    yield. Harvesting fields successfully is highly dependent on human supervision
    and experience. It is vital to safeguard the field’s water supply at all costs.
    Water scarcity is a significant issue in contemporary civilization. The issue
    is global in scope, affecting individuals on a daily basis. As a result, we are
    concerned about the possibility of the situation deteriorating worse in the next
    few years. To address the issues highlighted above, smart irrigation and precision
    farming are the answer. Smart irrigation and precision agriculture are only possible
    with the development of the Internet of things and machine learning. Numerous
    benefits accrue from the Internet of Things, including enhanced efficiency, cost
    optimization, optimal energy consumption, forecasting, and convenience for the
    general public (IoT). The diversity of data processing technologies and methodologies
    raises issues regarding their dependability and security. Concerns about security
    and privacy are impeding mainstream adoption of the Internet of Things. This article
    proposes a system for detecting and categorizing intrusions into IoT networks
    in agricultural regions. SVM has a precision of greater than 98 per cent; however,
    random forest and logistic regression have a precision of less than 78 percent.

    IEEE Conference Location: Pitesti, Romania SECTION I. Introduction Monitoring
    of water quality is an important stage when ensuring water safety and is based
    on both European Union and national legislation. Currently, more than 90% of the
    population worldwide consumes controlled water [1]. The routine monitoring system,
    which only tests a small fraction of all distributed water, can only give the
    minimum standards for quality monitoring. The monitoring results show that contaminants
    are present, and a threat is already present in the water, endangering consumers’
    safety [2]. Contamination can result in an outbreak of water in the worst-case
    scenario. The purpose of the SWAM (Smart WAter Management system for better environmental
    sustainability) project is to enable water quality monitoring and use in domains
    such as smart agriculture. Current water quality monitoring stations have disadvantages
    that limit the control of their use in the supply networks: unsustainable energy
    consumption, fragility, manual calibration, lack of precision, needs and high
    maintenance costs [3]. The SWAM alternative addresses the key challenges for the
    water sector, namely: the economy of providing low-cost sensor arrays, implementation
    in remote locations, adequate data acquisition/management and scalability. An
    approach to risk management could be the prevention of contamination and preplanning
    of countermeasures should contamination occur [2]. An extensive management protocol
    and risk assessment concerning the whole water production systems, from raw water
    sources to consumer’s taps, might be an answer to “complete” safe water monitoring.
    An option to achieve a comprehensive risk assessment and risk management system
    for a safe water system in agriculture is to apply Water Safety Planning (WSP)
    protocol. Water safety plans are used for risk management at the time of the distribution
    and treatment, ensuring that monitoring is not the primary method used for water
    quality management and further minimizing the risk of contamination. A set of
    instruments exists for establishing and operating a water safety plan for irrigation-water
    in agriculture, which will be discussed later in this paper. It is demonstrated
    how an event, such as raw water contamination is recognized, how risks are assessed,
    then a decision-making process and management action is taken, resulting in a
    new enhanced change in water quality. Further, beside the current section, the
    paper comprises other four sections. Section 2 explores the state of the art of
    blockchain technology. Section 3 investigates the cybersecurity risks in the water
    sector. Section 4 discusses the technologies used in the project. Section 5 brings
    conclusions and explains future work. SECTION II. Related Work IoT devices are
    being used in as many areas as possible. Because of this, the topic is treated
    by as many researchers as possible who test their applicability in as many projects
    as possible. With this advantage brought by the IoT technology, the problems caused
    by the cyber attackers who try to steal the data sent through these devices have
    started to appear. As can be seen in the article [4], the authors analyze the
    applicability of IoT devices in smart homes, smart cities, Smart Healthcare, Smart
    Environment and Agriculture and Energy Conservation. All this has been analyzed
    from the point of view of both cyber and physical security. Depending on the application
    in which these IoT devices are used, the threats may be different. Researchers
    have found blockchain as a common solution for secure data storage. With the help
    of this technology used mainly in the field of cryptocurrencies or banking transactions,
    they were able to ensure a much higher level of security for the data received
    from the sensors [5]. A brief definition of blockchain can be the storage of digital
    information in a public database in the form of blocks. The link between the network
    blocks is made with the help of cryptography, each block having a hash that connects
    it with the preceding block, a transaction and timestamp information. The link
    to the previous block (hash) can be compared to a digital fingerprint, representing
    a unique key that can identify the block and its contents. Due to the appearance
    of high-performance and fast computers, hashes are not enough to prevent manipulation;
    thus, to avoid this problem, one solution would be to have a proof-of-work system
    that slows down the creation of a block. Therefore, this technology has the main
    advantage that the data stored once in the blocks can no longer be modified. These
    blockchain networks are mainly used for: address derivation, data security, and
    block header security [6]. One of the most important resources is represented
    by water, having many roles in obtaining food, electricity, sewerage but also
    for the proper functioning of the ecosystem, human health and socio-economic progress.
    Thus, the study of water quality is necessary to obtain all these benefits. This
    can be seen in the paper [7], which analyses a wide range of sensors that can
    be used in the study of water quality, such as: pH sensors, dissolved oxygen sensors
    or micronutrient sensors. The security of this data will be done with the help
    of a blockchain network that will use several Big Data located in different locations.
    The advantage comes from the fact that in these databases, whole data packets
    will not be stored, but they will be distributed in several databases [8]. Blockchain
    technology is widespread and applied in many fields, such as healthcare, logistics,
    transportation and energy systems [9–12]. Regarding water systems, several articles
    and initiatives discuss the use of the blockchain in water systems, namely: water
    resources management, water quality, wastewater management and use. Blockchain-based
    water asset trading systems aim to promote water consumption and create a market
    for water asset trading between consumers. This approach leads to: encouraging
    the use of alternative water resources channels for its collection (e.g., improved
    shallow groundwater resources systems and rainwater collection systems), reducing
    water leakage and minimizing operating costs [13–14]. SECTION III. Cybersecurity
    Risks In the Water Sector The Romanian national cybersecurity strategy describes
    the following priorities: Creating compulsory educational programmes at different
    levels of the educational cycle on the safe use of computing and internet equipment.
    Developing a security system by raising awareness about the risks, threats and
    vulnerabilities originating from cyberspace and the need to safeguard the information
    systems. Providing professional training to employers that work in cybersecurity
    with the widespread promotion of professional certifications. Participating in
    the initiatives of international organizations to establish and define a set of
    cyberspace confidence-building measures. Developing and supporting national and
    worldwide collaboration in the domain of cybersecurity between the private and
    public sectors. A cyberattack on critical water sector activities might damage
    public health and safety, threaten national security, and conclude in costly repair
    and recovery efforts to solve system issues and data loss. Attacks that cause
    operational failure, contamination, or service outages may result in casualties
    and illness. It can also endanger emergency response by medical personnel and
    firefighters, as well as have a negative influence on food supply and transportation
    infrastructure. [15]. The NIS (Network and Information Security) Directive goal
    is to ensure a unified legislative framework for cybersecurity in the EU. Active
    entities in the sectors of transport, healthcare, water, energy, banking, financial
    market infrastructures, and digital infrastructure that have been identified by
    the Member State as operators of essential services must implement appropriate
    security measures and report serious incidents to the national authorities [16].
    The protocol of decision-making process, risk management and assessment in connection
    to the detection of water quality changes is described in Fig. 1. Fig. 1 The protocol
    of decision-making process, risk management and assessment in connection to the
    detection of water quality changes Show All The use of online water quality sensors,
    which allows for the creation of a real-time picture of water quality changes,
    is one alternative for improving water safety. The information about the observed
    change in water quality (or other physical abnormal state) is a significant aspect
    in risk management since it generates a signal that is sent to the water works
    monitoring room via ICT systems, resulting in an alarm. The waterworks staff should
    then apply their knowledge (risk assessment), which should lead to either dismissing
    the observation or initiating corrective mitigation activities. SECTION IV. Technologies
    The trustworthy document can have four different aspects: IoT devices, Cloud Computing,
    Big Data and Blockchain. A. Big Data The majority of Big Data definitions are
    concerned with the amount of data stored. Big Data has other key characteristics,
    such as data velocity and variety, in addition to its capacity. The three Vs of
    Big Data (volume, velocity and variety) provide a comprehensive description, dispelling
    the idea that Big Data is exclusively about data volume. Furthermore, each of
    the three Vs has its own set of analytics concerns, as seen in Fig. 2. Fig. 2.
    The three Vs of Big Data Show All User organizations have been gathering Web data
    for years, but for most organizations, it’s been a kind of storage. RFID data
    from supply chain applications, text data from call centre applications, semi
    structured data from various business-to-business (B2B) operations, and geospatial
    information in logistics were all gathered and stored as similar untapped Big
    Data. The difference is that far more users are now analysing Big Data instead
    of merely hoarding it. The few organizations that have been analysing this data
    are now doing it at a more sophisticated and complex level. The efficient analytical
    leveraging of Big Data is new compared to Big Data itself [17]. In the SWAM project,
    the values of some water parameters (such as PH or others) are measured and stored.
    Also, according to the purpose of the project, SWAM needs to measure and analyse
    the weather features: temperature, humidity, rain and cumulative rain (mm), air
    pressure, wind direction, speed and blow and PYR, soil features (humidity) or
    CO, CO2 footprint. Also, we need to measure soil parameters. For all this, Big
    Data is needed because, for example, in a few weeks we can have even more than
    20.000 measured data. This massive amount of information must be saved and analysed
    [18]. B. Cloud Computing A smart water system is developed to collect actionable
    and useful data about the pressure, flow and distribution of specific water locations.
    Data is acquired from the sensors that are connected to the system. Further, the
    data are analysed and stored in the Cloud where a private server and web-page
    is created on top of the IoT architecture. Cloud computing provides applications
    with the essential infrastructure, such as storage, platform, services, databases,
    and data analysis tools, via the Internet, allowing for faster innovation, more
    flexible resources, and cost reductions. Fig. 3. Cloud Computing Architecture
    Show All Many forms of tools and applications are required in Cloud Computing
    Architecture (Fig. 3): Awareness application: to make the user aware of the quality
    of the water When the water quality exceeded a certain threshold, a smartphone
    can be utilized to alert the user. Control and management application: this program
    allows the water staff to control and adjust the pumping regulations based on
    the data analysed for each zone. Big data analytic tool: analyse the information
    gathered. The data will be gathered and analysed for a period of time determined
    by the end-user in order to improve water quality. The IoT Cloud will offer the
    system with an efficient and reliable architecture for the acquired data, as this
    massive volume of data must be stored and analysed. C. Internet of Things The
    system is focused on monitoring the water, air and weather conditions for irrigation
    in Smart Agriculture by managing, operating the water quality, and improving the
    operation of the surface water network. The sensor network uses a reconfigurable
    wireless transceiver to connect to a Cloud platform and includes multiple low-cost
    sensors that can measure various parameters (Fig. 4). Fig. 4. Internet of Things
    simplified architecture Show All D. Blockchain The proposed architecture for the
    Smart Watering System is presented in Fig. 5. It will have the ability of blockchain
    security. And each transaction made by the system will be tracked during the processes.
    This ability will not only provide security, but it will also give privacy features.
    The smart devices are acting as nodes, and each node is responsible for creating
    a copy of the blockchain. If a user of the system wants to use it, then each node
    has to be verified before a transaction occurs (electronic voting). If the majority
    is considered valid, each of them will be registered in the blockchain structure
    with a hash code. Each copy is then forwarded to be used in the system. The proposed
    system will be updated every 15 minutes, thus it will be impossible to be hacked
    and to forge the security system. Henceforth the requests of the received data
    from each device will be secured via Blockchain. Fig. 5. Smart Watering System
    model based on Blockchain Show All SECTION V. Conclusions The best route for data
    security is to periodically store the values of the monitored water quality parameters
    in its own centralized platform. The information about the water quality is sent
    periodically according to the changes of the values coming from the parameters,
    and the platform receives the information through the security mechanisms with
    the help of a register. To store all this data you also need a timestamp, which
    is stored in the database and finally an encrypted backup is generated in an external
    location to save the information in case of unavailability or data loss. The design
    of the platform and security solutions is a step towards the security and safety
    of accurate data, thus contributing to a good quality of the data monitored in
    the SWAM project. As future work, the most precise controls on cyber threats will
    be considered, such as: a Gateway-which verifies the authenticity of the platform,
    the communication protocols between the Gateway and the platform that uses TLS/SSL
    security (MQTTS / HTTPS). ACKNOWLEDGMENT This work was supported by a grant of

    Privacy Chapter © 2021 1 Introduction Smart agriculture IoT has become popular
    due to its advantages in automatic irrigation and fertilization, crop growth monitoring,
    and pest detection, etc [1, 2]. It is a typical application of IoT and is mostly
    the same as the traditional IoT in terms of architecture, protocol standards,
    wireless communication technology. Differently, to reduce waste of resources,
    minimize environmental impact, and maximize crop yields, most smart agricultural
    applications require to collect and process agricultural data in real-time. Meanwhile,
    the accurate geographical location and the geographical dimension of species are
    very important, which is a critical link in the production and circulation of
    agricultural products. With the widespread application of smart agriculture, the
    amount of agricultural data perceived by IoT devices will greatly increase. However,
    the computational and storage resources of the IoT devices are limited. To alleviate
    the computational and storage pressure on IoT devices and timely process the collected
    data, fog nodes are usually placed at the edge of the agricultural IoT to store
    data and process queries over the stored data [3,4,5,6,7]. Nevertheless, the fog
    node is at the edge of the agricultural IoT, and may not be completely trusted.
    If the data collected by the IoT device is directly exposed to the fog node, it
    will pose a privacy threat to the data [8,9,10,11,12,13,14]. These potential privacy
    threats may result in an unproductive farming environment. For example, if the
    smart agriculture system is not working correctly, it could make a wrong decision
    based on the wrong data, such as over-fertilizing, or not irrigating dry land.
    Some researches on privacy protection have been conducted in the fields of energy,
    healthcare, or transportation [15,16,17,18,19]. However, few studies have focused
    on privacy threats in agriculture. To protect the privacy of agriculture data,
    the commonly used method is that the IoT devices first encrypt their collected
    data and then report them to the fog node. However, the encryption technique will
    inevitably affect data query functions. Among these query functions, the range-max
    query is one of the most common queries. The range-max query is to obtain the
    maximum data in a specific region. For clarity, we give an example of the range-max
    query as follows: Example 1 Suppose there are 4 × 4 agriculture IoT devices deployed
    in the whole field to monitor the growth of crops. Each IoT device is responsible
    for collecting crop growth data and reporting the data and its location to the
    fog node. And then, the fog node receives 16 triples, as shown in Fig. 1. For
    example, (16, 0, 0) represents that the data of the crop growth collected by the
    IoT device at location (0,0) is 16. When the query user wants to know the crop
    that grows best in the rectangular range Q = [1, 2] × [1, 2] marked with a red
    border in Fig. 1, he/she sends the query range Q to the fog node and will receive
    the maximum value 20 of the location (2,1) in that range returned by the fog node.
    Fig. 1 An example of the range-max query Full size image However, the range-max
    query over the ciphertext data is more challenging than that over plaintext data.
    To the best of our knowledge, existing works focus on either privacy-preserving
    max/min query or range query [20,21,22,23,24,25,26]. No previous work has addressed
    the privacy-preserving range-max queries in smart agriculture IoT. In response
    to this challenge, we present an efficient privacy-preserving range-max query
    scheme in fog-based smart agriculture IoT. The main contributions of this paper
    are fourfold as follows. First, we build the K2-treap which be used to store the
    data collected by agriculture IoT devices and support efficient range-max query
    and dynamic data update. Second, we design a data encryption and comparison algorithm
    based on BGN homomorphic encryption technique, which can not only securely compare
    two data based on their ciphertexts but also support the incremental updates directly
    over ciphertexts. Third, based on the K2-treap and our data encryption and comparison
    algorithm, we present an efficient privacy-preserving range-max query scheme.
    Notably, our comparison technique and range-max queries are run by the fog node,
    so there are no interactions between the agricultural IoT devices and the fog
    node during the comparison and query. Finally, we conduct a detailed security
    analysis, and the results show that the scheme we proposed can indeed protect
    privacy. Through performance evaluation, the experimental test results prove that
    our proposed scheme is efficient. The rest of this paper is arranged as follows.
    In Section 2, we describe our models, namely the system model and the security
    model, and the design goals. In Section 3, we introduce the preliminary. Then,
    we present our proposed scheme in Section 4. In Section 5 and Section 6, we conduct
    security analysis and performance evaluation respectively. Some related works
    are discussed in Section 7. Finally, we summarize our work and clarify the content
    of future research in Section 8. 2 Our models and design goals In this section,
    we first describe our models, namely the system model and the security model,
    and then propose our design goals. 2.1 System model Our system model with the
    privacy-preserving range-max query in the fog-based agricultural IoT is mainly
    composed of four types of entities, namely, service provider, agricultural IoT
    devices, fog node, and query user, as shown in Fig. 2. Service provider: The service
    provider is responsible for the whole system. To remotely monitor crop growth
    in the field, The service provider divides the filed evenly into 2n × 2n equal
    cells and deploys the agriculture IoT devices in each cell. Due to the limited
    storage space and computational capacity of the IoT devices, the service provider
    deploys a fog node at the edge of the agricultural IoT to help the IoT device
    complete data storage and processing. The data stored in the fog node is available
    for query from those users authorized by the service provider. Agriculture IoT
    devices: In the system, there are 2n × 2n IoT devices, and they are distributed
    in the whole field to monitor the growth of the crops. In specific, the IoT device
    Ix, y is distributed in the location (x, y) and responsible for collecting the
    data Dx, y of the cell (x, y), where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 2n − 1 and Dx, y ∈ [0, l]. Let
    (Dx, y, x, y) denote a triple tuple of the IoT device Ix, y. Then, the data collected
    by all IoT devices can be denoted as \\({\\mathbb {D}} = \\{(D_{x,y}, x,y)| 0
    \\leq x,y \\leq 2^{n}-1)\\}\\). To prevent the fog node from knowing the collected
    data, each Ix, y encrypts the data Dx, y before sending it to the fog node. Thus,
    the fog node can receive an encrypted dataset \\([\\![ {\\mathbb {D}} ]\\!] =
    \\{([\\![ D_{x,y} ]\\!], x,y)\\) |0 ≤ x, y ≤ 2n − 1} from all IoT devices, where
    ⟦Dx, y⟧ denotes the ciphertext of Dx, y. Fog node: When fog node receives encrypted
    dataset \\([\\![ {\\mathbb {D}} ]\\!] = \\{([\\![ D_{x,y} ]\\!], x,y)\\) |0 ≤
    x, y ≤ 2n − 1} from all IoT devices, it can provide the range-max query service
    to query users. Specifically, when the fog node receives a range-max query request
    in the form of Q = [x1, x2] × [y1, y2], it will search the encrypted dataset and
    return the encrypted maximum data, i.e., ⟦Dmax⟧, within the query rectangular
    range Q = [x1, x2] × [y1, y2], where \\(D_{max} = {\\max \\limits } \\{D_{x,y}|
    x_{1} \\leq x \\leq x_{2}; y_{1} \\leq y \\leq y_{2}\\}\\). In addition, the fog
    node allows agriculture IoT devices to dynamically update their data in ciphtexts.
    For example, when the agriculture IoT device Ix, y collects a new incremented
    data Dx, y′ at location (x, y), and it can send corresponding encrypted data \\([\\![
    D^{\\prime }_{x,y} ]\\!]\\) to the fog node. Then, the fog node will calculate
    \\([\\![ D_{x,y} ]\\!]\\cdot [\\![ D^{\\prime }_{x,y} ]\\!]\\) to obtain \\([\\![
    D_{x,y} + D^{\\prime }_{x,y} ]\\!]\\) and use \\([\\![ D_{x,y} + D^{\\prime }_{x,y}
    ]\\!]\\) to update the value ⟦Dx, y⟧ on the location (x, y) node. Query user:
    The user must first register with the service provider to access the fog node.
    Then the service provider will assign a key to the registered user. Only those
    users authorized by the service provider can access the fog node for data queries.
    When the query user wants to know the crop that grows best in the rectangular
    range Q = [x1, x2] × [y1, y2], he/she sends the query range Q to the fog node
    and receives the maximum value ⟦Dmax⟧ in that range and the corresponding location
    (xmax, ymax), returned by the fog node. Finally, The query user uses the key to
    recover the Dmax from the encrypted ⟦Dmax⟧. Fig. 2 System model Full size image
    2.2 Security model In our security model, the service provider is considered trusted
    and is responsible for system initialization and key distribution. For the agriculture
    IoT devices, they are considered honest, and always keep in good condition, i.e.,
    they will follow the protocol sincerely and send the real encrypted value and
    the correct location \\([\\![ {\\mathbb {D}} ]\\!]= \\{([\\![ D_{x,y} ]\\!], x,y)|
    0 \\leq x,y \\leq 2^{n}-1\\}\\) to the fog node. For the fog node, it is considered
    honesty-but-curious. That is, it will comply with the protocol to store or update
    the encrypted data ⟦Dx, y⟧ at the location (x, y), and run query algorithm correctly
    to respond to the authorized user’s range-max query. However, it may be curious
    about some private information, such as the plaintext of values from agriculture
    IoT devices and the corresponding query results of the authorized user. For the
    query users, they are honest, i.e., they will honestly comply with the protocol
    to submit the range-max queries. Besides, we assume that there is no collusion
    between query users and the fog node. This assumption is reasonable because the
    penalty of collusion for the involving fog node is very high, including losing
    the trust of users and being prosecuted. Of course, there may be active attacks
    such as damage to IoT devices. Since we are focusing on protecting privacy in
    this paper, the active attacks are no longer within the scope of this article,
    and it will be our work in the future. 2.3 Design goals Based on the system model
    described in Section 2.1 and the security model described in Section 2.2, we present
    an efficient and privacy-preserving range-max query scheme. In particular, the
    following two goals should be achieved. Privacy protection: Privacy protection
    is the basic requirement of our paper. That is to say, the data collected by IoT
    devices and the corresponding query results of query users should be kept confidential
    from the fog node. Dynamic update: In addition to privacy protection requirements,
    the proposed scheme should also support the dynamic update of IoT devices’ data
    in the ciphertext. Specifically, when the data collected by IoT devices Ix, y
    changes, the proposed scheme should support the fog node to dynamically update
    corresponding encrypted data ⟦Dx, y⟧ stored in it. 3 Preliminary In this section,
    we will outline some knowledge related to our proposed scheme, namely the bilinear
    pairing with composite order and the BGN homomorphic encryption[27]. 3.1 Bilinear
    pairing with composite order Let N = pq, where p, q are two different large prime
    numbers of the same length. \\(\\mathbb {G}\\) and \\(\\mathbb {G}_{T}\\) are
    two multiplicative cyclic groups with composite order N. The group can be instantiated
    by the elliptic curve addition group. The bilinear map can be computed in polynomial
    time. We assume that the discrete logarithm problems in both \\(\\mathbb {G}\\)
    and \\(\\mathbb {G}_{T}\\) are hard. If the map \\(e : \\mathbb {G} \\times \\mathbb
    {G} \\to \\mathbb {G}_{T}\\) has the following properties, this map is called
    bilinear map with composite order. Bilinearity: For any \\((g, h) \\in \\mathbb
    {G} \\times \\mathbb {G}\\) and \\(a, b \\in \\mathbb {Z}_{N}\\), we have e(ga,
    hb) = e(g, h)ab; Non-degeneracy: There is a generator \\(g \\in \\mathbb {G}\\),
    so that e(g, g) is with the order N in \\(\\mathbb {G}_{T}\\). At the same time,
    e(g, g) is a generator of \\( \\mathbb {G}_{T}\\). Computability: For all \\((g,
    h) \\in \\mathbb {G}\\), there is an algorithm that can efficiently compute \\(e(g,
    h) \\in \\mathbb {G}_{T}\\). Definition 1 Composite Bilinear Generator Let \\({\\mathcal
    {C}\\mathcal {G}}{en}\\) be a composite bilinear parameter generator, and κ is
    a security parameter. According to the following process, the \\({\\mathcal {C}\\mathcal
    {G}}{en}\\) can output a 5-tuple \\((N, \\mathbb {G}, \\mathbb {G}_{T}, g, e)\\)
    in probability polynomial time. (1) Let N = pq, where p, q are two randomly generated
    κ-bit prime numbers. (2) Generate two groups \\(\\mathbb {G}\\), \\(\\mathbb {G}_{T}\\)
    with order N, and select a generator g for \\(\\mathbb {G}\\). Then, construct
    a bilinear map \\(e: \\mathbb {G} \\times \\mathbb {G} \\to \\mathbb {G}_{T}\\)
    as mentioned above. (3) Output the parameters \\((N, \\mathbb {G}, \\mathbb {G}_{T},
    g,e)\\). Let g be a generator of \\(\\mathbb {G}\\), then \\(\\mathbf {g} = g^{q}
    \\in \\mathbb {G}\\) can construct the subgroup \\(\\mathbb {G}_{p} = \\{ \\mathbf
    {g}^{0}, \\mathbf {g}^{1}, \\cdots , \\mathbf {g}^{p-1}\\}\\) with order p, and
    \\(\\mathbf {g}^{\\prime } = g^{p} \\in \\mathbb {G}\\) can construct the subgroup
    \\(\\mathbb {G}_{q} = \\{\\mathbf {g}^{\\prime 0}, \\mathbf {g}^{\\prime 1}, \\cdots
    , \\mathbf {g}^{\\prime q-1} \\}\\) with order q in \\(\\mathbb {G}\\). Given
    a tuple \\((N, \\mathbb {G}, \\mathbb {G}_{T}, e, h)\\), determining whether h
    is in the subgroup \\(\\mathbb {G}_{q}\\) is called the SubGroup Decision (SGD)
    Problem, where \\(h \\in \\mathbb {G}\\) or \\(h \\in \\mathbb {G}_{q}\\). Since
    the SGD problem is hard [28], it can be ensured that the following BGN homomorphic
    encryption is safe. 3.2 BGN Homomorphic encryption The BGN is a popular homomorphic
    public-key encryption that was originally proposed by Boneh, Goh, and Nissim in
    [27]. It includes three phases: key generation, encryption, and decryption. Key
    Generation: Let κ be the security parameter, the generator \\(\\mathcal {C}\\mathcal
    {{G}}{en}\\) outputs a 5-tuple \\((N, \\mathbb {G}, \\mathbb {G}_{T}, g,e)\\),
    where the 5 parameters are described as above. Let h = gq, and it can construct
    a subgroup of \\({\\mathbb {G}}\\) of order p. That is, h is a random generator.
    Therefore, the public key is \\(pk = (N, {\\mathbb {G}}, {\\mathbb {G}}_{T}, g,
    e, h)\\), and the private key is sk = p. Encryption: Assuming that the message
    space is \\(\\mathbb {S} = \\{0, 1, \\cdots , T \\}\\), where T ≪ q. Use \\(C=
    E(m) = g^{m} h^{r} \\in \\mathbb {G}\\) to encrypt a message \\(m \\in \\mathbb
    {S}\\), where \\(r \\in {\\mathbb {Z}}_{N}\\) is a random number. Decryption:
    Given a ciphertext C = E(m), the plaintext m can be recovered in the following
    two steps. (1) Compute Cp = (gmhr)p = (gp)m. (2) Let \\(\\hat {g} = g^{p}\\),
    recover m from (gp)m by computing the discrete log of Cp base \\(\\hat {g}\\)
    with the Pollard’s lambda method [29]. Based on the SubGroup Decision(SGD) Problem
    assumption, BGN is provably secure against chosen-plaintext attacks. For the detailed
    security analysis please refer to [27]. BGN encryption has the following homomorphic
    properties. Addition: Given E(m1) and E(m2), we have \\(E(m_{1}) \\cdot E(m_{2})
    \\rightarrow E(m_{1} + m_{2})\\). Multiplication-I: Given E(m1) and m2, we have
    \\(E(m_{1})^{m_{2}} \\rightarrow E(m_{1}\\cdot m_{2})\\). Self-Blinding: Given
    E(m1) and \\(h^{r_{2}}\\), we have \\(E(m_{1}) \\cdot h^{r_{2}} \\rightarrow E(m_{1})\\).
    Multiplication-II: Given E(m1) and E(m2), we have \\(e(E(m_{1}), E(m_{2}))\\rightarrow
    E^{\\prime }(m_{1}\\cdot m_{2}) \\in \\mathbb {G}_{T}\\), where \\(E^{\\prime
    }()\\) represents a ciphertext in \\({\\mathbb {G}}_{T}\\). 4 Our proposed scheme
    In this section, we present our efficient and privacy-preserving range-max query
    scheme in fog-based agricultural IoT. Before going into details, we first introduce
    a tree structure, called K2-treap, and a privacy-preserving encryption scheme,
    a privacy-preserving comparison protocol, which are several important components
    of our proposed scheme. 4.1 The K2-treap The K2-treap is a quadtree structure
    and also has the max heap property. Specifically, each internal node in the K2-treap
    has four children, and the value of child nodes is less than that of their parent
    node. With the max heap property, the K2-treap can effectively support the range-max
    query. In the following, we will introduce three algorithms about the K2-treap
    including tree building, dynamic update, and range-max query. 4.1.1 Tree building
    Suppose that the dataset \\(\\mathbb {D}\\) is a location-based dataset, and it
    is in the form of \\(\\mathbb {D} = \\{(D_{x,y}, x,y)| 0 \\leq x,y \\leq 2^{n}-1)\\}\\),
    where (x, y) is a location and Dx, y is the value in (x, y), as shown in Fig.
    3. Based on the dataset \\(\\mathbb {D}\\), we can build a K2-treap KT from bottom
    to top as follows. Step 1: Build the leaf nodes of the K2-treap KT. Specifically,
    for each value \\(D_{x,y} \\in \\mathbb {D}\\), build a leaf node (Dx, y, x, y).
    Thus, the side length of the area covered by each leaf node can be denoted as
    L = 20. Step 2: Build the higher level of the K2-treap KT based on the leaf nodes.
    As shown in Fig. 3, from the upper-left node of the whole area, we can gradually
    merge four leaf nodes in a square into an internal node. In the internal node,
    it contains 7 attributes {AID,CID, c1, c2, c3, c4, p}. AID is used to describe
    the area that is covered by the current node. The area is a square and it can
    be denoted as AID = (xleft, ytop, L), where (xleft, ytop) is the upper-left location
    of the area, and L is the side length of the area. In this level, since there
    are 2 × 2 values in the area of the square, the side length of the area is L =
    21. CID is used to describe the max value and its corresponding location of this
    area. It can be denoted as CID = (data, x, y), where data is the max value in
    this square, i.e., \\(data = \\max \\limits \\{D_{x,y}|x \\in [x_{left},x_{left}
    + L], y \\in [ y_{top},y_{top} + L]\\}\\), and (x, y) is the location of data.
    For c1, c2, c3, c4, they are pointers to the children of the current internal
    node. Without loss of generality, we assume that c1, c2, c3, c4 respectively point
    to the upper-left node, upper-right node, lower-left node, and lower-right node
    of this area. Meanwhile, the internal node has a pointer p that points to its
    parent, and it will be assigned when the next higher level is built. When constructing
    this level, we let the parent pointers of the leaf nodes in this area point to
    the current internal node. Step 3: Build the next higher level of the K2-treap
    KT based on the internal nodes constructed in step 2. From the upper-leaf node,
    gradually merge four internal nodes in a square into an internal node and assign
    the attributes of the internal node with the same method in step 2. Differently,
    in this level, the area covered by each internal node contains 22 × 22 values,
    the side length of the square is L = 22. Step 4: Repeat step 3 until there is
    only one merged node, i.e., the root node. After this step, a K2-treap KT is constructed.
    Fig. 3 The K2-treap structure Full size image Example 2 There is a dataset with
    4 × 4 elements. We can use the dataset to build the K2-treap KT, as shown in Fig.
    4. The building process of the KT is as follows: Step 1: Build the leaf nodes
    of the KT. Each element of the dataset can be used to build the leaf node of the
    KT. At the same time, the side length of the area is L = 20. Step 2: Build the
    higher level of the KT based on the leaf nodes. From the upper-left node of the
    whole area, we gradually merge four leaf nodes in a square into an internal node,
    and obtain 2 × 2 internal nodes. The value of each internal node is the maximum
    data of the current square. The CID of the four internal nodes are (16,0,0),(9,0,3),(20,2,1),(21,2,3).The
    AID of the four internal nodes are (0,0, L = 21),(0,2, L = 21),(2,0, L = 21),
    (2,2, L = 21). Each internal node’s four child-pointers c1, c2, c3, c4 respectively
    point to the upper-left node, upper-right node, lower-left node, and lower-right
    node of this area. At the same time, the side length of the area is L = 21. Step
    3: Build the next higher level of the KT based on the internal nodes constructed
    in Step 2, we merge the four internal nodes in a square. There is only one merged
    node, which is the root node of the KT. The AID of the root node is (0,0, L =
    22), the CID of the root node is (21,2,3). In this case, we can get the maximum
    data 21 of the whole dataset and the corresponding location (2,3) from the CID
    of the root node. Fig. 4 An example of K2-treap building Full size image 4.1.2
    Range-max Query When the K2-treap KT is built, it can efficiently support range-max
    query. In specific, given a query range Q = [x1, x2] × [y1, y2], we can search
    KT to find out the maximum value among all values within the range Q, i.e., \\(D_{max}
    = \\max \\limits \\{D_{x,y}| (x,y) \\in Q\\}\\). The query process can be performed
    as the following steps. Step 1: Initialize a stack S = ∅, Dmax = 0, (xmax, ymax)
    = (0,0). The stack will be used to store the selected nodes whose AID intersects
    with Q. Dmax represents the maximum value in the range Q, (xmax, ymax) is the
    location where the maximum value locates in. Step 2: Push the root node of the
    KT into the stack. Step 3: If the stack is not empty, pop a node from the stack,
    and denote it by N. If the location (x, y) of the N.CID is in the query range
    Q and the data N.CID.data is larger than Dmax, then update Dmax and (xmax, ymax).
    If the location (x, y) of the node N.CID is not in the query range Q, we select
    its child-nodes whose AID has an intersection with Q and push them into the stack
    S. Step 4: Repeat Step 3, until the stack is empty. Note that, the query area
    Q in the algorithm is a regular rectangle, the algorithm can query the maximum
    value of any irregular region, as any irregular region can ultimately be made
    up of multiple cells. 4.1.3 Dynamic update When the value Dx, y of the node N
    at the location (x, y) in the K2-treap KT has changed, the incremented value is
    \\(D^{\\prime }_{x,y}\\). The KT can be dynamically updated by comparing the value
    of the node with the value of its parent. The dynamical update process of the
    KT is as follows: Step 1: Jump from the root node to the corresponding location
    of the node N in the leaf node according to the (x, y); Step 2: Update the data
    Dx, y of the node’s N.CID with new data \\(D_{x,y}+D^{\\prime }_{x,y}\\). Step
    3: Compare the data N.CID.data with the data N.p.CID.data, If the data N.CID.data
    > N.p.CID.data, then update the N.p.CID.data with the N.CID.data, and use N to
    represent the parent node. Step 4: Repeat Step 3, until the node is root or N.CID.data
    ≤ N.p.CID.data. 4.2 The data encryption and comparison technique In this subsection,
    we present data encryption and comparison technique, which can achieve data encryption
    and encrypted data comparison. This technique is based on BGN homomorphic encryption
    technique, and it involves three parties, i.e., data encryptor, data decryptor,
    and data comparator. The data encryptor is responsible for encrypting the data.
    The data comparator can achieve encrypted data comparison. The decryptor can recover
    plaintexts from encrypted data. In specific, our data encryption and data comparison
    protocol technique consist of four algorithms, i.e., key generation, encryption,
    decryption, and data comparison. Key generation: Let κ be the security parameter,
    the key generation algorithm first outputs a 5-tuple \\((N, \\mathbb {G}, \\mathbb
    {G}_{T}, g, e)\\) by running \\({\\mathcal {C}\\mathcal {G}}{en}(\\kappa )\\),
    where N = pq. Then, let h = gq, the BGN public key is \\(pk = (N, {\\mathbb {G}},
    {\\mathbb {G}}_{T}, g, e, h)\\), and the private key is sk = p. Further, the algorithm
    selects a hash function \\(H : \\{0, 1\\}^{*} \\to {\\mathbb {Z}}_{N}\\), and
    also selects two secret keys \\(s, t \\in {\\mathbb {Z}}_{N}\\). In addition,
    to enable the data comparator to compare encrypted data, the key generation algorithm
    generates a set of hash values \\({\\mathbb {H}} = \\{H(e(g, g)^{pstx}) | x \\in
    (0, l]\\}\\). Finally, the key generation algorithm respectively distributes gs,
    (s− 1p), and \\((g^{pt}, {\\mathbb {H}})\\) to the encryptor, decryptor, and data
    comparator. Meanwhile, it publishes the public key pk, and hash function H. Encryption:
    Given a plaintext m ∈ (0, l], the data encryptor can encrypt m as $$ [\\![ m ]\\!
    ]= E(m)= (g^{s})^{m} \\cdot h^{r} $$ (1) where \\(r \\in \\mathbb {Z}_{N}\\) is
    a random number. Decryption: Given a ciphertext ⟦m⟧ = E(m), the decryptor first
    computes $$ \\begin{array}{@{}rcl@{}} {[\\![ m ]\\!]}^{s^{-1}p} = {((g^{s})^{m}}
    \\cdot {h^{r}})^{s^{-1}p}= (g^{p})^{m}. \\end{array} $$ (2) Then, the decryptor
    can recover m from (gp)m by computing the discrete log of (gp)m base gp with the
    Pollard’s lambda method [29]. Data comparison: Given two encrypted data ⟦m1⟧ and
    ⟦m2⟧, the data comparator can compare them. Specifically, the data comparator
    first computes $$ \\begin{array}{@{}rcl@{}} X = e\\left( \\frac{[\\![ m_{1} ]\\!]}{[\\![
    m_{2} ]\\!]}, g^{pt} \\right) = e(g, g)^{pst(m_{1}-m_{2})} \\end{array} $$ (3)
    Then, if \\(X = 1_{\\mathbb {G}_{T}}\\), we can directly have m1 = m2. If \\(H(X)
    \\in \\mathbb {H}\\), m1 > m2. Otherwise, m1 < m2. Correctness. The correctness
    of the data encryption and comparison technique is follows: Assume ⟦m1⟧ and ⟦m2⟧
    are two encrypted values, $$ \\begin{aligned} \\frac{[\\![ m_{1} ]\\!]}{[\\![m_{2}
    ]\\!]} &= \\frac{{(g^{s})^{m_{1}}} \\cdot h^{r_{1}}}{{(g^{s})^{m_{2}} }\\cdot
    h^{r_{2}}}\\\\ &={ g^{s(m_{1}-m_{2})}} \\cdot h^{r_{1}-r_{2}} \\end{aligned} $$
    Then, we have $$ \\begin{aligned} X &= e\\left( \\frac{[\\![m_{1} ]\\!]}{[\\![m_{2}
    ]\\!]}, g^{pt}\\right) = e(g^{s(m_{1}-m2)}\\cdot h^{r_{1} -r_{2}}, g^{pt})\\\\
    &= e(g, g)^{pst(m_{1}-m_{2})} \\cdot e(h, g)^{pt(r_{1} -r_{2})}\\\\ &= e(g, g)^{pst(m_{1}-m_{2})}
    \\cdot 1 = e(g, g)^{pst(m_{1}-m_{2})} \\end{aligned} $$ Clearly, if m1 − m2 > 0,
    i.e. m1 > m2, then m1 − m2 ∈ (0, l] and we know H(X) will appear in \\(\\mathbb
    {H}\\). if \\(X = 1_{\\mathbb {G}_{T}}\\), we can directly have m1 = m2. If m1
    < m2, H(Xi) will not appear in \\(\\mathbb {H}\\). Therefore, the correctness
    of the data encryption and comparison technique holds. 4.3 The details of our
    scheme In this subsection, we present our privacy-preserving range-max query scheme,
    which contains four phases, i.e., system initialization, data transmission, range-max
    query, and dynamic update. 4.3.1 System initialization In the system initialization,
    the service provider is responsible for bootstrapping the whole scheme.As the
    key generation algorithm in Section 4.2, the service provider generates the public
    pk and the private key sk, where \\(pk = (N, \\mathbb {G}, \\mathbb {G}_{T}, e,
    g, h)\\), sk = p. Further, the service provider chooses a cryptographic hash function
    \\(H : \\{0, 1\\}^{*} \\to \\mathbb {Z}_{N}\\), and two secret keys \\(s, t \\in
    \\mathbb {Z}_{N}\\). Finally, the service provider keeps (p, s, t) secretly, respectively
    distributes gs, (s− 1p), and \\((g^{pt}, \\mathbb {H})\\) to the IoT devices,
    the authorized query use, and fog node. Meanwhile, it publishes the public key
    pk, and hash function H. The hash function is constructed as described in Section
    4.2. 4.3.2 Data transmission In this phase, The IoT device transmits its data
    to the fog node as follows: Step 1: IoT device Ix, y uses gs and a random number
    \\(r_{x,y} \\in \\mathbb {Z}_{N} \\) to encrypt Dx, y as $$ \\begin{array}{@{}rcl@{}}
    [\\![D_{x,y}]\\!] =E(D_{x,y})= (g^{s})^{D_{x,y}} \\cdot h^{r_{x,y}} \\end{array}
    $$ (4) where \\(r_{x,y} \\in \\mathbb {Z}_{N}, 0 \\leq x,y \\leq 2^{n}-1, D_{x,y}
    \\in {\\mathbb {D}}\\). Step 2: IoT device Ix, y sends the encrypted data ⟦Dx,
    y⟧ and corresponding location (x, y) to the fog node. Step 3: From all IoT devices,
    the fog node receives an encrypted dataset \\([\\![{\\mathbb {D}}]\\!] = \\{([\\![D_{x,y}]\\!],
    x,y)| 0 \\leq x,y \\leq 2^{n}-1)\\}\\). Based on the encrypted dataset, the fog
    node builds a K2-treap KT as described in Section 4.1.1. Since the fog node cannot
    access the plaintext dataset \\({\\mathbb {D}}\\), it will face a challenge, that
    is how to compare the sizes of these encrypted data. For solving the challenge,
    the fog node can run privacy-preserving data comparisons described in Section
    4.2. In this case, the node in the KT contains 7 attributes {AID,CID, c1, c2,
    c3, c4, p} as described in Section 4.1.1. The only difference is that the data
    of the CID is encrypted. 4.3.3 Range-max query When the KT is built by fog node,
    it can efficiently support range-max query over the encrypted data as follows:
    Step 1: If an authorized query user wants to know which crops grow best in a range,
    it needs to send the query range Q to the fog node, where Q = [x1, x2] × [y1,
    y2]. Step 2: The fog node runs the range-max query algorithm as described in Section
    4.1. Due to the data of the node’s CID in the KT is encrypted, it is a challenge
    for the fog node to compare ⟦Dmax⟧ < ⟦N.CID.data⟧. In this case, the fog node
    needs to run privacy-preserving data comparisons described in Section 4.2, then
    returns the maximum encrypted value⟦Dmax⟧and corresponding location xmax, ymax
    to the authorized query user. i.e., \\([\\![D_{max} ]\\!]= \\max \\limits \\{
    [\\![D_{x,y}]\\!]|\\) (x, y) ∈ Q}. Step 3: Once the query user receives the value⟦Dmax⟧
    and location xmax, ymax, he/she can use the key (s− 1p) assigned by the service
    provider to perform the following calculation. $$ \\begin{aligned} ({[\\![ {\\mathbb{D}}_{max}
    ]\\!]})^{s^{-1}p}=((g^{s})^{D_{max}} \\cdot h^{r})^{(s^{-1} p)}=(g^{p})^{D_{max}}
    \\end{aligned} $$ Let \\(\\hat {g} = g^{p}\\). It can recover Dmax from ⟦Dmax⟧
    by computing the discrete log of (\\({[\\![D_{max}]\\!]})^{s^{-1}p}\\) base \\(\\hat
    {g}\\) with the Pollard’s lambda method [29]. 4.3.4 Dynamic update When the agriculture
    IoT device monitors that the value at the location (x, y) has changed, the incremented
    value is \\(D^{\\prime }_{x,y}\\). The K2-treap KT can be dynamically updated
    by fog node as follows: Step 1: IoT device Ix, y first encrypts the value \\(D^{\\prime
    }_{x,y}\\) using the data encryption algorithm as described in Section 4.2, then
    sends the ciphertext \\([\\![ D^{\\prime }_{x,y} ]\\!] \\) and the corresponding
    location (x, y) to fog node. Step 2: When the fog node receives the encrypted
    data \\( [\\![ D^{\\prime }_{x,y} ]\\!] \\) and location x, y, it first computes
    \\( [\\![ D_{x,y} ]\\!] \\cdot [\\![ D^{\\prime }_{x,y} ]\\!] \\), then obtains
    the encrypted data \\([\\![ D_{x,y}+D^{\\prime }_{x,y} ]\\!] \\) according to
    the additional property of the BGN homomorphic encryption. Step 3: Since the fog
    node only knows the encrypted data of the node CID, it will face a challenge,
    that is how to compare ⟦N.CID.data⟧ > ⟦N.p.CID.data]], where N represents the
    node with the value \\([\\![D_{x,y}+D^{\\prime }_{x,y} ]\\!]\\) at the location
    (x, y). For solving the challenge, the fog node can run privacy-preserving data
    comparisons described in Section 4.2 . Step 4: Repeat Step 3, until the node is
    root or ⟦N.CID.data⟧ ≤ ⟦N.p.CID.data⟧. 5 Security analysis In this section, we
    will conduct the security analysis of our proposed privacy-preserving range-max
    query scheme. Since the privacy-preserving data encryption and privacy-preserving
    comparison technique are two important components of our scheme, we first analyze
    their security. After that, we conduct the security analysis of our proposed scheme.
    5.1 Security of data encryption and comparison technique Our data encryption and
    comparison technique consist of data encryption and data comparison algorithm.
    In the following, we show that both of them are secure. For our data encryption
    technique, the data is encrypted as ⟦m⟧ = E(m) = (gs)m ⋅ hr. It is very similar
    to the BGN homomorphic encryption scheme, in which a data m is encrypted as ⟦m⟧
    = E(m) = (g)m ⋅ hr. Since BGN encryption scheme is semantically secure, our encryption
    technique is also semantically secure. Meanwhile, compared with BGN encryption
    technique, our encryption technique involves an additional secret key s, so our
    scheme is even more secure. Thus, our data encryption technique is secure and
    it is hard to recover the plaintext m without the private key s− 1p. For our data
    comparison algorithm, given two encrypted data \\({[\\![ m_{1} ]\\!]} = (g^{s})^{m_{1}}
    \\cdot {h^{r}}\\), \\({[\\![ m_{2} ]\\!]} = (g^{s})^{m_{2}} \\cdot {h^{r}}\\),
    the data comparator can use the key gpt to compute \\(X = e\\left (\\frac {[\\![m_{1}
    ]\\!]}{[\\![m_{2} ]\\!]}, g^{pt}\\right )\\) \\(= e(g, g)^{pst(m_{1}-m_{2})}\\).
    Then, the data comparator can deduce the comparison relationship between m1 and
    m2 by computing H(X) and judging whether H(X) is in the \\({\\mathbb {H}}\\).
    If \\(X =1_{\\mathbb {G}_{T}}\\), the data comparator can directly have m1 = m2.
    Actually, the data comparison algorithm pursues the comparison of data on basis
    of protecting privacy, so the comparison relationship cannot be regarded as private
    information. However, the data comparator cannot have access to the plaintext
    of m1 − m2. This is because the data comparator has no idea on the secret key
    s, it is hard for it to recover the plaintext m1 − m2 from \\(e(g, g)^{pst(m_{1}-m_{2})}\\).
    Thus, the data comparison algorithm is secure. 5.2 Security of our proposed scheme
    In our security model described in Section 2.2, we assume that there is no collusion
    between the fog node and the query user. That is the query user will not share
    the key s− 1p assigned by the service provider with the fog node. Based on this
    assumption, we will confirm that our proposed scheme can achieve the privacy-preserving
    properties, i.e. (1) The dataset \\({\\mathbb {D}}\\) is privacy-preserving; (2)
    The query result Dmax is privacy-preserving; (3) The updated data is privacy-preserving.
    The dataset \\({\\mathbb {D}}\\) is privacy-preserving: In our scheme, IoT device
    Ix, y first encrypts data as \\( [\\![D_{x,y}]\\!] = (g^{s})^{D_{x,y}} \\cdot
    h^{r_{x,y}} ,0 \\leq x,y \\leq 2^{n}-1\\), and then sends ⟦Dx, y⟧ to the fog node.
    Thus, the fog node can access an encrypted dataset \\([\\![{\\mathbb {D}}]\\!]\\).
    Since our data encryption technique is semantically secure, the fog node can not
    recover Dx, y from ⟦Dx, y⟧ of the encrypted dataset \\([\\![{\\mathbb {D}}]\\!]\\)
    without knowing the decryption key s− 1p. As a result, the dataset \\({\\mathbb
    {D}}\\) is privacy-preserving. The query result Dmax is privacy-preserving: In
    our scheme, given a query range Q = [x1, x2] × [y1, y2], the fog node can find
    the maximum encrypted value ⟦Dmax⟧ in this query range and return it. Because
    \\(D_{max} \\in {\\mathbb {D}}\\) is encrypted like \\( [\\![D_{max}]\\!] = (g^{s})^{D_{max}}
    \\cdot h^{r_{x,y}}\\), and our data encryption and comparison algorithm is secure,
    the fog node can not recover the Dmax from ⟦Dmax⟧ without the decryption key s− 1p.
    The Dmax in range Q is privacy-preserving. The updated data is privacy-preserving:
    In our scheme, once the fog node receives a new encrypted incremented value \\(
    [\\![ D^{\\prime }_{x,y} ]\\!] \\) at location (x, y) from the I(x, y), the fog
    node first computes \\( [\\![ D_{x,y} ]\\!] \\cdot [\\![ D^{\\prime }_{x,y} ]\\!]
    \\) to obtain the encrypted data \\([\\![ D_{x,y}+D^{\\prime }_{x,y} ]\\!] \\),
    then uses \\([\\![D^{\\prime }_{x,y}+D_{x,y}]\\!]\\) to update the original value
    ⟦Dx, y⟧ at the location (x, y) in the K2-treap. Because \\(D^{\\prime }_{x,y}
    \\in {\\mathbb {D}}\\) is encrypted like \\( [\\![D^{\\prime }_{x,y}]\\!] = (g^{s})^{D^{\\prime
    }_{x,y}} \\cdot h^{r_{x,y}}\\), and our data encryption and comparison algorithm
    is secure, the fog node can not recover the \\(D^{\\prime }_{x,y}\\) from \\([\\![D^{\\prime
    }_{x,y}[\\!]\\) without the decryption key s− 1p. Therefore, the updated data
    is secret to the fog node. 6 Performance evaluation In this section, we evaluate
    the performance of the range-max query scheme by using the time for the fog node
    to complete the update of K2 -treap and the time of the range-max query. To the
    best of our knowledge, existing works either focus on privacy-preserving range
    query, top-k query, or max query. No previous work has addressed the privacy-preserving
    range-max queries in smart agriculture IoT. Therefore we compare our proposed
    scheme(w/ K2-treap) with the scheme without integrating the K2-treap(w/o K2-treap).
    6.1 Experimental setting We use JAVA to implement our scheme, and run our experiments
    on a machine with Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU @2.30GHz, 10GB RAM, and Debian 9 operating
    system. For our scheme, the corresponding parameters are as follows: The encryption
    algorithm’s security parameter κ is 512 bits. The length of the p, q is 512-bit,
    and the length of N is 1024. The numbers of the agriculture IoT devices are 2n
    × 2n, where n = 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. The fog node receives an encrypted dataset \\([\\![
    {\\mathbb {D}} ]\\!] = \\{([\\![ D_{x,y} ]\\!], x,y)| 0 \\leq x,y \\leq 2^{n}-1\\}\\)
    from all IoT devices, where Dx, y ∈ [0, l], l = 500. We run our experiments 22n− 1
    K2-treap updates and 50 range-max queries. 6.2 Experimental results 6.2.1 Update
    time As the scheme without integrating K2-treap does not involve an update procedure,
    we mainly focus on the update time for our proposed scheme. In our experiments,
    the update of K2-treap is performed by randomly generating the location (x, y)
    and the incremented value \\(0\\leq D^{\\prime }_{x,y} \\leq 10\\), where 0 ≤
    x, y ≤ 2n − 1, n = 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. After running 22n− 1 times of updating the
    K2-treap, the statistical results of the updating time is shown in Fig. 5. In
    specific, the dots linked by the green lines represent the average update times
    for varied n, and each violin plot in the diagram has the following properties:
    The bottom and top of the thick black line represent the first and third quartile
    of the data, respectively. The white circle inside each violin denotes the second
    quartile of data. The lowest (resp. highest) datum within the 1.5 interquartile
    range (IQR) of the first (resp. third) quartile is marked by the lower (resp.
    upper) whisker. The grey shades show the probability density of the data at different
    values. Fig. 5 Update time of K2-treap. In this figure, each gray shade indicates
    the update times’ distribution for the corresponding value of n, which shows that
    the upper bound of the update time increases with n. However, the green line shows
    the average update time, which decreases as n increases Full size image For example,
    when n = 3, there are 2n × 2n = 64 data collected by the IoT devices. The K2-treap
    has 64 leaf nodes and its depth is 4, and we run 22n− 1 = 32 updates on the K2-treap.
    Experimental results show that among 32 updates, a quarter of the updates (8 times)
    can be completed in 551.5ms, half of them (16 times) can be completed in 706.4ms,
    and three-quarters (24 times) in 987.9ms finish. In Fig. 5, the bottom, white
    circle, and top of the black box are used to represent them. Meanwhile, the green
    point represents the average time consumption of 32 updates, which is 759.7 ms.
    The other points linked by the green lines represent the average update time when
    n is 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. They are 722.9ms, 763.8ms, 763.4ms, 538.8ms, and 435.9ms,
    respectively. The average time consumption for updating the K2-treap is less than
    800 ms. As shown in Fig. 5, although in rare cases the update time is relatively
    long. This is mainly because that, the upper bound of update time is linear to
    the depth of the K2-treap, which will increase with n. However, as n increases,
    the possibility of updating the same cell decreases, and the frequency of updates
    involving operating internal nodes decreases. Therefore, the average time consumption
    of the update phase decreases as n increases. 6.2.2 Query time To compare the
    query performance, we test the average time consumption for the two schemes to
    handle queries of varied areas ranging from 0.1 × 22n to 1.2 × 22n, and for each
    area of the query range, we randomly generate 50 queries. The average time consumption
    for maximum queries in different query ranges of the two schemes are shown in
    Fig. 6. Fig. 6 Average time consumption for range-max queries of different query
    ranges. In this figure, the average query time of our proposed scheme decreases
    as the area of the query range increases, while that of the scheme without integrating
    the K2-treap is linear to the query range’s area Full size image In the scheme
    without integrating K2-treap, as the query range expands, the number of IoT devices
    within the query range also increases. To find the maximum value in the query
    range, the compared data will also increase. Therefore, the query time of the
    scheme will also increase. The query time of the scheme is related to the numbers
    of data collected by the IoT devices in the query range, therefore the average
    time consumption of the scheme is linear to the area of the query range. However,
    in our scheme(w/ K2-treap), each internal node in the K2-treap has four children,
    and the value of child nodes is less than that of their parent node. With the
    max heap property, the query time of our scheme will not increase with the increase
    of the query range. Specifically, when the query range covers the whole field,
    the data of the root of the K2-treap is the maximum value in the query range.
    The query time of our scheme is a very small constant. Therefore our scheme is
    much better than the scheme without integrating the K2-treap(w/o K2-treap). The
    average time consumption for our proposed scheme reduces as the query range’s
    area increases and is less than 10 seconds. 7 Related works To the best of our
    knowledge, existing works focus on either privacy-preserving max/min query [20,21,22]
    or range query [23,24,25,26], and have little work on privacy-preserving range-max
    queries in smart agriculture IoT. In the following, we introduce some related
    works that are close to our work. Some privacy-preserving max/min query schemes
    [20,21,22] have been proposed. Yao et al. [20] are the first to consider the privacy
    max/min query in two-tiered sensor networks. They use the prefix membership verification
    approach to encode sensor data. The proposed scheme can not only ensure the storage
    node to correctly process max/min queries over encoded data but also prevent the
    storage node from knowing the actual values. Since all sensors in this scheme
    share the same key, the data privacy could be leaked if a sensor is compromised.
    Thus, the security of this scheme is weak. Samanthula et al. [21] adopted the
    GM (Shafi Goldwasser, Silvio Micali) probabilistic encryption to protect data
    privacy even if a few sensors are compromised. Since every bit of the data collected
    by a sensor is encrypted into a vector whose length is equal to the domain size
    of the collected data, the network communication cost may become very large if
    the domain size of the collected data is large. Thus, this scheme is communication
    inefficient. Dai et al. [22] are the first to discuss privacy-preserving max/min
    query (PMQ) processing for the WSN-as-a-Service environment based on the secure
    multi-party computation. The communication cost of their PMQ scheme is lower than
    that of the schemes in [20, 21]. Nevertheless, all schemes above have multiple
    rounds of interactions between sensors during query processing. In addition, these
    schemes focus on obtaining the max/min value of all encrypted data in the whole
    region, and none of them consider the range query in a specific region. Some privacy-preserving
    range query schemes [23,24,25,26] have been proposed. The privacy-preserving range
    query is to obtain the data in a specific region while preserving the privacy
    of the query range and query result. Agrawal et al. [23] first presented the order-preserving
    encryption(OPE) technique that supports range queries over encrypted data. Boldyreva
    et al. [24] gave an efficient OPE implementation for a range query protocol. However,
    since the OPE technique essentially leaks the order information of the data, this
    scheme discloses the frequency of each different value in the dataset and is vulnerable
    to statistical attacks. Besides, this scheme cannot support the incremental update
    directly over ciphertexts. Lu [25] and Mahdikhani et al. [26] respectively proposed
    a new privacy-preserving range query scheme based on the homomorphic encryption
    technique. Both of the proposed schemes in [25, 26] focus on the scenario of the
    fog-enhanced IoT and can achieve range queries while preserving the privacy of
    IoT devices’ plaintext data and users’ query range. However, these schemes involve
    many interactions between the fog node and the IoT devices during the query process.
    Lu [25] reorganized range query by using range query expression, decomposition,
    and composition technique to achieve \\(O(\\sqrt {n})\\) communication. Mahdikhani
    et al. [26] proposed a novel range decomposition technique to compile the range
    query to achieve \\(O(\\log ^{3} n)\\) communication. Different from the above
    existing schemes, we focus on the range-max query, and propose an efficient and
    privacy-preserving range-max query scheme in fog-based smart agriculture IoT,
    which can obtain the max/min data of any specific region (including the whole
    region). To protect the security of the proposed scheme, we design data encryption
    and comparison technique based on BGN homomorphic encryption technique. The adoption
    of the BGN homomorphic encryption technique not only strengthens the security
    of the proposed scheme but also enables the proposed scheme to support the incremental
    updates over ciphertexts. Meanwhile, our range-max query scheme is a non-interactive
    scheme, so there are no interactions between the IoT devices and the fog node
    during the query process. 8 Conclusion In this paper, we have focused on the range-max
    query and proposed an efficient and privacy-preserving range-max query in fog-based
    smart agriculture IoT. Specifically, we first build the K2-treap, which is used
    for storing the data collected by agriculture IoT devices and support efficient
    range-max query and dynamic update of the data. Then, we design a data encryption
    and comparison algorithm based on BGN homomorphic encryption technique and present
    an efficient and privacy-preserving range-max query in the fog-based smart agriculture
    IoT, which can not only securely compare two data based on their ciphertexts but
    also support the incremental update directly over ciphertexts. Notably, our comparison
    technique and range-max queries are run by the fog node, so there are no interactions
    between the agricultural IoT devices and the fog node during the comparison and
    query. Finally, we conduct a detailed security analysis and performance evaluation.
    The results show that our proposed scheme can indeed protect the privacy of the
    agricultural IoT devices’ data and query results, and the experimental test results
    prove that our proposed scheme is efficient. In future work, we will continue
    to focus on the privacy protection of smart agricultural IoT applications and
    further explore some general and efficient privacy-preserving range query solutions.

  description: Feeding global population by 2050 requires 60% increase in the agricultural
    production. Agricultural transformation has a role to play for food security,
    poverty reduction and economic growth. However, sustainability and climate risk
    management are the challenges. The recent advancements in information technology
    (I. T) delivered smart devices, computing and sensor technologies. Application
    of those smart technologies have the potential to enable agricultural industry
    meets its productivity and sustainability challenge as well as solving indigenous
    agricultural problems of the developing nations. The geospatial data archives
    and real-time data from satellites, UAVs, RFIDs in combination with weather data,

    IoT and Machine Learning for Sustainable Development Chapter © 2023 1 Introduction
    The world’s population is expected to increase by one-third until 2050. Majority
    of those additional two billion people will be living in the developing countries.
    It is expected that more people will be living in large population centers and
    big cities. If the current trends continue then the agricultural production will
    have to increase by 60% to meet the demands for food and feed by 2050 (Faurès
    et al. 2013). Therefore, farming industry has become ever more important than
    before. In this scenario, agricultural transformation from conventional to technology
    based, can play a pivotal role to feed growing global population and provide the
    foundation for economic growth and poverty reduction. Challenge is to sustainably
    increase the food production to provide food as well as economic opportunities
    in both rural and urban communities (Ahmad and Farooq 2010). The progress in modern
    agricultural industry transformation can be traced back to decade of 1960s. The
    decadal progress in agriculture sector is provided in Table 1. In mid-1960s, the
    breakthrough in wheat and rice production in Asia brought up the famous Green
    Revolution that symbolized the process of using agricultural science to develop
    modern techniques for the developing world. It started from Mexico with the “quiet”
    wheat revolution and in 1960s and 1970s India, Pakistan and the Philippines received
    world attention for their agricultural progress. Over the past four decades in
    Developing Asia, the irrigated area has more than doubled – to 176 million hectares
    (mha). Fertilizer consumption has increased more than 30-fold and tractor in use
    has increased from 0.2 to 4.6 million that can be considered as a positive. What
    the world would have been like without the technological advances that have occurred,
    had the global grain yields of 1950s still prevailed in twenty-first Century we
    would have needed more than 1.8 billion ha additional land to equal the current
    global harvest (Borlaug 2002). Table 1 Decade wise agricultural technology innovation
    and advancement during the past 60 years Full size table An unprecedented systemic
    transformation is needed at a speed and scale to meet the current and future challenges
    of food security. The future agricultural systems need to be more productive,
    use inputs efficiently, have less variability and greater stability in their outputs.
    Moreover, the changing climate also needs the agricultural systems to be more
    resilient to, risks, shocks and long-term climate variability. The objective of
    reducing inputs and production costs as well as increasing yield and profitability
    can be addressed by changing the farming methods from conventional to conservation.
    However, more productive and more resilient agriculture can be practiced through
    a major shift in the way land, water, soil nutrients and genetic resources are
    managed for enhanced resource use efficiency. This transformation can also improve
    producers’ access to markets and a transformed agricultural system can reduce
    greenhouse gas emissions per unit of production and increase carbon sinks. The
    real transformation has been experienced by the advent of Information technology
    (I.T). It has brought up a revolution; the world is becoming ever more connected
    through it. The building blocks needed to make I.T based Agriculture a reality,
    has started to come together in the past few years. The estimated sale of I.T
    based agricultural gadgets has been increase manifolds as estimated by BI Intelligence
    (2015) and depicted in Fig. 1. We now have the ability to run complex computations
    at huge scales: a 100 times increase in computing power. The development of cloud
    computing resources and technologies can allow us to run calculations across hundreds
    of machines and turn that back into one simple actionable solution. A shift in
    progress of technology delivered smart devices those are smaller, faster and cheaper.
    While computing and sensor technologies are in use in the developed world for
    the last two decades, their application in agriculture has not been fully utilized.
    Smart digital services have the potential to help agricultural industry meet its
    productivity and sustainability challenges. Overall, technologies can be utilized
    effectively to solve indigenous agricultural problems of the developing nations.
    Fig. 1 Agricultural IoT devices marketed in various countries. (Estimates based
    on BI Intelligence, 2015) Full size image 2 Big Data in Agriculture The world
    is becoming digitized. We now can know more about the land that we farm than ever
    before. The availability of geospatial data archives and real-time data sets from
    satellites and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in combination with weather data,
    digitized soil data, and other real-time data streams coming from in-situ smart
    sensors can give us a better understanding of the interaction between crops, weather
    and soil that we would never had before, in ways that are cheaper and faster (Fig.
    2). All that bulk of data (Big Data) along with computational power is worthless
    unless we can turn it into a simple actionable solution that we can put in the
    hands of the farmer. Fig. 2 Conceptual I.T based agricultural data flow system
    Full size image Over the past years an increasing trend towards data-driven agriculture
    has been identified among farmers. According to an estimate provided by BI Intelligence
    (2016), It is estimated that 0.65 million data points are being generated every
    day from the agricultural farms that will reach up to 0.65 million. It is expected
    that more than 2.3 million data points will be generated by 2030 as many growers
    are pushing big data solutions to obtain qualitative and quantitative data to
    improve decisions regarding agricultural management and to increase their crop
    yields. Data in agriculture can be big in many ways. For example, in case of determining
    spatiotemporal variation of actual crop water use in irrigated areas at regional
    scales, a large number of Landsat scenes will cover the area every 16 days, where
    each Landsat scene occupy a storage space of approximately 1000 MB, and if approximately
    20 images were usable for each year of study and for every scene. It makes a total
    more than 500 images per year (for a typical regional scale study) and more than
    1500 images in a 3-year study. For that case, satellite-imagery (one of the input-information)
    only amounts to more than 15 terabytes, whereas the products generated during
    the course of scientific work (evapotranspiration in this case) are 10 times more
    than the original input data. Similarly, a flight of unmanned aerial vehicle covering
    agriculture area of one village (approx. 60 squares) for multispectral and thermal
    sensing generated 1.25 TB of raw data, that will be multiplied accordingly for
    additional flights during the growing season for pattern recognition, change detection
    and crop yield estimation through image processing and analytics. These projects
    are two examples of the work being carried out in digital and precision/climate-smart
    agriculture that is challenging the state of the art in computation, data storage
    and sharing. The climate-smart agriculture’s reliance on I.T. and digital data
    extends far beyond these examples. Data can also be big because of its lasting
    significance agro-ecological zones, soil survey maps, or the observation of other
    unique events. Also, data can be big because of descriptive challenges that may
    require contextual explanation and metadata. Because digital data can easily be
    shared and replicated and so re-combinable, they present tremendous reuse opportunities,
    accelerating investigations already under way and taking advantage of past investments
    in science. To encourage and enable reuse, data must be well preserved in workable
    formats. In some cases, data loss is economic loss (e.g. experiment have to be
    re-run), or it may also be an opportunity lost forever. Data are assets, and to
    achieve the greatest pay-off from these investments, researchers and institutions
    should document and implement data-management and data-sharing plans that address
    the full life cycle of data. The life cycle management of scientific data presents
    many challenges and opportunities. The challenges are great, but they can be solved
    by focused efforts and collaboration between funders, institutions and scientists.
    To facilitate data reuse, data disciplinary standards should be encouraged that
    will ultimately open the doors for development of disciplinary repositories for
    specific classes of data accessible and manageable through specialized software
    tools. The US National Institutes of Health (NIH) genetic sequence database (GenBank),
    the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) cropland database (CropScape), the US
    Geological Survey (USGS) land-cover and water database (GLOVIS) and the US National
    Virtual Observatory (USVO) are good examples of what is possible here. The repository
    of big data help to optimize inputs and increase crop yield thus helping farmers
    to get better agricultural produce. The historic trends of particular crop at
    every field can helpful in better predicting harvesting potentials. The evidence-based
    analysis of this big data can assist agricultural experts to predict and monetize
    crop yields while the farmers can get information regarding their crops and marketing
    places. 3 Data Analytics Management and Forecasting 3.1 Data Analytics The analytics
    of the big data can add value to lives of farmers and sustainability of the farms.
    Farmers cannot make sustainable farming choices based exclusively on large amounts
    of data collected at farm level. In addition to that, they also have limited time
    to digest large amount of data to find trends and/or irregularities. Therefore,
    it is difficult for them to gain actionable insights from all the crop sensors,
    drones and automated tractors. A farm management tool or software with the right
    blend of data and machine learning can help a farmer quickly decide which crops
    (down to the level of the plant) need insecticide, and then apply the chemicals
    spraying in a way that limits environmental impact and increase resource use efficiency.
    Moreover, it can also provide an opportunity to the banks and other monetary institutions
    to better assess the agricultural loans and risks associated with it. For example,
    in Pakistan, a pilot has been successfully tested to analyze the farmer’s ability
    to pay back loans to the banks. The data on land records; crop and soil health
    gathered by the multi spectral cameras on board UAV provided sufficient information
    on farmers’ pay back ability. The analytics of the data helped in improving farmers’
    income and productivity through provision of financial & technical services and
    adoption of good practices. Data analysis will be complex for more challenging
    problems of the agricultural system as well as at the individual farm level. However,
    with more involvement of deep learning and artificial intelligence in agriculture,
    it will gradually become possible to find the exact causes of low productivity
    and making real time decisions to take actions. 3.1.1 Real Time Data Analytics
    An alternative term Operational Intelligence (OI) is also used for Real-Time Data
    Analytics (RDA), a method that tracks the behavior of live systems, integrating
    streaming data with customer needs. RDA is implemented in situations requiring
    insight on a daily, frequent basis and enables farmers to analyze what’s happening
    on the farm and take immediate actions and see the results of their actions. RDA
    complements intelligent decision making by providing insight into new unstructured
    and semi-structured data in real-time. It handles Big Data in ways intelligent
    decision-making cannot. The RDA assisted streaming analytics can help agribusinesses
    make functioning decisions, adapt to the business environment and serve customers
    better when it really matters. RDA refers to a class of analytics that uses real-time
    data processing and data visualization into the processes and events while they
    occur. It is well equipped to address the integral challenges of big data by continuously
    monitoring and running query analysis against a range of high velocity and high
    volume big data sources. It associates and analyzes large volumes of (real time)
    streaming data arriving from diverse sources in order to link related events,
    discover problems, and reveal opportunities intelligently, that need immediate
    attention. 3.1.2 Intelligent Decision Making The intelligent decision making in
    agriculture is based on structured and static data collected from different sources
    to identify long-term trends in historical data of days, weeks, or even months
    long. Data generated by smart sensors collected at farms, on the field or during
    transportation offer a wealth of information about soil, seeds, livestock, crops,
    costs, farm equipment or the use of water and fertilizer. Data analytics in agriculture,
    can help farmers analyze real time data of weather, soil moisture, market trend
    or prices, GPS signals from farm machines and provide insights on how to optimize
    the resources to increase yield. It can further improve farm planning to make
    smarter decisions about the level of resources needed and their distribution strategy
    in order to prevent waste. Daily operations can be made more efficient with improved
    system performance. Additionally, the risk of natural mistakes can be reduced
    as management has a clear picture of what aspects are working successfully and
    those which can be classified as waste. The intelligent decision making has variety
    of uses in agricultural industry in particular as forecasted data, environmental
    impact, competitive advantage and waste reduction. The Agri-business Intelligence
    organizations have deployed many such dedicated analytic platforms including data
    accelerators, data appliances, and cloud based solutions to speed up the performance.
    These technologies may still not deliver true real-time data for informed decision-making,
    but they are enabling the update of data far more frequently and deliver answers
    to queries sooner. Taking everything into consideration, the intelligent decision
    making in smart farming leads to decreased expenditure and increased profits.
    The improved production through precision agriculture along with tailored marketing
    for sales using informed intelligence through smart farming to identify trends
    could lead to an extremely efficient agricultural business. 3.1.3 Tools for Big
    Agricultural Data Analysis As discussed earlier, the real-time data analytics
    depends on advanced technologies. All models used to process big data need to
    be fault-tolerant, scale with data, and have flexibility in the use of resources.
    High performance computing platforms that can provide real-time operation in seconds
    and milliseconds are of critical importance. The events need to be handled as
    they arrive for real-time insights, so high performance should characterize the
    chosen solution. Fresh streaming data can be pooled with archived data to support
    decision-making effectively and accurately. For example, the parallelism of Hadoop
    is excellent in batch processing of collected data but it has high latency. However,
    integration of a streaming data platform for continuous data analytics and streaming
    integration, real-time and interactive processing requirements presents a challenge
    that can be solved with further research in this domain. Data needs to be collected,
    processed, stored, and then finally operated for analytics including machine learning.
    In a typical streaming architecture data is gathered from several smart sensors
    that can be spread across a geographical area in an agricultural system. Then
    a distributed funnel mechanism is needed to put data into a set of available servers.
    Chen and Zhang (2014), reviewed technological solutions for data streams processing
    and open-source real-time processing systems, including Hadoop Online, S4, Storm,
    Flume, Spark streaming, Kafka, Scribe, HStreaming, Impala, and relevant messaging
    technologies. Despite the diversity the real-time systems are very similar. However,
    to come up with an efficient framework for gathering, processing and analyzing
    Big Data in agriculture in a near real-time or even better in a real-time perspective
    further research is required. 3.2 Data Management and Forecasting Every industry
    has their own experiences and challenges when it comes to dealing with big data
    and advanced analytics. Agriculture is no different, but progress is being made.
    An excellent example of using big data analytics to support sustainable farming
    practices is a research conducted by CIAT (International Center for Tropical Agriculture)
    in Colombia with assistance from Colombian government and CGIAR Research Program
    on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security. The CIAT research used data
    from FEDEARROZ (National Federation of Rice Growers in Colombia) to learn the
    exact causes of shrunken rice crop yields between 2007 and 2012. By analyzing
    past data and considering climate predictions, they made site-specific recommendations
    for crop variety and exact planting dates that are projected to increase yield
    to numbers that surpassed previous rice harvests. These site-specific interventions
    to reduce inputs and increase yields are referred to the term precision farming
    or interchangeably Precision Agriculture (PA). Real-time assessment of operational
    conditions (e.g. weather or disease alerts) and to carry out agile actions require
    reconfiguration features. These features usually include intelligent assistance
    in implementation, maintenance and use of the technology. For that, a PA grower
    must utilize information gathered from a series of smart devices and systems that
    communicate via the Internet to study and observe crop fields. These smart devices
    may be, temperature and soil moisture sensors, GPS farming apps and modules for
    automated machinery, satellite data, as well as drones used for aerial imaging.
    Where precision agriculture only takes in-field variability into account, the
    smart farming enhances PA by analyzing management tasks not only on location but
    also on data, enhanced by contextual and situational awareness, triggered by real-time
    events (Wolfert et al. 2014). 4 Precision Agriculture Lack of information at right
    time is causing massive losses to the farmers’ income and agricultural sustainability.
    The variability of soil from one field to the other, the variability in weather
    and crops that are planted, means the difference in optimal input for the field
    can vary three to four times from one field to the next, from 1 year to the other.
    So as a farmer, there is no way other than to put together these complex variables
    and come to a solution. Unfortunately, majority of our farmers stick back to the
    practices they know. They fall back to what is familiar or conventional and so
    majority of them barely having enough food to feed their families. Nowadays, farming
    practices are being supported by biotechnology, remote sensing, cloud computing
    and Internet-of-Things (IoT) (Li 2018) or Internet of Everything (IoE) (Dey et
    al. 2015). Internet of Everything refers to the intelligent connection of farmers/people,
    processes, data and things. IoE builds on top of the IoT, enhancing the power
    of the Internet to improve business outcomes. Rapid developments in the IoT and
    Cloud Computing are making smart farming possible. It is helpful in managing farms
    and crops database including farm location and size, cultivated area, inputs,
    time of sowing and harvesting as well as yield. Development of crop information
    management system can help the farmers to make quality and timely decisions. A
    system with a common repository that is able to collect, manage, analyze and disseminate
    the quality decision based on the data streams coming from different sources including,
    satellites, UAVs, in-situ sensors, and ambient weather conditions. Such big repository
    needs to be developed associated with high performance computing powers that can
    handle the flow of big data. Sustainably producing the right quantity and quality
    of food to take on food security challenge can be enabled by technologies. Invent
    of artificial intelligence and I.T have opened new horizons in the field of agriculture.
    Now work is being carried out to make real time agricultural robots and auto steering
    technologies to reduce labor requirements. Advanced precision agriculture technologies
    that deploy machine vision, big data analytics and advanced robotics could allow
    farmers to apply the optimal amount of inputs for each crop and assist with the
    management of livestock and aquaculture, thereby boosting yields and reducing
    water use and greenhouse gas emissions . To produce the highest yield with the
    least impact on the environment and use less water, resources and chemicals, while
    feeding our increasing population is a huge challenge. Now, new innovative technologies
    are taking on that challenge. These modern tools provide farmers with a collection
    of data about the status of the soil, insects, crops, livestock, water, and weather,
    etc. The ability to collect such detailed data has the potential to revolutionize
    agriculture and move farming toward more efficient and sustainable practices.
    The PA concept is well adopted in the various developed countries of the world.
    For example, it started in USA and Europe in early 1980s and early 1990s respectively.
    Figure 3 provides an insight of adoption rate of various technologies in Nebraska,
    USA. The spatial variability of soils was mapped and yield monitors were developed
    to map the spatial yield variability. The researchers further developed precision
    seed drills and variable rate applicators for spot application of seed, fertilizer
    and pesticides. Fig. 3 Precision agriculture technologies adoption in Nebraska,
    USA. (Source: University of Nebraska-Lincoln) Full size image The agricultural
    systems with on-board sensors were developed for automated fertilizer spreading
    and agro-chemical spraying. Use of Unmanned Arial Vehicle for agriculture (AgUAV)
    is also a hot topic of research and these are being used for crop monitoring,
    yield mapping and agrochemical spraying. Japanese are working extensively on sensor
    development, digital and hyper spectral image processing on-board UAVs. Information
    technologies platforms are in use for predictions of optimized local farming practices
    for the farmers. They provide information to the participant farmers on crop and
    soil health, weather conditions, socio-economic characteristics, labor and inputs
    availability and other related variables (Cheema et al. 2018). The flow of information
    is well described by Gebbers and Adamchuk (2010) and summarized in Fig. 4. Fig.
    4 Precision agriculture information flow for a cropping season. (Source: Gebbers
    and Adamchuk (2010)) Full size image Information technology can be used in providing
    a precision agriculture package by developing e-farm production system based on
    Precision Agriculture techniques, Crop and livestock management (RFIDs), precision
    irrigation applications, Crop water and pest/disease management, Wireless moisture
    sensing networks, Wireless communication in UAVs used for vegetation health detection,
    Rainfall monitoring system based on mobile communication data, Cloud services
    for knowledgebase on soils, nutrients, yields by making soil, nutrient and yield
    maps and disseminating through mobile networks and variable rate application based
    on GPS and GIS systems. 5 Communication and Information Sharing The innovations
    in Information Communication Technology (ICT) brought changes in many sectors
    yet agriculture and food systems have been slow to benefit from these innovations.
    There exists a great potential to harness the power of digital and I.T. It can
    promote timely as well as evidence-based decisions to improve the entire agriculture
    sector of the developing nations. Awareness and capacity building, better planning
    and community involvement is needed for agricultural breakthroughs. Since ICT
    particularly the IoT and related big data analytics provide electronic monitoring
    of crops, as well as related environmental, soil, fertilization, and irrigation
    conditions. Such a monitoring data can be used to identify which crop varieties
    will meet the challenge enhanced productivity at the particular farm anywhere
    in world. The plant phenomics (an area of biology concerned with the measurement
    of phenomes—the physical and biochemical traits of organisms—as they change in
    response to genetic mutation and environmental influences) is used to characterize
    the crop varieties. Therefore, association of monitoring and related data analysis
    results with specific crop varieties (i.e., plant genes and phenotypes) will revolutionize
    the way food is produced globally. Majority of the smart farming solutions are
    currently point based and limited to the use of specific IoT devices (e.g., a
    specific soil moisture sensor), with no further support for data analysis or sharing.
    To obtain a meaningful solution by using these IoT devices, a significant effort
    is required to integrate and correlate the data obtained from different IoT devices,
    e.g., data sets acquired from, a fertilizer sprayer (made by one manufacturer),
    soil moisture sensors (made by a different manufacturer). Development of such
    integrated model that permits a) effortless integration and use of any IoT sensor
    or device b) supports the scalable data analytics and c) allows plant biologists
    and farmers/growers to analyze and visualize plant performance data, will take
    us a step closer towards the ultimate goal (Jayaraman et al. 2016). Because use
    of internet and smartphones is enhancing rapidly. The data sharing apps with linkages
    to integrated platforms and models are future of farming and agricultural marketing.
    According to the 2015 report of International Telecommunications Union, 3.2 billion
    people were using the Internet across the globe of which 2 billion were from developing
    countries and similarly 92 of every 100 inhabitants in these countries have mobile
    phone subscriptions (ITU 2015). Therefore, the integration of I.T and agriculture
    can provide an opportunity to the farmers to attain maximum benefits by increasing
    yield, improving production, managing harvest and marketing the produce. However,
    more research is required to make customized solution and platforms to provide
    solutions tailored to specific farming scenarios in developing countries. The
    customized platforms for data sharing, manipulation and decision support are the
    key here. Where farmers can remotely monitor their equipment, crops livestock,
    stats about feeding and produce as well as market trends and information. That
    technology can even assist them to run prediction analysis for the crops, livestock
    and market. One of the biggest names in farming equipment John Deere is using
    integrated platform to connect its self-driving farm vehicles to the internet
    and display data of crop yields (BI 2015). All of these techniques are making
    data driven farming a reality. More and more data sources either in-situ, on-farm,
    low altitude or satellites can provide useful information to improve production,
    minimize inputs and environmental services from agriculture. 6 Conclusion The
    world is on the crossover of a technological revolution in the agriculture industry.
    The future of farming is in collecting and analyzing big data. Advanced analytics
    and precision agriculture will be the key to harness the technology and convert
    knowledge to farming practices in order to maximize efficiency. IoT based technologies
    with the involvement of modern instruments (sensors, computers, UAVs and satellites)
    have the potential to systematically change the traditional system of farming
    towards a low input, high efficiency and sustainable farming. These technologies
    will inevitably prove essential for taking on, what would likely be an insurmountable
    challenge, sustainably increasing our food supplies. The application of information
    technologies in agriculture wills not only help farmers to improve economy but
    also help the country to regulate overall economy and trade. Current wave of mobile
    technology proliferation in rural areas could provide opportunity to the farmers
    to improve agricultural productivity based on decisions made backed by better

    Location: Bangkok, Thailand SECTION I. Introduction This Flood is one of the major
    disasters that occurred in many areas of the country. Such incidents are frequent
    and more intense over time. Causing loss of life and property that cannot be estimated.
    The last flood Prachinburi. A flood disaster area four districts Nadi Kabin Buri.
    Srimahaphot district and the city. The latest water levels upstream of the Prachin
    Buri River. The Kabin Buri measuring 25 CM beyond the critical overflow its banks
    flooding Kabin prison. To transport inmates to a prison offense. Prison province
    and 142 of the 734 communities that address community water mill at about 1. 20
    meters from the research of Mr. Nuttaphong (2549) [1] studied the local district
    Prachantakham Prachinburi province, Thailand. Found to cause flooding in areas
    of heavy rainfall is contagious. The factors that cause the violent flood barrier
    are water. The settlement of the communities near the river topography. The slope
    of the terrain, soil, and soil drainage patterns. The cause of the flood. Because
    of the change, especially in areas prone areas. Plains, foothills and near waterways.
    The amount of water that cannot be stored in underground lots. Flows into the
    lower plains. The flood caused a sudden (Flash Flood) and flooded residential
    areas. An agricultural area in the lower plains Damage is huge Flooding is a natural
    phenomenon that cannot be avoided to prevent it. But you can find ways to reduce
    and mitigate the effects of violence and loss that will occur. By measures to
    prevent damage and flood management today. The last report on the situation in
    the flood floods most often. A news report is a document that is abstract. Notice
    the volume or area clear. According to the forecast, system modeling and hydrology,
    hydrogeology and mechanics. Has not presented a report to the management and to
    the public good. Information technology to help support decision making and early
    warning will help reduce the risk of flooding. A news report is a document that

    system helps flood warning more efficient and reduce losses that occur to people
    in areas at risk of flooding. SECTION II. Literature Reiew For a review of relevant
    literature and research. Factors relating to the surveillance system as a flood.
    Mr. Pongsak Chutikan and et., all. (2553) [2] The research on the flow rate of
    runoff. Or a maximum flow rate of runoff (peak flow discharge), formed by the
    precipitation Each is the result of an act shared between downpours indices moisture
    pre-existing areas or values. API (Antecedent Precipitation Index), for example.
    Downpours upstream in plenty of space on the water in the soil less. Runoff flowing
    into streams and rivers to rise not much contrast with more downpours over the
    upper area where the soil is saturated with water. The runoff flows into streams
    and rivers are high. Rising rapidly Similarly, the API will be the consequence
    of actions jointly. The rainfall Deposition over the area upstream of it. With
    the area upstream of the control system to absorb rainwater catchment and soil,
    including the type and depth of the soil layer. The factors that control the drainage.
    Soil into streams and rivers and conveying water to the lower area. Including
    topography and swampy ground. The idea or SCS (Soil Conservation Service) or NRCS
    (Natural Resources Conservation Services) today introduced the idea to create
    a mathematical model to estimate. The rate of flow of runoff caused by rainfall
    each. From the initial configuration of points. Factors affecting the absorption
    and soil drainage. The scores were all together as a CN or runoff curve number
    before the totals were adjusted to the API first start with rainfall that fell
    the previous 5 days, then the rainfall data. Falling on the date of valuation.
    Predicted flow rate. Variations of runoff in streams and rivers again. Resources
    Conservation Services) today introduced the idea to create a mathematical model
    to estimate. Mr. surathep thongjinda [3]. Research on flood early warning systems
    found that the Disaster Research Center. Forestry departments have established
    flood warning systems. The system is an automatic water level measurement system,
    which uses the pressure of a water holmium pressure gauge to detect the change
    of the pool. The changes of quenching water and water are calculated every fifteen
    minutes. Automatic alarm processing is carried out at the station. Or order to
    send alarm center Ho National Disaster Center Ho through the service provider
    of GPRS system. Name connection or communication between stations and yards If
    you don''t contact the central government. The water early warning system will
    also automatically process and make decisions about the alarm or give a signal
    to the villagers. You can give a warning. KomKris Narirat (2550) [4] studied the
    research system alarm flooding by using a microcontroller that Bangkok has prepared
    alarm flooding by the principle of alarm floods with a microcontroller. When installing
    a rainwater tank led by Vice rain with a device that measures rainfall. Keep an
    eye on the rain gauge to measure rainfall for the area to be alert with a microcontroller.
    The connection between the rainfall to support microcontroller is a master dealer
    will load the program has been installed, and the cable to the device, such as
    sirens and devices connected to the phone. The flood warning along with microcontrollers
    that will run when the rainfall falling on equipment rainwater. It has set the
    bar to wait for the water-downed. By tipping the beam tilt each time it sends
    a signal to the microcontroller. The control for the tilt of the beam from the
    rain by a microcontroller to count bobbing (beam tilt each time equal volume parts
    water to 0.3 mm), Therefore, when an experimental check comparison criterion in
    water at 1-hour flood warning machine which will measure the amount of water in
    a 3 level is moderate rain. Heavy rain. Very heavy rain the program will check
    the condition compared with 1 hour in time by the amount of water to moderate
    the light bulb 1 light meter water levels. The light bulb 2 be installed in water
    volume at most levels. The light bulb 3 to stick by comparison to make the alarm.
    Mr. Chuchock Wongravikul (2551) [5] studied the research. Forecasting and warning
    system that floods and water levels. The Mae Ping high flood embankment occurred
    several times in the city tremendous economic damage. This is one factor that
    causes severe damage. Not have the flood warnings ahead long enough to take action
    quickly and prevent outages. Data indicate that the water level in the flooded
    areas. They cannot forecast the level of water in the river will take place precisely
    in advance. The lack of understanding of the flood situation well enough. Therefore,
    forecasting and warning systems are effective, so there is an urgent need. As
    a precautionary measure, flooding the building had to take action. Which for many
    years could not catch for flooding to occur in the near future, forecasting and
    flood warning system in the city is one of the measures in the plan. This is a
    result of the warning; people have been known for more than 7 hours before it
    was discovered that there are several limitations in forecasting and flood warning
    systems that are currently available. The actions Planning for the severe floods.
    Only one Due to the weakness of the system involved in risk areas. Khanista Namee
    and et.al. (2019). Proposed the emergency platform that monitors the location
    of the AEDs and controls the opening/closing of the AED cabinets through the App.
    Also, the user can check the status of the AED through the App. This platform
    also specifies the exact location of the accident via the GPS system. Further
    statistical tests revealed that the location of the AED had 95% accuracy, can
    be controlled accurately 96%, with the average response time through the App 658
    ms. The results indicate that this platform supports EMS services more effective
    [6], [7]. SECTION III. The System Design The Flood surveillance and alert system
    an advance the IoT development of support systems for measurement and analysis
    of the flood warning. The process of deciding on the alert system is designed
    to share information on the parameters set by the sensor. Installed in the area

    the more intense the use of technology is, agriculture turns new security risks,
    which may affect both crop development and the commodities market. A security
    breach may irreversibly compromise a crop and data eavesdropping may compromise
    price and contracts exposing sensitive data such crop quality, development or
    management. This paper discusses security challenges and technologies for the
    application of IoT in agriculture and indicates that one of the most relevant
    challenges to be handled in SWAMP project is dealing with the multitude of behaviors
    from IoT application and what would be considered as normal and what would be
    considered as a threat. Published in: 2018 48th Annual IEEE/IFIP International

    Luxembourg, Luxembourg SECTION I. Introduction Food security calls for the intensive
    use of irrigation in agriculture at the same time that water is increasingly becoming
    a precious and scarce asset for mankind. Irrigation for agriculture is the most
    significant consumer of freshwater in the world, amounting to 70% of freshwater
    [5]. In an attempt to avoid loss of productivity by under-irrigation, farmers
    feed more water than is needed and as a result not only productivity is challenged
    but also water and energy is wasted. The Internet of Things (IoT) [2] and other
    related technologies can be used for that purpose, but it faces several challenges
    such as the lack of easy-to-use software tools and platforms, communication constraints
    in rural areas and sensor integration issues. Such technological features in agriculture
    also bring severe security risks, since some machines have autonomous systems
    and data generated by IoT devices could expose critical aspects of the production
    or even they may be manipulated to support wrong conclusions about crop development.
    The SWAMP1 project develops IoT based methods and approaches for smart water management
    in precision irrigation domain and to pilot the approaches in four places, two
    pilots in Europe (Italy and Spain) and two pilots in Brazil. The same underlying
    SWAMP platform can be customized to different pilots considering different countries,
    climate, soil, and crops. The SWAMP architecture may be implemented in a range
    of deployment configurations involving the use of smart algorithms and analytics
    in the cloud, fog-based smart decisions located on the farm premises and possibly
    mobile fog nodes acting in the field (e.g., drones or in the central pivot irrigation
    mechanisms). The four SWAMP pilots are based on the similar technical solutions
    and deal with different crops and have different primary goals. CBEC Pilot (Bologna/Italy):
    the main objective of the Consorzio di Bonifica Emilia Centrale (CBEC) pilot is
    optimizing water distribution to the farms. Intercrop Pilot (Cartagena/Spain):
    Intercrop Iberica addresses several challenges since production is in a dry area,
    and a considerable amount of water comes from a desalination plant. The primary
    goal for Intercrop is using water more rationally. Guaspari Pilot (Espirito Santo
    do Pinhal/Brazil): The Guaspari Winery transfers the wine grape harvesting to
    the winter season (June-August) using irrigation techniques. The main goal for
    Guaspari is improving wine quality. MATOPIBA Pilot (Barreiras/Brazil): The Rio
    das Pedras Farm is located in the MATOPIBA region, and irrigation is mostly performed
    by center pivots. This main pilot goal is to implement and evaluate a smart irrigation
    system based on Variable Rate Irrigation (VRI) for center pivots in soybean production
    and save energy used in irrigation. SECTION II. Iot in Precision Irrigation for
    Agriculture The SWAMP proj ect is being built upon existing research such as FIW
    ARE that is EU-funded IoT solution library used for smart applications [8] and
    precision irrigation [7]. SWAMP shares several features with other precision irrigation
    initiatives such as FIGARO project [4] that aims at increasing water productivity
    and improving irrigation practices through a cost-effective precision irrigation
    management platform not directly involving IoT. SWAMP intends to use IoT combined
    with cloud-based services and big data analytics and conduct experiments in real
    settings. Brewster et al. discuss the deployment of large-scale pilots for IoT
    in agriculture and describe technologies that might be present in some agrifood
    domains [3]. SECTION III. Security Challenges for Iot in Agriculture In general,
    IoT has many security requirements, such as data privacy, confidentiality and
    integrity, authentication, authorization and accounting, and availability of services
    [6]. The security mechanisms have to be energy efficient, since many IoT devices
    are limited in power, processing, and memory resources. There is no unified vision
    on security in the IoT [1] [6], but many security solutions are being proposed
    and may be used in smart agriculture and irrigation. Water is a critical resource
    and an attacker may take control of the system and a whole crop would be decimated,
    due to lack or excess of irrigation. A DoS (Denial of Service) attack in the sensors,
    irrigation actuators or in the distribution system may affect the availability
    of the system. Changes in the values of some sensors are also a threat that may
    cause systems or decision makers to take wrong actions and compromise months of
    efforts and production goals. If an attacker takes control of the actuators, the
    irrigation and water distribution is compromised, wrongly irrigating some crop.
    Using eavesdropping, intruders may have access to private data about the farm
    and crop yield information and even manipulate the commodity markets, which is
    even a more extensive threat. Autonomous vehicles, such as drones and tractors,
    used for collecting images and crop monitoring, must also be secured. An unauthorized
    node in the network (sensor node or drone) may send false information about the
    crop. A drone or sensor node performing the Sybil attack could send fake images
    and false measurements, leading to the incorrect interpretation of the actual
    soil conditions, incorrect calculation of the NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation
    Index), and the like. The SWAMP architecture must deal with the control of data
    by the farmers or producers, ensuring that each owner controls their data and
    decides the access control to the data and the services. The distribution of water
    between users is very sensitive issue also addressed by SWAMP. Trust, privacy
    and security must be the basis of information exchange. Data anonymization is
    another helpful technique for data governance and even some regulation and legal
    frameworks for agriculture are being discussed by governments. There are also
    many innovative proposals in the literature for security solution in various domains
    of IoT [7] [8], including 6LoWPAN networks. SDN (Software Defined Networking)
    architecture for IoT allows administrators to have a centralized view of the IoT
    system [8] and to implement security services. A disruptive technology in security
    is blockchain, which will have great importance in the security of IoT [7]. One
    possible application is in the supply chain and lifecycle of an IoT device. For
    instance, it is possible to track all the attributes, relationships and events
    related to a device. The use of smart contracts is also a promising mechanism
    to be used in new methods for authentication, authorization, and privacy of IoT
    devices [6]. One of the most relevant security challenges for IoT in agriculture
    is not only the integration of technologies but also to understand and correlate
    the expected sequence of events and behavior of agriculture applications. SWAMP
    has a multitude of characteristics to be evaluated and a baseline must be created
    to promote security effectiveness. Regardless of the data acquisition rate, or
    the number of installed sensors, the system will probably have a partial view
    of the environment. As a consequence, applications may create a partial profile
    of the crop and related environment, which does not necessarily correspond to
    that crop. Therefore, inadvertent use of a given profile may cause harm to a crop,
    and security mechanisms should take this into account when producing their results.
    The SWAMP project deals with many of these challenges and requirements. The platform
    must provide efficient authentication, authorization and access control mechanisms.
    It is important to keep data apart from farms in our pilots. The access to the
    platform must be allowed only for identified and authorized users, using FIWARE
    security generic enablers (GE) and the OAuth 2.0 protocol. The confidentiality
    of the data must be provided using state of the practice cryptography. Wireless
    and wired communications must use existing security features of the underlying
    technology and existing security protocols. The availability of the platform must
    be provided even in case of Internet disconnections using local components (fog
    computing) to keep the platform running properly. SECTION IV. Conclusion SWAMP
    intends to use IoT to improve the use of water resources in heterogeneous pilots,
    each one with its own characteristics and challenges. The adoption of an open-source
    platform as FIWARE as the basis of SWAMP platform development has advantages but
    the use of IoT in agriculture also brings several security challenges, since a
    multitude of threats may cause severe and irreversible damages to the crop. In
    order to protect IoT devices and cloud systems, the SWAMP platform should not
    only deal with device security, data confidentiality and authentication mechanisms,
    but also with mechanisms to avoid fake data. The latter may result in misunderstandings
    about crops or may allow eavesdropping that may cause manipulation of commodity
    markets. Authors References Citations Keywords Metrics Footnotes More Like This

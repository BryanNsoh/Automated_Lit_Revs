  description: Adopting and developing sustainable precision irrigation systems allows
    for improving productivity, reducing water and energy losses in agricultural fields.
    This paper deals with the development and real-time implementation of a smart
    precision irrigation system (SPIS). The proposed system combines two irrigation
    approaches, processed by a feedback fuzzy logic (FL) controller, and long-range
    data transmission and monitoring via the LoRa protocol. The combined approaches
    not only enhance overall performance but also address several limitations commonly
    associated with existing approaches. The proposed system uses the collected data
    from the sensors unit to provide the optimal irrigation decision and communicates
    it with the operator (farmer) via a developed IoT platform. Data from soil moisture,
    ambient temperature, solar irradiance, and rainfall sensors are processed through
    the FL controller to adjust the irrigation times. The inputs and outputs are fuzzified
    by trapezoidal and triangular membership functions. Mamdani's fuzzy inference
    is used to control the system through a set of linguistic control rules for a
    more accurate decision for each scenario. The field experimentation of the developed
    SPIS in the eastern region of Morocco shows high efficiency and reliability by
    saving water and energy compared to traditional irrigation control. The proposed
    system, with remote data monitoring, promotes better management of irrigation,
    water, and energy consumption, and it is suitable to be mounted with any type
    of irrigation installation in the field, without extensive modifications.

    saving 1. Introduction Agriculture is considered a key issue of national development
    due to the important economic, social, and territorial stakes of this sector (Knox
    et al., 2012). In Morocco, agriculture is the first contributor to the gross domestic
    product (GDP) with a variation of 11 % to 18 %, which is mainly influenced by
    climatic conditions. Moreover, Moroccan agriculture employs nearly half of the
    active population and provides 23 % of the nation''s exports1. In 2022–2023, water
    scarcity in Morocco is considered a major concern as water reserves have been
    reduced by 59 %, which exposes them to spatial and temporal irregularity issues.
    Fig. 1 (a) shows the rainfall deficit percentage and Fig. 1 (b) shows the drought
    index of January 2023 in Moroccan regions2. Given the enormous evolution of irrigated
    agricultural areas that consume huge amounts of water, the unpredictability of
    rainfall may lead to increasing and deepening the problem of water availability
    and the failure to meet the irrigation needs of crops, resulting in rising drought
    areas and a decline in agricultural productivity. One of the factors contributing
    to this is the use of permanent alimentation solenoids to activate irrigation
    systems and low performance irrigation approaches (Avşar et al., 2018, Le et al.,
    2020). These solenoids require a continuous power supply, leading to increased
    energy demands. The reliance on such solenoids is prevalent in various agricultural
    processes, including irrigation systems, crop harvesting machinery, and automated
    greenhouse controls. The constant power requirements of these solenoids contribute
    significantly to the overall energy consumption in the agricultural sector, further
    straining the already limited resources. Addressing this issue and exploring alternative
    energy-efficient solutions could mitigate the environmental impact and reduce
    the sector''s overall energy consumption. Download : Download high-res image (466KB)

    (%), (b) The drought index of January 2023 of Morocco. For the agricultural areas
    of eastern Morocco, irrigation water and energy losses are generally caused by
    two factors: the first factor is the manual control of the pump and valves in
    the pressurised irrigation system. According to Hamami and Nassereddine, 2020,
    Xie et al., 2022, the inefficiency of these irrigation systems extends beyond
    Morocco and has been observed in other regions as well. The studies highlight
    that these traditional irrigation systems, which rely on manual pump activation,
    contribute to significant losses in irrigation water and energy. These findings
    suggest that the low efficiency of such systems is not limited to a specific geographical
    area but is a widespread issue that affects multiple agricultural regions (Kumar
    et al., 2023). In those cases, farmers use their prior knowledge of crop response,
    or by observing leaf stress, to determine the duration of irrigation. This technique
    cannot be relied upon since it does not reflect the actual water needs of the
    plants, which are related to the growth stage and weather conditions (Jaafar et
    al., 2021). On the other hand, the second factor is the losses due to the process
    in which irrigation water is released into the atmosphere as vapor, caused mainly
    by the high temperature and solar irradiance rates. This factor can be solved
    by using drip irrigation methods, but it is also necessary to adopt advanced control
    techniques. The development and design of smart precision irrigation systems and
    mechanisms with the use of IoT technologies for the visualization and monitoring
    of different parameters of agriculture and irrigation is the key solution to managing
    irrigation water resources efficiently and sustainably by delivering the exact
    amount of water required by the crop (Capraro Fuentes et al., 2018). In addition,
    optimizing the energy supplied to operate the various actuators (Qaisar et al.,
    2021, Mellit et al., 2021). Irrigation systems are classified into two categories
    according to their control, open-loop and closed-loop control systems. Open-loop
    control, also called no-feedback control, is a type of controller that generates
    decisions based on the current state, i.e., it has no feedback to determine if
    the assessed input has achieved the desired objective, in our case satisfying
    the crop''s water needs with precision while considering climatic-soil conditions
    (Navarro-Hellín et al., 2016). Therefore, an open-loop irrigation system cannot
    be reliably used to deal with the challenges of precision irrigation. Programmable
    irrigation controller, also called irrigation timers are among the systems based
    on this control technique. The scheduling of the period and duration of the irrigation
    remains constant without knowing the real needs of irrigation in the crop. Closed-loop
    control systems are the most efficient and robust in terms of decision support
    and allow for precision irrigation (Bwambale et al., 2022). The action depends
    on the output provided by the system; the input varies according to the output,
    which produces a more accurate decision. The feedback loop also allows for automatic
    adjustments to be made in real time, which improve the accuracy, stability and
    performance of irrigation decisions. Sensor units are used to provide this feedback
    to the processing unit. According to agriculture experts and scientific research,
    three approaches are distinguished (Abioye et al., 2020, Wang et al., 2020). The
    first approach is based on the measurement of soil moisture, which indicates the
    amounts of water consumed and absorbed by the crop during a period, and then decides
    on the scheduling of future irrigation times by setting a percentage of soil moisture,
    so the irrigation system works until it reaches the set value of moisture (Soulis
    et al., 2015). An intelligent urban irrigation system is discussed in (Mason et
    al., 2019) aiming at decreasing water use without reducing crop yield. The system
    includes a wireless soil moisture sensor network and controllable valves and tested
    in nine climatic regions of the contiguous United States. Tomatoes are chosen
    due to their sensitivity to water stress. The second approach is to control irrigation
    according to the evolution of the meteorological conditions (Kool et al., 2014).
    The measurement of environmental variables in real time such as: air temperature
    and humidity, solar irradiance and wind speed allows estimating the reference
    evapotranspiration level (ET0) (Chiew et al., 1995), which indicates the water
    losses suffered by the plant and the soil (J. Doorenbos et al., 1976). Weather
    stations or IoT-based sensor networks are used to provide such information. In
    (González-Briones et al., 2018), a monitoring system able to collect various data
    on its environment, by sensing temperature, solar irradiance, pH, humidity, and
    wind speed is presented. The objective of this research is to build virtual organizations
    of agents based on several master and slave nodes that are connected to ensure
    data exchange from sensors while monitoring the crops. The development of a platform
    (IoT) with a fibrous capillary irrigation system based on the climatic demand
    estimated by the weather condition was reported by (Abd Rahman et al., 2019).
    The experiment has been conducted using a Choy sum plant as a test crop in a greenhouse.
    Demand tracking, management of the irrigation system, and the use of weather information
    allowed for near real-time estimation of the crop''s water requirements, which
    also allowed the monitoring of the progress of water consumption by the plants.
    The last approach is the survey of the plant evolution parameters, such crop water
    stress index (CWSI), which determine the water needs of the plant, through the
    measurement of canopy temperature. Most irrigation systems are based on simple
    control techniques and algorithms (Davis, and Dukes, 2010; Singh et al., 2023),
    containing a single input or a threshold value to be set by the operator to decide
    on starting or ending the irrigation. The reliability and efficiency of those
    controls’ techniques are limited and unable to reliably schedule irrigation since
    precision irrigation involves the evaluation and processing of multiple inputs.
    Fuzzy logic (FL) is one of the intelligent control techniques that allow to manipulation
    of multiple input variables while taking account of the output action. So, it
    is more suitable for non-linear systems due to its flexibility in data processing
    and it is very effective for decision-making problems that require precision (Zadeh,
    1999). The operation of fuzzy logic has been thoroughly tested in a diverse and
    challenging field (Yahyaoui et al., 2017). It is structured with three main modules,
    a fuzzification module, an inference engine, and a defuzzification module. Mamdani
    and Sugeno are the two popular approaches in FL (Omomule et al., 2020, Shafaei
    et al., 2017), each with its own distinct characteristics. The key difference
    lies in how they handle the fuzzy rule’s consequences. In Mamdani-FL, the output
    membership function is a fuzzy set representing the degree of membership of the
    output variable. This allows for linguistic descriptions, where the output can
    be interpreted in terms of linguistic terms (Pourjavad et al., 2019). On the other
    hand, Sugeno-FL employs a more mathematical approach, where the output is represented
    as a crisp value or a mathematical function of the input variables. This enables
    precise numerical calculations and facilitates mathematical modelling. The advantage
    of the Mamdani-FL lies in its ability to incorporate linguistic rules and provide
    interpretable outputs. By using linguistic terms, the system''s behaviour becomes
    more understandable and intuitive to humans, making it suitable for applications
    where transparency and explainability are crucial. It allows experts to easily
    define rules using their domain knowledge and linguistic terms, making it a powerful
    tool in decision-making processes (Hamam et al., 2008). Additionally, Mamdani-FL
    supports a wide range of inference methods and can handle complex and nonlinear
    systems effectively. While Sugeno-FL has its own advantages, such as its computational
    efficiency and ability to handle mathematical modelling, the interpretability
    and linguistic-based nature of Mamdani-FL make it a preferred choice in agriculture
    applications (Urbieta Parrazales et al., 2021). A FL-based irrigation controller
    is designed and integrated into a field in India, to perform multi-criteria decision-making,
    this allows to select of the most efficient and adequate irrigation sub-system
    (Yilmaz and Harmancioglu et al., 2010). Another application of FL has been reported
    in (Krishnan et al., 2020). The objective is to automatically control the irrigation
    through the measurement of soil moisture to decide the necessary flow for irrigation.
    Six fuzzy rules have been implemented. DC motor is activated in cases where the
    soil moisture value is between medium and very low values, otherwise the contrary.
    The modelling and simulation of a fuzzy irrigation system have been presented
    in (Mushtaq et al., 2016). The approach is based on the calculation of ET by a
    fuzzy inference system. The input variables are temperature, humidity, wind, and
    solar radiation. The obtained results show the effectiveness of the fuzzy system
    in accurately determining and compensating the water loss due to ET. Another work
    (Kurniawan et al., 2017) presented the combination of a prediction algorithm and
    fuzzy control. The combination of fertilization and irrigation precisely to reduces
    the amount of irrigation water and the waste of chemical fertilizers. This results
    in further saving and reducing production costs and improving agricultural efficiency.
    In our previous work (Benzaouia et al., 2021) we developed an intelligent irrigation
    system based on FL controller for the automatic watering of agricultural areas
    (Oriental Morocco). The simulation results proved that the irrigation system allows
    to keep the soil moisture measurements higher than the value specified by the
    user and eliminates the under-irrigation risk. In the presented research works,
    the utilization of FL is primarily focused on simple applications. These applications
    involve employing fuzzy sets and membership functions to handle vague or uncertain
    data and make decisions based on fuzzy reasoning. Moreover, a noteworthy aspect
    of these works is the use of minimal control rules, implying that the number of
    rules employed in the fuzzy logic systems is kept to a minimum. In the realm of
    modern field management, it is crucial not only to adopt advanced control systems
    but also to incorporate communication IoT protocols to enable seamless data transmission
    and enhanced control. The integration of IoT offers numerous benefits, including
    real-time data acquisition, remote monitoring, and improved decision-making capabilities.
    Various communication technologies, such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, and others,
    can be utilized to establish reliable connections in field management applications.
    Table 1 provides a summary of these technologies and their application for irrigation
    monitoring, outlining their respective ranges and power consumption. The common
    characteristic among these technologies is their low data transmission range.
    However, in the case of large agricultural areas, it becomes necessary to employ
    technologies that can cover vast distances with improved sending capabilities
    which makes them very limited. LoRa technology stands out as one of the promising
    solutions that has proven its effectiveness in various industrial applications
    (Kaur et al., 2022), additionally, in fields such as telemedicine (Ayat et al.,
    2023). It offers several advantages for IoT applications, its long-range capability
    allows for communication over large distances, while its low power consumption
    ensures minimizing energy consumption. The cost-effectiveness of LoRa, coupled
    with its scalability and secure communication features, also makes it suitable
    for large-scale deployments. The flexibility of LoRa enables its use in diverse
    environments, and its open standard promotes interoperability. Table 1. IoT technologies

    smart precision irrigation system with a combined weather-soil approach is proposed
    and designed, to efficiently schedule the irrigation of apple trees in fields
    located in the eastern region of Morocco. Soil moisture, ambient temperature,
    solar irradiance, and rainfall are the inputs of the FL controller. They are sensed
    through different sensors, and subsequently transmitted to apply the well-designed
    fuzzy rules for irrigation control, while the output is the duration and timing
    of irrigation which depends on the crop requirements in the field. This allows
    for optimizing the soil water content, enhancing plant health and product quality.
    The system also includes a long-range LoRa communication module for wireless transmission
    and a developed IoT platform for visualization and monitoring to enhance the mentioned
    drawbacks of discussed IoT techniques in irrigation. The techno-economic study
    between the proposed system in the literature and the one available on the commercial
    market, proved the reliability of the proposed SPIS to manage the irrigation process
    in a precise and intelligent manner with low-cost installation. This is the first
    research study reported on the design of an intelligent precision irrigation system
    adapted to the eastern climate of Morocco. The main contributions of the paper
    can be summarized as follows: • The design of an automated intelligent irrigation
    controller based on FL inference that evolves in real-time the weather-soil monitoring
    approach to decide the optimal irrigation time and impulse solenoid-valve opening.
    The system is highly efficient and tested in an agricultural field under real
    scenarios. • The development of a real-time visualization and monitoring IoT platform
    for irrigation and field data such as system status, soil moisture, air humidity,
    ambient temperature, solar irradiance, irrigation time, energy, water consumption,
    etc. • Provide a reliable and efficient irrigation system at a low cost. The article
    is organized as follows, Section 2 presents the design and control of the proposed
    irrigation system. Section 3 describes the operating steps of the system. Section
    4 discusses the software and hardware implementation. The experimental performance
    evaluation and the techno-economic study are given in Section 5. Conclusion and
    future improvement are reported in the last Section 6. 2. Design and control of
    the proposed irrigation system The structure of the proposed smart precision irrigation
    system based on an effective strategy that combines both weather and soil approaches
    is given in Fig. 2. It consists of five essential sub-systems: (1) the sensors
    unit, (2) the controller unit, (3) the irrigation unit, (4) the IoT communication
    unit, and finally (5) the power unit. A detailed description of the methodology

    The structure of the smart precision irrigation system. 2.1. Location and specification
    of the study field An agricultural field situated around the eastern region of
    Morocco has been selected to carry out the experimentation of the developed irrigation
    system (See Fig. 3). The location and global positioning are a latitude of 34.811835
    and a longitude of −1.967141 (34°48′42.6″N 1°58′01.7″W). Download : Download high-res
    image (271KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Geographical view of
    the field of experimentation. The field is divided into three areas (A), (B) and
    (C). The focus is only on the A and B zones, the irrigation system in the first
    zone (A) is controlled by the proposed smart precision irrigation system and the
    second zone (B) temporised controller is used. Note that the area A and B are
    about 1300 m2 for each and contain about 140 apple trees, with an irrigated surface
    approximately 100 m2. The experiment region exhibits a unique semi-arid climate
    influenced by its geographical location and topography. Situated in the eastern
    part of the country, this region experiences distinct climatic conditions that
    have significant implications for agriculture and socio-economic activities. The
    climate can be classified as Mediterranean with semi-arid characteristics. It
    is characterized by hot and dry summers with limited rainfall and mild, wet winters.
    The region is known for its high temperatures during the summer months, often
    exceeding 40 °C (104°F). Additionally, the area experiences high ET rates due
    to the combination of high temperatures and limited rainfall, resulting in the
    loss of water from both the soil and vegetation. Precipitation is moderate, with
    most rainfall occurring between October and April. However, there is considerable
    variability in precipitation patterns, leading to occasional drought conditions.
    The unique semi-arid climate of the region plays a crucial role in shaping agricultural
    practices, water resource management, and overall livelihoods in the area. 2.2.
    Sensors unit The sensors unit consists of specific field sensors for soil moisture
    measurement, and climatic sensors for measuring ambient temperature, relative
    air humidity, solar irradiance, and rainfall. All the used sensors are calibrated
    to prevent any drift that could be generated during their operation. 2.2.1. Soil
    moisture sensing Soil moisture information is extremely important for the control
    and scheduling of irrigation periods. It allows to identify the characteristics
    of diffusion or storage of water in a defined soil, which is usually influenced
    by its composition and texture (sandy, clayey and silty soil). There are two main
    techniques for determining soil moisture, the direct method and the indirect method.
    The direct method, known as gravimetric, consists of drying a soil sample and
    then determining the weight of the water contained in the sample. This method
    is not adapted to real-time applications and remains expensive. Indirect methods
    consist in measuring the electrical conductivity or the dielectric permittivity
    of the soil and then converted to volumetric soil water content. For this application,
    a UM-MS-10 sensor is selected. This sensor is dedicated to precision irrigation
    applications while offering very accurate measurements, and a high sensitivity
    to amounts of water applied to the soil with a low error range (about ± 2 % and
    ± 4 % for a water content between 0 and 53 % and 53–100 % respectively), in addition
    to the possibility of calibration for specific soils. Determining the number of
    soil moisture sensors is based on several factors, including the size and nature
    of the area being monitored, the type of crops, the depth of the root zone, the
    soil properties, and the way that the area is exposed to weather variations. In
    our research focused on apple trees, a case study to examine soil moisture levels
    in zone A has been conducted firstly. Multiple sensors have been strategically
    placed at different locations within the zone to capture comprehensive data. The
    analysis revealed consistently low measurement errors, attributable to the soil''s
    homogeneity and absence of geographical irregularities. Consequently, a single
    sensor has been selected and positioned at a depth of 0.3 m. This depth is justified
    based on the relevant findings reported in our previous research (Benzaouia et
    al., 2021). To ensure the generalizability of our results across the entire field,
    further investigations are planned. These subsequent examinations will involve
    subdividing the field into smaller zones, allowing for the optimization of sensor
    placement, and determining the minimum number of sensors required for accurate
    soil moisture assessments. This approach enhances the scientific rigor of the
    study and provides valuable insights into the spatial variability of soil moisture.
    2.2.2. Ambient temperature sensing As temperatures increase toward limit values,
    the plants'' ET rates increase and the water balance of the soil decreases, therefore
    the scheduling of irrigation according to temperature variations is also crucial.
    The DHT-11 sensor is a reliable sensor for measuring ambient temperature and relative
    humidity, requiring no external calibration, and able to measure temperatures
    from −40 to + 125 °C with an accuracy of ± 0.5 °C and relative humidity ranges
    from 0 to 100 % with an accuracy of ± 2 %. 2.2.3. Solar irradiance sensing Solar
    irradiance is a source of energy that comes from a thermal process, which also
    contributes to the evaporation process. So, it is important to schedule irrigation
    during a period of minimal solar irradiance. Several devices are available to
    measure and quantify the intensity of solar irradiance, including pyrometer, LDR,
    photoristor and others. However, most of them are expensive and usually require
    an adapter to exploit the collected data. For economic and technical reasons,
    a BH1750 sensor has been selected to estimate solar irradiance intensity. It allows
    a measurement range from 1 lx to 100.000 lx, with an error of ± 3 % for low and
    high ranges, additionally to its robustness against IR radiation (Very small effect
    of IR radiation). 2.2.4. Rainfall sensing To save the water and energy consumption
    of the proposed irrigation system in the agricultural field in case of precipitation,
    a rain sensor or rain switch is integrated, allowing the detection of rainfall.
    Hence, if the feedback received from the sensor indicates the availability of
    high rates of rainfall, the system is turned off and the irrigation periods are
    rescheduled by referring to fuzzy logic rules. 2.3. Controller unit The controller
    is held responsible for intelligent data processing for irrigation scheduling,
    and the generation of the output control signal, namely the duration, time, and
    period of irrigation unit opening and activation which is decided by FL programmed
    and implemented in ATmega2560 microcontroller. In addition, this unit is responsible
    for receiving and transmitting time-series data from the sensor’s unit to the
    developed visualization and monitoring platform. 2.3.1. Mathematical modeling
    The proposed FL controller is composed of three key components, namely the fuzzification
    module, the inference engine, and the defuzzification module, as illustrated in
    Fig. 4. The system operates by developing a universe of discourse ( ) that entails
    a membership function and defining an interval of ( ) represented by . In this
    context, is characterized as a membership function that comprises a set of ordered
    pairs of elements and the probability that e belongs to ( ), as described by Pazouki
    et al., 2021. Download : Download high-res image (171KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 4. Flow-chart of FL inference-based irrigation controller. The system
    requires three input parameters, namely soil moisture (SM), temperature (T), and
    solar irradiance (SR). Each of these parameters comprises three membership functions
    that are identified by a fuzzy subset of ( ). Specifically, variable represents
    soil moisture, variable represents temperature, and variable represents solar
    irradiance. The degree to which a given value of belongs to variables , , and
    is expressed by the membership functions , and . Equations (2), (3) respectively
    provide the fuzzy intersection and union set for the three variables. The purpose
    of the fuzzification step is to transform a digital input obtained from a sensor
    into a linguistic variable by means of membership functions. A membership function
    can be defined as a function that specifies the degree of membership of a numerical
    input to a linguistic variable. In this context, the membership function employed
    regulates a variety of parameters, including fluctuations in soil moisture, temperature,
    and solar irradiance. The proposed irrigation system commonly employs triangular
    and trapezoidal membership functions to make appropriate decisions. Equations
    (4), (5) depict the triangular and trapezoidal shapes, respectively, for a three-value
    fuzzification system. Fig. 5 illustrates the membership functions for both the
    inputs and outputs of the FL controller. (2) (3) (4) (5) Download : Download high-res

    functions. The fuzzy inference process involves the interpretation of input values
    gathered from sensors, which are then utilized to determine output values based
    on sets of rules. To accomplish this, a set of if-then rules has been formulated
    to operate with the membership functions of each input. The literature describes
    two types of fuzzy inference systems that can be implemented: Mamdani type and
    Sugano type. The Mamdani type has been selected for the proposed irrigation system
    because it is well-suited for expert system applications. In each given scenario,
    the output of the controller is represented by the irrigation duration, time and
    periods which varies in accordance with the fuzzy rules grouped in Table 2, Table
    3, and Table 4. Table 2. Rules of the output (duration of irrigation in min) for

    serves as the final step. After fuzzification, the rules are applied to generate
    a fuzzy output which is subsequently transformed into a scalar quantity. The selection
    of the centroid defuzzification method has been based on its precision in producing
    reliable outputs. Equation (6) expresses the defuzzified output ( ). (6) 2.3.2.
    Simulation and validation of proposed system A preliminary simulation of the irrigation
    system has been carried out using the FL toolbox available in the Matlab/Simulink
    environment in order to build the fuzzy rules for each irrigation scenario and
    verify the system responses. The fuzzy rules are based on Mamdani''s “if-then”
    conditions. The 3D graphical representation of the temperature and soil moisture
    variables as a function of the irrigation time is given in Fig. 6. It is clear
    that the system allows the irrigation process with variable duration according
    to the parameters of the plants, the soil, and the weather conditions. Download

    3D Fuzzy logic graph of rules. 2.4. Irrigation unit The irrigation unit is composed
    of an impulse solenoid and diaphragm valve, distribution pipes, and emitters.
    The solenoid is controlled through the output signal provided by the controller
    unit. The opening time and duration can be adjusted according to the decision
    of the FL controller and vary depending on the conditions affecting the irrigation.
    The efficiency of the system is considered. For this purpose, a flow meter is
    located next to the valve to measure the water consumption in the distribution
    line. Moreover, the overall energy consumed during the operation under the adopted
    irrigation strategy is calculated from the installed voltage and current sensors.
    The obtained values are used to calculate the energy consumed per time unit. 2.5.
    LoRa based IoT communication unit In order to closely monitor the status of the
    irrigation system and to visualize the evolution of the parameters related to
    precision irrigation to fulfil the customer''s display requirements, ten parameters
    are displayed in a developed platform (See Fig. 7). This platform allows to follow
    in real-time the evolution of each parameter as well as the implementation of
    alerts (e-mail, telegram, and SMS) in case of failure (problems at the level of
    the sensors, condition on the irrigation parameters), moreover the transversal
    communication between the hardware and software part. The main page that is displayed
    contains an indication of the status of the system (on/off), the air temperature,
    the soil moisture, the soil temperature, the electrical conductivity, and the
    salinity. The irrigation duration provided by the FL controller, the evolution
    of the solar irradiance (the parameter is displayed as a percentage just to simplify
    the display) during each day is also displayed, and finally, the water flow rate
    distributed to the plant for each irrigation decision. An example of visualization

    frameworks, and a hardware environment containing boards with microcontrollers
    for processing as well as different communication shields for sending and receiving
    data, Fig. 9 represents the conception of each environment. Django is chosen given
    the multiple advantages that it presents, namely the robust development language
    Python, the ability to run with any client-side infrastructure, return data in
    any format namely HTML, RSS, JSON, XML, and provides robust security features
    that avoid common security errors (Srivastava et al., 2021). MySQL database is
    chosen as a manager owing to its many advantages in terms of rapidity, and ability
    to perform various operations using interfaces written in C, C++, Python, Java
    and PHP (Rao et al., 2014). The configuration of the manager is done at the Django
    framework level. Download : Download high-res image (247KB) Download : Download

    communication between the HTTP client and the platform is done through an API,
    which allows to interface and translate the requests received by the HTTP client
    to the server and return a response to the clients (when the Rest-API has what
    it needs, it sends back a response to the clients, typically be in JSON or XML
    format) (Ong et al., 2015). ATmega2560 programming is based on the Processing
    IDE and programmed with Arduino IDE software. The code is called a sketch and
    the assembly of several for functionalities are called libraries, which simplifies
    the user''s programming tasks by hiding the code in the libraries as a “black
    box”. The ATmega2560 can be programmed within the limits of 256 Kb of Flash memory
    with a clock rate of 16 MHz, moreover in this application of the smart precision
    irrigation system, it is autonomously working without being connected to an interface
    (computer) for control exchange. 2.6. Power unit The power consumption of the
    controller and sensor units, which represent a node in the proposed SPIS, is presented
    in Table 5. Specifically, the sensor unit consumes approximately 1.3 mA. Current
    investigations are being conducted to test the effectiveness of using small batteries
    to power this node. Based on initial estimations, two batteries of 6600 mAh associated
    in parallel could potentially provide a supply duration of around 1 year. This
    allows for reliable data collection with long-range capabilities and the ability
    to record hourly data. Table 5. Current consumption of the proposed system. Sensor

    the primary goal is to gather precise and comprehensive data. To achieve this,
    an integrated system that relies on a PV panel for power supply coupled with batteries.
    3. Operating steps of the proposed irrigation system The operating steps of the
    proposed system are shown in Fig. 10. In the first step, the precipitation status
    is checked, if the sensor indicates that availability, the system is turned off,
    otherwise the system proceeds to the next step of sensing the values received
    by the sensor unit hourly (ambient temperature, solar irradiation and soil moisture).
    The time and duration of irrigation is given after applying the appropriately
    designed fuzzy rules by reasoning according to the information from these sensors.

    Fig. 10. Operating steps of the proposed irrigation system. In this study, the
    information generated by the soil moisture sensor indicates the requirement for
    irrigation. According to the expert of agriculture, the optimal threshold of soil
    moisture for apple tree’s is 30 %. Therefore, the measurement of this variable
    is taken into account in this study. For each situation and variation of the input
    variables of the FL controller, the result is determined by the rules summarized
    in tables 2,3 and 4. Some real scenarios examples are given as follow: • If the
    soil is wet, i.e. exceeds 30 %, and regardless of the values of solar irradiance
    and ambient temperature, the irrigation decision is given by a duration equal
    to zero. • If the soil moisture equals 30 %, and regardless the value of all input
    variables, the system remains turned off, with a null irrigation duration decision.
    • If the soil contains an average soil moisture value, with an average temperature
    and solar irradiance, then the irrigation duration is set to very short duration.
    • If the soil is dry with a high temperature and a minimum solar irradiance, the
    duration is set to zero, since the high temperatures generate an increase in evaporation
    and water loses. In the area where the experiment is conducted, the process of
    water aspiration through the soil has been estimated at 60 min. This duration
    is based on experimental measurements for a well-known soil constitution. The
    system is programmed to restart the same sequences, which justifies the frequency
    of sending data to the platform. 4. Software and hardware implementation The FL
    controller has been implemented in real-time through a code in C language adapted
    with ATmega2560 microcontroller, the structure of the code is given as follows:
    firstly, a declaration of the libraries to be used, namely that of the FL, the
    sensors used, the actuators (relay) that is used to control the impulse solenoid
    and the display. After acquiring the data, the processing by fuzzy controllers
    begins. The fuzzy logic code is devised in three parts, first is the design of
    the membership functions by using equations (4), (5) on each of the three inputs
    (soil moisture, ambient temperature, and solar irradiance) and defining the variation
    ranges. Secondly the design of the fuzzy rules, in our case 27 rules are implemented.
    The last part is the defuzzification, which consists in assigning the results
    to the output in the form of linguistic variable to be exploited afterwards. The
    output being the duration and the time of irrigation, this value is converted
    into control signal form to activate the relay that enables to activate the electro
    valve and pump to start the irrigation process. The controller is programmed to
    repeat the same sequences every hour, the program performs and schedule automatically
    the duration and times of irrigation periods without any human intervention. The
    communication between the control unit (ATmega2560), the sensors unit, the irrigation
    unit and the IoT platform is realized via the ESP32 development board by sending
    instructions. The SPIS prototype is shown in Fig. 11, and the irrigation unit
    is shown in Fig. 12. The control unit, which provides decisions, and the sensor
    unit are assembled in a case with an IP67 degree of protection. After receiving
    the decision from the FL controller, an electric control signal is sent back to
    the solenoid. It should be noted that the solenoid is impulse driven, i.e., for
    switching on and off states, it is sufficient to send only one impulse for micro-seconds.
    The operation of the solenoid according to the time decided by the proposed fuzzy
    controller, operates on the internal membrane of the valve. The component list
    used in its conception is summarized in Table 6. Download : Download high-res

    in the agricultural area (A), are presented in Fig. 14, Fig. 15, Fig. 16, Fig.
    17. The experimentation has been conducted over ten days of two different seasons,
    the summer of 2022 and the winter of 2023, this allowed to obtain an overview
    of the behaviour of the system as well as to perform a test under different meteorological
    variations in order to approve the efficiency of the adopted soil-weather approach.

    data for the summer period from 05/09/2022 to 14/09/2022 are presented in Fig.
    14 (a) The data are sensed hourly and consist of temperature (T) and solar irradiance
    (G) measurements. The highest and lowest temperatures are 37.72 °C and 15.32 °C
    respectively. The solar irradiance values vary from 0 to 1000 W/m2, indicating
    the intensity of solar radiation received during each hour. It can be observed
    that lower solar irradiance values occur during the night-time hours, indicating
    the absence of sunlight. As the day progresses, the solar irradiance values increase,
    reaching their peak at 1000 W/m2. The temperature fluctuations correlate with
    the solar irradiance values, as higher solar irradiance leads to higher temperatures.
    The collected data from the sensor unit of the SPIS have been cross validated
    with the measurements obtained from a trusted meteorological station. These validations
    have confirmed the accuracy of the collected data, with minimal margin of error.
    During the 10-day performance evaluation, it can be observed that the FL controller
    effectively avoids operating the system during periods of high temperatures and
    intense solar radiation, as depicted in Fig. 14 (b) and Fig. 14 (c) and decides
    on short durations when input variables are medium. This strategy significantly
    contributes to the reduction of ET losses throughout the day. Additionally, by
    referring to the well-designed fuzzy rules, the FL controller selects the appropriate
    timing and duration for system operation. Consequently, the actual soil moisture
    closely tracks the desired value of 30 % with smooth oscillations (See Fig. 14
    (d)), in contrast to traditional single input- single output (SISO) feedback systems
    that often result in low irrigation performance. This performance evaluation over
    the 10-day period demonstrates the effectiveness and improved performance of the
    FL in maintaining optimal soil moisture levels while minimizing water loss. An
    extensive performance analysis has been conducted on two specific days of summer
    period (13 and 14 September), to understand the overall operation of the SPIS
    (See Fig. 15). September 13th (13/09/2022) represents the operational conditions
    of the system that persist throughout the 10-day experimental period in September
    (summer). By observing the system''s performance on this day, valuable insights
    can be gained regarding its sustained operation throughout the experiment. In
    addition, September 14th (14/09/2022) has been chosen due to the presence of precipitation.
    This provides an opportunity to assess the system''s performance under the same
    conditions (high weather parameters variation), but with the added factor of precipitation.
    Analysing its behaviour on a day with precipitation allows for an evaluation of
    the system''s ability to cope with such weather conditions. Throughout the selected
    two-days observation period, it is evident that the FL-based irrigation system
    allowed for considerable irrigation durations during periods of minimal variation
    in meteorological conditions as seen in point A (See Fig. 15). However, it effectively
    avoided irrigation during high-temperature and solar radiation conditions, as
    observed in point B. Consequently, the system reprograms the irrigation decision
    until conditions reached minimal or intermediate values. These decisions have
    been automatically made by the system based on fuzzy rules summarized in Table
    2, Table 3 of section 2.3. Given the high hourly ET rate during the observed period
    in point B, it was apparent that the amount of water applied during irrigation
    would be lost to the air without benefiting the crops. This finding aligns with
    expert recommendations on irrigation practices. In the case of point C, where
    soil moisture is about 24 % and the solar irradiance variable is at a minimum
    value (G = 17 w/m2) while the temperature in a medium value (T = 29 °C), the irrigation
    duration is decided as medium. This approach effectively minimized losses in terms
    of ET. A similar decision was observed in point F, where G = 330 w/m2 and T =
    24 °C. The system consistently made the decision to withhold irrigation when soil
    moisture reached the pre-defined value set by the farmer. This is being observed
    in multiple points during the experimental days, particularly at points D. Additionally,
    the system maintained the same decision (null duration of irrigation) in the presence
    of precipitation, as observed in points E. The average applied amount of water
    for the first day was 529,6L, over the irrigated area which is approximately 100
    m2. It follows that the proposed FL-irrigation control system provides appropriate
    duration to the irrigation unit of the field to apply an average of 5.29L/day/m2,
    that is, 5.29 mm/day. This is similar to the daily estimated ET value using the
    Penman-Monteith FAO model, which is about 5.31 mm/day (according to data collected
    from the sensor unit). Similarly for the second day, the system permit applying
    an average of 471,4L/day/m2, while the ET value is about 4,73 mm/day. The proposed
    irrigation-based soil-weather approaches have been verified under summer period,
    the FL controller avoids applying water during periods when there are significant
    variations in weather conditions (See Fig. 16), this avoids the loss of water
    through evaporation processes, while keeping the plants in a better condition,
    i.e., no stress. In addition, as noted, the duration of irrigation varies depending
    on the conditions measured by the sensors, namely, soil moisture, ambient temperature,
    solar radiation, air humidity and rainfall. 5.2. Inter period Likewise, the obtained
    results during the winter period over 10 days (From 11/01/2023 to 20/01/2023)
    show that the irrigation system is operating in efficient mode and compensates
    the quantities of water required by the plants while considering the values of
    solar irradiance and temperature which are practically small and average during
    this period. A daily average of 1.98 mm/day, has been applied to the soil, which
    permits maintaining a soil moisture close to the predefined value of soil moisture
    30 % defined by the user (See Fig. 17). During this period, the system considers
    the presence of rainfall rates, to minimize the over-irrigation that influence
    the plants. The evolution of soil moisture is shown in Fig. 17 (d). It is remarkable
    that this variable reaches maximums of about 48 % since the precipitation rate
    are important. The duration and period of irrigation are always optimized during
    the variations of solar irradiance and temperature (See Fig. 17 (b) and Fig. 17
    (c)). The system avoids applying water to the plants during the night period,
    this is justified by the minimal ET rate during this period, and low irradiance
    and temperatures values therefore the irrigation durations are at mid-days. In
    summary, the aforementioned results indicate that the proposed irrigation system
    based on the soil-weather approach and fuzzy concept effectively compensates water
    losses in semi-arid regions where the experiment has been conducted, ensuring
    optimal hydration for well-watered and actively growing crops. The SPIS also has
    the capability to adjust water requirements according to weather conditions that
    influence the irrigation process, thereby facilitating improved irrigation management.
    Achieving a forecast of irrigation duration for several days would entail the
    creation of suitable artificial intelligence algorithms, such as artificial neural
    networks (ANN), long term short memory (LSTM), and support vector machines (SVM)
    which can be trained using extensive data collected through the SPIS. At present,
    our team is actively engaged in the development of these algorithms, as well as
    expanding the system to cover larger agricultural areas. 5.3. Water and energy
    consumption analysis The energy and water consumption at the level of the “irrigation
    unit” in the ‘A’ and ‘B’ areas of the experiment field have been carried out.
    It should be noted that the ''A'' area is furnished with drip irrigation pipes,
    along with the proposed SPIS and an impulse solenoid valve, and ‘B’ area is equipped
    only with a manual drip irrigation based commercial timer to preset the applied
    water flow and period which are performed according to the knowledge and visualisation
    of the water-stress on the leaves by the farmer. It is noted also that the ‘B’
    area contains a classical solenoid, which require a significant current to maintain
    the On state compared to the adopted impulse solenoid. During the summer period,
    the farmer refers to a commercial timer to regulate a fixed water flow rate of
    approximately 11 mm/day for ‘B’ area. This estimation was based solely on the
    observation of climatic conditions, neglecting the influence of irrigation quantities
    on plant growth and soil moisture dynamics. Conversely, the proposed irrigation
    system demonstrated its efficacy in area ‘A’ through the evaluation of climatic
    and soil variables. It effectively delivered a precise water supply while maintaining
    soil moisture levels near the optimal range for apple trees. By incorporating
    these variables, the proposed irrigation system proficiently optimized the water
    supply for apple trees, resulting in a notable water-saving of nearly 61 % (±2%)
    over a 10-day period. The farmer consciously decided to apply an average of 110
    mm of water, whereas the SPIS determined a more optimal irrigation amount of 51.6
    mm, equivalent to an approximate daily application rate of 5.16 mm/day. This demonstration
    underscores the system''s efficiency and significance in precise irrigation management,
    ensuring the health and optimal growth of plants. Similarly, the power consumption
    in area ‘B’ stands at approximately 620Wh. Nevertheless, by optimizing water usage
    levels using the proposed SPIS-based FL decision and impulse solenoids, a remarkable
    reduction of approximately 46 % in overall power consumption has been achieved.
    6. Conclusion In this paper, a feedback FL control and combined soil-weather approach
    were presented, to foster water conservation and better irrigation scheduling
    and management in the eastern agriculture fields of Morocco. The fuzzy controller,
    developed based on Mamdani fuzzification using trapezoidal and triangular membership
    functions, effectively determined the duration of irrigation for crops. This utilization
    of FL control played a crucial role in maintaining soil moisture levels above
    pre-defined thresholds, exhibiting slight oscillations to prevent excessive run-off,
    thus conserving water and energy resources. To facilitate real-time performance
    monitoring and the creation of a comprehensive database, LoRa protocol has been
    utilised to communicate with a developed IoT platform. This enabled data to be
    collected on key environmental and climatic variables, as well as precise information
    on irrigation duration and soil proprieties. Presently, this is significantly
    contributing to data analysis and enhancing system performance. Implementing the
    system is straightforward, and its economic viability. CRediT authorship contribution

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: PUDUCHERRY, India SECTION I. Introduction
    Developed to solve the problem. In the proposed automated irrigation system, Zigbee
    technology will be utilized to assist in determining the amount of water that
    the soil will require. There is a sensor available on the market today that can
    provide information on the temperature, humidity, and degree of moisture present
    in the soil. If the reading from the sensor falls within a specified range that
    ensures the healthiest development of the crop, then the irrigation will start
    on its own. [2] Intelligent farming cannot be successful without the implementation
    of effective strategies for the management of its resources, particularly in the
    context of irrigation. According to projections made by the World Bank, by the
    end of the next several decades, agriculture will require more than seventy percent
    of the world''s available freshwater resources. In light of this occurrence, water
    efficiency and the optimization of agricultural water usage are of crucial importance,
    and it is imperative that researchers always keep these issues in mind when conducting
    their work. Intelligent systems are finding more and more applications in a diverse
    range of settings, particularly those that place a premium on efficient utilization
    and allocation of available resources. Improvements in irrigation, decision-making,
    disease prediction and control, and energy efficiency are only some of the many
    advantages that the smart system delivers to farming [3]. An integrated entity
    that executes numerous automated functions inside a single framework is referred
    to as a “smart system,” and the word “smart system” is used to characterize such
    an entity. These automated jobs include detecting, controlling, activating, analyzing,
    and making decisions. It is absolutely necessary to have access to a wide variety
    of cutting-edge methods, networking capabilities, sensing capabilities, and computational
    intelligence in order to guarantee the effective operation of automated processes
    [4]. If you use one of the numerous innovative techniques that are currently accessible,
    you may boost efficiency and save water at the same time. Because of advancements
    in irrigation technology and more sustainable farming practices, a smaller amount
    of drinkable water is required for agriculture. By combining IoT and ML, it is
    possible to provide centralized data processing, analysis, and decisionmaking
    capabilities [5]. This is made possible with the assistance of a large number
    of pervasive sensors. When it is necessary to artificially allocate resources
    in the agricultural sector, such as water, the installation of an irrigation system
    becomes crucial. This is because irrigation systems allow for more precise control
    over resource distribution. In regions that receive little to no rainfall on a
    regular basis, one of the most popular applications for this kind of irrigation
    is to maintain a consistent temperature and level of moisture in the soil. Farmers
    that utilize various forms of artificial irrigation have demonstrated an enhanced
    capacity to control weed infestations and slow the spread of invasive plant species.
    A scholarly modification is not possible with the user''s text because it does
    not provide enough information or context. The two basic categories that can be
    further subdivided are the traditional irrigation systems, on the one hand, and
    the modern irrigation systems, on the other. The conventional approach calls for
    the utilization of a wide range of watering implements, such as canals, cans,
    and buckets. The user does not need to have any specialized technical knowledge
    in order to implement the four most prevalent historical systems of irrigation,
    which are the basin, furrow, strip, and basin. Using the conventional approach
    to watering would be prohibitively expensive for our business [7]. The modern
    way of crop irrigation is built on the foundation of the more conventional approach,
    but it makes use of the most advanced technology to achieve the best possible
    outcomes. Sprinklers, drip irrigation, and containers that are watered by hand
    are the three methods of irrigation that are utilized most frequently nowadays.
    Irrigation techniques that are now in use are capable of subdividing into a diverse
    array of subgroups [8]. There are numerous varieties of evapotranspiration controllers,
    and each one has its own peculiarities and characteristics. A few examples of
    these are signal-based controllers, historical controllers, and controllers for
    on-site weather measurement irrigation systems. The text submitted by the user
    provides no context or explanation. The controller of the soil moisture sensor
    will analyze the characteristics of the irrigation system to identify whether
    it is a water-on-demand system or a suspended cycle system. The system will then
    be categorized appropriately. Meaningful categories are developed on the basis
    of the functions performed by constituent elements and the qualities held by those
    elements. SECTION II. Related Works In recent years, there has been a speedy increase
    in the scope of agricultural research and development activities all over the
    world. There has been a discernible shift in the focus of research towards investigating
    critical components such as soil temperature, soil pH, and other variables due
    to the urgent need to enhance agricultural yield. This movement in focus can be
    attributed to the need to boost crop output. Electromagnetic sensors were used
    to determine the amount of moisture in the soil [10], and after that, an irrigation
    system was installed in that particular location. The results of these studies
    indicate a 53% decrease in water waste in comparison to the current situation.
    It has been demonstrated that drip irrigation is successful due to the fact that
    it cuts down on the amount of water that is wasted and enables targeted delivery
    of nutrients and water to the root zone. When referring to an integrated circuit
    that combines a microprocessor core with other components, the term “microcontroller”
    is typically the one that is used. [11] One innovation that has had a significant
    impact on farming practices is sensor-controlled drip irrigation. When determining
    the rate of evapotranspiration, it is imperative to take into consideration irrigation
    as a significant extra element. The rate of water that a plant loses to the surrounding
    air through the process of transpiration is referred to as the evapotranspiration
    (ET) rate. Numerous factors, such as the type of plant, the speed of the wind,
    the air moisture, the ambient temperature, and even the body mass index, amongst
    others, have a significant influence on the rate [12]. Farmers ought to be able
    to improve both the size of their profits and the size of the agricultural market
    with the assistance of the Wireless Sensor Network, also known as WSN. In the
    agricultural industry, wireless sensor networks (WSN) field sensors are used to
    monitor crucial characteristics such as soil moisture and temperature, both of
    which have a significant impact on soil fertility. The data that is gathered from
    these measurements will then be disseminated to the environment that is being
    observed [13]. ZigBee is a wireless communication technology that allows for standardized
    data interchange and comparison of the data that has been collected [14]. This
    is made possible since all sensing components share a frequency with one another.

    who also ensures that the network is making the most of the power supply it has
    available. Accounting for MAC requirements is critically important for both the
    management of energy and the usage of wireless sensor networks (WSN) for monitoring
    the condition of soil. Real-time monitoring of energy use in agricultural settings
    is now a practically viable option as a result of the development of beacon-based
    wireless sensor networks [15,16]. The use of sensor networks, which are characterized
    by their compact size and high degree of precision, has the potential to reduce
    the cost of computationally intensive software and hardware by a significant amount.
    Wireless mobile sensor networks (WSNs) have the ability to increase the amount
    of time that network sensors can go without needing to be recharged. This is accomplished
    by shifting idle sensors to new places. When applied to the gearbox system, modeling
    and optimization approaches can boost network uptime while simultaneously reducing
    overall energy usage. In this study, a self-sufficient watering system was developed
    with the help of an Arduino microprocessor, grove moisture sensors, and water
    flow sensors [17]. ZigBee is a communications protocol that is frequently used
    by Arduino microcontrollers because it enables wireless data transport. When determining
    whether or not the ground is sufficiently wet, this method is utilized. When the
    relative humidity reaches a threshold that has been established in advance, the
    water pressure inside the pipe is adjusted so that it continues to be proportional
    to the level of change that has occurred. Users are able to monitor the motor''s
    moisture level and run time with the use of a current database that includes flow,
    water pressure, moisture content, and operating time [18]. This information may
    be accessed by displays and mobile devices that are enabled with GSM technology.
    This is made feasible by the utilization of a database. This article digs into
    the specifics of constructing a big autonomous irrigation system that makes effective
    use of both water and labor by incorporating wireless ZigBee technology. This
    allows for greater efficiency in the use of both resources. This undertaking will
    be finished by the system in the most efficient way feasible [19]. The protocol,
    network, controller, and coordinator of the ZigBee system, in addition to the
    software algorithm, are all clearly detailed. The objective of this study was
    to investigate a number of properties of soil, including its water-flow rate,
    electrical conductivity, and other elements. In order to ease the wider deployment
    of MFPz in open field conditions, ZigBee was employed as the wireless sensor network
    (WSN) component of a multi-hop ad hoc network. For the purpose of providing power
    to its wireless microcontroller, the MFPz made use of a radio chip that complied
    with the IEEE 802.15.4 standard [20]. This study provides a comprehensive review
    of the procedures that must be followed in order to develop a precision linear
    move irrigation system that is adapted to a specific location. In addition to
    this, it digs into the topic of developing a wireless sensor network as well as
    the software that goes along with it for real-time field management and monitoring.
    In this work, a great deal of depth is devoted to the investigation of these particulars
    [21]. The author of this work developed a sophisticated automated irrigation system
    to assist farmers in making more efficient use of the water that is available.
    In a decentralized wireless sensor network, temperature and moisture sensors are
    positioned close to the plant''s roots. Management of water distribution can be
    simplified significantly with the implementation of a gateway device that is based
    on a microcontroller platform [22]. The findings of this research offer a practicable
    technique for controlling irrigation in the cultivation of crops in containers.
    Utilizing a wireless sensor network makes it feasible to collect data in real
    time on the state of the soil as well as the surrounding environment. A warning
    is sent to the farmer via text message [23] when there is an impending lack of
    water in a particular region. This research presents a ground-breaking automated
    system that makesuse of GSM and ZigBee technologies. The purpose of this system
    is to monitor the growth of crops and determine the optimal time to water them.
    A large number of sensors have been installed [24] in order to improve the efficiency
    of the drip irrigation system and, as a result, cut down on the amount of water
    that is wasted. The information that the sensors have acquired is transmitted
    to the ICC via a microcontroller in each of the sensors. After that, the International
    Cricket Council (ICC) makes use of the ZigBee technology for data collecting.
    SECTION III. Proposed Work The system design procedure that has been suggested
    can be carried out in different ways. The top-down method is one strategy, and
    the bottom-up method is another. You can see how the approach that is advised
    to be used for system design is separated into five distinct phases by looking
    at figure 1 below. Figure 1: Proposed system design process Show All Data is gathered
    in real time from a wide variety of environmental circumstances via sensors that
    are deployed in the field. We conduct tests on the moisture, temperature, humidity,
    and light levels of the soil at regular intervals. The data that is gathered by
    the sensor nodes is then sent to a central Arduino device in a wireless manner
    by means of the Zigbee protocol. Zigbee is an excellent choice for this application
    since it has a low power consumption and the capability of long range communication.
    These are only two of the many appealing properties that Zigbee possesses. The
    information from the sensor is gathered by the Arduino device, which subsequently
    processes the information using a program that analyzes AI. The artificial intelligence
    system performs data analysis using machine learning techniques and then bases
    its conclusions on the results of those studies in addition to other parameters.
    An artificial intelligence software runs the data from the sensors to decide whether
    or not the plants need to be watered. In the course of the study, a wide variety
    of elements, including soil moisture, climate, crop type, and the requirements
    for supplemental irrigation, are taken into consideration. The Arduino first determines
    which actuators should be used to water the crops based on the results drawn by
    the AI system, and then it activates those actuators. The system activates either
    solenoid valves or pumps in order to feed the field with the correct quantity
    of water at the proper time. The device performs a continuous check of the current
    weather conditions and makes any necessary adjustments to the watering operation
    at the appropriate times. Every day, the sensors gather information, and every
    day, the AI analyzes that information to determine how it may be used to make
    the irrigation system more efficient. The complete workflow process that is provided
    by the proposed system is illustrated in Figure 2. Figure 2: Architecture of the
    proposed system Show All It includes the partition for the given hardware device,
    performance, and trouble shooting has three nodes in it. Nodes 1 and 2 are referred
    to as sensing nodes, whereas node 3 is referred to as a receiving node. In an
    automated watering system, the receiver node is crucial. Although Nodes 1 and
    2 operate in the same way, the destination''s address differs. The receiving node
    has the destination''s address configured. Utilising sensors, Node 1 and Node
    2 detected the data, which was then sent to the ADC. It is converted from analogue
    to digital by an ADC before being sent to a UART for serial transmission. The
    PIC Microcontroller 18F458 has this built in. For wireless data transfer, ZigBee
    is utilised. The information collected at Nodes 1 and 2 is transmitted to the
    ZigBee node that is responsible for accepting data. Through the use of a PIC 18F458
    microcontroller, the information that has been acquired by this receiver node
    is presented on both an LCD and a PC. Following the selection of the suitable
    crop type and the crop that is wanted, the LCD and the PC will display the threshold
    value for the chosen crop and compare it to the value that is currently being
    displayed. If the current value is higher than the setpoint, then the action will
    be taken without further intervention automatically A. Implementation of the proposed
    system Implementation entails joining all the parts together and creating a suitable
    framework. As well include troubleshooting chores to keep the system operating
    efficiently. It is a challenging step because we need to determine why the system
    is malfunctioning. The sensor in the suggested system sends a signal to the microcontroller.
    The soil moisture sensor, humidity sensor, and temperature sensor each have three
    channels. With the aid of the ADC, sensory data is transformed to digital form
    and sent to the LCD for display. Following that, this data is sent via UART to
    ZigBee. Additionally, ZigBee outputs to the driver after comparing the sensor
    output with the predetermined values. UART is used transport the data to the master
    node for ZigBee. Information is gathered from nodes 1 and 2. There are four ways
    to choose a group of values for a specific crop. Switches use resisters as interfaces
    to Port E. For the buzzer, fan, and pump motor, three relays are employed. This
    relay connects to Pins RA0, RA1, and RA2, and BC547 is used to manage the additional
    power generated by the relay''s coil, which amplifies the signal from the PIC
    17F458 microcontroller. The information is shown on the PC and 16*4 LCD of the
    Master Node. The suggested system uses temperature, humidity, and moisture sensors
    to monitor agricultural fields, which would enhance the both the quality and volume
    of agricultural outputs. The information from the sensors may be monitored by
    the farmer at home; it is shown on the LCD of the master node and on a computer.
    A farmer can choose a certain crop, Within the master node are wheat, rice, jowar,
    and bajara. The microcontroller is programmed with a threshold value that corresponds
    to the moisture temperature, and humidity values needed for a particular crop.
    Actual values are sensed by infield sensors that soil moisture, temperature, and
    humidity. These numbers are contrasted with the cutoff numbers. The soil moisture
    is measured by the moisture sensor and the process is mathematically being expressed
    as SoilMoisture(ϕ)=a× ∑ i∈n (X( ρ 3 )) b (1) View Source Where, θ is the volumetric
    water content (the value you want to measure). a and b are sensor-specific calibration
    coefficients. The mathematical relationship between sensor resistance (R) and
    temperature (T) can be described using the SteinhartHart equation for thermistors
    and is expressed as 1 T =(A)+B× ∑ n R=1 ln(R)+C× ∑ n R=1 ln(R) (2) View Source
    Where A, B, and C are sensor-specific coefficients. Humidity sensors may use various
    technologies like capacitive, resistive, or thermal conductivity to measure relative
    humidity (RH). The mathematical relationship for converting sensor readings to
    RH typically involves calibration equations specific to the sensor type. For capacitive
    sensors, it might be a linear equation like RH(%)=m×(Sensor Reading)+b (3) View
    Source Where m and b are calibration coefficients. The relationship between sensor
    output and light intensity is often non-linear and sensor-specific. Calibration
    curves are commonly used to convert sensor readings to illuminance (lux) or other
    units. B. Artificial Intelligence based Crop Monitoring and Management system
    Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize agriculture by
    improving efficiency, productivity, and sustainability. AI-based systems for agriculture
    can help farmers make data-driven decisions, optimize resource allocation, and
    manage their farms more effectively. Artificial intelligence (AI) plays a pivotal
    role in revolutionizing agriculture through its diverse applications. AI leverages
    satellite and drone imagery for crop health monitoring, disease detection, and
    nutrient deficiency assessment. It utilizes predictive algorithms to forecast
    crop yields and optimal planting times using historical and realtime data. AI-driven
    analysis of field sensor data aids in precise irrigation and fertilization strategies.
    The algorithm for Artificial Intelligence based Crop Monitoring and Management
    system is shown in algorithm 1. Algorithm for an AI-based Crop Monitoring and
    Management System Initialize System Begin def initialize_system() load_ai_models()

    if name = = “main” initialize_system() main_loop() exit_system() End Autonomous
    robots and drones, powered by AI, excel in tasks like planting, weeding, and harvesting.
    AI contributes to pest and disease management via image recognition and early
    outbreak warnings. Furthermore, it predicts crop yields, optimizes supply chain
    logistics, enhances livestock health monitoring, and minimizes chemical interventions
    in weed and pest control. Additionally, AI assists in market price prediction,
    recommends soil improvement strategies, enables autonomous farm machinery, offers
    hyper-local weather forecasts, and delivers data-driven insights to empower farmers
    in decision-making processes. These AI applications collectively advance agricultural
    efficiency, sustainability, and productivity while catering to the needs of diverse
    farming contexts. SECTION IV. Results and Discussion Because the master node has
    a computer and an LCD screen, the farmer may monitor the readings from the sensors
    without having to leave the convenience of his own house. A farmer has the option
    of growing a variety of crops, including wheat, rice, jowar, and bajara, all of
    which are featured in the master node from which the farmer can select. The microcontroller
    is programmed to a particular threshold that is determined by the properties of
    moisture, temperature, and humidity that are required for a particular crop. Realtime
    information on a variety of environmental parameters, including temperature, humidity,
    and soil moisture, is gathered via sensors located in the field. The data are
    analysed in relation to the threshold values. An external event, such as a pump,
    fan, or alarm, is activated whenever the value reaches a threshold that has been
    previously established. The farmer selected rice as his crop, and then used Terminal
    version 1.9b to visualise the actual rice''s moisture, temperature, and humidity
    on both the master node and the personal computer, as well as to make comparisons
    and automate the process. The remaining crop varieties, which include wheat, jawar,
    and bajara, will be cultivated using this manner. When the irrigation for the
    crop is turned off, it results in a loss of revenue. Both the humidity and the
    moisture content of the soil are normal. When the irrigation system was turned
    on, the crop''s temperature, humidity, and soil moisture levels had all already
    surpassed the point that had been established for them. The farmer will receive
    an alert on the LCD and PC that is connected to the master node if the relative
    humidity of the crop rises above the threshold value in table 1. Table I: Humidity
    vs Time The graphical representation of the humidity value with respect to time
    is illustrated in figure 3. Figure 3: Humidity Vs Time Show All When the temperature
    of the crop reaches the predetermined threshold, the fan begins to rotate, and
    the relevant data is shown on the LCD and personal computer of the master node.
    The values corresponding to the temperature and time is shown in table 2. Table
    II Temperature vs Time The graphical representation of the temperature value with
    respect to time is illustrated in figure 4. Figure 4: Temperature vs Time Show
    All When the soil moisture value exceeds the crop''s threshold value, the pump
    turns on and displays information on the LCD and PC of the master node. The values
    corresponding to the Soil moisture value is shown in table III. Table III: Time
    vs Soil moisture value The graphical representation of the soil moisture value
    with respect to time is illustrated in figure 5. Figure 5: Time vs Soil moisture
    value Show All According to the forementioned outcome, we experimentally analysed
    that it operates automatically without requiring any human labour and also obtains
    an accurate result for monitoring the soil content, environmental considerations
    and effective energy utilization. The graph corresponding to the soil sample is
    illustrated in figure 6. Figure 6: Graph on Soil Sample Show All A comparison
    was made between the proposed AI based system and state-of-the-art methods typically
    involves evaluating several aspects, including accuracy, efficiency, scalability,
    cost-effectiveness, and environmental sustainability. The comparison of proposed
    method with the state of art method is discussed in table IV. Table IV: Comparison
    of state of art methods vs Proposed method AI models can provide highly accurate
    and precise information about crop health, pest and disease identification, yield
    predictions, and resource management. They can adapt and learn from data, continually
    improving their accuracy. Traditional methods may rely on manual observations,
    which can be subjective and less accurate. They may also lack the ability to provide
    real-time updates and predictions. AI algorithms can process vast amounts of data
    quickly, enabling real-time monitoring and decisionmaking. They can optimize resource
    allocation, such as water and fertilizer use, leading to more efficient farming
    practices. Traditional methods often require more time and labor, making them
    less efficient for data analysis, decisionmaking, and resource management. AI
    can be scaled for both small and large farms, allowing for customized solutions
    based on the size and needs of the operation. Traditional methods may be limited
    in their scalability, as they rely heavily on manual labor and may not be suitable
    for largescale farming. While initial setup costs for AI-based systems may be
    relatively high due to technology investments, they can lead to long-term cost
    savings through improved resource management and increased yields. Traditional
    methods may involve ongoing labor costs and the potential for resource wastage,
    making them less cost-effective in the long run. AI can optimize resource usage,
    reducing water and fertilizer wastage. It can also support sustainable farming
    practices by identifying and mitigating pest and disease outbreaks early. Traditional
    methods may result in overuse of resources and environmental damage, as they often
    lack the precision and efficiency of AI-based approaches. The average value corresponding
    to the comparison is shown in figure 7 Figure 7: Comparison of Proposed method
    with state of art method Show All AI systems can provide real-time updates on
    crop conditions, allowing farmers to respond promptly to changing conditions.
    AI models can adapt to different crops, regions, and environmental conditions,
    making them versatile and adaptable. Traditional methods may be less adaptable
    and may require significant adjustments for different farming scenarios. An AI-based
    Crop Monitoring and Management system offers advantages in terms of accuracy,
    efficiency, scalability, cost-effectiveness, and sustainability when compared
    to traditional or state-of-the-art methods. However, the adoption of AI technologies
    may require initial investments and technical expertise, which can be challenges
    for some farmers. Ultimately, the choice between these approaches depends on the
    specific needs and resources of the agricultural operation. SECTION V. Conclusion
    Arduino and Zigbee were used as part of a wireless sensor network in the creation
    and rollout of the AISupported Instinctive Irrigation System (IIS). This technology
    was developed to improve the efficacy and efficiency of irrigation management,
    which has many benefits. The current approach uses AI-powered algorithms, sensor
    data, and wireless connectivity to set up an advanced and fully automated irrigation
    system. The optimal watering schedule for plants is determined by the Intelligent
    Irrigation System (IIS), which use AI to analyze a variety of environmental elements
    such as temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and weather. This technology permits
    accurate and efficient irrigation, reducing the likelihood that stress and decreased
    yield would be experienced by plants as a result of either over- or under-watering.
    In addition, using Arduino microcontrollers provides a solid and flexible infrastructure
    for data collection, processing, and control. The ability of Arduino boards to
    interface with a wide variety of sensors has made the real-time monitoring of
    critical parameters a practical possibility. Afterwards, artificial intelligence
    systems can use the collected data to make educated decisions about where to allocate
    water supplies and when to schedule irrigation. Additionally, sensors, Arduino
    boards, and actuators are all able to effectively communicate with one another
    thanks to the Zigbee wireless sensor network. Zigbee''s low power requirements
    and robust mesh networking characteristics make it ideal for widespread rollouts,
    which in turn makes it possible to set up a distributed and networked irrigation
    system.” Authors Figures References Keywords Metrics More Like This An automatic

  description: Agriculture is the backbone of developing countries and it is very
    important to the country's economy. Therefore, automation must be used in agriculture
    to solve the issues. The proposed system is based on augmented reality intelligent
    precision agriculture using the smart sensor. It consists of the hardware ESP32
    microcontroller, DHT11 sensor, and Load, and the software unity hub in Augmented

    India SECTION I. Introduction Agriculture is the basic source of food grains and
    other raw materials in human life. The demand for crops rises in tandem with the
    growth of the human population. Food security will rise with real-time monitoring
    of a smart agricultural system''s understanding of soil moisture measurement,
    humidity, and ambient temperature [1]. Additionally, smart agriculture may raise
    production, decrease water waste, and increase crop output. This study suggests
    smart agriculture, which makes use of real-time, sensor-based monitoring without
    human involvement. All sensor data is captured and tracked at all times and from
    anywhere within the internet''s service area, and users have immediate access
    to real-time data [2]. The creation of a mobile application makes it easier for
    users to obtain data and track growth. This study evaluates agricultural elements
    that have an impact on yields, such as soil moisture, humidity, and temperature.
    One of the disruptive technologies in the IoT space that hasn''t been fully utilized
    is the deep learning algorithm, which may make human-computer interaction in smart
    surroundings more enjoyable and engaging [3]. This research proposes using applications
    in agriculture for water insect irrigation. AR and blynk are highly useful for
    providing customization and privacy to users of smart devices provided by IoT
    technology. This IoT device provides the user with a visually appealing and simple-to-use
    interface [4]. Using simple electronic components like Esp32, DHT 11, relays,
    and vuforia open-source platform, unity hub, and visual studio for operating a
    relay triggering and monitoring temperature and humidity in the agricultural field.
    Smart farming is a modern farming management concept that uses IoT technologies
    to boost agricultural output [5]. Additionally, farmers can lack the expertise
    necessary to effectively employ various instruments to gauge the appropriate environmental
    conditions for their crops [6]. They are given access to an automated system using
    IoT that may work without any human oversight and alert to deal with any issues
    they may encounter while farming [7]. The ability to reach and alert the farmer
    even while he or she is not in the field enables farmers to manage more farmland,
    increasing productivity. Nowadays, most individuals don''t have much time for
    caring for and watering the plants they prefer to cultivate in their irrigation
    systems [8]. Along with real-time temperature, soilmoisture, humidity, and water
    level data received from IoT sensors, fertilizers are also used. Additionally,
    this AR technology is used to provide a 3D view of the plants that are anticipated
    based on the soil conditions to the user [9]. Additionally, they protect plants
    or crops against several illnesses brought on by agricultural areas [10]. The
    temperature in the agriculture area should not go below a specific level, and
    crop humidity should be kept at a reasonable level. As a result, it helps farmers
    generate high returns and grow crops [11]. This study focuses on creating a method
    for managing water in commercial spaces, such as offices and universities, by
    utilizing IoT. Water supply management is crucial since it is such a precious
    resource. For the purpose of maintaining the water''s level and avoiding the agricultural
    area''s dry land, it is imperative to prevent tank overflows and use the water
    properly. The main contribution of the paper is as follows: To propose and assesses
    a cloud-based remote correspondence framework to screen and control a sensor to
    evaluate the plant''s water needs. This technique is significant in the control
    and management of insects in the water process. Farmers may view the entire farm
    in real time with applications. To develop real-time intelligent precision agriculture
    using the suggested deep learning approach to monitor and implemented to control
    the load and monitor the intelligent sensor. To monitor and control using the
    mobile applications AR and Blynk. Application is used to improve fertility testing
    and check the total production quality, see the entire farm on a single dashboard,
    and monitor the temperature and humidity values of the agricultural area. SECTION
    II. Related Works Nowadays, smart agriculture minimizes a variety of farming issues.
    Farmers obtain the necessary information and relevant data to monitor plant development
    by utilizing cloud technology, in which many sensors, actuators, and other embedded
    devices, and some parameters are recognized and controlled using a microcontroller
    [12]. Uncovered in the literature, a step-by-step process is provided for combining
    IoT with AR. With the use of an API request, any cloud server may access the Controller''s
    incoming data and store it in a database [13]. The goal of this research is to
    build IoT using inexpensive components while still keeping track of Blynk-based
    phones. The results of 10 tests using a BlackBox yield a water content of 20 cm,
    soil moisture of 60%, 80% humidity, and an average temperature of 21 C [14]. With
    the use of wireless sensor networks, we can receive and manage the agriculture
    parameters cloud to provide individual farmers with up-to-date information about
    the field so they may take corrective action to increase crop productivity [15].
    Intelligent IoT platform development Smart farming is gaining ground in wealthy
    countries. As a result, it is minimizing resource waste such as water, fertilizers,
    and operational costs [16]. Augmented reality is highly useful for providing users
    with smart devices equipped with IoT technologies. Such AR-enabled IoT devices
    provide the user with a visually beautiful and easy-to-use interface, as well
    as load control through Vuforia [17]. Three more services were employed in the
    plant development process: sensor data, a hosting provider, and a plant database
    accessible via an API [18]. To extract data such as soil moisture, temperature,
    and water levels, a variety of sensors have been used. This needs a greater emphasis
    on increasing water efficiency in irrigated agriculture [19]. To decrease water
    waste and make better use of it, sustainable irrigation methods are essential.
    IoT-based real-time alarm system and revolutionary weather monitoring system Arduino
    UNO is used to monitor temperature (t) and humidity in real-time appliances using
    a sample size of 10 values and 80% g power [20]. To decrease water waste and make
    better use of it, sustainable irrigation methods are essential. The drip irrigation
    system is an efficient strategy to minimize water use while maintaining agricultural
    output [21]. This study examines and describes approaches for reducing energy
    usage and managing power in embedded systems. The emphasis is on the design and
    deployment of energy-efficient embedded systems in wireless sensor networks, as
    well as the prospects for reducing energy consumption in such systems [22]. This
    study details the creation and assessment of an instructional augmented reality
    software whose goal is to promote aquaponics-based sustainable agriculture [23].
    The research discusses how augmented reality has to be used in conjunction with
    other technologies and application domains to be effective. As related-work examples
    are used to examine appropriate hardware techniques and limitations, attention
    is also given to how augmented reality should be used in agriculture (e.g., mobility)
    [24]. This system may design, construct, and automate a hydroponics system for
    managing and monitoring plant development, as well as assess the impact of utilizing
    a prototype of this system Important environmental parameters that affect plant
    growth are temperature, humidity, and water [25]. Gathering, processing, and uploading
    data to control information are the functions of this gateway. The data will be
    kept and uploaded later if the network connection fails. SECTION III. Methodology
    Agriculture must become more technologically advanced to meet these rising needs
    or demands of the cultivates. In this paper cloud technology is used to provide
    the AR and Blynk application that uses sensors to monitor crop fields. Farmers
    can monitor agricultural conditions from anywhere in the world. DHT11 sensors
    are being used by smart agriculture to evaluate the farm area''s temperature and
    humidity weather report. When it is necessary to insect the water in the irrigation
    system, the water insect the agricultural land by using the application. And these
    are all monitored and controlled by the AR. In addition, undertaken the implementation
    of low-cost IoT devices using blynk to monitor them Initia lly, create an account
    in vuforia and process the target image after will get the license key, the unity
    file is opened, and update the file to be opened AR camera and delete the main
    camera, add the vuforia engine license key, and create a 3D image in the unity
    hub. This research is required since automation is required in a variety of sectors.
    Other requirements, as a result of the recent increase in busyness. The goal of
    this research is to build IoT using inexpensive components while still keeping
    track the values in Blynk-based mobile applications and this used to control and
    monitor the data and load respectively. Fig. 1. Proposed system block diagram

    and Futurescope This paper implements a simple and very efficient to develop an
    experiment with a real area of agriculture to test the suggested deep learning
    approach used in the blynk and AR app. And this approach is being utilized to
    construct our prototype, allowing us to create an effieient, accurate, and low-cost
    solution for farmers. As a result, the prototype will help farmers on their farmland
    to effectively monitor their crops with the user-friendly application. The hardware
    of the sensor node is based on an ESP32 microcontroller equipped with sensors

    water by controlling AR and Blynk at the same time will control it automatically
    for the soil moisture sensor used. These sensors sense the irrigation land wet
    and dry if it needs the water outlet by controlling the AR application and the
    values are updated in both the AR application and Blynk. Authors Figures References

    communication 1. Introduction Crops are essential for human life because they
    provide food, animal feed, fuel, and raw materials for clothing and shelter. Crop
    yield has to be doubled in 2050 compared to 2009 in order to meet the demand of
    a growing population while increasing the food quality and reducing production
    inputs (Fukase and Martin, 2020). Potential solutions to enhance global food security
    include closing crop yield gaps, reducing food waste, changing dietary habits,
    and reducing inefficiencies in resource use (Foley et al., 2011). Reducing inefficiencies
    in input resources (such as water and nitrogen) can be achieved by continuously
    monitoring crops, soil, and microclimate, and then properly controlling inputs
    without sacrificing the yield and quality of the crop. Internet of Things (IoT)
    becomes a key technology that enables continuous monitoring and control in this
    scenario. The ability to generate (near) real-time quantitative data with high
    spatiotemporal resolution is a major advantage of IoT systems (Liao et al., 2017).
    IoTs are considered big data systems due to volumes, velocities, and varieties
    of data they generate. These data are mined and modeled to elucidate the relationships
    between inputs and outputs (Tsai et al., 2014). Correlation, trend analysis, classification,
    and numerical prediction are implemented on the data to reach meaningful control
    decisions. Compared with the conventional wireless sensor networks, the holistic
    approach of IoT technology allows users to incorporate data analytics on the big
    data collected by IoT sensor devices. Generally, connected actuators are enabled
    to control the inputs to achieve desired application rates. For example, an internet-connected
    soil water content (SWC) sensor network measures the plant water deficit and uploads
    data to a cloud-based data analysis platform. The analysis will find the trend
    of soil water deficit to determine the best time and quantity to apply irrigation
    water. There has been a boom in IoT application development in agriculture (Ag-IoT)
    in the last two decades, particularly around crop, soil, and microclimate monitoring.
    However, the application of Ag-IoT at the commercial scale is still at its early
    stages. A deeper and more holistic understanding of the existing IoT system development
    is important for various stakeholders to sketch the future landscape of Ag-IoT.
    Therefore, the main objective of this paper is to review the key components of
    Ag-IoT including sensors, actuators, data processing, and data transmission, summarize
    its usage in crop, soil, and microclimate monitoring, and identify the research
    needs for successful IoT implementation in the future. Though Ag-IoT is proliferating
    in both crop and animal monitoring and management, Ag-IoT for crop production
    is the focus of this paper. IoT platforms for livestock production, as well as
    other sectors of agriculture (such as postharvest) are not included. IoT can be
    found in the manufacturing industry, consumers products, retail, finance and marketing,
    healthcare, transportation and logistics, smart city, military applications and
    supply chains (Islam et al., 2022). Fig. 1 shows the three main layers of a generic
    IoT architecture: the perception layer, network layer, and application layer (Jabraeil
    Jamali et al., 2020). The perception layer consists of gateways, mobile devices,
    sensors, actuators, power, and energy storage components. Activities in the perception
    layer include sensing, controlling, actuation, energy harvesting, energy storage,
    data transmission, and power management. The perception layer of the Ag-IoT faces
    challenges including harsh environmental conditions, heterogeneity of the applications,
    nonavailability of communication infrastructure, and lack of continuous power
    supplies, to just mention a few. This review therefore emphasizes the perception
    layer of Ag-IoT. The network layer consists of network devices and data transmission
    and processing functions. The application layer is responsible for user-specific
    applications such as data visualization, actuator control dashboards, as well
    as data storage, analysis, and decision making. This three-layer architecture
    of IoT can be expanded to five layers by including transport layer after network
    layer and adding business layer after the application layer (Banu, 2018). The
    transport layer is responsible for data transmission while the business layer
    manages the whole IoT system according to the user''s business model. Download

    Three- and five-layer architectures of generic IoT systems. The rest of the paper
    is organized as follows. The method of the literature review is presented in Section
    two. Section three details the major elements of Ag-IoT technology. Section four
    describes the challenges that Ag-IoT systems face with emerging solutions. In
    Section five, supporting technologies for Ag-IoT are discussed. How the information
    from Ag-IoT can benefit farm systems analysis and management is discussed in Section
    six. The final section concludes the review article with future research directions.
    2. Review methodology We have come up with a list of eleven research questions
    to guide the literature review and analysis in Ag-IoT. These questions, along
    with the motivation to ask these questions and our initial hypotheses, are listed

    in Table 1, a thorough literature review was conducted. The main approach was
    to find the answers based on the recent research carried out in the field of Ag-IoT.
    We have searched for the recent Ag-IoT research published in scientific journals
    and conference proceedings between 2011 and 2021, using keywords through Google
    Scholar and Scopus web search. Keywords used in the search were Internet of Things,
    IoT, Crop Monitoring, Wireless Sensor Network, Smart Agriculture, and Crop Sensing.
    This search resulted in 200 peer-reviewed journal articles and conference proceedings
    papers. After reading the abstracts, 115 papers were determined to be relevant
    to the topic of Ag-IoT. The selected articles are listed in the Appendix, and
    they were used for in-depth analysis. Research papers selected covered countries
    in all six continents (except for Antarctica, Fig. 2a). Asia presented the largest
    number of papers (Scotford and Miller, 2004), whereas Australia had the smallest
    number of papers. In terms of countries, India (Coleman et al., 2022) and China
    (Chen et al., 2014) had the highest numbers of research outcomes. Fig. 2b presented
    the yearly distribution of the research papers. The number of research papers
    published related to the topic increased over time, with the highest in 2019.
    Demographics of the collected data set provided the answer to question 1 in Table
    1, that Ag-IoT has received global attention. More Ag-IoT research has been completed
    in countries with smallholder farmers such as India and China. The selected papers
    were read carefully and analyzed for the technical specification of the IoT systems,
    including the sensors and actuators in each study, communication technologies
    used, environment the system implemented, and the IoT service provider used. Download

    In Section 3, we have thoroughly reviewed the major components of Ag-IoT. To conduct
    this review systematically, we have divided this section into multiple subsections.
    These subsections are sensors, IoT platforms/main control board, wireless communication
    technology, IoT protocols, cloud platforms, power and energy management, and actuators.
    3.1. Sensors Sensors play a major role in Ag-IoT systems because they serve as
    the converter between real-world signals and their digital representations. This
    section begins with an introduction and categorization of sensors used to measure
    crop, soil, and microclimate parameters. General purpose sensors such as temperature
    sensor, light intensity sensor, accelerometers, soil moisture sensor, etc., can
    be integrated into Ag-IoT systems (White, 1987). Table 2 gives sensor categories
    along with sensor measurands and provides some examples found in the literature.

    et al., 2017) Proper selection of sensors to an application is essential for IoT
    systems developers as well as for users to best use the sensors. The advancement
    of sensor technologies has a major impact on the popularity of IoT. Low energy
    consumption, compatibility in data transmission between the microcontroller and
    the sensor, accuracy, repeatability, sensitivity, and robustness are major considerations
    to select a sensor for IoT system development. To address research question 2
    in Table 1, we marked and counted the sensors in the 115 research papers reviewed,
    with the total count of each sensor given in Fig. 3. Soil moisture sensors were
    used for the largest number of applications (Ivanova et al., 2016) followed by
    humidity sensors (Hurst et al., 2021) and then air temperature sensors (Haque
    et al., 2021). The reason these sensors were integrated most in Ag-IoT so far
    is likely because of the need for continuous in-situ soil moisture monitoring
    for decision making in irrigated agricultural production. Water scarcity is a
    global issue, and the amount of arable land can be expanded significantly if growers
    can apply water efficiently (Aroca et al., 2018). On the contrary, soil water
    tension measured via soil water potential sensors only appeared in three papers.
    This lower interest in soil water potential sensors is likely due to (1) less
    understanding of the relationship between soil water tension and crop growth,
    (2) less availability of low-cost soil water potential sensors, and (3) the difficulty
    in interfacing the available soil water potential sensors to the IoT platforms.
    Next, we will discuss the Ag-IoT sensors found in the literature according to
    the measurand category it belongs to. Download : Download high-res image (192KB)
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Various sensors found in reviewed
    research papers and their frequency. 3.1.1. Acoustic sensors Ultrasound distance
    measurement sensors and microphones are the most common acoustic property measuring
    sensors. Direct use of acoustic measurements is limited in Ag-IoT. Hardwood borer
    identification IoT sensor network is a direct application of microphone used in
    pest detection in forestry (Potamitis et al., 2019). Ultrasonic wind speed and
    direction sensor is an important meteorological sensor used in agriculture to
    estimate evapotranspiration (Kameoka et al., 2017). Compared with the mechanical
    anemometer, an ultrasonic anemometer requires less maintenance due to fewer mechanical
    parts involved. Furthermore, an ultrasonic anemometer can capture sudden changes
    in wind speed and direction very accurately. Acoustic sensors were used indirectly
    to measure biological measurands. Crop canopy height estimation by ultrasound
    sensor is an indirect approach to measure biological parameters (Yuan et al.,
    2018; Elci et al., 2018). IoT-enabled ultrasound distance sensors are widely used
    in irrigation systems to estimate the water volume in tanks, wells and reservoirs,
    and it is an essential sensor for irrigation scheduling in automated irrigation
    systems. Recently ultrasound flow meters replaced the mechanical flow meters due
    to their high accuracy in flow rate measurement with less maintenance. Underwater
    ultrasound scanning is possible for aquatic plant growth monitoring purposes such
    as lotas and seaweed and has a huge potential to determine the harvest stage and
    growth rate monitoring (Kool and Bernard, 2019). Fruit ripeness estimation is
    an interesting example of the indirect use of acoustics in agriculture. Daosawang
    et al. (2020) demonstrated that watermelon ripeness could be estimated by a sound
    generator and receiver. In summary, acoustic sensors advanced in recent years
    while replacing some traditional mechanical Ag-sensors and introducing new applications
    in agriculture. 3.1.2. Biological sensors Above-ground biomass of plant, plant
    height, plant density, leaf angle, leaf area index (LAI), count of plant organs
    (leaf, fruit, flower), chlorophyll concentration, sap flow, and stomata conductance
    are useful biological parameters in crop monitoring. Crop yield and the growth
    stage can be estimated from the plant''s mass (biomass). Loadcells are used in
    indoor farming pots to measure the plant weight directly (Long and McCallum, 2015).
    Almost all the field crop biomass estimations have been measured by indirect sensing
    techniques such as biomass-sensitive vegetation indices (VI) or by image processing-based
    techniques. However, both techniques require time-consuming ground truth data
    collection for model calibration. The accuracy of these techniques is subject
    to lighting conditions, sensor type, crop type, model parameters, and training
    data set. Just like crop biomass, many other biological measurands are also estimated
    indirectly. For example, stomata conductance can be quantified through optical
    measurands, and plant height through acoustic sensors. Therefore, most of the
    biological measurands will be discussed as indirect applications under other measurands.
    3.1.3. Chemical sensors Chemical sensors can be categorized into two main types:
    photochemical and electrochemical. Photochemical sensors measure chemical reactions
    or chemicals by their spectral signature, and electrochemical sensors measure
    the electrical properties due to chemical reactions or the presence of chemicals
    (Angkawinitwong and Williams, 2021). Soil pH, soil salinity, soil nutrients, oxygen
    (O2), carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), pH and conductivity of irrigation water,
    and photosynthesis are the parameters that often measured by chemical sensors.
    Knowing the pH of water and soil is important because pH affects the solubility
    of nutrients and therefore plant nutrient uptake and growth. Soil and irrigation
    water pH measurements with IoT-enabled sensors were demonstrated in the literature
    in nine studies. Spatial variability and the dependency of sensor accuracy on
    soil condition are the issues to address to promote them in agriculture (Chen
    et al., 2019; Li et al., 2020). The soil salinity sensor and custom-made nitrate
    sensor were counted only once, which highlighted the difficulty of measuring soil
    chemical properties continuously and in a non-destructive manner. The measurement
    of the real-time nutrient content in the soil, especially nitrogen (N), phosphorus
    (P), and potassium (K) are essential for fertigation. These sensors are still
    at the rudimentary stage (Burton et al., 2018) of development. Real-time soil
    nutrient sensing has a huge potential in future agriculture as nutrient leaching
    and groundwater pollution are serious issues people are facing now. Nitrate sensors
    can be fixed to groundwater pumps to monitor the nitrate status of groundwater,
    or installed in leaching water collectors in fields to get reasonable estimation
    about nitrate leaching (Hooper et al., 2019). Soil salinity can be derived from
    the soil''s electrical conductivity (EC), and it was demonstrated three times
    in the literature. This is a very important parameter to measure as soil salinity
    is one of the main soil degrading factors in irrigated agriculture. None of the
    research in the literature highlighted the importance of using EC sensors in soil
    or irrigation systems to ameliorate the soil salinity build-up due to irrigation.
    CO2 and CH4 are greenhouse gases attributed to climate change and agriculture
    is considered a major source of their emission. Accounting for the sourcing and
    sinking of CO2 and CH4 from soil and crops is important to understand the budget
    of greenhouse gases in agriculture. Research suggested that elevation of CO2 can
    increase crop yield as well as improve water use efficiency (Hatfield et al.,
    2011). Therefore, it is essential to measure CO2 and CH4. There are two types
    of gas sensors available. Metal oxide gas sensors increase the electric resistance
    of the sensor when it contacts certain gas. Optical gas sensors measure the absorption
    spectra to detect spectral signatures unique to the gas. O2 sensors can be used
    to monitor the crop respiration rate. Electrochemical sensors can be used to estimate
    dissolved oxygen as the increased dissolved oxygen in water can improve the quality
    and the yield of the aquatic plants (Shi et al., 2018; Ouyang et al., 2020). Another
    interesting parameter to measure is stomatal conductance. Plant stomatal openings
    regulate the exchange of water vapor and CO2 between a leaf and the surrounding
    atmosphere. So far, no IoT-enabled sensor has been developed to measure this parameter
    even though handheld sensors are available (Lamour et al., 2022). Chemical sensors
    can be used to monitor the quality of fruits during harvesting. As an example,
    IoT-enabled Ethelene gas sensors have a huge potential to use in fruit production
    to identify the best time to initiate harvesting (Esser et al., 2012). Although
    chemical sensors improved rapidly in the past decade, applications developed based
    on them in agriculture are still at an early stage. More research is needed to
    incorporate these sensors with Ag-IoT. 3.1.4. Electric sensors Electric sensors
    play a key role in Ag-IoT as they have been used in many industries for a long
    period. The main principle is to measure the change of electrical properties due
    to physical or chemical changes in plants, soil, and the environment. Some electrical
    parameters are charge, current, potential difference, electric field, resistance
    (or conductance), capacitance, and inductance. Soil moisture sensors via IoT systems
    were the most tested sensor in the literature. As most of the agricultural lands
    face water shortages and climate change has heavily affected the water availability,
    most of the studies attempted to address this requirement. We found that electrical
    resistance, capacitance, and permittivity of bulk soils were used to estimate
    soil volumetric water content (VWC). Furthermore, soil water tension was measured
    by the electrical resistance of gypsum blocks. For better irrigation scheduling,
    both VWC and soil water tension are important: VWC quantifies the amount of water
    in the soil whereas soil water tension is a better indicator of how difficult
    plant roots can extract water from the soil matrix. Air temperature and humidity
    sensors are the other two dominant sensors researchers have tested. There are
    three types of humidity sensors: capacitive, resistive, and thermal. Crop ET and
    pest or disease forecasting are the potential applications of the air temperature
    and humidity sensing requirements. But 90% of the research just demonstrated the
    capability of plug play these sensors; only 10% of IoT researchers demonstrate
    the capability of using those sensors for a meaningful task like disease forecasting.
    Humidity is an important environmental parameter directly related to ET calculation,
    crop quality, and pest growth forecasting. Sensors can be deployed to measure
    absolute, relative, and specific humidity. For example, the best time to start
    grain harvesting is highly dependent on grain moisture content and if harvested
    without considering the optimal moisture level it may cause extensive post-harvesting
    damage and economic loss (Zoerb et al., 1993). IoT-based ET modeling and irrigation
    scheduling enable low water usage and low irrigation energy consumption. IoT also
    opened the path for non-conventional VWC measurement. Aroca et al. (2018) presented
    the use of RFID to estimate VWC with a received signal strength of the tag with
    R2 > 0.9. A rain sensor based on the electrical conductivity principle was demonstrated
    as an IoT sensor that could detect the start and end of the rain (Andrey Rivas-Sánchez
    et al., 2019). Based on these literature outcomes it can be concluded that electric
    sensors are mature compared to acoustic and chemical sensors and have been used
    in the industry for a long time and have a wide range of applications in Ag-IoT.
    3.1.5. Mechanical sensors Mechanical sensors convert a physical parameter of interest
    through a mechanical system to an electrical signal. Parameters such as flow rate,
    acceleration, velocity, direction, orientation, and pressure can be measured by
    mechanical sensors. Examples of IoT-enabled mechanical sensors found in the literature
    include rain gauges, mechanical flow meters, air and liquid pressure meters, and
    anemometers. Rain gauge is important to capture the precipitation accurately to
    determine the timing and quantity of irrigation when combined with soil water
    content sensors and evapotranspiration modeling (Kameoka et al., 2017). Tipping
    bucket rain sensor converts water volume it captures to an electrical signal through
    a simple mechanism. Measuring pressure is important for air, liquid, and soil
    pressure calculation. Air pressure is relevant to measure crop transpiration as
    the opening and closing of plant stomata are partially regulated by vapor pressure
    deficit. Soil compaction can be measured by the pressure sensors inserted into
    the soil, which are useful for measuring the impact of heavy agricultural machinery.
    Irrigation line pressure sensors are critical to monitor the irrigation process
    as the wetting pattern of irrigation systems highly depends on the irrigation
    line pressure. High pressure causes loss of irrigation energy while low pressure
    does not allow maximum irrigation area through sprinklers. Anemometers can be
    used to measure the wind speed which is required for calculating ET and detecting
    high-speed wind that could be hazardous to plants. Gas and liquid flow rate are
    significant parameters for crop, soil, and environmental monitoring. Conventionally
    crop and soil inputs in the liquid or gaseous form, such as water input (including
    rain), leaching water, liquid fertilizer, liquid or gaseous insecticides, are
    measured using flow sensors. Some cash crops or niche crops such as wasabi (Sultana
    and Savage, 1970) and lettuce (Sultana and Savage, 1970) need highly precise environmental
    conditions and flow monitoring sensors are important for meeting those conditions
    in the future if climate change imposes challenges to grow them. Overall mechanical
    sensors play a key role in Ag-IoT systems, but most of the mechanical sensors
    are replaced by non-mechanical sensors due to the fact mechanical sensors need
    frequent maintenance and have long response time. 3.1.6. Optical sensors Optical
    measurands play a key role in modern agriculture. There should be a light source
    and an optical sensor to take the measurements. Ultraviolet (UV), visible, and
    near infrared (NIR) are the main wavelength regions where optical sensors are
    operated. It is important to note that optical sensors appear to have the least
    applications as IoT sensors according to the literature. Typical RGB images were
    used to derive RGB image-based vegetation indexes while multispectral sensors
    were used to derive vegetation indexes such as NDVI and NDRE (red-edge NDVI).
    Most of the optical sensors that generate spectral signatures or images of the
    target produce larger volumes of data and consume a higher amount of power compared
    to other sensors in Fig. 3. This appears to be a significant discouraging factor
    to incorporate these sensors into IoT. Naturally, signals in the visible region
    were used as indicators for many crops and environmental parameters such as maturation
    time, crop quality (Long and McCallum, 2015), crop nutrient requirement, pest
    pressure, as well as water and nutrient level in the soil. Historically people
    used their eyes (only responsive to the visible lights) to evaluate the color
    intensities somewhat qualitatively (e.g., comparing those to standard color cards).
    The introduction of these sensors has significantly improved optical measurements
    of crop and environmental parameters by (Akyildiz et al., 2009) enabling quantitative
    assessments and (Alderfasi and Nielsen, 2001) extending the spectral regions from
    visible only to UV and NIR. Fruit spectral signature was used to identify defects
    in the fruit that could not be revealed via visible light. NDVI and NDRE were
    used to quantitatively determine crop density as well as the nitrogen and water
    requirements (Scotford and Miller, 2004). We would like to highlight that more
    research is needed to demonstrate the optical measurand use in Ag-IoT as they
    can be used in a wide range of applications in agriculture. 3.1.7. Thermal sensors
    Thermal measurands have a wide range of applications in Ag-IoT, and most of them
    are measured indirectly with optical and electrical means; for instance, measuring
    crop canopy temperature with infrared radiometers. In the literature, the frequent
    use of air and soil temperature sensors highlighted their importance in crop ET
    modeling and disease forecasting (Symeonaki et al., 2020). These sensors are cheap
    and readily available as off-the-shelf items and support a wide variety of IoT
    platforms (Mohanraj et al., 2016). Thermal parameters have the potential to indirectly
    measure biological measurands. One such example is the sap flow sensor, which
    was described in one study as a transpiration measuring sensor compatible with
    the IoT system (Villalba et al., 2017). The sensor consisted of a flexible tree
    stem heater and a temperature sensor while the IoT platform calculated sap flow
    based on the applied heat and temperature. This sap flow measurement is proportional
    to transpiration (sap movement in the xylem) and therefore useful in crop ET modeling
    (Villalba et al., 2017). Sap flow monitoring is essential in some crops to understand
    the physiological behavior of plants. Rubber, maple, coconut, and palmyra palm
    sap are the output of the harvest, and in these cases, sap flow monitoring is
    useful to estimate yield, optimize production, and develop high-yielding crop
    varieties. Indirectly measured canopy temperature through infrared radiometers
    estimates the transpiration rate and crop water stress index, which is important
    for water stress detection and irrigation scheduling (Alderfasi and Nielsen, 2001).
    Identification of pests such as wild boar through thermal measurement is an interesting
    application in agriculture. Furthermore, the temperature is found to affect the
    quality of grapefruits (sugar content) and flowering time of several crops (Pérez-Expósito
    et al., 2017). Temperature sensors can also record the temperature variation in
    plant leaves and flowering buds and give a warning about frosting time (Barker
    et al., 2017). This listing of thermal measurand applications concluded that thermal
    sensors are very important in Ag-IoT and have been demonstrated in the past literature.
    3.2. Sensing platforms and main control board Section 3.2 summarizes the statistics
    of the Ag-IoT sensing platforms and control boards in the literature. The answer
    for Question 3 in Table 1 was derived from Fig. 4. Download : Download high-res
    image (196KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Main control boards
    of the Ag-IoT systems present in the reviewed papers. 3.2.1. Sensing platforms
    Sensing platforms consist of sensor node including sensors, power supply, energy
    storage, actuators, main control board or the data processing unit, and structural
    components. Structural components determine the sensor node establishment in the
    field. There are two main types of IoT platforms available for crop monitoring.
    Stationery IoT platforms can collect continuous crop data or telemetry data targeting
    a single plant or a group (plot) of plants. The main advantage of stationery IoT
    is the high temporal resolution of the data. Mobile IoT platforms can collect
    data over some areal coverage and with high spatial resolution, but with limited
    temporal resolution. Kumar et al. (2016) presented the development and testing
    of a crop monitoring mobile robot. It is capable of automatically planning the
    path to find crops, recognizing plants using neural networks, applying fertilizer
    timely, and applying water based on the feedback from soil moisture sensors, temperature
    sensors, and humidity sensors. 3.2.2. Main control boards The communication and
    data processing hardware for IoT systems reported in the reviewed papers could
    be broadly categorized into three kinds: commercial platforms, custom build, and
    DIY (do-it-yourself) development boards. The commercial platforms are reliable
    but have limited support for integrating different or additional sensors. IPex12
    (Odin Solutions SL, Peru), Particle Electron (Particle Industries, Inc., USA),
    MICAZ (MICAS AG, Germany), IRIS (IRIS IoT Solutions, UK), and Telosb (Advantic
    Sistemas y Servicios S.L., Spain) are commercial IoT systems. In the last decade,
    commercial IoT platforms were still at their development stage, explaining their
    lower use in the reviewed papers. Custom build hardware is designed by researchers
    based on their own requirements. Researchers have the flexibility to decide on
    the number and types of sensors, interfacing connections, microprocessor clock
    speed, IoT node memory capacity, input voltage, and the communication technology
    used in the node. Furthermore, the technical complexities present in developing
    customized sensor interfacing may also discourage researchers from using commercial
    systems. The custom build hardware platforms have high levels of customization
    but require extensive knowledge of embedded system development to design them.
    DIY platforms are IoT nodes designed based on commercially available development
    platforms, including Arduino, EasyPIC v7, ESP32, Raspberry Pi, and Wapmote. DIY
    development board based IoT systems are popular among researchers because of their
    low cost, high availability, compatibility, and easy programmability. The percentage
    of different hardware platforms used in the reviewed articles is given in Fig.
    4. There were 52 identifiable hardware designs in the list of 115 research. Out
    of them, 29% of the platforms had Arduino only, 8% had Arduino and Raspberry Pi
    hardware jointly, and 2% used Arduino and Arducam hardware together. Ag-IoT research
    was dominated by Arduino-based development systems. Availability, reliability,
    easy programmability, and the option of supporting multiple communication protocols
    made Arduino-based systems popular among Ag-IoT researchers. Raspberry Pi systems
    were demonstrated in 12% of the IoT systems, likely due to their capability of
    capturing images and high computing power compared to Arduino. Selection of the
    IoT platform and the main control board is an important activity in IoT system
    design. The mainboard must support the communication protocols and the power requirement
    (e.g., voltage) of the sensors and actuators. Often voltage and communications
    protocol converters are needed to interface sensors with the main control board.
    Mainboards support three types of digital memories. Volatile memory holds the
    instructions and data of the currently running program until the power is on.
    Volatile memory influences the system''s performance. A larger volatile memory
    is needed for IoT nodes with a large amount of data generated via sensors like
    RGB cameras or spectral sensors. Nonvolatile memory stores data and the program
    when the IoT node power is turned off. The operating system, device identification
    data, and system settings are common data types stored in the nonvolatile memory.
    External nonvolatile memory (e.g., SD cards) can be used to store data or system
    settings, greatly expanding the data storage capability of the Ag-IoT system.
    3.3. Communication technologies and IoT protocols Section 3.3 produces the answers
    to research questions 4 and 5 in Table 1 while discussing findings on the literature
    related to wireless communication technology and IoT protocols. 3.3.1. Wireless
    communication technology Wireless data transmission is a key function of an IoT
    system. To design a successful Ag-IoT system, it is essential to understand the
    radio frequency (RF) contributing factors that impact signal strength, interference,
    system model, bandwidth, and transmission range. Also, understanding of pros and
    cons of wireless communication technologies is essential for a better Ag-IoT device
    selection. Received power (Pr) of wireless data transmission in an unobstructed
    line of sight in a radio signal-free area depends on the transmitter power (Pt),
    transmitter and receiver antenna gains (GTX, GRX), the distance between the transmitter
    and the receiver (R), and the wavelength (λ) of the radio. This relationship is
    expressed in Eq. 1. Therefore, long wavelength radio signals such as LoRa in 900
    MHz are suitable for long-distance data transmission compared to short wavelength
    signals such as Wi-Fi operated in 2.4–3.2 GHz without changing other variables.
    For long-distance communication, the plane earth loss formula is used to account
    for the curvature of Earth for signal strength (Nadir et al., 2008). Equation
    1 Friis transmission equation (Shaw, 2013). Furthermore, radio signals are subject
    to reflection, diffraction, and scattering. These phenomena are illustrated in
    Fig. 5. In open flat agricultural fields, reflection, scattering, and diffraction
    may not occur unless there are large agricultural structures. In hilly areas and
    forests, the effects of wireless signal propagation properties may need special
    attention when placing IoT devices. The Fresnel Zone is the area around the visual
    line-of-sight that radio waves propagate out once they leave the antenna. Blockage
    of Fresnel Zone >40% causes severe signal losses (Tate et al., 2008). Therefore,
    factors such as the height and density of the crop canopies nearby, the presence
    of agricultural structures (e.g., irrigation pivots and storage silos), the locations
    to place IoT nodes, and the antenna height and position are important to account
    for in ensuring the signal transmission quality. In fact, the research on wireless
    communications in rural and agricultural landscapes has raised a lot of interest
    recently (Vuran et al., 2022). The signal quality is also affected by channel
    noise, interference, multipath fading, and attenuation. The success of data transmission
    is measured by a parameter called bit rate error (BRE). Based on the above discussion
    we would like to suggest that it is important to use wireless signal strength
    mapping tools during IoT system installations. Such tools will help to select
    the optimum IoT communication technology (for example, Wi-Fi, LoRa, Mobile Communication)
    suitable for each case, accounting for data transmission rates and signal losses.
    This practice would help farmers to reduce the capital and operational costs involved
    with IoT systems. Download : Download high-res image (63KB) Download : Download

    In the literature, we found that a wide variety of wireless communication technologies
    were used by the researchers. Out of the 35 studies where communication technology
    was clearly mentioned, 34% used Wi-Fi, 17% were conducted using LoRa, and 14%
    used Zigbee. Also 11% of the studies used ethernet or the wired internet connection.
    Less attention was received for mobile communication technologies such as 4G (3%),
    NB-IoT (3%), and GSM (3%). In some cases, researchers used two or more technologies
    to connect different areas in the fields such as LoRa / Wi-Fi, LoRa / TV white
    space (TVWS), and GSM / Zigbee. According to the findings, Wi-Fi and ethernet
    were common in greenhouses while others were favored in outdoor farming practices.

    Fig. 6. Communication technologies in Ag-IoT applications. 3.3.2. IoT protocols
    IoT protocols are data transmission standards that allow communication between
    the endpoint and services with the internet being the common network. IoT protocols
    are broadly classified into two major groups: IoT data protocols and IoT network
    protocols. The data protocols correspond to the application layer whereas network
    protocols correspond to the perception and network layer in the standard IoT architecture
    (Fig. 1). IoT network protocols create networks of device connections. Wi-Fi,
    LoRaWAN, Zigbee, and Bluetooth are such network protocols, and the same term is
    used to represent wireless communication technology. Some common IoT protocols
    are listed in Table 3 with specifications such as frequency, data rate, and range
    (Triantafyllou et al., 2018; Farooq et al., 2019). Table 3. Common IoT Network

    and privacy protection, easy to install and connect, faster data transfers Each
    IoT network protocol/wireless communication technology has its advantages (Table
    3). Bluetooth is a popular short-range wireless communication technology standard
    convenient to create personal area networks. It is possible to use Bluetooth in
    indoor applications such as mobile phone-connected soil water sensors and sensor
    networking in small greenhouses. ZigBee is useful in large indoor growing spaces
    and LoRa is suitable for field crop monitoring senor networks. Cellular technology
    is useful for indoor or outdoor spaces where the network coverage is available.
    Wi-Fi is suitable for both small or large indoor spaces as well as outdoor applications
    where there is infrastructure support available to setup Wi-Fi gateways. Cellular
    and Wi-Fi allow transmitting images, videos, and other larger data files such
    as 3D point cloud data. Bluetooth shares the same advantage but is limited to
    a short distance. Compared to LoRa, Zigbee, and cellular technology, Wi-Fi has
    high reliability in data transmission, but power consumption is high too. All
    these protocols were tested in real crop growing environments (Ferrández-Pastor
    et al., 2016; Codeluppi et al., 2020). 3.4. Cloud platforms and service models
    3.4.1. Cloud platforms Cloud is an essential part of any IoT system. IoT devices
    are not useful without cloud connectivity. Data gathered via individual IoT sensors
    become useful when connected with other relevant sensors. According to the National
    Institute of Standards and Technology, “Cloud computing is a model for enabling
    ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable
    computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services)
    that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or
    service provider interaction” (Mell and Grance, 2011). Essential expected characteristics
    of a cloud system are on-demand self-service, broad network access, resource pooling,
    rapid elasticity, and measured service. Out of the 115 papers we reviewed, only
    25 papers discussed cloud platforms in detail. Among them, 28% of the researchers
    used the ThingSpeak cloud platform developed by MATLAB as the service provider,
    12% used Microsoft Azure, and 12% used Ubidots platform. Furthermore, 12% of the
    researchers built themselves a local data server with the required functionality.
    Google-based Firebase had 8% usage. Other cloud platform service providers including
    Amazon Web Services, cloud sense, generic cloud, sensorDB, SEnviro, and Huawei
    Cloud had 4% use each. The percentage distribution of these cloud platforms is
    given in Fig. 7. Download : Download high-res image (185KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 7. Statistics of cloud service provider selection. 3.4.2.
    Public, private, and hybrid cloud In terms of privacy policies, cloud platforms
    can be divided into three major models: 3.4.2.1. Public cloud Services are offered
    over the public internet and available to anyone who needs to purchase them. Third-party
    cloud service providers own and operate the cloud resources such as servers and
    storage in the public cloud model. Users do not need to spend any capital expenditures
    to scale up; applications can be quickly provisioned and terminated; and users
    pay only for what they use. These are the advantages of the public cloud. Amazon
    Web Services and Microsoft Azure are examples of public cloud services. 3.4.2.2.
    Private cloud A private cloud comprises computing resources used exclusively by
    users from one business or organization therefore hardware must be purchased for
    start-up and maintenance is required. In the private cloud model, infrastructure
    is not shared with users outside the organization. A private cloud can be physically
    placed at a data center owned by the user organization, or it can be hosted by
    a third-party service provider. But the organization has complete control over
    resources and security. 3.4.2.3. Hybrid cloud A hybrid cloud is a computing environment
    that combines a public and a private cloud by allowing data and applications to
    be shared between them. The organizations determine where to run their applications
    while they control security, compliance, or legal requirements. Some organizations
    use a hybrid cloud model to keep sensitive data in the private cloud whereas frontal
    services and web portals are serviced in the public cloud for scalability. Furthermore,
    the public cloud can act as a supporting system if the data and usage exceeds
    the capacity of the private cloud. 3.4.3. Cloud service model Cloud-based services
    provided to the users can be categorized into three major classes based on the
    hierarchy of the service offered. Typical cloud architecture has nine layers.
    They are from bottom to top in order: network, storage, server, virtualization,
    operating system, middleware, runtime, data, and applications. The next section
    will explain cloud service models in detail with hardware and software layers
    they belong. 3.4.3.1. Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) IaaS was the original
    cloud services model. For IaaS, the cloud service provider will provide the hardware
    and keep it up to date, but operating system maintenance and network configuration
    are up to the client. For example, Azure virtual machines are fully operational
    in Microsoft datacenters. The main advantage of the IaaS model is the rapid deployment
    of new computing devices. DigitalOcean, Linode, Rackspace, Amazon Web Services
    (AWS), Cisco Metapod, Google Compute Engine (GCE), and Microsoft Azure are some
    examples of IaaS. 3.4.3.2. Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) In this cloud service
    model, the cloud provider manages the virtual machines and networking resources,
    and the cloud tenant deploys their applications into the managed hosting environment.
    For example, Azure App Services provides a managed hosting environment where developers
    can upload their web applications, without having to worry about the physical
    hardware and software requirements. 3.4.3.3. Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) In the
    case of SaaS, the cloud provider manages all aspects of the application environment,
    such as virtual machines, networking resources, data storage, and applications.
    The cloud tenant only needs to provide their data to the application managed by
    the cloud provider. For example, Microsoft Office 365 provides a fully working
    version of Microsoft Office that runs in the cloud. 3.4.3.4. Network-as-a-Service
    (NaaS) Software-defined networking and software-defined perimeters are services
    that belonged to NaaS. NaaS is a cloud model that enables organizations to easily
    operate the network and achieve the outcomes they expect without owning, building,
    or maintaining their infrastructure through the cloud. NaaS can replace hardware-centric
    VPNs, load balancers, firewall appliances, and Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)
    connections. Users can scale up and scale down as demand changes, rapidly deploy
    services, and eliminate hardware costs. 3.4.4. Fog and edge computing Edge computing
    is the moving of data processing close to where the data is generated. Wireless
    communication-enabled sensors with microcontrollers can be considered edge computing
    devices. The introduction of the edge computing paradigm was due to issues related
    to centralized cloud computing architecture. Data and control signal transmission
    latency and delays in centralized system data analytics are some disadvantages
    of cloud computing. Therefore, network designers proposed architectures where
    the computing power is distributed more evenly around the network. Fog and edge
    computing push the processing capability out to the edge of the network, closer
    to the source of the data. Such techniques are called fog computing and edge computing.
    Fog computing is a computing layer between the cloud and the edge where edge devices
    send large amounts of data to the cloud. The fog computing layer can get the data
    from the edge layer before it reaches the cloud and filter what is relevant and
    what is not. The filtered data gets stored in the cloud, while the unrelated data
    can be deleted, or analyzed at the fog layer for remote access or to use in localized
    learning models. Precision herbicide applications become popular with field crops.
    There, a moving platform that has a camera, carries and applies the herbicide
    at the exact location of the emerging weed. The image processing hardware and
    software in the moving platform do the image processing instantaneously to reduce
    the delay of cloud-based image processing in larger fields (Coleman et al., 2022).
    The centralized cloud-only needs the weed density from the moving IoT platform
    to forecast the future herbicide need to maintain the required quantity in the
    stocks. Therefore, edge computing is all about placing computing power on the
    very edge of the network, on the actual sensors of the device. Low power consumption
    and low processing power microchips or micro-controllers embedded in the devices
    provide the power for edge computing. For that reason, their processing capacity
    is much more limited but sometimes can be adequate to process images (Chamara
    et al., 2021). 3.4.5. Data analytics in IoT Data analytics is one of the most
    important activities in any IoT system, as the decision-making of an IoT system
    depends on hundreds of sensors and events, which is difficult to analyze manually.
    Data generated by IoT devices fall under three categories. They are structured
    data (such as SQL storage), unstructured data (e.g., images and videos), and semi-structured
    data (like social media feeds). Ag-IoT systems can generate both structured and
    unstructured data (Lea, 2020). Stream processing and batch processing are the
    two main types of data processing techniques. Stream processing is useful for
    mobile Ag-IoT platforms since it allows real-time data processing. Batch processing
    can be applied in irrigation, chemigation, and fertigation applications as data
    are processed as a batch to make the decision. Common data analytics activities
    for IoT platforms are listed in Table 4. Below are some examples how they are
    used in Ag-IoT for crop, soil, and microclimate monitoring. Alerting allows growers
    to receive an alert message when soil water use exceeds the maximum allowable
    depletion (Gamon et al., 2015). Sensors in the field environment are susceptible
    to problems like physical damage, pest attack, misalignment, and breakdown, which
    cause errors in data streams. These problems can be effectively alleviated by
    error finding. Using time-series Normalized Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI)
    or Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI) to determine the next irrigation or fertigation
    time belongs to trend analysis. Triggering sprinklers in a field based on SWC
    sensor values is an example of signaling. More complex decisions can be formed
    by combining several analytical activities. For example, in automated crop disease
    detection, an average daily temperature above 20 to 25 °C followed by 1–2 in.
    of rain, together with sugar beet leaf color change indicated a sugar beet pathogen
    outbreak (Wolf and Verreet, 2002). This analysis was enabled by data joining,
    tracking, and trend analysis. Table 4. Data analysis activities commonly found
    in Ag-IoT applications. Data analysis activity Function Preprocessing Filter out
    data with little interest to reduce data complexity and duplication Alerting Raise
    an alert if data exceed certain boundary condition Windowing Apply rules on data
    in a predefined time window Joining Combine multiple data streams into a new single
    data stream Error finding Find missing values and anomalies in data streams Tracking
    Identify when or where an event has occurred Trend analysis Quantify change or
    trend of data as a function of time Signaling Send control signal when a decision
    is made 3.5. Power and energy management Power and energy storage are the two
    major driving forces for IoT systems, especially for Ag-IoT located in remote
    fields. In the literature, we found 3 main categories of power management systems.
    Direct main power connected nodes is the first type and most common with indoor
    applications. A rechargeable battery with a recharging option such as solar, hydro,
    or wind is the second option. The third one has a rechargeable battery or a non-rechargeable
    battery but is designed to consume very low power by sending a very low amount
    of data intermittently. Among the 115 pieces of research we have reviewed, only
    27 of them discussed the IoT system power and energy storage features. Out of
    these 27, 11 platforms used solar power as the main power supply while Lithium
    Polymer (LiPo) rechargeable batteries were used as the energy storage solution.
    Out of 11 indoor farming applications which explained the power management options,
    9 used the main grid power supply. Research that focused on IoT system setup under
    high dense canopies used high power density and high-capacity battery-only solutions
    such as 12 V lead-acid batteries. Two studies mentioned they used battery with
    solar but did not disclose details about the specifications. It revealed that
    there are very limited power supplies available for in-field IoT implementation
    and the findings are highlighted in Fig. 8. Download : Download high-res image

    selection of the Ag-IoT systems in the reviewed studies. Unlike edge-computing
    devices, typical IoT end nodes are designed to be less power-hungry. This power
    consumption goes high due to certain reasons such as connected high throughput
    sensors, significant data processing, and massive data transmission. However,
    these power consumptions can be minimized by exploiting different techniques such
    as the semi-active phase and sleep phase (Zhang and Li, 2019). The edge computing-enabled
    devices need more power. It is essential to standardize the IoT power management
    based on the crop and geographical location of the devices. For example, solar
    power is not a very promising solution for locations with large trees such as
    rubber, pepper, and spices that have a dense crop canopy 5–10 m above the ground
    (Villalba et al., 2017). 3.6. Actuators Monitoring and controlling are two agricultural
    operations closely related to each other. Monitoring by itself is an open-loop
    operation; whereas monitoring, controlling, and again monitoring the effects of
    controlling make a system closed loop and can improve the efficiency of the system.
    Efficient controlling of the actuators based on the monitoring is a key feature
    in the agricultural domain for optimizing inputs, maximizing crop yield and quality,
    and reducing the negative environmental impacts. Fig. 9 depicts the number of
    actuators controlled via IoT systems that were reported in our reviewed papers.
    Out of the 115 studies, 54 mentioned IoT-enabled actuation. Some studies used
    more than one actuator, whereas most of the in-field IoT sensor monitoring systems
    did not mention the use of actuators. Download : Download high-res image (130KB)
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 9. Count of actuators controlled via
    IoT systems found in the reviewed papers. Since water is the largest input by
    volume applied to farms, actuators related to water have been mostly discussed
    in the research work. Such controllers are pumps and solenoid valves. Controlling
    these two actuators were demonstrated in 22 and 8 instances, respectively. After
    irrigation, controlling lighting was the most occurred application in indoor farming
    followed by ventilation, fertigation, alert, and air conditioning. Ventilation
    allows outdoor air to come inside the greenhouse while air conditioning includes
    heating or cooling of the air. Alert meant the system sent an email or message
    to the farmer or the operator of the farm when a parameter exceeded a threshold
    value. An IoT-controlled insect repellent actuator was demonstrated twice among
    the 115 case studies evaluated. Automation of soil bed preparation was achieved
    by utilizing stepper motors in one instance of IoT-based indoor farming. According
    to Figure 9, water pumps and valves were the most frequently used actuators, and
    all these systems were closed loop control systems with soil moisture sensors
    and ET modeling. From the study of the above actuator-related research, it can
    be said that there is enormous potential to automate the controlling of the indoor
    crop''s required environment and soil preparation. (See Fig. 9.) 3.7. Ag-IoT for
    crop monitoring Out of the 115 publications reviewed, 71 systems were demonstrated
    in a real environment. Among them, 65% were implemented in the fields, 24% were
    demonstrated in indoor environments, and 11% were simulations. This is an interesting
    finding that reveals the huge potential of implementing outdoor or in-field IoT
    applications. Typically, it is easy to set up indoor IoT sensor networks due to
    fewer technological barriers, such as extreme environmental conditions and sensor
    connectivity issues. Since real applications were available only in 65% (71 out
    of 115) instances, further real implementations can be done to demonstrate the
    capability of Ag-IoT applications. Considering the 71 systems that demonstrated
    the real applications, 49 were practically demonstrated with certain types of
    crops and 22 did not mention the specific crop they used. 15% of these systems
    were demonstrated with grapes while cereal crops accounted for 26%. One research
    was based on both grapes and oranges. In total 50% of the IoT studies focused
    on perennial specialty crops of higher value including grape, moringa, orange,
    citrus, sugarcane, silver maple, apricot, cashew, and olive (Fig. 10). This result
    indicates that IoT can be implemented with diverse crop types to achieve various
    purposes. Ag-IoT systems are easy to set up on perennial croplands as there is
    less soil preparation for the IoT system installation. It is important to develop
    techniques that allow easy IoT implementation to the annual crops as they contribute
    more to global food security. It is also worth to note only one research demonstrated
    the economic viability of IoT implementation (Chen et al., 2019). Therefore, future
    research to assess and understand the economic viability of IoT applications in
    various situations is needed. Download : Download high-res image (167KB) Download

    crop types. 4. Challenges of Ag-IoT systems and potential solutions Ag-IoT faces
    challenges that are unique compared with IoT applications in other industries.
    In this section, we briefly discuss those challenges that are of utmost importance
    for Ag-IoT system researchers and developers. Ag-IoT challenges can be mainly
    classified into three sections: technical challenges, sectoral challenges, and
    business challenges (Elijah et al., 2018). 4.1. Technical challenges Limitations
    of the advancement of technology are the reasons for technical challenges. They
    would likely be effectively addressed as tools and technologies advance with time.
    The Ag-IoT technical challenges are discussed under the three layers of the IoT
    architecture (Fig. 1), namely, perception layer issues, network layer issues,
    and application layer issues. 4.1.1. Perception layer issues Ag-IoT systems''
    perception layer faces unique challenges, because of the requirements it needs
    to meet during crop and environmental monitoring in harsh environments (Villa-Henriksen
    et al., 2020). Agricultural lands have limited electricity and communication infrastructure.
    It is not practical or cost-effective to use wired power and communication media
    to connect IoT nodes in the field. Therefore, power management, device longevity,
    and ergonomic design are major challenges related to the Ag-IoT perception layer.
    Power management includes Ag-IoT node-level power generation, strategies to reduce
    power consumption, and energy storage. Section 3.5 Power and Energy Management
    revealed that most of the researchers were interested in solar with rechargeable
    batteries as the power source in agriculture. However, there is a challenge to
    introduce suitable power sources for the Ag-IoT systems under the tall and dense
    crop canopy. Micro wind turbines have the potential as an Ag-IoT power source
    but receive less attention in the literature (Jawad et al., 2017). Continuous
    improvements have been made to rechargeable batteries due to the demand for high
    energy to weight ratio batteries. There are several approaches available to reduce
    power consumption. One approach is to select sensors, actuators, and wireless
    protocols with low energy consumption. Selection of a node duty cycle that turns
    the sensor or actuator on when it reads, sends, or receives signals is another
    viable approach (Estrada-Lopez et al., 2018). Harsh environmental conditions such
    as wind and rainfall, continuous high solar radiation, sub-zero temperatures in
    winter, chemicals commonly used in agriculture, and animal attacks make it difficult
    to keep Ag-IoT nodes in the field in operable conditions for a long time (Villa-Henriksen
    et al., 2020). Sensors, cables, and enclosures should be designed to withstand
    such conditions. Standards are available to follow in most cases, but the cost
    becomes high when required standards need to be escalated. Analog signals (Analogue
    voltage or current), Inter-Integrated Circuits (I2C), Serial Data Interface at
    1200 baud rate (SDI-12), and Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (UART)
    are the common sensor to microcontroller data transmission techniques. The microcontroller
    development boards and commercial IoT platforms are designed to work with different
    voltage levels, such as 3.3 V, 5 V, 7 V, and 12 V. These different communication
    protocols and operation voltages have created barriers to the interoperability
    of the devices in Ag-IoT implementation. Research and development to standardize
    data communication and power supply in Ag-IoT systems would substantially increase
    the scalability, upgradability, and interoperability in the perception layer.
    Improving ergonomic design and reducing the labor intensiveness for deploying
    Ag-IoT systems in the field are urgently needed. IoT-based soil water content
    monitoring is a good example to show this issue. Often soil sensors are buried
    underground for continuous measurements during a season. These sensor nodes also
    have an aboveground section to allow wireless communication, which could interfere
    with farm operations such as tillage, fertilizer application, and chemical spraying,
    and should be closely monitored. For annual crops, the need to remove the sensors
    when crops are harvested and reinstall them in the next season represents a significant
    logistic issue for using them effectively. Research on underground wireless communication
    technology (Akyildiz et al., 2009) and Internet of Underground Things (Vuran et
    al., 2018) is ongoing, bearing the promise to alleviate this challenge associated
    with Ag-IoT node installation and maintenance. No standards are currently available
    on Ag-IoT installation as agricultural fields and practices are highly heterogeneous.
    Novel solutions are necessary to encourage Ag-IoT users. 4.1.2. Network layer
    issues The most common Ag-IoT network layer issues are internet coverage, standard
    interception, interference, propagation losses, communication range, wireless
    link quality, network expansion, network management, communication protocols,
    latency, and throughput. As most farms are in rural areas, remote locations, or
    mountain regions, it is a huge challenge to get internet connectivity to them
    since these underpopulated areas have limited internet infrastructure. One solution
    could be creating a local network, a concept similar to a hybrid cloud. This type
    of system does not connect to the internet but still allows local servers to perform
    the basic IoT functionality (Akyildiz et al., 2009). Due to the recent advancement
    in low earth orbit (LEO) satellites, it would soon be possible to have internet
    connectivity via satellite as illustrated in Fig. 11 on a commercial scale (Ivanova
    et al., 2016). Therefore, we anticipate that, in the future, many agricultural
    fields will rely on satellite-based connectivity to connect their gateways to
    the internet. This system consists of a very small aperture terminal (VSAT) type
    ground antenna which is connected to the nodes through multiple gateways. Gateways
    can follow different communication protocols such as Wi-Fi, LoRa, NB-IoT, or Zigbee.
    One disadvantage of satellite-based internet connectivity is that it needs a clear
    sky to make a successful connection. Therefore, it is logical to have a local
    server for data storage and decision-making when the connection is interrupted.

    Fig. 11. Future Ag-IoT system with satellite connected internet. Standard interception
    refers to difficulties in using the full potential of a communication technology
    due to standards imposed by regulatory authorities to limit the use. Recent advancements
    on long-range low throughput communication technologies such as LoRa become widely
    known communication protocols in Ag-IoT. To promote fair use of LoRa bandwidth,
    governments can regulate the use of wireless frequencies. For example, in Europe,
    the duty cycle or the transmitter uptime of the LoRa node is between 0.1% to 10%.
    This is a challenge in most Ag-IoT applications as there are higher volumes of
    data to transmit and many sensors and actuators to connect. When many IoT nodes
    are deployed, the interference may occur because the data transmission could use
    the same frequency, especially in unlicensed spectrums, such as ZigBee, Sigfox,
    LoRa, and Wi-Fi. Signal interference causes data loss and reduces the reliability
    of the systems (Elijah et al., 2018). Wireless signal propagation strength, communication
    range, and wireless link quality depend on the humidity, temperature, crop growth
    status, and crop morphological characteristics in agriculture fields (Tzounis
    et al., 2017; Cama-Pinto et al., 2019; Vuran et al., 2022). Thus, wireless signal
    propagation strength simulation and visualization software are essential in the
    future for the mass installation of Ag-IoT sensor nodes. Such software will reduce
    the complexity of node placement issues. 4.1.3. Application layer issues Data
    security, data privacy, and data analysis are application layer issues. Ag-IoT
    data is important for a country''s food security as well as for the Ag business
    model security. In the modern competitive world, data breaching could lead to
    a competitive disadvantage on Ag-business model over a competitor as well as risk
    the food security of a country. Therefore, more focus should be put into improving
    the security and privacy of data generated via Ag-IoT systems. 4.2. Sectoral challenges
    4.2.1. Regulatory issues Data ownership creates another business challenge. Companies
    that provide Ag-IoT services can use the data for improvements in their systems,
    but farmers do not receive compensation for that. There is a challenge to implement
    such a system to prevent data monopoly (Misra et al., 2020). Therefore, regulation
    and legal frameworks about the control and rights of data between farmers and
    IoT companies need to be established (Elijah et al., 2018). 4.2.2. Interoperability
    issue According to Elijah et al. (2018), interoperability involves the ability
    to have technical, synthetic, semantic, and organization interoperability. Technical
    interoperability involves the effortless communication among IoT devices using
    protocols. Data interchanging between systems is semantic interoperability. Synthetic
    interoperability deals with IoT system-generated digital data exchange with humans,
    while organization interoperability involves information sharing among different
    regions, infrastructures, and cultures (Elijah et al., 2018). Here we would like
    to introduce a challenge associated with Ag-IoT system interoperability. As most
    of the farmers have crop rotations and multi-cropping systems, it is essential
    to have Ag-IoT systems with context awareness that allows them to work with different
    cropping systems. The heterogeneity of agricultural systems imposes the system
    interoperability challenge. 4.2.3. Business issues The cost and non-availability
    of skilled personnel in Ag-IoT is a business issue. Cost is a challenge for Ag-IoT
    implementation. There are three types of costs involved with Ag-IoT systems: the
    setup cost or the capital expenditure, running cost or operational cost, and upgrading
    cost. Due to the nature of IoT business models and being a relatively new technology,
    analysis on return on investment of Ag-IoT systems is not yet discussed considerably
    in the literature. Chen et al. (2019) highlighted that application of IoT systems
    on irrigation controlling in turmeric turned out to be profitable. Several factors
    increase capital expenditure. Remote and harsh environmental conditions that Ag-IoT
    systems must bear increase the production cost of Ag-IoT systems. Ag-IoT end nodes
    require materials that do not wear and tear due to sun, rain, and chemicals applied
    during crop cultivation. Communication cost is usually a standard rate, but the
    initial investment is required to set up the internet connection, and this cost
    depends on the infrastructure availability where the farms are located. Theoretical
    knowledge and practical experience about the sensing/actuating system and parameters
    of interest are essential to set up a successful Ag-IoT system. Sensor data interpreters
    need an overall understanding of the agroecological principles to reach a decision
    (Duff et al., 2022). Reluctance to use new technology and unskilled manpower are
    apparent obstacles to implementing Ag-IoT in commercial production crop monitoring
    systems. More extension programs are needed to solve this issue while standards
    are necessary for Ag-IoT system development to improve the common Ag-IoT platforms
    that have interoperable qualities. 5. Supporting technologies 5.1. Augmented reality
    and IoT applications Data visualization and real-time decision-making are important
    to IoT. Based on past literature this sector is the least explored area. Wearable
    augmentation devices improve crop monitoring and control. Smart glasses have the
    real-time data visualization capability to indicate the status of crops, soil,
    or environment (Hurst et al., 2021). An irrigation activity can be controlled
    manually by a farmer if he can visualize the real-time soil water content change
    in the field. The conditions within a greenhouse can be controlled in real-time
    and actuators can be controlled via voice command through a smart glass. Harvesting
    can be more enjoyable and more efficient (lower loss) based on image processing
    capable smart glasses. Vegetable or fruit pickers can be assisted through a smart
    glass by viewing what it detects in the fruit to decide whether to pick it or
    not. Untrained labor usage-related losses can be reduced by augmented reality
    related training. 5.2. Big data Big data generated by Ag-IoT are mostly of heterogeneous
    types. The most common IoT agricultural big data are machine-generated data (Wolfert
    et al., 2017). These data are generated from a massive number of sensors and smart
    machines used to measure and record farming processes; which are in turn boosted
    by the IoT. Machine-generated data range from simple sensor records to complex
    computer logs. Big data in agriculture are generated mostly when we introduce
    smart sensing and monitoring with the help of IoT. The main sources of big data
    in Ag-IoT are: sensors, robotics, open data, data captured by airborne sensors
    (Faulkner and Cebul, 2014; Cole et al., 2012), weather/climate data, yield data,
    soil types, agricultural census data (Chen et al., 2014) and so on. Typically,
    telemetry data is generated by sensors such as temperature, rotary, or linear
    encoder. These data are well-structured in contrast to imagery data which need
    post-processing. Such unstructured data have issues in terms of availability,
    quality, and formats (Liu et al., 2015) and can be a concern. As the number of
    sensors is increasing and data volumes are growing rapidly, it is becoming a matter
    of utmost importance to store and process big data. Some approaches to handle
    big data are data shrinking, scale up, scale out, and high-performance computing.
    Data shrinking is the process of throwing away some less important data and still
    being able to reconstruct the original data. Scale-up (vertical scalability) is
    adding additional storage and RAM to store and process the big data in the processing
    node. But this technique has its capacity limit. Scale out (horizontal scalability)
    is the concept of using parallel computers to store and process that big data.
    High-Performance Computing is one of the state-of-the-art techniques to handle
    big data, where computers with multiple cores are grouped to create an efficient
    network to deal with the big data. These techniques are essential for successful
    data handling in Ag-IoT. 5.3. Artificial intelligence in Ag-IoT Techniques that
    enable machines to mimic human behavior are artificial intelligence (AI), while
    a subset of AI that gives machines the ability of learning without being explicitly
    programmed is machine learning. Deep learning techniques are a subset of machine
    learning techniques with multilayer neural network feasibility. The data generated
    from the Ag-IoTs are often used to train machine learning models for specific
    agricultural use cases such as yield forecast, crop stress detection, and pest
    spreading prediction. To be more specific, for the agricultural IoT applications,
    raw sensing information such as field and weather conditions and crop status can
    be collected and used for model training locally or in the remote end that has
    more computational resources. These trained models can later be used to control
    actuators for variable rate irrigation and site-specific pesticide/ herbicide
    applications. Deep learning techniques are heavily used with image processing
    applications in agriculture. Trained deep learning models are available for crop
    type detection (de Filho et al., 2020), plant phenotyping (Pound et al., 2017),
    fruit (Patel et al., 2011), flower (Dias et al., 2018), and leaf detection (Chamara
    et al., 2021), and weed detection for herbicide applications (Coleman et al.,
    2022). AI becomes an integral part of IoT due to its capability of using it as
    a data analytics tool. 6. Ag-IoT for farming systems analyses and management In
    this section, we briefly discuss and envision how Ag-IoT would benefit and potentially
    transform farming systems analyses and management, enabled by its unprecedented
    data, analytics, and connected sensors and actuators. Perhaps the most obvious
    advantages of Ag-IoT come from the high spatiotemporal resolution of farm-level
    data it generates concerning crops, soil, and microclimate (Kagan et al., 2022).
    The high spatial resolution data would quantify the the spatial variability of
    crop parameters (such as yield and leaf area index) and soil parameters (such
    as pH, organic matter, and water holding capacility), and elucidate the relationships
    between them to identify yield-limiting factors at different parts of the field
    (Alfred et al., 2021). This is the underlying principle of site-specific crop
    management, which will be greatly enhanced through Ag-IoT. Modern Ag-IoTs take
    measurements at hourly and sub-hourly intervals. This high temporal resolution
    data allow us to observe the crop responses to environmental cues at finer time
    steps, and enhance our understanding on how basic plant physiological processes
    such as transpiration and photosynthesis vary due to short-term environmental
    fluctuations. Process-based crop and soil models, which are widely used to evaluate
    the economic and environmental consequences of farming practices, usually suffer
    from the lack of site-specific data to parameterize and calibrate them, especially
    the in-season crop data and soil data. These data are exactly what Ag-IoT sensors
    are good at generating, and therefore would improve the accuracy of these models
    for farm-level management assessment. Networked sensors and actuators of Ag-IoT,
    along with the real-time data processing, transmission, and modeling, would greatly
    improve the decision-making cycle of farm-level management practices (Chaterji
    et al., 2021). The traditional crop management decision-making has several limitations.
    First, the decision is usually based on a single set of data, because other datasets
    are unavailable or expensive to obtain. Second, there is usually long latency
    between data generation and decision-making (e.g., several days or weeks). This
    long latency is in contrast to the fact that many stresses in the field (such
    as pest outbreak) occur and develop quickly and need real-time intervention to
    prevent substantial loss. Thirdly, the present management practice only addresses
    one factor at a time whereas in reality crops can undergo multiple stresses simultaneously.
    Altogether, these limitations reflect our inability to capture the complexity
    of the farming system. Ag-IoT has the potential to transform farm-level decision-making
    by enabling multi-inputs, multi-outputs decision strategies, powered by real-time
    data processing and relevant models run in the cloud to shorten the latency. For
    example, crop, soil, and microclimate sensors can simultaneously measure the crop
    water and nitrogen status, soil moisture content and nitrate content, and weather
    variables. These multi-source inputs can be fed into the models to output two
    variables: a nitrogen sufficiency index and a water sufficiency index. These two
    variables can further be converted to a nitrogen and water application rate for
    site-specific fertigation. This paradigm has several advantages. First, it is
    a multi-inputs, multi-outputs decision strategy that accounts for the interaction
    between the water and nitrogen stresses. Second, it reduces the cost of implementation
    and shortens the management cycle because two actions are combined into one (one
    pass of field equipment instead of two). In a similar fashion, decisions such
    as pesticide applications and other chemicals (fungicides, growth regulators)
    could potentially be further stacked to make crop production more efficient. Traditionally,
    farm system analyses and management happen at the individual farm level (Köksal
    and Tekinerdogan, 2019). In other words, data are usually not shared or co-analyzed
    across the farm boundary. In the era of Ag-IoT where farm data are shared and
    stored in the cloud, there represents an opportunity where the analysis and modeling
    of Ag-IoT data can cover a group of farms or at a regional scale. These regional
    analyses would answer other important questions such as regional yield forecasting,
    pest tracking, or agricultural resource prioritization. These questions are not
    necessarily important for individual growers, but are at the heart of other stakeholders
    such as policy makers and input suppliers. Data ownership and privacy, covered
    in Section 4, are two big issues that should be resolved before this type of analysis
    may occur. 7. Conclusions and future directions 7.1. Conclusions Ag-IoT is a promising
    technology that would increase resource use efficiency in agricultural systems,
    and is an essential tool for digital agriculture transformation. In this paper,
    we have overviewed impactful research related to Ag-IoT in the past decade. The
    data collected from these papers were categorized and analyzed under six main
    Ag-IoT system design parameters namely sensors, sensing platforms and main control
    board, communication technology and IoT protocols, cloud platforms, power and
    energy management, and actuators. According to the analyzed data, it is revealed
    that there is an increased global attention towards the Ag-IoT system-related
    research in the recent years. However, there are certain research gaps found in
    the literature. One of them is that the implementations of the sensors and the
    actuators seem to be limited to soil and environmental parameter monitoring and
    irrigation controlling. Furthermore, crop macro and micronutrient demand analyses
    are still at the infant stage due to the non-availability of sensors that can
    measure nutrients in real-time. Therefore, it is essential to improve the sensor
    and actuator applications in crop monitoring and controlling. In addition, heterogeneity
    of the system parameters (such as data, platforms, required power) is a major
    challenge to the Ag-IoT systems implementation, to which the improvement of the
    context-awareness could be a solution. Power harness options for Ag-IoT nodes
    need more exploration as there are limited options available and it would be a
    big advantage for the perennial crop monitoring. The perception and the network
    layers of Ag-IoT systems require more improvements to meet the sensor implementation
    ergonomics and long-range high-throughput data transmission, respectively. Edge
    computing can be a replacement of the high throughput long-range communication,
    but to the best of our knowledge, only a limited number of practical applications
    have been developed based on edge computing to date. Mobile Ag-IoT platforms such
    as unmanned aerial and ground vehicles have a huge potential to increase the spatiotemporal
    resolution in Ag-IoT-based monitoring and controlling. 7.2. Future directions
    From the finding of this review, authors would like to highlight some important
    future requirements for Ag-IoT. The entire Ag-IoT research community needs to
    propose a complete system design for Ag-IoT that will be viable, open, and interpretable.
    The objective is to enable the interconnectivity of heterogeneous systems and
    sharing resources to obtain more detailed and specific agricultural data. Furthermore,
    in the future research work, there is a need to develop complete information perception
    standards and design multi-protocol compatible gateways. With some significant
    efforts in the above-mentioned future research directions, the entire research
    community will be able to solve the problems of inconsistent device interfaces
    and protocols, making the system faster, robust, and more convenient. Making full
    use of long-range low throughput communication technology, virtual reality/augmented
    reality, and big data/AI for Ag-IoT is yet to be thoroughly explored. Declaration

    India SECTION I. Introduction Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is a combination
    of various sensor nodes. Each sensor node in a network is integrated with transceiver
    and receiver for sending and receiving data. WSNs is classified into two types
    i.e. structured WSNs and unstructured WSNs [1]. In structured WSNs, sensor nodes
    are deployed in a well-defined manner, whereas in unstructured WSNs, the sensor
    nodes are deployed in randomly order. WSNs have large number of applications in
    real world scenario like military, airlines, underwater survey, agriculture, healthcare,
    transportation and many more. The different communication technologies are developed
    for communication between nodes and base station such as ZigBee, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi,
    GSM/GPRS, and LoWPAN. In present time WSNs are widely adopted in diverse of field
    such as precision agriculture, health, transportation, monitoring, tracking, security
    system etc. The monitoring applications can be described as field''s surveillance,
    environmental conditions, water level, body organs status etc., while tracking
    applications can be described in terms of animal detection in agriculture, intruders
    in restricted area, and disease in human body. It is noticed that agriculture
    has a significant impact on human life as well as for wealth creation. It is also
    observed that agriculture sector is one of important component in the economy
    of many countries. But, it is observed that farmers are faced different issues
    with respect to agriculture. These issues are summarized as less information regarding
    crops, irrigation environmental parameter for crops, intruders etc. The precision
    agriculture (PA) is a promising solution for the aforementioned problems as well
    as better production and protection of crops. The solution of aforementioned issues
    is precision agriculture (PA). Further, it can be described as management of the
    crop that includes different technologies such as IoT, WSN, drone surveillance,
    water management, remote sensing etc. In agriculture, WSNs plays vital role the
    sensor nodes deploy in agriculture field sense the moisture of soil, temperature
    of surrounding, content of water present in the field, requirement of water in
    field, detection of intrusion in farms and requirement of fertilizers. By using
    WSNs in agriculture sector wastage of many resources like water, fertilizer, man
    work power, management and farming cost are reduced. By using sensor nodes in
    agricultural field farmers can easily: Study the soil condition. Get real time
    information. Provide smart irrigation. Analyse growth of plant. Detection of intrusion
    in field. Furthermore, several techniques are considered for achieving the precision
    agriculture. These techniques are storage, perception, transmission, process and
    control. The role of precision agriculture is twofold- (i) optimizing the production
    and (ii) maximum profitability. First point can be achieved by considering the
    uncertainties and variability. While, second is achieved through reduction in
    fertilizers and environmental issues. The aforementioned techniques are integrated
    to design the sensing system. Such system contains several actuators and sensors
    to determine various environmental impacts for PA. These sensors also gather the
    data in real time scenario form agriculture field. The collected data includes
    several real time information such as EC, temperature, humidity, luminance and
    PH. WSNs is adopted for transmitting such information and AI techniques are considered
    for analyzing the collected information. In turn, useful information is retrieved
    from collected data regarding the growth of crops. Fig. 1 illustrates the sensor
    nodes deployment in the agriculture field and its working. The real time data
    is collected through different sensors and it is sent to users with the help of
    global network. Initially, data is collected on the sink node through different
    sensor nodes using communication technologies such Wi-Fi and ZigBee etc., and
    further, transferred to base station. In this work, a WSNs based model is developed
    for measuring the environmental parameters and collect real time information of
    rose plants. The proposed model is tested for the period of three months to measure
    the growth of rose crop. Rest of paper is arranged as section II presents the
    recent works on WSNs in precision agriculture. Section III discusses the proposed
    system for achieving precision agriculture. The results are discussed into section
    IV. Section V conclude the outcome of the proposed work. SECTION II. Related Works
    This section describes the recent works reported on PA using WSNs. To monitor
    agriculture field, Sanchez et al. [2] developed an integrated model for video
    surveillance to detect intruders as well as monitoring of crops. For preventing
    crops from animal attacks, Bapat et al. [3] proposed a cost effective WSNs based
    system which is integrated with PIR sensors, RF module, sound producing devices
    and light flashers. Nikolidakis et al. [4] developed an energy efficient system
    based on ECHERP protocol for smart irrigation in agricultural fields. To reduce
    the wastage of water in agricultural fields, Gutierrez et al. [5] designed an
    automatic irrigation system based on WSNs and GPRS module which is feasible and
    cost effective. For collecting real time information of agricultural fields, Zhang
    et al. [6] developed a remote monitoring system based on WSNs by using ZigBee
    communication technology. To monitor the soil property of field, Li et al. [7]
    developed a system which is based on WSNs. The designed system helps in providing
    real time field data to the users. Jahnavi et al. [8] developed an automatic system
    for measuring the environmental parameters in a greenhouse. The system is integrated
    with various hardware components like CC2530 chip, ZigBee stack, Humidity sensor,
    Temperature sensor and soil moisture sensor. To monitor greenhouse vegetables
    by WSNs, Li et al. [9] proposed a monitoring system using JN5139 micro- processor,
    Zigbee, ARM7 microprocessor, ZKOS operating system. For real time frost monitoring
    in vineyard, Valente et al. [10] designed a collaborative system made up of WSNs
    and aerial robot. The proposed system assesses the viability of frost in spring
    season. For better agricultural production, Keshtgari et al. [11] provides WSNs
    based solution for precision agriculture. The proposed system is composed of sensor
    nodes which collect real time information of field and by using Zigbee communication
    technology data is transferred. Liu et al. [12] proposed a WSNs based prototype
    to monitor the environmental condition of greenhouse. By using several sensor
    nodes temperature, moisture of soil and light condition were measured and with
    the help of GSM module data is remotely transmitted to the users system. To investigate
    the effects of environmental conditions in a greenhouse, Mendez et al. [13] designed
    a Wi-Fi based agricultural monitoring system. Proposed system monitors various
    environmental parameters like temperature, humidity and the information was transmitted
    to the users by using Wi-Fi communication technology. For precision agriculture,
    Lin et al. [14] reported a WSNs based model chip model for monitoring and Zigbee
    for data communication. The proposed system was constituted by three parts that
    are sensing unit for collecting environmental parameters, Zigbee transceiver for
    data communication and web-site unit by which remotely users can access data.
    WSNs based model is adopted for measuring the progression in valeriana jatamansi
    plant [15]. Akhter and Sofi presented explored the capabilities of WSNs, data
    analytics and machine learning for achieving the precision agriculture [16]. Anguraj
    et al. presented a CNSVMHC for the effective management of irrigation issue [17].
    It''s claimed that proposed classifier get rid off the weekly irrigation and plant
    can be irrigated on the bases of moisture content of soil in automatic manner.
    Moreover, a control mechanism is also developed to stop the irrigation process.
    Sanjeevi et al. presented a WSNs based architecture to monitor and investigate
    the growth of plants using IoT devices for PA and remote farming [18]. The irrigation
    issues is effectively handled through different IoT devices. The results claimed
    that proposed architecture achieves at par results than conventional model. This
    study presented a prediction model for apple orchids and task of the prediction
    model is to find the disease in apples. In this work, different environmental
    parameters are measured which are responsible for the growth of valeriana jatamansi
    plant. Fig. 1: Sensor nodes in agricultural field Show All SECTION III. Propsoed
    Model for Precision Agriculture (pa) This section describes the various hardware
    and software requirements for the proposed model. • Node Hardware The proposed
    system for PA consists of variety of hardware''s that are integrated on a single
    platform and works simultaneously. The proposed system is the combination of variety
    of sensors like temperature, soil, PIR, humidity, Arduino board, water pump, Wi-Fi
    and breadboard. Fig. 2 illustrates the model of proposed system. • Arduino Board
    It is open source platform that can be adopted for integrating the different electronic
    and IoT devices. The aim of this platform is to send and receive the data through
    different sensors. This platform is operate on 5 volt and contains ATmega 328
    microcontroller. It consists of fourteen digital pins that are connected to different
    IoT devices. These pins are illustrated in Fig. 3. USB socket (1): It connects
    the Arduino board with computer to embed code. Fig. 2: Illustrates the proposed
    system for pa Show All Microcontroller (2): This work considers the ATmega328
    microcontroller to send and receive data. Barrel jack (3): It provides the power
    to Arduino board. Reset Button (4): It can be used to erase all embedded code.
    Voltage regulator (5): It controls the power to Arduino board. Power pins (6,
    7): regulates the voltages. GND (8): Describes as ground circuit. Analog pins
    (9): used to read the data and can be described through A0-A5. • Digital pins
    (10): These pins can be used for digital information and described through 0 to
    13. Fig. 3: Arduino uno board Show All • Temperature and Humidity Sensor The proposed
    system consists of DHT11 sensor and this sensor is used to measure the temperature
    and humidity. The reason behind the selection of DHT 11 over linear temperature
    sensor because it provides the temperature in Celsius rather than Kelvin and its
    can be measured the temperature in the range of −40°c to 110°c. The minimum voltage
    for this sensor is 3V, but this sensor works better at 5V. Furthermore, it consists
    of V CC , Data and GND pins. The voltage supply is controlled through V CC pin
    and set to 5V. The results are provided through data pin and ground the circuit
    through GND pin. • Soil Moisture Sensor The task of this sensor is to determine
    the water content in the soil based on electrical conductivity. This sensor is
    worked on the resistance principle. This principle stated that amount of water
    content depends on the resistance among two different location in the soil. The
    lower value of resistance directly proportional to higher water content. The working
    of moisture sensor is described through two parts such as probe and circuit. Probe
    consists of two metal rods separated through a block of foam. Further, probes
    insert into the soil for measuring the water content and it can be measured using
    flow of current which passes through probes and compute the total resistance for
    measuring the water content. Circuit board consists of several different devices
    such as power LED, LM293 comparator, potentiometer, output and 4 pins. The significance
    of LM293 comparator is to provide single supply over different voltage range.
    Potentiometer can be acted as voltage divider in soil moisture sensor. The four
    pins are VCC, GND, A 0 , and D 0 . The voltage is regulated through VCC and it
    requires 5V. GND pin can be described as ground the circuit and connected to Arduino
    board. The analog data is transferred through A 0 to A 1 Arduino board and digital
    data is transferred through Do. • Pir Sensor It is passive infrared sensor that
    can be responsible to detect the intruders in agriculture land. This task is accomplished
    through HC-SR501 sensor. This sensor is operated in the range of 5V-20V and consists
    of three pins. These are Vcc , GND, OUT; V cc is for voltage supply, Ground sensor
    is through GND and output is obtained through OUT pin. • Water Pump The irrigation
    task in agriculture land is accomplished through water pump. The proposed system
    also contains a mechanism for water pump and consists of two pins for this task
    such as V CC and GND. V CC requires 3v to connect the Arduino and ground the circuit
    through GND pin. The water pump can be started automatic manner on the basis of
    environmental reading and stopped after achieving the threshold value. • Wi-Fi
    Module This work considers the Wi-Fi module to send the collected data from agriculture
    land to remote users. The proposed system consists of ESP8266 Wi-Fi module and
    having four pins. These are R X , T X , CH and V CC The data is received through
    R X pin and transferred through T X pin. V CC is responsible for voltage supply
    and control. • Breadboard It is electronic device responsible for connecting the
    different IoT devices of the proposed system. These devices are connected to breadboard
    through holes. Further, it is noticed that Arduino board consists of three pins,
    one for voltage supply and rest of are GND. So, each sensor cannot connect to
    Arduino board, hence breadboard is considered. • Working Procedure The working
    behavior of proposed system is demonstrated into Fig. 4. It is seen that different
    IoT and electronic devices are integrated into Arduino board to get the real time
    information. Furthermore, to avoid interrupted power to sensors, a Breadboard
    is integrated with sensing system. The continuous power supply is maintained through
    5V pin of Arduino board. It is also noted that only two pins are presented on
    the Arduino board. Hence, it is quite complicated task to connect all sensors
    with Arduino board. In turn, these sensors are connected to Arduino board with
    the help of breadboard. Moreover, the desired voltage is obtained through inserting
    the V CC pin of DHT11 sensor in breadboard hole. The digital data received and
    transferred through data pin and it is connected to Arduino D 13 pin. The connection
    of GND pin is same row in breadboard and Arduino board. Moreover, soil moisture
    sensor also requires the power supply for measuring the water content and it is
    connected to Arduino board through breadboard using V CC pin. The analog data
    is collected by connecting A 0 and A 1 pin of Arduino board. The similar process
    is adopted in case of PIR sensor. The digital data is collected through OUT pin
    of PIR sensor and D 2 p in of Arduino board. For receiving and transmitting of
    the data, R X and T X pins of ESP-8266 sensor are connected to D 0 and D 1 pins
    of Arduino board. CH and V CC pins are connected with 3.3V pin of Arduino board.
    Water pump is also connected to Arduino board through breadboard using V CC and
    GND pins. Finally, the system diagram consists of variety of sensors like DHT11,
    PIR sensor, Wi-Fi module, Water pump, Soil moisture sensor and battery that are
    integrated on Arduino board. Further, Arduino 1.8.5 software installed to set
    the respective pin with different sensors. The working of the pins are started
    with void setup () and void loop () functions. It the soil moisture is less than
    20, then water pump starts in automatic manner and it is stopped if moisture level
    is 90. Using Wi-Fi module, all processed data is sent to cloud layer. SECTION
    IV. Experimental Results The proposed model is used to monitor the growth of rose
    plant and deployed in a real world greenhouse which is depicted in Fig. 5. Initially,
    the performance of the proposed model is over three months such as to collect
    the real time data of moisture, intruders and irrigation. Fig. 6 illustrates the
    nodes deployment in the rose greenhouse, and the soil moisture sensor deployment.
    The sensing range of water content insoil is set to 5m. The water pump can be
    strated in automatic manner, if moistures in soil less than 20 and stopped until
    it cannot reached upto 90. Fig. 7(a) depicts the smart irrigation for the rose
    plants. To achieve the same, a arrow dipper is used with the waterpump to gives
    the water to rose plants. The real time information of intrusion or occurence
    of animal or insects near the rose plant is detected through PIR sensor. Fig.
    7(b) shows the deployment of the PIR sensor in rose green house and the range
    of these sensor is set to 10 meters. Further, a Wi-Fi communication technology
    is used to transmit the data from rose green house to user. In the proposed system
    ESP-8266 Wi-Fi module is used and it can be illustarted in Fig. 7(c). The real
    time information of the the rose greenhouse is collected on base station with
    the help of ESP-8266. Fig. 4: System diagram of proposed pa model Show All Fig.

    Discussion The proposed model is installed in a greenhouse for a time period of
    three months. Further, real time data is collected and sent to user with the help
    of Wi-Fi module. In this subsection, few real time reading of the proposed model
    is described. Fig. 8 shows the real time collected through the proposed model
    for rose''s plants. The collected data is not readable for remote users. This
    data is converted into. CSV file using some python scripts. The python script
    which is used for this conversion is shown in Fig. 9. This data can easily read
    through the remote users. Further, some sample data of rose greenhouse is used
    to illustrate the temperature readings, moisture content, and detection of motion
    and humidity level of rose plant using Figs. 10–13. Fig. 10 depicts the moisture
    content of soil for rose plants. It is noticed that on day 4, the moisture content
    is below than significant level. Hence, to maintain the moisture level in rose
    green house, water pump is automatically start and it works until the moisture
    level is not reached up to 90. In proposed model, if the moisture of soil less
    than 20, water pump starts automatically and works up to 90. The reading of the
    PIR sensor to detect the motion in the rose greenhouse is illustrated in Fig.
    11. The PIR sensor can detect the motion in binary form. If motion is detected,
    then it is represented using 1 otherwise 0. It is observed that through PIR sensor,
    user can easily get the information about intrusion detection in the greenhouse.
    Figs. 12–13 illustrates humidity and temperature reading using proposed system.

    presents a prototype model for rose crops. The proposed model incorporates different
    hardware''s and software entities to achieve the precision agriculture, smart
    irrigation and intrusion detection. The proposed model is implemented in rose
    crops to monitor the growth of plants, smart irrigation and intrusion detection.

    environmental parameters such as moisture content, humidity level, temperature
    etc. The designed system also sends the collected information to remote users.
    Smart irrigation feature is also incorporated in the proposed system to reduce
    the water wastage. It is also observed that PIR sensors can be used for the detection
    of intruders near the rose field. Further, the collected information is sent to

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Wellington, New Zealand SECTION I. Introduction
    The Food and Agricultural Organization estimates that food production must increase
    by 60 % to feed the 9.8 Billion humans on the globe by 2050 [1]. However, agricultural
    land is already covering 38 % of the overall emerged land world-wide, and modern
    agriculture uses harmful environmental methods [2]. For example: the intense usage
    of chemicals resources that are present in low quantity on earth and pollute the
    soil and water stocks while destroying the biodiversity [3]; the usage of oil
    hungry heavy machinery that accelerates soil compaction [4]; the massive needs
    for irrigation water that dry up groundwater supply [5]. To change how humanity
    produces food, researchers have brought numerous new tools using Information and
    Communication Technologies (ICT) to the farm fields, creating a new research domain
    called Smart Farming (SF). SF, also called Precision Agriculture (PA), uses data
    produced by wireless sensor networks (WSN) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to
    understand better the environment and its interaction with crops and livestock
    to make food more efficient with fewer resources [6]. In this domain, Artificial
    Intelligence (AI) powered Computer Vision algorithms are of particular interest
    as they can, for example, identify a plant''s different stages of growth to detect
    specific situations such as disease development, pest attack, or fruit maturity.
    This knowledge is crucial as it allows the farmers to take the necessary actions
    in time (Crop thinning, fertilizer application, call for harvest, etc.) [7]. Unfortunately,
    such algorithms require significant processing power. Thus such programs are usually
    performed in the cloud and not directly on the device taking the picture [8].
    However, sensors in the Agricultural domain mainly use Low Power Wide Area Network
    (LPWAN) to transmit data to save battery lifetime [9]. Those type of network allows
    transmission over long distances at minimal energy cost but with a reduced data
    throughput, making difficult the communication of heavy files such as images[10].
    To avoid relying on the cloud for image analysis, researchers have looked into
    bringing the computation of AI algorithm directly to the end device with constraint
    hardware. Those techniques are called embedded AI or Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML)
    [11]. Performing the AI computing task on the device allows the vision sensor
    to communicate only the result in small messages through LPWAN, saving battery
    life while increasing privacy and security and reducing the latency [12]. Despite
    promising results, TinyML methods only allow the end device to perform inference
    on its hardware and are not able to learn and evolve after its deployment into
    a specific environment. Therefore Smart Edge Devices need to be updated frequently
    to ensure their accuracy [13]. However, as said previously, WSNs in agriculture
    are deployed over vast geographical areas making it challenging to update devices
    through wired connections requiring remote updating. The Firmware Update Over
    The Air (FUOTA) problem is well known in the IoT field as every device will probably
    need bug fixes and security maintenance while deployed [14]. Multiple researchers
    have also studied its feasibility for LPWAN network [15] as their characteristics
    regarding data throughput and regulations involve extra layers of complexity to
    take into account. In this paper, we propose a study of the FUOTA process for
    LoRaWAN network as it is a widely used network in agriculture applications [16].
    We then analyze its usage in the context of a TinyML firmware update. Afterward,
    we build a prototype of an intelligent sensor using TinyML for fruit presence
    detection communicating its result through a LoRaWAN network for energy saving.
    The sensor feedback will let the farmer know when and where fruits are present
    to take the necessary actions (harvest, fertilizer application, etc.). After deploying
    the first model in a specific environment, we train a new model and perform a
    FUOTA with LoRaWAN to validate the feasibility of the process. Finally, we study
    the energy consumption of our prototype and the packet delivery ratio in different
    network scenarios. SECTION II. State of the Art A. Firmware Update for Internet
    of Things Devices IoT Technologies are being used exponentially in every domain
    of modern life, and as related protocols and applications evolve, the need for
    firmware updates also [17]. An update allows a developer to add functionalities
    to the IoT devices after deployment, fix bugs, and patch security issues. Good
    surveys on fundamental principles and programming techniques of an IoT device
    firmware update process have been made by the authors in [18] and [19]. Key points
    of the IoT Firmware Update process are: Over the Air: Devices are spread over
    various geo-graphical areas and might be difficult to reach. The update process
    must be performed wirelessly. In the agricultural domain, we talk about hundreds
    of devices in vast crops field [6]. Security: Ensuring that an update is performed
    only on the request of the authorized user is critical. Otherwise, hackers could
    take control of the device by remotely updating corrupted firmware. [20]. Energy
    Consumption: IoT devices are mostly battery-powered. When it is the case, it should
    minimize communication as wireless transmission is inherently power-hungry. However,
    a firmware update can be a large file [21]. B. Firmware Update Over the Air for
    LPWAN If the devices communicate through a LPWAN, the FUOTA process will be impacted
    accordingly, as the characteristics of such networks make the transfer of large
    file complex. The authors in [22] and [23] have surveyed existing issues and methods
    for different protocols. In LPWAN, the biggest constraint is energy consumption;
    Various strategies exist to optimize battery life and can be found in [21]. The
    second most significant issue is the data rate which can be low compared to the
    update''s size, as discussed in [24]. C. Firmware Update Over the Air for LoRaWAN
    Network This paper will focus on implementing a FUOTA process in LoRaWAN as it
    is the primary LPWAN protocol used in Agricultural applications [9]. The reason
    for this is its good technical abilities (data rate, distance, energy consumption,
    etc.) and its ability to create an ad-hoc network without relying on already existing
    network provider coverage [25] facilitating LoRaWAN deployment and usage in rural
    and remote areas. The LoRaWAN firmware update technical recommendations are described
    by the LoRa Alliance, the organism in charge of maintaining the LoRa technology,
    and can be found here [26]. The main issue with LoRaWAN FUOTA process is the size
    of the update to perform. LoRaWAN has a low data throughput and duty cycle and
    is subject to interference [29]. Therefore, sharing large data files is complex.
    To do so, three mechanisms must be applied: Multicast update (update all the device
    that needs together), clock synchronization (choose the right moment to perform
    the update), and Fragmentation (divide the update file into smaller ones). A detailed
    description of the methods applied to perform FUOTA is made by the authors in
    [27], and [28]. Regarding practical implementation, there are various attempts
    in the literature to propose a suitable solution for FUOTA in LoRaWAN. The leading
    available solution for programmers is to use The Chirp Stack LoRaWAN open source
    server [30] with the open source Embedded Device OS Mbded OS [31]. The example
    code can be found here [32]. There is also proprietary solution proposed like
    Multi-Connect Conduit [33] and Pycom [34] but only work with their specific hardware.
    On the research side, applications are relatively new and scarce: Authors in [35]
    have tried to implement FUOTA with multiple gateways, while the authors in [36]
    have looked into adaptive data rate techniques to optimize the process. Finally,
    the authors in [37] have developed a small test bench to validate the usage of
    FUOTA for LoRa in the agricultural domain, where the distance and energy factors
    have been studied to validate the practical application of FUOTA in Farms. D.
    Firmware Update for TinyML Model TinyML adaptation capabilities are a well-known
    issue as the inference model must be pre-trained before being embedded in a hardware-constrained
    IoT node [13]. To allow a device to adapt its model over time regarding the specific
    environment where it is deployed, researchers have proposed methods to allow on-device
    learning, like the author in [38] and [39]. However, we assert that TinyML model
    could still be pre-train on dedicated servers and then remotely updated on the
    device. Literature on this topic is scarce, and we found only one approach proposed
    by the author in [40] to update the model remotely through WiFi. They use a web
    platform to allow the end device to fetch the model it needs for different applications
    allowing the end device to full fill various objectives. Therefore, our approach
    to updating a TinyML model through LPWAN is novel. SECTION III. Architecture Proposal
    A. Scenario Fig. 1. Use case scenario Show All An intelligent camera sensor is
    deployed in a field to detect the number of fruits thanks to a TinyML algorithm.
    It then communicates the number of fruit detected to a cloud decision platform
    through a LoRaWAN network. A decision is then taken regarding the action to perform,
    for example, fertilizer application, irrigation, or harvest. This decision is
    then communicated to the performer, for example, the farmer. This use case scenario
    is depicted in Figure 1. When the accuracy of the inferences drops below a certain
    point, the sensor device requires an update from the server with a specific message
    sent through the LoRaWAN network. The application server must then acquire new
    picture data to retrain the TinyML Model of the device. Once done, the update
    is transmitted from the application server to the LoRaWAN server, which will deploy
    the update to the defined devices with a FUOTA process. This process is describe
    in Figure 2. Fig. 2. FUOTA with LoRaWAN network: Overall process Show All Our
    architecture is therefore made of four main components: 1) Smart Sensor It uses
    TinyML to infer the number of fruit in its sight of view. If the accuracy of its
    inferences is too low, it requests a firmware update over the air. 2) Gateway
    In charge of the communication between the LoRa device and the LoRaWAN server
    on the internet. 3) LoRaWAN Server In charge of receiving and dispatching the
    message from the device and the Application Server. Also in charge of the FUOTA
    process in LoRa. 4) Application Server In charge of the model retraining when
    enough new data are acquired. B. Environment Development The prototype is built
    with the following hardware and software parts: For the microcontroller with the
    camera sensor, performing the TinyML algorithm, and getting remotely updated,
    we use an Arduino Portenta H7 microcontroller with a Lora Vision shield. It is
    a 32-bit Microcontroller with a suitable specification to perform TinyML. We already
    proposed a prior TinyML application with this sensor [12]. The Arduino Portenta
    is running ARM Mbded Operating System [31] to perform the update when new firmware
    is received. Using the Arduino Ecosystem should help replicate our experiment
    for other researchers. To create and update the TinyML algorithm, we used Edge
    Impulse, the development platform based on tensor flow lite proposed by Google
    [41]. Finally, to communicate with LoRa, we use a Laird RG1868 gateway with the
    ChirpStack open source LoRaWAN Server that has already included tools for FUOTA
    [30]. Fig. 3. Laird RG1 running ChirpStack (left) and arduino portenta running
    MBEDOS (right) Show All C. Phases In this section, we describe the end-to-end
    phases implemented in our prototype. 1) Phase 1 - Firmware Update Request After
    the sensor deployment, the farm ecosystem around the sensor might change, making
    the accuracy of its inferences drop beyond an acceptable point (value to define
    regarding the application criticality). When the sensor notices that it has reached
    this point, it sends a special message to the server to inform of its situation
    and request a new model update. 2) Phase 2 - New Data Acquisition Once the server
    is noticed that an update is required, it should gather new data. In our scenario,
    farmers could take new pictures in the field. However, it could be interesting
    in future work to ask sensors to offload punctual pictures to increase the variety
    and quantity of data allowing the model to evolve. 3) Phase 3 - Model Re-Training
    We use Edge Impulse FOMO (Faster Objects, More Objects) algorithm to make our
    fruit detection [41]. With it, the device can count objects, find the location
    of objects in an image, and track multiple objects in real-time using up to 30x
    less processing power and memory than other similar dedicated algorithms such
    as MobileNet SSD or YOLOv5 [42]. 4) Phase 4 - FUOTA The FUOTA procedure is described
    precisely in [26]–[28]. Its architecture is shown in Figure 4. Fig. 4. LoRaWAN
    FUOTA specifications architecture Show All It is made of three components: The
    Network Server (NS) is at the core of the FUOTA process. It handles the communication
    of the unusually large update file by choosing the gateways used to broadcast
    the messages in compliance with the local regulations and limiting-self interference.
    The End Devices (ED) must implement the file distribution client (FDC) on top
    of the LoRaWAN link layer protocol stack. The FDC comprises three different protocols:
    Clock synchronization, multicast, and fragmentation. The Application Server (AS)
    handles the application encryption and decryption of the messages while also processing
    the application data mechanics. The interactions between AS and NS are specific
    to the application. The AS communicates with the NS to gather multicast settings
    to prepare the update when needed. The overall process of FUOTA is not standardized
    by the LoRa Alliance, which only provides recommendations. Here we will describe
    the process applied in the MBOS/ Chirp Stack project [32] that we implemented
    later with a TinyML update. This process can be seen in Figure 5. LoRaWAN devices
    can be of three classes: A, B, or C. A and B are the most frequent as they are
    less energy-consuming than C, but class C allows better transmission reliability.
    For more information, please refer to [43]. We take the case of a FUOTA for a
    device in Class A, meaning the device is always asleep unless it sends an uplink
    message or during a short receiving window after the uplink is sent. The FUOTA
    starts when the Application Server request the Network Server to update multiple
    devices in class A. The NS first needs to prepare every device for the multicast
    session. For that, every time one device sends an uplink, the Network server sends
    an acknowledgment and a multicast address. The same mechanism is employed to set
    up the fragmentation. Afterward, the device will send a synchronization request.
    When satisfied, the NS will request the device to go in C class at a precise hour,
    so every device to be updated goes in C class simultaneously; C class means the
    device is never asleep and constantly listening for messages. All the devices
    go in C class at the defined time and listen for the multicast transmission. The
    End device reconstructs the fragmented firmware update file thanks to various
    error correction mechanisms. Then it restarts itself, and the bootloader will
    load the new firmware image if it is correct, discarding the previous one. Finally,
    an acknowledgment of success is sent to the NS. If anything goes wrong during
    the process, the devices that are not correctly updated will be flagged for a
    new cycle of FUOTA. Fig. 5. LoRaWAN FUOTA session Show All SECTION IV. Experimentation
    A. Firmware Update Over the Air Performance Evaluation To test our prototype,
    we train a first model with a dataset of 100 pictures containing between 1 and
    5 strawberries. The accuracy of the FOMO algorithm reaches 90.2%, the RAM usage
    is 243.9 kb, and the size of the firmware is 77.5 kb, respectively 24.39% and
    3.88% of the Arduino''s hardware capabilities, leaving room for improvement. Afterward,
    we train another model with 100 different pictures for the same application. This
    time the accuracy is 89.2%, the RAM usage is 252.2 kb, and the firmware size is
    83.6 kb. Both models seem equivalent in performance when tested in real life directly
    on the microcontroller. We then implement Mbed OS 5.11.1 and flash the first TinyML
    model. Finally, we perform a FUOTA session to update the device with the other
    firmware containing the new model, as described previously and in [32]. All FUOTA
    tests have been made with only one device. The system behaves as expected and
    implements the new firmware after reboot meaning there is no particular issue
    for an update due to the nature of the TinyML compared to a classic firmware update.
    However, the duration of the update is more important with the TinyML firmware
    update (2m23s average of 10 tests) compared to the example update (32.3s average
    of 10 tests) provided in the OS. This is explained by the update size (83.6 kb
    for the tinyML firmware vs. 5.2 kb for the example update). You can find all the
    sources of our prototype with the adapted Mbed OS and further explanation on our
    GitHub [44]. B. Energy Consumption Evaluation Modeling energy consumption is a
    complex process in the IoT domain as it is highly dependent on the hardware specificities
    and various other parameters, as discussed in [21]. For our experiment, we used
    the simple energy evaluation model from the INET framework of the Omnetpp simulator
    [45] on a PC running Ubuntu 20.04 with 16GB RAM and an Intel I7 8565U. The hardware
    power consumption values for different running modes are gathered from the datasheet
    of the Arduino Portenta and are presented in table I. Table I Power consumption
    of the system To show energy consumption, we considered two scenarios. In each
    scenario, the device is in standby mode the majority of the time and only wakes
    up once a day to perform one TinyML inference and transmits a small telemetry
    message to the server. Moreover, the device wakes up once a week to be updated
    with a new firmware of 100kb size. In the first scenario, all communication are
    performed with LoRa, and in scenario 2 we use WiFi as a point of comparison. The
    simulator then evaluates the lifetime expectancy of the battery and run until
    both scenarios are out of power for a 2000 mA battery. Results are presented in
    Figure 6 and 7. It appears that using LoRa in such application could represent
    a significant energy saving compared to WiFi usage. However, improved optimization
    should be proposed in future work. Furthermore, we propose an evaluation of the
    battery lifetime for various sizes of firmware updates. Results are presented
    in Figure 8 and 9. As expected, the update''s size negatively impacts energy consumption,
    and the system runs out of battery quicker with large update files. However, the
    energy consumption is not proportional to the firmware size. Fig. 6. Evolution
    of battery level over time Show All Fig. 7. Battery lifetime of the system in
    days Show All Fig. 8. Evolution of battery level over time for various size of
    firmware Show All Fig. 9. Battery lifetime of the system in days for various size
    of firmware Show All C. Packet Delivery Ratio We use the Flora framework from
    Omnetpp [46] on the same previous hardware to characterize the packet loss ratio
    of the network regarding the number of devices being updated at the same time
    and the size of the firmware. The results are presented in Figure 10. We notice
    that the packet delivery ratio of the network decrease as the number of device
    on the network increase. This is a result of higher interference. We also emphasize
    the effect of the firmware size on the network. As it increases, the packet delivery
    ratio drops down faster as the number of nodes increases. Fig. 10. Packet delivery
    ratio per node number Show All SECTION V. Conclusion We propose in this paper
    an analysis of the FUOTA process for LoRaWAN with a specific application for TinyML
    model in an Agricultural Scenario. We then perform real-life experimentation of
    a FUOTA process to prove the feasibility of the solution while determining its
    energy efficiency through different scenarios. Despite promising results, it seems
    that remotely updating large-size firmware with LoRaWAN is costly in terms of
    energy consumption, especially if multiple devices are to be updated simultaneously,
    creating interference. However, It is our assumption that such methods could,
    if better optimized, be used to deploy Smart devices performing AI in farms. Future
    work should be oriented toward optimizing the FUOTA process for the TinyML model
    in LoRaWAN. It should also be essential to study the offload of images through
    the LoRaWAN network to collect data to facilitate the model re-training after
    its deployment in a new environment. Finally An interesting approach could be
    to use different Radio Access Technologies on the same device, such as LoRaWAN
    for standard data transmission and LTE for Firmware Update and Data offload. Authors

  description: Climatic factors affect various stages of plant growth, thereby affecting
    agricultural productivity and production stability. The growth and development
    of various tissues and organs during the complete growth period of plants are
    affected by changes in climate and environment. The genotype is the internal cause
    for the expression of the phenotype, while the environment is the external conditions
    for the appearance of various morphological characteristics. With the rapid progress
    of high-throughput plant phenotype measurement technology, combined with genomics,
    bioinformatics, and big data computing, plant phenotyping will greatly promote
    the process of functional genomics research and crop molecular breeding and efficient
    cultivation. Phenotypes can effectively track the links between genotypes, environmental
    factors, and phenotypes. Without detailed phenotype data, it is difficult to fully
    understand the complex effects of genomic and environmental factors on plant phenotypes.
    Therefore, difficulties in plant scientific research are gradually shifting from
    genetic analysis to phenotypic analysis. Plant phenotyping began at the end of
    the 20th century, and its core was to obtain high-quality, reproducible trait
    data, and then quantify the interactions of genotype and environment and their
    impact on key traits related to yield, quality, and stress resistance. As more
    and more plant and trait parameters must be measured quickly and accurately, many
    of the world's top scientific research institutions have shifted their research
    focus to solving practical problems such as experimental design, quantitative
    analysis, and interpretation of conclusions. Characterizing key traits through
    phenotypic analysis can provide big data-based decision support for breeding,
    cultivation, and agricultural practices. Plant genomes have undergone rapid development
    in recent years, but the lack of sufficient phenotypic data has limited human
    ability to parse quantitative trait genetics. This can be addressed by developing
    a plant phenotypic information collection platform and performing image analysis.
    High-throughput, automated, high resolution plant phenotypic information collection
    platforms and analytical technologies are critical to the acceleration of plant
    improvement and breeding, increasing yield, and resistance to pests and diseases.
    These systems are used to analyze genomic information and quantitatively study
    complex traits related to growth, yield, and adaptation to biotic or abiotic stress.
    It is an important pathway for integration, which can fulfill the gaps between
    genomic information and plant phenotypic plasticity. With the growth in the demands
    of scientific research and the development of imaging sensor technology, it has
    become possible to collect high-throughput, high-efficiency, high-precision, low-error,
    and low cost automatic phenotypic information. The data monitored by imaging sensors
    is objective and can monitor and analyze plants in real time. Therefore, automatic
    phenotype information collection technology has begun to be widely used in plant
    phenotype information collection platforms. With the development of modern and
    intelligent agricultural equipment, scholars hope to discover functionally diverse
    species and compare performance and plant response to the environment in a large
    number of plants. To generate a correlation between phenotypic traits, genes,
    environment, and expression, high-throughput plant phenotype information collection
    has been invented. High-throughput refers to the ability to measure more samples
    and/or more data points than manual phenotyping, not only with a high number of
    samples per unit time, but also with the synchronization and efficiency of data
    processing and parameter acquisition. The hardware platform scans the source data
    to match. High-throughput phenotyping relies on rapid transportation, automated
    sensing, data acquisition, data analysis methods and technical equipment, and
    is carried out by various sensors, such as CCD camera, near-infrared instrument,
    infrared instrument, thermal imager, spectral imager, fluorescence imager, etc.,
    to monitor indoor and field plants, so as to obtain more phenotypic parameters
    in a short time. Due to the huge potential of plant phenotype information collection
    technology in the agricultural field, scientific research institutions and enterprises
    in various countries are actively developing and constructing high-throughput
    plant phenotype information collection platforms. Phenotypic data collection and
    analysis methods are the core part of plant phenotyping research, including indoor
    and outdoor parts. Modern indoor high-throughput plant phenotype detection platforms
    generally detect plants closely related to plant genetics and variation through
    automated transmission equipment and integrated sensors (such as visible light,
    near-infrared, far-infrared, fluorescence, multispectral, laser, hyperspectral,
    etc.). The acquisition of a plant dynamic growth and developmental phenotype dataset.
    Its advantages are high resolution, high controllability and high-throughput,
    which can provide high-quality multidimensional images and experimental data for
    subsequent plant phenotyping. Whether it is aboveground or underground, indoor
    phenotype monitoring usually takes the individual plant as the unit and describes
    the population characteristics by collecting the characteristics of the individual
    plant. Depending on the image sensor accuracy, the extracted phenotypic data can
    often be accurate down to the tissue cell level. Thus, the scale division of indoor
    phenotypic traits can range from populations to histiocytes. Field-oriented plant
    phenotyping platforms provide accurate and continuous collection of single leaves
    or plant organs, single plants, small plots, and entire farms from proximal to
    long distances, mainly including vehicle-mounted, self-propelled, gantry, and
    suspension as well as several types such as drones, aerial remote sensing and
    spectral satellite imaging. The field high-throughput platform mainly includes
    two types of field machinery and UAVs equipped with multi-sensors, which can achieve
    rapid and non-destructive acquisition of plant population phenotype information
    under field conditions. The combination of agricultural machinery and equipment
    with a multi-sensor platform can effectively reduce the variation in measurement
    results but is limited by the distribution of crops and soil conditions after
    irrigation. Therefore, it is difficult to quickly realize cross-regional applications,
    the operation efficiency is low, and it cannot be used over a large range. However,
    the rapid analysis of field crop phenotype information based on an UAV-equipped
    multi-sensor platform has high technical efficiency and low cost and is suitable
    for complex farmland environments. It has a wide range of applications in the
    analysis of crop height, chlorophyll content, LAI, disease susceptibility, drought
    stress sensitivity, nitrogen content and yield, making it an important means to
    obtain crop phenotype information. Plant roots are an important part of plants
    and have very important functions such as water and nutrient absorption and transport,
    organic matter storage, plant anchoring, and interaction with soil. Since roots
    grow underground, the core of collecting root phenotypes is how to visualize roots
    growing under natural conditions. Therefore, the collection and analysis of root
    phenotypic traits has become the focus and challenge of biological and phenotypic
    research. At present, the research progress of cultivation and improvement based
    on root traits is very slow, and the screening of root traits is still a very
    time-consuming task. Researchers must continue to develop systematic and large-scale
    high-throughput root phenotyping platforms suitable for different cultivation
    goals, so as to accelerate the screening of root traits and the understanding
    of root function, and to gain an in-depth understanding of how root traits are
    related to whole plant stress resistance strategies correlate to increase crop
    productivity and ultimately successfully identify key root traits for crop improvement.
    In recent years, with the continuous development of remote sensing and related
    sensor technologies, a variety of non-destructive plant detection technologies
    have emerged, providing effective means for crop phenotype monitoring, disease
    and insect pest monitoring, and crop identification. RGB cameras are a relatively
    common sensor device in crop phenotyping technology. In the experiment, a digital
    camera with visible light imaging on a UAV can be used to improve the efficiency
    of data collection and achieve rapid acquisition of high-definition images. It
    can be used to monitor crop emergence during agricultural production, rate, flowering
    dynamics, canopy coverage, and lodging. Thermal imaging sensors use an infrared
    detector and an optical imaging lens to receive infrared radiation energy in a
    photosensitive element infrared detector. Infrared imaging technology is used
    to measure plant canopy temperature to infer plant water use efficiency and photosynthesis
    efficiency. It is also used to measure the response of crops to osmotic stress
    such as salinity or drought. It can also measure the impact of other abiotic stresses
    on organisms and detect the presence of pests in the grain. Because the crop canopy
    temperature changes with time, conventional handheld infrared temperature measurement
    equipment is limited by its low measurement efficiency, and it is difficult to
    be widely used in large-scale breeding areas. However, UAVs are equipped with
    thermal imagers for breeding areas, where canopy temperature provides a new efficient
    and reliable method. At present, thermal infrared technology is increasingly used
    in the field of precision agriculture. To ensure stable agricultural production,
    increased production and food security, optimized agricultural production structure,
    and a reduction in the use of pesticides and fertilizers, it is necessary to accurately
    monitor and warn the occurrence of diseases during agricultural production. Experts
    at home and abroad have carried out a series of thermal infrared imaging technology
    to detect crop disease research. The importance of data interpretation in phenotyping
    research cannot be overstated. With the continuous development of phenotyping
    platforms and related technologies at home and abroad, the current plant high-throughput
    phenotyping platform can obtain massive digital images, point cloud data, spectral
    imaging and thermal imaging data, and undergo geometric correction, radiometric
    correction, and data modeling. And a series of processing processes, and finally
    realize the use of remote sensing means to analyze plant phenotype information.
    High-throughput phenotyping is expected to become the latest tool for sustainable
    production under global climate change. However, at present, there are few plant
    species as the research objects of plant phenotype information, and there is a
    lack of analysis and identification of plant phenotype information in complex
    natural environments. The breadth and depth of plant phenotype analysis research
    must be continuously expanded to establish a unified plant phenotype monitoring
    system and specifications, form a network resource sharing library, and strengthen
    mutual cooperation among developers of various phenotype platforms. Using modern
    mathematical analysis methods, the rapidity and effectiveness of the algorithm
    can be achieved in image processing and recognition software design to improve
    the analysis ability of the analysis module of the plant phenotype monitoring
    system. It is necessary to use multi-domain knowledge to carry out comprehensive
    control and establish background expert decision-making support systems to automatically
    monitor and analyze target plants in real time.

    Location: Lagos, Nigeria SECTION I. Introduction The Internet of Things (IoT)
    has emerged as a megatrend for next-generation technology with far-reaching implications:
    advanced networking of end machines, devices, and services. Smart health care,
    smart cities, defense, shopping, traffic congestion, industrial control, and agriculture
    are only a few of the applications where IoT can help [1]. There have been a lot
    of research on IoT technology in the agricultural field to improve smart farming
    solutions [2]. We can gather data from sensing instruments and send it to the
    main servers thanks to efforts made on wireless sensor networks [3]. Irrigation
    is the method of providing water to land or soil artificially to improve growth
    and production of crops during periods of inadequate rainfall [4]. Creating a
    reliable means of supplying water for irrigation in regions that have little or
    no rainfall across a year is a form of precision agriculture. Therefore, it is
    necessary for a farmer to adopt an automated system to control these activities
    to ensure a seamless and unbiased supply of water [5]. Data collection and data
    availability in irrigation are two issues that commercial agricultural industries
    face. Using an intelligent, digitalized, computed, and automated [6] [7] system
    for irrigation would enhance farmers productivity. The data collected could be
    accessed from any location, and in the absence of the farmer. The work creates
    a design and constructs an automatic irrigation system that supplies water to
    crops at low moisture levels and built an information system that collects data
    automatically from the field through the use sensors. SECTION II. RELATED WORKS
    A. Automated Irrigation A model for maximizing water use in crop plantations has
    been established by [8] to automate irrigation, the system using a wireless network
    of soil moisture, temperature, and humidity sensors [9] data from the web. [10]
    developed an automated sprinkler irrigation system. An instantaneous intelligent
    sensor arrangement for determining soil temperature and moisture content, was
    developed by [11]. [12] developed an automated irrigation system to reduce manual
    irrigation stress and water consumption [13][14] for home gardens and farm fields.
    B. IoT Based Agriculture In [15], both the irrigation status and the irrigation
    controllers and actuators can be monitored off the farm, making the irrigation
    system more trustworthy. An improved auto-irrigation system was developed [16]
    using two tools: the \"WiSA\" and IrrigWeb, created for irrigation management
    in sugarcane. [17] investigated the current network technologies used in IoT-based
    agriculture such as the interconnection of the IoT agricultural systems with big
    data and cloud computing while considering security issues in using IoT. [18]
    developed an IoT monitoring system linked up to the Internet that used wireless
    sensor networks [19][20] to predicts the outbreak of plant epidemic disease using
    AI to store soil information in a database. [21] adopted a model in grape vineyards
    to detect the best time to apply control treatments for the downy mildew. [22]
    proposed a prototype for soil moisture level assessment using a wireless sensor
    network. [23] proposed the design of an autonomous system for irrigating a farm
    by the utilization of microprocessors. The system was designed to detect and recommend
    the best time for water supply to the plants. A smart irrigation system was proposed
    by [24], the system made it easy for the farmer to know and control his farm without
    being physically present, and time and energy are saved. SECTION III. SYSTEM ANALYSIS
    AND DESIGN The IoT data acquisition and irrigation system is divided into two
    parts: (i) The hardware and (ii) software parts. A. The Hardware Design The physical
    design of the system includes all of the hardware required for the system’s successful
    execution. The system’s circuit architecture, as well as how the components are
    connected to ensure the system’s operation. Fig. 1. Hardware Blck Diagram Show
    All B. The Hardware Specifications Three major sensors are used, soil moisture
    sensor, temperature sensor, and humidity sensor to interface with the Arduino
    Uno and linked to the Internet through the ESP 8266 NodeMCU device and the firebase
    server to receive the data. Table 1 is a summary of the major components of the
    IoT data acquisition and automated irrigation system. TABLE I. Hardward specification
    C. Software Design The mode of operation of the microcontroller determines the
    type of programming language to be used in the design and development of the software.
    There are many programming languages that can be implemented in the software development.
    The analysis of the software requirement determines the choice of programming
    language to be used in the design process and they include: ability to interface
    with system control unit and peripherals, ability to convert analog signal to
    machine code, ability to control the system, and ability to select preference.
    Based on the above requirement for the total software design the Assembly language
    interface with C programming is the most appropriate for this design. With the
    CodeBlocks the Arduino UNO was created. The Arduino microcontroller was programmed
    using the Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Arduino IDE is a unique
    open-source Arduino program. The micro-controller is connected to the COMPUTER
    via a Universal serial bus (USB) cable. The Arduino’s ADC monitors the analog
    input voltage changes and converts it to a binary number from 0 to 1023 bits.
    During an analog-to read, output, no, no), it returned a number in the range 0
    to 1023 and compared with the voltage used for the output. D. Circuit Design The
    circuit diagram can be generated from the hardware block diagram in Figure 1,
    as shown in Figure 2. Proteus design suite version 8.8 was used to create the
    circuit diagram and run the circuit simulation. The Proteus software application
    is an electrical/electronic design software that is used to create printed circuit
    board schematics and designs (PCB). It is employed in the production of electrical
    circuit testing. It saves time and resources that would otherwise be wasted in
    manually connecting components. The central component the Arduino Mega is connected
    to the soil moisture sensor on analogue pin ‘A2’ shown on the left side of Figure
    2. The temperature sensor was connected to digital pin 4 since it is a digital
    sensor. The relay which has 2 states (HIGH or LOW) is connected to digital pin
    11; ‘HIGH’ turns the pump ON while a ‘LOW’ turns it OFF. The input voltage Vin
    in this circuit is 12V and the Vout is 5V respectively. The water pump is represented
    by the motor symbol is connected to digital pin 7, via a relay. It is a digital
    device because it also has 2 states (HIGH or LOW). ‘HIGH’ turns the pump ON while
    a ‘LOW’ turns it OFF. The NodeMCU device is connected to digital pin 12. The Arduino
    processes the signal got from the soil moisture and temperature sensors and sends
    it to the NRF24L01 transmitter from where the data is transmitted to the cloud
    after which the receiver is to receive data from the transmitter and then the
    nodeMCU processes the data that the receiver gets to a serial monitor. The Serial
    monitor is connected to pins 0 and 1 to provide an interface for the values to
    be read during the simulation. The circuit diagram of figure 2 shows all the components
    that are to be used in the project which have been properly analyzed and calculated.
    Fig. 2. Circuit Diagram Show All E. Flow Chart Diagram Prime cloud-based platform
    an open-source program was adopted in this work. A NRF24L01 module can be used
    to send the sensing elements to a cloud service. Over the Internet, the sensor’s
    data is received and collected. Updates all logs discovered throughout the day
    and starts the app to check the user’s status. To use these capabilities, the
    user must first create a user account or a dedicated IP address, which consists
    of multiple channels that tracks the system’s various parameters. Figure 3 shows

    IoT; offloading mechanism 1 Introduction It is evident that agriculture always
    has a specialized role in the anthrophonic evolution and has been serving as an
    important economic factor for the growth of a country [1]. Around 58% of the population
    depend on agriculture as the chief source of livelihood in India. The quality
    and productivity of agricultural products have declined over these years as several
    factors have influenced the crop productivity both directly and indirectly. Some
    major factors that affect the crop production are climatic changes, global warming,
    and water scarcity [2]. The agricultural land’s productivity is affected by the
    direct and indirect changes in climate [3,4]. The crop growth has been already
    affected by the changes in climate incurred by global warming. The nutrition quality
    of soil, ground water level, sea, and ocean are affected by the modifications
    in average temperature, rainfall, and extreme weather conditions such as hail
    storms, dust storms, heatwaves, etc. due to global warming [5,6]. Degradation
    of soil is primarily created by various methods including 93.7% by water erosion,
    9.5% by wind erosion, 5.9% by salinity and alkalinity, etc. Further changes in
    climate would influence adversely the crop production [7]. Since water is an indispensable
    requirement for plants and cultivation, the high level of soil is eroded and thereby
    the fertility is also declined. Due to the ever-changing climate, water scarcity
    has become a huge problem. Drought-like conditions is already formed in several
    areas and thereby the present and conventional farming practices are not suitable.
    New and unique environment preserving techniques are the need of the hour [8].
    The conventional approaches in agriculture are enhanced by the advent of several
    advancements in technology [9]. These new improved methodologies ensure optimized
    utilization of resources, accurate forecast of water needs and environmental parameters,
    reduction of human intervention, etc. [10]. Consequently, the outcomes of crops
    in terms of yield and quality are higher with cost-effective methods. One such
    booming technology is the Internet of things (IoT) [11]. IoT is the collection
    of components embedded in the sensor for measuring and transferring data via network
    devices as sensed from pumps and tractors to weather stations. Primarily, IoT
    deals with the transmission and reception of data related to farms through devices
    using the Internet for prediction and providing decisions to the farmers. IoT-based
    methodologies has brought a changeover in agricultural patterns and farming approaches
    [12]. IoT devices can gather information about soil moisture, chemical properties,
    dam levels, livestock health, and weather details in real time. The information
    acquired from IoT devices facilitates the farmers in tracking farms periodically.
    Farmers can save time and money by responding faster to farm conditions. Cloud
    computing models integrated with on-field agricultural sensors need to be incorporated
    for tackling the issue of processing huge voluminous data. One of the major challenges
    of IoT is the processing of huge datasets in a sequential way. Some of the key
    factors that need to be focused on this process are as follows: information about
    the type and nature of data, the way of acquiring the data, etc. The preliminary
    stage comprises acquiring the data and ingesting the data to the system. Substantial
    cognizance of data are achieved as the data pass through all the gateways where
    it is cleansed and transformed before entering into the system. In the near future,
    dynamic prediction of soil moisture and precipitation techniques are to be developed
    for smart irrigation systems. Therefore, a system is developed for efficient and
    optimal utilization of fresh water in irrigation along with drip irrigation system.
    It aids in finding which one of the plants fails to get sufficient water. When
    the water supply is provided the next day, this delay should not disturb the system.
    It becomes important for the farmers to understand the optimal usage of water
    and fertilizers to bring out sustenance in the agricultural industry. Therefore,
    processing must be done for analyzing the data, so that patterns can be analyzed
    and planning can be done for the long term, accordingly. Hence, it gives a broad
    vision in deciding where the processing is to be done exactly. Therefore, it is
    obvious that not all data are crucial, and it provides a clear view of which data
    need to be stored, discarded, and retained for both long-term and short-term purposes.
    Thus, all these challenging issues require to be addressed and that is where storage
    technologies are actually highlighted. The poor quality of Internet access in
    developing nations makes the implementation quite challenging. An applicable solution
    to solve this problem is through edge computing where the essential data could
    be offloaded from the cloud over the edge of the cloud, and this is the exact
    point where the approach of smart sensing with edge computing gets in. With the
    purpose of broadening the potential of edge computing and using it in the agriculture
    domain, a novel approach using machine learning (ML) methods is proposed for analyzing
    the data acquired by the IoT devices deployed at the farm. Here, the data acquired
    from IoT components undergo preprocessing and ML models on the edge nodes to analyze
    and assess the appropriate results for providing the best instructions for controlling
    the actuators (e.g., light, pumps at different locations) in the farms. This article
    presents an automated system, as shown in Figure 1, to predict the soil moisture
    using the field information acquired from the self-designed sensor node deployed
    at the field and the forecast information of weather via Internet. A unique algorithm
    has been developed that revolves around the machine learning techniques for the
    prediction of soil moisture. Here, many algorithms with the combination of regression
    + clustering was estimated, and it is inferred that XGBoost + k-means outperforms
    other algorithmic combinations, and therefore, it is deployed for the prediction
    of soil moisture in the proposed work. The proposed algorithm makes effective
    irrigation decisions with optimized usage of water in a more accurate and reliable
    manner. The effective decision-making refers to the process of predicting the
    rainfall, thereby reducing the water usage in advance by the proposed algorithm
    in accordance with the predicted rainy days. Through this automatic decision-making,
    over watering is avoided by saving the soil. The server-side software is developed
    with node-side connectivity using the information for visualization and decision
    support features. This proposed algorithm is implemented in edge to prove the
    efficiency of the edge server handling the automated system better than the cloud
    control. The performance of the decentralized edge-based architecture has been
    evaluated for downloading the hybrid algorithm from cloud in real time execution.
    The performance can be enhanced by adopting edge computing architecture and measured
    with the help of network parameters like latency, bandwidth, and response time.
    Edge computing capacity is also estimated using the CPU processor and memory consumption
    while executing the proposed algorithm with irrigation scheduling. Figure 1 Architecture
    of the proposed system. 2 Related work In ref. [13], a smart irrigation system
    not affected by communication disconnection and delay is developed using edge
    nodes deployed at the farms. Environmental parameters have an intricate impact
    on the plant growth. It becomes necessary for evaluating multiple AI models simultaneously
    in an actual cultivation environment for comparing AI models under the same conditions.
    Due to the working of existing irrigation systems on the cloud, communication
    is instable in the concurrent evaluation of AI models. However, the instability
    does not induce an edge node in its performance. The factors such as type of plant,
    soil, climate, humidity, temperature, and soil moisture need to be considered
    for the irrigation system packed with potential smart decisions. The nature and
    type of plant, soil, and climate are queried by ontology (branch of metaphysics
    dealing with the nature of being), whereas other factors such as temperature,
    humidity, and soil moisture are sensed by the sensor network. The trained ML model
    predicts the watering decisions based on ontology and other factors as mentioned
    earlier. Smart irrigation has three modules: (i) sensor network modules that sense
    the parameters impacting the water requirement by using sensors DHT22, light sensor
    BH1750, and HL-69 hygrometer for sensing the temperature, soil moisture, light,
    and humidity in air. (ii) Edge and IoT server’s module to send and receive data
    through HTTP requests. (iii) Training module in which KNN is applied on the sample
    dataset for training and decision-making regarding the water needs. Based on the
    input values, the trained model categorizes the input into five possible classes:
    highly not needed, not needed, average, needed, and highly needed [14]. A decentralized
    smart irrigation approach is proposed for strawberry greenhouses in contrast to
    conventional cloud-based solutions for keeping the agricultural data at the edge
    of the network. A full-scale smart irrigation system in an actual strawberry greenhouse
    environment is developed after a small-scale smart irrigation networking prototype
    system and a reference architecture targeting edge data distribution for strawberry
    greenhouse applications are framed. A three-step industrial approach is formed
    for designing, implementing, and validating a solution for smart strawberry irrigation
    in greenhouses and keeping the corresponding data at the edge of the network at
    the same time: (i) A small-scale smart irrigation prototype solution with off-the-shelf
    hardware and software equipment is tested and evaluated on various types of plants
    for gaining useful insights for deployments on a large scale. (ii) A reference
    network architecture is designed for targeting smart irrigation and edge data
    distribution specifically for strawberry greenhouses. (iii) A large-scale system
    in an actual strawberry greenhouse environment is developed in Greece, incorporating
    the proposed reference architecture [15]. Edge computing is proposed for addressing
    the issues by taking advantage of computing resources in the edge of the network.
    The issues such as an edge mobile device make it easier to achieve low end-to-end
    latency, high bandwidth, and low jitter to services located on the edge network.
    An edge can enforce the privacy policies of its owner prior to the release of
    the data to the cloud through edge analytics. If a cloud service becomes unavailable
    due to network failure, cloud failure, or a denial-of-service attack, a fallback
    service on a nearby edge can temporarily mask the failure. Cloud services, partial
    analysis, and control functions are extended to the edge nodes from the cloud
    data center. Edge nodes facilitate the timely monitoring of sensors in smart farming
    by the reduced latency and enhanced data transmission. Due to these factors, edge
    computing is applied through farming [16,17]. A three-tier open-source software
    platform we proposed by authors, and the platform enhanced the precision agriculture
    by introducing edge computing and fog computing. An network functions virtualization
    (NFV)-based approach is deployed for performing the local operational decisions
    at the edge level for mitigating the influence of network failures while using
    cloud data centers [18]. For control processing in smart farming, a platform enabling
    cost-effective sensor/actuator network based on IoT, utilizes edge computing [19,20].
    The authors in ref. [21] predicted the soil moisture using a mathematical model
    that measures the values given by a sensor matrix on the ground. Due to the huge
    interval in measurements (10 minutes), the model presented estimated error by
    more than 10%. This methodology has incorporated the online approach by making
    the sensors to send data every minute to edge devices without time-based interruption.
    The authors of ref. [22] applied a combinative approach of using field sensor
    network’s data along with weather forecast station’s data for the management of
    optimality in water conditions for the enhanced growth of grapes. The generated
    data are forwarded to a web server, which displays graphics without statistical
    analysis of such data. The analysis must be performed a posteriori by the user.
    The watering mechanism for a plant via IoT methodology is devised by the proposed
    smart irrigation model without acquiring any pre-processed data. A prototype application
    is developed, which gets adapted to the parameters needed in irrigation after
    a couple of human-made irrigations. With the usage of various ML algorithms, several
    tests are devised for manual and automated irrigations for the performance evaluation.
    After the evaluation using four different ML algorithms such as logistic regression
    (LR), K-nearest neighbors (KNN), Gaussian naive Bayes (GNB), and gradient boosting
    regression trees (GBRT), it is found that GBRT outperforms other algorithms. To
    analyze the overall performance, a test bed for the sensor edge, mobile client,
    and the decision service on the cloud is established. Two different indoor species
    are selected as test items for the prototype, namely, Peace lily and Sardinia.
    The outcomes were quite good, and it is inferred that the prototype has learned
    the patterns of irrigation and making decisions automatically with a high rate
    of accuracy [23]. The authors from ref. [24] adopted the deep learning methodology
    for detecting the type and the category of the plant using an automated plant
    irrigation system. The water necessity of the plant is determined using the recognition
    of predefined set of plant images and data set acquired from farm. It utilizes
    the database for fetching the irrigation information after the recognition process
    is completed. Modeling the training processes are time consuming as voluminous
    set of images needs to be stored. The authors in refs [25,26] incorporated ML
    methods in the irrigation decision support model using a pre-processed irrigation
    data set. A model is developed for learning the irrigation needs of any plants
    progressively rather than using a readily available dataset. Several ML algorithms
    are evaluated with their precision for concluding the irrigation decisions. Manual
    irrigations are performed two times before making precise decisions. Due to the
    dynamicity in model, data processing is done progressively, and it can be applied
    to several plants having varying irrigation conditions. There is a need for the
    learning model that can be trained by itself using a comparatively lighter learning
    process using environmental parameters that do not need larger storage in the
    system but need higher computation. From the aforementioned survey for making
    a precise decision with instant computation locally, edge computing needs to be
    integrated into the irrigation system. This article is directed towards presenting
    a platform that implies IoTs and edge computing in monitoring soil moisture via
    sensors, data communication between sensors and edge devices, and an Analytics-as-a-Service
    cloud. It analyzes the collected data in the form of a density map of soil moisture
    for denoting the areas in need of greater or lesser frequency of irrigation. Here,
    density map does not refer to the geographical point data by satellite mapping,
    and it actually denotes the point of dry area and watery area through soil moisture
    detection point. This point is averaged among areas of irrigation to be done and
    the irrigation process is controlled with prediction of rainfall using the proposed
    system. 3 The proposed system The proposed learning model for irrigation is implemented
    in a prototype IoT system that has four components: (i) Edge node layer – This
    layer consists of sensors, actuator, and two microcontrollers. In this layer,
    edge node acquires the sensor data from the surroundings and controls the actuator
    for actuating water pumps to start irrigation. (ii) Edge server layer – This layer
    consists of Raspberry Pi that act as edge server and capable of multitask processing.
    Here, edge server controls the edge nodes for sending signal and receiving data
    at regular interval of time. It is also connected to the cloud server for receiving
    developed and trained machine learning model to be deployed and make irrigation
    decision for controlling edge nodes. (iii) Edge service layer – This layer is
    deployed in the edge server and it is responsible for controlling the whole system
    through a developed web dashboard. The dashboard has live feed data, control of
    edge nodes, and cloud services access. This service layer also has the control
    access of the proposed machine learning model. (iv) Cloud server layer – This
    layer composed of cloud services and cloud storage where its role is to train
    the machine learning model and store the data in database. It sends the trained
    proposed model to the edge server for decision-making regarding irrigation scheduling.
    The comprehensive interconnections in the system are shown in Figure 2. The proposed
    IoT-based smart irrigation system includes five major components: field deployed
    module, Web-based interface, Web API weather input, soil moisture prediction mechanism,
    and edge communication model. Figure 2 Components of the proposed system. 3.1
    Field deployed module In the field requirements, a wireless sensor network of
    the sensor nodes needs to be deployed as shown in Figure 3. Here, field data collection
    device accommodates four different sensors: Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor V2.0,
    DS18B20 Water Proof Temperature Sensor Probe for soil temperature, ultraviolet
    (UV) Light Radiation, DHT11 – Temperature and Humidity Sensor Module, and GYML8511
    Analog Output Ultra-Violet Light Sensor Module. An Arduino Mega connected to Raspberry
    Pi 4 Model-B read, the output of these sensors where the program is developed
    in Python for the Pi model to fetch the hourly data from sensors and store the
    data in MongoDB [27] database. It is then synchronized with the server database
    using the developed web service. A Wi-Fi-enabled Arduino controls the water pump
    connected to a relay switch. Figure 3 Real-time prototype of the proposed edge
    model. For the real time monitoring, a trigger is made for controlling the web
    service from the responsive web-based interface. The irrigation decisions are
    checked periodically by the proposed model performed in the server. The water
    pump is actuated, and irrigation process is started only if the server makes any
    irrigation decision. A wireless sensor network (WSN) [28] scenario with ZigBee
    [29] technology can be implemented for a large farming area in which several sensor
    nodes can be affixed in the specified area and every sensor node possesses sensors
    similar to a standalone device. Then, the Arduino Mega reads the sensor output
    connected to ZigBee for transferring data to Gateway Node for aggregating the
    received data and storing it in MongoDB locally and also for transferring the
    data via web service to the edge server. 3.2 Web-based interface The proposed
    framework consists of a web-based application to allow farmers visualize the growing
    data and interacting with the garden in real time. In addition, users can also
    be able to examine and analyze the historical growing data, if needed, through
    functionalities such as irrigation control, motor control prediction model deployment,
    and manual data entry implemented in this web application. Here, Node.js was chosen
    for developing the web application [30,31], while MongoDB [27] was utilized as
    the database system. Data stored in the database, which is deployed in the cloud,
    will be used for further data analysis in the future. The web application’s functions
    are designed following a software design pattern called model-view-controller
    (MVC) as shown in Figure 4. In the frontend, ChartJS is used to represent data
    through dynamic charts. The web application is also used as an interface to manage
    all the physical devices/actuators in the garden. To deploy the web-server to
    the cloud, a cloud platform as a service (PaaS), namely, Heroku, had been utilized.
    Heroku is a cloud platform that provides platform as a service (PaaS), facilitates
    the creation of applications and deploying these online rapidly [32,33]. It also
    enhances scalability and functionality by integrating several add-on services.
    The field data are sent to the server by Raspberry Pi using this web service.
    This web service manages the network outage/fluctuation during data synchronization
    from the field device to the server by taking the help of flag settings at the
    database level. The interface facilitates the scheduling of irrigation along with
    visualizing real time sensors and predicted soil moisture for upcoming days and
    precipitation information. By using the denoted threshold value of soil moisture
    suggested by agronomists, the irrigation can be scheduled by the user. The system
    maintains the threshold value depending on the predicted pattern of soil moisture
    and precipitation information. The process of irrigation is initiated automatically
    and stopped after the specified threshold value generated from the proposed algorithm
    of soil moisture when it is reached. Figure 4 Web interface for the irrigation
    system. 3.3 Web API weather input The weather prediction data are collected by
    a web service developed in Python. The forecast data such as humidity, temperature,
    ultra violet index, precipitation, and cloudiness of web forecasting portals like
    Open Weather API are aggregated by the developed web service [34]. These portals
    provide the forecasted information in HTML, XML, or JSON format. The predicted
    data with JSON format are read by the developed web and stored in database at
    the edge server, which is concerned in the prediction algorithm. Also, these data
    are utilized as testing dataset in the ML model for predicting the soil moisture.
    3.4 Soil moisture prediction mechanism An algorithm for predicting the soil moisture
    based on data derived from field sensors and weather forecasting using the combination
    of supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques has been developed
    underpinned by regression algorithms and k-means clustering for estimating the
    difference/change in soil moisture owing to weather conditions. Many regression
    algorithms are compared against each other and infusing each of them with k-means
    to check the preciseness in mean square error (MSE), R2, accuracy and mean absolute
    percentage error (MAPE) for prediction of soil moisture of upcoming days with
    the help of sensor data and weather forecasting days. The information about soil
    moisture for the upcoming days and suggestions for irrigation in accordance with
    the prescribed levels of soil moisture and predicted precipitation values, thereby
    saving energy and water, is presented by the algorithm. The information generated
    from the device and the predicted values from the algorithm soil moisture prediction
    hybrid algorithm (SMPHA) are stored in the server. 3.5 Edge communication model
    The communication protocols in the proposed framework are flexible and transparent
    in nature for accepting both wired and wireless methodologies. For the maximum
    utilization of potentiality in edge computing components, the communication among
    various components in the edge-IoT system requires intense probing by using the
    versatility among the devices in network edges. For transferring the data gathered
    from pivot sensors, a communication technology such as Zigbee [35] is needed for
    the irrigation systems. Therefore, the communication component in the proposed
    work is classified into three main areas as shown in Figure 5. The Message Query
    Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol is used for the communication in the proposed
    system. The analysis in ref. [36] presented seven IoT messaging protocols (MQTT,
    CoAP, XMPP, AMQP, DDS, REST-HTTP, and WebSocket) as communication protocols that
    play a major role in smart farming. The authors have concluded that MQTT proved
    to be the most secure protocol after probing all the protocols with respect to
    latency, energy and bandwidth requirements, throughput, reliability, and security.
    Moreover, MQTT is secure in both end-to-end architecture and gateway server architecture.
    In an MQTT setup, a MQTT server termed as MQTT broker executes on the IoT solution
    [37]. Under a common identifier, a “publisher” and a “subscriber” link among themselves
    to this broker. In the IoT solution, publishers and subscribers are the IoT devices
    and IoT hubs or control devices, respectively. When the publishers have new data
    for recording, the data are published to the broker. The broker then flags that
    it has new publisher data, and the corresponding data are read by the subscriber.
    Then, the subscriber analyzes the data and reacts accordingly. Figure 5 Proposed
    edge communication model. The first level accomplishes with connecting the end
    users to system with the help of mobile or web-based applications through the
    Internet. The next level (cloud computing server) deals with the connection of
    web server and MQTT broker for directing the user requests and other components
    at the edge landscape or from the farms to the right cloud-based services like
    displaying the real time status of the farm for the users, triggering a new deployment
    of the updated ML model to the corresponding edge node. The third level (farming
    area) is directed toward the deployment of sensors and IoT devices (actuators)
    for communicating with other components in the entire system. 4 Deployment of
    soil moisture prediction hybrid algorithm The watering mechanism of the plant
    has different approaches in the proposed model. Primarily, the system is trained
    with manual irrigations datasets during the process of learning with respect to
    suggestions defined by agronomists. The model is trained to learn the needs of
    irrigation in the first level of deployment in cloud without the inclusion of
    pre-processed data. After acquiring the required data and training, the proposed
    system is initiated to grasp the plant’s watering needs by undergoing plenty of
    manual irrigations. Thereafter, manual irrigation is not required and the system
    makes automated decisions in watering using the gathered data and the application
    of ML methods. The proposed model then decides the irrigation strategies automatically
    using ML methods without the need including collected datasets in the automatic
    irrigation process. The proposed model can be improved through the learning process
    when the number of precise irrigation inputs is provided to the model at each
    stage of training. The decision-making procedure is developed with two modules
    for irrigation strategies according to the soil moisture prediction for upcoming
    days. The first module deals with training the model in cloud with manual irrigation
    datasets through steps such as data collection, data preprocessing, training,
    and model development. The system acquires values of air temperature (TH), soil
    temperature (SMT), soil moisture (SM), humidity (HU), and ultraviolet rays (UV)
    periodically from the physical environment in the data collection stage, which
    is essentially required for arriving at the watering decisions. Also, the time
    of performing the manual irrigation is recorded in the database. These data are
    timestamped and stored in as datasets to aid in making decisions for knowing the
    time of irrigation. In the next step of pre-processing, inconsistencies are eliminated
    and outliers caused by sensor errors are detected from the irrigation dataset,
    thereby helping in the removal of broken data. The training stage involves the
    application of supervised machine learning (ML) algorithms. Here the regression
    algorithms such as support vector regression (SVR), multiple linear regression
    (MLR), lasso regression (LR), decision tree regressor (DTR), random forest regressor
    (RF), and XG-boost regressor (XB) techniques are used for the deployment. The
    regression algorithms are trained using the collected datasets. Finally, through
    training, regression models are created, namely, SVR model, MLR model, LR model,
    DTR model, RF model, and XB model that are been combined with the second module
    for decision-making. The second module caters to the prediction of irrigation
    for upcoming days by infusing the weather data as an input to the regression trained
    models. The live datasets from the weather API for future prediction of soil moisture
    variable are used. The dependent variables from weather forecast data like temperature
    (TH), humidity (HU), ultraviolet (UV), and precipitation (PC) are tested in the
    aforementioned model for soil moisture prediction. Then, the regression trained
    model is evaluated and deployed using the weather testing data for the prediction
    of soil moisture in accordance with the precipitation. After the prediction of
    data for the upcoming days, these developed regression models are combined with
    unsupervised ML algorithm named k-means clustering for estimating the changes
    incurred in soil moisture prediction due to the impact of weather conditions.
    Further, each regression models with k-means algorithm are evaluated for performances
    in terms of irrigation decision-making process as shown in Table 1. The combined
    algorithms are estimated through MAPE, MSE, R2, execution speed, power consumption,
    and accuracy. The estimation and computation of these parameters are detailed
    by the authors in ref. [38]. Table 1 Comparison of performance metrices obtained
    from various ML algorithms Algorithms used Accuracy R 2 MSE MAPE (%) Execution
    time Power (J) SVR + k-means 0.96 0.96 0.25 1.98 0.06078 1164.85 MLR + k-means

    (XB+k-means) approach provides more accuracy with less MSE comparatively and also
    the R2 with 98% in soil moisture prediction using combined approach is given in
    Table 1. It is evident that the proposed combination performs better when compared
    to other regression + k-means-based approaches. XB + k-means-based hybrid machine
    learning algorithm is applied in irrigation planning module on account of aforementioned
    performance metrices of ML. Although it performs moderately in terms of execution
    time and power usage, it is selected for the deployment in edge computing as it
    has better performed in terms of accuracy, R2, MSE, and MAPE metrices. It is observed
    that the prediction of soil moisture for the upcoming days from the proposed algorithm
    (XB+k-means) is nearer to the actual value as shown in Table 2, and hence, XB+k-means
    is selected for the implementation of SMPHA in edge-based irrigation scheduling.

    36.73 37.12 03-10-2021 32.88 33.01 4.1 Hardware setup IoT system is crucial to
    handle, collect, and transfer the data to the computing nodes at the edge or in
    the cloud. These devices are connected to the edge nodes through wireless communication
    protocols like ZigBee. It is used in reducing the latency and loss of data. An
    Arduino micro-control unit controls the combined IoT sensors and actuators at
    the same part of a field into a cluster, each connected to a Raspberry Pi that
    acts as an edge node in processing the gathered data and controlling the actuators.
    For example, Figure 2 shows an edge architecture with a Raspberry Pi connected
    to two components: Arduino Uno and Arduino Mega units via ZigBee connection. The
    first Arduino Mega node is responsible for collecting data from sensors and the
    second one is for controlling the actuators in the field. Depending on the sensor
    type with collecting Arduino unit, the sensors are connected via analog or digital
    PWM pins while controlling Arduino uno joins with actuators in the field and controls
    (turn on/off) them in accordance with upper layers (from the edge web server).
    The trained (cloud) and deployed ML model in edge nodes provides the necessary
    instructions to the edge nodes. 4.2 Web layer setup The deployment of web server
    assists the user in planning and managing the irrigation system. It visualizes
    the crucial information of factors like temperature of air and soil, UV, humidity,
    and soil moisture in live irrigation with real time updates in the form of various
    charts. In accordance with the selected field, the web application redirects the
    user to the field’s dashboard as shown in Figure 4. The dashboard consists of
    field parameters as well as control signals for activating all the physical devices/actuators
    at the garden layer. These signals are denoted as switch buttons, and each switch
    controls (turn on/off) a particular kind of actuator (for instance, water pump
    to start and stop the irrigation). The user interface facilitates remote controlling
    of the field by just clicking on the buttons as shown in Figure 4. 4.3 Edge layer
    setup The edge node acts as a computing center where incoming data are analyzed
    and fed as the input vector to the ML model for processing and to return the control
    signals for activating or deactivating the actuators placed at the farm. Edge
    node processes the physical data (real time) at every end device such as the collected
    and processed data via the Raspberry Pi nodes presented in the proposed scheme.
    The prediction model is designed using TensorFlow API and trained, tested on Google
    Colab in this work. Amazon Web Service (AWS) offers a library named Boto3 having
    many APIs to upload and download objects. After the development of model, it is
    transferred to Amazon S3, a service provided by AWS. The edge node utilizes the
    trained model from S3 for analyzing the sensed data acquired from garden’s sensors.
    The decision is delivered based on real time data analysis at the edge node and
    transmitted to Arduino nodes in the fields landscape immediately for controlling
    the actuators. In another flow, the data collected from sensors are filtered so
    as to keep only the modified data at the edge node before being sent back for
    mitigating the communication cost to the database in the cloud. These data are
    used in the updation of the ML model to enhance its efficiency. 4.4 Analytics
    setup The main goal of this experiment lies in gathering the various physical
    parameters of a farming land via sensors and utilizing the fetched data along
    with weather forecast information for developing an algorithm using hybrid machine
    learning approach to infuse higher accuracy in predicting the soil moisture for
    the upcoming days. As discussed in Section 4, for the proper planning and provisioning
    of optimal irrigation, the algorithm provides a predictable estimate of soil moisture
    with the assistance of various statistical measures as shown in Table 1. The measures
    are adopted for estimating the appropriateness and error rate of the proposed
    algorithm. It is inferred from the experiment that, optimal irrigation is feasible
    using a good estimation (close to the actual value) of the soil moisture (Table
    2), with the support of field data and forecast information, thereby utilizing
    the natural rain efficiently. The SMPHA ML model is interdependent on dynamic
    changes in weather environment where the models deployed on edge nodes need to
    change the controls accordingly after model gets trained continuously. For the
    process of retraining, the trained model needs to be updated. The parameters such
    as TM, HU, ST, UV, SM about grown plants are logged for the training purpose,
    and these generated datasets are recorded from the already developed manual mode
    system [39]. The growth of the Indian Mundu Chilli [40] is taken for the observation
    from the first stage to the last grown stage for 95 days. While retraining the
    model, the training is carried in cloud without causing effect to the functionalities
    at edge nodes. A signal is transferred to the corresponding edge server for triggering
    the task of updating the SMPHA model from the web server. At that time, the newly
    trained model is downloaded to replace the existing one at the considering edge
    server. From then, the ML model at the edge server is called to be updated with
    the real-world knowledge and is ready for its garden controlling tasks (to apply
    in the next farming season). 4.5 Work flow The flowchart in Figure 6 depicts the
    working of the proposed system based on the decision support system that is beneficial
    for irrigation needed for the growth of vegetables. The chilli plant is grown
    in a growbag attached with sensors and Pi as shown in Figure 3 and monitored for
    95 days of data collection. To bring out optimality in the irrigation system,
    features relating to climate, soil, crop, and field infrastructure are to be considered.
    To provide several recommendations in the production of vegetables, decision support
    systems (DSSs) are designed, which process voluminous information [39]. This proposed
    work is the extension of soil moisture differences (SMD) model [41] developed
    for soil moisture prediction. The threshold values of soil moisture are used in
    the SMD model where the system schedules the irrigation date based on the predicted
    soil moisture and weather forecast (precipitation) information automatically using
    SVR+ k-means modeling. Therefore, in the extension of the aforementioned work,
    further more number of sensors are used to log soil moisture value, which is averaged
    in the proposed model. This model is developed in two divisions of flowchart as
    shown in Figure 7, where both are interconnected. It is observed that the prediction
    of XB + k-mean approach provides better results as presented in Table 2. Figure
    6 Flow chart of the proposed edge model. Figure 7 Average response time with 10
    test scenarios. The first phase of the flowchart describes the hybrid algorithm
    for the soil moisture prediction (SMPHA) using the combination of XB + k-means
    algorithm. During the data collection step, the sensor data for the parameters,
    namely, TM, HU, ST, UV, and SM, are collected. During preprocessing, null values
    and outliers are removed and the preprocessed data are used to train the XG-Boost
    model. The developed model is then trained with variables of live weather features
    (TM, HU, UV, PC) obtained from Weather API for the prediction of SM data. These
    data are given as input to k-means clustering algorithm to predict the soil moisture,
    which is defined as SMPHA value to be infused in the next phase of the flowchart.
    The second phase of the flowchart defines the automatic irrigation planning setup.
    The setup starts obtaining the soil moisture maximum (SMMax) and soil moisture
    minimum (SMMin) values in the dashboard for setting the maximum and minimum level
    of soil moisture. Then, the current soil moisture (CuSM) is sensed and compared
    against the threshold SMMin. If the resulting value is less than SMMin, the process
    proceeds with SMPHA. On the contrary, it stops the irrigation process by sending
    0 to the relay. In SMPHA, the nearest precipitation date is selected and it is
    assigned to the predicted soil moisture (PSM). The SMMax is decided by finding
    the minimum of (PSM + SMMin, SMMax), and the predicted SMMax is further checked
    against CuSM with a condition if SMMax is greater the CuSM then it sends 1 to
    the relay as a signal to start irrigation. If the condition fails, then it sends
    0 to stop irrigation. The process of automatic irrigation ends by forecasting
    the irrigation schedule in accordance with the live weather parameters. 5 Experimental
    setup and evaluation The test bed is developed and deployed, and the data are
    collected for the analysis in irrigation management. Here, Heroku cloud platform
    is used to deploy the cloud web server. The same cloud is also installed at a
    local edge that is at two Raspberry Pi units equipped with Wi-Fi 802.11n connections
    to denote the edge nodes. JMeter application is used to get sequential accesses
    to the web page from various users for evaluating the network parameters. The
    specification of these servers is given in Tables 3 and 4. Table 3 Configuration

    of the proposed IoT-based smart farm on two different platforms, namely, in the
    cloud and on the local computer to show the feasibility and the benefit of the
    edge computing scheme. Further many parameters are considered for evaluation and
    discussed in the next section to show that edge deployment is better than cloud.
    5.1 Evaluation A hybrid machine learning methodology is used in evaluating the
    first stage of the proposed model. The predicted value of the soil moisture is
    better in terms of their accuracy and error rate. From the comparison of the other
    ML algorithms as shown in Table 2, XB + k-means performs better and taken further
    to be deployed in edge and cloud to check its efficiency with each other. Therefore,
    for analyzing the efficiency of the edge server in accordance with the proposed
    hybrid algorithm SMPHA is evaluated in terms of the time taken to train the ML
    model in edge and cloud. In this experiment Raspberry Pi is used to train the
    SMPHA model with 196,400 rows, that is, input data sample size and takes around
    1,710,000 ms (approximately 28.5 min). The same model when it is trained in Google
    Colab cloud environment, it takes 204,000 ms (approximately 3.4 min) as depicted
    in Table 5. The main purpose is to run the trained model on edge not to train
    the model at edge. So due to the lack of computing capability at the edge, it
    takes more time to train the model, but it can be ignored as it does not affect
    the purpose of the proposed model. Here, edge is introduced to obtain the task
    of computing from the cloud (i.e., offloading the task) by making the system more
    edge-oriented deployment. It can be accomplished rapidly as it requires only 14
    s to download a trained SMPHA model from the cloud to the edge node with a size
    of 3,101 kb as given in Table 5. The time to download varies according to the
    size of the trained model. So, from this process it can be inferred that downloading
    the trained model saves time when compared to training the model at the edge.
    Through this in real time, deployment of the trained SMPHA model in edge is better
    compared to deployment in cloud services. Furthermore, network parameters like
    latency, throughput, bandwidth, and response time are adopted to measure the performance
    improvements in edge computing. Table 5 Comparison of model training time Edge
    Cloud Model training time 28.4 min 3.4 min Downloading time Not applicable 14
    s The performance metrices taken into account are latency, bandwidth, and response
    time [42]. The latency of an application is the product of two factors: computing
    latency and transmission latency. The time spent on data processing and transmission
    between end devices to cloud servers is termed as computing latency and transmission
    latency, respectively. The computational capacity of the system decides the computing
    latency as the network servers possess a considerable amount of capacity to make
    the data processing faster, whereas the sensors come with limited computing capacity.
    The latency in transmission is increased by the end devices and cloud servers.
    Bandwidth: As large number of sensors are deployed in IoT, data generated would
    be huge that consumes an intense range of bandwidth and leads to several problems
    such as delay in transmission and loss of packets. It becomes unacceptable for
    the data to be transferred directly to cloud servers without applying compression.
    Therefore, data preprocessing and aggregation are needed for IoT gateways before
    redirecting them to remote cloud servers. Then, the issue to be confronted is
    to control the traffic flow by migrating data processing and aggregation tasks
    optimally to decrease the bandwidth needs of the end users while maintaining the
    data quality. Response time: The total response time is calculated by adding up
    transmission and processing time. The local deployment of the proposed model for
    controlling IoT-based irrigation are deployed on two modes: (i) Cloud mode: The
    developed SMPHA model is implemented in the cloud communicating with IoT sensors
    nodes directly to manage the irrigation process. The data are stored and processed
    at the cloud server itself where it uses Heroku platform. (ii) Edge mode – Raspberry
    Pi is deployed as an edge server that involves in processing of the SMPHA model
    controlling the IoT sensor nodes. Here, the data are stored and processed locally
    within the edge servers. This SMPHA model from both the edge and cloud does the
    job of controlling the actuators to initiate and quit the working of water flow
    motors. Through this deployment in both the environments, performance of edge
    server and cloud server can be checked in terms of latency, throughput, bandwidth,
    and response time is shown in aforementioned graphs in Figures 6, 8, and 9. This
    performance metrices is not feasible to calculate while deploying in real time,
    so the aforementioned scenarios of two modes are virtually created by generating
    many request and response threads between the servers. This sampling, load test,
    and distributed testing are conducted through JMeter application [43] and also
    verified with Wireshark [44] in cloud servers. The test scenario is created here
    by data of sending and receiving sampling data between cloud to IoT sensors and
    between Edge to IoT sensors. The sampling data considered in this work refer to
    the approximate number of requests generated by Arduino to cloud and Arduino to
    Raspberry Pi that are calculated in real time. The test scenario is divided into
    10 days of sampling data collected for each day. The evaluation results are depicted
    for latency and response times in 10 days perspective. In latency parameter, edge
    service has decreased by an average of 77.85% time compared to the with cloud.
    In the same manner, the response time of edge service is also decreased by 74.09%
    time compared to cloud service. In throughput calculation, sampling data are calculated
    for an hourly basis for the 10 hours data in a day. From the hourly comparisons
    of throughput value, edge outperforms with 67.17% high Mbps usage. Through this
    analysis as shown in Table 6, it is evident that the proposed edge computing methodology
    deployed in Raspberry Pi or in local computers outperforms the cloud-oriented
    approach. Figure 8 Average latency with 10 test scenarios. Figure 9 Average throughput
    value with 10 h test scenarios. Table 6 Performance metrices for cloud and edge
    services Performance metrices Cloud service Edge service Throughput (Mbps) 0.04944
    0.08265 Latency (ms) 1415.8 313.6 Response time (ms) 1519.6 393.8 Bandwidth (bps)
    86 1,365 Finally, to illustrate the efficiency of resource management in edge
    computing, CPU and memory utilization are considered for the analysis as both
    factors rely on the service execution model and the computational needs of the
    services being fired from off-loaders. Figure 10 depicts the utilization of CPU
    and RAM on the Raspberry Pi acting as an edge node in two cases: with and without
    the deployment of SMPHA model on it. As shown in Figure 10, the SMPHA model affects
    the CPU of the Raspberry Pi node significantly as it consumed around 41.2% of
    the CPU compared to only 3.5% when it does not host the SMPHA model. However,
    the memory (RAM) utilization in both the cases (with and without deployment of
    an SMPHA model) is nearly the same which is around 31%. Comparatively RAM utilization
    does not have much difference in with and without SMPHA. It is worthwhile to note
    that, the CPU utilization is still much lower than the 50% of total CPU capacity
    in Raspberry Pi. Therefore, it becomes feasible for adopting edge server implementation
    in the proposed irrigation system. Figure 10 CPU and memory utilization with and
    without SMPHA. 6 Conclusion This article proposed a novel approach to edge-based
    irrigation system to facilitate decision-making on watering the plants on scheduled
    time. The proposed approach applying IoT with an edge computing framework enables
    the farming system to adapt to the changes in environmental conditions automatically
    and efficiently. The process of automatic irrigation regulates irrigation according
    to the live weather parameters for forecasting the irrigation process. Soil moisture
    prediction was performed using major regression algorithms that are again combined
    with k-means clustering for estimating the changes incurred in soil moisture prediction.
    These techniques were compared through metrics such as MAPE, MSE, speed, and power
    consumption from which XB + k-means was found to perform better. The XB + k-means
    algorithm was further used for the implementation of decision mechanism on the
    developed edge computing model. The proposed edge model saves the data communication
    cost and reduces the response time of IoT services. It can be deployed on existing
    devices on the network edges serving as edge nodes, thereby reducing the overall
    implementation cost of a large-scale IoT system. The edge-based approach was found
    to perform better than the cloud-based approach in terms of response time, latency,
    throughput, and bandwidth usage. Finally, the edge model was analyzed through
    CPU and memory usage while running with and without the algorithm. In both cases,
    the memory utilization is almost lower to total available resource of the edge
    device. From this, edge device can allocate its remaining resource for other computing
    services, which increases the efficiency of edge computing device. The number
    of end edge nodes can be increased according to the field area and then to check
    the potency of the system. Conflict of interest: The authors declare no conflict
    of interest. Data availability statement: All data that support the findings of

    conference paper PDF 1 Introduction The main factor for the agriculture is to
    predict the weather, climatic changes and also mainly to predict that when the
    atmosphere conditions are going to change. Here, both the automated irrigation
    system and the IoT is employed for the irrigation monitoring. It will be helpful
    for us when to irrigate the crop or field at what conditions will the crop be
    able to sustain and also the other environment and also the other changes. To
    monitor the weather and climatic conditions which are varying with the time and
    space, so the use of these electrical devices in the agriculture has been increasing
    rapidly. So the use of these WSN technology is applied to the irrigation systems,
    and it automatically removes high risk to the cable line due to the automatic
    operations of the machines [1]. Due to the high cost of the WSN system modules,
    we are not using these type of technology and also it requires high energy for
    the data transmission between the client and server. So we will use the IoT and
    with the help of the IoT we are employing the several systems in the different
    crop fields by naming it as the clients and this clients, which is getting reported
    every time to the server about the status of the crop, climatic changes of the
    temperature, humidity, and also the moisture of the certain place. So that the
    watering and also the when the pesticides can be served based on the conditions
    on the field. The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the literature
    survey. Section 3 explains the proposed system in which the environmental changes
    are controlled using IoT through simple message transfer protocol (SMTP) and message
    queue telemetry transport protocol (MQTT). Section 4 mentions about the hardware
    description. In Sect. 5, results are discussed. Finally, conclusion in Sect. 6.
    2 Literature Survey Wireless sensor network and GPRS module are used in automatic
    irrigation system as shown in Fig. 1. A wireless sensor network in which the required
    parameter sensors are placed in the root zone of the crops. To transmit the information
    received through sensors, it has gate way unit and trigger acculators [2]. To
    know the required amount of water starting values of soil moisture and temperature
    are taken into consideration and algorithm is developed. It uses photovoltaic
    panel and cellular internet communication link for data transference and irrigation
    check. First and foremost, it uses expensive and complex algorithms to get the
    required information. Secondly, it doesn’t help to control the environmental changes
    and low-communication speed. Fig. 1 GPRS module in automated irrigation system
    Full size image 2.1 Smart Phone Irrigation Taking agricultural crops into consideration,
    irrigation sensor was designed. The camera captures the images of the soil and
    roots of the crop to estimate the requirement of water. To estimate the wet and
    dry area of the crop using antireflective glass window an android app was developed
    so that this app activates the device to capture the images. A Wi-Fi connection
    is also needed to control the irrigation as in Fig. 2. This model addresses a
    lot of issues like having a smart phone with a Wi-Fi connection resulting in battery
    issues of phone, poor signal and time consuming. Fig. 2 Smart phone irrigation
    Full size image 2.2 Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) To get the best crop conduction,
    increase the productivity WSN is used as in Fig. 3. Many environmental parameters
    are sensed using sensors which continuously sends the data about water shortage.
    The soil conditions, need of water and climatic changes are known by using a Bluetooth
    device [3, 4]. This Bluetooth is used to transfer the information from sender
    to the receiver. Though this model is of low cost and gives the output results,
    it cannot recollect the old data, and it is less secure weather forecasting cloud
    technologies are not used. Fig. 3 Wireless sensor network Full size image 2.3
    IoT in Agriculture IoT has the ability to rule the world in many industries, smart
    cities and especially when it comes to agricultural sector it has a great wallop.
    The conventional based farming approach is too difficult when compared to smart
    farming based IoT [5, 6]. It has great advantages like less water usage, control
    over environment and updated input treatments. It makes stock man and farmers
    to get the useful data, making the farmers understand the process by installing
    the necessary smart ways to increase the productivity as in Fig. 4. Fig. 4 IoT
    in agriculture Full size image 2.4 Drone Applications of IoT in Agriculture It
    is one if the best application of today’s growing technology. It handles crop
    health, irrigation, crop records, crop spraying and soil field analysis. Drones
    get the data by insight monitoring and observations [7]. To select a ground resolution
    farmer, enter the data so that plant height measurement, yield prediction and
    so on can be identified. It is used by many organizations and one of the most
    recognized application of IoT agricultural division. It utilizes various sensors,
    control systems, robotics, automated hardware, free vehicles [8]. It adopts high-speed
    internet, mobile devices and low-cost satellites are few technological trends.
    The chance of crops being damaged will be reduced if accuracy of weather is high.
    It is used for food production and safety. Agriculture IoT not only concentrates
    on increasing the productivity of the crop and control of weather conditions but
    also takes responsibility about food security like storage transportation, etc.
    Shipping time, storage temperature and cloud-based records are monitored by this
    system. 3 Proposed System In the present system, we are using the crop field algorithm.
    So the resulting data is having the high accuracy about the environment, and also
    mainly we are using the message queuing telemetry transport (MQTT) instead of
    using the Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is MQTT is very much faster than the WSN.
    We are using this message queuing telemetry transport to transfer all the information
    about the climatic conditions are processed automatically, like if there is any
    possibility of rain in the weather cloud, then the climatic conditions and also
    the upcoming possibilities of the rain data log and also the current image of
    the environment will also be sent to the users mail. 3.1 Message Queuing Telemetry
    Transport (MQTT) Message queuing telemetry transport is a feather weight ISO standard
    publisher-subscriber messaging protocol specially designed for the internet of
    things. Internet of Things is creating the massive machine to machine network
    so that all of the devices like sensors, systems and also the actuators can connect
    to and communicate on the internet and with they need a communications protocol
    so that they can understand each other one of those protocols is message queuing
    telemetry transport. Message queuing telemetry transport is a TCP/IP protocol
    based on subscribe and publish messaging protocol designed for light weight machine-to-machine
    communications. MQTT has built the QoS to deliver the message. QoS 0: Once in
    a time “fire and forget,” if the device is online, it sends the message, and it
    gets delivered or if the device is offline it can’t be delivered it will be thrown
    away. QoS 1: Atleast once. QoS 2: Exactly once, 2 phase commit. Both the QoS 1
    and QoS 2 have the effectively guaranteed delivery, while the QoS 2 uses the two
    phase summit guaranteeing exactly once delivery and also it can give the end-to-end
    protocol level but not within the stacks on each side of the connection these
    QoS 1 and QoS 2 are queued for clients when the user is also online but have no
    timed out. To work the message queuing telemetry transport, it has three stages
    they are called as the message queuing broker. It is like a gateway receiver or
    server and allows the clients to send and also to receive the short messages from
    the broker only if they have subscribed to any topic like weather, temperature
    and also the humidity. Here in the below diagram, the client A is the publisher
    and the remaining client B and C are the subscribers whom receives the information
    which is sent by the sensor known as the client A. And also, these two B and C
    clients subscribe to the particular topic and gets published to the broker all
    the three will have the TCP connection with the broker as in Fig. 5. The sensor
    or the publisher which is called as the client A updates the topic and publishes
    the information about the topic to the MQ broker. These clients have subscribed
    to the topic so when the new piece of information gets published to the topic
    they then get the information from the MQ broker. Fig. 5 Message queuing telemetry
    transport Full size image 3.2 Sensor/Publisher The publisher has the information
    about the topic, and also this publisher has the data about the topic which the
    subscribers have been subscribed earlier. It is connected to the broker via TCP
    connections on all the sides whenever the new data comes, it will be sent to the
    broker. And also the publishers and also the subscribers are not connected directly
    through the TCP/IP connection. And this MQTT publishers allow username and password
    for the authentication and these clients can directly log on via password. These
    passwords are sent by the MQTT via the plain text or in encrypted form. If no
    data was sent, then the publisher will be in the off mode. The subscriber receives
    the filtered messages every message is being filtered by the broker which is the
    middle of the publisher and it also knows that who will send the message and also
    who will receive the message. The subscriber is the application based. The broker
    filter the messages based on the subject and the content based and also the type
    based filtering by the broker. A user can also subscribe to the one topics or
    more topics. When subscribed to the one or more than one topics two characters
    can be used. MQTT supports disconnect and last will and testament messages in
    this they are two types: namely hash character—multi-level wildcard and plus character—single-level
    wildcard MQTT. Clients which disconnect intentionally use disconnect message as
    in Fig. 6. MQTT broker will automatically publish last will and the testament
    messages on the behalf of the clients with unintentionally terminated messages.
    It also supports the retained messages which are automatically delivered when
    a client subscribes to the topic. Fig. 6 Block diagram of MQTT subscriber/client
    Full size image The topics which we select in the MQTT are similar to the files
    in a system using the forward slash(/). In message queuing telemetry transport,
    there is no formal structure to select the topic and a publisher is free to choose,
    it’s own topic names and also the structure but it should consists atleast on
    character to be valid. There is no topics created by the broker. All topics are
    created by a subscriber and also the publisher client, are not permanent. A topic
    only exists only if a subscriber has already subscribed to it before only or a
    broker has restore the last messages stored for that topic. This is the example
    for that E.g.: School/Room/Sensor. 4 Hardware Description Raspberry pi 3 begins
    as a toy computer and ends up being a real desktop PC having an upgraded ARMv7
    multicore processor and gigabytes RAM. In general, Raspberry pi has mode B and
    B+, mode A and A+, Pi zero. This Raspberry pi mode B and B+ are the simplest and
    cheapest but B+ has a bit more improved design of embedded applications. Raspberry
    pi zero has input or output, general purpose input or output (GPIO) and Bluetooth
    capability. They mostly operate at a frequency of 800–1000 MHz, in extreme case
    they can be operated upto 1500 MHz. In this model neither USB nor ethernet ports
    are changed. GPIO are the general purpose input and output pins which are used
    to turn off and to turn the devices like LED which will be present in the Raspberry
    pi. These pins allow you to connect and also to talk to the hardware modules that
    supports the protocol. UART is the universal asynchronous receiver and transmitter.
    It receives several bytes of the data from the GPIO pins but it transmits only
    bits of the data in the sequential order. In the asynchronous transmission of
    the data, it allows the bits to be sent or transmit without the sender but it
    will send the signal like the clock signal to the receiver side. UART can be used
    between the two devices only like simplex means data transmitted on one side only
    and also the half duplex in which the data can be transmitted in the either direction
    or the Full duplex. MPC3008 is a high performed and low power 10-bit analog-to-digital
    converter (ADC). In general to know the hotness as well as the coldness of an
    object, temperature sensor is used. In this LM 35 temperature sensor, the output
    is almost equal to the temperature. It doesn’t require any amplified output rather
    provides higher output than thermocouples. It is sometimes used as a power supply,
    battery, etc. To measure the amount of water in the soil moisture sensor is used.
    Indirectly either by using electrical resistance or neutron interactions water
    volume is measured. Light dependent resistor (LDR) is a variable light control
    resistor. As the light intensity increases, the resistance of LDR decreases. It
    can be used in circuits with light and dark activation switching and also in some
    light sensitive devices. 5 Results Figure 7 shows that the sensor parameters and
    also the weather conditions like temperature, moisture, humidity and also amount
    of light which is receiving. It compares the data log with the already existing
    weather reporting conditions. It also finds whether there is any possibility of
    the rainfall then it will intimates to the user through the registered mail. It
    will also predict the parameters like thunder storms, etc., as in Fig. 7. Fig.
    7 Message queuing telemetry transport conversation/data log Full size image These
    sensor values are being sent to the clients using the cloud and MQTT protocol.
    These parameters can be checked by the client through the registered mail. 6 Conclusion
    In this system, the irrigation system becomes more simple and easy with the quick
    transmission of the weather parameters by using the MQTT protocol and sending
    this data through cloud to the cloud who has been subscribed. The main advantage
    of using these protocol is when the client is not available then the parameters
    will be sent through the mail. When the client is available with the network then
    he can able to see the data parameters and also he can compare the present data
    with the existing data which has been already sent. So that the farmer will be
    able to know the changes in the atmosphere every day. This can also be implemented
    by using the computer-based algorithm and also the data can be processed without
    any further complexity. With the other specifications, sensors are used to make
    the process better. References J. Gutiérrez, J.F. Villa-Medina, A. Nieto-Garibay,

  description: Wireless sensor networks (WSN) are becoming a prominent technology

    (PA) is one of the venues that can significantly benefit from this technology
    in which high resolution data collection can be envisioned and thus enabling efficient

    and transmission of real-time data to facilitate decision-making directives, makes
    the WSN a perfect candidate for precision agriculture. In this paper, an agent-based
    architecture for precision agriculture (PA) is presented. Unlike traditional approaches,

    to facilitate real-time agricultural activities such as irrigation, fertilizer
    and pesticide application, for specific parts of a field proactively and in real
    time. An important issue within the PA environment is the heterogeneity and the
    diversity of the data. The data is collected from distributed heterogeneous devices
    and sensors that are interconnected through the Internet. These issues lead to
    the lack of the interoperability and thus make the task of processing, analyzing
    and interpreting of PA data, a challenging task. The proposed architecture was
    implemented using JADE (Java Agent Development platform) to support monitoring
    and control capabilities in precision agriculture environments.

    Precision agriculture (PA) utilizes modern technologies to provide valuable insights,
    treatment, operation management and decisions for quality crop production. The
    combination of Internet of Things (IoT) with wireless sensor networks (WSN) are
    the enabler technologies that contributes in making precision agriculture a reality.
    Features such as cost-effective monitoring, collection and wireless transmission
    of real-time data to facilitate decision-making directives, makes IoT and WSN
    perfect candidates for precision agriculture. PA is characterized by the spatial
    variations and the incessant dynamic changes of the environmental aspects as it
    varies from one field to another. Aspects such as soil, temperature, drainage,
    humidity, water and vegetation strongly affect crop growth and production. Although
    farmers and agriculturists are always aware of these factors, they were not able
    to quantitatively measure these environmental variations, predict outcomes and
    proactively take the appropriate actions. Various measurements readings provide
    useful guidelines to avoid water stress by projecting irrigation schedules improve
    production efficiency, product quality, and reduce the environmental impact. It
    is noteworthy that in such environments, the need for context-sensitive assistance
    and support that can autonomously plan timely directive actions and pre-emptive
    guidelines becomes a real vital necessity. Within the PA domain the approach will
    make the most of the WSN technology to provide services, expertise guidelines
    and farming relevant-information and hence will radically transform the way agriculture-related
    services are conceived and delivered. This paper presents a novel architecture
    that provides efficient means and decision-making mechanisms geared towards maximizing
    production and profits while taking into consideration the optimal utilization
    of various natural and artificial farming resources in precision agriculture.
    The architecture models PA entities as autonomous agents that collaborate to monitor
    soil, crops and climate in a farm field, and hence, provide timely decisions to
    facilitate real-time agricultural activities such as irrigation, fertilizer and
    pesticide application, for specific parts of a field proactively and in real time.
    Given the open, non-deterministic, and the dynamic nature of the entities participating
    in PA activities require the ability to change configuration according to their
    roles such as agronomists, inspectors, aquatic ecologists, foresters and Arborists.
    Moreover, farmers and agricultural personnel need spontaneous answers to various
    questions that are usually susceptible to a conjecture and speculation and prone
    to very intuitive analysis. It is clear that the design and implementation of
    solutions within distributed, open and heterogenous milieus such as the PA environments
    require a new modeling paradigm, integration architectures, and reliable uninterrupted
    self-configurable services. Such paradigm must describe the organization of the
    entities within the PA environment and the interconnection among them. Moreover,
    it must implement real-time smart monitoring to facilitate the various agriculture
    operations through managing the activities to enable the coordination amongst
    various PA entities and support the ad hoc and automated configurations. Given
    the aforementioned characteristics of the PA environment, agent-orientation is
    a suitable design paradigm as it provides the ability to monitor and coordinate
    PA tasks among services by providing adequate interaction mechanisms. Such paradigm
    enables modeling the nature of the PA environment being open, distributed, and
    heterogeneous environments in which an agent operates as part of a community of
    systems, as well as, human users. In this work, the notion of agent-hood is defined
    as a metaphorical conceptualization tool that captures, supports and implements
    features at a high level of abstraction (knowledge level), which is useful for
    the PA environment. These features are classified as primary features such as
    rationality and coordination; and secondary features such as intelligence and
    learning. The paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2, presents the evolution of
    the agriculture domain with the evolvement of technology, Sect. 3, presents agriculture

    and discussion. 1.1 Agriculture Evolution The practice of agriculture existed
    since ancient days where human nurtured lands and raised animals to survive. With
    the evolvement of technology, the agriculture domain has been adopting the existence
    of the current technology and evolved from manual processes to automated ones.
    Figure 1 presents the evolution of the Agriculture 1.0 to the current existence
    of Agriculture 4.0 based on the industrial evolution. Traditional agriculture1.0
    relied on simple tools, manpower, and animal forces with low productivity. In
    the 19th century, with industrial evolution of steam engines, the use of machinery
    that is operated by farmers in agriculture 2.0, as well as the use of chemicals.
    Fig. 1. Evolution of agriculture with the industrial evolution Full size image
    This allowed for an increase in productivity of farm operations, however, it brought
    to the agriculture domain other issues related to the field contaminations, destruction
    to the eco-environment, and waste of natural resources. In the 20th century, the
    evolution of computing with computer programs and robotics enabled the agricultural
    machines to perform farming operations efficiently and intelligently, and hence,
    the 3rd agricultural evolution (Agriculture 3.0). This allowed in the reduction
    of chemical usage by optimizing the use of machinery, as well as, the improvement
    in the precision of irrigation. Current technologies and techniques within the
    fourth industrial revolution such as Cloud Computing, Internet of Things (IoT),
    Big Data, Artificial Intelligence, and Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) allowed
    for more improvements to the agriculture domain and the existence of Agriculture
    4.0. Such technologies and techniques provide significant improvements within
    the agriculture domain in relation to the operation and the production. The work
    in [1] utilized IoT and WSN to optimize the production efficiency through efficient
    use of energy and water, as well as on maximizing on the agriculture quality,
    minimizing the impact on the environment. Moreover, the use of machine learning
    techniques in [19] to provide rich recommendations and insights for farmers to
    make adequate decisions within the agriculture domain. Other works looked into
    the efficient use of water for irrigation by utilizing IoT, WSN, and Cloud Computing
    [2, 20]. This paper explores the Agriculture 4.0 and the development of the smart
    system and devices using the multi-agent system paradigm with the support of the
    current existing technologies such the IoT, WSN, and Cloud Computing. 1.2 Agriculture
    4.0 Conceptual Model The conceptual model presents the required layer to deliver
    on agriculture 4.0 which enables precision agriculture. Figure 2 shows the architecture
    with the essential layer. The following subsections elaborate on the main functionalities
    of each layer and its contributions to enable the current agriculture 4.0. Fig.
    2. Agriculture 4.0 conceptual model Full size image Physical Layer. The current
    Industry 4.0 requires the definition of any object into the physical space and
    the digital space. The physical layer consists of domain related sensors (such
    as moisture sensor), transducers, and micro controllers/servers. The sensors provide
    the electrical signal readings within the agriculture environment. The electrical
    signals with the transducers are then shifted, scaled, and/or amplified with the
    micro controller/server digital, analog, and serial communication ports. Some
    decisions could be made with the aid of the micro controller/server device at
    the edge. such decision could be related to the operation of some of the resources
    related to the agriculture environment such as the irrigation system. The collected
    data from the physical layer is transmitted through the agriculture communication
    network layer through the supported protocols for the purpose of data storage
    and processing. Communication Layer. This layer is to make use of the adequate
    communication protocols and technologies in the transmission of the collected
    data from the sensor devices within the agriculture domain. This is an essential
    layer that provides the ability to connect the physical resources (in the physical
    layer) into the digital space. The digital space usually does not exist within
    the same network as the physical location of the farm, and hence, this requires
    access to the Wide Area Network (WAN). This can be either wired or wireless. Wireless
    communication network has been around for decades and has evolved from the first-generation
    to the current fifth generation of mobile communication network. Data Collection
    and Storage Layer. This layer provides the ability to collect, aggregate, and
    model the data captured from the physical layer. This data provides the ability
    for the control layer to provide the adequate decisions based on the collected
    agriculture data from the farmlands. The aggregated data may involve current collected
    data, as well as, historical data, depending on the model generated. Data from
    the agriculture domain can be either structured or semi-structured. Control Layer.
    This layer provides the ability to manage and decide upon specific criteria within
    the agriculture domain such as increasing productivity, allocating resources effectively,
    adapting to climate changes, and avoid food wastage. the layer contains Decision
    Support Systems (DSS) that provides the ability to provide the right decision
    as the right time depending on the implemented criteria. The DSS may utilize specific
    design paradigm and techniques for the agriculture domain such as Agent Oriented
    (AO) design paradigm and machine learning approaches that utilized current and
    historical data from the data collection and storage layer. Application Layer.
    This Layer Provides the Ability for the End User Within the Precision Agriculture
    to Interact with the System. The Layer Provides the Web Portal with the Exposed
    Services and Functionalities. Security Layer. This is an Essential Layer Since
    Each of the Aforementioned Layer Can Be Vulnerable to Various Malicious Attacks.
    Agriculture 4.0 Solutions Must Implement Security Practices to Protect the Full
    Environment from Information Disclosure, as Well as from Unauthorized Access,
    Improper Usage, Modification, or Destruction of Resources and Services. The Goal
    of the Security Layer is to Safeguard the PA Assets from Any Vulnerability Risks,
    Provide Confidentiality and Ensure the Integrity and the Overall Intrinsic Service
    Availability. These Goals Are Supported Through the Use of Authentication, Authorization,
    and Auditing Processes. 2 Enabling Technologies for Precision Agriculture With
    the rapid advancement in information technology, tremendous effort was devoted
    to developing new technological venues and design paradigms such as cloud computing,
    ubiquitous computing, and the context-aware computing in many application domains.
    Traditional agricultural management and processing methods need to be complemented
    by innovative sensing and driving technologies and state of the art technologies.
    Current trends of Agriculture 4.0 adopted innovative design and modelling paradigms
    as well as AI-based technologies. Precision agriculture is one of the promising
    application domains in which several technologies such as adaptive planning and
    scheduling, pattern recognition, neuron networks and machine learning models and
    methods, big data and predictive analytics were proposed [3, 9, 14, 25, 35]. Although
    more complex definitions exist, it was claimed that term of PA was first coined
    in 1997 by the US House of Representatives, in which the PA was defined as “an
    integrated information- and production-based farming system that is designed to
    increase long term, site-specific and whole farm production efficiency, productivity
    and profitability while minimizing unintended impacts on wildlife and the environment”.
    Within this context, Precision Agriculture is viewed as a farming management concept
    based upon monitoring, computing and responding to variability either in crops
    and produces or in aspects of animal rearing and cultivation [6]. While the focus
    of some definitions was impacted by the modern technical approaches on climate
    change, such as climate smart agriculture, for which the definition of the PA
    was aimed to develop the structural policies and the proper techniques that will
    achieve sustainable agricultural development to achieve food security under climate
    change. Other definitions envisioned that PA was not only restricted to the cropping
    systems per-se, but to include the entire agricultural production system such
    as animal industries, fisheries and forestry. Other approaches were proposed in
    the context-aware computing and grid computing based architecture [7, 17]. However,
    the main focus of these paradigms was geared towards the automation of collaboration
    activities and computation on a global scale. Several solutions were proposed
    to support agricultural activities and domain services that use real-time sensing
    networks for site sprinkle irrigation and control of watering via Bluetooth wireless
    technology [5, 11, 12, 18, 23]. Other approaches proposed several ways of controlling
    infertility through sensing capabilities and hence, the increase of soil fertility
    [13, 16]. Some of the existing approaches provide decision-based monitoring architecture
    for pesticide control and disease monitoring prediction that address climate change
    and hence, predict rampant pest outbreaks and diseases [6, 29, 30]. Observing
    climate and soil relative parameters such as humidity, temperature and plants
    moisture are used as vital indicators to the development of the disease in potato
    fields was exhibited with the utilization of wireless sensors. Phenomena such
    as the Internet of Things [31] and Big Data as well as the utilization of Cloud
    Computing resources and Artificial Intelligence techniques are gaining a prominent
    acceptance and expected to leverage the development of various precision agriculture
    application [32]. Massive volumes of various data can be captured, analyzed and
    thus used for better automated control and decision-making. Wolfert provides a
    comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art of big data applications in smart
    farming and identifies the related socio-economic challenges [34]. In spite of
    the prominent rapid development of computer technology, field measurements of
    agricultural environment parameters and spatial data collection still depend highly
    on human intervention, stationary sensors and very traditional data repositories
    such as data loggers, paper-based records and static storage sources which are
    labor-intensive and prone to very vital errors. In this work, Precision Agriculture
    is viewed as: an abstraction level at which the agricultural environment is viewed
    as a coherent universe that provides coordination solutions to a variety of agricultural
    entities in open distributed and heterogeneous settings. 3 Multi-agent Architecture
    for Precision Agriculture Farmers and agricultural personnel entities such as
    agronomists, inspectors, aquatic ecologists, foresters and arborists within a
    PA environment need spontaneous answers to various questions that are usually
    susceptible to a lot of conjecture and speculation and prone to very intuitive
    analysis. The main challenge in PA is how to adopt an adequate technology that
    provides means and mechanisms to improve field-level management with regards to,
    crop monitoring, farming practices and crop needs. Multi-agent design paradigm
    provides and improved integration architectures, and services for monitoring and
    control of the PA environment. Moreover, the multiagent design paradigm provides
    the ability to implement real-time smart monitoring to facilitate various agriculture
    operations and thus enables the interaction amongst various PA entities and supports
    the ad hoc and automated configurations. In the traditional point-to-point interaction
    patterns, entities engage directly with each other to satisfy controlled and directed
    coordination. It is clearly obvious that in such configuration is both inflexible
    and computationally expensive. For instance, there is no separation of concerns
    and responsibilities between the computation elements and the incurred required
    interactions and coordination. The lack of a distinct medium that deals solely
    with the coordination activities, imposes a considerable overhead on the entities
    in which they have to carry out the “interaction work” themselves to satisfy common
    or local task, in addition to their fundamental computational responsibilities.
    As an alternative, a capability-based coordination approach for interaction is
    a favorable and effective choice in which entities does not need to be concerned
    with how the interaction is performed or done. In this work, we consider the agent
    technology as the applicable medium that supports the coordination approach that
    is based on the capabilities of the agents within the PA environment. The notion
    of agent-hood is defined as a metaphorical conceptualization tool that implements
    features within the PA environment at a high-level of abstraction at the knowledge
    level. These features are classified as primary features such as rationality and
    coordination; and secondary features such as intelligence and learning. The multi-agent
    architecture for PA takes into consideration the creation of a smart environment
    with the ability to combine distributed information sources that may have different
    schemas. Furthermore, it provides a level of assistance to agriculturists through
    the ability to integrate distributed multi-modal sensors and actuators, and further
    analyze the integrated information. Such heterogeneity of the PA environment adds
    burden on fulfilling the interoperability among the different PA participants.
    Many semantic solutions were proposed in the literature in order to solve the
    problem of data heterogeneity and providing interoperability between the devices,
    sensors and relevant entities in PA, such as semantic annotations, linked sensor
    data, and ontologies. In addition, different information models might use different
    ontologies languages in terms of representations, which make the process of the
    semantic interoperability a complicated activity. Thus, our presented agent-based
    architecture defines an ontological view and representation that act as an explicit
    semantic ontology, which consequently provide meaningful integration processes
    such as matching, mapping, and aligning as well as enabling the interoperability
    among the PA entities. 3.1 Modeling the Precision Agriculture Smart Environment
    The architecture for a smart PA environment can be viewed as a multi-layered system.
    The nodes of a WSN are composed of sensors that collect data from the agriculture
    field. Sensors may also get data from other nodes by exchanging messages. The
    data obtained from the WSN describes how properties vary within agriculture fields.
    This information is then used to analyze and predict values that provide efficient
    control of important farming operations. The results of the interventions are
    monitored, recorded and used as a starting point to initiate the next crop cycle.
    From the collection and intelligent analysis of these parameters can then plan
    interventions such as fertilizers, irrigation and plant protection treatments
    tailored to the actual needs of the crop, which is implemented only when necessary.
    The positive effects of a site-specific management of agricultural practices affect
    not only the quantity and quality of products, but also a significant reduction
    in production costs and more effective action to protect the environment by reducing
    the use of pesticides. This approach also allows identifying and evaluating the
    risk indices plant pathology in order to implement appropriate strategies of “integrated
    pest management”. Figure 3 shows the proposed PA environment as a collection of
    software agents that interact autonomously and cooperatively analyze information,
    generate valuable decisions, and accordingly provide agricultural directives and
    guidelines. Fig. 3. Smart environment monitoring and control architecture for
    PA Full size image Agent-orientation provides the ability to develop entities
    that are able to detect and react to the nature of PA dynamic stimuli. Agent-hood
    features such as autonomy, reactivity and mobility drive certain desirable similarities
    with WSN. These similarities can be summarized as follow: Reactivity: Agents are
    able to detect and react to events, and external stimuli. Ability to work asynchronously:
    The agents come into operation, upon receipt of a stimulus. In PA, this feature
    favors the implementation of techniques to ensure that messages are asynchronously
    delivered and managed over the network. Autonomy: Agents have control over their
    actions and the various internal states without an intervention of humans. In
    a PA environment, this condition is very useful, since if any node in the network
    fails, the network must be able to meet its target objectives without impacting
    the overall common goals such as sustainability, availability and robustness.
    Communication capability: Agents need to interact and communicate to achieve their
    goals. The communication component defines the language and the set of protocols
    of exchanging messages. This ability is reflected in the distribution of information
    obtained from sensors or from other network nodes. Coordination and Cooperation.
    The agent must be able to perform tasks and coordinate their interaction through
    collaboration with other agents. The coordination defines both the system structure
    and the Interaction mechanism and the cooperation defines the policies that govern
    the interaction. Mobility: It is the ability of an agent to move around a specific
    network. The deployed node is in mobility to either track or get the data from
    a corresponding PA field. Agent Architecture. The agents of the PA environment
    are built on the foundation of Collaborative Intelligence Rational (CIR) agent
    architecture with the focus on utilizing the model to capture the participating
    agent’s behavior towards achieving the desirable goal. Each agent has two main
    components: 1) Knowledge Component, 2) Capability Component. Each component is
    designed according to the agent’s specific role [21]. The knowledge component
    consists of the following: The agent’s self-knowledge based on its role within
    the PA environment. The knowledge of the other agents within the PA environment.
    The specific goals to be satisfied within the PA environment. Possible solutions
    to satisfy each goal within the PA environment. The local history of the PA environment
    that consists of all possible local solutions for an agent at any given time.
    Agent’s desires commitments and intentions toward achieving each goal within the
    PA environment. The capability component consists of the following: The domain
    actions which contains the possible set of actions that impacts the state of the
    PA environment when executed. The communication where each agent within the PA
    environment sends and receives messages. The problem solver which consists of
    reasoning algorithms that are executed based on the role of the agent to satisfy
    its goal. The generated solution from the problem solver within the agent depends
    on the aforementioned knowledge component. From Fig. 3, we can observe the interdependency
    challenge among the Ontology Agent, Personal Assistant Agent, and the Gateway
    Agent. Interdependency is defined as a goal-relevant interrelationship between
    actions performed by various participating agents [22]. The coordination mechanisms
    reduce and resolve the issues associated with interdependencies. Furthermore,
    the agent’s interaction module identifies the type of interdependencies that exists
    within the PA environment and accordingly utilizes the suitable interaction device.
    The interaction devices are categorized as: Contract-based, includes the assignment
    device; Negotiation-based, includes resource scheduling, conflict resolution,
    synchronization, and redundancy avoidance devices [10]. The interdependency within
    the PA domain is classified as capability interdependency and the interaction
    device is the “assignment” device. The main function of the assignment device
    is to resolve problems associated with capability interdependencies. The basic
    characteristics of the assignment device are problem specifications and evaluation
    parameters. With reducing complexity in achieving a goal as the agent’s main objective,
    a solution can be selected based on the goal quality. The basic characteristics
    of the assignment device are problem specifications, evaluation parameters, and
    the sub-processes. The problem specifications might include, for example, the
    request, the desired-satisfying time, and the expiration time. A collection of
    basic components comprises the structure of the agent model and represents its
    capabilities. The proposed architecture defines three types of rational intelligent
    agents, namely: The Personal Assistant Agent (PAA), the Ontology Agent (OA) and
    the Gateway Agent (GA). Personal Assistant Agent (PAA): possesses the capability
    of three major components: 1) the communication component, 2) the analysis data
    component, and 3) the decision-making component. The role of the PAA is to formulate
    the agriculturists’ request and collects the various climates relevant readings
    obtained from the PA environment. Upon receiving these readings, the PAA analyses
    the information and determines the ideal settings and the possible recommended
    set of needed actions (for example, if the humidity or temperature exceeds/less
    than a predefined value, an action alert will be generated). In order for the
    PAA to capture the other agents’ model, it has to be able to communicate only
    about facts that can be represented and expressed in the defined ontology view
    and representation. In other words, agents need to adhere to the ontological semantic
    and structure. Moreover, in order for the PAA to fulfill this capability, it asks
    the Ontology Agent (OA) for the definitions and possibly requests translation
    of agricultural terms and concepts inherent is a specific request. Ontologies
    provide support for semantic data and semantic integration. However, there are
    many cases where organizational, cultural, or infrastructural constraints hide
    or even disallow the adoption of such semantic artifacts, in other words, there
    is a lack of explicit ontologies. Ontology Agent (OA): captures and defines the
    set of agriculture concepts, set of activities and domain events. It provides
    various abstract levels of domain knowledge within the PA related applications
    and hence derives the decision–making process. The corresponding ontology specifies
    a formal representation for the different agricultural concepts (semantic ans
    syntax) and the different relationships amongst these concepts. This ontology
    must be agreed and understood by the agent community that constitute the PA environment
    (or at least among its part) in order to enable each agent to understand messages
    from other participants. The formal precision agriculture ontology presented in
    this work adopts a similar structure defined by Goumopoulos [11] that can be formally
    represented as follows $$ PA_{Onto} = \\left( {Ont_{Des} , PA_{Concept} ,PA_{Relation}
    , Axioms} \\right) $$ The \\(Ont_{Des}\\) is a tuple that consists of the following
    elements: \\({ }Ont_{Des} \\equiv \\langle OntID,{ }DevId,{ }ver,{ }md{ }\\rangle\\),
    where \\({ }OntID\\) is the ontology name, \\(DevId\\) defines the device name,
    \\(ver\\) specifies the time of relevant to ontology creation and \\(md{ }\\)
    represents the source and the purpose of the ontology metadata information. The
    \\(PA_{Concept} { }\\) represents the PA set of concepts and terminologies; \\(PA_{Relation}\\)
    defines both the set of hierarchical and non-hierarchical relationships between
    the PA concepts and \\(Axioms\\) are these assertions (including rules) in a logical
    form. The representation of the PA Ontology captures the knowledge of various
    agricultural resources in terms of their classifications and descriptions. In
    this work, the knowledge representation of ontology adheres to the five-elements
    ontology approach, which can be formally, represents as follows: $$ Ont \\equiv
    \\left\\{ {C, Attr^{c} , Rel^{c} , Attr^{Rel} , H^{c} } \\right\\} $$ The \\(C\\)
    defines the set of agricultural concepts and terminologies; \\(Attr^{c}\\) is
    the set of all the possible states defined by the attributes of each concept;
    \\(Rel^{c}\\) is the set of relationships among the ontological agricultural concepts;
    \\(Attr^{Rel}\\) defines the various attributes of specific relationship along
    with the applicable multiplicities. All dependencies can be further viewed in
    terms of a generalization (is-a) or aggregation (part-whole) relationships; \\(H^{c}\\)
    specifies the concept hierarchy and its sub-elements. For example, the potato’s
    insecticide control ontology shall adhere to the aforementioned representation
    in which the elements will be defined as follows: \\(C\\) = {Plant, Insects, Pests,
    Insecticide, potato, Blister beetle, Aphid, Grubs, Russell Potato, White Potato,
    moisture, hydrometer} \\(Attr^{c}\\) = {(Name, Plant), (Reading, Moisture), (Poisoning
    percentage, Insecticide), (Color, Grubs)} \\(Rel^{c}\\) = {Kill (Insecticide,
    Aphid)} \\(Attr^{Rel}\\) = {((Name, (is-a), Plant)), ((Nutrients, (is-composed-of),
    ingredients))} \\(H^{c} \\) = {(Potato, Solanaceae), (Blister beetle, Insect),
    (Aphid, pests), (Herbicides, Insecticide)}. The Gateway Agent (GA): has the role
    of information gathering that receives sensors’ readings based on pre-set sampling
    intervals. For each sensor set, the GA is assigned the task of retrieving readings
    from the underlying scattered sensors based on the defined ontology. The GA monitors
    the status of the sensors and performs checking operations and set the data collection
    frequency. It is noteworthy that the PA environment encompasses different kinds
    of sensors with various specifications. The GA supports on-demand reading delivery
    as well as the full pre-defined measurement lifecycle. The knowledge component
    of the GA includes the sensors model available in the PA environment starting
    from the registration of physical sensor nodes as well as the addition or removal
    of a physical sensor. The knowledge component also contains a description of the
    sensors measuring capability, the agricultural terms understood and the description
    of the relationship between the concepts. The domain knowledge provides mappings
    models for transforming a domain queries into a set of queries to the appropriate
    target sensors. All these models need to be stated in an expressive common language
    that can allow capturing all the relevant distinctions amongst various terms and
    concepts as per the aforementioned ontology view. The gateway agent’s capability
    component identifies, dynamically selects the appropriate sensor and accordingly
    retrieves the relevant readings. Query processing requires developing a plan for
    obtaining the requested data. It is noteworthy, that the gateway agent also acts
    as a firewall and a proxy server to prevent unauthorized access to the private
    agricultural field network. 4 Agent-Based PA Implementation Directives The proposed
    architecture is validated by implementing the system of the PA in a real environment.
    The implementation of the system is viewed as a collection of tiers and layers
    with various autonomous agents that can act independently and cooperate in providing
    services and synergize agricultural environmental and spatial data according to
    mutual interests. The model provides querying ability and coordination activities
    that enhance the overall connectivity of distributed, autonomous, and heterogeneous
    WSN information sources in PA. In this work the Mote-View WSN package [4] was
    used as the “client tier” application interface for control and monitoring supervision
    for a specific topology of wireless sensors deployment [33]. 4.1 Hardware Specifications
    Two types of sensors were used; namely: the (MEP410) for microclimate and ambient
    light monitoring, and (MEP510) sensor, in addition to a gateway (MIP520) [33].
    The sensors and the gateway are installed with the distance between the nodes
    is 3.5 m. Each WSN package contains of the following: Radio Platform (PR2400CA):
    the platform is based on a low-power microcontroller (AtmelATmega128L) and runs
    MoteWorks [24] that is an end-to-end platform for the creation of wireless sensor
    networks applications and the processing of simultaneous radio communications.
    Data Acquisition Board (MDA300CA): a compliant data acquisition board that can
    adopt various types of sensors. The board contains standard environmental measurements
    sensors such as ambient temperature, humidity, soil moisture, leaf wetness and
    atmospheric pressure. Sensor Node: Each sensor node consists of 2.4 GHz MICAz
    mote, MDA300CA data acquisition board, Irrometer Soil moisture sensor, atmospheric
    pressure sensor MPX4115A, and leaf wetness sensor. The board is managed and controlled
    by an operating system (TinyOS). TinyOS is an open-source operating system designed
    for low-power wireless devices [28] and event-driven programming language [8].
    Sink Node: The Sensor –System interface is supported by MIB510, which provides
    data transfer and allows aggregation of sensor network data on different computer
    platforms via an RS-232 serial programming interface. Additionally, the sensor
    node (MICAz) acts as a base station when assembled with the MIB510 interface board
    [8]. 4.2 Software Specifications The Mote-View software framework is used for
    managing, monitoring, and visualizing sensor network deployments. The modules
    within the Mote-View client are conceptually viewed as a multi-tier-based architecture
    in which four layers provide dedicated services (see Fig. 4). Fig. 4. MOTE-VIEW
    client-tier abstraction of sensor network data Full size image A Data Access Abstraction
    Layer (data layer), comprises the PostgreSQL relational database [26] and captures
    various system data such sensors readings, and environment corresponding surroundings
    information as well as a real-time measurements’ readings. The Node Status and
    Configuration Layer (Node Layer) manages all the relevant sensor configuration
    and gets updates upon successful events that are sent from the data layer; Calibration
    and Conversion Layer which provides calibration and data conversion service to
    the measured parameters and uses calibration coefficients raw data readings. The
    Presentation layer provides a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for to provide users
    of wireless sensor networks an end-to-end management and supervision of a specific
    sensor’s deployment. Each layer includes a plug-in capability for providing modular
    extensions. The Mote-View package consists of the following modules. MoteViews:
    it is software used for collecting data from the nodes in different fields. XSniffer:
    Monitors the 802.15.4 wireless network packets. MoteConfig: it is a Windows-based
    GUI utility for programming Motes. This utility provides an interface for configuring
    and downloading pre-compiled XMesh/TinyOS firmware applications onto Motes. Cygwin:
    is a command-line interface. 4.3 Experiment Environment Setting The proposed architecture
    was tested under experimental conditions and was meant as a proof-of-concept.
    Two rows of shallow trenches, one meter apart was dug and seed potatoes half (½)
    meter apart were planted accordingly, each seed location is characterized by a
    soil moisture sensor. The temperature sensor was installed halfway between the
    two rows and mounds it against the plants, burying the stems halfway. A total
    of seven sensors (Mica2 motes) were organized in a parcel for monitoring the crop
    and recording the temperature and relative humidity. In order to maintain an effective
    network connectivity and reliable communication, the sensors were installed at
    a height of 50 cm. It is noteworthy that during the potatoes flowering, the radio
    range was dramatically affected and thus manual adjustments for the sensor’s heights
    were required. All the system settings, readings and corresponding sensors data
    were captured in multiple databases by using the PostgreSQL DBMS. The implementation
    utilizes the JADE platform [15]. JADE is a software framework geared towards developing
    agent applications in compliance with the FIPA specifications for multi-agent
    systems. JADE supports a distributed environment of agent containers and allow
    several agents to execute concurrently. The role of the PAA agent is to formulate
    the service requests, sends it out to all gateway agents and collects the required
    information, evaluates the received data, determines the applicable decision accordingly
    and notifies the corresponding agent about the outcomes. The knowledge component
    includes the agent’s self-model, model of gateway and ontology agents, and the
    local history. The main capabilities of the PAA agent include communication, reasoning
    and domain actions components. The PAA problem-solver component incorporates the
    Jade behavior classes (simpleBehaviors and cyclicBehaviors) that fulfill tasks
    such as registration with the directory facilitator (DF) service and to handle
    the various incoming messages and requests. The cyclic behavior class equips the
    PAA agent with ability to check for service results that have been sent by the
    gateway agents. The communication component inherits the jade.Core.Agent and jade.lang.acl.ACLMessage
    existing classes of the jade platform. These classes enable constructing ACL messages
    by utilizing the various FIPA performatives such as REQUEST, INFORM, INFORM-DONE,
    and QUERY-IF. The messages exchanged in the interaction contain a set of one or
    more message elements. The elements vary according to the coordination scenario;
    however, the only mandatory element in all the ACL messages is the performative.
    A message might additionally include the sender name or signature, the receiver
    and the possibly a content. Agents are able to get contents and set the content
    of a particular message by overriding the methods setContent and getContent. The
    coordination component uses the FipaContractNetBehaviour for the interaction and
    negotiation patterns based on the soliciting approach as in the case of the contract-net
    approach which depends on (1) the modeling approach for other agent’s capabilities,
    and (2) the solicitation approach for the local schedule and workload of other
    agents. To capture the PA ontology and to represent the domain knowledge, the
    Protégé [27] extendible framework is used in this work. The use of Protégé permits
    exporting the ontology in various formats such as OWL (Web Ontology Language)
    and RDF (Resource Description Framework). The JADE Abstract Ontology is implanted
    using the SimpleJADEAbstractOntology. For Frames ontologies, the SimpleJADEAbstractOntology
    is inherited and for the OWL ontologies, the OWLSimpleJADEAbstractOntoloigy package
    is imported. 5 Conclusions Precision agriculture is a new paradigm that is geared
    to accommodate the increasing demand for food and nutrient using state-of-the-art
    technologies. These technologies have emerged as a proper choice not only to make
    the agricultural activities simpler, but cheaper to collect and apply data, and
    to adapt to changing environmental conditions while using the resources most efficiently.
    The proposed agent-based monitoring and control architecture promotes innovative
    model that can protect field crops, manage and control real-time agricultural
    activities in a novel modern approach. The timely decisions exhibited by the modcel
    are very desirable fundamental directives for optimizing production activities
    of precision agriculture users. The architecture depicts a a promising trend in
    moving from an intensive-labor and time-consuming work to an automated, real-time,
    and cost-effective monitoring, control and decision-making architecture that can
    enhance the PA prospective and objectives. By utilizing the Agent-Oriented paradigm,
    the Precision Agriculture domain environment is modelled at a high level of abstraction
    and viewed collectively as a coherent universe of interacting and collaborative
    agents that provide high degree of decentralization of capabilities, which is
    the key to system scalability and extensibility. The ontology model specifies
    formal schemata and intelligent view for developing and representing efficient
    of agricultural knowledge across various agriculture information sources. It is
    noteworthy that the number of physical parameters that need to be observed and
    monitored can be captured by introducing relevant sensor types as long as these
    attached sensors are registered and initiated with the Gateway Agent (GA). Furthermore,
    the model can accommodate control-based sensors for actuators and motors which
    can be remotely switched on and off to perform automatic activities such as irrigation
    and pesticide spraying activities. The utilization of the WSN technology and the
    proposed model was realized and tested under lab conditions where physical parameters
    (such as soil temperature and soil moisture) can be easily captured and transmitted
    for further decision making. References Blackmore, S., Stout, B., Wang, M., Runov,

  description: An ecological irrigation district has emerged as the modern management
    with healthy ecosystems in precision agriculture. A health assessment of irrigation
    districts has been one of the most important operations for the decision-making
    on agricultural water management and pollution. In this study, a novel health
    evaluation was made on the ecological irrigation district using multisource data.
    A study area was selected as a part of the Yellow River basin, located at Helan
    County in Ningxia, China. A knowledge mapping was also applied to systematically
    sort out the index systems of comprehensive evaluation on the irrigation districts
    using a VOSviewer platform. The key indicators were then screened with a high
    co-occurrence frequency. An indicator system was constructed for the comprehensive
    evaluation of the ecological irrigation districts. Five categories of the primary
    indicators were divided in the indicator system, including the ecological environment
    (B1), the modernization of water transmission and distribution (B2), and the modernization
    of field engineering (B3), the modernization of production and management (B4),
    and production efficiency (B5). There was also 18 second-grade indicators in total.
    All indicators were classified into one to four levels of health. With the support
    of GIS, these indicators were quantified by combining the remote sensing data
    (LandSat8, MODIS) with research statistics and field trial data. The weight of
    each indicator was confirmed through Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). The evaluation
    data was divided by the scale of townships, where each administrative division
    was used as an evaluation unit. Finally, a fuzzy evaluation model was used to
    implement the comprehensive evaluation on the health level of the ecological irrigation
    district in the study area. The results show that there were large differences
    in the indicator B1 among the evaluation units, especially from the indicator
    of watershed area (C13) and the indicator of water quality in the main drainage
    ditches (C14), indicating a higher weight. At the same time, the degree of aridity
    (vegetation index VSWI) (C16) indicated a great potential to save water in the
    study area. Therefore, it was still encouraged to develop water-saving irrigation.
    More importantly, there were small differences in the indicators of B2, B3, B4,
    and B5 among the evaluation units, indicating the consistent upgrading of irrigation
    districts. Consequently, the highest value of health level (0.81) was found in
    Nanliangtaizi and Jingxing Farm, whereas, the lowest value was in Hongguang Town
    (0.69), where all evaluation units were in the range of health level 3 to 2. In
    addition, 0.325 of the irrigation districts were presented at the first level
    of health, whereas, 0.272 of the irrigation districts were at the second level,
    indicating an excellent operating condition. This study can provide a strong reference
    to efficiently construct the ecological irrigation districts in Northwest China.

    of water transmission and distribution (B2), and the modernization of field engineering
    (B3), the modernization of production and management (B4), and production efficiency
    (B5). There was also 18 second-grade indicators in total. All indicators were
    classified into one to four levels of health. With the support of GIS, these indicators
    were quantified by combining the remote sensing data (LandSat8, MODIS) with research
    statistics and field trial data. The weight of each indicator was confirmed through
    Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). The evaluation data was divided by the scale
    of townships, where each administrative division was used as an evaluation unit.
    Finally, a fuzzy evaluation model was used to implement the comprehensive evaluation
    on the health level of the ecological irrigation district in the study area. The
    results show that there were large differences in the indicator B1 among the evaluation
    units, especially from the indicator of watershed area (C13) and the indicator
    of water quality in the main drainage ditches (C14), indicating a higher weight.
    At the same time, the degree of aridity (vegetation index VSWI) (C16) indicated
    a great potential to save water in the study area. Therefore, it was still encouraged
    to develop water-saving irrigation. More importantly, there were small differences
    in the indicators of B2, B3, B4, and B5 among the evaluation units, indicating
    the consistent upgrading of irrigation districts. Consequently, the highest value
    of health level (0.81) was found in Nanliangtaizi and Jingxing Farm, whereas,
    the lowest value was in Hongguang Town (0.69), where all evaluation units were
    in the range of health level 3 to 2. In addition, 0.325 of the irrigation districts
    were presented at the first level of health, whereas, 0.272 of the irrigation
    districts were at the second level, indicating an excellent operating condition.
    This study can provide a strong reference to efficiently construct the ecological
    irrigation districts in Northwest China.   Keywords: remote sensing  /  ecology  /  irrigation

    The need to drive the technologies across the boundaries and to address the abundance
    of useful social applications and services in terms of business benefits is the
    vital reason for the integration of reliability and low latency in communication
    networks. The automated flying or driving, automation of factories, haptic communications,
    real-time healthcare using remote, and control in the industries are the major
    challenging applications of the ultra-high reliable low latency communication
    (URLLC). The URLLC is predicted to produce revolutionary advancements in the fields
    like smart grid, smart cities, trading using algorithms, smart farming, and remote
    manufacturing. Though some critical applications require short packets and low
    data rate transmission as predominant, the future data rate requirements can be
    fulfilled by the URLLC. The blooming of the services like virtual reality (VR)
    and augmented reality (AR), consumer robotics, high-precision broadband networks,
    gaming, and other entertainment at high definition made is operated at very low
    latencies of few milliseconds (ms). To cope up with the highly developing environment,
    there has been a valid and significant understanding found in the theoretical
    and practical development of the URLLC system’s implication. With the trade-off
    occurring between the throughput, probability of error, and delay in wireless
    networks, a strong interest and best understanding of the theoretical implications
    of URLLC are needed. The error trade-off includes queuing and coding delays. Though
    many analytically proposed approaches are available, there is not enough mathematical
    theory and fundamental limits to understand the low latencies in communication.
    The traffic in the network is heterogeneous and unpredictable. Thus, the overhead
    associated with the conventional theoretical framework for communication should
    be incorporated. The URLLC is like a roadblock for engineers, as it produces numerous
    challenges in network deployment, interface design, allocation of resources, and
    application layer core. The main requirement of reliable, efficient, and guaranteed
    low latency is 1. Designing of the system with throughput along with the holistic
    view is 2. Powerful network optimization algorithms are required for efficient
    and fast network functioning. The scenarios of the typical characteristics of
    the traffic are varying in terms of arrival models, QoS, and packet size in URLLC.
    Thus, in the development of the URLLC, these parameters should be considered Fettweis
    and Alamouti (2014), Steinbach and Liu (2016). The URLLC services that require
    low latency support are being provided using the long-term evolution (LTE) performance
    [LTE R14, 2016]. The reduction in long-term evolution (LTE), semi-persistent scheduling,
    grant-free access, and processing time reduction are found to the remedial parameters.
    There are many aspects of technically adding the cellular network that needs a
    careful design, and it includes symbol length, frame structure, scheduling policy,
    and subcarrier spacing and multiple-access scheme and link adaptation strategy
    URLLC (2016a, b), (3GPP TSG 1610366, 2016), and (3GPP TSG RAN WG1, 2016). Agriculture
    needs automation in the field of agriculture. There have been several types of
    research carried out in automation which is involved in irrigation and fertilizer
    automation. The automation of agriculture involves the application of wireless
    sensor network (WSN). The sensor network is the only resolution for precision
    agriculture realization using information technology (IT). The wireless sensor
    network contains mainly three components, namely, 1, gateways; 2, software; and
    3, sensor nodes. The sensor nodes are responsible for providing the data conditions
    from the environment. The data is transmitted to the processor wirelessly via
    gateways, and thus, they are displayed on the monitor with the help of the software
    [Susana et al. 2016]. The IoT application involves the IT and WSN’s basic principle.
    The internet acts as the intermediate medium for connecting the shared information
    and IoT. Thus, the IoT’s limitation is made to overcome by integrating the IoT
    along with cloud computing. This sharing of the data process involves the communication
    protocols LDhirani et al. (2017). IoT supporting protocol for the communication
    purpose includes the Message Queuing Telemetry (MQTT) transport. MQTT has some
    beneficial features in comparison with Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). This
    protocol is found to be simple and modern, capable of running in the low bandwidth
    providing low latency when compared to HTTP. The HTTP has an overhead protocol
    that is low Yokotani and Sasaki (2016). Literature survey There are many pieces
    of research being performed for automation in the field of agriculture. This involves
    the development of a smart irrigation system, smart fertilization techniques,
    smart farming system, etc. The pacing parameters of the subcarrier scalability
    for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing’s (OFDM) length of the symbol and
    slots minimizing involve compromising of numerous symbols [(TR 36.802, 2017),
    (TR 36.881, 2017)]. The enhancement in mobile broadband and numerous innovative
    ideas on URLLC is for utilization of the resource efficiently [(Multiplexing,
    2016), (eMBB & URLLC 2016a, b)]. The idea of the multiple-access protocols with
    the two-way grant-free access involves the reduction in the latency during uplink
    of the protocol [(NR Page, 2016), (Grant, 2016) & (M-sequences, 2016)]. The current
    3GPP LTE utilizes a fitting booking to use multi-users, adaptive modulation, and
    coding (AMC) as per channel quality data estimated at a recipient and hybrid automatic
    repeat and request (HARQ) for proficient retransmission to give high dependability
    just as high otherworldly productivity [Dahlman et al. 2011]. Nonetheless, such
    a methodology requires delays for channel quality measure and criticism, booking,
    and retransmission that it gets improper for conveying delicate data, even though
    it is the most proficient approach to convey inactivity uncaring data. Though
    some variety schemes and quick HARQ plans for better dependability at a low latency
    are thought of, for example, in Channel (2016), Uplink (2017), and Yeo et al.
    (2017), their unwavering quality levels and the subsequent otherworldly efficiencies
    are a long way based on what is needed for viable URLLC administrations. Further,
    the design of the physical (PHY) layer and medium access control (MAC) layer innovations
    for URLLC needs to think about the wide range of traffic qualities and the QoS
    of URLLC administrations. Since 2015, the creators had framed a joint URLLC research
    group and zeroed in on growing frightfully productive convention and numerous
    entrance innovations that ensure both tight low-idleness and ultra-reliability
    necessities for URLLC. With no instant channel content feedback or retransmission
    in obscuring networks, a lot of variation derived from massive amounts of opportunity
    is essential for ultra-reliability. In this regard, considering a large-scale
    receiving apparatus structure (LSAS) [or a large-scale various knowledge different
    yield (MIMO) system] is a typical outcome Marzetta (2010), Lim et al. (2015).
    In this article, several novel different accessibility plans for URLLC based on
    the LSAS are discussed, as well as signal multiplexing and full-duplex communication
    techniques to improve the unearthly competence and reduce inertness. Furthermore,
    by combining a structure-level evaluation method and a light following apparatus
    with computerized maps on real-world environments, another evaluation methodology
    is offered, as well as the demonstration assessment findings. System model The
    proposed system utilized ultra-reliable low latency communication techniques to
    provide a better communication convince in agricultural farms. Agricultural data
    are treated, collected, and monitored using wireless sensor networks. The sensor
    collects the informational data and transfers it to the cloud server. The information
    is shown on the web page that can be access with permission to the customers.
    A sensor node along with the actuators can control the unwanted environmental
    conditions. The update in the web content information in regard to an agricultural
    field can be notified to the users. The proposed framework is shown in Fig. 1.
    Fig. 1 The proposed receiver filter framework Full size image Wireless sensor
    networks are the most preferred in most of the contemporaneous applications, namely,
    micro-electromechanical system technological field, digital electronics, and wireless
    communications. The wireless mode of communication is achieved only using the
    wireless sensor networks that include the sensor interacting with the environmental
    conditions to collect, process, and communicate. Since very less amount of wiring
    is carried out for the wireless sensor network, therefore the cost of wiring is
    also low. The essentially important data are stored in the cloud service of the
    Internet of Things via the wireless sensor networks with the Internet source.
    A wireless sensor network with the Internet of Things includes sensing units,
    processing units, transmission units, and power units. Algorithm of the proposed
    system: Step 1: Placement of sensors SHT3x – Humidity and temperature monitoring
    TSL 2561x – Light intensity TDS – Plant Level Step 2: Store sensed data in memory
    unit Step 3: Sensor - MCU Link establishment Step 4: Enter operational mode Step
    5: Transmit and Receive data Step 6: Continuous logging and Monitoring Step 7:
    Calculate yield and quality In the sensing unit, environmental provision is monitored
    using the sensor nodes. The proposed architecture consists of three sensors, namely,
    SHT3x, TSL2561 sensor, and TDS sensor. The temperature and humidity are predicted
    using SHT3x, TSL2561 is used to predict the light intensity, and plant nutrients
    level is determined using a TDS sensor. The processing unit is also known as a
    memory unit. The microcontrollers inbuilt in the processing unit consist of a
    large memory space in which the program is loaded to transfer the corresponding
    commands to the other devices that are linked with it. The configuration of the
    connected devices is sensors and actuators. The microcontroller controls the sensor
    nodes and enables the communication interaction with the Internet of Things, whereas
    the actuators control the surrounding environment. The transmission and receiving
    of data from wireless sensor network devices are monitored and controlled in the
    transmitting unit. In the proposed system, a Wi-Fi hotspot router is used for
    an Internet source to connect the sensor nodes with the cloud service. Wireless
    sensor network-based agricultural farms installed AC power for energy source and
    come under the power unit. Actuator devices required AC power, whereas DC power
    is needed for processing devices. A sustainable wireless sensor network framework
    system performs efficiently using an AC power source. A wireless sensor network-based
    agricultural farm acquires an optimal and sustainable benefit. Environmental changes
    such as climate, plant physiology, hydrology, and pest are regularly monitored
    in agricultural farms using wireless sensor network devices. The sensor nodes
    in WSN suggest the farmers use a limited range of fertilizers, pesticides for
    an input seed. The agricultural machinery data are collected and controlled using
    WSN. The proposed system is applicable for many contemporaneous applications,
    namely, monitoring plant status, fertilizer management, irrigation pattern, controlling
    pest, and promoting autonomous harvesting. The structure of wireless sensor network
    is shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 2 Wireless sensor network Full size image The Internet
    of Things allows the user in accessing the tools from anywhere at any time by
    connecting the user’s devices with cloud service via the continuous Internet source.
    The constraints of IoT devices are handled via the cloud on an IoT platform that
    enables the storage space and computation of resources. The protocols available
    in the cloud communication system require only a minimum level of bandwidth and
    low-energy consumption. Clients, servers, subscribers, publishers, and topics
    are handled by the protocol. As per the request from the user, the protocol is
    responsible in receiving and transferring the messages. The publisher complains
    about the issues faced through the server, whereas the subscribers are also known
    as a client who receives the requested topics from the server. Ultra-reliable
    low latency communication technique is utilized in agro-meteorological wireless
    sensor networks in acquiring information to handle the farm efficiently. The sensor
    nodes in wireless sensor networks provide a limited level of preprocessing, and
    this blocks signal conditioning, filtering, and detection. This applies to agro-meteorological
    attributes and their corresponding relationships. The implementation of this technique
    improves the network lifespan. The proposed system model in the agricultural field
    can identify the disease of the plant. Ultra-reliable low latency communication
    technique efficiently handles a huge amount of data obtained from the wireless
    sensor networks in farms supporting the farmers in deciding about the concern
    in informational data. Rainfall pattern, water supply to the plants, and fertilizers
    usage can be analyzed through the proposed system. This promotes the increased
    yield production and the quality of plant crops. Result and discussion The performance
    of the proposed system model is attained using the two-dimensional regular cells
    along with the 2-D stochastic wireless fading channel. The proposed technique
    is more apt for various contemporaneous applications due to the installation of
    more antennas and small cells. The evaluation of long-term evolution (LTE) technologies
    is attained using the 3GPP 3-D spatial channel model. This 3-D is obtained from
    the 2-D channel model using stochastic channel parameters. The transmitter and
    receiver pairs are selected depending based on scenario-dependent parameters via
    the 2-D regular layout. Depending on the desired pair and interfering sources,
    the sensor nodes are placed. Enlarged agricultural land area is provided with
    the continuous network with some geographical characteristics goal including landforms,
    shape, and other surrounding factors. The map-based channel model is enhanced
    using the ray-tracing tool brought attention to all contemporaneous applications.
    The performance of the proposed system is evaluated using the hardware test calculation
    in association with the link-level simulations (LLSs) and SLSs. UL multiple-access
    and DL waveform multiplexing performance are evaluated using a high-resolution
    digital map. The placement of antennas at a respective height at a tilting angle
    is considered for generating information to the users about each part of the agricultural
    farm through digital mapping. With the parameters of the 3-D channel, a digital
    camera installed in the farm using the ray-tracing tool is known as wireless sensor
    networks. As per the deterministic model with the specified transmitter and receiver
    pair or a stochastic model, a 3-D wireless channel is provided. Synchronization
    of frequency and time is manipulated with the permission provided to all individual
    users of downlink (DL). Various methodologies and filtering waveform along with
    the multiplexing waveform perform the synchronization process on the sub-bands.
    Thus, the synchronization for downlink has increased performance efficiency. A
    long-term evolution for enhanced mobile broadband and low latency communication
    (URLLC) services requires a steady synchronization time for a closed-loop system.
    URLLC services require a high-frequency band and mobility rate as the synchronization
    time error, and offset frequency arises due to Doppler shift reduces the performance
    rate of URLLC services. Sporadic access is required to have an increased reliability
    rate of URLLC services, and therefore, the receiver is provided with the interference
    cancellation approach. Multiple users in closed-loop time synchronization are
    estimated with the various time and offset frequencies. To overcome the challenges
    in time and frequency offset caused due to the interference of multi-users with
    the high mobility rate, sporadic access, and the receiver filter, the evaluation
    of time and frequency offsets is necessary. For this would maximize the signal-to-interference
    ratio (SIR), which has improved the performance in comparison with another approach.
    The downlink agonizes from interference which is caused by the uplink (UL) in
    a full-duplex cellular communication. Proper management of interference is required
    to improve the performance of the user’s rate distribution. Self-interference
    cancellation (SIC) is the basis in association with the management of interference.
    Uplink interference in code-division duplexing spatial division multiple-access
    (CDD-SDMA) in null space orthogonal is arranged. Downlink multiuser multi-input
    multi-output (MU-MIMO) is arranged in a signal subspace via the enhancement of
    antenna configuration and orthogonal codes among downlink and uplink. With the
    support of this alignment, uplink interferences are converted into a downlink
    single dimension space signal. The feasibility of communication in an agricultural
    farm is achieved using a spatial channel model. The frequency range for the uplink
    communication users is also attained using the adjacent channel interference along
    with the in-band blocking. An analog to digital converter and interference co-channel
    is inbuilt in resource block producing a finite resolution output. The contemporaneous
    agricultural application system practically achieves an increased spectral efficiency.
    Even in non-ideal effects, the proposed system shows improved performance, doubling
    the rate of spectral efficiency with the simultaneous reduction in delay among
    uplink and downlink. The comparative analysis of CDD-SDMA with half-duplex is
    shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 3 Comparative analysis of CDD-SDMA with half-duplex Full
    size image Ultra-reliable low latency communication technique for agricultural
    wireless sensor networks is shown in Figs. 4, 5, 6, 7 to 8. These graphs display
    information acquired from agricultural fields to consumers or farmers through
    communication, allowing them to avoid planting crops, improve output rates, and
    connect with consumers. Waveform with effective synchronization strategy is required
    for radio resource communication. To improve the spectral efficiency, delay spread
    and mobility with multiplexing concept are required. The different types of waveforms,
    namely, filtered orthogonal frequency division multiplexing and generalized frequency
    division multiplexing, are multiplexed with cyclic prefix length, filter length,
    and subcarrier spacing. Fig. 4 Performance evaluation of generalized frequency
    division multiplexing Full size image Fig. 5 Performance evaluation of generalized
    frequency division multiplexing with weighted parallel interference cancellation
    Full size image Fig. 6 Performance evaluation of generalized frequency division
    multiplexing with filter Full size image Fig. 7 Performance evaluation of orthogonal
    frequency division multiplexing with filter Full size image Fig. 8 Performance
    evaluation of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing Full size image The proposed
    system provides the communication with the wireless sensor network requiring Internet
    sources. For an effective URLLC performance, waveform multiplexing with the frequency
    offsets and time synchronization is introduced. Thus, the proposed system is feasible
    in providing a URLLC Internet service in the agricultural field. Figure 6 gives
    a clear view on the performance of the proposed system using the frequency division
    multiplexing. The spectral efficiency of the system increases linearly when the
    signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is increased. Figure 7 shows the clear view that when
    using the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing with filter, the spectral
    efficiency of the system increases linearly up to SNR of 20 dB and remains constant
    with higher SNR. This shows that the proposed system’s efficiency becomes constant,
    thus providing constant stability and reliability. Figure 8 shows the spectral
    efficiency of the proposed system when using the orthogonal frequency division
    multiplexing. The spectral efficiency of the system increases linearly up to SNR
    of 15 dB and provides very less increase with higher SNR. This shows that the
    proposed system’s efficiency becomes constant, thus providing constant stability
    and reliability. Thus, by using the OFDM in the proposed system for transmitting
    the data collected in the transmitting unit, the system’s efficiency is found
    to be improved. Figure 9 shows the comparison of the above discussed techniques.
    Among them, OFDM variants and generalized FDM with filter produces higher spectral
    efficiency. Since filter component introduces further complexity and introduces
    latency, a trade-off has been made to select OFDM variants for SDD-CDMA techniques
    for URLLC link communication. Fig. 9 Comparison SDD-CDMA techniques Full size
    image Conclusion In this paper, novel URLLC procedures were presented for acknowledging
    Tactile Internet administrations in sensible conditions. The traffic attributes
    and required QoS of regular URLLC (or Tactile Internet) administrations in writing
    were summed up and characterized from the viewpoint of planning the PHY and MAC
    layers of a cell framework. Examinations on traffic in ordinary use cases defended
    the need of characterizing new client states and conceiving conventions for multiplexing
    of various access plans over radio assets to meet a wide range of traffic attributes
    and QoS of URLLC administrations and the improvement of ideal radio asset of the
    executive techniques to amplify the proficiency while ensuring the inactivity
    and dependability necessities. The MQTT convention merits suggested as a correspondence
    convention for the utilization of remote sensor networks for accuracy. This is
    identified with information correspondence continuously. In this examination,
    the MQTT convention can send sensor information roughly 1 s. This time relies
    upon the capacity to download and transfer from each organization supplier. To
    execute the proposed conventions and different access plans in a frightfully effective
    manner, more PHY innovations on waveform multiplexing and synchronization procedure,
    channel codes for low latency and high unwavering quality, and a novel DL/UL MU-MIMO
    idea joining obstruction arrangement for a functional full-duplex cell correspondence
    were additionally presented. Change history 11 November 2023This article has been

    precision agriculture 1. Introduction As a great part of agricultural produce
    is intended for human consumption, the quality of the water utilized for irrigation
    is essential. However, water quality may be affected by many aspects such as pollution
    from industries, agricultural fertilizers and pesticides, and waste produced by
    humans. UNESCO estimates the amount of contaminated water on the planet as 12,000
    km3 [1]. Poorer regions of the planet are the most affected by contaminated water.
    Contaminated water is able to cause numerous health problems in the population.
    The WHO estimates the number of deaths caused by contaminated water consumption
    to be 842,000 [2]. Furthermore, it is estimated that there are 200,000 deaths
    per year due to pesticide consumption, with nearly 3 million people poisoned per
    year [3]. In India, 29% of the pesticide consumption is used on rice and 9% is
    used on vegetables. Thus, it is imperative to assure irrigation water is treated
    correctly so as to reduce water pollution as much as possible. Considering the
    repercussions of water contamination on people, it is necessary to add a treatment
    process in irrigation systems. Even though irrigation water may have been treated
    prior to distribution, the characteristics of the distribution canals may not
    avoid the incursion of water pollutants during water transport. There are a variety
    of water treatment processes, including advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) [4],
    and adsorption, both organic and inorganic, among other water treatment processes
    [5]. Biosorption is a physical wastewater treatment that employs biomass to adsorb
    chemicals, metals, and other pollutants [6]. This process may employ different
    types of biomass such as marine algae, bacteria, fungi, peat moss, bark, and yeast
    and each type may present better results with different types of pollutants [7].
    Agricultural waste materials are also being considered as an economic and ecologic
    biomass source. Agricultural waste biomass is abundant, reduces the waste generated
    from agriculture, and it has a low cost and high efficiency as an absorbent. Some
    of the already tested agricultural waste biomass absorbents are sawdust, coconut
    shells, rice bran, wheat bran, sugarcane bagasse, sugar beet pulp, maize corn
    cob, orange peels, waste tea leaves, and hazelnut shells, among other agricultural
    waste from different produce types [8]. The remnant of the wastewater biosorption
    process is treated with anaerobic digestion, dewatering, incineration, thermal
    drying, or pyrolysis [9]. In order to include water treatment in irrigation systems,
    an evaluation of the quality of the water that reaches the irrigation system must
    be performed before irrigation. Water quality monitoring can be performed with
    chemical or physical sensors. Physical sensors allow monitoring water quality
    in real time and do not require continuous supervision and manipulation. Thus,
    physical water quality monitoring sensors are suitable for remote water quality
    monitoring in smart irrigation systems. Physical sensors use the electromagnetic
    field, optical properties, and resistance variations in order to assess changes
    in the characteristics of the monitored environment [10]. Therefore, optical sensors
    can be utilized to monitor turbidity or the presence of an oil layer. Coils can
    be employed to determine the conductivity of the water. Moreover, image processing
    performed on the images obtained from cameras can be utilized to detect the presence
    of objects or animals. Furthermore, currently available low-cost sensors can be
    used to monitor water quality, with results comparable to those obtained from
    more expensive commercialized probes for water quality assessment. The amount
    of information generated from these types of sensors and smart systems applied
    to precision agriculture can be significantly large. Thus, data processing algorithms
    are necessary to analyze the data and determine the actions that the actuators
    must perform. These algorithms may also consider reducing the amount of forwarded
    data in order to reduce energy consumption and the amount of generated traffic.
    Fault tolerance is another aspect that is usually considered by the algorithms
    employed in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and Internet of Things (IoT) solutions.
    Moreover, some solutions consider soil moisture and other factors such as weather
    predictions to determine whether the irrigation system must start or stop [11].
    In this paper, a communication protocol and a data analysis algorithm for a wastewater
    treatment system intended for irrigation are presented. Our system includes a
    smart group-based wireless sensor network that is able to detect, locate, monitor,
    and track high salinity levels and pollution stains, such as oil spills. Moreover,
    a new kind of water treatment plant is proposed to depollute the water before
    the irrigation. The system will use artificial intelligence techniques and data
    fusion methodologies in order to quantify the amount of pollution in the source
    and to detect and predict its movement and form. These techniques will allow the
    system to be conscious of what is happening in the water environment and send
    alarms through the warning system. This information will be used to define one
    treatment or other before using the water for smart irrigation. The rest of the
    paper is organized as follows. The description of our proposal is given in Section
    2. The results are presented in Section 3. Section 4 discusses the related work.
    Finally, the conclusion and future work are presented in Section 5. 2. Materials
    and Methods In this section, the different nodes, sensors, and actuators proposed
    to collect data from the field and carry out the corresponding actions that allow
    treating the water are described. Furthermore, the architecture, the proposed
    communication protocol, and a data analysis algorithm for a wastewater treatment
    system intended for irrigation are presented. 2.1. Node Description In this subsection,
    the description of the characteristics of the node, the sensors, and the actuators
    are performed. In our proposed system, the nodes are deployed throughout the expanse
    of the canals, both for urban areas and farming areas. The quantity of nodes depends
    on the number of canals and their specific needs. The employed nodes are Arduino
    Mega 2560 [12]. The node has 16 analog input pins and 54 digital input/output
    pins, allowing for connecting many sensors to one single node. Moreover, it provides
    a universal serial bus (USB) connection, 4 universal asynchronous receiver-transmitter
    (UART) serial ports, a power jack, a 16 MHz crystal oscillator, an in-circuit
    serial programming (ICSP) header, and a reset button. However, as the node does
    not provide an integrated wireless interface, it is necessary to incorporate wireless
    modules. The nodes can be provided with long-range wide area network (LoRaWAN)
    connectivity by employing the module F8L10D-N [13] which transmits in the 868
    Mhz band. The sensor used to monitor water quality will be used to monitor turbidity
    and conductivity. For the detection of turbidity, optical sensors are used, while
    for conductivity monitoring, inductive sensors are used. The turbidity sensor
    is based on that presented in [14]. It is made with two light emitting diodes
    (LED) that emit at different wavelengths and two light detectors. One of the LEDs
    has a maximum wavelength of 612–625 nm and the other of 850 nm. The light detectors
    are a light-dependent resistor (LDR) that responds to the visible light of the
    first LED and a photodiode that responds to the infrared (IR) light of the second
    LED. The turbidity sensor is placed before and after the application of the filters
    to treat the water. The LEDs are powered at 3.3 V using the 3.3 V output voltage.
    The conductivity sensor is based on the prototype described in [10]. It is composed
    of two copper coils. The first coil is powered with a sine wave and the second
    coil is induced. The induced voltage depends on the conductivity of the water.
    The powered coil is powered with the Arduino using an analog output (PWM) pin.
    The generated voltage in the induced coil is measured. Both the turbidity sensor
    and the conductivity sensor are connected to the same node. They are placed before
    and after the filters and will monitor the correct operation of the wastewater
    treatment filters by registering the changes in water quality. Additionally, we
    use a sensor to detect the presence of hydrocarbon in the water. The sensor is
    based on the photoluminescence effect linked to the hydrocarbons. In the design
    of the sensor, different light colors are used to excite the molecules of a hydrocarbon.
    The light source is an LED and a photodetector is used as a receptor of the emitted
    light. In order to execute the actions determined by the system, some nodes need
    to include an actuator. As an actuator connected to an Arduino node, a linear
    actuator can be utilized. The linear actuator is a device that converts the rotational
    motion of a low-voltage direct current (DC) motor into linear motion. This device
    can be utilized to open and close the gate for controlling the water in the canal.
    2.2. Architecture In this subsection, the proposed architecture is presented.
    The example of the area where the nodes are to be deployed is presented in Figure
    1. As it can be seen in the image, there are several urban areas. These areas
    are zones with a population that may discharge wastewater into the canals that
    transport the water to the fields and is therefore subject to spill control. Furthermore,
    these areas have access to the electricity grid and the telecommunications infrastructure.
    The other area is the canal area. This area is located in an irrigation canal
    that leads to the fields. As it can be seen, in the canal areas, there is a comb-shaped
    structure that is formed by auxiliary canals that are connected with one another
    and have several gates that connect to the main canal. These auxiliary canals
    are prepared to implement the biosorption process that treats the water and removes
    contamination. Figure 1. Deployment of node areas. The sensor nodes deployed within
    the different zones communicate through wireless connections. Moreover, the communication
    between each of the zones is established wirelessly as well. In one of the urban
    areas, which in Figure 2 is called Urban Area 0, the gateway will establish a
    wired connection to transmit the data to the data center for storage and data
    analysis. The data that are received with information from the different nodes
    will be treated with artificial intelligence (AI), to respond with appropriate
    measures in our system. Lastly, the adopted measures will be forwarded to the
    actuator nodes to let the contaminated water go through the biosorption process.
    Figure 2. Example of canal zone in detail. Figure 2 allows for visualizing in
    greater detail the location of the nodes in one of the canal zones. As can be
    seen, there are nodes to which different types of sensors and actuators are connected.
    Several auxiliary canals are found as well. These are comb-shaped canals where
    the biomass is located. The biomass is responsible for the decontamination of
    the water. As seen in the image, the biomass canals are replicated and connected,
    so the water can go through one or several decontamination phases, depending on
    the results of the samples obtained by the sensors, which are located at the end
    of each biomass canal. The actuator nodes are connected to lock-gates that allow
    for regulating the passage of the water flow. The proposed architecture, formed
    by three layers, being Nodes Sensors & Actuators, Storage & Activation, and Artificial
    Intelligence, is shown in Figure 3. In the Nodes, Sensors & Actuators layer, all
    the nodes of the network are located. The different sensors that take measures
    of the water quality are connected to the nodes. Then, the data are periodically
    forwarded to the data center situated in the upper layer, where the data are stored.
    Furthermore, the actuators are connected to the nodes that are located at the
    gates of the canals so that the appropriate actions that have been decided in
    the higher layers are performed. Figure 3. Proposed architecture. On the other
    hand, the Storage & Activation layer hosts the devices where the information received
    from all the sensors is stored. Furthermore, this layer also hosts the system
    that allows for sending orders to the actuators so as to carry out the actions
    established by the decision-making process that is performed in the upper layer.
    Lastly, the systems that allow for processing the data that were stored in the
    lower layer are located in the Artificial Intelligence layer. This layer oversees
    the decision-making process whose result will be sent to the action functionality
    in the lower layer. The protocol stack is presented in Figure 4. As it can be
    seen, the Network Interface layer uses an ethernet protocol in the wired network,
    and a LoRaWAN protocol to perform wireless transmissions. The wired network is
    based on the stack defined by the transmission control protocol/internet protocol
    (TCP/IP) reference model. IPv4 and IPv6 protocols are used in the Network layer.
    The protocols TCP and user datagram protocol (UDP) are used in the Transport layer.
    Finally, the Application layer can use any protocol of this layer to implement
    the proposed system. On the other hand, for the wireless network, the physical
    layer utilizes the LoRa modulation. Then, the Medium Access Control layer utilizes
    LoRaWAN. Lastly, the Application layer employs the proposed protocol. Figure 4.
    Protocol stack. 2.3. Proposed Algorithm In this subsection, the performance algorithm
    of the elements of the proposed system is presented. The proposed algorithm has
    been divided into two parts. The first part shows the algorithm used by the sensor
    nodes to obtain the data and transmit them to a central node. This node is called
    Central Node and it is located in Urban Area 0, from which the data and alarms
    are sent to the AI and storage systems. The second part presents the manner in
    which the data are stored in the Storage Server and treated in the AI computers
    so as to later send the response action to the actuator nodes. The algorithm presented
    in Figure 5 shows the operation process of a group of nodes. As can be seen in
    Figure 2, a sensor node is not deployed on its own but in a group of three nodes
    that measure at the same point. This group is formed by one sensor node named
    Central Node, and two more sensor nodes. All sensor nodes are capable of detecting
    different parameters related to water pollution. All the sensors connected to
    the nodes take measurements every minute. If there are variations with respect
    to the reference values, the data are sent to the Central Node of the group, and
    at the same time the data are stored in the SD card. In addition to performing
    the usual functions of any other sensor node, distributed Central Nodes are responsible
    for sending data and alarms with information from any node in their group. These
    alarms and information are forwarded to the Central Node located in Urban Area
    0, via wireless communication. This grouping of nodes allows for guaranteeing
    fault tolerance. If only one node detects pollution, the node sends an update
    to the Central Node of their group, and this Central Node checks if itself or
    the other sensor of the group has also detected pollution. If pollution is not
    detected by more than one node, it is considered a false positive. Figure 5. Algorithm
    for node groups. All the groups of nodes located in the different areas, urban
    or canal, can send updates to their Central Nodes via wireless communication.
    The Central Nodes send the information, via wireless communication as well, to
    the Central Node of Urban Area 0. The Central Node of Urban Area 0 is responsible
    for sending all information and alarms collected in all areas to the data center
    through a wired/wireless transmission medium. The data center is primarily responsible
    for storing the data, which can be consulted at any time, and generating analytical
    and machine learning models. In addition, it is also responsible for generating
    the actions that the actuator nodes must take. Generally, the action resulting
    from the detection of an alarm is associated with the start-up of one actuator
    node at least in one area. When the Central Node of Urban Area 0 receives an alarm,
    if it is known and has been previously treated, this node decides an action and
    makes an order to the actuator nodes so that the corresponding action is carried
    out. Moreover, the Central Node of Urban Area 0 sends the alarm to the storage
    and AI data analysis system. The second algorithm that we propose so as to store
    the data and alarms that are generated in the sensor nodes is provided in Figure
    6. Once saved, they are processed by AI and then the decisions that are made are
    forwarded to the actuator nodes. Figure 6. Algorithm for storage data, obtain
    patrons’ big data and take decision to actuator nodes. Initially, when the data
    are received in the Storage Server, the system must differentiate if it is an
    alarm or if it is the data that have been obtained during an observation period.
    In case of an alarm, the received data will be tagged before being stored. If
    it is not an alarm, the data are stored directly. Then, they go to the computer
    where they are treated by AI. In this way, patterns of behavior can be detected.
    Depending on the problems that can be detected and the place where actions should
    be applied, several decision rules have been created. Those rules are applied
    based on the detected patterns. Finally, the decisions that have been made based
    on the rules are sent to the actuator nodes so that they are put into action in
    an appropriate manner. 2.4. Protocol Description In this subsection, the protocol
    utilized to make the proposed system work is presented. Our proposed protocol,
    as can be seen in Figure 7, is divided into four fundamental phases, which are:
    Discovering Neighbors, Send Data, Storage and Data Processing, and Action. As
    its name suggests, in the Discovering Neighbors phase, the different sensor nodes
    send wireless signals to discover the nodes that are part of the group. Then,
    the sensor nodes determine the Central Node, and the Central Node identifies the
    gateway which is the Central Node in Urban Area 0. Therefore, a LoRa multi-hop
    network is established as in [15,16]. Figure 7. Proposed protocol. Once the nodes
    are activated and their connection is established, they go into the Send Data
    phase. The different sensors that are connected to each node begin to measure
    their respective parameters. The data collection period has been set to take place
    every minute. If the observed data differ by an amount greater than a previously
    established threshold, the measurement is sent to the Central Sensor Node of the
    group, and this node will store the data and compare them to check if they exceed
    the alarm threshold. It also checks if the alarm has been detected by more than
    one of the sensors of the group in order to provide fault tolerance capabilities.
    In case of exceeding the alarm threshold, the data are forwarded to the Central
    Sensor Node of Urban Area 0. Then, it is forwarded to the central storage system
    in the data center. In case of not exceeding the alarm threshold, the data are
    stored in the Central Sensor Node of the group until all the data are sent every
    24 h period. Every day, the Central Sensor Node of Urban Area 0 will send all
    data to the Storage Server through the wired network. The next phase is responsible
    for making the decisions to correct anomalies. It is the Data Processing phase.
    In this phase, the data are sent from the Storage Server to the AI system. This
    system will be responsible for making the pertinent decisions that will be sent
    to the actuators. Finally, during the Action phase, the operation that the AI
    system considers adequate to solve the problem detected by the sensors will be
    sent to the Actuator Nodes. 2.5. Simulation Description In this section, the considerations
    under which the simulation was conducted are detailed. 2.5.1. Water Details For
    the simulation, we have considered a region that entails two urban areas (UAs)
    with their channel to collect the water, the main channel, and one irrigation
    channel (IC) with the small pools (POs) in which water is treated. A total of
    6 locations are considered in this simulation: 2 urban areas (UA1 and UA 2), the
    irrigation channel (IC 1), and the 3 pools (PO 1, PO 2, and PO 3.). In each one
    of these areas, a total of three nodes (a cluster) is located. The cluster comprises
    three nodes with LoRa interfaces. The six locations are close enough to ensure
    good coverage with a single LoRa gateway. Since we are going to simulate our results
    using the algorithms described above, we need to generate different values of
    pollution in the monitored areas. To generate these values, we have included in
    our simulations the movement of water from point to point and some pollution inputs
    generated by random numbers at different intervals. The generated pollution coming
    from UAs and the pollution from the IC is diluted into the channel and flows to
    the next station. The pollution levels are maintained along with the IC. They
    only decrease in the pools where biosorption material is cleaning the water. Each
    pool has the capacity to reduce 50% of the pollution present in the water. The
    following consideration is the probability of a false positive or a false negative
    due to an abnormal monitored value of one of the sensors. We have defined the
    chance of giving a false positive as 5% and 1% for a false negative. The simulation
    has a duration of one week in which each sensor measures the water quality once
    per minute. This timing is required since the arrival of pollution to the fields
    can transfer the problem of pollution from the water to the soil, and in this
    medium, the recovery is more complex. The simulation is carried out in two different
    periods of the year, in summer and in winter. This will affect only the energetic-related
    parameters. 2.5.2. Network Details Regarding the packets sent through the network,
    we consider that the sensed data have a length of 37 bits for each measurement.
    The headers of the packets sent through LoRa comprise a preamble of 8 bytes and
    a header of 13 bytes. The data packets that are forwarded over LoRa will have
    a minimum size of 141 bits, which corresponds to a message with one measurement.
    Furthermore, the maximum packet size is 4176 bits, which is the maximum size allowed
    by LoRa. Lastly, the LoRa acknowledgements (ACK) have a size of 21 bytes which
    corresponds to the preamble and the header. The simulation for the energy consumption
    of the LoRaWAN nodes is performed according to the energy consumption model presented
    in [17]. The total energy consumption of the node is presented in Equation (1).
    ETotal = EMicrocontroller + ESensors + Etx + Erx (1) where EMicrocontroller is
    the energy consumed by the microcontroller, ESensors is the energy consumed to
    activate the sensors and gather the data, Etx is the energy consumed to transmit
    the data, and Erx is the energy consumed to receive the ACK from the gateway,
    which according to [17] is 0.27 mJ. Equation (2) is utilized to determine the
    energy consumption per bit at the transmission. Ebit = (Power Consumption x ToA)/(8
    x (Preamble + Header + Payload)) (2) As for the LoRaWAN parameters, considering
    that our system requires a minimum range of 2 km, all possible settings would
    meet the requirement in the scenario of free space for a frequency of 868 MHz
    (See Figure 8). However, as there are vegetation and trees in the area, we consider
    a scenario with few obstacles, as presented in Figure 9. Therefore, for a transmission
    power of 7 dBm, the settings of BW250-SF7 and BW500-SF7 would not meet the requirement.
    For the case of 433 MHz, the required maximum theoretical distance is reached
    with all settings. Figure 8. Maximum theoretical distance at 868 MHz for free
    space. Figure 9. Maximum theoretical distance at 868 MHz for few obstacles. Considering
    the results of the theoretical distances for each LoRa setting, the settings selected
    for our system are the EU 863–870 frequency band, BW 125 kHz, and SF 8. Therefore,
    for the selected settings and a selected transmission power of 13 dBm with its
    power consumption of 92.4 mW/h, the energy consumed per bit for each sensor is
    45.55 μJ. 3. Results In this section, we present the results of our simulation.
    First of all, the storing and sending procedure of each node is represented as
    the SD status. Then, the bandwidth of the full network is depicted. Finally, the
    issues related to the remaining energy in the node are evaluated. 3.1. Status
    of the SDs Considering the protocol described in Figure 7, one of the main aspects
    of this protocol is storing data, instead of sending it, waiting until the moment
    in which the water quality changes to send all stored data. We have to consider
    that the nodes which are not a Cluster Head (CH) store the data before sending
    them to the CH once the node detects a change. This procedure implies that the
    CH node stores large amounts of data just before sending them. Figure 10 and Figure
    11 show the stored information in the SD of each one of the included nodes in
    our topology. While Figure 10 focuses on the first 60 min of the simulation, allowing
    for seeing some of the processes in detail, Figure 11 summarizes the whole simulated
    period. Figure 10. Stored information in the SDs cards of nodes. Details of the
    first 60 min of operation. Different letters (a) to (f) denote the different locations
    of the cluster: (a) UA1, (b) UA2, (c) IC1, (d) PO1, (e) PO2, and (f) PO 3. Figure
    11. Stored information in the SDs cards of nodes. Summary of the whole simulated
    period. Different letters (a) to (f) denote different locations of the cluster:
    (a) UA1, (b) UA2, (c) IC1, (d) PO1, (e) PO2, and (f) PO 3. In Figure 10, we can
    identify the stored information in the SDs of the clusters of six included locations:
    (a) UA1, (b) UA2, (c) IC1, (d) PO1, (e) PO2, and (f) PO 3. Focusing on Figure
    10a, we can identify that the three nodes store information until minute 35. In
    minute 35, Node 3 and Node 2 detect a change in water quality. Node 1 has a false
    negative. Node 3 sends data to Node 2 and erases the data. Then, Node 2 checks
    that both nodes registered a change and sends all the data stored in the SD to
    the gateway. We can identify that Node 3 continues storing information during
    the rest of the period. In UA2, in Figure 10b, we can see the same case in minute
    5, in this case, Node 3. Then, we identify a case in which the three sensors detect
    a water pollution change, see minute 52. In that case, the two nodes (Node 1 and
    Node 3) send the CH node data. Thus, the stored information is incremented three
    times. At that moment, the SD of the CH node stored 5550 bits of information.
    Similar cases can be seen in Figure 10c in minutes 41, 47, 51, and 59, and in
    Figure 10d in minutes 51 and 57. This delay of 10 min between IC1 and PO1 is the
    simulated time that the water remains in each pool. Finally, Figure 10e,f show
    the normal data storage process in the SDs. Since water is treated twice and three
    times, there are fewer water quality changes. On the other hand, Figure 11 shows
    the SD usage for each node along the simulated period of one week. We can identify
    that locations UA1, UA2, and IC1 have a similar trend. All these areas, in Figure
    11a–c, have low volumes of data stored in the SDs due to the constant exchange
    of information with the gateway caused by changes in water quality. Meanwhile,
    PO1, PO2, and PO3 are clusters characterized by larger amounts of data stored
    in the SDs, particularly during the second day of our simulation. In general terms,
    we can see that areas characterized by a lot of change follow the patterns seen
    in Figure 10. We can have false positives, false negatives, or true positives
    related to the water quality, which induce the sending event of stored data. In
    addition, we can see a secondary pattern here, mainly in the areas characterized
    by a lower degree of change. In these cases, when no changes are detected, Node
    1 and Node 3 send all the information to the CH at midday to free their SDs, and
    as a method of control, as explained in Figure 5. This behavior can be particularly
    identified in the node of PO3, in which the unique movements of data in the SDs
    are related to the process. Thus, we identify a pattern of storing information
    until midday when all the data are sent to Node 2, and then Node 2 sends data
    to the gateway to free its SD. The maximum amount of stored information is 106,486
    bits (13.3 Kbytes). 3.2. Consumed Energy Figure 12 and Figure 13 show the node
    energy. The nodes have an energy harvesting system that has been dimensioned to
    ensure that it can cover the node’s energy requirements. In comparison, Figure
    12 shows the remaining energy along with the simulation in each location in the
    worst scenario (winter with three consecutive days with a reduced energy harvesting).
    We can see the different locations in Figure 12a–f. In all four locations, we
    identify a similar trend. Node 2 is the node that consumes more energy since it
    receives the information of Nodes 1 and 3 and sends all the information to the
    gateway. Nodes 1 and 3 of each location have the same tendency in their energy
    levels in general terms. No significant differences can be seen among the energy
    levels of Nodes 1 and 3, along with the locations. Nonetheless, the energy of
    CHs differs from one location to another. Figure 12. Energy consumed by the nodes.
    Summary of the whole simulated period. Different letters (a) to (f) denote different
    locations of the cluster: (a) UA1, (b) UA2, (c) IC1, (d) PO1, (e) PO2, and (f)
    PO 3. Figure 13. Energy consumed by the nodes. Summary of the whole simulated
    period. Different letters (a–f) denote different ambient conditions: (a) winter
    period with reduced energy harvesting for three days, (b) winter period with full
    energy harvesting, (c) summer period. The CHs of locations with greater changes
    in water quality (Figure 12a–c) send more packets which are translated into more
    energy consumption. The CH with higher energy consumption is the CH of UA2 (Figure
    12b). This node reaches a minimum energy of 12,320 mW/h just before the sunrise
    of the fifth day. The rest of the CHs, located in areas with fewer or no changes
    in water quality (Figure 12d–f) have higher energy levels. Another interesting
    trend can be identified in PO3 (Figure 12f). We can see a sharp decrease in energy
    levels at midday due to the large amounts of data sent at that moment. The absence
    of water quality conditions causes this during the rest of the day. Since the
    other CHs send data when the nodes detect a change, this decrement of energy level
    is distributed throughout the day. Finally, Figure 13 shows the energy level of
    CHs in three different simulations for which we have modified the energy harvesting
    conditions. Figure 13a represents the worst conditions, the winter period with
    just 9 h of energy harvesting and three consecutive days with a reduction of 50%
    in the energy harvesting. These results summarize the data shown in Figure 12.
    Figure 13b shows a period of winter but without attenuated energy harvesting.
    We can identify that the CH of UA2 still has lower levels of energy than the others.
    Nevertheless, the difference is lower than in the previous scenario. On the other
    hand, Figure 13c shows a period of summer without attenuated energy harvesting.
    In this case, we have 14 h of energy production. We can see that the energy levels
    of CHs are similar to those in previous cases. During summer, nodes have their
    batteries full for most of the day. 3.3. Consumed Bandwidth Figure 14 portrays
    the entire network’s consumed bandwidth, including the communication inside each
    cluster and the communication between the CHs and the gateway. A detail of the
    consumed bandwidth of a short period can be seen in Figure 14a. It represents
    the first 720 min of the simulated network, the first half of the day. We can
    see that in a considerable amount of time, the network does not generate any packet
    exchange due to the application of the algorithm described in Figure 5. In this
    simulation, during the first 720 min, we can identify that in 612 min, there is
    no exchange of information in our network. Minute 661 is the moment when all the
    information is sent to the gateway. At this moment, we reach the maximum bandwidth
    usage, 177,187 bits/min (2.95 kbps). Figure 14. Details of consumed bandwidth
    in our simulation. Different letters denote different details: (a) initial period,
    (b) whole period, (c) summary of the maximum bandwidth of 40 simulations. Considering
    Figure 14b, we can identify the consumed bandwidth during the whole simulated
    period. We can find seven peaks in the consumed bandwidth, which correspond to
    the seven middays. The maximum peak in this period is found on the second day.
    At that moment, a consumed bandwidth of 381,357 bits/min (6.35 kbps) can be identified.
    It is important to note that among the 40 performed simulations, we have represented
    the one with the highest maximum bandwidth. Figure 14c shows the box and whiskers
    diagram of the maximum bandwidth of all the 40 simulations. The average maximum
    bandwidth is 306,411 bits/min (5.1 kbps). With the selected LoRa settings, the
    maximum data rate is 3125 bps [18]. Therefore, we conclude that the data of the
    third cluster should be forwarded in two periods to avoid peaks of bandwidth consumption
    above 3125 bps. A second simulation was performed to verify that changing the
    data forwarding settings of cluster three to two data forwarding times, being
    9 h and 21 h, allows the bandwidth to remain below the maximum 3125 bps. The consumed
    bandwidth in the second simulation is presented in Figure 15. Figure 15a shows
    the results for a short period of time. In this case, the first 1400 min are shown
    as the system spends more than 1100 min with low bandwidth consumption. Then,
    there is a peak of 155,011 bits/min (2.58 kbps). The results for the complete
    simulated period are shown in Figure 15b. The peak with the highest bandwidth
    consumption is the same as the one displayed in Figure 15a. The second highest
    bandwidth consumption peak reached 142,764 bits/min (2.37 kbps). Figure 15. Details
    of consumed bandwidth in second simulation. Different letters denote different
    details: (a) initial period, (b) whole period, (c) summary of the maximum bandwidth
    of 40 simulations. Another 40 simulations were performed to obtain the box and
    whiskers diagram of the maximum bandwidth for this simulation scenario (See Figure
    15c). The average maximum bandwidth was 128,204 bits/min (2.13 kbps). Furthermore,
    the change produced in the simulation does not have relevant repercussions on
    the global energy consumption of the proposed system. 4. Discussion In this section,
    a discussion is given on the previous related works on protocols designed to be
    applied to WSNs that are employed in agricultural monitoring systems or to reduce
    the consumed energy for their functioning. Furthermore, the positioning of the
    water quality sensors and previous works on this topic are discussed as well.
    WSNs have specific requirements and several protocols were developed specifically
    for these types of networks. Many systems for agricultural monitoring employ these
    protocols to forward the data obtained from the sensors. U. B. Nagesh et al. presented
    in [19] the usage of a message queuing telemetry transport (MQTT) protocol applied
    to precision farming and weather monitoring. The proposed system monitored humidity,
    temperature, and power and utilized a Raspberry Pi as the controller. The Eclipse
    Paho MQTT client was utilized to implement the subscriber and an open-source MQTT
    broker was utilized to access the data. A system for controlling and monitoring
    a smart greenhouse employing IoT and the MQTT protocol was presented by Dipen
    J. Vyas et al. in [20]. The system comprised an ESP8266 Wi-Fi module and an Atmega328
    board with temperature, humidity, and soil moisture sensors. For the MQTT broker,
    the authors utilized Mosquitto. Ravi Kisore Kodali et al. introduced in [21] a
    low-cost smart irrigation system that employed MQTT as the communication protocol.
    The system comprised the ESP8266 NodeMCU-12E, a soil moisture sensor, a temperature
    and humidity sensor, and a relay. Junsung Park et al. presented in [22] a greenhouse
    monitoring and control system. Communication among the nodes was performed over
    ZigBee employing the UDP-based CoAP communication protocol. Nodes sent the gathered
    information from the sensors to the gateway which converted the CoAP message into
    an HTTP one so as to forward the data to the server. Finally, A. Paventhan et
    al. performed in [23] a comparison of two different protocols for WSNs in agricultural
    environments. The authors compared a simple network management protocol (SNMP)
    and a constrained application protocol (CoAP) in its message format, security,
    and resource management, and the user interface. They concluded that the CoAP
    presented better integration with the web and was expected to grow in usage for
    WSN applications. Other protocols were created so as to address specific requirements
    of precision agriculture. Awais Ahmed et al. presented in [24] a routing protocol
    for WSNs to improve energy efficiency in environmental monitoring deployments.
    The energy-efficient sensor network routing (EESNR) protocol reduced the overhead
    of control messages. All the nodes were able to become the cluster head as long
    as the constraint on energy life and the established criteria was met. The authors
    performed simulations in NS3, comparing the proposed protocol to other existing
    protocols for WSNs like LEACH and its variations. The results showed an improvement
    of 27.8% of the lifespan of the sensors compared to the other protocols. A routing
    protocol for sensor networks intended for agriculture monitoring based on the
    efficient zone was developed by Lutful Karim et al. in [25]. An energy-efficient
    zone-based routing protocol (EEZRP) assigned different zones to the nodes depending
    on their distance to the base station and considering that nodes closest to the
    base station consume more energy. The proposed protocol considered the sensing
    range. The number of active nodes was fewer than in other protocols, but it might
    perform more processing and control operations. Simulations were performed to
    compare the energy consumption of the nodes to other protocols intended for WSNs
    like LEACH and DSC. The results showed a significant reduction of the consumed
    energy compared to other protocols. S. Bhagyashree et al. proposed, in [26], Apteen,
    a protocol intended for expanding the lifetime of the nodes in WSNs for precision
    agriculture. It is a cluster-based hierarchical routing protocol that groups the
    nodes into clusters comprising a cluster head and member nodes. The sensed parameters,
    thresholds, time division multiple access (TDMA) schedules, and the count time
    were broadcast from the cluster head. The messages were forwarded utilizing ZigBee
    in order to send the data to a database. Karim Fathallah et al. presented, in
    [27], partition aware RPL (PA-RPL), a routing protocol for IoT in precision agriculture.
    It was a version of the routing protocol for LLN (RPL) protocol that considered
    the partitions in farmlands to perform the routing topology. The protocol only
    considered one sink node. Simulations were performed employing the Cooja simulator.
    The results showed that the protocol was able to construct the network covering
    all the parcels. Lastly, a MAC protocol for precision agriculture based on storage
    and delivery intended for air–ground collaborative wireless networks (SD-MAC)
    was introduced by Song-Yue Liew et al. in [28]. In their proposal, an unmanned
    aerial vehicle (UAV) flew over the sensors in order to collect the gathered data.
    This way, a reduction in the duplication of data was obtained and the cost was
    reduced as a single UAV was able to gather the data from a large area. The proposed
    protocol forwarded the packets only when the UAV was within the range of the sensor.
    Sensors were deployed outside of the range of other sensors so as to avoid interferences.
    When the UAV was not close to the sensor, the sensor stored the information until
    the UAV was within range. Simulations were performed, comparing the proposed protocol
    to ALOHA. The results showed that the proposed protocol outperformed ALOHA. Regarding
    sensor networks for water quality monitoring and wastewater treatment, the contamination
    of the wastewater may not only affect the quality of the water but also the treatment
    plants or the sewer systems. Therefore, it is important to deploy a monitoring
    network to detect contamination and contain the affected areas. In their study,
    Mariacrocetta Sambito et al. [29] compared different sensor positioning techniques
    intended for nonconservative immanent pollutants. The results showed that the
    optimal solution could be reached with less computational effort by implementing
    pre-screening and gray information techniques. Stefania Piazza et al. utilized
    an optimization approach by using the NSGA-II algorithm to compare the positioning
    of the sensor probes to the results obtained from experimental tests [30]. The
    results showed that the sensors positioned at the center of the network minimize
    the redundancy and maximize the detection likelihood. Our work has presented a
    new algorithm and protocol for the detection and treatment of waters that other
    authors have not previously defined. We have utilized LoRaWAN, a low-power wide
    area network (LPWAN) protocol that supports low-cost, mobile, and secure bi-directional
    communication for the Internet of Things (IoT), which allowed a high level of
    energy saving and transmission over distances of several kilometers. Therefore,
    the proposed system allows its implementation in areas where it is difficult to
    get electric power to keep the devices active. Our devices, due to their low consumption,
    can be powered by batteries that are recharged through solar panels. 5. Conclusions
    Produce can be affected by the quality of the irrigation water and, therefore,
    affect the people that consume it. Therefore, monitoring water quality is important
    to ensure food safety. In this paper, we have proposed an architecture and communication
    protocol for an irrigation water quality monitoring system for precision agriculture.
    It is based on groups of sensor nodes that monitor the water quality of the main
    canal and of biosorption auxiliary canals to determine if the water needs to be
    treated. Simulations were performed to determine the amount of data stored on
    the SD card of the nodes, the consumed bandwidth, and the energy consumption of
    the system. The results show that the proposed system is able to transmit the
    necessary information and alerts with a low bandwidth generation. However, the
    scheduled data forwarding of the central node of the last auxiliary canal had
    to be modified to two transmissions instead of one to ensure the fair access policy
    of LoRa. Lastly, the system is able to sustain energy consumption even on winter
    days with fewer hours of light and adverse weather conditions. Therefore, when
    considering data transmissions for wireless networks using LoRa communications,
    the addition of data pre-processing techniques would be beneficial to reduce energy
    consumption and ensure that the fair access policy is not violated. For future
    work, the proposed protocol will be adapted to include the monitoring of the field
    area and tests will be performed on different vegetated environments. Furthermore,
    data pre-processing techniques will be implemented to improve the performance
    of the system. Author Contributions Conceptualization, J.M.J. and L.P.; methodology,

    Location: Pitesti, Romania SECTION I. Introduction In the context of climatic
    changes and population growth, the use of modern electronic technologies in the
    agricultural domain for improving the efficiency of this industry has become almost
    mandatory. Precision agriculture based on electronic automation modules and distributed
    sensor networks represents a very efficient solution for solving many problems
    regarding the farming resources optimization. In the broad spectrum of applications
    that are specific to the precision agriculture, the irrigation systems occupy
    a very special place because the water is a key resource that can significantly
    influence the efficiency of the farming systems. Although the irrigation systems
    were constantly improved over the years, only in the late period was realized
    a real progress in the implementation of the complex control systems for agriculture,
    by using powerful informatic systems, microcontrollers and new transmission technologies
    for the sensors. Precision irrigation technology allows the implementation of
    a new management methods for the water resources to meet the need of the soil
    and plants. In this context, this paper presents the structure of an enhanced
    automation module for testing the concept of precision irrigation. The design
    is based on an Arduino Uno development board and GSM/GPRS module for long distance
    data transmission [1], [2]. SECTION II. Precision Irrigation Systems Precision
    irrigation systems represents a technology applied in agricultural industry with
    the purpose to improve the utilization of the water and soil resources, without
    compromising the productions. A precision irrigation system must acquire and analyze
    data from a distributed network of sensors and, based on a predefined program
    and generate commands in a feedback loop for activating different types of control
    devices. The predefined program can contain elaborated algorithms that can operate
    in accordance with soil characteristics and with the local climatic conditions.
    Because usually the control algorithm of the precision irrigation system is implemented
    in software, it is obtained an enhanced flexibility and configurability. Also,
    a precision irrigation system can operate with multiple software models and algorithms
    that can be easily interchanged depending on the needs. This create conditions
    for a great reusability of the automation part of the system, including also the
    hardware elements [3]. In Fig. 1 is presented a typical structure of a precision
    irrigation system. As can be observed, the system is structured in multiple sections.
    The monitoring area is the first section of the system which comprise sensors
    for specific parameters (moisture, temperature etc.) and actuators for performing
    various commands like dripping activation, electro-valves control etc. The second
    section is represented by the local data acquisition and processing module that
    usually contains also wireless communication capability. Finally, the last section
    is composed by a gateway that connects all system to the Internet for additional
    data processing, adaptive control, decision support and cloud computing [4]. Fig.
    1. Typical structure of a precision irrigation system Show All Fig. 2. The block
    diagram of the automation module used for the implementation of the precision
    irrigation systems. Show All SECTION III. The Structure of the Automation Module
    The simplified block diagram of the proposed system is presented in Fig. 2. The
    proposed design contains a section of automation and control, realized with the
    microcontroller ATmega328P, a section containing the sensors and the execution
    elements, and a section responsible with the transmission of the acquired data.
    Dedicated sensors are used for measure the humidity in the soil and the water
    quantity that is provided to the sprinklers. As can be observed in Fig. 2, the
    system uses a water tank as buffer for alleviating the variable character of the
    supply sources that are existent in the site where the system is installed [5].
    The level of water in the tank is permanently monitored and the information is
    sent to the automation module through a conditioning circuity. A key parameter
    that is used by the automation module in the process of decision-making process
    is soil and air humidity. In this case, both parameters are constantly monitored
    and the acquired information is sent to the microcontroller through a set of conditioning
    circuits that are connected to its analog inputs (AIO-AI7). The water quantity
    that is sent to the irrigation system is accurately measured with a flowmeter
    based on turbine principle. The output signal of the flowmeter is a train of impulses
    with the frequency proportional with the volume of the water that passthrough
    the flowmeter. In order to accommodate the impulses from the flowmeter with the
    logical levels of the microcontroller, a dedicated circuit is used. The same circuit
    realizes also the galvanic insulation between the internal circuit of the flowmeter
    and the board containing microcontroller. Observing the Fig. 2 can be seen that
    the GSM/GPRS SIM800L communication module and the local display are connected
    with the ATmega328P microcontroller through the digital ports denoted C and D
    respectively. For ensuring the local connection between the automation module
    and a PC is used the internal USART block of the ATmega328P microcontroller and
    the circuit CH340G which operates as a bidirectional USART to USB to converter.
    The operation of the software application that was programmed into the memory
    of the ATmega328P microcontroller can be analyzed by looking to the simplified
    state diagram presented in Fig. 3. As can be observed this figure, the program
    starts with a general initialization of microcontroller''s internal variables
    and registers. In the next step are read the outputs of the sensors and a user
    menu displayed on the local LCD. Subsequently, this data will also be sent to
    a remote location via the GSM module. If the user wants to establish new threshold
    values for parameters of the automation module then the application enters in
    a specific loop that allows to realize this procedure [6], [7]. Fig. 3. The simplified
    state diagram of the software application for the automation module. Show All
    SECTION IV. Implementation and Results For verifying the correct operation of
    the proposed automation module, a small-scale precision irrigation system was
    implemented. The electrical diagram of the board containing the Atmega328P microcontroller,
    the local LCD and the interface circuits for sensors is detailed in Fig. 4. The
    air humidity was measured with H25k5A resistive sensor that is capable to operate
    in a range of 20-90% relative humidity, has a relatively small hysteresis of only
    3% at full-scale and can realize accurate determination in the temperature domain
    0-60°C. The moisture in the soil was measured with SEN-13637 sensor [8]. This
    device consists of two pads that operate as a variable resistor, depending on
    the conductivity of the soil, which in turn is proportional with the water content
    in the soil. The water volume transferred from the local tank to the irrigation
    system is monitored by the PRZ-1800/L flowmeter which has a precision of 2% and
    can operate with liquids having a maximum temperature of 65°C. The measurement
    resolution of the flowmeter is of 1880 impulses/liter [9]. The data transmission
    from the automation system to a remote PC is realized through the SIM800L quad-band
    GSM/GPRS module. The device is integrated in a dedicated extension board (shield)
    for the Arduino Uno development system contains the ATmega328P microcontroller.
    The wireless transmission is made at a relatively low speed of 85,6kbps, according
    to General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), but taking into account the extended availability
    of the mobile network, the automation module can be monitored virtually from everywhere.
    In Fig. 5 is presented the practical realization of the experimental prototype
    of the automation module and the reduced scale irrigation system. After tests
    realized with this reduced scale model it was found that the implemented system
    operates in accordance with the designated parameters. The flexibility in operation,
    scalability and the rapid reconfiguration offered by the proposed design is also
    due to the software application used to control the automation module. These characteristics
    represents major advantages of the proposed design. [10], [11]. Fig. 4. The electronic
    schematic of the main board of the automation module for precision irrigation
    systems. Show All Fig. 5. Small-scale experimental setup, containing the automation

    V. Conclusions Although it has always been an important issue, the management
    of water resources has now become, in the context of climate change, of vital
    importance for the development of a modern, much more efficient agriculture. Precision
    irrigation systems are a modern solution for optimizing the use of water in agriculture.
    Although the technology has many advantages, it is not widely adopted due to the
    initial development costs that are required for implementation and at the same
    time due to the requirements for the use of qualified personnel to operate the
    systems. This paper presented an enhanced design for implementing a reliable and
    efficient automation module for precision irrigation systems. Because is based
    on microcontroller and software programming, the proposed module is suitable for
    adaptive control and can be integrated in a larger system due to its communication
    capability using GSM network. Also, due to the implementation of the control algorithm
    in software, the proposed module has intrinsic flexibility in operation, scalability
    and allows rapid reconfiguration to suit any specific application. Tests realized
    with the reduced scale model of the automation module revealed that the implemented
    system operates in accordance with the designated parameters. ACKNOWLEDGMENT This

    City, Vietnam SECTION I. Introduction The automatic irrigation system for the
    agricultural greenhouse is a system that performs the functions of collecting
    environmental data in the greenhouse and uses them to irrigate the crops automatically
    ensuring maximum water and energy savings. The system is usually organized into
    three levels including field level, control level and supervisor level. In recent
    years, there were many studies in this field. For instant, the Intelligent Greenhouse
    Environment Monitoring System introduced in [1], in which research has developed
    wireless sensor nodes to measure the environmental parameters used in control
    of irrigation, ventilation and lighting in the greenhouse. The system is based
    on ZigBee and embedded technology. It has the limitation that the use of medium
    access control (MAC) method called Pure Aloha reduces the reliability of the system
    especially in the case of large number of nodes in the network. A study on applications
    of wireless sensor network (WSN) for irrigation systems [2] has also been conducted.
    In this study, the authors created a system consisting of a central device connected
    to environmental data collection stations via ZigBee standard and developed an
    automatic irrigation algorithm. However, more irrigation algorithms should be
    developed instead of only one based on soil moisture. Moreover, the remote monitoring
    and control mode is only referred to as a development direction that has not yet
    been implemented in this study. Systems designed to fit the IoT trend are also
    a new research direction. The integrated system between Web Server, Ethernet and
    ZigBee technology specified in [3] is one of them. Although this is an advanced
    system however it is only designed to perform monitoring functions without control
    functions. One common finding in all of these studies is the use of ZigBee communication.
    The advantages of ZigBee such as low power consumption, high stability have explained
    for this. However, the limitation on transmission range is the main disadvantage
    of ZigBee technology (about 100 m), which becomes a major barrier when we need
    to expand the area of greenhouses. From the analysis above, we have researched
    and designed an automatic irrigation system for greenhouse crops to overcome the
    shortcomings of the above studies with a new approach. In this study, we have
    used the LoRa technology with outstanding advantages in transmission range and
    energy saving. In addition, in order to increase the stability of the system,
    we also propose to apply Master/Slave medium access control method for LoRa network.
    The irrigation modes are also more diversified and can be easily installed via
    Local User Interface or Web Interface. SECTION II. LORA TECHNOLOGY LoRa is a wireless
    communication standard that utilizes the Chirp Spread Spectrum (CSS) modulation
    technology. This technique has been used for a variety of military applications
    such as radar systems. LoRa is the world’s first commercially available wireless
    technology with low cost, long transmission range and optimal power consumption.
    The Table I below compares some parameters including transfer rate, transmission
    range, power consumption and cost between some popular wireless technologies.
    Accordingly, LoRa has shown its superiority in many aspects. Its only weakness
    is the data rate. However, in wireless sensor network applications, this is not
    an issue. TABLE I THE COMPARISON OF SOME WIRELESS TECNOLOGY [4] A. Characteristic
    Parameters of LoRa In LoRa technology, there are three main types of parameters
    to consider: Spreading Factor (SF): A tradeoff between data rate and range is
    provided by SF. Choice of higher spreading factor can increase the range but decreases
    the data rate and vice versa. Each symbol is spread by a spreading code of length
    2SF chips Coding Rate (CR): Define the number of bits added in the payload of
    the LoRa Packet that the receiver can use to detect and often to correct errors
    in the message, but it also decreases the effective data rate. Bandwidth (BW):
    LoRa provides three scaleable BW settings of 125 kHz, 250 kHz and 500 kHz. Transmitter
    sends the spread data at a chip rate equal to the system bandwidth in chips per-second-per-Hertz.
    So a LoRa bandwidth of 125 kHz corresponds to a chip rate of 125 kcps. SF, BW
    and CR are the basic and important parameters of the LoRa chipset. In that, SF
    and BW will affect the data rate and range while CR only affect the data rate.
    Depending on the specific application requirements for range, data rate we can
    choose the reasonable values to optimize the transmission. B. LoRa Packet Structure
    Fig. 1. LoRa Packet Structure Show All LoRa offers maximum packet size of 256
    bytes. The LoRa Packet (Fig. 1) is composed as follows: Preamble field: is transmitted
    first for the synchronization purposes of receiver with the incoming data flow.
    Header field: Depends on the selection of one of the two supported modes. In default
    Explicit Mode, the number of bytes in the header field specifies Forward Error
    Correction (FEC) code rate, payload length and presence of CRC in the frame. The
    second Implicit Mode specifies that coding rate and payload in a frame are fixed.
    In this mode, frame does not contains this field, which gives reduction in transmission
    time. Header field also contains 2 bytes CRC field which allows the receiver to
    discard packets with invalid header. Header field along with its CRC field are
    4 bytes long. Payload field: Contains application data transmitted through LoRa.
    Length of payload field varies from 2 to 255 bytes. CRC: Comprises 2 bytes of
    cyclic redundancy check (CRC) for error detection of payload field. This field
    is optional. C. Time on the Air of data packet For LoRa, the actual time on the
    air for a packet can be defined as [5]: T packet = T preamble + T payload (1)
    View Source In this formula, Tpreamble is transmission time of preamble field
    and Tpayload is transmission time of payload field. Tpreamble can be defined as:
    T preamble =( n preamble +4.25)× T sym (2) View Source Where npreamble is preamble
    length and Tsym defines the time required to transmit a symbol: T sym = 2 SF /BW
    (3) View Source with SF as Spreading Factor, BW as Bandwidth The payload transmission
    time is: T payload = n payload × T sym (4) View Source npayload is calculated
    as: { X=ceil[ (8PL−4SF+28+16CRC−20IH) 4(SF−2DE) ] n payload =8+max(X×(CR+4),0)
    View Source In the formula above: PL: number of bytes in payload field. IH: 0
    when the implicit header mode is used and 1 for vice versa. DE: 1 for enabled
    low data rate optimization and 0 for opposite case. CR: code rate (1 corresponds
    to CR = 4/5, 4 corresponds to CR = 4/8). So total time on the air Tpacket can
    be defined by using Equations 1, 2 and 4 T packet =( n preamble + n payload +4.25)×
    T sym (5) View Source SECTION III. LORA NETWORK CONSTRUCTION Fig. 2. Model of
    LoRa network referenced with OSI model Show All Fig. 3. Master/Slave network model
    Show All The LoRa network in this system was designed with star topology. Each
    of the devices in the network is structured in three layers according to the OSI
    model. Where the highest layer is the application layer. Under it, is the MAC
    layer (using master/slave medium access control method). The lowest layer is the
    physical layer (using LoRa modulation) Fig. 2. With this Master/Slave medium access
    control method, the Master station is responsible for allocating access to slaves
    (Fig. 3). Slaves are passive, so they only access the line and exchange the data
    when requested by Master. The Master Station either chose directly a slave to
    communicate with or uses polling method according to the purpose of access. The
    sequence diagram in Fig. 4 illustrates how polling method is implemented by Master.
    Fig. 4. Sequence diagram of master polling Show All The Master/Slave has the advantage
    of being simple and cost-effective because the Master Station is the only one
    that managing all network connections. With a well-designed Master Station, the
    reliability of the network will be guaranteed. The major disadvantage of this
    method is that the exchange of information between the Slave Stations (if any)
    is limited because the data must pass through the intermediate station also known
    as Master. However, in this design, field-level devices (Slaves) do not need to
    exchange information with each other, so the defect does not appear. SECTION IV.
    SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE The system architecture is designed as shown in Fig. 5. It
    includes a Concentrator, End Nodes, Local Database & User Interface and Web Server.
    Concentrator: Coordinates the operation of the network, receives data of environmental
    parameters from the Sensor Nodes and forwards this data to the Supervisor Computer
    and Web Server via Wi-Fi or GPRS/3G service. In addition, this device also functions
    to control the irrigation process according to the mode that the user has installed
    from the Computer Interface or Web Interface. In automatic irrigation mode, the
    data sent from Sensor Nodes is used as feedback to control the irrigation process.
    The Concentrator does not directly control the state of the valves, which is done
    through the Control Nodes located at field level. End Nodes: Includes Sensor Nodes
    and Control Nodes. In particular, the Sensor Nodes performs the measurement of
    air temperature, humidity and soil moisture, while the Control Nodes directly
    controls the actuators such as pumps and valves ordered by the Concentrator. Local
    Database & User Interface : This is where all data of the system is stored. User
    are also provided the option of monitoring, installing and managing system. Web
    Server & Web Interface: Is an online Server for storing data from measurement
    points. It not only provides tools for remote monitoring and control but also
    data analysis based on user requirements. Fig. 5. System Architecture Show All
    SECTION V. DESIGN A. Design of Concentrator Fig. 6. Concentrator block diagram
    Show All Fig. 7. Main program flowchart for Concentrator Show All As represented
    in Fig. 6. The main processing unit in the Concentrator is a 32-bit microcontroller
    (STM32F103RCT6) for powerful processing with clock speeds up to 72 MHz. The Concentrator
    is equipped with three types of wireless communication. While LoRa communication
    enables the Concentrator to connect to field-level devices, WiFi (ESP8266) and
    GPRS (SIM 800L) provide internet service for connecting the system to the Web
    Server. These blocks are handled by the central processing unit through UART standard.
    In order to increase the processing capacity and reduce the load on the central
    processing unit, the LoRa communication block is equipped with a particular microprocessor
    connected to the LoRa SX1278 modem via the SPI standard. Nearly every communication
    task in the LoRa network is processed by this microcontroller. Communication between
    the Concentrator and the Supervisor computer in case of configuration is performed
    by serial communication block (CH34G). The flowchart Fig. 7 describes the design
    of software for Concentrator. B. Design of Sensor Node Fig. 8. Sensor Node and
    Control Node block diagram Show All Fig. 9. Main program flowchart for Sensor
    Node Show All There are eight main blocks in the design of Sensor Node (Fig. 8a).
    The central processing unit in Sensor Node handles LoRa communications task and
    communicates with sensors as well as processes the data given by sensor, so the
    STM32F103 microcontroller is selected to meet the requirement of processing capacity.
    The LoRa modem (SX1278) is connected to the central processing unit via SPI. The
    temperature-humidity sensor (DHT11) is operated by the central processing unit
    via one-wire standard measuring from 0 to 50°C (±2 °C) for temperature and 20-90
    %RH (±5 %RH) for air humidity. The parameter of soil moisture is also given by
    a smart sensor that is linked to the central processing unit through 2-wire synchronization
    standard. Besides, the connection between Sensor Node and Computer for address
    configuration is provided by the serial communication block (CH340G). The configuration
    parameters for the device will be stored in the EPROM. Finally, the LEDs show
    the operating status of the device while the button is used to select either setting
    mode or running mode for the Sensor Node. The software’s algorithm for Sensor
    Nodes is pointed out in flowchart Fig. 9. C. Design of Control Node In the block
    diagram of Control Node Fig. 8b, the Control Node also includes a central processing
    unit (STM32F103), Lora communication block (SX1278), EPROM memory with the same
    function as the Sensor Node. Control the actuators such as valves and pumps is
    the main function of the Control Node performed directly by the Relay block. As
    an important part of Control Node, Feedback block provide information about the
    actual operating state of the actuators so that it allows for quick detection
    of unexpected problems. The software of Control Node device is designed as flowchart
    shown in Fig. 10. Fig. 10. Main program flowchart for Control Node Node Show All
    D. Design of Local DataBase & User Interface The Local User Interface (Fig. 11)
    is designed with main functions corresponding to 5 interfaces: Data monitoring
    interface: Display data and status of pumps and valves in the system. Control
    Interface: Allows setting of irrigation mode for each area. There are three modes
    of irrigation: Schedule mode, Automatic mode and Handle mode. Setting interface:
    Allows to add, remove farming area, set up the connection, enable the monitoring
    mode via Internet and chose the data sampling cycle. In addition, the interface
    provides advanced settings related to LoRa’s parameters such as address, frequency,
    spreading factor, coding rate, bandwidth to devices in the network. Reporting
    interface: Allows us to access the data and displays in the form of line chart
    and table. Data can also be extracted as Excel file. Crop management interface:
    Provide crop management functions, inquire crop information and propose appropriate
    crop. E. Web Server Intergration Currently, we have built-in Web Server (Fig.
    12) based on Ubiodot’s platform providing remote monitoring, control and data
    storage. Depending on the Internet connection technology selected is GPRS or WiFi
    we respectively use the HTTP method Get/Post or use the TCP/IP protocol to send
    and request data interactively to the Web Server. Fig. 11. Computer Interfaces
    Show All Fig. 12. Web interface based on Ubidots Platform Show All SECTION VI.
    TEST AND RESULT Fig. 13. The whole system Show All We have successfully designed
    a test system (Fig. 13) including 1 Concentrator, 2 Sensor Nodes, 2 Control Nodes,
    1 Local Database & User Interface and 1 Web Server (Ubidots). The tests were conducted
    on the campus of Hanoi University of Science and Technology. Accordingly, the
    End Devices are located about 350 meters from the Cordinator. The Control Nodes
    were connected to the pump (12VDC) and the valves to control the irrigation process
    for the areas where the soil moisture sensors of the Sensor Nodes are located.
    The experiments indicate that the system operate stably and meet the functions
    as designed. The irrigation modes also works correctly. The Fig. 14 and Fig. 15
    demonstrates the experimental process of automatic and scheduled irrigation during
    24 hours. Fig. 14. Automatic Irrigation Show All Fig. 15. Scheduled Irrigation
    Show All Fig. 16. The average transmission time of each message Show All Fig.
    17. Message rates must be re-transmitted at least one time Show All In order to
    evaluate the stability of the system using the Master/Slave medium access control
    method compared to the Pure Aloha method, we created the continuous transmission
    of 100 messages (16 bytes per messages) from End Devices to the Concentrator then
    assessed the rate of re-transmitted message and the average transmission time
    of each message. This test was individually conducted in 4 cases with 1, 2, 3
    and 4 End Devices connected in the network. Fig. 16 and Fig. 17 indicate that
    the higher of End Device, the higher average time needed to transmit a message,
    but the rate of re-transmitted message is always low and almost unchanged in case
    of Master/Slave method is used. For the Pure Aloha method, when the number of
    End Devices increases, the rate of re-transmitted messages rises dramatically
    causing the increase in average transmission time of each message. According to
    that trend, if the number of End Devices continues to increase the system may
    fail. In summary, it is clear that Master/Slave medium access control is more
    stable and reliable than Pure Aloha. SECTION VII. CONCLUSION The paper have presented
    the design of an automatic monitoring and control system for greenhouse agriculture
    including the overall structure of the system and the design in detail of each
    component including hardware and software design. In this study we used LoRa technology
    combined with the Master/Slave medium access control method to resolve the remaining
    issues of some previous studies such as range and reliability of wireless network,
    system functionality and irrigation modes are also made more diversified. Furthermore,
    the ability to control and monitor the system remotely via a Web Interface has
    also been integrated. Lastly, we have also provided some experimental results
    to support our study. With the results achieved, the system will be further studied
    to improve the stability and reliability of the system so that it can be put into
    practice in the near future. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics

  description: Precision agricultural techniques are widely developed to monitor and
    control growth of plant in greenhouse. The use of greenhouses is suitable for
    the countries that have unpredictable weather e.g. Indonesia. The main monitors
    and controls in greenhouse are sensor networks and actuators. Some examples of
    the precision agriculture technique are monitoring of fertilizer needs and smart
    irrigation. This paper presents a develpment of precision agriculture based on
    Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) with Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT protocol.
    The WSN system involves Internet of Things (IoT) technology to connect devices,
    collect and distribute information. IoT integration with cloud computing is aimed
    to overcome limitations of the IoT devices in remote monitoring and control. WSN
    development uses MQTT protocols that have advantages that are lightweight, simple,
    can run on a small bandwidth and more advanced compared to Hypertext Transfer
    Protocol (HTTP ). In this paper the SHT3x and TSL2561 sensors are used to observe
    temperature, humidity and light intensity of the greenhouse. Test results of three
    sensors in data transmission speeds indicate that the MQTT protocol run with very
    small bandwidth. It can transmit data on the 4G network of AXIS provider with
    download capability of 0.02 kbps and upload 1.65 kbps. The average data transmission
    speed is approximately 1 second.

    Natal, Brazil SECTION I. Introduction Several studies on the development of new
    technologies for agriculture application have been carried out recently. It is
    already known that agriculture is the sector that influences in a very significant
    way the development of Brazil, but it?s also the sector that consumes the most
    water in the country. Technologies such as wireless sensors have gained great
    space in this sector, as a tool that enable efficiency and sustainability advances
    in the agricultural processes. Agriculture is the most water consuming socioeconomic
    activity in the world, totaling an average of 70% of all water consumed in the
    planet. In Brazil, this situation rises to 75% and, in some underdeveloped countries,
    exceeds 80%. At the same time, it is the most water- wasting activity, according
    to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). The results
    obtained in this project can be used as a tool for automatic irrigation control
    applications, or any other necessary measurement that is interesting to specialists
    in the agronomy area. This work aims to present the characteristics of the use
    of water resources in agriculture, the main technologies for soil moisture measurements
    and the development of a simple, functional, flexible and low-cost prototype of
    a wireless sensor network (WSN) using ZigBee communication protocol, and wireless
    communication modules Xbee. A. Water consumption in Brazilian agriculture Irrigation
    is the largest user of water in Brazil, with an irrigable area of approximately
    29.6 million hectares. \"Although irrigated agriculture is the main use in the
    country and, therefore, requires more attention from the management bodies, aiming
    at the rational use of water, it results in an increase in the supply of food
    and lower prices in relation to those produced in non-irrigated areas to a substantial
    increase in productivity?, says the Water Resources Scenario in Brazil [1]. According
    to the National Water Agency of Brazil (ANA), the total consumed flow of water
    in 2016 is presented in the Fig. 1. Fig. 1 Consumption consumed in Brazil (m3/s)
    Show All Investments in irrigation result in a substantial increase in productivity
    and in the value of agricultural production, reducing the need for expansion in
    areas occupied by other uses and coverages (e.g. native grasslands or forests).
    Applying good soil and water management practices, irrigators achieve efficiencies
    of water use above 90% [2], B. The use of technology in agriculture Precision
    Agriculture consists of a set of techniques and methodologies that aim to optimize
    the management of crops and the use of agricultural inputs, providing maximum
    economic efficiency. Precision Agriculture tools allow the rational use of correctives,
    fertilizers, and agrochemicals, increasing the reduction of environmental impacts
    resulted from agricultural activity. Precision agriculture is also defined as
    an agricultural management system based on the spatial variation of soil and plant
    properties found in crops and aims at optimizing profitability, sustainability,
    and environmental protection. It is a set of technologies applied to allow a management
    system that considers the spatial variability production [3]. Currently, in agricultural
    terms, what we see is a potential growth in the use of new technologies as support
    for decisionmaking. Precision farming has been demonstrating that it is possible
    to produce more with fewer resources, with irrigation being a good example of
    this. The use of sensors, applied to irrigation systems, is strategic. One advantage
    is the preservation of an increasingly scarce natural resource, maximizing irrigation
    efficiency, where only areas with water deficiency are irrigated, avoiding waste
    of water and reducing the cost of energy consumption. Thus, the use of WSN has
    a great value for precision agriculture and for agricultural irrigation systems
    [4], SECTION II. Wireless Sensor Network A WSN is made up of a large number of
    devices called sensor nodes. These devices can be distributed in a wide range
    of areas, including in areas where human intervention for administration and repair
    is impractical, such as in a swamp, a closed forest or even in a hostile territory
    due to the occurrence of a war. The basic function of a WSN is to collect data
    in an environment, to perform some processing on them depending on the policy
    implemented in that network, and then to send these data to an Access Point (AP)
    in order to an external remotely observer monitor this area of interest. There
    are several possible configurations in a WSN, each designed takes into consideration
    the crucial parameters to the observer. This makes a proposed solution good for
    a specific application and impracticable for another, which characterizes WSNs
    as application dependent. Figure 2 shows an area of interest with two WSN configurations,
    one with flat (b) organization and another with hierarchical (a) organization
    [5]. Fig. 2 Types of WSN Show All Flat WSNs are characterized by devices with
    the same priority, with any of them accessing the AP, (if they have transmission
    range for this). Hierarchical WNS is characterized by devices with different priorities,
    and it is not possible for any device in this network to send data to the access
    point. In the hierarchical network, some devices are elected \"leaders\" of an
    area. Thus, if a device in a particular area needs to send data to the AP, it
    must forward the data to its group leader, and this group leader will transmit
    it to the AP. Table I presents some others important characteristics of a WSN
    [5]. TABLE I Characteristics Of Wsn A. Characteristics of a Sensor Node The WSN
    is dynamic, it can consist of several types of sensor nodes. The environment is
    heterogeneous in terms of both hardware and software. The construction of the
    sensor node has as main objective to reduce costs, increase flexibility, provide
    fault tolerance, improve the development process and save energy [6]. The sensor
    nodes are made up of hardware that allows devices to be a small computational
    unit, composed by microcontroller, power source (battery), data transmission unit
    and sensors, which can be of soil temperature and humidity, barometric pressure,
    among others. Figure 3 shows the basic block diagram of a sensor node [5], Fig.
    3 Block diagram of a Sensor Node Show All B. Use of WSN in agriculture Reference
    [7] mentions that the application of WSN in agriculture can allow a continuous
    data acquisition in the field and provide this data to the user for decision making.
    The type of data to be collected, the sensors to be used, the way of using it
    and the results may be varied according to the application in agriculture. The
    data collected by the sensors should be available for analysis at a central station.
    These data will be used at specific moments of decision making. The concentration
    of data may occur at specific times, associated with agricultural operations already
    performed. It is important that sensor data collection does not represent an extra
    handling operation, so as not to increase production costs. Finally, the installation
    of the network should be simple, since most rural workers have little or no knowledge
    of computers and electronics systems. Settings should be avoided and, when present,
    should be as simple as possible. For applications in precision agriculture, it
    is important that the data collected have spatial matching. Therefore, there must
    be some correlation between the data coming from a sensor and a location. One
    possible way is to predetermine the position of each node. C. IEEE 802.15.4 Protocol
    The IEEE 802.15.4 standard specifies the physical (PHY) and Medium Access Control
    (MAC) layers for local and personal wireless LR-WPAN (Low-Rate Wireless Personal
    Area Networks). This standard follows the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model
    of layered abstraction. In the 802.15.4 standard, only the PHY and MAC layers
    are implemented. An LR-WPAN is a simple and low-cost communications network that
    enables wireless connectivity in applications with limited power and low processing
    requirements. The main objectives of an LR-WPAN are ease of installation, reliable
    data transfer, short range operation, low cost and reasonable battery life, keeping
    a simple and flexible protocol. The IEEE 802.15.4 protocol defines some characteristics
    related to the LR-WPAN [8]: Data rate of 250 Kbps, 100 Kbps, 40 Kbps and 20 Kbps;
    Star or point-to-point operation; 16-bit or 64-bit addressing; Guaranteed Time
    Slots (GTSs) option; Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA
    / CA) multiple access with collision avoidance/carrier prevention; Fully recognized
    protocol for transfer reliability; Low energy consumption; Spectrum Energy Detection
    (ED - Energy Detection); Link Quality Indication (LQI - Link Quality Indication).
    Table II shows some radios modules that use IEEE 802.15.4 protocol and can be
    used for WSN projects [10]. TABLE II Radios With Ieee 802.15.4 Protocol D. ZigBee
    Protocol ZigBee® is a global standard, created and maintained by the ZigBee Alliance?
    that specifies how devices on an LR- WPAN wireless network, based on the IEEE
    802.15.4 standard must communicate securely and reliably. It is aimed at the development
    of sensing and control applications in industrial, medical and residential automation.
    There are three types of ZigBee devices (Coordinator, Router, and End Device)
    and there are three different topologies provided by ZigBee networks (Star, Cluster
    Tree, and Mesh). A ZigBee network (PAN) consists of a coordinator and one or more
    routers and end devices. The network is created when a coordinator selects a channel
    and an available network address. Once the coordinator initializes the PAN network,
    it is possible that routers and end devices join this network. When a router or
    end device joins a PAN network, they receive a 16-bit network address enabling
    the transmission or receipt of other devices from the same network address. Routers
    and coordinators can allow other devices to join the PAN network and can assist
    in sending data over the network to ensure that data is correctly sent to the
    recipient. When a router or coordinator allows an end device to join the PAN network,
    the end device becomes a “child” of the router or coordinator that allowed it
    to join. End devices, however, can transmit or receive data, but cannot route
    data from one node to another, nor can they allow devices to join the PAN network.
    End devices should always communicate directly with the “parent” they have joined.
    The “parent” router or coordinator can route data on behalf of a “child” of the
    final device to ensure that it reaches the correct destination. End devices are
    intended to be battery powered and can support low power modes [9]. Figure 4 shows
    an example of a ZigBee network. Fig. 4 Example of ZigBee Network Show All SECTION
    III. XBee Modules XBee is a brand of Digi International that names a family of
    radio frequency modules, compatible with the form factor. Initially, XBee radios
    were introduced to the market through the company MaxStream in 2005. Based on
    the IEEE 802.15.4-2003 standard and designed for communication in point-to-point
    and star topologies with transmission rates of 250 kbps over the air. This project
    focuses on the use of the XBee Series 2 (XB24-z7WIT-004) model. The XBee Series
    2 modules are designed to operate within the ZigBee protocol and support the unique
    needs of low-cost, low-power wireless sensor networks. Modules require minimal
    power and provide reliable data delivery between remote devices. The modules operate
    within the 2.4 GHz ISM frequency band [9]. Table III shows XBee Series 2 specifications.
    This hardware is compatible with other XBee models. TABLE III XBee S2 Spedncations
    The XBee Series 2 OEM RF Modules interface to a host device through a logic-level
    asynchronous serial port. Through its serial port, the module can communicate
    with any logic and voltage compatible UART; or through a level translator to any
    serial device (For example: through a Max Stream proprietary RS-232 or USB interface
    board) [9]. The Fig. 5 shows the XBee S2 module used in this project. Fig. 5 XBee
    S2 used in this project Show All In addition to the XBee modules, this project
    also used different hardware such as microcontrollers (Arduino Platform), humidity
    and temperature sensors, RTC (Real Time Clock), displays, external memory to save
    all the data and others. SECTION IV. Development Of A Prototype In order to perform
    communication tests using ZigBee protocol and sensor acquisitions data, a prototype
    (Fig. 6) of a WSN for agriculture application was developed as part of this project
    using the previously described components. The analysis of the data collected
    from the sensors was not performed since it is necessary to have agronomic engineering
    knowledge to correctly analyze this data, only the analysis of the network operation
    using the ZigBee protocol including the behavior analysis of the system in some
    application conditions. Fig. 6 WSN Prototype Show All The prototype is consisted
    by: Central (Coordinator): Responsible for creating and managing the network,
    receive and store all the data received by the Sensor Nodes and provide all the
    information in a Serial Port ( Fig. 6 ). Sensor Node: It has the main function
    read all the sensors that are connected to the module and send the data to the
    central (coordinator). It is a flexible module that can be installed in several
    locations without the need for wires or power cables because it has an autonomous
    power system with photovoltaic and rechargeable battery. Figure 8 shows the two
    Sensor Nodes used in this project. Actuator Node: This node ( Fig. 9 ) has the
    responsibility to control the irrigation according to the commands received from
    the coordinator. This node is using only 2 of 14 digital outputs available to
    control two water valves. Fig. 7 Coordinator Node Show All Fig. 8 Sensor Nodes
    Show All Fig. 9 Actuator Node Show All SECTION V. Testing and Results To perform
    tests with the developed prototype, the system was applied in different environments.
    All data collected were stored on the SD card and plotted in Excel, but no data
    analysis was performed, only the operating characteristics of the ZigBee network
    with the XBee transmission modules and the microcontrollers. The Fig. 10 shows
    all the devices connected to the same network through the software XCTU. Fig.
    10 Testing all nodes in the same network Show All A. Testing with sensors A lot
    of tests were performed in a residence using simple plant pots of different types.
    The system ran for about 4 weeks and all data collected was stored on the SD card.
    Each sensor node sends a string that contains the value of all the sensors. So,
    the central (coordinator) receives the message in a standard which contains the
    address of ?who? sent the information, the date, time and sensor values like in
    the Fig. 11. Fig. 11 String sent by the sensor node to the central Show All The
    graph showed in Fig. 12 shows the soil moisture data from Sensor 1 acquired on
    March 22nd and 23rd, 2017. The indications in red show the sensor response when
    irrigation was triggered, represented by a decrease in sensor output voltage.
    The Sensor Node was configured to collect data every 30 minutes and this time
    can be increased since the soil properties change slowly. This reduces the power
    consumption and provides a better battery performance for the Sensor Node. Fig.
    12 Soil moisture response Show All The data obtained from Sensor 1 of the soil
    temperature is presented in Fig 13. In this case, data were plotted on April 1st,
    2nd, and 3rd of 2017 and the sampling time was 15 minutes. It was possible to
    observe a good accuracy of the temperature sensor (model DS18B20) and the responses
    were very similar in the three days. The transmission modules presented almost
    the same amount of data during the 3 days, the difference was around 2 to 4 samples
    per day one day. This occurred due to the time base used in the microcontrollers,
    which are not so accurate. This difference did not significantly interfere with
    the analysis of the data since the soil properties vary slowly. Fig. 13 Soil temperature
    response Show All In general, the two nodes Sensors presented good answers regarding
    the data transmissions, that is, there was little data loss. Since the sampling
    time was 15 minutes, considering a total of 24 hours (1440 minutes), 96 samples
    of each sensor node should be transmitted. One of the sensor nodes presented 5
    samples less in one day, resulting in an efficiency of 94.79% during testing on
    this day (worst case). Another test was performed in order to verify the functionality
    of a router in a network. Without the router, the maximum distance between the
    Sensor Node and the Coordinator was 55 meter and after including a router, this
    distance increased to 70 meters. SECTION VI. Conclusion The studies carried out
    on water consumption in agriculture present results that indicate a great importance
    of the development and application of new technologies for saving water resources
    and that the use of wireless sensor networks is interesting and feasible for this
    development. The practical tests applied in this work using the concepts of transmission
    networks, topologies, architectures and software of communication tests, presented
    the main characteristics of the ZigBee protocol together with the Xbee S2 wireless
    transmission modules, having in most of the presented procedures, success in the
    tests. This work can also be used as a reference for other applications involving
    wireless sensor networks, such as residential, building or industrial automation,
    long distance monitoring systems such as forest fire detectors, commercial applications,
    among others applications. Finally, after the developed system is already in operation
    and applied in small plantations, this project will be continued for the development
    of a commercial product, opening new lines of work and research in the areas of
    electronic engineering, software engineering, instrumentation, and agronomy. Authors

  description: The quality of grapes and the drying process has a momentous impact
    on the quality of the final products (raisins). South Azerbaijan is the most important
    region for grape growing and raisin producing. However, the majority of the vineyards
    in the region are traditional, and the drying process is carried out in conventional
    structures that are not convenient. To increase the quality and productivity,
    it is necessary to modernize agricultural practices with reasonable cost suitable
    and affordable to traditional farming and farmers. To do this, the harsh environments
    and severe climate conditions of the vineyards and the drying buildings should
    be observed periodically to collect data. Wireless Sensor Networks are a key technology
    that can provide precise information, can update information, and can be a valuable
    resource to farmers to determine appropriate management practices. Using this
    technology, farmers can make real-time decisions such as scheduling irrigation
    periods, preventing diseases, choosing the right time for harvesting and so on.
    In this project, a Wireless Sensor Network system was designed and developed for
    remote real-time monitoring and collection of micrometeorological parameter data
    in three distant vineyards. The system was also used for monitoring the SO2 gas
    fumigation process and atmospheric parameters inside the drying structure. The
    system consists of a gateway and a series of peripheral wireless motes placed
    in the vineyards and inside the drying structure, which are equipped with agrometeorological
    sensors for environmental monitoring and for storing and transmitting data to
    the gateway. The gateway collects agrometeorological data and utilizes a wireless
    technology for data transmission and for communication between the motes and the
    central server (webpage). In addition, an on-line (real-time) warning system was
    embedded in the gateway to send alarm signals via SMS (Short Message Service).
    The devices were tested for software configuration functionality, hardware operation
    and data acquisition, energy consumption, and connectivity. Field experiment results
    demonstrated that the system represents a complete monitoring system, which provides
    efficient performance for developing information systems in precision viticulture.

    quality of grapes and the drying process has a momentous impact on the quality
    of the final products (raisins). South Azerbaijan is the most important region
    for grape growing and raisin producing. However, the majority of the vineyards
    in the region are traditional, and the drying process is carried out in conventional
    structures that are not convenient. To increase the quality and productivity,
    it is necessary to modernize agricultural practices with reasonable cost suitable
    and affordable to traditional farming and farmers. To do this, the harsh environments
    and severe climate conditions of the vineyards and the drying buildings should
    be observed periodically to collect data. Wireless Sensor Networks are a key technology
    that can provide precise information, can update information, and can be a valuable
    resource to farmers to determine appropriate management practices. Using this
    technology, farmers can make real-time decisions such as scheduling irrigation
    periods, preventing diseases, choosing the right time for harvesting and so on.
    In this project, a Wireless Sensor Network system was designed and developed for
    remote real-time monitoring and collection of micrometeorological parameter data
    in three distant vineyards. The system was also used for monitoring the SO2 gas
    fumigation process and atmospheric parameters inside the drying structure. The
    system consists of a gateway and a series of peripheral wireless motes placed
    in the vineyards and inside the drying structure, which are equipped with agrometeorological
    sensors for environmental monitoring and for storing and transmitting data to
    the gateway. The gateway collects agrometeorological data and utilizes a wireless
    technology for data transmission and for communication between the motes and the
    central server (webpage). In addition, an on-line (real-time) warning system was
    embedded in the gateway to send alarm signals via SMS (Short Message Service).
    The devices were tested for software configuration functionality, hardware operation
    and data acquisition, energy consumption, and connectivity. Field experiment results
    demonstrated that the system represents a complete monitoring system, which provides
    efficient performance for developing information systems in precision viticulture.

    aggregation and integrationRaisinSouth Azerbaijan 1. Introduction According to
    the FAOSAT, Iran was the ninth largest grape producer in the world in 2012 (2150000
    MT). Additionally, in 2014 grape growing ranked second among horticultural products
    grown in Iran. The Azerbaijan provinces (South Azerbaijan) are the most important
    regions for grape growing in Iran, wherein more than 90% of the grape vineyards
    in these regions are traditional ones. Because of the cold weather and the environment
    of the region, the traditional vineyards are mainly in the form of large furrows.
    These specific furrows are called “Qana” in local Azerbaijani Turkish language
    and are a form of triangular prisms with a long base (approximately 25 × 22) two
    meters in height with a one-meter interval between every Qana (Fig. 1). Obviously,
    this particular kind of vineyard is not as productive as trellis ones, but they
    are more appropriate to the harsh environmental and climatic conditions of the
    region (extremely cold winters and extremely hot summers with −20 to 40 °C records).
    Additionally, the conversion of a traditional vineyard to a trellis one is costly
    and the majority of farmers cannot afford it, and so updates would require a nationally
    invested project. Instead, farmers could focus on utilizing suitable modern technologies
    to grow, tend, and monitor their vineyards to enhance efficiency and productivity.

    raisin exporters in the world, ranking third (after Turkey and the USA) in the
    world and accounting for 27% of the world’s raisin exports. Compared to the other
    agricultural activities in the region, raisin producing has become of paramount
    importance for its economic values and for the size of the population involved
    in this kind of husbandry and commerce. Traditionally, raisins are produced naturally
    by sun-drying and hanging the grape bunches outdoor inside a structure (Karimi,
    2015), as shown in Fig. 2. Drying the grapes in shade (inside the building) can
    preserve their natural flavor and color. First, the grapes are pretreated by immersion
    in 2% K2CO3 solution for ruining the natural wax coating and subsequently for
    increasing the drying speed (Dobbs et al., 2014, Karimi et al., 2011). The grapes
    are also fumigated with SO2 gas to control postharvest gray mold rot (Botrytis)
    and other decay-causing fungi, to preserve the golden color of the raisins, to
    prevent the enzymatic browning, and to facilitate the drying process (Franck et
    al., 2005, Karimi et al., 2015, Das et al., 2009, Karimi et al., 2017). According
    to the Codex standards of golden bleached raisins, the maximum limit applicable
    for sulfur dioxide is 1500 ppm (62,400 µmol m−3). Since excessive sulfur dioxide
    fumigation is extremely dangerous to human health, the process should be closely
    monitored and controlled. Furthermore, as the grapes are dried in the shade, the
    drying process is sensitive and the drying grapes (raisins) can be spoiled and
    molded by excessive humidity. Hence, the humidity and temperature of the building
    should be monitored. Download : Download high-res image (667KB) Download : Download

    insects, and animals can damage and depredate grape berries in vineyards, which
    can demolish the quality of grapes and raisins. By monitoring damage patterns
    and depredating species, it is possible to reduce damage or lower the cost of
    control by concentrating control methods in areas and seasons when damage is most
    severe. Precision Agriculture (PA) is one of the most modern and strategic farming
    systems that integrates information technology with management to increase long-term,
    site-specific, and whole-farm production efficiency and productivity. Precision
    Viticulture (PV) as a specific area of PA in vineyards being used to improve productivity
    and quality. Grape quality and yield depend on agricultural practices, climate
    and soil characteristics, pests, and environmental diseases. Accordingly, using
    these variables, PV can provide a management strategy to enhance grape and raisin
    quality. Generally, PV can simultaneously improve the yield and quality of grapes
    and their by-products. PV practices are performed based on acquiring, transmitting,
    and processing agglomerative data coming from a large-scale, heterogeneous sensor
    network. In recent years, Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technologies have been
    used efficiently to provide remote and real-time monitoring of high-quality production
    and processing systems. Therefore, WSNs can offer a more reliable and safe measuring
    process for grape and raisin production. By monitoring environmental conditions
    through ubiquitous devices called sensor nodes (or motes), a WSN connects the
    physical and computational world. These networks include a number of motes and
    one or more base stations. Usually, a base station with high processing and storing
    capacities is connected to many autonomous, cooperating, battery-powered, small-sized
    motes through wireless links and a gateway with the capability of gathering data
    from the motes. The motes integrate different sensors, from simple ones such as
    temperature, light, and humidity, to sophisticated ones including Global Positioning
    Systems, images, acoustic data, micro-radars, and so forth. In this manner, it
    is possible to monitor a wide range of environments to obtain precise online and
    real-time knowledge from the field. 2. Reasons and objectives of the project 2.1.
    Vineyard The quality of grapes is closely related to the quality of wine, raisin,
    grape syrup, vinegar, and other by-products. Therefore, a scientific understanding
    of viticulture and long-term monitoring of cultivation environment are required
    for smart viticulture management and, simultaneously, for increasing the quality
    of the by-products. In an attempt to monitor the cultivation environment, it is
    necessary to collect data at multiple locations in the vineyard for convenient
    cultivation management since field conditions such as soil moisture may vary even
    within the same vineyard (Togami et al., 2011). Furthermore, by monitoring the
    vineyard, it is possible to estimate, assess and understand the changes that occur
    in grape growing stages in order to determine irrigation, fertilizer, pesticide,
    and insecticide requirements, growth and ripening phases, and optimum points of
    harvesting as accurately as possible—in other words, to adequately predict various
    stages in grape production. For achieving these goals, it is necessary to collect
    as much information as possible on the water, soil, plants, and environment. PA
    is an important means for determining vineyard requirements and predicting growth
    stages of grapes by utilizing numerous technologies and infrastructures including
    data instrumentation and gathering systems, Geographic Information Systems (GIS),
    Global Positioning Systems (GPS), microelectronics, wireless technologies and
    so forth (López Riquelmea et al., 2009). There are many factors that affect the
    quality of grapes. Environmental variables such as temperature, solar irradiation,
    wind and moisture are the most important factors affecting grapevine phenology.
    Among them, temperature is the most important factor in vineyards. Other parameters
    should also be considered such as atmospheric humidity, soil humidity, and soil
    pH (Winkler, 1963). In general, environmental parameters can be detailed as follows.
    Temperature: One of the meteorological factors that can cause various damages
    to the vineyard including physiological damage or disorder, effects on the degree
    of maturity of the grape berries, frost/freeze damage resulting from low temperatures,
    fungi and diseases resulting from warm weather such as black rot, etc. The optimum
    temperature for fungal development during the growing season is 10–25 °C. The
    loss resulting from disease ranges from 5 to 80% depending on the amount of disease
    in the vineyard, weather, and cultivar susceptibility (Šrobárová and Kakalikova,
    2007). Humidity: An atmospheric parameter (present due to rain, dew, fog or irrigation)
    that is a major factor in fungal growth. Fungi caused by wet and dry weather include
    powdery mildew, downy mildew, and bunch rot. Additionally, excessive humidity
    can beget a dense canopy that will not only shade the fruits but also create a
    microclimate within the vineyard encouraging the spread of diseases. Furthermore,
    by measuring the environmental (and soil), humidity it is feasible to adjust the
    irrigation schedules. Soil Moisture: Water content or soil moisture is a result
    of a balance between water uptake (rainfall, precipitation, groundwater and irrigation)
    and water loss (seepage, evapotranspiration and drainage). Water stress can occur
    due to a lower moisture content in the soil. Furthermore, the lack of moisture
    during all seasons is responsible for slow development, low production, high sugar
    content, and a lack of acidity in wines. On the other hand, excessive moisture
    adversely affects the growth, productivity, and quality of grapes, and increases
    susceptibility to winter injury and disease. Soil pH: Improving the availability
    of mineral nutrients is one of the objectives in managing vineyard nutrient demand.
    Soil pH is a measure of soil acidity or alkalinity, which has a dramatic effect
    on the availability of several essential nutrients for grape growth. Soil pH levels
    that are too high or too low lead to a deficiency in many nutrients, a decline
    in microbial activity, a decrease in crop yield, and a deterioration of soil health.
    Low soil pH (pH 5.0 or lower) affects nutrient availability and root and shoot
    growth. Decreasing the soil pH from 5 to 3.5 results in increasing aluminum solubility
    so that the free and exchangeable aluminum ions affect nutrient availability and
    root growth. Additionally, a low pH prevents nitrogen cycling. High free aluminum
    precipitates phosphorus out of the soil solution and subsequently makes it unavailable
    to the plant. Exchangeable aluminum displaces calcium and magnesium, consequently
    decreasing their availability. Root growth is affected by aluminum toxicity, wherein
    it inhibits cell division in the root apical meristem. On the other hand, high
    pH soils present a different set of nutritional circumstances for grapevine roots.
    When soil pH increases from 5 to 8, aluminum insolubility removes it from the
    playing field. Accordingly, some of the phosphorus problems are obviated and the
    availability of calcium and magnesium is increased, but iron simultaneously precipitates
    out of the soil solution, limiting its availability. It is necessary to occasionally
    conduct soil tests to determine whether the soil pH has changed over time. Particularly,
    soils gradually acidify over time due to the removal of cations such as calcium,
    potassium, or magnesium either by leaching or uptake by plants, acid rain, or
    the reaction of certain nitrogen fertilizers in the soil (e.g., urea and ammonium
    nitrate). There are many other factors that can result in changing soil pH such
    as irrigation method, water quality, temperature, land use and management, the
    addition of nitrogen and sulfur fertilizers, etc. In warm, humid environments,
    soil pH decreases over time in a process called soil acidification due to leaching
    from high amounts of rainfall. In dry climates, however, soil weathering and leaching
    are less intense and pH can be neutral or alkaline. Hence, in order to prevent
    certain nutrient deficiencies, the soil pH should be approximately 5.5–6.5. Accordingly,
    the vines will not be debilitated and vulnerable to pest and disease attacks.
    Additionally, every year, the vines and grapes experience sequential growth cycles
    and phases so that every phase and stage has its own characteristics including
    the following: (1) Dormancy to Sprouting: In late January to early March the vines
    are awakened and pass the dormancy phase. During this change, the vines are pruned
    and begin to leak a colorless liquid, sometimes reddish; this is called the vine
    weeping phase. This phase usually lasts approximately three to four weeks. (2)
    Sprouting to Blooming: In April, when temperatures reach 10 °C, the sprouting
    phase begins. Buds swell and break, and initial small leaves appear. During this
    phase and during the subsequent blooming (flowering) phase, the vine is vulnerable
    to frost damage. During sprouting and flowering stages, water demand is low, so
    there are rarely water shortages. However, adequate moisture (water content) is
    required to promote bud break, root growth, shoot growth, and nutrient uptake.
    Water availability during the blooming stage is critical for continuous nutrient
    uptake, increasing fruitfulness, and potentially increasing berry size. (3) Blooming
    to Veraison: In late May, the blooming (flowering) phase occurs. The flowering
    consists of the flowers opening, resulting in fertilization. Lack of heat, excessive
    moisture, or lack of vigor of the plant can cause the flower to be incorrectly
    fecundated, and the grape bunches can have few berries (flowering shift). Adequate
    water during flowering can prevent a reduction in the potential harvest as a result
    of the reduced number of bunches. In July, the physiological maturity of the vine
    commences. The berries are still far from being mature grapes, but they have already
    started the ripening process. As August arrives, a phase called veraison (“Qora-Şirin”
    in the local spoken language) begins. In veraison, the berries’ greenish color
    changes to yellowish for white grapes and pinkish for red grape varieties. During
    the veraison phase, the acidity of the grapes decreases and the sugar amount is
    increased; sour berries become sugary, and their skin gradually softens. During
    the following growing seasons, the clusters are formed (after blooming), wherein
    adequate water is demanded. From fruit set to veraison, water is required for
    cell division, which determines berry size. Throughout this stage, the shoots,
    roots, and canopy are still growing, and the water demand is at its maximum level.
    Evapotranspiration values are also highest during this period and the volumes
    of replacing water can be high. This is the most crucial period to apply water.
    (4) Veraison to Harvest: During this stage, the maturation phase occurs. After
    veraison, a limited amount of water is preferable. Water is still required by
    the berries for cell expansion, but excessive moisture may promote shoot growth,
    hindering the vine’s acclimation process. Therefore, in order to achieve a balance
    between quality and productivity during the maturation phase, the amount of water
    has to be sufficient, but not too much. More importantly, during early September
    (before the harvest), the amount of sunlight and humidity between leaves and the
    soil surface (where the vines are lying down on the face of the Qana triangular
    prism) have the most striking effect on maturation and grape bunch plagues. Excessive
    sunlight can frazzle, scorch, and sear the grape berries. On the other hand, the
    humidity of this spatial zone beneath the leaves can result in plague and fungal
    diseases of the grape bunches, especially botrytis bunch rot (gray mold) and other
    fungal diseases such as black rot, sour rot, and downy mildew. Hence, in order
    to avoid such problems, the number of leaves has to be controlled by manually
    thinning the leaves or leaving them to remain. Near to harvest time from mid-September
    till mid-October, evapotranspiration values are much lower than earlier in the
    season, and root and shoot growth have essentially ceased. Hence, depending on
    the terrain characteristics (dry or wet), the grapes are ready to be harvested.
    It is extremely crucial to prioritize the harvesting operation according to the
    meteorological and geographical conditions of the vineyard. Importantly, uniform
    maturity is a factor that affects the quality of the raisin, and other by-products.
    The presence of hot or cold spots can result in variations in the degree of the
    fruit maturity. Moreover, the changes in the plant humidity throughout the entire
    growing season has a direct impact on the yield and grape quality. In case of
    water shortages and hot weather, the type of terrain is the most important factor
    that affects the vine moisture and grape maturity. The daily temperature profile
    is one of the most important environmental factors for grape quality, especially
    during the cold months and the month during the ripening phase. Real-time atmospheric
    temperature monitoring combined with historical data prediction could prevent
    frost effects. In the case of frost/freeze protection, monitoring air temperatures
    should be done throughout the vineyard, which is costly in terms of capital, labor,
    and operating costs. Additionally, the monitoring and analysis of humidity patterns
    for any phenological stage can also provide an effective way to avoid some crop
    pathogens, such as powdery mildew. Specifically, irrigation management is essential
    for high-quality grape production, and therefore it is necessary to measure soil
    moisture. Importantly, monitoring soil pH from blooming to veraison can notably
    provide conducive information about applying fertilizer to the vineyard. The WSN
    and PV technologies enable farmers to track the vineyard’s condition and progression.
    It is possible to compose an information database and use the data to support
    specific decisions and actions. Real-time data from a sensor network deployed
    in the field can be used by experts to make decisions such as the irrigation policy,
    to locate the spots of vineyards exposed to excessive sunlight, or to take the
    desired actions at the time when fungus or grape plagues are detected. Furthermore,
    WSN technology has other notable benefits such as being non-intrusive (with little
    to no human intervention) and being available for inexpensive prices. Additionally,
    because of some geographical factors such as the orientation and slope of the
    landscape, it is possible for vineyards located at different distances to have
    considerably different temperatures, humidity, etc. Thus, monitoring spatial variability
    of the conditions affecting the grapes can be feasible by deploying the appropriate
    sensor network. Lastly, WSN technology can be applied in vineyards to detect nuisance
    insects. In recent years, the region’s vineyards are suffering mainly from two
    kinds of insects, the cicada and the cricket. These insects damage grapevines
    primarily through their ovipositional activities such that vine growth is being
    affected adversely and severely. Cicadas especially have broken out, and the trees
    have been overwhelmed by the sheer numbers of the females laying their eggs in
    the shoots. Small trees have wilted and larger trees have lost small branches
    in some vineyards. These insects spend 17 years underground before crawling from
    the soil in late May and early June and immediately shedding their last immature
    skin to begin life as an adult. They immediately begin to sing, which they do
    incessantly from dawn to dusk. Their pathogenic existence and damage are concurrent
    with their strident singing sound (acoustic signals). By applying a WSN with its
    sensor nodes configured to sample audio signals and recording the sounds, it is
    possible to detect insects from their surrounding environment. 2.2. Drying building
    2.2.1. Drying process Generally, the processing and environmental data acquisition
    inside the drying buildings can be performed manually, visually, and occasionally,
    or it can be carried out using wired systems that are normally expensive and not
    flexible. Additionally, in regard to security and accessibility, these solutions
    are not secure or appropriate since it is necessary to hire workers to take measurements
    inside the fumigated and dangerously polluted environment and far inaccessible
    sections of the building. Uniform environmental conditions inside the building
    are required in order to maintain a high drying quality and, consequently, to
    produce raisins with higher quality. Thus, farmers must stay informed of the environmental
    factors and conditions inside the building such as humidity and temperature during
    the several weeks of the drying process. Therefore, the grape drying process inside
    the building can be monitored more easily and comfortably by deploying WSN technology
    and tools. 2.2.2. Fumigation process As was mentioned, the fumigation process
    is extremely sensitive and hazardous. If the fumigated amount of SO2 (dioxide
    sulfur) is low, the process will be useless and futile. On the other hand, excessive
    fumigation can ruin and vitiate the berries. Meanwhile, visually or manually monitoring
    the process is extremely dangerous to the workers’ health. Here, remote monitoring
    is the best solution. Consequently, by implementing WSNs the visual monitoring
    issue can be obviated without further ado. 3. Relevant research review In recent
    decades, there have been many different investigations using and implementing
    WSNs in various crop production applications. In regard to precision horticulture,
    López Riquelmea et al. (2009) presented the topology of a deployed network using
    four types of nodes (Soil Mote, Environmental Mote, Water Mote and Gateway Mote)
    to measure various soil properties such as temperature, volumetric moisture content,
    and salinity. The system was successful for the ecological monitoring of cabbage
    crop for the entire growing season with the required precision. Hwang et al. (2010)
    proposed an agricultural environment monitoring server system for monitoring information
    of an outdoor agricultural production environment utilizing wireless sensor network
    (WSN) technology. The proposed server system collected environmental and soil
    information outdoors through WSN-based environmental and soil sensors. Garcia-Sanchez
    et al. (2011), deployed WSNs in order to integrate video-surveillance and data-monitoring
    over distributed crops. They developed wireless node prototypes providing agriculture
    data monitoring, motion detection, camera sensors and long-distance data transmission.
    In another study, Jiang et al. (2013) reported an application of a web-based remote
    agro-ecological monitoring system for observing spatial distribution and dynamics
    of Bactrocera dorsalis (phytophagous insects) in fruit orchards. To achieve real-time
    system management and data inquiry, a remote control interface and a web-based
    decision support program was implemented to allow system administrators and users
    to remotely access the monitoring report of their farms via the internet from
    virtually anywhere. Srbinovska et al. (2015) carried out a research project on
    environmental parameter monitoring using wireless sensor networks, which was deployed
    in a pepper vegetable greenhouse. Their presented WSN system consisted of sensor
    nodes and a base station, which was used for measurement and data collection of
    parameters such as temperature, humidity, and illumination. Moreover, other studies
    have been conducted applying WSN technologies in agricultural services such as
    soil water content sensing (Pan et al., 2013, Sun et al., 2014), crop disease
    risk evaluation (Das et al., 2009, Rossi et al., 2010), fertilization, pesticide
    spraying (Santos et al., 2014), crop temperature sensing (O’Shaughnessy et al.,
    2013), remote sensing and control of an irrigation system (Kim et al., 2008),
    autonomous closed-loop zone-specific irrigation (Goumopoulos et al., 2014) and
    valve control (Coates et al., 2013, Dobbs et al., 2014), automated irrigation
    management based on the water content and temperature of soil, humidity, temperature,
    wind speed, and irradiance (Nikolidakis et al., 2015), and frost protection and
    dew condensation prevention (Park and Park, 2011, Pierce and Elliott, 2008). Specifically,
    for a precision viticulture (PV) application, researchers have conducted outstanding
    projects using WSNs. Burrell et al. (2004) presented a study on the potential
    use of sensor networks to aid work in vineyards. They described a variety of sensor
    network configurations and applications that can address different priorities
    of the vineyard. Beckwith et al. (2004) implemented a 65-node multi-hop WSN in
    a vineyard for six months. The collected information was used for addressing two
    important parameters of heat summation and potential frost damage in wine production.
    Morais et al. (2008) used a ZigBee multi-powered wireless acquisition device for
    remote sensing applications in PV. They designed a platform for that purpose called
    MPWiNodeZ, as a ZigBeeTM network element that provides a mesh-type array of acquisition
    devices for vineyards. Shah et al. (2009) designed a PV framework in the vineyards
    at Nashik, Maharashtra, India. They deployed wireless sensor nodes equipped with
    soil moisture, ambient temperature, relative humidity, and leaf wetness sensors.
    Data collected by the sensors were wirelessly transferred in a multi-hop manner
    to a base station node (approximately 700 m away from the mote) connected with
    an embedded gateway for data logging and correlation. The embedded gateway base
    station performed elementary data aggregation and filtering algorithms and transmitted
    the sensory data to an agri-information server via GPRS. Additionally, Matese
    et al. (2009), designed a remote real-time system for monitoring and collecting
    micrometeorological parameters in a vineyard. The system comprised a base agro-meteorological
    station (Master Unit) and a series of peripheral wireless nodes (Slave Units)
    located in the vineyard. In this project, the Master Unit stored all of the Slave
    Unit data and, using a GSM/GPRS device, sent all the collected data to a remote
    central server. In 2011, an autonomous intelligent gateway infrastructure for
    in-field processing in precision viticulture was designed and installed in a vineyard.
    The infrastructure, named iPAGAT (Intelligent Precision Agriculture Gateway),
    ran an aggregation engine that fills a local database with environmental data
    gathered by ZigBee WSNs and it possessed embedded communication capabilities such
    as Bluetooth, IEEE 802.11, GPRS (for accessing both gateway and remote data by
    local and remote users), and the internet, and it ran site-specific management
    tools using authenticated smartphones (Peres et al., 2011). Accordingly, Fernandes
    et al. (2013) utilized this infrastructure (iPAGAT) and introduced a framework
    for WSN management for PV and agriculture based on IEEE 1451 standard. The framework
    consisted of a ZigBee end device (sMPWiNodeZ), an IEEE 1451 WTIM (Wireless Transducer
    Interface Module), and an IEEE 1451 NCAP (Network Capable Application Processor)
    that acts as a gateway to an information service provider, and a WSN coordinator.
    More recently, Reiser et al. (2017) designed and utilized a small 4-wheel autonomous
    robot that assembled the data from nodes distributed in a vineyard in order to
    overcome the limited transmission range of spatially separated nodes of a wireless
    sensor network (WSN). The current innovative systems and projects applying WSN
    technology to vineyards have their own merits for solving the multiple challenges
    existing in the modern vineyards. However, there are some factors that should
    be considered, improved, and ameliorated such as • Cost: The existing research
    and development state for selecting and implementing the components are considerably
    expensive. Specifically, in the traditional and deprived regions such as South
    Azerbaijan (wherein the devices are imported from foreign countries), the devices
    are not affordable to the end-users. For applications in such regions, reducing
    the system cost is utterly urgent. Thus, a low-cost application design is extremely
    necessary for selecting and implementing sensor nodes and hardware. • Energy-efficiency:
    In any WSN-based system, energy management is one of the most challenging issues.
    The amount of energy consumed by sensor nodes can be reduced by reducing the amount
    of communication in the network. This can be done by designing different system
    components and algorithms, or alternatively, by considering other potential energy
    harvesting solutions such as solar power, wind power, biomass, vibrations, power
    banks, and so on. • Complication: The hardware components and designed platforms
    used in the proposed WSN systems are sophisticated and therefore should be simplified
    and easy to use. In this manner, in order to ensure ease of operation for the
    end-users who are typically farmers and non-technical persons, human–computer
    interaction issues such as accessibility and usability should be considered in
    designing and developing the system’s architecture. • Traditional vineyard issues:
    Unlike in developed countries, the traditional vineyards in the region are partitioned,
    smaller, and personalized farming lands. Additionally, the structure of the vineyards
    is completely different from the modernized trellis ones. Thus, a specific and
    suitable deployment architecture is needed. • Raisin quality: Virtually all of
    the existing research projects are concerned with grape and wine quality only.
    However, the characteristics of grapes (such as sugar level, alcohol level, acidity,
    etc.) that are grown for wine are completely different from the grapes that are
    produced for raisins. To our knowledge, there is not any research on traditional
    vineyards and grape drying (raisin producing) structures. The aim of this research
    is to integrate and equip the traditional vineyards with simple and easily used
    architecture, low-cost devices, and low powered components, which are more felicitous
    and tailored to the need of the region’s farmers. 4. Materials and methods In
    this section, the implementation of the proposed system is described. First, the
    hardware-software design of the system, the communication protocols, and the topology
    of the system are presented. Finally, the energy issues and implementation details
    are explained. 4.1. Architecture design The hardware architecture of the system
    resembles the Master/Slave configuration (Fig. 3). The Slave Unit (SU) is composed
    of a series of wireless motes located in the various locations of the vineyard
    with their sensors for monitoring meteorological and environmental parameters.
    The SU utilizes wireless technology to communicate and transmit the data to the
    Master Unit (MU). The MU is a base station, i.e., the gateway, which collects
    data from the entire vineyard, and then stores and processes them. Additionally,
    the web page designed as the management software for the transmission function
    is used to provide a connection between the operator and the gateway. Other software
    is used for designing the database and hardware programming and is detailed in
    the following sections. Download : Download high-res image (367KB) Download :

    4.1.1. Hardware architecture 4.1.1.1. End devices (Motes) Each End Device (ED),
    or mote consists of one or more sensor and module inputs. Motes are composed of
    a processor, a radio module, a power supply and one or more sensors mounted on
    the mote itself or connected to it (López Riquelmea et al., 2009). The gateway
    sends a data reading request to the end device and consequently, the end device
    responds with the value from the sensors. The ED consists of two interface parts:
    the sensor and the wireless communication interfaces. The interfaces are imbedded
    in Arduino Board and are included as a sensor shield and nRF24L01 module for sensing
    and sending the data, respectively, so that the sensor interface receives the
    data from the sensors and sends it to the gateway via the wireless communication
    interface (nRF24L01 module). Therefore, the end device’s components are Arduino
    boards, modules, and sensors: Arduino Board: Arduino is an open-source project
    that creates microcontroller-based kits in order to build digital devices and
    interactive objects, whereby they sense and control physical devices. The main
    component of an Arduino board is an Atmel 8-, 16- or 32-bit AVR microcontroller
    with other synchronized components that provide programming and collaboration
    with other circuits. The Arduino project provides a cross-platform application
    written in the Java programming language, named Arduino’s integrated development
    environment (IDE). IDE is a programming environment in which the codes (sketches)
    are written, compiled and uploaded into the embedded microcontroller. The Arduino
    series that was used in this project was the Arduino Uno, Nano, and Micro, which
    are based on the ATmega328P and ATmega32U4 microcontrollers’ board. Modules: Various
    sensor modules are connected to a mote (ED) in order to acquire the data and transmit
    them wirelessly to the base station (gateway), where the data are stored. The
    modules utilized in this work include nRF24L01 module, VS1003 acoustic module,
    GSM module, and U-blox NEO-6M module (GPS receivers). Sensors: To monitor and
    acquire real-time data from the field, multiple types of sensors were integrated
    into the data acquisition network such as DHT11 digital temperature and humidity
    sensor, TGS 813 sensor for SO2 gas, PIR motion sensor, soil pH sensor, and EC-5
    soil moisture sensor. 4.1.1.2. Gateway architecture An Intel Atom processor with
    a 1.83 GHz has been used as the motherboard of the gateway (Fig. 3). This mini
    motherboard works with x86 architecture, wherein it supports all the software
    that can be installed on the real windows. Its size is 10 × 10 cm and it has 2G
    RAM and 32G eMMc. Other features of the device have been detailed in Table 1.

    Dimensions (10 cm × 10 cm) Power 5 V 3 A The Mini PC is connected to the peripheral
    motes through the receiver circuit. The receiver circuit’s components include
    Arduino UNO, Arduino Nano and Micro, a GSM module, an NRF24L01 receiver module,
    a power supply, M2596 (regulator), an external sound card, and antennas. The gateway
    is the heart of the proposed system, and it runs all the management operations
    such as managing the received and transmitted data, optimizing the energy consumption
    in the motes, pooling the motes, and managing the alarms. The gateway consumes
    a 5 V–2 A energy source, and it uses mains electricity. However, two rechargeable
    batteries are also used in the case of emergencies. To manage the limited energy
    capabilities and consequently prevent the system’s shutdown, a “pooling” technique
    was ingrained into the gateway architecture. Pooling is one of these methods,
    which functions based on an on-demand approach. In the continuous approach, the
    motes send the data periodically according to the defined amount of time, without
    any management techniques. In this form of operation, the motes are working in
    continuous mode and, since the maximum amount of energy is consumed by the receiver
    and transmitter modules, the energy consumption and lifetime of the network are
    affected. However, the system can be designed based on on-demand measurements,
    as well. In this method, the gateway inspects the mote data in order to shift
    their sleeping mode to the active mode and actuates them to send their data to
    the gateway and then return to the sleeping mode. Additionally, the time of the
    inspection operation can be adjusted according to the different seasons and conditions.
    For example, inspection can be done in minute, hourly, or daily rates instead
    of every 250 ms. Accordingly, the energy-efficiency and performance of the system
    can be optimized. In general, the gateway functions as the sink node of the WSN
    system, whereby the gateway’s Mini PC is connected to the sink motes (via the
    receiver circuit) and monitoring center (Fig. 3). The gateway also executes other
    duties such as data aggregation, real-time warning system, web access with Ethernet
    cable and Wi-Fi, network management, and environmental data resource. 4.1.2. Software
    design In this section, all the software specifications that were used in this
    project are described. In Fig. 4, the flowchart of the end device and the gateway
    function is presented. Furthermore, the functional description of the software
    architecture of the gateway and the motes (end devices) is presented in Fig. 5.

    The functional description of the gateway’s software architecture and the peripheral
    motes. Software specifications include the following: (a) Microcontroller: The
    Arduino IDE was used as a code editor and code burner. By connecting to the Arduino
    hardware, the IDE (Integrated Development Environment – or Arduino Software) makes
    it feasible to upload programs and communicate with them. (b) Web-Server: A simple
    HTML/AJAX running on the gateway was used in this work. Using AJAX, web pages
    can be updated asynchronously by exchanging data with a web server behind the
    scenes. In other words, updating parts of a web page can be executed without reloading
    the entire page. The XAMPP application was used for the web server, which is comprised
    chiefly of the Apache HTTP Server, MySQL database, and interoperates for scripts
    written in the PHP programming language. (c) On-line warning system: The warning
    system is a software that is installed within the overall system. The online warning
    system designed for the project is a system based on a webpage, which works according
    to the defined threshold of parameters such as temperature, humidity, soil pH,
    soil moisture, motion, and gas concentration level. The codes were written in
    Brackets IDE with HTML and JavaScript. In this system, an alarm is sent to the
    operator via the webpage. Accordingly, the operator (farmer or manager) will manually
    or automatically take appropriate actions in order to obviate the problems. Additionally,
    the system stores the alarms in the database, and by using the designated lights
    on the webpage, warns the operator. Furthermore, the proposed system is able to
    send these alarms to the operator via SMS. To perform this kind of communication
    and connectivity, a SIM900A module was used on the gateway board. SIM900A module
    is a simple Arduino GSM module for sending SMS. The module supports communication
    in a 900 MHz band. Programming of this module, like other modules such as nRF24L01,
    is performed in Arduino IDE. Hence, the online warning system alarms the operator
    via SMS and the webpage. The system generates alarm signals in order to warn of
    probable frost, likely disease, irrigation schedule, pH abnormality, an anomaly
    in fumigation and drying processes, and motion changes. The online warning system
    checks the data from the gateway in order to compare the sensor readings stored
    in the database with the limits defined by the minimum and maximum amounts of
    parameters for every measured condition such as frost, excessive fumigation and
    so forth. While the evaluated parameters are exceeded or declined, a signal (alarm)
    is sent by the system to the operator via SMS and the webpage. For instance, if
    the air humidity reaches 95% and air temperature decreases to 3 °C, an automatic
    alarm is generated and sent via SMS and webpage. The operating rule codes are
    uploaded to the gateway, which contains the defined threshold values of the parameters
    that are used by the online warning system in order to send the alarms. For example,
    the “frost Prediction” alarm can be scripted as the following schematic algorithm
    (rule): If (Day > 80 && Day < 120) {  if (Temp < 3 && Hum > 95)   {   char number
    [ ] = “0914∗∗∗∗∗∗”;   char message [40] = “Frost Prediction”;   sms.SendSMS (number,
    message);  } } (d) Database: MySQL programming language was used to run on the
    client computer. The software architecture of the gateway is constructed as a
    relational database management system. Similar to the hardware and software of
    this system, the database architecture has been designed more simply. Fig. 6 shows
    the structure of the designed database as part of the employed software. The database
    system functions in a real-time manner. While the system operates based on the
    continuous mode, the system receives real-time data (every 250 ms) and stores
    them in the relevant tables in the database. However, in the on-demand mode, the
    system receives data according to the operator’s request. While the data are stored
    in tables, their values are relationally compared with the threshold values of
    the warning conditions, which are specified in the alarm table. Therefore, once
    each condition occurs, the system informs the operator by means of the provided
    methods (SMS or webpage). In Fig. 7 the functional flowchart of the overall system
    is depicted. Download : Download high-res image (549KB) Download : Download full-size

    of the overall system. 4.1.3. Connectivity capabilities In this project, the nRF24L01
    module was used for communication and transmitting data between the EDs (motes),
    sink motes, and the gateway (base sink). The standard SPI protocol and pins (CSN,
    SCK, MOSI, MISO), with the additional CE (for controlling the RX/TX and standby
    modes) and IRQ signals (for informing the SPI master about the completion of a
    packet reception/transmission) are used by this chip. To ensure a smooth data
    flow between the radio front end and the system’s MCU (Master Control Unit) or
    the gateway, internal FIFO manages the data flow. Furthermore, communication between
    the gateway and the monitoring center is executed with Ethernet cable and Wi-Fi.
    Communicational protocols used in this proposed monitoring system consist of the
    two following categories (Fig. 8): (1) The connection between the sink motes (of
    the EDs), the receiver circuit, and the Mini PC of the gateway: This connection
    between the sink motes of the EDs, and between sink motes and the receiver circuit,
    is performed based on SPI protocol. Using this protocol, it is possible to manage
    hardware-software properties (such as baud rate, bit rate, configuration register,
    etc.), to synchronize all EDs, sink motes (N1, N6, and N11 motes), and the gateway
    and to ensure receipt of the data (ack or nack). Moreover, the connection between
    the receiver circuit and the Mini PC of the gateway is performed using USB protocol.
    The USB is also a power resource for modules and Arduino boards. The C# coding
    language was used for port scanning functions, whereby the Mini PC scans the data
    (received by the receiver circuit), puts them in the variables, and does the following
    operations: (a) using an Ethernet interface (or Wi-Fi), sends the data to the
    monitoring center and (b) stores the data in the database in order to access them
    as it is needed. (2) The mechanisms and protocols between the gateway and monitoring
    center: Ethernet port (using the network cable) and Wi-Fi were used for this kind
    of connectivity in order to enable the users to access the gateway. In addition,
    SMS sending and Bluetooth link capabilities are provided. Furthermore, the data
    aggregation task is performed simply and robustly. The gateway receives the EDs’
    transmitted data and stores them in the database and the relevant tables. Download

    of connection methods between the hardware. 4.1.4. Topology Topology determines
    how the devices are interconnected. A star topology was used in this investigation.
    In this kind of topology, the gateway functions as a central processing unit so
    that it gathers sensor readings from all EDs. In a star topology, every sink mote
    is connected to a central node (gateway or MCU), which acts as a channel to transmit
    messages. 4.2. Energy Sensing, computation, and radio operations such as receiving
    and transmitting are three types of activities that consume the majority of the
    power in a mote. Since radio operation activity uses the majority of the power,
    an energy efficient plot should be concentrated on decreasing the amount of time
    devoted to receiving and transmitting operations. The power consumption of a mote’s
    receiving activity is higher than the transmitting activity. There are two modes
    of receiving and transmitting, wherein each mode has a different energy consumption
    level and has a direct effect on the network’s durability. (1) Continuous mode:
    In this method, the motes continuously send the data, and they have to be active
    and respond to the gateway’s requests. Obviously, in this mode, the lifetime of
    the motes and network will be decreased. (2) On-demand mode: During this mode,
    the motes are in the sleep condition. When the motes receive a request from the
    gateway they turn on and, having responded to the request, they return to the
    sleep mode. Accordingly, the network traffic is reduced because of the decrease
    in the sampling frequency. Hence, this mode has less energy consumption than the
    continuous mode, and the network’s lifetime is increased. Since the energy consumption
    in the WSN is the most challenging issue and the battery is a more common source
    of energy, using the best mode for optimizing consumption of energy is inevitable.
    4.3. Stipulation and deployment Before installing the system in the harsh and
    natural conditions of the vineyards, the system was tested under laboratory conditions
    between December 2015 and February 2016, in order to assay the accuracy and channel
    resolution of the motes and gateway boards. Subsequently, all the hardware were
    calibrated according to their data sheets and installed in the WSN. All the executable
    codes were manually downloaded into the associated microcontrollers of the motes.
    A unique identifier was attributed to each mote. Both the source and binary codes
    were checked in order to detect and correct faults and errors. The energy source
    for the motes was provided in two methods and every method was evaluated and tested.
    For the EDs, two means of energy supply were used and tested: (1) rechargeable
    common batteries and (2) rechargeable lithium batteries. Since the power bank
    was utilized in the second method, the system was able to have an approximately
    one-month duration. However, for the gateway, DC power was used. Since the gateway
    had access to unlimited electricity, it was able to work permanently. To create
    wireless connectivity, nRF24L01 was used. This module can transfer data in a 1600 m
    distance range and has “auto ack” capability, which provides certainty in receiving
    the data. For testing this module, one thread of data was sent 1000 m from the
    transmitter and on the other end, the data was received correctly without errors.
    Finally, by adding this module to the project’s board, the data were received
    singularly and wholly. Accordingly, the sensor motes were physically located in
    the fields. 4.3.1. Vineyards Having carried out the tests, the system components
    were implemented in the vineyards. Three disparate and distant experimental vineyards
    were used in the project (Fig. 9). The climates of these three vineyards were
    different. The climate of the first vineyard, named Yovşanlıq, is dry, the second
    vineyard (Mıncıqlı sector) is a medium climate, and the third one (Minə) is semi-humid.
    The cultivated grapes of the vineyards were white and red Thompson seedless grapes.
    However, the majority of the grapes were white (more than 98%). The area of the
    Minə, Mıncıqlı, and Yovşanlıq vineyards is 130 × 138 m2, 130 × 141 m2, and 210 × 132 m2,
    respectively. The vine trees in every vineyard were pruned during the spring.
    As is shown in Table 2, five motes were implemented in each the Minə and Mıncıqlı
    vineyards, and seven motes in the Yovşanlıq vineyard were in the desired spots
    (totally 17 motes). To protect the motes from rain and environmental damages,
    a package was designed to plug in the mote’s components. The motes were fastened
    to a bar with the height of 0.5 m to keep soil sensors close to both the ground
    and vines. The gateway was placed outside the vineyard in the monitoring site
    in order to evaluate the system’s performance in term of range, robustness, and
    flexibility and to assess the microclimatic variability corresponding to the management
    practices within the various areas. Download : Download high-res image (279KB)

    4.3.2. Drying building Thirteen motes were installed within the drying building,
    with three of them being used for the fumigation process and the remaining ten
    motes used for the drying process. For the fumigation process, just one sensor
    was used (SO2 gas sensor), but for the drying process, two sensors including humidity
    and temperature were utilized. Once the field tests, installation, and implementation
    processes were completed, the motes were activated and the WSN system was initiated.
    The data from each mote were received by the gateway (base station). Subsequently,
    the data were stored in a database in order to be processed and depicted in the
    web page. The updated data obtained from the vineyards were extracted and presented
    by the web page. The operator or vineyard owner exploits the provided information
    to make the right decisions and takes appropriate actions to handle and manage
    the problems and issues relevant to the vineyards. All the data received from
    the motes were stored in textual files in the database and were presented in the
    webpage in the monitoring center. This webpage is the software of the monitoring
    system, which is used for management. Storing the data in a text file in the database
    makes it possible to create graphs of hourly, daily or longer interval data reports
    and trends to analyze the environmental variables. 5. Experimental results and
    discussions The designed system was user-friend and easy to use. The web page
    (Fig. 10, Fig. 11) provided the following main functions: real-time data, historical
    data, mote management, and user management. The user can observe the data from
    each sensor of the motes in real-time and access the historical data by selecting
    the time range for acquiring the data with a simple point-and-click. In addition,
    the mote management functions allow the user to check the status of the network
    and actual motes. By using this option, the user can check the condition of each
    mote in order to replace batteries or to troubleshoot the technical faults and
    re-deploy the troubled motes. The user can reach to every mote and observe each
    sensors’ data by means of the displayed charts and numerical presentations. Moreover,
    a user carrying smart devices such as a smartphone, tablet, or PDA (via SMS and
    Wi-Fi) can monitor the state of the field and the in situ sensors. Download :

    the drying structure motes (from N18 to N30). In the proposed system, adding new
    motes can be done without further change or expense. Compared to the other proposed
    systems, changing the hardware-software architecture of the current system is
    not costly because it is not necessary to upgrade hardware boards or to change
    their programming logics. The gateway, despite having lower software-hardware
    complications, was able to operate all the desired functions and tasks in the
    traditional vineyards, and it monitored the defined warning conditions accurately.
    Furthermore, using a Mini PC as the motherboard of the gateway obviated traditional
    systems’ limitations. One of the conventional methods of designing a gateway board
    is to utilize an Ethernet shield or the RS232 connector, which has some disadvantages.
    For example, an Ethernet shield has a lower speed, uses an SD card for saving
    the data and is limited in connection methods to the monitoring center. By using
    the Mini PC, these limitations were eliminated. Particularly, using the Mini PC
    in the proposed system was beneficial for enhancing the connection and communication
    capabilities and performance speed, reducing the SDOF (Single Point Of Failure)
    malfunction potentiality (by installing the security software), being used as
    the monitoring center (because of having of the HDMI interface), having remote
    access desktop capability (using remote access software tools such as TightVNC
    and so on), installing various desired software (due to possessing the Windows
    operating system), and getting access to the database comfortably and speedily.
    Additionally, the operating system of the Mini PC is flexible and easily usable.
    Its OS toolsets are easily extensible to user’s specific needs. Moreover, the
    communication stack in the default libraries has the considerable characteristics
    of usability, simplicity and resource efficiency so that the users can use it
    without extra complexity. External memory support for user data storage in the
    Mini PC is provided. The users do not have to worry about sensor data—they are
    depicted automatically. Finally, all the required software can be installed easily.
    The tests pertaining to the energy consumption indicated that using common batteries
    makes the motes stable for one week. However, as shown in Fig. 12, by using an
    on-demand approach, the energy consumption of the batteries was decreased and
    their lifetime was increased. Fig. 12 shows a typical daily and weekly energy
    consumption of the utilized batteries with the continuous mode vs. the same application
    using the on-demand mode. As depicted in the figure, in comparison with the continuous
    mode, the lifetime of the system was increased by 43.75% using the power source
    with the on-demand mode. Additionally, when utilizing the power bank facilities,
    the lifetime of the batteries increased to one month. During continuous weeks
    of monitoring, every battery’s condition was monitored by the operator using the
    webpage in order to recharge or replace the weak batteries. Download : Download

    nRF24L01 modules were easily able to perform data transference with a 1600 m distance
    range. In addition, instead of using overpriced boards, these low-cost modules
    were utilized, and by modifying and changing their baud-rates and registers, it
    was possible to provide the modules’ performance analogous to the costly ones.
    The results of the vineyards and drying process monitoring are detailed below.
    5.1. Vineyards The developed system was deployed in three vineyards located in
    Qurijan (Qurucan) village in South Azerbaijan. The system was used from March
    to November 2016. The farmers were using traditional irrigation methods within
    the vineyards. The prime objective of utilizing this technology was to provide
    predictive information about the gardens in order to improve the quality of the
    grapes and raisins. The measured parameters were humidity, soil pH and moisture,
    movement detection, GPS, and temperature. Data acquisition processes were mainly
    divided into the following seasons: (1) Spring (lasting from March to June): During
    April, temperature and air humidity sensors were simultaneously activated in order
    to monitor variations in temperature and predict the frost. The sensors were demanded
    to monitor nocturnal and diurnal variation of the temperature and humidity from
    20o’clock until 8o’clock in the morning (of the next day). Fig. 13 depicts two
    typical nightly and daily variation of the temperature and humidity in the vineyards.
    Three motes were selected from each vineyard (N2, N7, and N12 motes). It was observed
    that the hours near to dawn (between 4 and 6o’clock) are the hours most at risk
    of frost damage. This means that during these hour intervals, the vineyards are
    extremely susceptible to frost harm, which resulted from “radiation freezes”.
    Radiation freezes occur on calm, clear nights (without any clouds) when the heat
    from the ground radiates upward. Since the cold air is heavier than the warm air,
    it settles in areas of lower elevation. As the cold air stays low and the warm
    air rises, the air becomes stratified and a temperature inversion forms. Additionally,
    as seen in Fig. 13, before the break of dawn, the air humidity reaches its maximum
    range in the vineyards. Simultaneously, an increase in air humidity and a reduction
    in temperature can precipitate frost occurrence. The data from the sensors showed
    that Minə vineyard was the most vulnerable vineyard to the frost harm. Hence,
    it was suggested that the farmer install and apply frost protection equipment
    and methods during April (of every year) within the vineyards. Download : Download

    this season, other sensors including humidity, PIR, GPS, and acoustic modules
    were active. A GPS sensor was installed on just one end device of every vineyard
    (N1, N6, and N11). The PIR sensor was utilized to protect the implemented end
    devices from intruders such as wild animals. During the season, no intruders were
    observed. Additionally, the acoustic modules were activated during May in order
    to record the sounds of depredating insects. During this month, the acoustic modules
    were activated daily around lunchtime. In Yovşanlıq vineyard, cricket songs were
    detected. Accordingly, insecticides were deployed to the vineyard in order to
    extirpate the nuisance insects. Furthermore, during this season, the pH sensors
    were turned on weekly in order to record soil pH variations. (2) Summer (June
    to September): During this season, soil pH, soil moisture, temperature, and humidity
    sensors were active. Concurrently, acoustic modules were actively used. During
    these consecutive months, soil moisture records provided updated data in order
    to irrigate the vineyards. As shown in Fig. 14, continuous monitoring of the soil
    moisture level provided the data for scheduling irrigation times within each vineyard.
    The peak points in every linear graph indicate the times that the vineyards were
    irrigated. Minə and Mıncıqlı vineyards were irrigated five times, but the Yovşanlıq
    vineyard was irrigated six times. The data indicate that because of the dry climate,
    water evaporation speed within Yovşanlıq vineyard is greater than in the other
    two vineyards. However, it is possible to accumulate and save moisture content
    by increasing irrigation duration and frequency. In addition, it was observed
    that while the irrigation duration increases, the moisture content also increases.
    This correlation demonstrates that longer irrigation times lead to the deeper
    penetration of water and higher moisture content. Download : Download high-res

    of the soil moisture and soil pH. In addition, during early June it was observed
    that the soil pH of Mıncıqlı was trending towards alkalinity (Fig. 14). To lower
    the pH to 6.5 and 6, a urea fertilizer was used in the vineyard. As depicted in
    Fig. 14, applying a urea fertilizer had a significant effect on maintaining the
    desired soil pH level in Mıncıqlı vineyard. Furthermore, zonal (beneath leaves)
    humidity sensors were also active during the summer months. Zonal humidity (spaces
    under the leaves) is extremely critical during August and September. As presented
    in Fig. 15, in Minə and Mıncıqlı vineyards, the zonal humidity was observed to
    be increased on 4 and 7 August, respectively, during which the farmer received
    the warning alarms via SMS. To avoid being exposed to probable fungal diseases,
    the leaves of the vines were thinned by the employed artisans. However, for Yovşanlıq
    vineyard, since the air temperature was immoderate, in order to protect the grape
    bunches from sun burning damage, the leaves were not thinned. Download : Download

    and temperature. It has been found that temperature and humidity are the most
    crucial parameters for improving the quality of the final products. In the cases
    of Minə and Mıncıqlı vineyards, humidity had the highest effects, whereas in Yovşanlıq
    vineyard, the temperature had the paramount importance. Another conducive parameter
    with a direct impact on the quality of the grapes and raisins is the sugar level
    of the berries. Since the WSN reported excessive zonal humidity (between the leaves
    and the face of Qanas) of Minə and Mıncıqlı vineyards, the leaves were trimmed
    in order to increase the amount of sunlight received by the vines. Consequently,
    the sugar level, flesh, and volume of the mature berries increased. However, because
    of the inherently dry climate of Yovşanlıq vineyard, the leaves of the vines were
    not trimmed. Accordingly, the schedule of harvesting time was determined and postulated
    by the system, resulting in the farmer first harvesting Yovşanlıq vineyard in
    early September and Minə and Mıncıqlı vineyards in late September. 5.2. Drying
    structure The WSN system was used during October in order to monitor the fumigation
    and drying processes. In the fumigation process, three motes were utilized in
    every round of fumigation. To keep even and uniform diffusion, circulation, and
    concentration of the SO2 gas through the grape bunches, the motes were used in
    three disparate sections of the fumigation chamber inside the covering nylon.
    The motes were used in every round of fumigations. Using the WSN system, direct-close
    inspection and monitoring procedures were eliminated. Fig. 16 displays continuous
    monitoring for a typical round of the fumigation process. The webpage provided
    continuous monitoring via the relevant diagram and warning system. Additionally,
    the SMS module sent alarms in case of inordinate and lesser amounts of SO2 gas.
    As seen in Fig. 16, after 30 min, the amount of SO2 gas was decreased to 1392 ppm
    (57,907.2 µmol m−3). The operator received this inconvenient insufficiency by
    SMS, and, subsequently, an amount of sulfur powder was added to the sulfur container
    inside the chamber. This calibrated amount of sulfur powder was consumed in the
    next round. Download : Download high-res image (96KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 16. Continuous monitoring for a typical round of the fumigation process.
    After every fumigation round, the nylon was unwrapped in order to let atmospheric
    air circulate through the grapes inside the building. One mote was implemented
    between every two columns in the back side beyond the hung grapes (between the
    wall and suspended grape bunches), where it is not approachable or accessible
    (Fig. 2). Generally, 10 motes were used inside the building during October and
    November in various locations of the drying building (structure). The humidity
    and temperature of the inside building were continuously monitored. During late
    October, since the air temperature plummeted in the region, the online warning
    system sent a rot prediction alarm via SMS and webpage. Subsequently, the raisin
    producers avoided the problem by providing a constant ventilated hot air flow
    inside the drying structure at 60 °C. Finally, in November, all the produced raisins
    (at 18% moisture content level) were gathered and stored in the storage room.
    The result showed that applying the WSN monitoring system in the vineyards and
    drying structure increased the quantity and quality of the grapes and final products.
    Particularly, grape and raisin production yield was increased 4 t/ha compared
    to the yield of the year before. Grape yield depends greatly on cultivation and
    climatic conditions and varies from one variety to another. This leads to a wide
    range of yields across the world: from 6 to 12 t/ha in France to 20–30 t/ha in
    the USA, especially in California (http://www.oiv.int/public/medias/4911/fao-oiv-grapes-report-flyer.pdf).
    According to the Ministry of Agriculture, the average yield of grape production
    in Iran is approximately 12 t/ha. In comparison with the average national yield,
    the yield was nearly increased to 6 tons per hectare (0.544 kg/m2). This means
    that the system was able to increase the yield more than 28%. Furthermore, inside
    the drying structure, raisins were produced without any dissipating damages stemmed
    from excessive fumigation or fungi. 6. Conclusion This paper shows WSN-based precision
    viticulture in traditional vineyards and drying processes. The system was developed
    on the basis of other successful experiences with wireless sensor network systems
    and decision-making supports in agriculture. The main components of the system
    are a gateway (composed of a Mini PC and receiver circuit) and thirty peripheral
    motes with installed relevant modules (nRF24L01 module, VS1003 acoustic module,
    GSM module, and GPS receivers) and sensors including temperature, humidity, soil
    pH and moisture, SO2 fumigation, and PIR. To display and browse the data, a web
    interface (Graphical User Interface; GUI) was designed to provide the vineyard
    locations on Google Maps, the graphical representations, the gauge charts, and
    the numerical data display. The webpage provides the desired data at the user’s
    request with simple clicks. The experimental results proved that the system reliably
    and satisfactorily performs the desired duties with simple architecture and devices
    and at reasonable prices. Using a Mini PC as the motherboard of the gateway has
    some considerable advantages such as a lower implementation cost, extended capabilities
    and easy changing of software-hardware, and being user-friendly, portable, and
    easy to use. Particularly, the proposed system offers great flexibility for using
    continuous modes and on-demand requests based on pooling mechanism. The results
    indicate that by using the system with an on-demand approach, the lifetime of
    the motes and the utilized power supply is increased. The implemented approach
    actuates the motes at the user’s demand to switch their sleeping/active modes
    whenever they are needed and to consequently save the energy supply. The system
    is able to predict imminent frost using real-time data of temperature and air
    humidity sensors located in the vineyards. By measuring the soil moisture and
    air humidity parameters, the system provides feasibility of scheduling the irrigation
    frequency. More importantly, the system is able to determine the optimum irrigation
    duration for each vineyard according to their climatic conditions. The overall
    results imply that since the amount of irrigated-evaporated water is high, flood
    irrigation (traditional irrigation) is not an efficient method. By obtaining soil
    pH data, the system is able to predict, warn, and monitor the nutrition deficiencies
    of the terrain. Furthermore, by measuring the data of the zonal (between the surface
    of the ‘Qana’ and leaves) humidity sensors, the system is able to prevent probable
    fungal diseases and sun burning damages. Consequently, the leaves controlling
    procedure is decided by the farmer so that in the case of immoderate humidity,
    the leaves of the vines can be thinned and in the case of too much heat, the leaves
    can remain untouched. As a result, the vineyards that receive more controlled
    sunlight grow larger berries. Finally, using the data obtained from the vineyards,
    the system can predict and schedule the harvesting time. Regarding the drying
    building (structure), the fumigation process can be continuously monitored in
    order to control the amount of SO2 gas inside the fumigation chamber. Importantly,
    by monitoring the process, the farmer can calibrate the amount of sulfur powder
    used. Subsequently, by continuously monitoring the humidity and temperature inside
    the building, the system can detect and predict the imminent rot damage. These
    experimental results suggest that a traditional drying building equipped with
    the proposed WSN-based system can serve as a useful platform for monitoring the
    drying process and subsequently for increasing the quality of the produced raisins.
    Finally, the proposed system is helpful for increasing the quality and quantity
    of the grapes and raisins. It is able to prevent probable diseases, foresee the
    nutrition demands, schedule and determine irrigation duration and frequency, and
    warn of predating insects. Specifically, by using the WSN data, farmers are able
    to schedule harvesting time based on maturity, quality, and productivity. 7. Future
    improvements This project can be extended in future studies in order to improve
    the system in various domains such as (1) The online warning system was not able
    to generate an alarm warning of the presence of nuisance insects. This warning
    system needs a comprehensive signal processing research project in order to detect
    and distinguish the depredating insect sounds from other environmental sounds.
    Moreover, an image processing method can be added to the system for recognizing
    deficiencies, pests, diseases, and other detrimental agents in the vineyards.
    (2) Sap-flow measurements as an indicator of vine transpiration and plant water
    status throughout the season can provide an alternative tool to optimize and manage
    irrigation. In future work, this method can be applied in the current WSN system.
    (3) Luminosity as a key factor of brightness analysis for estimating light radiation
    on plants can be applied for determining the sugar concentration, controlling
    the amount of sunlight received by the vines, and determining the optimum time
    for harvesting more accurately and timely. Furthermore, by utilizing light sensors,
    the WSN system can detect the presence of clouds or rain that are extremely deleterious
    during harvesting time. (4) Future studies can be focused on applying automated
    control for decision support systems through integration with an automatic irrigation
    system, frost preventing system, SO2 fumigation system, nuisance insect extirpating
    system, etc. The control commands can be counted in a locally centralized manner
    and then transmitted wirelessly to the actuators located in the vineyards and
    drying structures. (5) The dried raisins are stored in bulk (in the storage or
    packing house) before further processing. The raisins should be stored in cool,
    dry rooms. Specifically, the equilibrium moisture content (EMC), the point at
    which the raisins are neither gaining nor losing moisture, is important. The value
    of the EMC depends on the material and the relative humidity and temperature of
    the air. To maintain such equilibrium in moisture content of the stored raisins
    and to monitor the other parameters of the stored raisins, a WSN can be applied
    inside the storage or packing houses. References Beckwith et al., 2004 Beckwith,

    Chennai, India Introduction Wireless sensor networks consists of battery powered
    nodes provided with a gathering of sensing procedures such as multi-media including
    audio and video and scalar data which includes magnetometer, temperature, vibration,
    light, infrared, etc. These operations need the most essential hardware component
    i.e. Sensors use more energy for detection of target, transmission and reception
    of data, processing of data, etc. The transmission of data requires more energy
    and this energy consumption is much dependent on the transmission distance mostly
    and quantity of data that has been transmitted. Clusters are grouping up of sensor
    nodes with a cluster head collecting information from peer nodes to transfer to
    base station or sink. In this section, clustering is at 1-hop distance methodology
    i.e. all the nodes are located at 1-hop distance to each other. The information
    about the location and sensor nodes distributions is used to design the data collection
    method in cluster structure. Optimal cluster heads selection (4) is used to determine
    the cluster heads by the network are selected, it is seen that packet and delay
    loss will occur in case of node failure. The failure of nodes may occur due to
    drain of energy in the sensor nodes, any physical or mechanical damage in a cluster
    of sensor nodes. To overcome the QOS loss when the sensor nodes are overlapping
    between the clusters an effective technique called Extended Weakly Connected Dominating
    Set (EWCDS) algorithm is proposed in that a route cluster is appointed to collect
    the information from cluster heads and transmit it to the sink or base station
    thus conserving the energy that would be utilised by other sensor nodes. Z-MAC
    is a hybrid medium access control protocol which has its best advantages. The
    medium access control concept determines the channel capacity and other concepts
    like flow control, congestion, collisions, etc. Z-MAC achieves high channel utilization
    and prevents collision between 2-hop neighbours in clusters at low cost. There
    are notable MAC protocols such CSMA (Carrier Sense Medium Access) Protocol or
    CSMA/CD and TDMA. CSMA and TDMA has its own advantages like robustness, low infrastructure
    necessity and TDMA on the other hand tackles hidden and exposed terminal problems
    but both the medium access control protocols has certain limitations which could
    be tackled at best using Z-MAC technology. Therefore we could Z-MAC is a combination
    of CSMA and TDMA protocols (1). The combined effect makes it a hybrid protocol
    with key advantage of contention definition and control. In short, during low
    contention Z-MAC utilises the CSMA effects and during high contention level TDMA
    effects could be utilised. Z-MAC and clustering are two important and notable
    concepts that are proposed for the additional benefits to achieve an energy efficient
    data transmission between sensor nodes within inter cluster or intra cluster wireless
    sensor network. SECTION II. Related Work Wireless Sensor network is a vast study
    which includes many techniques and algorithms for its best results on communication
    i.e. transmission of information. Clusters have evolved from hybrid tree structure,
    cluster heads compresses the information that needs to be sent to the sink or
    base station. The utilisation of channel forms the basic feature to be compared
    between CSMA and TDMA to get a conclusion on how Z-MAC works on ideal state. In
    this section clusters and Z-MAC together focuses on the disadvantages of S-MAC
    and T-MAC. Effective throughput between CSMA and TDMA Show All On ideal state,
    if the channel utilisation level of CSMA and TDMA is compared, Time Division Multiple
    Access technique out wins with the number of contenders being represented in the
    graph. The inference made is that Z-MAC is energy efficient and needs low synchronisation
    making a better Medium access control layer protocol on comparison with the S-MAC
    and T-MAC (2) which are both a hybrid interpretation of CSMA and TDMA. SECTION
    III. System Analysis In hybrid method the nodes close to the leaf nodes transmit
    the original data and the nodes very close to that of sink transmit data to sink
    in multi-hop methodology. To overcome the issues like tolerance and traffic load
    balancing in hybrid method a clustering method was introduced. Here clusters are
    categorised with all the sensor nodes (8). A Cluster Head (CH) was elected where
    all the sensor nodes send data to the CH and the CH sends it to the sink. In this
    section, we propose the Extended Weakly Connected Dominating Set scheme (EWCDS)
    to overcome the QOS loss. To select Cluster Head EWCDS algorithm was used. Generally,
    here we have a route cluster node in case of any overlapping of clusters. This
    route cluster node collects the data from more number of sensor nodes and sends
    it to the sink. If any node placed in the two different cluster group we will
    not elect that sensor node as a cluster node. At the same time if that node is
    placed between two hop communication, it will elect that node as a CH and nearby
    node are formed as cluster members. In this method, an important issue was to
    determine how big a cluster should be. If the size of the cluster is huge the
    larger the number of transmission required to collect data from sensor nodes within
    a cluster to the CH will be very high. Even if the cluster size is too small,
    the number of clusters will be large and the amount of collected data that the
    CH''s send to the sink will be large which will lead to the large amount of transmission.
    In order to overcome this issue we try to minimize the number of cluster group
    and cluster members. Generally, life-time of the network is increased due to energy
    conservation and harvesting. Wireless Sensor Networks consists of battery powered
    nodes which can transmit multimedia and scalar data. Here, data transmission highly
    dependent on the distance of transmission as well as the transmission data amount,
    and most of the energy is utilized. So, in order to conserve energy we use the
    Z-Mac technique. Z-Mac combines the strengths of TDMA and CSMA and the medium-access
    control (MAC) protocol which is designed for wireless sensor network. The sensor
    nodes are either in active mode or sleep mode. Here, the sensor nodes are in idle
    mode where, it keeps sensing and when a data arrives it swaps to active mode.
    Thus the sensor nodes have a high data rate with high energy efficiency. In Architecture
    diagram given below, there is a Data Unit which stores related data''s needed
    for future use. The Route Discovery unit identifies the routing paths used in
    the network. Route Maintenance manages the overall specifications of the routing
    path. The Behaviour analyser identifies and stores the characteristics every node
    in the network. Route Manager manages the entire working of the routing process.
    SECTION IV. Modules A. Cluster Formation Cluster formation is nothing but the
    process in which the sensor nodes are assembled into a large cluster. There are
    n no of nodes in a cluster and these nodes are clustered based on the same attributes
    and those belonging to a single area. and a network is formed by a cluster of
    individual nodes (4). Clusters are formed on the basis of great energy, coverage,
    buffer. Each sensor nodes inside a cluster transmit data to its leader also called
    as CH. There are many clusters which transmit data to the sink or base station
    periodically. Show All B. Cluster Head Selection Selecting the cluster head is
    a method of selecting the incoming and the outgoing gateway for the cluster. the
    head of the cluster is also a sensor node like any other nodes in the cluster.
    CH is selected dynamically or by LEACH process. The maximum energy containing
    node acts as the cluster head. The process of cluster formation causes a two-level
    hierarchy where the higher level hierarchy is formed by the CH node and the lower
    level hierarchy is formed by the cluster member nodes. The sensor nodes over send
    their data in a periodic manner to the corresponding CH nodes (4). The data is
    assembled by the CH nodes (thus the total number of transferred packets gets decreased)
    and to the base station (BS) or sink they are over headed to the other CH nodes
    either directly or through the intermediary communication. However, as the data
    is sent by the CH node to a higher distance than the common nodes. They inherently
    spend energy at a higher rate. A common solution to proportion the energy utilisation
    among the network nodes is to select subsequent new CH''s in a periodic manner(thus
    rotating the CH role amidst the nodes extra time) in each of the clusters. A typical
    example is given below. C. Route CH Selection Whenever the CH are selected by
    the nodes, it will check one condition if any node has two hop distance in given
    CH range. That node declares that it is the route CH and it will send selection
    request to all the neighbours. From nearby sensors the data is collected by the
    Rout CH and handed over to the given sink. Show All C. Route Discovery Route discovery
    is the process of selecting the route or path for the destination (3). It uses
    RREQ (route request) and RREP (route reply) for the route discovery process. In
    this process the RREQ is the broadcast message that is called as a route request
    i.e. the route CH sends all the sensor nodes a request for the path in the similar
    relationship cluster. When the destination is identified, the destination sends
    the uncast RREP through the same path. This is used to find the best path between
    the source and destination. D. Profile Collection All the Sensor nodes in the
    cluster send data to its corresponding CH, this CH will validate the sensor''s
    data with neighbour''s data and if any data of the sensor node is not unique to
    the remaining node''s data. It may assign a higher threshold value to that particular
    sensor node (6). Based on this scenario all the nodes collect the profiles. In
    the real time applications, the Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) usually consists
    of huge number of the sensor nodes of limited energy to monitor the environment.
    The efficiency in energy is A. one of the expected important challenges for WSN''s
    to extend the network life-time. There are several mostly interesting and used
    methods to reach this goal. In order to minimise the consumption of energy for
    the networks turning off the redundant sensor nodes and balancing the energy utilisation
    for the whole network are used. E. Node Elimination After acquiring the profiles,
    CH checks the validity of the profile values(7). If any one of the sensors has
    a high profile entry value, that sensor is reflected on as the one caused by false
    data injection. So, the CH will exclude that sensor node from the network. F.
    Data Aggregation Sensor networks are a group of sensor nodes which co-a. operatively
    sends the instinctively sensed data to the BS. These AS sensor nodes are battery-driven,
    an efficient way of utilizing power is essential so that the networks can be used
    for a long time and therefore it is necessary to reduce the data traffic inside
    sensor networks, decrease the amount of data that is been sent to BS. So, the
    data has to be assembled in an energy efficient manner so that eternity of the
    networks is enhanced (8). So, the CH assembles all the data and forwards the data
    to the corresponding sink node(5). This process will continue till life time of
    the network. Show All Results and Discussions S-MAC VS T-MAC S-MAC is a controversy-based
    random approach protocol with a fixed listen or sleep cycle. It uses a Co-ordinated
    sleeping mechanism that is similar to the energy conserving process of IEEE 802.11.
    Show All S-MAC In S-MAC the time frame is split into two: one for the sleeping
    session and the next is for a listening session. During listening session, sensor
    nodes can communicate with other nodes and send control packages such as SYNC,
    RTS, and CTS. To reduce the energy consumption is the real aim in S-MAC designing.
    Consumption of energy of all the sources identified previously leads to energy
    wastage (collision, overhearing, listening ideally, and expenditure control) while
    aiding better scalability and dismissal of collision. In order achieve the aim
    of design the S-MAC is comprised of three important components: periodic wake
    up and sleep, collision and avoidance, finally message passing. Show All T-MAC
    An answer with a firm duty cycle like the S-MAC is not desirable. To hold the
    maximum expected load the nodes must be arranged with an active time. And when
    the load goes below to that, the usage of that active time is not desirably made
    use and on idle listening the energy will be wasted. The idea of the T-MAC protocol
    is to decrease idle listening by transmitting all the messages in bursts of variable
    length and sleeping between bursts. We dynamically figure out the length in order
    to maintain a desirable active time below variable load. T-MAC end the active
    time in a spontaneous way. Show All B. Z-MAC Z-MAC in the setup phase runs the
    give below steps in sequence: discovery of neighbour, assigning slots, local frame
    exchange followed by global time synchronization. Show All During the phase of
    setup these sequence run only once and will not run till there is a important
    change in the topology of network (like the physical relocation of sensors) occurs.
    The ZMAC idea is to start direct costs for functioning these operations that are
    atoned by improved output and energy efficiency during transmission of data. Graph
    1. Delay comparison on nodes using Z-MAC Show All The graph depicts that sensor
    nodes using effective medium access control protocol such a Z-MAC has an efficient
    result on delay reduction of working in clusters as comparing to the sensor nodes
    in the clusters without any medium access control protocol. The green line in
    the graph represents the lower delay product that used Z_MAC in clusters and the
    red line represents the non usage of medium access control protocol that depicts
    a high delay on communication between the nodes. Graph 2. Throughput depiction
    on sensor nodes. Show All The graph represents the throughput of sensor nodes
    operation which is a main factor of consideration in any communication channel.
    The green line in the graph represents a higher level of throughput as a result
    of Z-MAC implementation and the red line depicts a lower throughput level as a
    result of absence of medium access control protocol. SECTION VI. Conclusion In
    this work we have studied about the cluster formation and the issues which were
    faced in the earlier system. Wireless Sensor Networks are energy constrained networks.
    Since most of the energy is consumed for the transmission and reception of data,
    the process of data assembling and applying Z-Mac concept becomes a turning point
    here. The Sensors can be deployed in a thick Linear fashion and monitoring the
    environment like weather, moisture content of soil, temperature of soil, fertility
    of soil, weed-disease detection, monitoring crop growth, precision agriculture
    and automatic irrigation facility in an energy conservative way the Z-Mac concepts
    have been discussed. Also efficient data aggregation and Z-Mac provide energy
    conservation. This provides efficient transmission. CH is elected using EWCDS
    and ensures that energy does not drain using the Z-Mac concept. The simulation
    results shows that if any node has two hop distance in given CH range, that node
    proclaims that it is the route CH and it will collect the data from close by sensors
    and eventually it will hand over the data to the given sink, thus conserving the
    energy. The main aim of ZMAC concept is to reduce the energy consumption. Authors

    in precision agriculture. This paper proposes a novel approach based on sensor
    network technology to control the irrigation in agricultural field automatically.
    All sensor nodes deployed in the field, continuously sense soil temperature, soil
    moisture and air humidity of the agricultural field and transmit this information
    to base station only when the user defined periodic timer or sensed attributes
    values exceed desired threshold. In the proposed routing protocol, region-based

    and RBHR routing protocols. The analysis and experimental results show a significant
    decrement in data transmission rate due to user-defined transmission thresholds.
    The balanced use of fuzzy logic technique, static clustering and hybrid routing
    approach efficiently reduce energy consumption of sensor nodes in every data transmission
    round and prolongs the overall network lifetime by 173.16%, 149.22%, 99.49% and

    1. Introduction Over the recent years, wireless sensor network (WSN) technologies
    have a wide range of application domains such as military applications, precision
    agriculture, environmental monitoring, health-care applications, industry applications
    and time critical applications discussed in Zheng and Jamalipour (2009). For these
    applications, designing a reliable and energy-efficient communication protocol
    are the most important challenge. The energy consumption in transmitting data
    from source node to base station (BS) mainly affects the sensor network lifetime.
    A wireless sensor networks consists of hundred or thousands of battery-powered
    sensor nodes that are randomly deployed in a large geographical area. The deployed
    sensor nodes are able to collect large amounts of data/information and then communicate
    it to a central authority. Fig. 1 shows the architecture of WSN deployed for precision
    agriculture. The sensor nodes in the network communicate among themselves by using
    the RF (radio-frequency) links of ISM (Industrial, scientific, and medical) radio
    bands (such as 902–928 MHz and 2.4–2.5 GHz). Generally, a BS is also deployed
    in the network with the sensor nodes to make a connection between the WSN and
    outside world. Thus, the BS is equipped with both RF and GSM (Global System for
    Mobile communications) or GPRS (General Packet Radio Service). A remote user can
    monitor the field conditions, and control the actuator devices and sensor nodes.
    For example, a user can switch on/off a valve/pump when the water level applied
    to the field reaches to some predefined threshold value. Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 1. Wireless sensor network deployed for precision agriculture. The
    WSNs in agriculture domain may bring out the important contribution to precision
    agriculture. In precision agriculture, various parameters like environment temperature,
    soil type, moisture, humidity, air pressure, etc. vary rapidly from one region
    to another region and these parameters affect the quantity, cost and quality of
    production. Therefore, we need to design some decision based automatic tools or
    techniques for applying the right amount of input (water, fertilizers, pesticides,
    etc.) at the right time and at a right location to improve the production quality
    of crops, discussed in Awasthi and Reddy (2013). In the modern automatic irrigation
    system, the farmers do not need to continuously monitor the agriculture field
    to acquire information about the field. This monitoring can be done automatically
    by collecting the real-time data of soil, weather and air quality in a more accurate
    manner by using sensors. A predictive analysis is required to make smarter decision
    so that the irrigation can take place automatically only when there will be intense
    requirement of water. For this purpose, periodic threshold sensitive region-based
    hybrid routing protocol is proposed in this paper. The proposed protocol is an
    energy-efficient protocol in which monitoring of the field can be done automatically
    in a more efficient way by using sensors and the user defined thresholds help
    to save energy and time of farmers from continuous monitoring of field to find
    out a particular area where irrigation is required. The main objective of this
    paper is to provide an energy-efficient routing protocol for automated irrigation
    system. Therefore, we propose a novel fuzzy-based energy-efficient routing protocol
    for precision agriculture in this paper. Some key features of the proposed routing
    protocol are highlighted as follows: • The proposed protocol uses a region-based
    static clustering approach, for providing efficient coverage over the large geographical
    area where the entire network field is divided into fixed regions in such a way
    that each region contains different types of heterogeneous sensor nodes. • The
    periodic threshold sensitive hybrid routing is used for transmitting data to BS
    when the information about the field is required. For this purpose, user defined
    data transmission thresholds (i.e. rigid threshold, mild threshold and periodic
    timer) are used and once the environmental parameters value crosses the threshold
    limit, sensor nodes send data packets to BS. Therefore, these thresholds help
    to reduce the number of transmission to BS. • In the network, heterogeneous types
    of sensor nodes are considered where some nodes have less energy as compared to
    other nodes, send their data directly to the BS while other high energy nodes,
    use fuzzy based cluster head technique for transmitting their data to BS. This
    helps to minimize the energy consumption of sensor nodes in every data transmission
    period and improves the network lifetime. The rest of the paper is organized as
    follows: design issues and literature review have been discussed in Section 2,
    and Section 3 introduces proposed protocol in detail, a comparative study of simulation
    based results are presented in Section 4 and finally we provide conclusion and
    future work related to our proposed protocol in Section 5. 2. Design issues and
    literature review The major challenges of WSNs are to develop low-cost energy-efficient
    routing protocols with simple operation and high reliability. In recent years,
    wireless technologies have a growing interest in precision agriculture. Rawat
    et al. (2014) provides an exhaustive survey on recent developments and major challenges
    to facilitate the deployment of sensor network technology in real world scenario.
    Ojha et al. (2015) studied the current state of art in WSNs and their applicability
    in farming and precision agriculture applications. The authors analyzed the problems
    of the existing precision agriculture applications with detailed case studies
    for global as well as for the Indian scenarios. Sudha et al. (2011) provided various
    different data transmission methods based on TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access)
    scheduling for an automatic irrigation system. Different data aggregation methods
    were used in order to increase energy efficiency of the network. Zhou et al. (2009)
    designed a star-based intelligent system using ZigBee technology for the irrigation
    purpose. The micro-controller used in that system was supposed to be powered by
    the external power supply and sensor nodes were mostly in sleep mode. Kalaivani
    et al. (2011) provided an outline of distinct ZigBee-based WSNs used for the precision
    agriculture. They have identified various issues regarding ZigBee in agriculture
    domain; i.e. how the factors such as base station antenna height, node spacing,
    and density of leaves affect the signal strength. Nikolidakis et al. (2015) proposed
    a scheme based on the collaboration of an integrated system for automated irrigation
    management with an advanced novel routing protocol for WSNs. Li and Shen, 2013a,
    Li and Shen, 2013b presented energy-efficient WSN system for black-pepper crop
    monitoring in tropical areas. To provide reliable communication among the nodes,
    author optimized the BS antenna height. In the developed protocol, symmetrical
    double chain topology was used to improve the sensor network lifetime. The main
    drawback of this approach was that sensor nodes sent their data continuously to
    BS which used to consume lots of energy in data transmission. Vellidis et al.
    (2008) developed smart sensor array for measuring soil and air temperature for
    irrigation in cotton field. The designed system was able to reliably monitor soil
    water status. The authors did not pay attention towards the development of energy-efficient
    protocol. Morais et al. (2008) designed a ZigBee-based multi-powered wireless
    power management subsystem where sensor nodes battery was recharged with energy
    harvested from the surrounding environment. So, most of the routing protocols
    developed for precision agriculture are mainly concerned with the high reliability,
    and they do not consider to save the energy of a sensor node. The most of the
    routing protocols developed for precision agriculture also do not provide an efficient
    solution for the farmers, which enables to take necessary action when irrigation
    needs to be started in the field. One of the most important issues in WSNs is
    to develop an energy-efficient communication protocol. There are so many energy-efficient
    cluster based routing protocols such as ‘LEACH’ developed by Heinzelman et al.
    (2000), ‘TEEN’ by Manjeshwar and Agrawal (2001), ‘APTEEN’ by Manjeshwar and Agrawal
    (2002), ‘HEED’ by Younis and Fahmy (2004), ‘JCOCR’ by Ge et al. (2008), ‘CDMMP’
    by Li et al. (2008), ‘ELCH’ by Lotf et al. (2008), ‘EECFP’ by Allirani and Suganthi
    (2009), ‘DHAC’ by Lung and Zhou (2010), routing protocol by Wei and Zhang (2010),
    routing protocol by Wei et al. (2010), ‘DCD’ by Doddapaneni et al. (2014) and
    ‘ECHERP’ by Nikolidakis et al. (2015) exist in the literature but most of these
    routing protocols are not suitable for precision agriculture because it does not
    provide efficient coverage over the entire agricultural area. In these protocols,
    sensor nodes are deployed randomly over the entire network area, and if more sensor
    nodes are deployed far away from BS then there would be some areas left unattended
    in the field which creates a coverage hole in the network discussed in Zhu et
    al., 2012, Ammari and Das, 2012. Since for efficient irrigation in the field,
    users/farmers require information from each and every part of the field. Therefore,
    the routing protocol must provide efficient coverage over the entire agricultural
    field. For this, every part of the field must be covered (or sensed) by some sensor
    nodes. Most of these routing protocols do not ensure the proper utilization of
    node’s energy because the selection of a cluster head (CH) node was random or
    based on residual energy only. These protocols were developed to basically perform
    in homogeneous environment. But in real scenario, different applications demand
    heterogeneous sensor nodes for data acquisition. Some protocols such as ‘SEP’
    developed by Smaragdakis et al. (2004), ‘DEEC’ by Qing et al. (2006), ‘E-SEP’
    by Aderohunmu and Deng (2009), ‘EEHC’ by Kumar et al. (2009b), ‘EECHE’ by Kumar
    et al. (2009a), ‘DDEEC’ by Elbhiri et al. (2010), ‘EDFCM’ by Zhou et al. (2010),
    ‘EEERP’ by Khalil and Attea (2011) and ‘ERP’ by Bara and Khalil (2012) provide
    an efficient way to increase the reliability and network lifetime by using some
    heterogeneous sensor nodes in the network. But most of the energy-efficient heterogeneous
    routing protocols also suffer from the same problem. It does not guarantee efficient
    coverage over the entire network area and only residual energy is the primary
    concern for the selection of CH nodes. To provide efficient coverage over entire
    area, a Region-Based Hybrid Routing (RBHR) protocols have been proposed in Maurya
    and Daniel, 2014a, Maurya and Daniel, 2014b, Maurya and Daniel, 2015 for gathering
    and processing information from the whole network. In RBHR protocol, the outer
    regions are not fairly divided into equal area. The protocols are given with two
    level of heterogeneity of sensor nodes that continuously transmit a huge amount
    of data packets to BS which consumes lots of energy in continuous data transmission.
    3. Proposed protocol The detailed explanation and working principle of proposed
    protocol are discussed in this section. Energy efficiency is the most important
    issue when designing communication protocol for WSN where some applications (such
    as military applications, health-care applications and traffic management) demand
    continuous information from the network field; while some applications (such as
    precision agriculture and industrial applications) demand information from the
    network only when it is necessary. Therefore in this paper, an energy-efficient
    periodic threshold sensitive region-based hybrid routing protocol is proposed
    for the efficient irrigation in the agricultural field. The proposed protocol
    is the most suitable energy-efficient routing protocol for precision agriculture.
    3.1. Assumptions Before going into the details of proposed protocol some assumptions
    about the network are made as: • Network architecture uses region-based static
    clustering throughout the network lifetime. • In the network, all the sensor nodes
    and BS are stationary after deployment. • BS is located at the center and has
    no energy constraints. • BS is within the range of each sensor node. • All the
    sensor nodes are aware of their own locations. The location of the nodes can be
    achieved by satellite based GPS system (Global Positioning System) or by using
    any energy-efficient localization techniques for WSNs proposed in the literature
    Niculescu, 2004, Gopakumar and Jacob, 2008, etc. • Three types of heterogeneous
    sensor nodes are considered for sensing and transmitting data to BS. 3.2. System
    composition In this paper, a well-suited network model is considered for precision
    agriculture. The proposed model uses threshold sensitive hybrid routing approach
    to measure three environment parameters essential for irrigation; first is the
    soil temperature, second one is the soil moisture content of the field and third
    is the air humidity which are important for the efficient irrigation. According
    to the temperature, moisture and humidity value of the agricultural field, an
    automatic decision can be taken as when irrigation needs to be started which enables
    the farmers to increase yields and the quality of crops by maintaining proper
    water in the field during critical plant growth stages. The basic scenario of
    the sensor network consists of a sensor node and base station. • Sensor node:
    Three types of heterogeneous sensor nodes as Type-1, Type-2 and Type-3 nodes are
    considered in the network for sensing and transmitting information to BS. In a
    heterogeneous sensor network, two or more different types of nodes with different
    functionality in terms of sensing, storage, computation, communication and energy
    capacity are used as discussed in Mhatre and Rosenberg, 2004, Kumar et al., 2009b.
    In the proposed protocol, each different types of sensor nodes in the network
    (i.e. Type-1, Type-2 and Type-3 nodes) consists of a soil temperature sensor,
    a soil moisture sensor and air humidity sensor. Fig. 2 shows the block diagram
    of a sensor node. The sensor nodes are deployed for sensing and transmitting the
    soil temperature, soil moisture and air humidity information of the agricultural
    field to a BS. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Sensor node. • Base
    station: The base station (BS) consists of a transceiver, processor, and LCD display.
    BS collects the information about the temperature, moisture and humidity value
    of the field so that an end user can take a necessary action by analyzing these
    informations. Since the high energy sensor node costs higher, so in the network
    we have considered three types of sensor nodes in different-different numbers
    (as used in EEHC protocol). In the proposed protocol, the energy level, sensing
    range and transmitting range for each Type-1, Type-2 and Type-3 sensor nodes are
    different. We have considered that the higher energy sensor nodes have higher
    sensing and transmitting range. Generally, the radio transmission range is at
    least twice the sensing range as discussed in Zhang and Hou (2005). Type-1 node’s
    energy < Type-2 node’s energy < Type-3 node’s energy. Type-1 sensing range < Type-2
    sensing range < Type-3 sensing range. Type-1 node’s transmission range < Type-2
    node’s transmission range < Type-3 node’s transmission range. 3.3. Region-based
    node deployment The benefits of using region based static clustering are discussed
    in Maurya and Daniel (2014b). We have considered ( ) agricultural field where
    BS is located at the center position of the field. In the network, three types
    of heterogeneous sensor nodes are deployed for sensing and transmitting the information
    about soil temperature, soil moisture and humidity of the agricultural field.
    To overcome the coverage hole problem and for providing efficient coverage to
    the entire agricultural field, region-based static clustering is used where the
    total area is divided into nine fixed regions as shown in Fig. 3. Here we are
    considering the specific land area, so the division of all the regions can be
    easily specified through field measurement. The region division can be done on
    the basis of the available number of different types of sensor nodes in the network
    and their range of sensing. Since we have assumed that BS is located at the center
    then corner’s area should be fairly divided. So, the outermost and middle region’s
    area is equally divided among four-four regions (i.e. REG-1, REG-2, REG-3 and
    REG-4 regions have equal area for outermost region and REG-5, REG-6, REG-7 and
    REG-8 regions have equal area for middle region). Thus, available number of Type-2
    and Type-3 nodes are also equally divided. In case of non-uniform distribution
    of Type-2 and Type-3 nodes, overhead on a CH node of a particular outer/middle
    region which has more number of Type-2/Type-3 nodes may increase as compared to
    other outer/middle region’s CH node. The more a node is far from BS, the more
    it will consume energy in data transmission. It means the outermost region’s (REG-1,
    REG-2, REG-3 and REG-4) nodes that are very far from BS need more energy to transmit
    data to BS as compared to middle region’s (REG-5, REG-6, REG-7 and REG-8) nodes
    and innermost region’s (REG-9) nodes. Therefore, Type-3 nodes having more energy
    than Type-1 and Type-2 nodes should be placed in outermost regions, Type-2 nodes
    having energy less than Type-3 nodes but greater than Type-1 nodes should be placed
    in middle regions and finally the Type-1 nodes having very less energy should
    be deployed in innermost region. But, in the proposed network model, we have deployed
    Type-3 nodes in the middle regions, Type-2 nodes in the outermost regions and
    Type-1 nodes in the innermost region. The reason why we have deployed in this
    manner is clearly explained in next Section 3.4. The region-based node deployment
    algorithm for proposed protocol is given in Algorithm 1. Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 3. Region-based node deployment. In Algorithm 1, n is the total number
    of sensor nodes (all types) in the entire network, is the total number of Type-2
    nodes in the network and is the total number of Type-3 nodes in the network. All
    these sensor nodes are deployed over the agricultural area. The Type-1, Type-2
    and Type-3 nodes are uniformly deployed in their respective regions. According
    to the deployment of the sensor nodes, a WSN may be classified into the deterministic
    or non-deterministic sensor network. In a deterministic network, the locations/positions
    of the sensor nodes are preplanned and static after the deployment. This type
    of sensor network may be used where the preplanned deployment of the nodes are
    possible. But, in most of the situations, such as in harsh or hostile environments
    the deployment of nodes in a preplanned manner is difficult. Therefore, the nodes
    are randomly deployed over the field without pre-planning and engineering. Obviously,
    the non-deterministic sensor networks are more flexible and scalable, but it requires
    higher control complexity discussed in Zheng and Jamalipour (2009). For very large
    agricultural field where preplanned deployment is difficult, the nodes can be
    randomly deployed over the field. Algorithm 1 Region-based node deployment algorithm

    threshold-sensitive hybrid routing The proposed protocol is threshold sensitive
    protocol because nodes sense the environment parameters continuously but data
    transmission occurs only when the sensed value is in the range of interest. This
    helps the farmers/end users to take decision about irrigation. But, there is a
    limitation of threshold sensitivity, if the sensed value does not reach to set
    thresholds, nodes will never send any information to BS and the farmer will not
    come to know about the field conditions. So, we have proposed a periodic data
    transmission scheme in which data must be transmitted after a fixed time interval.
    In this case, the BS will receive information about field condition after every
    fixed time interval either the sensed value crosses threshold or not. Hence, the
    data transmission will not depend only upon the threshold limits, but it will
    also depend on the periodic timer. The periodic threshold sensitive hybrid routing
    algorithm is given in Algorithm 2. The benefits of using hybrid routing approach
    for data transmission is discussed in Maurya and Daniel (2015). In the proposed
    protocol, all the Type-1 nodes deployed in REG-9 (i.e. Region-9) transmit their
    data directly to BS whereas Type-3 and Type-2 nodes deployed in middle and outermost
    regions respectively transmit their data via the CH node as shown in Fig. 4. If
    we allow Type-1 nodes to become CH, they will die soon because of energy dissipation
    in data aggregation is more as compared to direct data transmission. If Type-2
    or Type-3 nodes which are within the range of the BS but very far from BS and
    send its data directly to BS, then node will consume more energy in direct data
    transmission because the node will have to transmit a data packet with high transmission
    power given in Heinzelman et al. (2000). So, to save the energy of Type-2 and
    Type-3 nodes, clustering technique is used for Type-2 and Type-3 nodes only. This
    leads to the overall improvement in network lifetime. In the proposed protocol,
    Type-3 nodes having highest energy are deployed in middle regions instead of outermost
    regions because they have to perform additional data aggregation task from outermost
    region’s CH node as well as have to perform data aggregation from its own members.
    If we deploy Type-2 nodes in middle regions instead of Type-3 nodes then definitely
    all the Type-2 nodes will die soon as compared to Type-3 nodes because Type-2
    nodes have less amount of energy as well as they have to perform additional data
    aggregation task. After the death of all Type-2 nodes, a coverage hole in the
    middle regions will get created. And due to coverage hole in middle regions the
    sensor nodes in outermost regions will not be able to communicate with BS in spite
    of being alive. Therefore, coverage hole in outermost regions also get created.
    So, to get rid of coverage hole problem Type-3 nodes are deployed in middle regions.
    The proposed protocol considers four modes of single-hop communication: (i) Communication
    between CH and CM (cluster member). (ii) Communication between outermost region’s
    CH node and middle region’s CH node. (iii) Communication between middle region’s
    CH node and BS. (iv) Communication between Type-1 nodes and BS. Algorithm 2 Threshold-sensitive

    In the proposed protocol, only one CH node is selected from each outermost and
    middle region. Therefore, for data transmission total eight CHs are selected in
    every round as shown in Fig. 4. The number of CH nodes within a region can be
    decided according to the availability of Type-2 and Type-3 nodes. In the network,
    if there are more number of CHs then it consumes more energy in data aggregation
    because a node requires more energy in data aggregation as compared to sensing
    and transmitting a data packet to BS (see Table 3). Therefore, the selection of
    number of CH nodes in each cluster should ensure proper load balancing in each
    outer/middle region. In the proposed protocol, since the number of Type-2 and
    Type-3 nodes in a particular outer and middle region respectively are very less
    as compared to innermost region’s nodes, so to save the data aggregation energy
    of a CH node, we have chosen only one CH from each outer and middle region. Once
    the CH is decided in a particular round, other CM nodes send their data to its
    own CH node (as shown in Fig. 4) and then after aggregation, a CH node forward
    the data to lower layer CH/BS. Three data transmission thresholds used in this
    paper are defined as follows: • Rigid threshold ( ): This is the threshold value
    for sensed attributes beyond which the nodes sensing this value must transmit
    data to BS. • Mild threshold ( ): This is the threshold value for small change
    in the sensed attributes which triggers the sensor nodes to transmit data to BS.
    • Periodic timer ( ): Inter-arrival time between two successive data transmission
    to BS. The rigid threshold ( ), mild threshold ( ) and periodic timer ( ) can
    be modified by end user at any time according to crop water needs during the sensing
    process. These thresholds are mainly used for transmitting information to BS and
    it can be chosen based on the weather conditions and the requirement of water
    for a particular crop which is different for different crops. When there is a
    need for changing these thresholds value as per the requirement of water for a
    particular crop then the BS broadcasts these thresholds in the network. Therefore,
    the user can set these thresholds according to the need of irrigation in the agriculture
    field. The crop water needs discussed in FAO (1986) mainly depends on: • Crop
    type: crops like sugarcane or maize need more water than the crops like sorghum
    or millet. • Climate: in a hot and sunny climate, crops need more water per day
    than in a cool and cloudy climate. • Growth stage of the crop: fully grown crops
    need more water than the crops that have just been planted. The sensed values
    of temperature, moisture and humidity are stored in an internal variable called
    sensed temperature value (STV), sensed moisture value (SMV) and sensed humidity
    value (SHV). All the sensor nodes will transmit data in current round, only when
    either of the following conditions are satisfied: (i) The current temperature
    value (CTV) is greater than or equal to Rigid Threshold or current moisture value
    (CMV)/current humidity value (CHV) is less than or equal to the Rigid Threshold
    / respectively. (ii) The absolute difference value (CTV-STV) or (CMV-SMV) or (CHV-SHV)
    are greater than or equal to Mild Threshold or or respectively. (iii) Periodic
    Timer ( ) expires. In every round, CTV, CHV and CMV will sense by each sensor
    nodes. Whenever a node transmits data, CTV, CMV and CHV are set to sensed temperature
    value (STV), sensed moisture value (SMV) and sensed humidity value (SHV) respectively.
    3.5. Efficient cluster head selection using fuzzy logic Initially, the BS broadcasts
    a TDMA schedule and requests all the sensor nodes to advertise themselves. Then
    all the nodes transmit their IDs, initial energy and location information to BS.
    After that the BS selects the best CH node from each middle and outermost regions
    using fuzzy logic then BS broadcasts the IDs and location information of the new
    CHs and the user defined data transmission thresholds (i.e. rigid threshold, mild
    threshold, periodic timer). All the sensor nodes in the network store this information
    in their internal memory. In this paper, we have assumed that BS is within the
    range of each sensor node, so that nodes can transmit information about the field
    conditions and its own initial information (i.e. IDs, initial energy and location
    information) to BS via single-hop communication (as shown in Fig. 4). But, in
    the case of very large field, where BS is very far from the CH node then the CH
    node can communicate to BS via multi-hop communication by selecting multiple optimum
    CHs in each region. In the network, each node will try to find nearest neighbor
    CH node towards the BS to send their sensed data. If the CH node is within the
    range of a source node, then the source node will transmit data to the CH node
    directly otherwise the source node will transmit data by selecting highest energy
    sensor node towards the BS. The same approach will be applied for communication
    between outer region’s CH node and middle region’s CH node. This multi-hop communication
    approach will also minimize the energy consumption of the network as single-hop
    communication approach. But as per the assumptions, this work consider only four
    modes of single-hop communication as discussed in Section 3.4. The fuzzy logic
    technique is used to improve proper balancing of energy dissipation among the
    Type-2 nodes and Type-3 nodes. In every round, BS considers two parameters for
    CH selection such as; node’s distance from BS (for selecting CH node from middle
    regions)/node’s distance from CH (for selecting CH node from outermost regions)
    and residual energy of each node. In a particular round, as soon as the BS found
    better candidate for the CH node selection than the previously selected CH, then
    BS broadcasts the IDs and location information of newly selected CH node. The
    two input functions, distance and residual energy of a sensor node are transformed
    into fuzzy sets P and Q respectively defined as follows: where P and Q are defined
    as a universe of discourse for ‘Distance from BS/Distance from CH’ and for ‘Residual
    Energy’ of a sensor node respectively. and are membership functions for distance
    and residual energy input variable respectively. (dist) and (ene) are the particular
    element of set P and Q respectively. The first-order radio energy model for 3-level
    heterogeneous wireless sensor network described in Kumar et al. (2009b) is used
    for calculating energy dissipation of each CH and CM node. The energy dissipated
    in a CH node during a particular round is calculated as: (1) where N is the packet
    size and is the per bit energy dissipation in running the transmitter or receiver
    circuit of a sensor device. is the energy consumed by the amplifier to transmit
    over a shorter distance, is the energy consumed by the amplifier to transmit at
    a longer distance and . is the data aggregation energy and is the average distance
    between a CH node and BS. The energy dissipated by CM node during a particular
    round is equal to: (2) where is the average distance between a CM node and its
    CH node. The total initial energy of entire heterogeneous network (E) is defined
    in Eq. (3). (3) where is the initial energy of Type-1 nodes. In the network, and
    are the energy factor i.e. Type-3 nodes have times more energy than Type-1 nodes,
    and Type-2 nodes have times more energy than Type-1 node. The value for all the
    other variables defined in Eq. (3) are given in Table 3. Now, the degree of membership
    based on the “Node’s distance from BS” in case of Type-3 node or “Node’s distance
    from CH” node in case of Type-2 node is calculated as: The degree of membership
    based on the “Residual Energy” of each Type-2 and Type-3 node is calculated as:
    where  = Minimum threshold for distance-from-BS/distance-from-CH parameter.  =
    Maximum threshold for distance-from-BS/distance-from-CH parameter.  = Minimum
    threshold for residual energy variable.  = Maximum threshold for residual energy
    variable. These , and thresholds are used for CHs selection among Type-2 nodes
    and among Type-3 nodes. After calculating degree of membership, AND ( ) fuzzy
    operator is used to find the fuzzy relation between membership parameters as,
    Graphical representation of a membership function based on the node distance from
    BS/distance from CH is shown in Fig. 5 and graphical representation of a membership
    function based on residual energy is shown in Fig. 6. Download : Download full-size

    3.5.1. Rule evaluation for efficient cluster head selection The process of CHs
    selection is according to the precedence order of distance and residual energy
    of each Type-2 and Type-3 node. Table 1 shows three fuzzy membership functions
    for each input parameters (i.e. ‘Near’, ‘Considerable’ and ‘Far’ for distance
    parameter and ‘Low’, ‘Medium’ and ‘High’ for energy parameter). Table 2 defines
    all the possible combinations of different membership functions for the three
    input variables that result in nine logical rules for the fuzzy inference system.
    For example, if a node is ‘Near’ to BS and has ‘High’ energy then for CH selection,
    the node will have highest priority (i.e. ) as well as if a node is ‘Far’ from
    BS and also has ‘Low’ energy then for CH selection, the node will have lowest
    priority (i.e. ). Therefore, a Type-2 and Type-3 node having highest priority
    (defined in Table 2) among other nodes will be selected as a CH node from each
    outer and middle region. The priority order for CH selection is defined as follows:
    Table 1. Input function. Input parameters Input membership function Distance-from-BS/CH
    Near Considerable Far Residual energy Low Medium High Table 2. Logical rule sets.
    Distance-from-BS/CH Residual energy Priority Near Low Near Medium Near High Considerable
    Low Considerable Medium Considerable High Far Low Far Medium Far High In case
    of priority tie, the precedence order for selecting a CH node is: Distance-from-BS/distance-from-CH   Residual
    energy. 3.6. Operation flowchart for proposed protocol The operation flowchart
    for the proposed routing protocol is given in Fig. 7. After the region-wise sensor
    node deployment, each node senses the environmental parameter continuously if
    a node is alive. Alive Type-1 nodes send the data packets directly to BS if, sensed
    parameter values cross the user defined data transmission thresholds and alive
    Type-2/Type-3 nodes send the data packets via CH node if, sensed parameter values
    cross the data transmission thresholds. This process repeats until the death of
    last alive sensor node. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 7. Operation
    flowchart for proposed protocol. 4. Performance analysis We have simulated a heterogeneous
    clustered WSN model with area dimensions ( ) using MATLAB. The total 100 (n) sensor
    nodes (all types) are deployed in network area. The entire network area is divided
    into nine fixed regions and three types of heterogeneous sensor nodes are deployed
    in these nine regions according to Algorithm 1. The placement/deployment of sensor
    nodes in the agricultural applications such as for irrigation depends on the sensing
    range of the sensors such that each and every part of the agriculture field must
    be covered (or sensed) by some sensor nodes. The optimum number of the sensor
    nodes for maintaining coverage and connectivity in the network can be calculated
    on the basis of the sensing range of the sensor node which is discussed in Zhang
    and Hou (2005). Therefore, by providing efficient coverage to entire agricultural
    field, user can decide in which area, irrigation is required. Since, the three
    types of sensor nodes have different energy level and sensing range, so we have
    deployed Type-1, Type-2 and Type-3 sensor nodes in different-different numbers.
    For example, in region-9, since we are deploying Type-1 sensor nodes which have
    lowest energy level and sensing range, so to cover entire region-9, we have to
    deploy more numbers of Type-1 sensor nodes as compared to other region’s sensor
    nodes. For simplicity and simulation purpose, we have deployed of n as Type-2
    nodes ( ), of as Type-3 nodes ( ) and rest as Type-1 nodes. These Type-2 and Type-3
    nodes are equally and uniformly distributed in each outer and middle regions respectively.
    The Type-2 nodes distance (dist) from lower layer CH node (i.e. CH node selected
    from middle regions) must lie between 20 m and 72.1 m and Type-3 nodes distance
    (dist) from BS must lie between 10 m and 42.43 m as shown in Fig. 8. The residual
    energy (ene) of Type-1, Type-2 and Type-3 nodes must lie between 0–0.3 J, 0–0.6
    J and 0–0.9 J respectively. For the experiment purpose, soil temperature of the
    field is varying from to , soil moisture content of the field is ranging between
    0% and 100% and air humidity of the field is varying from 0% to 100%. Download

    variable in case of Type-3 and Type-2 nodes respectively. Table 3 discusses other
    simulation parameters used for data transmission and CHs selection. The value
    of rigid and mild threshold for soil temperature (i.e. and respectively) are considered
    for a maize crop. Maize requires abundant sunlight for optimum yields. The optimum
    temperature for the growth and development of maize crop is – ; temperature above
    reduce yields which is discussed in Brink et al. (2006). Therefore, we have chosen
    rigid threshold ( ) and mild threshold ( ) for soil temperature as and respectively
    which means as soon as the node senses greater than or equal to value a data packet
    containing this information will be sent to BS. Also, if there is a change as
    compared to previously sensed temperature value a data packet containing this
    information will be sent to BS. Similarly, for simulation purpose we have chosen
    the rigid and mild threshold for soil moisture content (i.e. and respectively)
    and rigid and mild threshold for air humidity (i.e. and respectively). These thresholds
    value can be set by the users according to the need of irrigation in the agriculture
    field for a particular crop. The periodic timer ( ) parameter value of 5 s specifies
    here that data transmission will occur in every 5th round if sensed parameter
    values do not cross the desired thresholds. Table 3. Simulation parameters. Parameters

    the network. (ii) Network lifetime: is the time duration from start of network
    operation to the death of last alive node in the network. (iii) Throughput: is
    the total number of data packets sent to the BS during entire network lifetime.
    (iv) Residual energy: is the overall remaining energy that a node has after a
    particular round. 4.1. Simulation results In this subsection, comparative study
    of the behavior of proposed protocol with EEHC, DEEC, DDEEC and RBHR protocol
    are discussed. In the Section 3.4, we have clearly explained that why we should
    deploy Type-3 nodes in middle regions instead of Type-2 nodes. In addition to
    explanation, the fidelity of the deployment is shown by simulation results. In
    Table 4, Table 5, proposed protocol is compared with EEHC, DEEC, DDEEC and RBHR
    protocol in terms of energy consumption, network lifetime and number of packets
    transmitted to BS. For the comparison, we have simulated the DEEC, DDEEC and RBHR
    protocol with 3-levels of heterogeneity. Table 4 and Fig. 9 show comparison results
    with other protocols when Type-2 nodes deployed in middle regions and Table 5
    and Fig. 10 show comparison results with other protocols when Type-3 nodes deployed
    in middle regions for RBHR and proposed protocol. Fig. 11, Fig. 12, Fig. 13 show
    the network lifetime in case of different periodic timer ( ), different mild threshold
    for soil temperature ( ) and different rigid threshold for soil temperature (
    ) value respectively. Instead of these three simulation parameters, all the other
    parameters are same as defined in Table 3. Table 4. Protocols comparison in case

    . 4.2. Results analysis This subsection, comparatively analyze our proposed protocol
    in comparison to other existing routing protocols such as EEHC, DEEC, DDEEC and
    RBHR protocol. Figs. 9a and 10a show the network lifetime of EEHC, DEEC, DDEEC,
    RBHR and proposed protocol as per the simulation parameter defined in Table 3.
    In EEHC protocol, all the three types of sensor nodes are deployed randomly over
    the entire network area and also the CH nodes are selected randomly in every round.
    Therefore, it is possible that a node which is far away from BS and also having
    less energy may be selected as a CH node. In such a situation, nodes will die
    very quickly and the network lifetime of EEHC protocol will be very short. Due
    to the random deployment of nodes, it does not provide efficient coverage to entire
    agricultural field. The DEEC and DDEEC protocols are developed to perform in a
    heterogeneous environment. In both DEEC and DDEEC protocol, the nodes are deployed
    randomly over the entire network area. Therefore, they also do not guarantee efficient
    coverage which is highly desirable for efficient irrigation in the field. In DEEC
    protocol, CHs are selected in every round by calculating a probability, based
    on the ratio between the residual energy and average energy of the network. Due
    to the consideration of residual energy for CH selection, the lifetime of the
    network in case of DEEC protocol is increased as compared to EEHC protocol. The
    DDEEC protocol is based on DEEC protocol, where all the sensor nodes use the residual
    and initial energy level to select the CH nodes. In DEEC protocol, the higher
    energy sensor nodes penalize, specially when their residual energy deplete and
    become in the range of the lower energy sensor nodes. In this situation, the higher
    energy sensor nodes die quickly than the others nodes in the network. But in DDEEC
    protocol, the higher energy nodes are preferred to be selected as a CH node for
    the initial transmission rounds, and when their energy decreases sensibly, these
    nodes will have the equal CH selection probability like the lower energy nodes.
    This prolongs the overall network lifetime of DDEEC protocol as compared to both
    the EEHC and DEEC protocol. The RBHR protocol provides efficient coverage over
    large geographical area. Due to the deployment of nodes in respective regions
    according to their energy level (i.e. as per the literature, higher energy nodes
    are deployed far away from BS such as Type-1 in innermost region, Type-2 in middle
    regions and Type-3 in outermost regions) and hybrid routing scheme, RBHR enhances
    the network lifetime as compared to other EEHC, DEEC, and DDEEC routing protocols.
    Although, the RBHR is an energy-efficient routing protocol and provides efficient
    coverage but it is not suitable for the precision irrigation because the protocol
    is applicable where continuous data transmission to BS is required (e.g. in military
    applications, health-care applications, etc.). Therefore, for efficient irrigation
    in the field where continuous information about the field is not required, a novel
    periodic threshold sensitive hybrid routing protocol is proposed in this paper.
    The three data transmission thresholds (i.e. rigid, mild and periodic timer) are
    used for transmitting field information to the BS. The data packets are transmitted
    to BS only when the rigid threshold or mild threshold or periodic timer crosses
    the set value. For providing efficient coverage over entire network area modified
    region-based static clustering approach is proposed where nodes are deployed in
    respective regions according to their performing task & energy level both (i.e.
    Type-1 in innermost regions, Type-2 in outermost regions and Type-3 in middle
    regions). Due to balanced deployment of nodes, enhanced hybrid routing scheme
    (discussed in 3.4) and the best CH node selection by considering both the residual
    energy as well as distance parameter using fuzzy logic technique, lifetime of
    the network is increased as compared to RBHR protocol. The simulation results
    also verify that the proposed protocol prolongs the network lifetime over the
    EEHC, DEEC, DDEEC and RBHR protocol. All the sensor nodes are dead after 2884,
    3161, 3949, 5345 and 7878 rounds in case of EEHC, DEEC, DDEEC, RBHR and proposed
    protocol respectively as shown in Fig. 10a. Fig. 9, Fig. 10c show the total number
    of data packets received at the base station till current round. As per our simulation
    result shown in Fig. 10c, in case of EEHC protocol, total number of data packets
    received at BS (i.e. total 6108 data packets) is comparatively very less as compared
    to all the other protocols due to its shorter network lifetime. As the network
    lifetime of both the DEEC and DDEEC protocol is increases in comparison to EEHC,
    the total number of data packets received at BS also increases (i.e. total 120,872
    and 137,625 data packets, in case of DEEC and DDEEC respectively). The total number
    of data packets received at BS in case of RBHR is decreased (i.e. total 102,130
    data packets) due to only four CH node selection from outer regions. This restricts
    the transmission rate towards the BS as compared to EEHC, DEEC, and DDEEC. The
    packet transmission rate towards BS in case of our proposed protocol is decreased
    (i.e. total 63,090 data packets), as compared to DEEC, DDEEC and RBHR protocol
    due to user defined data transmission thresholds because data packets are received
    at BS only when nodes cross the data transmission thresholds (either rigid or
    mild or periodic timer), but it increased as compared to EEHC protocol due to
    overall improvement in sensor network lifetime. Fig. 9, Fig. 10b show the number
    of dead Type-1 nodes till current round. The number of dead Type-1 nodes in case
    of proposed protocol are less as compared to other routing protocols over the
    same number of rounds because the Type-1 nodes having less energy as compared
    to Type-2 and Type-3 nodes are deployed near the BS region (i.e. in REG-9), while
    in case of other (i.e. in EEHC, DEEC and DDEEC) routing protocols, Type-1 nodes
    are deployed over the entire network area which consumes more energy in long-distance
    communications. Fig. 9, Fig. 10d show the number of dead Type-2 nodes till current
    round. The number of dead Type-2 nodes in case of proposed protocol are less as
    compared to EEHC, DEEC and DDEEC protocols due to same reason as discussed for
    the Type-1 nodes. In Fig. 9, Fig. 10d, we can see that when Type-2 nodes are deployed
    in middle region then all the Type-2 nodes have died earlier (i.e. all Type-2
    nodes dead after 3707 rounds) as compared to Type-2 nodes deployed in outermost
    regions (i.e. all Type-2 nodes dead after 4889 rounds) because Type-2 nodes have
    less amount of energy as compared to Type-3 nodes as well as they have to perform
    additional data aggregation task from outermost region’s CH node as well as data
    aggregation task from its own CMs. Fig. 9, Fig. 10f show the number of dead Type-3
    nodes till current round. In Fig. 9, Fig. 10f, we can see that the when Type-3
    nodes are deployed in outermost region then 50% Type-3 nodes are dead after 4437
    rounds as compared to Type-3 nodes deployed in middle regions (i.e. 50% Type-3
    node dead after 2598 rounds) because the Type-3 nodes are the highest energy sensor
    nodes in the network as well as they have to perform data aggregation task from
    its own CM nodes only. Fig. 9, Fig. 10g show the number of dead sensor nodes after
    1000, 2000 & 3000 rounds. The total initial energy of the network is given in
    Eq. (3). Fig. 9, Fig. 10e show overall residual energy of the network after 2000,
    2500 & 3000 rounds and these figures show that in case of our proposed protocol,
    the average energy consumption of each sensor nodes are reduced in every round
    as compared to other routing protocols. In case of Type-2 nodes deployed in middle
    region, after the 3000 round, overall 69 sensor nodes are alive as compared to
    Type-3 nodes deployed in middle regions (only 65 sensor nodes are alive) because
    alive Type-3 nodes are only sensing the environment parameter but not communicating
    with BS as most of the Type-2 nodes are dead. Therefore, more nodes are alive
    after 3000 round because node consumes less energy in sensing than that for communication.
    We have also simulated and analyzed the performance of our proposed protocol with
    the various combination of data transmission thresholds shown in Fig. 11, Fig.
    12, Fig. 13 (in case of Type-3 nodes deployed in middle regions). Table 6 shows
    the corresponding round in which all sensor nodes are dead (i.e. Network lifetime)
    in case of our proposed protocol as per the simulation results provided in Fig.
    11, Fig. 12, Fig. 13. In Table 6, we can see that as the value of periodic timer
    ( ) decreases, the lifetime of the network also decreases. When , all the sensor
    nodes are dead after 5532 rounds as compared to when (nodes dead after 7878 rounds)
    and (nodes dead after 9148 rounds) because the nodes are transmitting data packets
    to BS after every 1 s if rigid or mild threshold do not reach to desired threshold.
    The nodes consume more energy when it transmits data packet to BS after every
    1 s as compared to when and . Also in such a situation, when nodes are transmitting
    data packets after every 1 s (that means in every round) it behaves similar to
    RBHR protocol. The proposed protocol fairly divides the outermost and middle regions,
    and equally distributes the nodes in these regions, in contrast to RBHR protocol.
    Therefore, as per Table 6, Table 5, the network lifetime (i.e. all sensor nodes
    dead after 5532 rounds at ) of the proposed protocol increases in comparison to
    RBHR protocol where all nodes are dead after 5345 rounds. Table 6. Network lifetime
    in case of different and . Thresholds Thresholds Round after all sensor nodes
    are dead and  = 8 s 9148  = 5 s 7878  = 1 s 5532  and  = 5 s 8213 7878 4820  and  =
    5 s 8025 7878 4768 Similarly, as the value of mild threshold for soil temperature
    ( ) decreases, the lifetime of the network also decreases. When , all the sensor
    nodes are dead after 4820 rounds as compared to when (nodes dead after 7878 rounds)
    and (nodes dead after 8213 rounds) because the nodes are transmitting data packets
    to BS more frequently. The nodes will transmit data packets more when it senses
    a temperature difference of than previously sensed temperature value. Similarly,
    as the value of rigid threshold for soil temperature ( ) decreases, the lifetime
    of the network also decreases. When , all the sensor nodes are dead after 4768
    rounds as compared to when (nodes dead after 7878 rounds) and (nodes dead after
    8025 rounds) because the nodes are transmitting data packets to BS more frequently.
    The simulation results show that the proposed protocol gives better result in
    most of the cases with various combinations of data transmission thresholds in
    comparison to other existing protocols. Therefore, we can say that the proposed
    protocol is an energy-efficient routing protocol which is applicable for agriculture
    domain. Also, in this subsection, to test the performance of proposed node deployment
    concept of Type-3 nodes in middle regions, we have analyzed it in two different
    cases. • Case-1: in which Type-2 nodes are deployed in middle region and corresponding
    results are presented in Table 4. • Case-2: in which Type-3 nodes are deployed
    in middle region and corresponding results are presented in Table 5. In Table
    4, we can see that in case of our proposed protocol, all the sensor nodes have
    died after 7094 rounds and Table 5 show that all the sensor nodes have died after
    7878 rounds. Also, in Case-1, all Type-2 sensor nodes have died after 3707 rounds
    but in the Case-2, all Type-2 sensor nodes have died after 4889 rounds. In Case-1,
    after the death of all Type-2 nodes, Type-3 nodes will sense only but never communicate
    with the BS. In this situation, a coverage hole is created in both the middle
    and outermost regions because Type-2 nodes are deployed in middle regions. After
    the death of all Type-2 nodes, only Type-1 nodes will communicate with BS until
    the death of last alive Type-1 node, if any. Therefore, according to Table 4 after
    the death of all the Type-1 nodes in 4037 rounds, logically the BS does not receive
    any information about the field while Type-3 nodes are still alive. Therefore,
    in case-1, BS is receiving information about the field till 4037 rounds. But in
    Case-2, after the death of all Type-2 nodes in 4889 rounds, Type-3 nodes will
    communicate with BS. In such a situation coverage hole is created in outermost
    regions only. Some Type-3 nodes will guaranteed be alive after the death of all
    Type-2 nodes because they are high energy nodes and deployed near the BS as compared
    to Type-2 nodes. According to Table 5, after the death of all Type-2 nodes some
    Type-1 and Type-3 nodes are still alive and communicating with BS. In this case,
    BS is receiving information about the field till 7878 rounds (all the Type-3 nodes
    are dead after 7878 rounds). Hence, the deployment of Type-3 nodes in middle regions
    is efficient and we achieve longer network lifetime because the BS is receiving
    information till 7878 rounds. 5. Conclusions and future work In this proposed
    threshold sensitive region-based hybrid routing protocol, the deployment of heterogeneous
    sensor nodes within fairly divided fixed regions, ensures proper coverage of entire
    network field. The Type-2 and Type-3 nodes die slower than Type-1 nodes due to
    balanced deployment of heterogeneous nodes in different regions. The dynamic clustering
    routing protocols such as LEACH, SEP, E-SEP, EEHC, DEEC and DDEEC use the weighted
    random probability for the selection of CHs node, which does not ensure the proper
    utilization of node’s energy in every data transmission period. Therefore, in
    the proposed protocol, to ensure proper utilization of node’s energy in every
    round, fuzzy logic technique is used for CHs selection, and to provide efficient
    coverage over entire area, region-based static clustering approach is used. The
    balanced use of fuzzy logic technique, region-wise node deployment and enhanced
    hybrid routing, saves much more amount of energy consumed by sensor nodes. When
    we compare the proposed protocol with EEHC, DEEC, DDEEC and RBHR, network lifetime
    of proposed protocol is increased as compared to the other protocols, because
    data is transmitted to BS only when it is required. Hence, proposed protocol minimizes
    the energy consumption of sensor nodes due to reduction in total number of data
    transmission per round. The data transmission thresholds (i.e. and ) can be set
    to receive information according to users need. Therefore, the information regarding
    the agricultural field received at BS helps the farmer to take a decision about
    irrigation. Further, this work may be extended to develop energy-efficient routing
    protocols for wireless sensor networks with mobile base station and sensor nodes.
    The work can be further extended to support multi-hop communication model in case
    of monitoring very large field. References Aderohunmu and Deng, 2009 F.A. Aderohunmu,

  description: A remote irrigation system based on GPRS and LabVIEW is designed, aimed
    at the requirements of modern precision agriculture and water-saving society.
    We use K60 as the lower monitor recording the temperature, humidity and other
    environmental parameters which sends the data by the transmission medium of GPRS.
    Through the internet network, the remote data are transmitted to the host computer.
    At the same time, an intelligent water-saving irrigation is realized by introducing
    the fuzzy control system. It plays an important role in studying wheat growth
    in further depth. The simulation experiment results show that the system is simple,
    stable and reliable. The interface is friendly. It meets the purpose and requirement
    of expected design.

    to be included as additional elements into current wireless sensor networks (WSN)
    in order to acquire and transmit image data. IEEE 802.15.4 protocol has become
    the de facto standard for the implementation of WSN due the low-cost and low-power
    consumption technology. However, this protocol has been designed to communicate
    small amount of data, which produces a big challenge when large image files are
    integrated into the current network infrastructure and have to be fragmented and
    transmitted into small data packets. This paper evaluates the performance of static
    and dynamic scheduling policies for the communication of image data through a
    WSN, in a typical precision agriculture application such as a closed-loop irrigation
    system. The parameters considered on the performance evaluation include communication
    bandwidth, packet loss rate, and also the effects on the overall performance of
    the irrigation system are analyzed.

    Low cost cameras and embedded devices with high processing capabilities have increased
    the use of computer vision systems for precision agriculture applications. Image
    processing devices may serve as remote sensing nodes to measure the vegetative
    development for different crop areas. Therefore, these types of devices require
    to be included as additional elements into current wireless sensor networks (WSN)
    in order to acquire and transmit image data. IEEE 802.15.4 protocol has become
    the de facto standard for the implementation of WSN due the low-cost and low-power
    consumption technology. However, this protocol has been designed to communicate
    small amount of data, which produces a big challenge when large image files are
    integrated into the current network infrastructure and have to be fragmented and
    transmitted into small data packets. This paper evaluates the performance of static
    and dynamic scheduling policies for the communication of image data through a
    WSN, in a typical precision agriculture application such as a closed-loop irrigation
    system. The parameters considered on the performance evaluation include communication

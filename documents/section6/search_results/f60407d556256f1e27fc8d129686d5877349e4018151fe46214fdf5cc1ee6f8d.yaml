    Get rights and content Abstract Precision farming makes use of information technologies
    in agriculture. With the satellite positioning system and electronic communication
    standards, position and time may be integrated into all procedures connected to
    farming. Today, precision farming is primarily geared towards site-specific application
    of fertilisers with the resulting cost advantages being quite small. Thus, precision
    farming will likely gain in importance only when viable additional benefits, such
    as reduced environmental burdens and increased flow of information, are recognised
    and evaluated and become part of the reward itself. Previous article in issue

    ‘precision farming’ has evolved into a current research topic all over the world.
    Today, most agricultural disciplines participate in this effort, encouraging progress
    in agricultural technology, which originally supplied the impetus through the
    integration of information technology into tractors, machines and implements.
    Interestingly enough, however, ‘precision farming’ is almost always associated
    with site-specific fertilisation. Expectations of farmers using the new technology
    are usually twofold — a decrease in fertiliser required for the same yield and/or
    higher yields with the use of the same amounts of fertiliser. Plant protection
    is secondary. Recently, there have also been demands for site-specific seeding.
    Yet, does ‘precision farming’ not really go beyond such concerns? Does it not
    mean extensive changes in every aspect of land cultivation, inside and outside,
    as well as with respect to tillage and livestock breeding? And, finally, does
    this approach not also influence forestry and horticulture? In other words, is
    it not rather the case that precision farming is the point of departure for a
    revised use of available land per se, a framework in which operation and herd
    sizes, wooded lots or horticultural acreages take second place to the central
    concerns of the environment, its variability and heterogeneity? 2. GPS as a supplier
    of position and time At the end of the 1980s, the ‘global positioning systems’
    (GPS), NAVSTAR-GPS and GLONASS, introduced a new era. For the military, positioning
    and time became available at any time and place. Both kinds of information could
    also be used for civilian purposes, even if the accuracy obtained was somewhat
    diminished. Today, civilian users of GPS may well be in the majority, when viewed
    world-wide. In North America and Europe, reference services provide positional
    accuracy of 1–5 m on-the-go. More advanced devices even reach decimetre accuracy,
    allowing for exact navigation or even automated navigation of vehicles. After
    switching SA off on May 2, 2000, NAVSTAR-GPS will fulfil positioning without differential
    services. Another improvement will be available with the transition of GPS to
    the next satellite generation and the European satellite navigation system Galileo
    which is likely to be implemented. Therefore, GPS is, and in the future will also
    be, a ‘technology available to everyone’. In agriculture, the possibilities for
    application will be seen in positioning and navigation (Fig. 1). Download : Download

    communication In Germany, the development and establishment of satellite-supported
    positioning and navigation happened almost simultaneously with the evolution of
    a standardised electronic communication system for agricultural purposes. After
    an 11-year standardisation effort, the ‘Landwirtschaftliches BUS-System’ (LBS)
    is now available to farmers in a large number of actual devices and implements.
    This allows for communication between tractors, implements and farm management
    systems geared towards the needs of European agriculture and its small-scale operations
    (Fig. 2). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. The ‘Landwirtschaftliches
    BUS-System (LBS)’ according to DIN 9684/2–5. At the same time, LBS functions as
    a basis for the international standards organisation (ISO) 11783 standardisation
    procedure. Here, with LBS and ISO data structures largely identical, direct integration
    of the tractor has been achieved, also taking into account larger tractor-implement
    units in North America and some parts of Europe. Both systems may be operated
    within one communication network. With identical physical components and data
    structure as well as an identically structured virtual terminal, software updates
    from LBS to ISO cause few problems. 4. Precision farming today With GPS and LBS
    (ISO 11783), both essential technologies for precision farming are now available.
    In response to demand, two different implementation strategies for fertilisation
    are now in use (Fig. 3). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Systematic
    approaches for the implementation of site-specific fertilisation. 4.1. The mapping
    approach The mapping approach is based on historical data about yield distribution
    and availability of plant nutrients in the soil. Both pieces of information can
    be established in practice enough accurately. 4.1.1. Yield measurements in the
    combine harvester Yield measurements in the combine harvester are state of the
    art technology. The mean error (calibration error) is less than 1%, the distribution
    of data for individual grain elevator loads shows a standard deviation of 3%.
    Under laboratory conditions, more significant differences in precision were found
    between different measuring principles, depending on the type of grain, flow capacity
    and gradient of the machine. 4.1.2. Soil sampling For soil sampling, certain standard
    procedures have evolved. Mixed sample for large sites taken from mapped positions
    (map unit size=1 ha, field size defined by driving around the field, mathematical
    map defined with an on-board computer, target navigation, taking of individual
    samples around sampling position for one mixed sample per designated map position).
    Mixed samples from yield zones with site yield history (sampling positions limited
    to three (maximum five) yield zones, mathematical sample positioning with the
    PC, relative assignment of sampling chart by means of driving around the field,
    target navigation, taking of individual samples around sampling position for one
    mixed sample per designated yield zone). Geo-referenced individual samples with
    yield information missing (limited to certain sampling sites, field size determined
    by driving around the field, minimum number of sampling positions mathematically
    defined, target navigation, individual samples taken with geo-referencing — possibly
    as a mixed sample around sampling position). Permanent navigational sampling positions
    for basic fertilisation in closed ‘precision farming’ systems with fertilisation
    to nutrient removal (one-time definition of permanent sampling positions, relative
    assignment of sampling chart by means of driving around the field, target navigation,
    individual samples taken with geo-positioning). This information allows for a
    one-time decision regarding phosphorus and potassium requirements for future vegetation.
    It also facilitates an estimate of the most suitable plant density subject to
    yield and soil specifics. This approach is useful for production under certain
    conditions, at stable weather conditions within the vegetation period, with a
    known deficit in the availability of nutrients phosphorus and potassium, and ignoring
    nitrogen top fertilisation for high yields. 4.2. Sensor approach Historical data
    are not enough if high yields are based on nitrogen fertilisation, livestock breeding
    ensures adequate nutrient supply with P and K, and the weather is subject to great
    changes. For such conditions, the sensor approach monitors actual growth conditions
    over time. To do this, plant chlorophyll reflectance is a very useful measurement
    because it correlates closely with nitrogen content of the plant and with resulting
    plant mass. At the same time, reflectance in the near infrared area is distinguishable
    easily from surrounding plant matter and soil. In combination with type-specific
    growth functions for individual plants, growth deficits may be detected and remedied
    by real-time application of nitrogen-fertilisers. Several studies have illustrated
    the efficiency of this approach, showing overall yield increases and more uniform
    yield distributions. 4.3. Plant protection For site-specific plant protection
    measures, mapping and sensor approaches have been developed in close analogy to
    fertilisation (Fig. 4). However, in practice, both approaches have been put to
    very limited use. The reasons are several. First, manual mapping is extremely
    labour-intensive as very limited technical support is available. Second, the accuracy
    of remote data collection is still unsatisfactory. It is not yet possible to analyse
    and interpret information thus obtained, automatically, or not with acceptable
    precision. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Systematic approaches for
    site-specific plant protection. Third, sensor approaches that collect data about
    spacing do not allow for plant-specific application. Fourth, image analysis approaches
    are still thwarted by extensive computation requirements in order to apply them
    to advanced direct injection systems. 5. Precision farming tomorrow In light of
    the technical possibilities of information technology that are available, the
    current use of precision farming must, at best, be called ‘modest’. Apart from
    economic concerns, three other reasons may be cited which are described below.
    5.1. The nitrogen and water problem With respect to fertilisation, the problems
    lie in plant-specific application of nitrogen taking into account the soil water
    available to the plant. Several improvements are needed. 5.1.1. Sensor approach
    with map overlay Existing sensor approaches always over fertilise poor growth
    sites, without taking into account local limitations of soil type and water supply.
    Such excess additions of nitrogen not tailored to crop needs might lead to ground
    water contamination. To avoid this, the sensor approach needs to be complemented
    by additional no-contact sensors for the acquisition of data about water stress
    in the plants, soil water available to the plants, and nitrogen available in the
    soil. Moreover, better models, that incorporate N requirements of individual cultures
    and types of plants, need to be developed, including information about the actual
    growth patterns of the crop as a whole or in the region (aerial photographs, satellite
    imagery), and local limitations from mapping information. 5.1.2. Equal spacing
    of plants Whereas in most cases, nitrogen may be applied and tailored to plant
    requirements without problems and at low cost, the delimiting factor in many regions
    around the globe is available soil water. Thus, precision farming must pay closer
    attention to this problem while thoroughly re-evaluating traditional cultivation
    systems. There is a dire need for an investigation of whether even plant spacing
    could not use available resources more efficiently, especially with generously
    spaced row cultures such as corn and soybeans, (Fig. 5). Initial experiments have
    shown that such approaches result not only in higher yields but also in significantly
    more efficient soil water and nitrogen uses. Additional improvements might be
    obtained by site-specific plant density. Download : Download full-size image Fig.
    5. Equal spacing of corn for silage. 5.2. Structural problems Precision farming
    today aims at heterogeneities within a crop, attempting to take into account the
    requirements (and environment). Thus, this agricultural system is geared toward
    large-scale farming, increasing its existing production advantages (Fig. 6). Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 6. Systematic integration of precision farming
    into existing agricultural structures. Most regions around the globe are dominated
    by small-scale farming operations. Precision farming, in such regions, must take
    the reverse approach and create economically and ecologically sound operations
    by ‘virtual land consolidation’, while keeping ownership structures intact (Fig.
    7). Initial analyses of existing ‘transborder farming systems’ show a saving of
    15–25% in required headland, 20–30% in required work time, and 100–300 ϵ per ha
    in costs. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 7. Precision farming on the
    basis of ‘virtual land consolidation’. 5.3. Improvements in genetic engineering
    Along with improvements in plant performance characteristics, genetic engineering
    in agriculture is aimed mainly at improving resistance to disease. Results affect
    plant protection, reducing the need for intensive control efforts as in traditional
    cultivation systems. Significant implications are to be expected in the area of
    weed control, a leading concern with respect to overall effort and acreages affected.
    Thus, precision farming will have to meet new challenges found in precise application
    of minimal chemical amounts, accommodation for chemical bonding to the soil humus,
    and improving efficiency by integrating chemical applications with available soil
    water. Furthermore, because genetic engineering advances are expected to be more
    rapid than other technologies, such as plant identification systems, those latter
    technologies are likely to become subsumed and lose much of their importance.
    6. Environmental impact In light of extensive on-going research activities, development
    and implementation of precision farming around the globe is rather discouraging.
    Approximately 10% of the available agricultural land in the US Midwest benefits
    from yield mapping. In Europe, application of precision agriculture includes well-developed
    sites in UK, Eastern Germany and Denmark. The implementation of site-specific
    fertilisation measures, with data obtained from yield mapping, is even less. Site-specific
    plant protection measures are negligible. Naturally, this raises the question
    of whether precision farming in this form is really needed or if there are important
    reasons for such restrained use. 6.1. No uniform systems available Despite the
    completion of standardisation procedures, there are currently no uniform electronic
    communication systems available in agriculture. In Europe, LBS is used by a certain
    number of manufacturers. There are significant problems with respect to implementation
    caused by a lack of know-how on the manufacturers’ side and by different possible
    interpretations of the standards. For ISO 11783, the problems will even grow worse
    because the currently defined rate of data transfer represents an enormous bottleneck
    for a substantially increased information volume. Improvements in performance
    can only be obtained via fibre-optic cables which, in turn, lead to additional
    problems when used for mobile agricultural technology. The situation is aggravated
    by globalisation, i.e. the reduction of manufacturers to a handful of ‘global
    players,’ resulting from corporate mergers. For reasons of cost-efficiency, their
    strategies are likely to favour closed systems allowing them to gain a competitive
    edge. 6.2. More technology leads to more costs With the integration of information
    technology, precision farming requires more and more comprehensive technology,
    which, while performing better, is also more cost-intensive. However, potential
    savings are relatively small if operations are already running close to optimal
    capacity without the technology. In this case, site-specific fertilisation will,
    at best, lead to a redistribution of the amounts of fertiliser used, and the resulting
    increase in yields are comparatively modest and may not cover additional costs
    unless very large sites are involved. Additional costs, therefore, may only be
    recovered by new management options and reduced environmental impacts, resulting
    from higher quality information. For these benefits, no nationally or internationally
    recognised assessment schemes exist. 6.3. Documentation and environmental performance
    This leads to the question of whether environmental performance should or must
    be documented. Precision farming supplies the tools for such a documentation if
    electronic communication is extended to all machines and equipment. With the implement
    indicator (IMI), this will be possible at low cost, with LBS and GPS once more
    being prerequisites. Definitions for data acquisition density, and thus, for the
    stipulations in the task controller, are required (Fig. 8). The data obtained
    could be the basis for all kinds of environmental achievements as a geo-referenced
    documentation of measures taken (a mark of quality in the resulting products)
    and for public funds designed for environmentally sound agriculture. Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 8. The IMI for automated documentation of geo-referenced
    process data. 6.4. New environmental achievements In this context, precision farming
    could lead to additional environmental achievements. 6.4.1. Fleet management Fleet
    management for the timing of field work and co-ordination of available equipment
    will result in less traffic (via optimised unloading procedures) and a decrease
    in the number of trips, more adequate co-ordination of transport vehicles and
    site-specific accumulation of goods, machinery use in accordance with soil moisture
    and a decrease in energy costs, and integration of local information about soil
    conditions and soil type in maximum load control to avoid permanent soil compressions.
    6.4.2. Field robots Field robots will optimise the use of machinery and lead to
    the decreases in multiple field visitation and overlaps in the application of
    fertiliser and plant protection agents by means of seamless navigation, improved
    total work efficiency by the use of manned guiding vehicles and unmanned follow-up
    units, and a potential reversal of the trend toward ever larger machinery in favour
    of the development and use of smaller field robots. 7. Conclusions The precision
    farming developments of today can provide the technology for the environment friendly
    agriculture of tomorrow. This can be seen in the areas described here below. •
    GPS will supply the required accuracy. Further progress is expected by the improvement
    of NAVSTAR-GPS and the impending installation of Galileo. • Through the standardisation
    within LBS and ISO 11783, mobile electronic communication will be available. Whether
    this signifies the emergence of open systems for tractor-implement combinations
    — independent of manufacturers and of manufacturer-specific systems made by the
    few remaining global agricultural technology providers — remains to be seen. •
    Basic fertilisation with the mapping approach is a system that is available already.
    With fertilisation after removal, intensive sample-taking would become largely
    redundant. • With respect to nitrogen fertilisation, the development of online-sensor
    systems is taking shape. By means of map overlay, site-specific limitations and
    also excess dosages may be taken into account. • With respect to plant protection,
    current manual assessment has proven to be time- and cost-intensive. It remains
    to be seen whether progress in genetic engineering will point site-specific application
    towards a new direction. • Enormous potentials for precision farming may be seen
    in an overall approach to environmentally sound agriculture. These may only be
    tapped, however, if the environmental benefits of geo-referenced information are
    financially rewarded. • Through the use of geo-referenced information, the potential
    of fleet management and field robotics can come to fruition. In this vein, precision
    farming today is already able to supply the technology required for the environmentally
    sound agriculture of tomorrow. Huge efforts will be involved in activating its
    slumbering potentials for the benefit of the environment. Further reading Auernhammer,

    sensing 1. Introduction Agriculture production systems have benefited from incorporation
    of technological advances primarily developed for other industries. The industrial
    age brought mechanization and synthesized fertilizers to agriculture. The technology
    age offered genetic engineering and automation. The information age brings the
    potential for integrating the technological advances into precision agriculture
    (PA) (Whelan et al., 1997). The factual base of PA-the spatial and temporal variability
    of soil and crop factors within a field—has been appreciated for centuries. Before
    the completion of agricultural mechanization, the very small size of fields allowed
    farmers to vary treatments manually. However, with the enlargement of fields and
    intensive mechanization, it has become increasingly more difficult to take account
    of within-field variability without a revolutionary development in technologies
    (Stafford, 2000). PA is conceptualized by a system approach to re-organize the
    total system of agriculture towards a low-input, high-efficiency, sustainable
    agriculture (Shibusawa, 1998). This new approach mainly benefits from the emergence
    and convergence of several technologies, including the Global Positioning System
    (GPS), geographic information system (GIS), miniaturized computer components,
    automatic control, in-field and remote sensing, mobile computing, advanced information
    processing, and telecommunications (Gibbons, 2000). Agricultural industry is now
    capable of gathering more comprehensive data on production variability in both
    space and time. The desire to respond to such variability on a fine-scale has
    become the goal of PA (Whelan et al., 1997). After more than 10 years of development,
    PA has reached a crossroad with much of the necessary technology available but
    with the environmental and economic benefits yet unproven (Stafford, 2000). Many
    technological innovations have been presented but development of agronomic and
    ecological principles for optimized recommendations for inputs at the localized
    level is generally lagging. Many farmers are uncertain as to whether to adopt
    available PA technologies on their farms. Motivations for widespread uptake of
    PA technologies may come from strict environment legislation, public concern over
    excessive use of agro-chemicals, and economic gain from reduced agricultural inputs
    and improved farm management efficiency. After all, success of PA technologies
    will have to be measured by economic and environmental gains. 2. Spatial and temporal
    variability Variabilities that have significant influences on agricultural production
    can be categorized into six groups. 2.1. Yield variability Historical and present
    yield distributions. 2.2. Field variability Field topography—elevation, slope,
    aspect, and terrace; proximity to field boundary and streams, etc. 2.3. Soil variability
    Soil fertility—N, P, K, Ca, Mg, C, Fe, Mn, Zn, and Cu; soil fertility as provided
    by manure; soil physical properties-texture, density, mechanical strength, moisture
    content, and electric conductivity; soil chemical properties—pH, organic matter,
    salinity, and CEC; soil plant-available water-holding capacity and hydraulic conductivity;
    and soil depth. 2.4. Crop variability Crop density; crop height; crop nutrient
    stress for N, P, K, Ca, Mg, C, Fe, Mn, Zn, and Cu; crop water stress; crop biophysical
    properties—leaf-area index (LAI), intercepted photosynthetically active radiation,
    and biomass; crop leaf chlorophyll content; and crop grain quality. 2.5. Variability
    in anomalous factors Weed infestation; insect infestation; nematode infestation;
    disease infestation; wind damage, and hay damage. 2.6. Management variability
    Tillage practice; crop hybrid; crop seeding rate; crop rotation; fertilizer application;
    pesticide application; and irrigation pattern. Among these variability types,
    yield variability is often considered the ultimate dependent variable, whereas
    most other variability types are treated as independent variables. The most extensively
    studied independent variable to date has been soil nitrogen fertility level. In
    fact, most variable-rate technologies (VRT) for chemical applications have been
    developed on nitrogen-fertilizer applicators. Many types of variability are both
    spatial and temporal in nature. Weed infestation serves as an example. Spatial
    weed-patch patterns may change during the crop-growing season. Variabilities in
    climate parameters are mostly temporal in nature. However, intensive precipitation
    monitoring across fields is also important to assisting decision making for fertilizer
    applications (O''Neal et al., 2000). 3. Managing variability Managing the variability
    can be achieved by two approaches: the map-based approach and the sensor-based
    approach. With available technologies of GPS, remote sensing, yield monitoring,
    and soil sampling, the map-based approach is generally easier to implement. This
    approach requires the following procedure: grid sampling a field, performing laboratory
    analyzes of soil samples, generating a site-specific map, and, finally, using
    this map to control a variable-rate applicator. A positioning system, such as
    a GPS, is usually required for this approach. The sensor-based approach, on the
    other hand, measures the desired properties, such as soil and plant properties,
    using real-time sensors in an ‘on-the-go’ fashion and controls variable-rate applicator
    based on the measurements. For the sensor-based approach, a positioning device
    is not always needed. Most experimental precision-agriculture systems are map-based
    systems, because most on-the-go sensors for monitoring the field, soil, and field
    variability are too expensive, not sufficiently accurate, or not available. Spatial
    databases have been generated using various GIS systems by integrating maps derived
    from remote sensing, soil sampling, yield monitoring, and various sensors. Advanced
    geo-statistical methods are used to analyze the spatial and temporal variability
    (Pena-Yewtukhiw et al., 2000). Crop-modeling techniques have been incorporated
    to develop yield potential maps as a base for fertilizer prescription (Werner
    et al., 2000). These maps can be used to predict variability in crop growth and
    crop disease based on projected climatic conditions. Thus, PA provides an ideal
    tool for agricultural risk assessment and rational farm-work scheduling. 4. Management
    zone Site-specific applications of agricultural inputs can be implemented by dividing
    a field into smaller management zones that are more homogeneous in properties
    of interest than the field as a whole. A management zone is defined as ‘a portion
    of a field that expresses a homogeneous combination of yield-limiting factors
    for which a single rate of a specific crop input is appropriate’ (Doerge, 1998).
    Thus, management zones within a field may be different for different inputs, and
    delineation of management zones for a specific input involves only the factors
    directly influencing the effectiveness of that input in achieving certain goals.
    A management zone also can be delineated by more than one specific crop inputs.
    In this case, a single rate is applied for each of the specific inputs within
    a zone. The number of distinct management zones within a field is a function of
    the natural variability within the field, the size of the field, and certain management
    factors. The minimum size of a zone is limited by the ability of the farmer to
    differentially manage regions within a field. If a GPS is involved to control
    the application or to guide the implement, there seems no reason for restrictions
    on the shape of the zone. However, in reality, the pattern in which the application
    equipment traverses the field should be considered when delineating the management
    zones (Kvien and Pocknee, 2000). The concept of management zone may be perceived
    as a setback from the early PA concept of ‘farming by foot’. However, management
    zones are more practical to implement. Delineating management zones involves spatial
    filtering to reduce effects of noise in measurements of individual factors. Removal
    of excessive details in within-field variability simplifies the shapes of the
    zones and, thus, reduces the requirements for VRT equipment. Chang et al. (2000)
    compared different approaches to classify nutrient management zones. Zhang and
    Taylor (2000) introduced methods of delineating management zones using morphological-
    and spatial-filtering tools. 5. Impact of precision agriculture The impact of
    PA technologies on agricultural production is expected in two areas: profitability
    for the producers and ecological and environmental benefits to the public. 5.1.
    Profitability PA allows precise tracking and tuning of farm production. PA technologies
    provide farmers with opportunities of changing the distribution and timing of
    fertilizers and other agrochemicals based on spatial and temporal variability
    in a field. Farmers can make economic analyzes based on the variability of crop
    yield in a field to obtain accurate assessment of risk. For example, a farmer
    could verify that, for 70% of the time, 75% of the barley grown in a field would
    yield 3.8 tones. By knowing the cost of inputs, farmers can also calculate the
    cash return over the costs for each hectare. Certain parts within a field, which
    always produce below the breakeven line, can be isolated for the development of
    a site-specific management plan (Goddard, 1997). The economic benefits resulting
    from PA, however, have proven difficult to measure (Lowenberg-DeBoer, 1996). Griffin
    et al. (2000) compared VRT with uniform-rate technology (URT) for phosphorus application
    on a rice and soybean rotation in Arkansas and found that the profitability of
    VRT was highly sensitive to both residual P and soil clay content. Even when VRT
    was found profitable on silt loam fields, switching from URT to VRT during a 10
    year planning horizon may be unadvisable, as increased revenue from yields does
    not cover the cost for VRT implementation. If a whole-farm approach, which takes
    all cropping activities and resource limitations into account, is adapted, PA
    technologies may prove to be beneficial for improving profit potential and for
    reducing the risks (Oriade and Popp, 2000). 5.2. Environment Strict environmental
    legislations have been present in countries like USA, Australia, UK, Denmark,
    and Germany. In the near future, European Union directives may well be established
    that will force farmers in member countries to significantly reduce usage of agro-chemicals.
    PA provides the means of precise and targeted application, recording of all field
    treatments at the meter scale, tracking from operation to operation, and transfer
    of recorded information with the harvested products. (Stafford, 2000), all of
    which would assist in enforcement of the legislations. Although the environmental
    benefits of PA have not been systematically and quantitatively measured (Lowenberg-DeBoer,
    1996), some researches have revealed positive evidences. Nitrate leaching has
    been a major problem in potato cropping systems, especially in coarse-textured
    soils. A study conducted in two adjacent fields, one treated with URT for nitrogen
    fertilizer and the other with VRT, has demonstrated the effect of VRT in reducing
    the ground water contamination (Whitley et al., 2000). With the availability of
    topographic data for fields implemented with PA technologies, the interaction
    between tillage and soil/water erosion can be examined and, thus, reduction in
    erosion can be achieved (Schumacher et al., 2000). 6. Engineering innovations
    While agronomists are playing the leading role in PA development, engineers have
    worked diligently to provide technologies needed to implement PA practices. Engineering
    innovations for PA involve development of sensors, controls, and remote-sensing
    technologies. 6.1. Sensors Robust, low-cost, and, preferably, real-time sensing
    systems are needed for implementing various PA technologies. Commercial products
    have become available for some sensor types. Others are currently under development.
    6.1.1. Yield sensors Grain yields are measured using four types of yield sensors-impact
    or mass flow sensors, weight-based sensors, optical yield sensors, and γ-ray sensors.
    Most major agricultural equipment companies provide optional yield-mapping systems
    for their combine harvesters. Yield sensing techniques for major crops are approaching
    maturity. For forage crops, yield monitors using a displacement sensor, a load
    cell, a capacitance-controlled oscillator, and an optical sensor have been studied.
    An optical sensor measuring spectral radiance in the red and NIR wavebands was
    used to estimate yield during cropping seasons and to guide VRT for nitrogen fertilizer
    (Solie et al., 2000). A simple, low cost, and automatic yield mapping system was
    developed to generate yield maps of hand-harvested crops (Schueller et al., 1999).
    A continuous mass-flow type yield sensing system, equipped with load cells and
    a vibration-resistant angle transducer along with a DGPS, was developed to collect
    spatially variable yield data for tomato in real-time (Pelletier and Upadhyaya,
    1999) 6.1.2. Field sensors Commercial sensors receiving and processing GPS signals
    have become affordable for most farmers in developed countries. Handheld GPS receivers
    provide positioning accuracy within±100 m. Differential GPS (DGPS) reduces the
    error to±2m. A relative positioning GPS brings the error down to the sub-centimeter
    level. This accuracy can be maintained for moving vehicles using a real-time kinematic
    (RTK) GPS. Dux et al. (1999) used a geo-referenced audio recorder with a speech-recognition
    capability to generate field maps during field scouting. This system allows users
    to record visual observations on crop growth, weeds, diseases, or other anomalies
    while walking or riding an ATV within a field. Yule et al. (1999) developed a
    data acquisition system to monitor in-field performance of an agricultural tractor.
    Performance parameters mapped during field operations were used to analyze field
    variabilities of topology, soil type, and soil moisture content, and to identify
    areas in field needing remedial actions. 6.1.3. Soil sensors A near infrared (NIR)
    soil sensor measured soil spectral reflectance within the waveband of 1600–2600
    nm to predict soil organic matter and moisture contents of surface and subsurface
    soils (Hummel et al., 2001). An on-line, real-time soil spectrophotometer measures
    soil spectral reflectance in the visible and NIR wavebands at a ground speed of
    3.6 km/h. Field tests demonstrated linear relationships between reflectance at
    certain wavelengths and various soil properties, including soil organic matter
    and moisture content (Shibusawa et al., 2000). A soil electrical-conductivity
    (EC) sensor based on a four-electrode method has proven effective in detecting
    several yield-limiting factors in non-saline soils (Lund et al., 2000). In France,
    an eight-rolling-electrode sensor was developed to measure soil EC at three depths
    (Dabas et al., 2000). Combining a soil EC probe with an automated penetrometer,
    soil subsurface can be mapped (Drummond et al., 2000). A soil EC sensor using
    the electromagnetic-induction method is a non-contact sensor. EC measured using
    this sensor correlated well with a soil productivity index, which combines effects
    of bulk density, water-holding capacity, salt, and pH (Myers et al., 2000). EC
    measured before planting can be related to plant-available-water-holding capacity
    (Morgan et al., 2000). A penetrometer equipped with a near-infrared reflectance
    sensor measured soil penetration resistance as well as moisture content and organic
    matter (Newman and Hummel, 1999). A penetrometer combined with a soil EC sensor
    can be used to measure soil hardpan (Clark et al., 2000). Soil moisture-content
    sensors were designed under different physical principles, including time-domain
    reflectivity (TDR), standing-wave ratio (Sun et al., 1999), and depolarization
    of a laser light (Zhang et al., 2000a). A ground-penetrating radar was used to
    produce a contour map to indicate clay lenses, which govern the magnitude and
    direction of ground-water movement (Dulaney et al., 2000). 6.1.4. Crop sensors
    Thai et al. (1999) used a field spectral-imaging system with a liquid crystal
    tunable filter in peanut and cotton fields. A near-ground scanning radiometer
    mounted on a tractor mapped vegetative-indices (Stafford and Bolam, 1998). Sudduth
    et al. (2000) designed an electromechanical sensor to count corn plants. Cotton
    plant height was measured using mechanical fingers and infrared light beams (Searcy
    and Beck, 2000). Grain protein and oil content sensors are currently under development.
    A cotton mass-flow and strength sensor was developed using a halogen lamp and
    an NIR light (Keskin et al., 1999). An infrared thermometer was used to measure
    canopy temperature to control irrigation events (Evans et al., 2000). A capacitance
    sensor, a sensor measuring power required at the PTO shaft, a microwave sensor,
    and a NIR sensor were tested to measure moisture content of forage (Marcotte et
    al., 1999). An on-line, real-time spectrophotometer developed by Anom et al. (2000)
    was used to map plant water, nutrient, disease, and salinity stresses. It was
    projected that development in gene manipulation of crop plants may further enable
    differentiation between these stress types (Stafford, 2000). Michels et al. (2000)
    designed an infrared plant-temperature transducer to sense plant temperature changes
    caused by water stress. Ahmad et al. (1999) used a chlorophyll meter coupled with
    a DGPS to map nitrogen stress in corn. A multispectral radiometer was employed
    to detect crop salinity stress. Rial and Han (1999) studied the performance of
    a commercial complex permittivity sensor in measuring ionic nutrients. 6.1.5.
    Anomaly sensors Several weed sensors are commercially available. Tian et al. (1999)
    developed an intelligent sensing and spraying system to identify weed-infested
    zones with a high accuracy. Feyaerts et al. (1998) designed a weed sensor using
    an imaging spectrograph. Wang et al. (2001) developed an optical weed sensor based
    on a study on spectral characteristics of weeds, crops, and soil. An infrared
    plant-temperature transducer developed by Michels et al. (2000) was used to sense
    plant temperature changes caused by greenbug infestation. 6.2. Controls 6.2.1.
    VRT agro-chemical applicators Many manufacturers are now producing controllers,
    sprayers, air spreader, anhydrous ammonia systems, and herbicide applicators for
    VRT applications. Bennett and Brown (1999) developed a direct nozzle injection
    system for herbicide application. Swisher et al. (1999) designed an optical sensor
    to measure flow rates of granular fertilizer in air streams for feedback control
    of a variable-rate spreader. 6.2.2. Automatic guidance systems An automatic guidance
    system can position a moving vehicle within 30 cm or less using high-precision
    DGPS. It may replace conventional equipment markers for spraying or seeding and
    may serve as a valuable field-scouting tool (Goddard, 1997). 6.2.3. Robotic harvesting
    systems Japanese researchers proposed an advanced, automatic follow-up vehicle
    system and an autonomous vehicle for multiple farm operations (Iida et al., 1998).
    Harvesting robots for tomato, cherry tomato, cucumber, strawberry, grape, and
    watermelon were already commercialized. It is predicted that more robotic harvesting
    systems will be commercialized in early 21st Century (Umeda et al., 1999). 6.2.4.
    Networked systems A distributed control system using controlled area network (CAN)
    communication between individual sensors and actuators, a supervising controller,
    and a navigation system was designed and installed to control spray droplet size
    and application rate for agricultural chemicals (Stone et al., 1999). 6.3. Remote
    sensing Remote sensing techniques have seen limited use in PA due to the need
    for high spatial resolution images. According to recent literature, remotely sensed
    images have been used to predict nitrogen need in corn (Scharf and Lory, 2000),
    to estimate cotton lint yield (Li et al., 2000, Hendrickson and Han, 2000), to
    assess insect damage in wheat (Riedell et al., 2000), to detect spider mite in
    cotton (Fitzgerald et al., 2000), to assist in insecticide application (Seal et
    al., 2000), to estimate clay concentration of surface soil (Chen et al., 2000),
    to detect weeds (Varner et al., 2000), to quantify hail or wind damage in crops
    (Erickson et al., 2000), or to detect and classify anomalies (unusual phenomena)
    (Carter and Johannsen, 2000). Satellite remote sensing has held out much promise
    for within-field monitoring but has yet to demonstrate hard evidence for complete
    success. Problems include timeliness, cloud cover, cost, poor spatial resolution,
    and lack of processing to produce image data of use to the crop managers. Hyperspectral
    sensing is a relatively new technology that is capable of providing information
    over a nearly continuous spectrum in the visible, NIR, and MIR wavebands. Images
    acquired from hyperspectral sensors have been used for estimation of crop vigor
    and yield prediction; discrimination between crops, weeds, residue, and soil;
    and quantitative measurements of crop water content and leaf area index. Measurement
    in the MIR band also has potential for providing information on plant nutrient
    and soil properties (Deguise and McNairn, 2000). 7. Information management After
    more than a decade of research and practice, PA has accumulated a huge amount
    of data and is now facing a serious problem of ‘data overflow’. For the spatial/temporal
    information that has been collected, there is an urgent need for tools specifically
    designed for data storage, processing, management, and analysis. There is also
    a strong need for data-exchange standardization. 7.1. Field-level GIS General-purpose
    GIS packages, such as arcview, idrisi, and surfer, provide many functions, some
    of which offer little value to PA applications. Most of these packages are expensive
    and require computer platforms that are not usually possessed by farmers. To address
    the urgent need for PA applications at the field level, many commercial GIS packages,
    such as the software packages introduced by AGRIS Corporation, Farm Works™, Agri-Logic,
    Inc., John Deere Precision Farming Group, Case Corporation, Rockwell International,
    and RDI Technologies, Inc., have been developed (Ess et al., 1997). Some systems
    directly interact with DGPS devices or yield sensors to acquire location and yield
    data in real time. Runquist et al. (2001) developed a field-level GIS (FIS) containing
    analytical functions for spatial data analysis in PA research. 7.2. Data interchange
    standardization PA technologies are information-based technologies. As the amount
    of data generated from both mobile and static sources increases, a need for standardized
    data communication and standardized file and data trasfer has been recognized.
    Great efforts have been made to establish an international standard (ISO 11783)
    for communication protocols on mobile, agricultural and forestry machines using
    CANs to provide exchangeability between sensor and actuator products provided
    by different manufacturers and to allow modular design of new products. File and
    data formats have been standardized in ISO 11787 (referred to as ‘ADIS’—agricultural
    data interchange standard) and are in use by some manufacturers. With these standards,
    information can be exchanged smoothly and efficiently between sensors, processors,
    controllers, and software packages produced by different manufacturers (Stafford,
    2000). 8. Worldwide applications PA research started in the US, Canada, Australia,
    and Western Europe in mid-to-late 1980s. Although a considerable research effort
    has been expended, it is still only a portion of farmers who have practiced any
    type of PA technologies. Implementation of PA has mainly been through utilization
    of existing field machinery by adding controllers and GPS to enable spatially-variable
    applications. To date, the leading application of PA still is the site-specific
    application of fertilizers. In Australia, monitoring and mapping the spatial variability
    in small-grain crop yields have received much publicity. Crop-yield monitors are
    available for potato, peanut, and forage harvesters and, still under development,
    for cotton harvesters to monitor both quantitative and qualitative parameters.
    The total number of grain yield monitors operating in Australia is below 200 at
    present, comparing to USA, which has between 5000 and 10 000 operating units (half
    with DGPS capability). The movement towards PA in Australia is considered not
    strong (Whelan et al., 1997). In Japan, the Ministry of Agriculture has started
    to invest in PA research projects, focusing on sensing and controls related to
    agricultural mechanization. Japan is characterized by a small-scale and labor-intensive
    agriculture based on individual plant management. Japanese agriculture has faced
    many serious problems during the past two decades, including rice-production surplus,
    rapid reduction in agricultural workforce, shift in farmers’ age group, and growing
    environmental concerns. Japanese agriculture is diverse in field size, crop variety,
    field elevation, water management scheme, climate, soil, and the like. It was
    believed that PA technologies can fit into different farm scales only after a
    reorganization of the agricultural structure (Shibusawa, 1998). Despite the fact
    that most PA experiments were concentrated on VRT applications of fertilizers
    and herbicides, diverse types of PA technologies have been experimented throughout
    the world. Reports on PA experiments in China, Korea, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Sri
    Lanka, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Australia, Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Russia,
    Italy, The Netherlands, Germany, France, UK, United States, and Canada have been
    found in recent literatures.VRT application of lime has been proven successful
    in the southeast region of the US (Heiniger and Meijer, 2000). VRT also was tested
    on corn hybrids and seeding rates in Colorado (Shanahan et al., 2000). Bauer et
    al. (2000) conducted field tests in Missouri to determine optimum planting densities
    in different fields. A similar experiment conducted in Kansas showed no economic
    benefit by varying planting rate (Zhang et al., 1999). In California, potentials
    of PA technologies in rice production are being evaluated through an intensive
    study (Roel et al., 2000). Also in California, an experiment was conducted to
    study the feasibility of PA technologies in tomato production (Rosa et al., 2000).
    In Costa Rica, an experiment was conducted to apply PA technologies in a banana
    plantation. The system allows farmers to link to a soil database and to make site-specific
    decisions on soil fertility- and disease-related problems through yield monitoring.
    A cable system was used to replace expensive DGPS (Stoorvogel and Orlich, 2000).
    Johnson and Bradow (2000) studied the effects of a number of soil properties,
    including soil Mn, Mg, and K, on cotton fiber quality in Louisiana and believed
    that PA technologies may be applied to improve the quality. Gimenez and Lamothe
    (2000) conducted a field experiment in Uruguay to assess the benefit of site-specific
    Zn management and concluded that profit obtained by VRT of Zn application may
    reach $50 per hectare. PA also was used to optimize irrigation operations. In
    South Carolina, plant water stress was monitored using infrared thermometers on
    a center-pivot irrigation system to control the system operation (Evans et al.,
    2000). In Arizona, Adamsen et al. (2000) studied surface irrigation systems and
    found that water application is inherently non-uniform in these systems because
    of the spatial and temporal variability of soil infiltration characteristics.
    Thus, adjusting the irrigation system''s physical design or developing management
    practices specific to individual fields may prove to be beneficial to the farmers.
    McKinion et al. (2001) applied a PA approach to cotton production in Mississippi
    to automate the calculation of optimum water and N rates. They believed that PA
    coupled with crop simulation models and GIS can optimize yields while minimizing
    water and nitrogen inputs. Site-specific pest control has been tested in different
    crops. In the UK, potential for varying nematicide-rate in potato fields was studied
    by Stafford and Evans (2000). Site-specific control of northern corn rootworms
    was studied in South Dakota (Ellsbury et al., 2000). McLaughlin and Burtt (2000)
    used draft sensors on a three-point hitch of a tractor to record draft data and
    made a tillage-energy map in Ontario, Canada. Such maps may provide an additional,
    inexpensive map layer for soil-related information for PA applications. Draft
    force on a mouldboard plow was recorded by Hayhoe et al. (2000). They applied
    Fourier analysis on the periodical draft signals and found that lower frequency
    components of the signals may be related to local spatial variability in soil
    physical properties, such as soil moisture, soil texture, organic matter, and
    soil strength/compaction. In Wisconsin, Schuler and Lowery (2000) used a TDR sensor
    in subsoiler shanks to measure soil moisture content while subsoiling. The signal
    was used to control the subsoiler operating depth to match varying soil conditions.
    PA technologies were experimented in hay and forage production in Quebec, Canada
    (Marcotte et al., 1999). Sensors that continuously measure the weights in the
    baler and the trailing wagon and sensors that simultaneously measure mass flow
    and moisture content were tested. Successful development of these sensors may
    enable several PA applications, including cultivar selection, optimization of
    hay or silage additives, yield mapping, and forage crop management. PA technologies
    also have been used in forest production. In Washington, GPS receivers and dataloggers
    were used to track activities of log harvesting machines (Reutebuch et al., 1999).
    9. Adoption trend In 1998, a nationwide survey was conducted by USDA over nearly
    8500 agricultural producers in the US. According to the survey results, it was
    estimated that, by 1998, only four percent of all farms used one or more PA technologies
    for crop production. However, there is a significant variation in adoption rates
    by specific technology, region, farm size, farm type, and operator characteristics.
    The most widely adopted technologies were grid sampling (2% of all farms) and
    VRT for fertilizer (2%), followed by yield monitoring (1%) and yield mapping (1%).
    Variable-rate seed and pesticide application and remote sensing technologies were
    used only on less than 1% of all farms. Farm size, measured in terms of gross
    sales, was positively correlated with adoption rate. Grain/oilseed farms were
    found to have the highest rate of adoption (14%) primarily because of the widespread
    availability of yield monitors. Adoption rate for specialized fruit, vegetable,
    and nut farms is 5%. The main PA technology used in these farms was VRT for pesticide
    control (Daberkow and McBride, 2000). Cook et al. (2000) found that farmers in
    Australia are adopting PA technologies more slowly than expected. They attribute
    the slow adoption to four factors: (1) cost of adoption, (2) lack of perceived
    benefit from adoption, (3) unwillingness to be early adopters, and (4) lack of
    technology delivery mechanism. Although the cost, lack of perceived benefit, and
    conservatism among farmers have indeed caused the slowness in adoption, the problem
    in delivering the PA technologies to farmers has been identified as the major
    obstacle. Delivering PA technologies to farmers requires knowledge and skills
    that most consulting agencies currently do not possess. The conservatism of the
    consultancy sector seemed to create more difficulties than the conservatism of
    farmers in adopting PA technologies. In the UK, a survey was conducted among 25%
    of about 350 farmers who are currently conducting yield mapping using GPS. Results
    of the survey showed that the adopters of yield mapping have passed the first
    stage of initial uptake and enthusiasm and are now standing at the second stage
    of PA implementation. Farmers adopting yield mapping are in urgent needs for good
    advices from agronomists on interpreting yield maps and converting them into management
    plans. Yield mapping information needs to be integrated with farm decision-support
    systems (Griffin, 2000). A similar survey conducted in Arkansas indicated that
    early PA adopters represent less than 20 percent of Arkansas farmers. These adopters
    are young, educated, computer using, experienced farmers with large amounts of
    acreage predominantly devoted to rice and soybeans. While agricultural industry
    representatives are helping promote PA technologies, Cooperative Extension Service
    personnel have served as the main source for technical consultation. Farmers are
    waiting for research results on profitability of various PA technologies before
    increasing their investment significantly to adopt more technologies (Popp and
    Griffin, 2000). The following barriers need to be overcome before PA technologies
    can be widely implemented in a fast pace: 1 Data overflow for farm management.
    This problem has to be overcome by developing data integration tools, expert systems,
    and decision support systems. 2 Lack of rational procedures and strategies for
    determining application requirements on a localized basis and a parallel lack
    of scientifically validated evidence for the benefits claimed for the PA concept.
    3 Labor-intensive and costly data collection. Development of rapid sensing systems
    must take place before PA can be widely practiced. 4 Lack of technology-transfer
    channels and personnel. Educational programs involving researchers, industry,
    extension specialists, and consultants are urgently needed. PA technology will
    likely gain more recognition when additional benefits, such as reduced environmental
    burdens and increased information flow, are recognized as a part of its rewards
    (Auernhammer, 2001). 10. New trends in PA research The following new trends in
    PA research have been observed from recent literature: 10.1. Integrated approaches
    Most researchers have used the map and sensor approaches separately to address
    individual PA problems. However, a group of scientists in Germany are making an
    effort to integrate these two approaches for VRT application of nitrogen fertilizer.
    This requires development of reference values of crop-specific nitrogen requirement,
    on-line sensing of nitrogen and water conditions in plant and in soil, integration
    of remotely-sensed data, real-time data acquisition and transmission, and establishment
    of data base for universal use of site-specific fertilization and economic/ecological
    evaluations (Auernhammer et al., 1999). Because mixed and, sometimes, conflicting
    results and opinions regarding the use of PA technologies exist, a more aggressive
    team approach to determine the economics and viability of current and future PA
    strategies is needed. Johnson et al. (2000) initiated a field research project
    in Minnesota, involving a partnership between university research and extension
    specialists, farmers, and agribusiness sectors to analyze the economic and biological
    impact and to assess risks related to different PA strategies. 10.2. Forward-looking
    approaches Dynamic characteristics of farm operations require a forward-looking
    approach to respond to fertilizer, pesticide, and water needs proactively in portions
    of a field. A research project conducted in the Netherlands used sensors, simulation
    models, and real-time weather data to keep track of actual conditions in field.
    Warning signals were generated once deficiency was detected. Crop production could
    thus be maximized without exceeding chemical application limitations imposed by
    environment legislation (Van Alphen et al., 2000). 10.3. Internet-based information
    network In Germany, an effort is made to develop an Internet-based communication
    and information network for all aspects of the agribusiness, including farms,
    cooperatives, farming companies, contractors, dealers, and suppliers, in order
    to develop an integral management strategy for the entire agribusiness, enabling
    more farmers to participate in and benefit from PA technologies (Lutticken, 2000).
    11. Potential applications in China Technological progress in PA has attracted
    attention of Chinese agricultural engineers since mid-1990s (Wang, 1998). Entering
    the information-based economy era, the time lag of developing countries in adopting
    new technologies has greatly reduced (Wang, 1999b). It has been predicted that
    adoption of PA technologies in China will take the following path (Wang, 1999a):
    1 Deliver modernized, information- and knowledge-based, agricultural-management
    system concept to farmers through PA experiments to gradually convert existing
    empiric-based farming practices to information-based, modern agriculture. 2 Practice
    PA technologies in large-scale, government-run farms or experimental farms first.
    In rural areas, introduce pre-assembled, pre-proofed PA technique modules to farmers
    through extension services or social services, while accumulating experiences
    from PA experiments. Gradually expand the scale of PA applications as the farm
    sizes increase. 3 Extend the concept of PA into precision livestock husbandry,
    precision horticulture, precision post-processing, and precision management. 4
    Develop information- and knowledge-based technology modules to provide strong
    support to agriculture. These modules may include DGPS, GIS, sensors and data-acquisition
    systems for detecting spatial variability of soils and plants, yield monitors,
    yield mapping systems, precision water-saving irrigation systems, spot sprayers,
    animal identification systems, information-management and decision-support systems,
    and multi-media systems. References Adamsen et al., 2000 Adamsen, F.J., Barnes,

    Abstract Precision agriculture (PA) or precision farming (PF) has witnessed unprecedented
    growth in the last decade, especially in countries such as the United States,
    Germany, Canada, and others. While the rest of the world has been relatively slow
    in embracing precision agricultural practices, the change is coming. The chapter

    PDF 2.1 Components of Precision Agriculture Ever since the man appeared on the
    earth, he has been harnessing the natural resources to meet his basic requirements.
    The term “precision farming” describes the integration of GIS and GPS tools to
    provide an extensive amount of detailed information on crop growth, crop health,
    crop yield, water absorption, nutrient levels, topography, and soil variability
    (Adrian et al. 2005). It precisely establishes various operations, such as the
    best tillage, application of fertilizer, sowing, irrigation, harvesting, etc.,
    and turns traditional extensive production to intensive production according to
    space variable data. It not only utilize fully resources, reduce investment, decrease
    pollution of the environment, and get the most of social and economic efficiency
    but also makes farm products, the same as industry, become controllable and be
    produced in standards and batches (Khan 2013). Thus, specific objectives of precision
    agriculture are to increase profitability, increase production, reduce variable
    costs, reduce erosion, reduce the environmental impact of chemicals, track and
    monitor the use of chemicals, and manage large farms (Atherton et al. 1999; Olson
    1998). However, precision farming has been confined to developed countries. Land
    tenure system, smaller farm size (<1 ha), and crop diversity have limited the
    scope of precision farming in India. However, there is a wide scope for precision
    farming in irrigated/commercial/fruit and vegetable crops/high value crops. It
    is apparent that there is a tremendous scope for precision farming in India as
    well, and it is necessary to develop database of agriculture resources, which
    will act as decision support system at the farm (<1 ha) level. Generally, three
    major components of precision agriculture are information, technology, and management.
    Base on these three principles, we can define PA in different ways. Precision
    farming is information-intense. A lot of data are required to generate treatment
    maps, and many techniques are underdevelopment or have been developed during the
    last decade. Earlier, precision agriculture encompassed three “Rs”: the right
    time, the right amount, and the right place (Robert et al. 1994). Later, the International
    Plant Nutrition Institute added another “R” to that list, “the Right Source,”
    and more recently an additional “R,” the right manner, has also been proposed
    (Khosla 2008). Precision agriculture is a management strategy that uses information
    technologies to bring data from multiple sources to bear on decisions associated
    with crop production (National Research Council 1997). It allows for the management
    of spatial and temporal variability within a field, reduction of costs, improvement
    of yield quantity and quality, and reduction of environmental impacts. In other
    hand, PA can be defined as a set of technologies that have helped propel agriculture
    into the computerized information-based world and is designed to help farmers
    get greater control over the management of farm operations (Gandonou 2005). Precision
    farming is based on several separate technologies, yet interdependent parts, which
    together form the basis for individual management systems. Precision farming technology
    (PFT) is designed to provide information and data to assist farmers when making
    site-specific management (SSM) decisions. Demand for information about technologies
    to manage agricultural production systems increased with the advent of yield monitors
    and global positioning systems, etc., and improvements in computing power and
    data management (Swinton and Lowenberg-DeBoer 1998). The following section outlines
    the most prevalent systems that are used in PA. The key elements required for
    generation, dissemination, and adoption of precision farming techniques, therefore,
    include information, technology, and managements. Information is needed about
    crop characteristics, soil properties (topography, fertility status, texture,
    moisture content/retention, tillage needs, salinity, waterlogging, etc.), incidence
    of pests (insects, diseases, weeds, and others), weather/climatic conditions,
    other biotic and abiotic stresses, plant growth response, harvest and postharvest
    handling, marketing and market intelligence, socioeconomic conditions of farmers,
    etc. Detailed information, so collected, can be used to create different kinds
    of maps of the farms/villages/regions (e.g., different soil characteristics, groundwater,
    pest incidence, weed distribution, topography, environmental pollution, etc.)
    which can help the farmers in using the available information at each step while
    making site-specific decisions for performing different farm operations. Planners
    can use these maps for regulating the supplies of inputs in different areas. Technologies
    are rapidly evolving, and farmers must keep up with the changes that can help
    in increasing productivity and profitability. Use of remote sensing and geographic
    information system (GIS), auto-analysers, sensors, computers along with appropriate
    software, etc. can help in precisely identifying areas of nutrient deficiencies
    and other biotic and abiotic stresses, etc., and quantifying the quantification
    of the economic significance of the soil-water-fertilizer-pest-crop-related constraints
    and their environmental impacts at the farm/village/region levels. They can provide
    useful guidance for adopting the systems of integrated management of soil health,
    nutrients, pests, water, energy, and different crop genetic resources. By using
    sensors postharvest quality of the produce can be monitored and enhanced. Efficient
    management of the suite of technologies is of paramount importance. This will
    combine information obtained and the available technology into a comprehensive
    management system. Without proper management precision, crop production will not
    be possible. Farmers must know how to interpret available information, how to
    utilize the technology, and how to make sound production and decisions. The complexity
    of agriculture and diverse expertise needed for the development and dissemination
    of knowledge-intensive precision farming technologies require multidisciplinary
    efforts of agronomists, plant breeders, soil scientists, agro-meteorologists,
    entomologists, plant pathologists, weed scientists, biotechnologists, economists,
    extension workers, and farmers. Paradigm shifts are needed in the systems of generation,
    transfer, and adoption. Systems approach needs to be followed to integrate, synthesize,
    and process information, and develop computer-simulated crop production models.
    User-friendly computer software can in turn guide the farmers in making appropriate
    decisions for performing site-specific farm operations. User-oriented cost-effective
    technologies generated through such efforts will help in ensuring the adoption
    of precision farming technologies by the farmers. 2.2 Spatial Data Management
    Field is not one uniform unit. In principle, all parameters and farming practices
    can be a part of a site-specific resource management. 2.2.1 Geographical Positioning
    Precision farming, as we know it today, started in the late 1980s with the advent
    of the global positioning system (GPS) into the agricultural sector, when it was
    realized how much farming data were spatially related (Blackmore 2003). Geographical
    positioning with GPS or DGPS (differential GPS) is the “backbone” of most PF practices.
    It is essential for most site-specific practices that a specific action is recorded
    and positioned in order to use the information for future treatments. With a positioning
    system, it is possible to gather information site-specifically. The global positioning
    system (GPS) makes possible to record the in-field variability as geographically
    encoded data (Nemenyi et al. 2003). An alternative to the GPS system, the Russian
    GLONASS satellite system is developed, which in principle is similar to the GPS
    system and based on several satellites. The global positioning system (GPS) is
    one of the key technologies that make precision agriculture possible. GPS receivers
    with sufficient accuracy for yield mapping, grid sampling, variable rate application,
    and other precision activities are available at moderate cost. GPS receivers,
    which provide accurate, geo-referenced position information, are often used with
    combine yield monitors, scouting equipment, or variable rate application machinery
    (Stombaugh et al. 2002). Several factors, including the satellite and receiver
    clock limitations, ephemeris variation, satellite configuration, atmospheric interference,
    multipath, and selective availability (SA) can cause errors in GPS position information.
    The most common way to counteract GPS errors is by using differential GPS or DGPS.
    The differential global positioning system (DGPS) is an integration of space-based
    and ground-based segments that together comprise a radio-navigation facility (Shearer
    et al. 1999). In a DGPS system, a GPS receiver is placed at an accurately known
    location. This base station receiver will calculate GPS errors by comparing its
    actual location to the location computed from the GPS signals. This error information
    is sent to the rover receiver, which uses it to correct the position information
    it computes from the GPS signals. DGPS corrections can be broadcast by tower-based
    or satellite-based systems (Fig. 2.1). Fig. 2.1 DGPS tower-based (left) and satellite-based
    systems Full size image By using the geographical positioning system, it is possible
    to locate the information for further analysis and make a visual presentation
    in a GIS system. Precision farming provides a new solution using a systems approach
    for today’s agricultural issues such as the need to balance productivity with
    environmental concerns. It is based on advanced information technology. It includes
    describing and modeling variation in soils and plant species and integrating agricultural
    practices to meet site-specific requirements. It aims at increased economic returns,
    as well as at reducing the energy input and the environmental impact of agriculture.
    2.2.2 Geographical Information System In order to save your geographical position
    and site-specific field characteristics, it is an indispensable to have a geographical
    information system (GIS) platform to save and handle spatial information. The
    GIS created by computing background makes possible to generate complex view about
    our fields and to make valid agro-technological decisions. Most GIS systems are
    reliable but also fairly expensive depending on the features and capabilities
    of the program. A GIS is a set of computer tools that allows one to work with
    data that are tied to a particular location or spatially mapped area on the earth.
    A GIS is a database that is specifically designed to work with map data (Price
    2006). GIS is the merger of attribute and a geographic database. This allows for
    multiple detailed data to be graphically depicted on a map and utilized for decision-making.
    Farmers have long since utilized maps for data collection and decision-making.
    However, the difference with applying the advanced technology of GIS is that the
    GIS map exhibits “intelligence” where you can ask a question and get an answer.
    GIS technology application is influencing decision-making because it avoids the
    shortcomings of traditional maps, allows for the rapid computer analysis, and
    applies sophisticated data structures. GIS is used as a data synthesizing and
    decision-support tool in many fields (Mickle 2009). GIS is a spatial decision
    support system, not a decision-making system. A GIS software program enables the
    farmer to assemble and organize different sources of site-specific and geographical
    data information in various layers. Each layer in GIS is termed “coverage” and
    consisting of topologically linked geographic features and associated data. 2.2.3
    Remote Sensing Remote sensing is the science and art of acquiring information
    about the earth’s surface without actually coming in contact with it. This is
    done by recording energy, which is either reflected or emitted from the earth’s
    surface. The information recorded is then processed and analyzed, and the information
    is used to develop a prescription map that can be used in a variable rate application
    (Grisso et al. 2011). This technology can be used to obtain various layers of
    information about soil and crop conditions. It allows detection and/or characterization
    of an object, series of objects, or the landscape without having the sensor in
    physical contact with the soil. It uses aerial or satellite imaging to sense crop
    vegetation and identify crop stresses and injuries or pest infestation. So far
    satellite images have mainly been used to produce maps and predict yield potentials
    on large areas. With higher resolution and near-infrared and red sensing, it is
    possible to map the relative reflectance from the crop in a small scale. 2.3 Soil
    Sampling and Mapping A variety of different soils exist across any given field.
    Also, a field may contain a low level of one nutrient and a high level of another
    nutrient. Soil sampling and testing are the best ways to identify these differences
    and to adjust liming and fertilization practices. Both grid and directed sampling
    are used to describe soil properties for management of variable rates of fertility.
    Grid soil sampling involves sampling at points on a square grid throughout a field.
    An alternative to grid sampling is directed sampling, which involves dividing
    a field into regular or irregular management zones based on features such as soil
    type, topography, or past yield performance. In either system, collect at least
    five or six subsamples from each cell or zone and mix them into one sample container.
    The soil samples are collected from each section and then forwarded to a laboratory
    for analysis often guided by the advisory service. It is absolutely necessary
    to take care to assure that the soil sample you send to the laboratory accurately
    represents the area sampled (Thom et al. 1997). When soil fertility data is returned
    from the soil testing lab, you can enter the data into your mapping program to
    create fertility maps. Gathering of soil data from soil samples to create a soil
    map is a relatively expensive and time-consuming task but have also valuable information
    for later treatments with fertilizers and design of decision support systems.
    A soil analysis can identify some of the limiting factors regarding yield and
    growth potential for the specific crop on a specific spot in the field. Soil test
    results should be included in a record system for each production field on a farm,
    along with the amounts of lime and fertilizer applied each year, the crops grown,
    and the yields obtained. 2.4 Yield Monitoring and Mapping Yield monitors and maps
    form a very important part of a PF system. Yield monitors are a logical first
    step for those who want to begin practicing SSCM. The yield monitor which predicts
    yield from other variables is intended to give the user an accurate assessment
    of how yields vary within a field. With a yield monitor, a producer also can conduct
    on-farm variety trials or weed control evaluations without the need of a weigh
    wagon. Such on-farm comparisons help producers fine-tune crop production practices
    to their soils. Yield monitors are a combination of several components. They typically
    include several different sensors and other components, including a data storage
    device, user interface (display and key pad), and a task computer located in the
    combine cab, which controls the integration and interaction of these components.
    The sensors measure the mass or the volume of grain flow (grain flow sensors),
    separator speed, ground speed, grain moisture, and header height. The sensors
    are interfaced with both analog to digital and direct digital inputs. Yield is
    determined as a product of the various parameters being sensed (Shearer et al.
    1999). Grain volume flow sensor is prone to errors on slopes as the grain can
    slip to one side and block the beam. By adding slope sensors, this has been accounted
    for. Yield monitoring values can be exported to a personal computer and stored
    in nonvolatile memory for further analysis or printing via specialized software
    packages. Yield data were recorded and analyzed over 10 years, resulting in a
    rich data set for both spatial and temporal trend analysis 5. Variable-rate rechnology
    (VRT) is the equipment with the ability to change the application rate and mixture
    as it moves across the field. VRT adjust pesticide, herbicide, and seeding application
    rates to match soil potentials or problem areas (Adamchuck and Mulliken 2005).
    Roberts et al. (2001) reported that N losses to the environment were lower with
    VRT than with uniform rate application (URA), except on fields with little spatial
    variability and management information. 2.5 Differential Global Positioning System
    The differential global positioning system (DGPS) is an integration of space-
    and ground-based segments that together comprise a radio-navigation facility.
    Initially developed for national security interests, a portion of the DGPS system
    is available to civilian users (Fig. 2.2). When yield data are used with information
    generated by a DGPS receiver, a producer can generate yield maps that provide
    a quick visualization of crop performance within a particular crop production
    unit. Ultimately, any increased profit realized from incorporating a yield monitor
    into an operation will come from changes in management practices that result from
    the identification of problem areas using such yield maps. With DGPS, the benefits
    of using a yield monitor are even more evident (Shearer et al. 1999). Fig. 2.2

    and Technology The concept of PF has the potential of aiding farmers to use nutrients
    and chemicals in an efficient way according to crop needs at a given site on the
    field and thereby make farming more economically competitive and sustainable.
    Application (VRA) of nutrients has the potential to improve the specific crop
    quality in a number of rotations, for example, to obtain certain protein content
    in cereals, in particular wheat for bakery flour and barley for malting. Variable-rate
    technology (VRT) is the equipment with the ability to change the application rate
    and mixture as it moves across the field. VRT adjust pesticide, herbicide, and
    seeding application rates to match soil potentials or problem areas (Adamchuck
    and Mulliken 2005). Six main sources of errors of yield measurement that have
    been identified are unknown crop width entering the header during harvest, time
    lag of grain through the threshing mechanism, the inherent wandering error from
    the GPS, surging grain through the combine transport system, grain losses from
    the combine, and sensor accuracy and calibration (Blackmore and Marshall 1996).
    Yield mapping is one application of data analysis where the process of observation,
    interpretation, evaluation, and implementation can be applied. Yield mapping software
    can be purchased as a part of an overall investment in a combine harvester or
    separately. The two basic technologies for VRA are map-based and sensor-based.
    Map-based VRA adjusts the application rate based on an electronic map, also called
    a prescription map. Using the field position from a GPS receiver and a prescription
    map of desired rate, the concentration of input is changed as the applicator moves
    through the field. Canopy management can be conducted with a combination of crop
    sensors and real-time modeling. Sensor-based VRA requires no map or positioning
    system. Sensors on the applicator measure soil properties or crop characteristics
    “on the go.” Based on this continuous stream of information, a control system
    calculates the input needs of the soil or plants and transfers the information
    to a controller, which delivers the input to the location measured by the sensor
    (Grisso et al. 2011). 2.7 Section Control Precision agriculture technology has
    evolved in such a manner that it provides farmers with new and innovative ways
    to possibly improve profitability. One of these ways is a new approach to the
    application of liquid chemicals and other inputs known as automatic section control.
    Automatic section control on a sprayer has the ability to selectively manage input
    application across the spray boom. This technology utilizes a global positioning
    system (GPS) to locate the position of the sprayer within the field and then records
    the areas covered. If the sprayer traverses an area previously covered, it can
    automatically turn the appropriate section off, therefore eliminating over application.
    In addition, automatic section control can manage chemical application in undesirable
    areas such as point rows, waterways, and during headland turns. The largest benefit
    associated with automatic section control is the reduction in overlapped areas
    especially prevalent on irregular-shaped fields. As a result, this new technology
    has the potential to increase profits due to reducing input costs. Environmental
    benefits are also possible due to the ability to manage buffer zones and protect
    sensitive areas in and around the field. Furthermore, improved efficiency can
    occur if coupled with a navigational aide such as light bar or auto-steer (Shockley
    2010). Once a prototype was created and farm trials were conducted, Dillon et
    al. (2007) examined the economic implications of utilizing automatic section control.
    Mooney et al. (2009) conducted the most recent economic analysis, and determined
    automatic section control became profitable at input saving levels of 11% or above.
    2.8 Guidance Systems There are two classifications of guidance systems for agricultural
    production: guidance aides and autonomous systems. Guidance aides are devices
    that provide guidance information to the operator and still require the operator
    to fully control the machines operations. The intent of the autonomous system
    is to free up the operator of the machine from the guidance task and thus improve
    operating efficiency. 2.8.1 Guidance Aid The term guidance aide refers to devices
    that provide guidance information to the operator but do not attempt to replace
    the operator (Ima and Mann 2004). One of the most broadly adopted and more recently
    developed methods to reduce guidance error is the light bar technology. The main
    function of light bar is to assist the machine operator in driving, thus decreasing
    operator fatigue and minimizing application errors of overlaps and skips. Most
    light bar systems include a differential GPS (DGPS) receiver and antenna, some
    kind of computer or microprocessor, and a light bar or graphics display (Stombaugh
    2002). From the study of cost maps, Kayrouz (2008) indicated that inaccuracy of
    machinery movement, whether in the application stage or the harvesting stage,
    is very costly. Light bar gives a visual guide that changes colors as the operator
    veers off the desired path. Previous technologies were developed with the idea
    of achieving the same goal, for example, planter markers and foam markers. Both
    of these previous technologies are becoming shadowed by light bar and its effectiveness
    in improving farm profitability. As a result, foam and planter markers are becoming
    an obsolete technology (Kayrouz 2008). 2.8.2 Autonomous Field Machinery According
    to Haapala et al. (2006), as human capacity to handle simultaneous information
    is limited, new intelligence has been developed between the user and the system
    to be controlled. The intelligent layer decides which kind of information is passed
    on for the user and which part is used for other purposes. Introduction of small,
    light-weight robots that can perform agricultural tasks autonomously may prove
    to be a realistic option for farmers in the future. These robots will likely operate
    in fleets and utilize intelligent controls to cooperate with each other to perform
    tasks such as scouting for weeds and diseases, yield and field mapping, and plant-specific
    operations like sowing and fertilizing (Shockley 2010). The role of automation
    should be designed so that automation helps the individual user to simultaneously
    avoid stress and increase efficiency of work. 2.9 Conclusions Precision farming
    is still only a concept in many developing countries, and strategic support from
    the public and private sectors is essential to promote its rapid adoption. Successful
    adoption, however, comprises at least three phases including exploration, analysis,
    and execution. Precision agriculture can address both economic and environmental
    issues that surround production agriculture today. Questions remain about cost-effectiveness
    and the most effective ways to use the technological tools we now have, but the
    concept of “doing the right thing in the right place at the right time” has a
    strong intuitive appeal. In the light of today’s urgent need, there should be
    an all-out effort to use new technological inputs to make the “Green Revolution”
    as an “Evergreen Revolution.” Ultimately, the success of precision agriculture
    depends largely on how well and how quickly the knowledge needed to guide the
    new technologies can be found. References Adamchuck, V. I., & Mulliken, J. (2005).

    of Things to the Internet of Food: The EU Epistemology of “Ethically-Related Science”
    Coined by Kevin Ashton, the British technology pioneer and cofounder of Auto-ID
    Center at MIT, the term “Internet of Things” (IoT) (Ashton 2009) is nowadays definitely
    a reality, where the physical (like furniture and appliances) and the virtual
    (software applications and databases) words converge in the creation of a plethora
    of smart objects and devices wirelessly connected to the web. This internet-like
    structure allows the user to remotely control wearable computing, quantified-self
    technology and smart homes, going beyond machine-to-machine communications, thus
    generating efficiency, accuracy and economic benefits for society (ITU 2013).
    Yet the capacity the IoT possesses to augment the reality through an inextricable
    mixture of hardware, software and services is increasingly becoming the engine
    for a revolutionary rethinking of data and information gathering and sharing (EC
    2016a). Categorized into data-carrying, data-capturing, sensing and actuating
    devices, the IoT ecosystem includes characteristics spanning from interconnectivity
    to heterogeneity to things-related services, so as to create a new class of cyber-physical
    systems capable of both affecting every aspect of individual and social human
    life (ITU 2013) and of completely reshaping each field of application (Peppet
    2014). The European Commission (EC)’s Digitisation (2016b) and Standardisation
    Communications (2016c) highlight the importance of Europe in becoming a leading
    region in IoT products and applications, so thus “improving the way we collectively
    and individually function, upgrading our slow, obsolete and ‘un-smart’ life sustaining
    processes through technoscientific innovation” (Benessia and Pereira 2015, 80).
    Inevitably, in this prospect of stability and control, the transformative fusion
    of the physical world with ICT technology raises myriad concerns at the policy
    level, ranging from semantic interoperability and standardization activities to
    data protection and liability issues (EC 2016a). In the face of these aspects,
    ethics turns out to be the joining link between the institutional approach to
    tackle them and the role played by the citizenry along the on-going process of
    ‘social digitalization.’ ICT ethics is increasingly being istitutionalised, becoming
    a sort of “indicator of normativity,” namely a policy flexible tool similar to
    a soft law instrument in establishing unenforceable, voluntary conduct, while
    simultaneously making the governance of the IoT more legitimate—ethically and
    democratically (IERC 2015, 23 ss.). In the late 1980s, indeed, during Europe’s
    transition from an economic to a political entity and in the context of the rise
    of biotechnology, the EU ‘regulatory law,’ that is legal regulation instrumental
    of particular economic or social policy ends, shifted to ‘ethics’ to create the
    idea of the EU citizenry (Tallacchini 2009). Through the establishment, in 1991,
    of the Group of Advisers on the Ethical Implications of Biotechnology (GAEIB)—replaced
    in 1997 by The European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies (EGE)—the
    Commission’s intention was to detect and define the ethical aspects concerning
    genetic manipulation, in addition to assessing its impact on society, as well
    as to ensure that citizens were adequately informed. The establishment of an ethical
    committee, whose activity was qualified as ‘expert advice,’ was a clear attempt
    to include an indirect public commitment in the framework of the EU policy procedures,
    in order to contribute to and achieve a fruitful development of biotechnological
    products within the market (CEC 1991, 16). Nonetheless, the institutionalization
    of ethics aimed at integrating science, innovation and social interests to increase
    the role of civil society in the political EU, turned out to be problematic. Despite
    the implementation of cultural, ethical and social values in decision-making processes,
    the Committees have imposed themselves on the community—instead of opening up
    a civic dialogue—through a top-down approach which has pervaded and legitimized
    scientific knowledge, in the name of that moral integrity always recognized to
    scientists from the beginning of modern age. Citizens’ role has been relegated
    to that of mere recipients of EU ethics, ‘adequately informed,’ though without
    any active involvement in the choice of values to implement in public decisions
    (Tallacchini 2009, 2015). Today, in the face of the current EU strategies fostering
    ICT technology, the EU epistemology of “ethically-related science” (Tallacchini
    2015) has been acquiring new peculiar contours. Especially in innovative fields—such
    as the IoT—ethics has been unveiling a specific meaning, by coping with a commitment
    towards human agency and for the integration between technical and human dimensions
    (IERC 2015, 23 ss). This contribution deals with the ethical challenges arising
    from the IoT landscape with reference to a specific context, i.e. the realm of
    agri-food. In this sector, innumerable web-connected tools, platforms and sensors
    are constantly interacting with consumers/users/citizens, by reshaping and redefining
    the core elements and functions of machine-human being relationships. By highlighting
    the panoply of opportunities and purposes presented by the rise of the so-called
    Internet of Food (IoF), this paper outlines how the loci of ethics are constantly
    and profoundly being rethought, distributed and extended along every step of the
    food chain, so as to provide food actors with new roles and empowering tools,
    together with unexplored forms of responsibilities. By sketching out the main
    pillars which ethics of IoF is founded on, my argument posits that the civic hybridization
    of knowledge production mediated by IoT technologies may create breeding ground
    for the move towards an ‘ethical in-design’ approach to the IoF-driven smart systems.
    Namely, information flows coming from and surrounding cyberspace might strongly
    contribute to building miscellaneous digital spaces of public engagement in relation
    to food issues, where consumers/users/citizens become endowed with the right to
    explore and ‘build’ ethics of the emerging IoT, in pursuit of values and norms
    debated, shared and accepted in more transparent and democratic ways. The Internet
    of Food Architecture: Outlook and Concerns In the ever-changing and ever-evolving
    realm of agri-food, the inter-networking of smart things is gradually giving birth
    to a peculiar and fascinating scenario, i.e. the Internet of Food (IoF hereby).
    Though a general accepted definition of the latter does not exist yet, given its
    infancy and the difficulty of defining something that continually and rapidly
    changes and transforms, the IoF concept usually refers to a sophisticated vision
    of the food sector brimming with communicating sensors and digital services and
    devices through which to empower citizens’ food choices and habits (Frey et al.
    2016). It is a highly sensorised world in which a spectrum of all-knowing things
    and value-added services are being used to “enable all known information about
    every food ingredient and product to be accessed by machines, consumers, and companies”
    (Elgan 2016). This promising frontier in food technology has been attracting the
    interest of food players due to its potential to entirely rethink the relationship
    among institutions, industries and the citizenship. Ranging from precision agriculture
    to agri-food logistics to “food awareness” (Lehmann et al. 2012), the IoF landscape
    is likely to “define the lingua franca enabling both agriculture and food to be
    more traceable, transparent and trustworthy” (Trice 2016), by drawing aid from
    machine learning and artificial intelligence. In the flourishing digital farming
    sector, in particular, IoT technologies (such as cloud computing, drones, sensors,
    global positioning systems) allow users to collect weather data, map crop yields,
    track seed varieties, analyze nutrient applications and, at the same time, share
    all captured data and interpret them with big-data techniques (EU-SCAR 2016; EPRS-STOA
    2016). In this vein, internet connectivity represents the virtual nexus through
    which to create added-value integrated services spanning from pest identification
    systems to ‘smart aquaponics’ gardens, from alert systems to sensors tracking
    dairy cows, helping farmers spot illnesses earlier (Chen et al. 2014). As for
    the monitoring of the food chain, examples encompass pervasive low-cost technology
    for the scrutiny of power usage, 3D printing of pasta, chocolate or cakes, sensor-enhanced
    hardware and connected smartphone apps to automate much of the brewing process,
    handheld spectrometers scanning every sort of food product (Frey et al. 2016).
    This innovative ICT-based picture is being more and more enriched by initiatives
    of “food awareness,” aimed at indexing all pre-made food products in a comprehensive
    genomic database (so as to provide a precise molecular view of food), at applying
    genomics and analytics techniques to mitigate food borne illness and other risks
    in food management, as well as at using DNA testing to optimize individual diets
    and give lifestyle advice (Elgan 2016). With this scenario in mind, the process
    is intuitive as at the baseline of this large-scale food ambient stands a cascade
    of bits and bytes combined and integrated with each other to give more accurate
    and precise food information, together with the goal of enhancing and guaranteeing
    food safety within the realms of processing and manufacturing. However, the heterogeneity
    of data coming from the ever-expanding IoT enabled objects is posing novel intricate
    dilemmas to deal with, classifiable into three major categories: the technical
    problems pertaining to the legibility of the data, the economic aspects related
    to companies’ market competitiveness and information power, and the legal issues
    arising from data usage and data ownership. The first question pertains to the
    ability of reading the data in the formats they are presented in. The importance
    of this aspect is inherent to both the data’s value and its potential for improving
    products and services and/or creating new ones. Therefore there is a need for
    both technical standards that are easily understandable and applicable, as well
    as rules, guidelines and best practices that can address—according to reliability
    and transparency—the techniques of algorithms processing, data mining, data fusion
    and information integration. To this end, semantic frameworks containing machine-readable
    annotations (ontology) about food have been studied (Boulos et al. 2015) to design
    information platforms capable of offering intelligent, personalised and context-sensitive
    dietary recommendations, as well as appropriate levels of traceability and transparency.
    As regards the economic subject, profiling and targeting are becoming more and
    more the corner stones of the modalities through which companies learn about and
    measure every aspect of citizen’s lives. Gathering and combining data about, for
    instance, calories burned or food bought online, allow industry to gain real-time
    and hyper-personal insights into individual consumers’ preferences and behaviors,
    so as to target them individually and specifically (Helberger 2016). The deriving
    image of the “profiled consumer” clearly explains companies’ interests in maintaining
    their informational power for the purposes of both marketing strategies and detention
    of competitive power on the market (Eskens 2016). Such information asymmetries,
    however, and their consequences in terms of economic advantages are likely to
    trigger dangerous forms of social control (Mantelero 2012), inevitably conflicting
    with the divergent citizens’ requests for freely accessible, machine-readable
    and re-usable data (food-related data included). This matter, moreover, goes hand
    in hand with the third issue mentioned above, that is privacy and data protection
    concerns, affecting every aspect of the agri-food sector. In the farm sector,
    characterised by numerous SMEs combined with a limited number of conglomerates
    like Monsanto and DuPont, farmers’ concerns firstly deal with both the access
    from government officials to private information without explicit permission,
    and the secondary and tertiary uses of the data. Further fears concern the confidentiality
    underpinning some farm information, as well as the possible misuse of the data
    related to particular farming techniques as akin to trade secrets (Ellixson and
    Griffin 2016). With reference to collecting food safety data, Chaves and Kerschbaum
    (2008) have highlighted producers’ worries about their industrial privacy when
    using Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) attached to items, due to the possible
    use of the information on the RFID tag by competitors to gain insight into the
    supply chain. Besides, as far as genetic information usage is concerned, the problem
    lies in processing sensitive data collected through databases and smart devices
    equipped to interact with other smart items and users, but also traders and third
    parties (insurance companies, governments, advertisers, among others). All these
    examples clearly mirror the challenges faced by the networked system architecture
    of the IoF, so as to call for an ethical approach—together with well defined legal
    rules—able to combine technoscientific innovation with citizens’ right to food
    information, meant both as a ‘normative tool’ for transparency and access to information,
    and as an inalienable and participatory right to using, controlling and sharing
    their own data. At the international level, the Mauritius Declaration on the IoT
    adopted in October 2014 made transparency the key concept which privacy policies
    addressing the IoT ecosystem and its derived big data should be based on. With
    more information being produced, shared and repurposed than ever before, “those
    who offer internet of things devices”—it affirms—“should be clear about what data
    they collect, for what purposes and how long this data is retained,” by eliminating
    the out-of context surprises for customers. How can this vision be implemented
    in the current EU food policy agenda? Governing the Web-Connected Agri-Food Sector
    Through Ethics and Food Law Given the specific characteristics of the IoT, such
    as ubiquity, smartness and connectedness, the EU has adopted a proactive approach
    to the IoT vision since 2009, looking at the concepts of trust, acceptance and
    security as the driving force to make the IoT system an “Internet of Things for
    people” (CEC 2009). The following year, after the European Parliament’s Resolution
    calling on the Commission to set up, inter alia, a panel of experts to propose
    an ethical framework for the development of IoT applications (EP 2010, point 14),
    a multi-stakeholder expert working group (IoT-EG) was formed to advise the EC
    on the core issues related to the emerging IoT. In the framework of its last work
    carried out in 2012, the IoT-EG discussed six key ethical issues (social justice,
    trust, the blurring of contexts, non-neutrality of IoT metaphors, agency and autonomy)
    to describe the connection of ICT technology to moral and social issues. This
    analysis led to a number of policy objectives aimed at steering the IoT development
    in the desired direction. Among them, the Group suggested: a fair access to IoT
    technology and the qualification of citizens to make use of it; the protection
    of personal data, ensured privacy and usable security management; the option to
    make the otherwise invisible IoT technology visible for inspection purposes. Besides,
    because of the analogies and metaphors through which the IoT is being embedded
    in living spaces, the Group stressed the need that the actions being taken by
    IoT technology are actually intended by its users, and that profiling algorithms
    are morally proper and subject to continuous monitoring and assessment procedures
    (IoT-EG 2012). Certainly, this analysis has put forward a great many ethical challenges
    to investigate in depth, though intricate to face. From a legal stance, the recent
    adoption of Regulation No 2016/679 (the General Data Protection Regulation or
    GDPR) has taken a big step in the current EU legislative framework on data protection
    to meet the above mentioned recommendations. Having embedded provisions spanning
    from profiling to the right to be forgotten, from data protection by design and
    by default to the right to data portability, from security to the data protection
    officer, the new GDPR represents a detailed legal elaboration of Article 8 of
    the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU on personal data protection (the Charter
    2012). Yet this special protection recognized by Regulation to the citizen-user
    symbolizes the will to reaffirm the worth of individuals within the automated
    digital processes. With reference to the food sector, moreover, further legal
    rules can be added to this picture. Since ICT became an instrument in European
    hands through which to build an information society for all (EC 2002), in order
    to make information technologies as widespread as possible, in the food sector
    the goal coincided with the will to protect human health, by guaranteeing the
    safety of food products placed in the market. With the adoption of General Food
    Law (Regulation No 178/2002), indeed, food information has been deemed more by
    its capacity to guarantee food safety than to allow consumers to take informed
    choices in the market (Leone 2014). In General Food Law—whose aim is to provide
    “the basis for the assurance of a high level of protection of human health and
    consumers’ interest in relation to food” (Article 1)—the citizen appears as the
    consumer to be protected against health risks. Consequently, information, rather
    than working as medium of economic transactions (Articles 8 and 16), constitutes
    mostly one of the tools helping to determine whether any food is unsafe (Article
    14). Presently, with the advent of the new Regulation on labelling No 1169/2011,
    the EU legislator has given general attention to food information and communication,
    with the objective of contributing significantly to the health and well-being
    of citizens (and to their social and economic interests), whilst ensuring the
    smooth functioning of the internal market. On the one hand, Recital 23 empowers
    “the Commission to enable certain particulars to be made available through alternative
    means,” so as to enlarge the right of consumers to food information. On the other
    hand, Article 2 para. 2 lett. a) expands the notion of “food information,” by
    going beyond labeling and “including modern technology tools,” thus drawing upon
    ICT means and devices to take advantage of their full power of knowledge. In this
    way, food players have been allowed to build new food products and services closer
    to their interests and goals, and have been empowered at the same time by protecting
    their own rights and expectations. What seems to be lacking, however, is the attribution
    to citizens of an active role in embedding their own values and needs in ‘artifacts,’
    thus to entrusting and enabling them with degrees of power and control over technology
    itself. Yet the last recommendation given by the IoT-EG (2012) shed light on the
    necessity to make the ethical debate on the IoT experienced by the European citizenry,
    without confining it merely to corporate initiatives. Though the EGE has emphasized
    the application of participatory models solely to political participation (EGE
    2012, 63), the need to balance—with regard to the ethical aspects of the IoT—top-down
    Internet governance by governmental agencies with bottom-up participatory approaches
    by the Internet community has been stressed by the RAND Europe, a nonprofit institution
    which the EC contracted with to help improve the EU policy on the IoT. Having
    investigated ethical tensions arising from the newness brought about by the IoT—especially
    in relation to privacy, autonomy, trust, identity and social inclusion—the Corporation
    has proposed improving social inclusion by removing barriers to participation
    (RAND 2013, 80). In this sense, it has recommended a soft law approach to boost
    broad-based participation and competition capable of balancing potentially divergent
    objectives. “Helpful in this respect”—the RAND alleged—“would be a ‘sandbox’ initiative
    in which commercial, public sector and civil society stakeholders could ‘play’
    with different arrangements in an environment that is (by design) trusted, secure
    and capable of capturing innovations” (Ibidem, 127). Moreover, it advocated an
    ethical charter to both safeguard consumers’ interests in IoT environments and
    offer guidance to developers of IoT services (Ibidem, 128). Tackling this matter
    of concerns has thus strengthened the pre-existing idea to integrate normativity
    into information and communication solutions (EDPS 2010; EC 2012; EGE 2012; WP29
    2014; IERC 2015), so as to embrace a sort of “by-design approach” (Cavoukian 2012)
    to automatically protect individual rights and security. Generally speaking, by-design
    normativity consists of mechanisms embedded within the design and architecture
    of IT systems and business practices, from the very early design stage, right
    through to their ultimate deployment, use and ultimate disposal. It follows that
    ethics and law by-design can be understood as privileged forms of protection,
    namely specific normative orientations and regulatory principles in themselves,
    aimed at reducing individual users’ burden in dealing with ICT technology (Pereira
    and Tallacchini 2014, 14). However, as privacy is a complex concept dealing not
    only with different aspects of human personality, but also with a multiplicity
    of individual, collective and cultural sensibilities—even more evident in the
    agri-food domain—the perspective of replacing norms and rules with technology
    needs to face ethical and pragmatic considerations. Given the numerous practical
    problems concerning the use of the informed consent (Barocas and Nissenbaum 2009)—though
    its legal relevance is expressly recognised by Article 8 (2) of the Charter—the
    proper functioning of data protection tools cannot be separated from establishing
    and implementing certain related rights, and enabling people to use them. As said
    before, rather than ‘nudging’ Internet users towards reaching established ends,
    the vast arena of public and private actors (including authorities, policymakers,
    industry, civil society organizations, users and communities) should interact
    with and intervene in ICT orientation, in order to define the relevant values
    and rights to embed in the IoT infrastructure. To this end, a last significant
    question for our analysis comes out: how to engage the EU citizenry in building
    the IoF environment as a more knowledgeable and participatory fabric of connections
    between humans and smart things? The Challenging Move Towards an ‘In-Design Ethical
    Approach’ to the IoF With regard to the adoption of plausible remedies designed
    to cope with and overcome the ethical dilemmas deriving from ICT, Mortier et al.
    (2016) have identified in the three concepts of “legibility, agency and negotiability”
    the key elements that should structure any discussion concerning human-data interaction
    (HDI). By referring to transparency, control and the socio-legal framework of
    data and analytics algorithms respectively, the concepts included in the HID agenda
    have been put forth to open up a constructive dialogue among parties in ICT ecosystems.
    With this vision in mind, the concept of “ethical design” (Baldini et al. 2016)
    appears effectively suitable, from an engineering point of view, for extending,
    deepening, and strengthening the HID vision. This peculiar form of ethics prompts
    users to process digital architectures as collaborative design, in an attempt
    to open up civic spaces for reflection and decision with respect to certain regulatory
    choices to entrust to citizens. In this new ‘epistemic and engineering model,’
    “values are neither imposed nor pre-identified,” since “they are proposed and
    framed as an individual right of choice in the ICT architecture” (Ibidem). Ethical
    design, indeed, does not only affect the level and modalities of protection of
    private life and data, but extends to the possibility of guaranteeing individuals’
    access to their own raw data stored on the web, of providing pledges of visibility
    and transparency on information processes, as well as of interoperability between
    systems and devices (for example in the field of wearable sensors for the measurement
    of biological and physiological functions). To design an ethical blueprint for
    the IoF architecture, we intend to echo the concept of “ethical design” and coalesce
    it with the framework proposed, at the normative level, by Richards and King (2014)
    as regards the paradigm of big data. The authors have suggested the development
    of a “big data ethics” as a set of four principles (privacy, confidentiality,
    transparency and identity) called to govern data flows in our information society,
    and inform the establishment of big data norms. Following and mixing these two
    lines of reasoning, we propose an ‘ethical in-design approach’ to the IoF (Fig.
    1), meant as form of educational and social learning of the contexts and modalities
    in which the IoF architecture is constructed and framed. With the intention of
    balancing human values with the potential uses of large amounts of data, the proposed
    ethical framework of norms and rights focuses on the pillars of privacy, transparency,
    education, negotiability, agency and responsibility designed to protectively govern
    data flows in the agri-food sphere, as well as to safeguard the freedom of individual
    and collective food habits and choices, while enabling citizens to exercise their
    legitimate rights. Fig. 1 The Internet of Food ethics in-design Full size image
    Privacy as a ‘Context-Driven Right’ Our surely imperfect but hopeful ethical perspective
    leads us, firstly, to reshape the concept of privacy, understood no more as mere
    protective tool designed and controlled elsewhere by third subjects, but—borrowing
    Helen Nissenbaum’s work (2015)—as ‘context-driven right.’ This means taking privacy
    to be the requirement that personal information is compliant with informational
    norms, which prescribe that information flows according to key actors (i.e. recipients,
    information subjects and senders), types of information and constraints surrounding
    it. In the precision farming context, for example, informational norms govern
    flows between and about individuals in their context-specific capacities, such
    as farmers, agricultural retailers, farm consultants, machinery manufacturers,
    software producers and so forth. Farm information encompasses a cornucopia of
    different types of data, such as agronomic, financial, metrological, machine and
    staff data. And among concerns, protecting the ownership of farm data currently
    constitutes a prominent constraint on the terms of the contractual arrangements
    (COPA-COGECA 2016). This is because the IoF omnipresence blurs the boundaries
    between the public and private sphere, by sending the data collected, registered
    and shared through the IoT network anyway, thus affecting reliability of both
    the data and the devices involved in their processing (AIOTI 2015, 25). Opening
    Agri-Food Related Data for Transparent and More Trusted Relations The pillar of
    ‘transparency’ calls for the development of more trustworthy relations between
    food actors and smart things, based on openness and awareness towards data flows
    and data usage. To this end, it is worth mentioning the significant steps taken
    so far by so-called “open data movement,” phenomenon strictly linked to the ICT
    revolution and aimed at making data freely accessible, re-usable and modifiable
    by anyone for any purpose. Though the EC framed Open Data in terms of data-driven
    economy, through which to pursue business and economic opportunities, as well
    as to create new products and services (EC 2011), Open Data is likely to play
    a crucial role in unleashing new modalities of food-related knowledge production
    (GODAN 2015). In this regard, the Open Food Facts database, together with the
    activities and initiatives undertaken by EuroFIR AISBL, Lichfield District Council
    and Nesta, represent well-developed examples of citizens-led and technology-based
    projects, which reflect the tendency towards making citizens aware of, and exert,
    their own rights, by enhancing and strengthening access to food information—and
    consumer protection, as a consequence (Leone 2015). Educational Measures to ‘Negotiate’
    Knowledge Embracing and building the IoF ethics in-design into policy and law-making
    will require, thirdly, novel advanced educational measures, aimed at building
    collective transdisciplinary knowledge of the relationships between technology
    and normativity, as well as to overcome the huge social problem of the digital
    and knowledge divide. And it would allow for discussion and control over all the
    normative choices implicitly black-boxed and hidden in IoF applications and devices,
    so as to guarantee flexibility and adaptive capacity in ‘negotiating’ the development,
    production and sharing of socially robust food-related knowledge. For instance,
    the Committee of Professional Agricultural Organisations (COPA) and the General
    Confederation of Agricultural Cooperatives (COGECA) have expressed their own views
    on the principles that should underpin the collection, use and exchange of agricultural
    data. By calling for both the recognition of the farmers’ right to benefit from
    and be compensated for the use of farm data, and the need to grant the farmer
    a leading role in controlling the access to and use of data from his/her farm,
    the two associations have made transparency, simplicity and trust the main elements
    to ensure within the contracts on agricultural technologies (COPA-COGECA 2016).
    Citizens Acting as Creative and Empowered Subjects As a penultimate column of
    our ethical approach, the concept of ‘agency’ alludes to the capacity for human
    beings to act as subjects instead of deterministic mechanisms (Arendt 1958). It
    acquires an ethical dimension “when the intentionality of delegated actions is
    not fully controllable by the user, does not identify with the user’s identity
    and compromises his/her integrity, autonomy and eventually his/her freedom” (Pereira
    et al. 2013, 42–43). In this sense, a full concept of humanness arises, calling
    for the urge to let human agents behave intentionally and responsibly. Benessia
    and Pereira (2015) have represented the dream of the IoT as the deus ex machina
    consisting of a spectrum of machines, sensors and computing devices able to express
    what we—meaning us and our machines—want, can and need to pursue through it. Tackling
    paradoxes and human costs arising from these narratives of IoT enhancement implies
    the need to prevent human agents from behaving merely as “actants” (IERC 2015,
    30), namely as “passive users” (Benessia and Pereira 2015, 88) relying on implicit
    values and “hostages of technology” (EC 2016a, 27) being monitored by structured
    binary information, in lieu thereof of intentional subject acting responsibly
    and conceiving helpful and creative knowledge. Here, we refer to ‘agency’ as an
    umbrella term including the concepts of virtual identity, autonomy and self-reflexivity,
    so as to undermine the ICT technology’s digital architectures and to trigger forms
    of cooperation and collaboration in which integrity, consciousness and intentionality
    are preferred and preserved by impoverishment (IERC 2015, 29). The rethinking
    of normative practices related to technical innovation along this line of reasoning
    would give rise to significant spaces for reflection and decision-making at the
    intersection between knowledge and normativity, capable of going beyond the delegation
    of human autonomy to IoF applications. Responsibility as Both “RRI” and “Culture
    of Accountability” The last founding stone for building an IoF ethics in-design
    rests on the robust concept of ‘responsibility.’ While the EC is at work to enhance
    legal certainty with regard to liability (contractual and extra-contractual) in
    the IoT context (EC 2016a, 2017), here we link the term ‘responsibility’ to both
    the “Responsible Research and Innovation” (Von Schomberg and Davies 2010) credo
    and the issues pertaining to the Nissenbaum’s analysis on accountability. In today’s
    “Innovation Union,” that is the flagship initiative promoted by the EU institutions
    to address technoscientific innovation (EC 2010), responsibility has been rethought
    and construed in terms of co-responsibility of individuals in relation to emerging
    technologies (nano and synbio, in particular). From here, the expression ‘responsible
    innovation’ is widely used to spur—within research activities—interactive and
    transparent processes in which social actors and innovators are mutually responsible,
    taking into account ethical acceptability, sustainability and public desirability
    of innovation processes and their market products, in order to implement and foster
    technoscientific progress. This multifaceted framework might be applied to promote
    IoF infrastructures to enable food players and end-users to gain a clear understanding
    of their actions’ outcomes, evaluate them in terms of their social needs and moral
    values (justice, autonomy, security, sustainability, democracy and efficiency),
    and use these hints for the promotion of responsible research within the web-connected
    agri-food domain. As for the “culture of accountability,” the reference is to
    the need to create a particular kind of organizational context, in which answerability
    works to entice people to pay greater attention to system safety, reliability
    and sound design (Nissenbaum 1997). Applied to the realm of food, this vision
    would entail, first defining corporations’, stakeholders’ and citizens’ values
    and needs and, then, comprehending how these values can be morally discussed and
    debated, so as to assign and take up normative decisions and actions complying
    with them. Examples range from offering suitable mechanisms that put a fair level
    of data control back in the hands of users/citizens, to clarifying the reasons
    why and the ways through which food and farm data are being collected, stored
    and used. Thus conceived, this ethical framework may contribute to revitalising
    and reinvigorating the food-related ICT-led interactions among companies, consumers/citizens
    and IoT technology suppliers, by both making normativity inscribed in artifacts
    explicit and transparent and opening rooms of debate and deliberation that include
    citizens’ knowledge and engagement before and during the design phase. Some Conclusive
    Thoughts Since the IoF gained momentum in the agri-food domain, ICT-mediated objects
    have been nurturing pervasive and ubiquitous initiatives of knowledge production
    and data sharing. The vast realm of IoF systems, platforms and sensors are about
    to drastically rethink and reshape the agri-food sector as a whole in miscellaneous
    ways: by keeping constant tabs on the condition and quality of produced, transported
    and stored food products; by monitoring production conditions, shipping time and
    temperature; by capturing and managing every stage of the food chain delivery
    process (AIOTI 2015; Andrews 2015). Perceptions and perspectives on this revolution
    are so promising that scholarly work (SMART ACTION 2015, 17) has highlighted that
    the IoF applications might represent a valid means in pursuit of some of the Millennium
    Development Goals—established following the Millennium Summit of the United Nations
    in 2000—especially in reaching more sustainable food production and agricultural
    systems. In this overall framework, what is at stake with ICT technology—as with
    any complex technological revolution—is the consequence the IoT may have on society
    at large. Within the wide food policy context which IoF devices are embedded in,
    the need to achieve the right mix of security and flexibility calls for IoF developments
    to be regulated and trusted, which inevitably entails a thorough scrutiny of moral
    values and ethical issues. In facing potentially disruptive IoT-led ramifications,
    normative debates (WP29 2014, 3) have endorsed the necessity to keep citizens
    free, safe and well informed, in order to support trust and success of products
    and services on the market. Translated to the area of agri-food, these requests
    ask that clear rules on data usage and data ownership be defined so as to favour
    adoption of IoF solutions in smart farming and food value chain. Along this way
    from labs to markets, however, the sole reference to the need of both making citizens
    well informed about their data and adopting data protection rules may reduce normative
    issues to mere technical aspects, as such to be solved in terms of feasibility
    and economic efficiency, risk mitigation and public acceptance (Benessia and Funtowicz
    2016, 106). The democratic and participatory hallmark inherent to our proposed
    ethical approach to the IoF aims, instead, to deconstruct the ‘environments’ where
    innovation originates and develops, by screening and scrutinizing the values that
    permeate and define them. In this sense, ‘IoF ethics in-design’ might give word
    to all food actors involved in the value chain, by combining the individual dimension
    with the collective one, the protection of each subject with the active exercise
    of his/her rights, everyone’s own knowledge with the general interests belonging
    to the community. In his recent (2017) open letter marking the 28th anniversary
    of the worldwide web, Timothy Berners-Lee stressed three pernicious trends to
    urgently tackle in order to release digital knowledge’s potential arising from
    the net: lost control of personal data, spread of misinformation on the web, and
    political advertising used in ‘unethical ways.’ In looking at algorithmic transparency,
    the adoption of a set of common principles to be followed, and a tighter regulation
    of online political advertising as possible solutions to be considered and implemented,
    he has placed his trust in knowledge and creativity unleashing by everyone’s contribution
    and engagement. In the wake of these hopes and desires for the web’s future, the
    inclusion of ethical attributes in IoF ‘enchanted objects’ may feed the roots
    to give participatory rights a normative status, while enhancing and strengthening
    the digital relations between ICT innovation and the EU ‘food citizenry.’ References

    Abstract: Climate change is emerging as a major threat to farming, food security\
    \ and the livelihoods\nof millions of people across the world. Agriculture is\
    \ strongly affected by climate change due to\nincreasing temperatures, water shortage,\
    \ heavy rainfall and variations in the frequency and intensity\nof excessive climatic\
    \ events such as ﬂoods and droughts. Farmers need to adapt to climate change by\n\
    developing advanced and sophisticated farming systems instead of simply farming\
    \ at lower intensity\nand occupying more land. Integrated agricultural systems\
    \ constitute a promising solution, as they can\nlower reliance on external inputs,\
    \ enhance nutrient cycling and increase natural resource use efﬁciency.\nIn this\
    \ context, the concept of Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA) emerged as a promising\
    \ solution to\nsecure the resources for the growing world population under climate\
    \ change conditions. This work\nproposes a CSA architecture for fostering and\
    \ supporting integrated agricultural systems, such as\nMixed Farming Systems (MFS),\
    \ by facilitating the design, the deployment and the management of\ncrop–livestock-=forestry\
    \ combinations towards sustainable, efﬁcient and climate resilient agricultural\n\
    systems. Propelled by cutting-edge technology solutions in data collection and\
    \ processing, along\nwith fully autonomous monitoring systems, e.g., smart sensors\
    \ and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs),\nthe proposed architecture called MiFarm-CSA,\
    \ aims to foster core interactions among animals, forests\nand crops, while mitigating\
    \ the high complexity of these interactions, through a novel conceptual\nframework.\n\

    \ Introduction\nStarvation is one of the biggest threats we are facing as humanity\
    \ in the 21st century.\nThe global demand for food is increasing, with recent\
    \ studies forecasting that the global\npopulation will reach 9.5 billion people\
    \ by 2050 [1], and more than 80% of available land\nis already cultivated [2].\
    \ Global demand for farming products is expected to increase\nby 70% for food\
    \ production [3] and double for livestock products by 2050 [4]. However,\nagricultural\
    \ production is strongly affected by the changes in climate conditions, such as\n\
    rising temperatures [5], changing rainfall regimes [6] and variations in the frequency\
    \ and\nintensity of extreme climatic events such as ﬂoods and droughts [7]. The\
    \ estimated impacts\nof the climate change indicates that the yield loss could\
    \ be up to 35% for rice, 20% for\nwheat, 50% for sorghum, 13% for barley and 60%\
    \ for maize [8], and livestock production\nwill be also negatively affected [4].\n\
    Both farmers and breeders need to ﬁnd efﬁcient and affordable methods in order\
    \ to\nstrengthen the resilience of agriculture and livestock farming against climate\
    \ change. The\nTelecom 2021, 2, 52–74. https://doi.org/10.3390/telecom2010005\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/telecom\nTelecom 2021, 2\n53\nconcept of Climate-Smart\
    \ Agriculture (CSA) reﬂects an ambition to improve the resilience\nof agricultural\
    \ systems against climate change [9–11]. The Food and Agriculture Organiza-\n\
    tion (FAO) of the United Nations deﬁnes CSA as agriculture that enhances productivity,\n\
    improves resilience, reduces greenhouse gases (GHG) and facilitates the achievement\
    \ of\nnational food security and development goals [9]. The CSA includes both\
    \ traditional and\ninnovative approaches; and technologies that promote agricultural\
    \ productivity, increase\nthe stability at the farm level and foster the sustainability\
    \ of the relevant value chains [11].\nA system that adopts the concept of CSA\
    \ is expected to increase its resilience against\nﬂuctuating climate conditions\
    \ and therefore offer increased food production in the face of a\nchanging climate\
    \ and increased climate variability, while improving nutritional outcomes\nand\
    \ reducing the carbon cost of farming and its contribution to GHG emissions [12–15].\n\
    It includes three major pillars: (a) increasing agricultural productivity; (b)\
    \ increasing\nadaptive capacity at multiple scales (from farm to nation); and\
    \ (c) reducing greenhouse\ngas emissions [12]. While there is a consensus on the\
    \ potential of the CSA to support\nglobal food and nutritional security in less-favored\
    \ conditions [11–13], CSA scholars have\ndifferent perspectives when approaching\
    \ the scaling of CSA options.\nIntegrated systems can combine crop production,\
    \ livestock and forestry, supporting\nthe production of at least three types of\
    \ product from the same land area over a deﬁned\nperiod [16–18]. These systems,\
    \ based on inter-cropping, succession and/or rotation, can\noptimize the biological\
    \ cycling of nutrients between plants and animals, and maintain long-\nterm soil\
    \ fertility [19–21]. According to the FAO, Mixed Farming Systems (MFS) are deﬁned\n\
    as farming systems managed by households and/or enterprises where crop cultivation\
    \ and\nlivestock rearing together form integrated components of a single farming\
    \ system. MFS\noffer a lot of advantages, such as efﬁcient use of resources by\
    \ using crops and grassland to\nfeed animals and fertilize their ﬁelds with manure\
    \ from the animals, complementarities\nbetween crops and livestock and a ﬂexibility\
    \ that allows the adjustment of crop/livestock\nratios in anticipation of risks,\
    \ opportunities and needs [19,22,23]. Such context-relevant\nintegration of crops\
    \ and animals in the same system appears to support a biological,\necological\
    \ and economic sustainability in the global food production chain [17,18,23].\n\
    Nevertheless, MFS is not a universal panacea. The economic results of MFS are\
    \ not as\noptimal as those of dedicated systems, especially considering the remuneration\
    \ of labor.\nThis is the reason why MFS are usually established in less-favored\
    \ areas, e.g., mountains or\nsloppy areas, rough landscapes and heterogeneous\
    \ terrains, where conventional farming\nor breeding does not usually take place\
    \ [24]. In order to achieve a satisﬁed level of sustain-\nability under these\
    \ conditions, MFS should be able to effectively monitor the farm area, the\nanimals\
    \ and the grasslands. That is a difﬁcult task, as MFS are extremely complex systems\n\
    that include interactions between climate and weather, surface and sub-surface\
    \ soil, crops,\npastures, animal production and human management with economic\
    \ components [25].\nCritical features such as income stability and sustainability\
    \ need special quality dimensions,\ncriteria and indicators for the evaluation\
    \ of trans-disciplinary processes [26]. Moreover,\nthe climate, through weather\
    \ patterns, as time progresses, play a decisive role, as rainfall\nand temperature\
    \ drive the productivity, proﬁtability and environmental health of the\nsystem.\
    \ In addition, there is a need for reducing the energy needed to maintain the\
    \ MFS\noperation. Another challenge is related to the role of research on MFS\
    \ and the need for\nmulti-disciplinary knowledge integration. A lack of integration\
    \ between the research of\ndifferent disciplines, such as agronomists, veterinarians\
    \ and social scientists, limits the\nnecessary integral vision and makes MFS difﬁcult\
    \ to implement [27]. Moreover, science\nlacks inﬂuence mainly because of biases\
    \ towards academic research rather than practical\napplications [28]. It should\
    \ be noticed, however, that this lack of knowledge integration\nis not always\
    \ the case. There are countries that present signiﬁcant progress in integrated\n\
    farming systems from both practical and research perspectives [18]. The complexity\
    \ of\nusing MFS is increased when combining crop and livestock production due\
    \ to the increase\nof the management demands of organizing multi-tasking activities.\
    \ Considering that\nﬁnding reliable labor with the required skills in specialized\
    \ farming systems is difﬁcult\nTelecom 2021, 2\n54\nenough [29]; the problem becomes\
    \ even more acute in a diversiﬁed farming system that\nrequires the aggregation\
    \ of various kind of knowledge and skills. Additionally, for a mixed\nfarming\
    \ system, the bureaucratic and administrative workload, which requires expertise\n\
    that especially older farmers do not possess [29], is expected to increase compared\
    \ to a\nspecialized farm.\nThe success of MFS depends heavily on the aggregation\
    \ of data, which is either\nproduced by or affects the MFS, given that new technologies\
    \ and solutions are effectively\napplied in order to collect, process and use\
    \ it during decision making [30]. Precision\nagriculture is a method in which\
    \ farmers optimize inputs such as water and fertilizer\nto enhance productivity,\
    \ quality and yield. The fact that farmers are more precise with\nplanting, harvesting,\
    \ fertilizing leads to higher efﬁciency and productivity of the farm while\necological\
    \ standards are respected [31]. Today, mobile applications [32], smart sensors\
    \ [33],\nunmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) [34], cloud computing [35] and edge computing\
    \ [31]\nmake precision agriculture possible for farming cooperatives. It goes\
    \ without saying that\nthe implementation of MFS requires extended technological\
    \ features, such as sophisticated\nequipment, extended monitoring range, real-time\
    \ processing capabilities and specialized\nartiﬁcial intelligence (AI) models.\n\
    Although precision agriculture is characterized by high complexity and depends\n\
    heavily on cutting edge technologies, it constitutes a method that soon or later\
    \ is going\nbe used across the globe. Developed countries, such as USA, Australia,\
    \ Canada and\nsome European countries, including Germany, Finland, Sweden and\
    \ Denmark, have\nmade signiﬁcant progress towards this area and already show some\
    \ level of adoption\nof precision agriculture [36]. In developing countries instead,\
    \ the acquisition of cutting\nedge technologies and the lack of suitable infrastructure\
    \ constitute major impediments\nto precision agriculture exploitation. Although\
    \ precision agriculture, as it can be found\nin North America, Australia and Europe,\
    \ differs considerably in developing countries,\nthe need for accurate data and\
    \ targeted interventions is actually greater there, due to the\nstronger imperative\
    \ for change and the lack of resources [37]. What is really encouraging is\nthat\
    \ over the past few years there has been considerable effort from developing countries\n\
    to use some kinds of precision agriculture methods in various applications, such\
    \ as yield\nmonitoring and tractor auto guidance [36].\nIn developing countries,\
    \ MFS play an important role, as in some cases they act as\nthe backbone of a\
    \ sustainable agricultural policy, especially for individual farmers or\nsmall\
    \ farming communities [38]. During the last decades, research efforts in various\n\
    developing countries have been redirected to integrated farming systems rather\
    \ than\ndedicated ones, so as to cover several complementary enterprises under\
    \ various agro-\necological situations [39–41]. These efforts revealed that integrated\
    \ farming systems can not\nonly be proﬁtable and productive but also eco-friendly,\
    \ a countermeasure to unemployment\nand provide ﬁnancial stability to the stakeholders\
    \ [42].\nDesigning and applying integrated farming systems has severe constraints.\
    \ Towards\nthe technological direction, a severe constraint is the lack of long-term,\
    \ structured, concrete\ndata [43]. In the best scenarios so far, end users’ actions\
    \ heavily depend on short-term,\nbiased data. As a result, data analytic services\
    \ fail to operate on a larger scale since they\nare highly affected by area peculiarities\
    \ and seasonality [44]. That explains the fact that\ndifferent frameworks and\
    \ assessment schemes result in contradictory outcomes. Examining\nMFS implementations\
    \ in view of the end-user, a new kind of barrier that lies in farmers’\nwillingness\
    \ to cooperate, emerges. This barrier goes beyond technical solutions, adding\
    \ a\nsocio-economic dimension to the widespread exploitation of MFS.\nMiFarm-CSA\
    \ architecture aims at providing a CSA-based, multi-actor and community-\noriented\
    \ architecture, for advancing the current farming system to a smart, resilient\
    \ and\nintegrated/mixed farming ecosystem, aiming at increasing the resilience\
    \ of the underlying\nfarms, crops, livestock and forestry against the negative\
    \ impacts of the climate change.\nMoreover, the proposed architecture envisions\
    \ to foster cooperation between farmers and\nbreeders through the provision of\
    \ a sustainable MFS reference model.\nTelecom 2021, 2\n55\nThe remaining paper\
    \ is organized as follows: Section 2 highlights the current state-of-\nthe-art.\
    \ Section 3 presents the MiFarm-CSA architecture thoroughly; it illustrates the\
    \ four\nlayers of the architecture and delves into them in each of the subsections.\
    \ Section 4 outlines\nthe beneﬁts of the proposed architecture. In Section 5 the\
    \ conclusions are summarized.\n2. Related Work\nCurrent section reﬂects the current\
    \ state of the art in integrated agricultural systems\nfrom technological, economic\
    \ and social perspectives. It also points out current weaknesses\nthat tend to\
    \ be exacerbated due to the high complexity of a MFS.\n2.1. Data Aggregation Systems\n\
    Improving mixed farm productivity is essential for increasing farm proﬁtability\
    \ and\nmeeting the rapidly growing demand for food that is fueled by rapid population\
    \ growth\nacross the world and decreasing demand for energy. Mixed-farm productivity\
    \ can be\nincreased by understanding and forecasting crop and livestock performance\
    \ in a variety of\nenvironmental, social and ecological conditions. Both crop\
    \ and livestock recommendations\nare currently based on data collected in ﬁeld-based\
    \ agricultural studies that capture perfor-\nmance under a variety of conditions\
    \ (e.g., soil quality, diseases, environmental conditions,\netc.). The quality\
    \ of manually collected performance data is very low, because it does not\ntake\
    \ into account earlier conditions that have not been observed by the human operators,\n\
    but it is essential to ﬁlter out collected data that will lead to invalid conclusions.\
    \ Further-\nmore, due to MFS, we must increase the volume of data, the number\
    \ of the sources and the\nenergy demands for efﬁcient communication, consequently\
    \ increasing the complexity of\nthe data gathering process exponentially. To this\
    \ end, the utilization of emerging technolo-\ngies such as IoT devices, ground\
    \ sensors, livestock sensors (collars/ear-tags), multispectral\ncameras and UAVs\
    \ for data gathering purposes, is quite mature nowadays, and they can\nbe used\
    \ to collate vast amounts of environmental and crop-livestock performance data,\n\
    ranging from time series data from sensors, to spatial data from cameras, to human\
    \ obser-\nvations collected and recorded via smart applications [45]. More speciﬁcally,\
    \ their beneﬁts\nare extended in the whole spectrum of the agricultural ecosystem.\
    \ Their deployment\ndecreases the farmer’s labor tasks, facilitating his daily\
    \ routine and making resource alloca-\ntion more efﬁcient. Moreover, the quality\
    \ and quantity of data are improving and being\nenriched respectively, providing\
    \ insights that enhance productivity while sustainable and\neco-friendly processes\
    \ are identiﬁed and fostered. Precision agriculture and data analytics\nare reshaping\
    \ industry and market boundaries and interactions, with precision agricul-\nture\
    \ technologies (data holding, data specialization, data strategy) being a combination\n\
    of: Global Positioning System (GPS), sensors mounted on farm machines or standalone,\n\
    geo-mapping, automatics steering systems, electronic communications and variable\
    \ rate\ntechnologies [46]. Increasing UAVs’ obligations results in a higher energy\
    \ consumption, a\nfact that could disrupt the sustainability and eventually the\
    \ viability of the system [47]. In-\ntelligent devices are deployed to collect\
    \ specialized data and provide valuable information.\nSuch devices are photonics\
    \ which are utilized for monitoring and predicting the ripening\nprocess and quality\
    \ of produce, ear-tags that gather information about animals’ nutrition\nand multi-spectral\
    \ cameras that collect images in different spectrums. The incorporation\nof such\
    \ devices intensiﬁes data diversity, raising concerns about interoperability between\n\
    the physical components, data processing and information integration capabilities\
    \ [48].\nObviously, these new trends on the one hand manage to handle some of\
    \ the MFS concerns,\nbut on the other hand reveal new challenges that need to\
    \ be addressed.\n2.2. Socio-Technical and Socio-Economic Modeling\nModeling and\
    \ simulation tools can help in identifying opportunities for improved\nresource\
    \ management, crop production and farm system sustainability. Modeling tools may\n\
    also be used to predict the longer-term effects of suggested interventions and\
    \ technologies\nand to enhance the understanding of their impacts [49]. One such\
    \ tool developed in the\nTelecom 2021, 2\n56\ncontext of African smallholder farmers\
    \ is the integrated crop-livestock model NUANCES-\nFARMSIM [50]. Agricultural\
    \ Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) is the most used\nsimulator for agriculture\
    \ proposes. Since 1990, it has grown from a ﬁeld-focused farming\nsystems framework\
    \ used by a small number of people, into a large collection of models\nused by\
    \ thousands of modelers internationally. In this vein, APSIM Initiative is developing\n\
    the next generation of APSIM [51].\nFRAM and STAMP represent the current state-of-the-art\
    \ for socio-technical model-\ning [52]. Both are deliberately lacking theoretical\
    \ background about socio-technical system\ndynamics. Thus, the structure of modeling\
    \ and inquiry is retrospective [53–55]. They are\nhindered in their utility and\
    \ applicability by this theoretical vacuum. New methods are\nneeded which are\
    \ situated in a well-considered and thought-out theoretical landscape and\nwhich\
    \ are based on evidence [56,57].\nRecent literature suggests that understanding\
    \ and considering the role of behav-\nioral factors in farmers’ adoption of sustainable\
    \ practices can help enrich the traditional\neconomic analysis of farmers’ decision-making\
    \ [58]. Within this literature, there is a bur-\ngeoning stream investigating\
    \ the role of behavioral factors. Pre-testing the impacts of\nthese behavioral\
    \ factors on farmers’ decision making can, in turn, lead to more effective\nagro-environmental\
    \ policies, a crucial challenge in view of the enhanced environmental\nand climate\
    \ ambitions for the future Common Agricultural Policy [59,60].\nMoreover, economic\
    \ experiments can be used effectively to improve the design and\nimplementation\
    \ of agriculture policy and programs. Recent developments have raised\nconﬁdence\
    \ in experiments as a useful tool for economic and policy analysis [61,62]. Beyond\n\
    their role in reshaping how economic research is conducted, social science experiments\
    \ have\nbeen used extensively to inﬂuence the designs of both markets and public\
    \ policies [63–65].\nObservation of behavior in a lab is convenient and affords\
    \ a high degree of control over\nthe environment, but the contexts of the laboratory\
    \ and the participants are in many ways\ndissimilar to those in naturally occurring\
    \ environments [66,67].\n2.3. MFS Integration Analysis and Evaluation\nMFS are\
    \ considered efﬁcient designs for sustainable, ecologically-based farming sys-\n\
    tems. The sustainability of MFS relies on the complementarities between crops,\
    \ livestock\nand forestry, and the exchange of resources within them. Not many\
    \ studies are available\nfrom the last years in integrated systems, especially\
    \ those involving all sectors of crops,\nlivestock and forestry together. Two\
    \ use cases were presented in [68], involving crops,\nanimals and grasslands in\
    \ France and Brazil. In [69] is an integration of crops and livestock\napproach,\
    \ which helps farmers to develop a broader understanding of systemic interactions\n\
    between crop and livestock activities on their farms. In [70] the authors presented\
    \ a compre-\nhensive assessment of all integrated systems identiﬁed in Mato Grosso\
    \ by 2012/13. Despite\nthe beneﬁts associated with MFS, little is known about\
    \ these systems or the challenges of\nimplementing them, and only a limited number\
    \ of farmers have adopted them so far.\n2.4. Knowledge-Based Management System\
    \ in Agriculture\nAlthough some work exists in knowledge-based management and\
    \ information sys-\ntems in the agricultural domain, none of it corresponds to\
    \ Mixed Farming Systems. GECO\nis presented in [71], which allows users formalize\
    \ knowledge in a collaborative manner and\nto make it available to a large community.\
    \ In [72] the authors propose a knowledge-based\nmanagement system for exchanging\
    \ and creating knowledge in organic farming. Smart-\nAKIS [73] is a European network\
    \ mainstreaming smart farming technologies among the\nEuropean farmer community,\
    \ aiming to bridge the gap between practitioners and research\non the identiﬁcation\
    \ and delivery of new smart farming solutions to ﬁt the farmers’ needs.\n2.5.\
    \ MFS Services\nDespite the renewed interest in MFS, these systems are facing\
    \ a number of barriers\nand are still declining worldwide, representing about\
    \ 14% of agricultural systems all over\nTelecom 2021, 2\n57\nthe world. The level\
    \ of specialization depends on economic context, labor availability\nand pedo-climatic\
    \ conditions. Despite their theoretical sustainability performance, MFS\nhave\
    \ been disappearing at the farm level. This could be partly explained by their\
    \ low\neconomic performance and social (work) constraints. First of all, MFS are\
    \ not achieving\nequally good economic results to specialized farms. According\
    \ to Farm Accountancy\nData Network (FADN) [74] data, the average productivity\
    \ of mixed farms, in terms of\noutput/input economic value ratio, is comparable\
    \ to the productivity of all European\nfarms. The efﬁciency in input is comparable\
    \ between mixed farming and all types of\nfarms. Still, the income per worker\
    \ in mixed farms remained below the EU-27 average.\nMoreover, direct payments\
    \ represent a substantial part of farm net value added for grazing\nlivestock,\
    \ and mixed and ﬁeld crop farms, due to their average farm size and the historical\n\
    orientations of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) [75].\n2.6. Decision Support\
    \ Systems in Agriculture\nDSS tools are divided into four categories in terms\
    \ of applications: animals and animal\nproducts, land water and environment, crop\
    \ and agribusiness and markets. Examples of\ncrop DSS are MyCrop, ROOTMAP, Yield\
    \ Calculator and SPLAT. For management problems\nin farms, intelligent DSS in\
    \ agriculture have been introduced to monitor and to assist\nfarmers to make decisions\
    \ in a timely manner. However, designing a DSS is quite complex\nand requires\
    \ knowledge from various multidisciplinary areas. Adinarayana et al. [76]\nproposed\
    \ an information, communication and dissemination system called GeoSense. The\n\
    system was designed to help in decision making for precision farming. Other work\
    \ by\nTamayo et al. [77] implemented a DSS for fertilization, crop growth control\
    \ and prediction\nof diseases. Only two types of sensors, temperature and humidity,\
    \ were utilized in their\nsystem. Jiber, Harroud and karmouch [78] focused their\
    \ study on designing a precision\nagricultural monitoring framework. However,\
    \ this study was limited as it did not use test\nbeds to evaluate the performance\
    \ of their monitoring systems. Aiello, Giuseppe et al. [79]\nproposed a methodological\
    \ approach using a majority rule and bioeconomy strategies that\nimplements a\
    \ decision fusion algorithm which allows one to make the decisions about\nthe\
    \ possible risk of pest disease on the basis of the information (dew point temperature,\n\
    leaf temperature, etc.) collected from all sensors of the network. Grigera, Julian\
    \ et al. [80]\npresented three different usability evaluations: a heuristic evaluation,\
    \ a user test and an\nautomated diagnosis, based on 244 farmers and advisors in\
    \ UK, and concluded that the\nmost inﬂuential factor is the “ease to use a DSS”.\n\
    3. MiFarm-CSA Architecture\nMFS is characterized by multiple instances of crops,\
    \ livestock and forestry, which\nmay be in small or large geographical areas.\
    \ Currently, MFS is not characterized by\nintense use of information and communication\
    \ technologies (ICT) and where it exists, it\nis only used separately per farm\
    \ or livestock level. In addition, current approaches are\neither very simplistic,\
    \ omitting important aspect of MFS, or rather complex, making them\nimpossible\
    \ to implement, which generate drawbacks in management and at the economical\n\
    level that prevent farmers from adopting MFS. MiFarm-CSA envisions to constitute\
    \ an\noverall architecture that facilitates data exchange and integration in one\
    \ platform which\nis delivered to the end users as a service, supporting several\
    \ ICT deployments in crops,\nlivestock and forestry, regardless of their geographical\
    \ location. This approach is aiming\nto leverage MFS and improve in economic,\
    \ social and environmental indicators. Figure 1\nillustrates the MiFarm-CSA view\
    \ of MFS against the current state.\nThe proposed architecture follows a layered\
    \ approach since it offers a lot of beneﬁts in\ncomparison with a non-layered\
    \ one. These beneﬁts are summarized below:\n•\nEasier to understand: architecture\
    \ will be easier to understand, not only for the\narchitects who designed it,\
    \ but also for the technicians who are going to build and\nmaintain it and for\
    \ the people who are going to participate in it.\nTelecom 2021, 2\n58\n•\nEasier\
    \ to test: having a layered architecture makes it possible to deﬁne independent\n\
    components much better, which makes component testing easier.\n•\nEasier to extend:\
    \ adding new features or changing current ones is easier in a layered\narchitecture.\n\

    \ MiFarm-CSA concept.\nIn particular, the proposed architecture consists of four\
    \ main layers:\nIntegrated Data Collection Network: In detail, the Integrated\
    \ Data Collection Network\n(IDCON) applies to the area of MFS, to monitor any\
    \ type of crops; livestock and forestry;\nand climate and soil parameters. More\
    \ speciﬁcally, this tier exploits a wide range of Internet\nof Things (IoT) sensors,\
    \ devices, gateways and servers, UAVs and FANETs, which are\ncapable of covering\
    \ large-scale areas for providing big volumes of data in near real time,\nsuch\
    \ as information about the temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed, pH, dissolved\n\
    oxygen levels, temperature, conductivity, etc. IDCON encloses four main tools,\
    \ namely,\nthe data capturing and recording system, which includes the smart sensing\
    \ and tracking\nsensors, the aerial sensing systems and the weather and climate\
    \ control systems; the energy\nmanagement and harvesting system (EMHS); the semantic\
    \ middleware and gateways\n(SMG); and cloud-based event and data analytics (CEDA)\
    \ which includes the livestock\nfarm management system and the cloud application.\n\
    The Social-Ecological Conceptual Framework: The second layer concerns the MiFarm-\n\
    CSA Social-Ecological Conceptual Framework (SECF) which aims to support sophisticated\n\
    capabilities such as integrated farming to yield forecasts, and optimization of\
    \ crop man-\nagement in terms of fertilization, irrigation and sowing density,\
    \ while at the same time\nTelecom 2021, 2\n59\nproviding social learning modules,\
    \ in a user-friendly way, thinking skills, virtual scenarios,\ncase studies and\
    \ long-term predictions, estimations and business-oriented best practices\nbased\
    \ on the input received from the underlying MiFarm-CSA IDCON layer.\nThe Mixed\
    \ Farming as a Service: The top layer of the architecture is the Mixed Farming\n\
    as a Service (MFaS) which provides a set of advanced and efﬁcient user applications\n\
    and services destined to farmers and stakeholders. More speciﬁcally, the MFaS\
    \ encloses\neight main applications, namely: Resource Managers (ReMa), Integrated\
    \ Irrigation and\nFertilization Application (IFRA), Anomaly and Pest Detection\
    \ Tool (APED), Novel Climate\nService and Application (NCSA), Digital Market Radar\
    \ (DiMaRa), Web-based Knowledge\nExchange Service (W-KES) and Integrated Farming\
    \ Systems Economics (IFSEC).\nEvidence-based Assessment Methodology: The last\
    \ layer concerns the MiFarm-CSA\nEvidence-based Assessment Methodology (EVAM),\
    \ which serves as an horizontal layer\nthat covers all the other layers, as the\
    \ socio-economic aspects should be taken into account\nduring all steps of the\
    \ development of MFS. EVAM layer includes the SCOPE methodology\nfor examining\
    \ and creating dynamic process maps focusing on process functionality, social\n\
    cohesion and the mediation of collective knowledge and information cycles. A further\n\
    element of this approach is the social license to operate (SLO) concept. This\
    \ concept relates\nto the continued acceptance of a set of business practices\
    \ or operating procedures by a\ncompany’s employees, stakeholders and the general\
    \ public. In addition, in this layer the\nbehavioral decision-making is also taken\
    \ into account as it is a method to inﬂuence the\nfarmers to adopt environmentally\
    \ suitable practices.\nTable 1, provides brief deﬁnitions of the concepts, technologies\
    \ and practices used in\nMiFarm-CSA architecture.\n3.1. Integrated Data Collection\
    \ Network\nThe provision of an advanced data collection network and autonomous\
    \ monitoring is\na major pillar of MiFarm-CSA, which is realized by the IDCON.\
    \ Figure 2 illustrates IDCON,\nwhich aims at designing and deploying the technology\
    \ means that will allow MiFarm-CSA\nto measure data from different farming systems,\
    \ e.g., forests, crops and livestock, and\nto expand the capability of the MFS\
    \ in rough and slope terrains and in large-scale lands.\nIDCON encloses six cutting-edge\

    \ telecommunication wide area network designed to allow\nlong-range communications\
    \ at a low bit rate among things,\nsuch as sensors operated on a battery.\nGeographic\
    \ Information System\nA conceptualized framework that provides the\nability to\
    \ capture and analyze spatial and geographic data.\nInitially, the data capturing\
    \ and recording takes place by using the SST, ASSM and\nWCCF. SST includes electronic\
    \ sensors (passive and active wireless sensor devices) for\nenvironmental monitoring\
    \ (quality of water, soil, air and nutrition concentration), phyto-\nelectronic\
    \ sensors for measuring environmental and soil changes via metabolic changes\n\
    in plants (e.g., pH level and phytohormones) and soil-derived GHG emissions sensors\n\
    that measure the effects of regenerative grazing regime and mixed farming practices\
    \ on\nGHG losses. In addition, low-cost IoT-enabled GHG sensors are utilized for\
    \ measuring\nthe effects of emissions on local and regional levels. Since animal\
    \ tracking is of paramount\nimportance in any MFS, specialized IoT devices (e.g.,\
    \ collars and ear-tags) are also utilized\nfor locating, monitoring and managing\
    \ livestock. Beyond the conventional information\nsuch as (i) location, (ii) motion,\
    \ (iii) temperature and (iv) animal behavior, collars and\near-tags can show (i)\
    \ the areas of the farm that have been most frequently occupied and (ii)\nthe\
    \ history of the areas where the animals have been grazing. As a result, MiFarm-CSA\n\
    architecture is able to boost feed efﬁciency, increase food quality, mitigate\
    \ risks regarding\nthe animal loss, decrease the stakeholder’s expenses and increase\
    \ his income.\nSince the beginning of the development of new generations of UAVs,\
    \ these platforms\nwere considered a well suited tool, under different conﬁgurations,\
    \ in agriculture, livestock\nand forestry because of their potential (size, weight,\
    \ ﬂight speed and altitude) [81]. ASSM\nprovides a sophisticated technology by\
    \ deploying single UAVs or groups of UAVs (FANETs)\nfor implementing several monitoring\
    \ and surveillance activities in the crops, livestock and\nTelecom 2021, 2\n61\n\
    forests [82]. The UAVs can be equipped with (i) multispectral sensors, (ii) hyperspectral\n\
    sensors, (iii) thermal sensors, (iv) cameras and (v) GPS. The information is gathered\
    \ by\nscanning crops, livestock and forest landscapes. In particular, by scanning\
    \ the crops,\nASSM will acquire (i) soil and ﬁeld analysis, (ii) crop monitoring,\
    \ (iii) yield estimation\n(iv) bidirectional reﬂectance properties of plant surfaces,\
    \ (v) health of plants (leaf area\nindex, chlorophyll content, water stress detection,\
    \ photosynthesis soil analysis) and (vi)\nsoil composition in agricultural ﬁelds\
    \ to estimate crop yields based on the computation of\nvegetation indices in farmlands\
    \ [83]. By scanning livestock, ASSM will be able to gather\ninformation related\
    \ to (i) counting animals; (ii) locations of animals; (iii) animal temperature;\n\
    (iv) body condition scoring; (v) number of newly born animals; (vi) disease detection\
    \ and\nanimal identiﬁcation using radio frequency identiﬁcation (RFID). Lastly,\
    \ ASSM will be\ncapable of monitoring forests in terms of (i) carbon sequestration,\
    \ (ii) tree canopy analysis,\n(iii) conservation features, (iv) monitoring biodiversity,\
    \ (v) ecological landscape features\nand (vi) plant and tree health. As a result,\
    \ ASSM constitutes a powerful information\ngathering tool, which offers advanced,\
    \ real-time data collection and measurements tool,\nwhile expanding the monitored\
    \ landscape, thereby allowing the development of MFS in\nrough areas. ASSM is\
    \ expected to contribute to the resilience increase through instant\nmacroscopic\
    \ data gathering which enhances decision making, while reducing the cost\n(labor\
    \ cost and data acquiring) of current solutions, e.g., ground surveying. Furthermore,\n\
    based on technological advances such as edge computing, the ASSM can incorporate\n\
    on-board, real-time video analyzers which enable the autonomous and dynamic ﬂight\n\
    control of UAV according to the results of video surveillance output. As a result,\
    \ the time\nneeded for scanning an area will be highly reduced, allowing MiFarm-CSA\
    \ to expand the\nscalability of the monitored landscape.\nWCCF can further extend\
    \ the information provided to the MFS by including satellite,\nmeteorological\
    \ and climate-related information. Satellite-derived measurements are es-\nsential\
    \ inputs to monitor water management and agricultural production for improving\n\
    regional food security [84]. Observations coming from near real-time satellites\
    \ can be used\nto mitigate the adverse impacts of extreme events and promote climate\
    \ resilience.\nMiFarm-CSA architecure can beneﬁt from energy harvesting techniques\
    \ in the op-\neration of SST to reduce the environmental impact of farming. The\
    \ optimal “energy\nmanagement” policy can be deﬁned based on existing machine\
    \ learning (ML) models and\nAI algorithms [85].\nConsidering data storage and\
    \ transfer, middleware software and the necessary hard-\nware gateways and actuators\
    \ are needed for storing and forwarding the captured data.\nThe SMG component\
    \ provides the necessary middleware software and gateway infras-\ntructure to\
    \ support IDCON by gathering all kinds of information from different sources.\n\
    The middleware should able to abstract the heterogeneity and complexity of the\
    \ under-\nlying hardware devices, appliances or unmanned vehicles (data transmission\
    \ formats,\nmanufacturer particular features, operating systems, etc.) and to\
    \ provide inter-operability\namong sensors, robots and smart devices. Reliability\
    \ in communications, real-time data\ndistribution, automatic discovery of entities\
    \ and quality of service (QoS) monitoring is\nguaranteed by the middleware itself.\n\
    The CEDA component provides the data collection and processing system that is\n\
    carried through into distributed computing systems and clusters for real-time\
    \ processing.\nTo this end, robust data analytics, high performance computing,\
    \ efﬁcient data network\nmanagement and cloud computing (CC) techniques are used\
    \ [86]. More speciﬁcally, the\nmain pillars are (i) the integration of data that\
    \ originate from different sources via a\ncommon communication point, and (ii)\
    \ the provision of suitable adaptive algorithms for\neffective, dynamic and autonomous\
    \ decision-making. Taking into account the massive and\nheterogeneous characteristics\
    \ of data, acquiring and processing all of it is inefﬁcient in terms\nof communication\
    \ cost, computing complexity and the utilization of data storage resources.\n\
    For this reason, dimensionality reduction should provide a reduced version (sketch)\
    \ of\noriginal data taking into account the speciﬁc characteristics of the data\
    \ generated.\nTelecom 2021, 2\n62\nThe Panoptis platform consists of hardware\
    \ add-ons (collars and ear-tags) and soft-\nware modules that provide tools to\
    \ livestock farmers so as to locate and monitor livestock.\nThe platform allows\
    \ one to generate many types of enclosures, sub-areas and points of\ninterest.\
    \ This allows one to have records and monitoring of animal behavior in these enclo-\n\
    sures. The challenge in this component lies in the integration of information\
    \ when received\nfrom different sources: (a) IoT devices mounted on animals; (b)\
    \ satellite information about\npastures; (c) weather forecast; (d) soil sensors,\
    \ in a DSS to improve grazing management.\nThe interconnection between the data\
    \ collecting and the data storing can be achieved\nthrough low power wide area\
    \ networks (LPWAN) such as LoRA and Sigfox telecom-\nmunication networks. LoRa\
    \ and Sigfox protocols are widely used for supporting smart\napplications and\
    \ monitoring systems [87].\n3.2. Evidence-Based Assessment Methodology\nEVAM is\
    \ deﬁned as a major pillar of the proposed architecture, for fostering the\ninvolvement\
    \ of end-users in the MFS landscape, consisting of the following components:\n\
    (a) (SCOPE) methodology, (b) the SLO concept, (c) the behavioral decision-making\
    \ (BDm)\nand (d) the Behavioral Intervention Engine (BIE).\nOftentimes in technology,\
    \ development projects the social, behavioral and even hu-\nman aspects of the\
    \ technology play a secondary role to the technological aspects. The\nproposed\
    \ architecture intends to use innovative human factor approaches and method-\n\
    ologies to champion social and behavioral aspects and to prioritize the role of\
    \ the human\nin the development of technology. Doing so will ensure that the implementation\
    \ will not\nencounter barriers relating to user acceptance, usability and other\
    \ human barriers. The\nstarting point involves reﬁning new methods for modeling\
    \ the socio-technical aspects\nof farming systems and to examine the social and\
    \ behavioral aspects of mixed farming\nand agroforestry. The SCOPE methodology\
    \ examines and creates dynamic process maps\nfocusing on three interlocking and\
    \ interdependent levels of analysis: (i) process function-\nality (operational\
    \ processes); (ii) social cohesion (trust and social networks); and (iii) the\n\
    mediation of (i) and (ii) through collective knowledge and information cycles\
    \ [88].\nA further element of this layer is the SLO concept. This concept relates\
    \ to the continued\nacceptance of a set of business practices or operating procedures\
    \ by a company’s employees,\nstakeholders and the general public. The concept\
    \ of social license is closely related to the\nconcept of resilience and sustainability,\
    \ and the work to deﬁne and develop the SLO in this\narchitecture will ensure\
    \ that the technical innovations can be supported by sustained social\nand behavioral\
    \ change.\nAccording to many MFS experts, the problems of the end users, mostly\
    \ farmers,\nare not just about knowledge: it is about building the habit of cooperating.\
    \ Over the\nlast few decades, researchers have increasingly studied the factors\
    \ that inﬂuence farmers’\nadoption of environmentally sustainable practices [89].\
    \ Previous academic attempts to\ntake stock of the factors inﬂuencing farmers’\
    \ adoption of sustainable practices [90] did\nnot speciﬁcally focus on the roles\
    \ of behavioral factors, often resulting in an incomplete\noverview and limited\
    \ theoretical understanding of how and why these factors affect\ndecision-making.\
    \ There have been some efforts in policy circles to make an inventory\nof behavioral\
    \ factors inﬂuencing farmers’ adoption of sustainable practices, but their\ndisciplinary\
    \ scope was restricted to behavioral economics and communication sciences [91].\n\
    For this reason, MiFarm-CSA architecture introduces BDm which adopts the experimental\n\
    research concept combined with laboratory experiments in parallel. The innovation\
    \ of this\nconcept lies in the following twofold statement: (a) it evaluates ex-ante\
    \ farmers’ choices\nwhen they are faced with voluntary versus mandatory schemes\
    \ and with results based or\ncollective schemes, and (b) it includes experiments\
    \ in the ﬁeld, which are carried out to\ninform agricultural policies by including\
    \ a behavioral component, as the outcome variable\ngenerally consists of decisions\
    \ made by farmers [92,93]. To take a positive step forward,\nthe proposed architecture\
    \ is built on top of BDm the BIE. The latter aims at: (a) predicting\nthe expected\
    \ MFS-related behavior (behavioral intentions) of farmers on the basis of a\n\
    Telecom 2021, 2\n63\nset of socio-economic factors, (b) facilitating the selection\
    \ and application of appropriate\nstrategies through a number of communication\
    \ tools and channels and (c) driving the\ndesired MFS development widely. The\
    \ main operating elements of the BIE break down as\nfollows: farmers can be clustered\
    \ according to their (socio-demographic) proﬁles, and the\nsuitability of involvement\
    \ strategies is deﬁned both by the user proﬁle and by additional\nsocio-economic\
    \ factors (e.g., country culture). The resulting model will be used by the\nMiFarm-CSA\
    \ decision support system.\n3.3. The Social-Ecological Conceptual Framework\n\
    The lessons learnt and the experience of farmers stemming from the existing MFS\n\
    are of paramount importance for further development of MFS. The production of\
    \ more\nknowledge on MFS and the knowledge acquisition by farmers are both required\
    \ in order to\ndevelop sustainable, productive, viable and efﬁcient future MFS.\
    \ The SECF component of\nMiFarm-CSA architecture aims to foster core interactions\
    \ among animals, forests and crops,\nwhile mitigating the high complexity of these\
    \ interactions. SECF follows a participatory,\nlearning and technology-oriented\
    \ methodological approach based on knowledge-driven\ntools. This methodological\
    \ approach is deﬁned in ﬁve main pillars, namely, (a) the par-\nticipatory knowledge\
    \ building (PKB), (b) the mixed farming simulator (MFSim), (c) the\nexperimentally-oriented\
    \ co-design process (EC-P), (d) the peer learning network (PLN)\nand (e) decision-making\
    \ engine (D-ME).\nPKB involves the critical knowledge extraction, which encloses\
    \ the most important\nknowledge needed to support sustainable MFS. This knowledge\
    \ can be extracted from\nmeetings, seminars and workshops and recent literature\
    \ ﬁndings. The contributions of\ninternational experts who will analyze and evaluate\
    \ the current knowledge and remaining\nuncertainties about large-scale, commercial\
    \ MFS are crucial. The PLN pillar encourages\ntechnical and organizational innovation;\
    \ it enhances learning options, while reducing the\nisolated position of this\
    \ kind of system in a specialized world. The PLN could address\nMFS, by (a) identifying\
    \ learning issues, (b) supporting the exchange of (tacit) knowledge\nwithin the\
    \ network and (c) organizing access to relevant sources of knowledge outside the\n\
    peer network. The ﬁnal step of the PKB is related to the knowledge-exchange beyond\
    \ the\nPLN. The PLN ensures knowledge exchange among peers; e.g., it could also\
    \ be valuable\nthat experienced farmers and stakeholders organize access for other\
    \ actors (advisors,\nresearch and policy makers) who are interested in MFS. Field\
    \ visits, thematic networks and\ntechnological demonstrations constitute an immersive\
    \ type of learning which can enhance\nsigniﬁcantly the process of knowledge exchange.\n\
    The participatory knowledge building can be enriched with state-of-the-art technolo-\n\
    gies like virtual and augmented reality. Such technology could maximize the participants’\n\
    engagement in the training material, by fostering the motivation of end users\
    \ to be engaged\nto the PKB and the SECF activities in general.\nThe MFSim is\
    \ also introduced as another major pillar of SECF in order to mitigate\nthe complexity\
    \ of MFS. Recent trends in broader collaboration across institutions, across\n\
    disciplines and between the public and private sectors suggest that the stage\
    \ is set for the\nmajor advances in agricultural systems science that are needed\
    \ for the next generation of\nmodels, databases, knowledge products and decision\
    \ support systems [49,94]. Specialized\nsimulation modeling of crop–livestock\
    \ integration among farms is the basis for achieving\nthe up-scaling process involved\
    \ in integrating beyond the farm level. Furthermore, com-\nputer simulation with\
    \ environmental-economic models at the farm level provide a useful\ntool for integrating\
    \ knowledge and information to predict production efﬁciency, environ-\nmental\
    \ impacts and the effects of management policies on production performance [95].\n\
    The MFSim is introduced as the main modeling and simulation tool of designing,\
    \ testing,\nvalidating and evaluating mixed farming modeling systems and complex\
    \ simulation sce-\nnarios. The aim of MFSim lies in the fact that it allows farmers,\
    \ stakeholders and supply\nchain actors to experiment with diversiﬁed cropping,\
    \ animal and forest systems without\nhaving to invest or risk resources. MFSim\
    \ could also enable stakeholders to (a) model\nTelecom 2021, 2\n64\nand simulate\
    \ different variations of forest-crop-livestock integrated farms, (b) model and\n\
    simulate different use of resources (nutrients, land, manure management, etc.)\
    \ and (c)\nmodel and simulate manure management practices and animal feeding.\
    \ In particular,\nMFSim could provide signiﬁcant insights in (a) simulating livestock\
    \ performance, while\ngrazing grain crops, (b) assessing diversifying crop rotations\
    \ in terms of sale and animal\nfeeding sources, (c) studying and evaluating tactical\
    \ and strategic responses to improve\nthe performance of livestock feed systems,\
    \ (d) modeling and evaluating the implications\nof grazing crops on the livestock\
    \ system as a whole, (e) analyzing and evaluating the\nproduction and economic\
    \ risk mitigation beneﬁts that arise from operating a mix of crop\nand livestock\
    \ systems, (f) evaluating recycling tactics in animal manure to fertilize crops\n\
    and (g) simulating the integration of alternate crops in the crop rotations.\n\
    The EC-P is also introduced as a component of SECF, as its aim is to motivate\
    \ farmers\nto cooperate in the knowledge exchange processes without feeling loss\
    \ of freedom and\nindependence [96,97]. The EC-P engages farmers in laboratory\
    \ and ﬁeld experiments,\nby conducting trials and demonstrations together with\
    \ the experts. In particular, during\nlaboratory experiments, the stakeholders\
    \ and the researchers can work together and see\nhow the technology will be used\
    \ in practice.\n3.4. Mixed Farming as a Service\nThe MFaS is the fourth main pillar\
    \ of MiFarm-CSA whose aim is to deliver a rich suite\nof tools and services to\
    \ the end users (farmers, agricultural companies, decision makers,\nregulators,\
    \ supply chain actors, stakeholders and individuals) in three dimensions, namely,\n\
    (a) environmental, (b) economic and (c) social. MFaS goes beyond than a conventional\n\
    toolkit for farmers; it constitutes the main decision support system of the proposed\
    \ architec-\nture. MFaS serves as an integrated management software that helps\
    \ farmers and growers\nto establish sustainable farm management practices and\
    \ reach proﬁtable crop production,\nby enclosing various applications and services\
    \ related to conventional farming systems.\nThe envisioned MFaS should support\
    \ the following MFS applications and services: (a)\nthe Integrated Farming Systems\
    \ Economics (IFSEC), (b) the W-KES, (c) the APED, (d) the\nIntegrated Irrigation\
    \ and Fertilization Application (IIFA), (e) the NCSA, (f) the Resource\nManagers\
    \ (ReMa) and (g) the DiMaRa.\nIFSEC is a critical component of MFaS, as it provides\
    \ the decision-making compo-\nnent of the proposed architecture. IFSEC analyses\
    \ existing case-studies of well-managed\nMFS; develops a labor-balanced analysis\
    \ based on farm surveys; develops participative\napproaches with groups of farmers\
    \ to consider their management strategies and develop\nscenarios; and identiﬁes\
    \ management tools to assess MFS labor requirements and associ-\nated costs so\
    \ as to facilitate integration between farms. In particular, IFSEC should abe\n\
    considered as completed when it is in such position to provide (a) advanced logistics,\
    \ (b)\nadvanced ﬁnancial management, (c) MFS management and (d) MFS visualizations.\
    \ The\nIFSEC advanced logistics could include (i) labor management, (ii) machinery\
    \ management\nand (iii) inventory management. In general, the end user should\
    \ be able to register a farm\nby adding ﬁnancial information, work task assignment\
    \ per worker and cost per worker.\nAdditionally, economic features for machinery\
    \ can be included, i.e., cost per individual\ncategory task per hour or area unit.\
    \ Reservation for a machine for speciﬁc hours and inven-\ntory management could\
    \ be available as well. The IFSEC advanced ﬁnancial management\ncould include\
    \ the management of (i) sales, (ii) expenses, (iii) assets, (iv) loans, (v) budget\n\
    and (vi) transactions. The end user should be able to register sales invoices\
    \ containing\nmultiple items, while the corresponding quantity per item will automatically\
    \ stored to the\ndeﬁned warehouse. The IFSEC MFS management could involve: (i)\
    \ crop-livestock diversi-\nﬁcation per individual ﬁeld; (ii) week, month, year\
    \ and long-term forecasting, including\ntemperature, wind speed and rainfall (mm).\
    \ Information for pests, weeds and diseases\nwith detailed descriptions and a\
    \ list with active substances which ﬁght or prevent them\ncould be included as\
    \ well. The IFSEC MFS visualizations will bring new dashboards with\nreal-time\
    \ data with predeﬁned templates like usage, productivity, ﬁnances, Key Perfor-\n\
    Telecom 2021, 2\n65\nmance Indicators (KPIs) and ﬁeld analytics, while the MiFarm-CSA\
    \ engine will be featured\nto export a structured report in a user-friendly manner,\
    \ such as tasks, crop production,\nusage, ﬁnances, cost per task, inventory and\
    \ resources.\nThe W-KES applies a collaborative service to share knowledge, experiences\
    \ and\ninnovations among the different people involved in the design and application\
    \ of MFS\nagricultural systems. W-KES is composed by three components: (a) the\
    \ W-KES semantic\nmodel, (b) the W-KES web-based application and (c) W-KES forum.\
    \ The semantic model\nis organized in a set of triplets, “subject”, “predicate”\
    \ and “object” [98], and the triplets\nare interconnected. The main resources\
    \ of the W-KES semantic model are (a) web pages\ncreated in a collaborative manner,\
    \ (b) simulation results conducted by the MFSim, (c) best\npractices formed as\
    \ documents, stemming from the SECF and (d) educational material and\ntraining\
    \ modules coming from the PLN. These resources are associated with certain triplets;\n\
    for example, users can associate the triplet “wheat”, as “can be attacked by”:\
    \ “aphids” in a\nweb page presenting knowledge about wheat. Furthermore, the W-KES\
    \ intends to include\na knowledge search service, which allows users to query\
    \ web pages by keyword, string\nor sentence matching. For example, a user may\
    \ search for manure quality management\nfor MFS and the W-KES web-based application\
    \ will propose related web pages, material\ncontent from the PLN and best practices—extracted\
    \ from the SECF layer. Lastly, the W-KES\nweb-based application incorporates a\
    \ forum, which allows any user to share his opinion; or\nask the community about\
    \ information or a new topic that he cannot ﬁnd in another source.\nThe innovation\
    \ behind this service lies in the fact that it can also enable direct and indirect\n\
    exchange of resources like feed and manure.\nBased on the information collected\
    \ by the IDCON, The APED and the IIFA are en-\nvisaged as smart services for in-ﬁeld\
    \ operations and data analysis. According to the\ncharacteristics of plant pathogens,\
    \ efﬁcient plant disease management requires a high\ndensity of spatial and temporal\
    \ information regarding the condition of any parameter\nrelated to the crop growth\
    \ [99]. Hyperspectral images combined with ground sensors can\nidentify host–pathogen\
    \ interactions at an early stage. This fact can simplify the complexity\nof the\
    \ identiﬁcation and the quantiﬁcation of different kinds of stress factors that\
    \ may result\nin crop anomalies [100]. Moreover, data mining techniques [101]\
    \ (ML methods like artiﬁcial\nneural networks or support vector machines (SVM))\
    \ can be leveraged since they have\nproved to be superior for distinguishing in\
    \ between more than one type of stress factors\nand different diseases [102].\
    \ The integration of ground sensor data provided by SST and\nimage data provided\
    \ by ASSM in combination with Geographic Information Systems (GIS)\nand data mining\
    \ techniques will constitute the core of APED services. IIFA services besides\n\
    the integration between ground sensor data provided by SST and image data provided\
    \ by\nASSM will also incorporate data from WCCF. This holistic integration of\
    \ drought-causative\ninformation (precipitation) and drought-responsive information\
    \ (vegetation condition,\ncrop anomaly) aim to develop specialized variations\
    \ of well known vegetation indexes\n(e.g., normalized difference vegetation index)\
    \ (i) for superior drought monitoring and (ii)\nfor early indication of any decrease\
    \ in crop production associated with drought or lack of\nnutrients [103].\nA dashboard\
    \ will be the human–machine interface for delivering the information com-\ning\
    \ from the WCCF, and to make suggestions and recommendations based on the captured\n\
    satellite, meteorological and climate-related information. Concurrently, the dashboard\n\
    could also digest the information stemming from the meteorological stations, which\
    \ are\ninstalled at the ﬁeld, in order to provide short-term predictions and suggestions.\n\
    Recent political priorities in Europe aim to rationalize agricultural production,\
    \ reduce\npollution, upgrade the environment, maintain rural infrastructures and\
    \ meet new societal\nconcerns, such as product quality and animal welfare. For\
    \ example, soil testing has been\nproven to be a valuable tool for evaluating\
    \ the available nutrient status of soil. The soil\ninvestigation is exceptionally\
    \ useful for cultivators to discover which sort of harvests to\nbe developed in\
    \ a speciﬁc soil condition and helps to determine the proper amount of\nnutrients\
    \ to be added to a given soil based on its fertility and crop needs. The intensiﬁcation\n\
    Telecom 2021, 2\n66\nof livestock operations in the last few decades has resulted\
    \ in increased social concern over\nthe environmental impacts of livestock operations,\
    \ and thus making appropriate manure\nmanagement decisions is increasingly important.\
    \ Animal manure is a valuable resource\nif handled responsibly but a source of\
    \ serious challenges and public health concerns\nif managed inappropriately. Risks\
    \ associated with animal manure handling could be\nrelated to soil, water and\
    \ air quality. A socially acceptable manure management system\nthat simultaneously\
    \ achieves the pressing environmental objectives while balancing the\nsocio-economic\
    \ welfare of farmers and society at large is needed. Manure management\ndecisions\
    \ involve a number of decision makers with different and conﬂicting views of\n\
    what is acceptable in the context of sustainable development. In order to ensure\
    \ that\nthe proposed schema is complete, this kind of resource management can\
    \ not be ignored.\nFor this reason, MiFarm-CSA introduces ReMA includes a series\
    \ of resource managers to\nprovide the optimal and accurate resource allocation:\n\
    •\nThe Soil Manager (SOMA) aims provide optimal decisions, recommendations and\n\
    case studies on how the soil quality will be maximized. While each of these decisions,\n\
    recommendations and case studies represent possible techniques to effectively\
    \ manage\nsoil resources, each practice will be adequately assessed to identify\
    \ possible constraints\nor drawbacks.\n•\nThe Manure Manager (MAMA) aims to provide\
    \ optimal decisions, recommenda-\ntions and case studies on the manure management\
    \ in Mixed Farming Systems. The\nutilization of livestock manure to add nutrients\
    \ back to the soil is one of the key crop-\nlivestock interactions in MFS. Manure\
    \ when used as a soil amendment can beneﬁt the\nsoil, resulting in crop production\
    \ and resilience beneﬁts for smallholders via increased\nnutrient supply to crops\
    \ and improved soil structure and water holding capacity.\nManure has well-documented\
    \ impacts on soil chemical and physical properties.\n•\nThe Water Manager (WAMA)\
    \ will be able to make optimal decisions on the water\nmanagement on the MFS.\
    \ Improving water use efﬁciency and water management\non mixed farms is arguably\
    \ the most important and high potential improvement\nfor farmers to be climate-smart.\
    \ Optimal water management strategies increase net\nreturns and purchasing power\
    \ parity of households much more than any other and\nperhaps presents the only\
    \ viable pathway to help transition smallholder farmers out\nof poverty.\nDue\
    \ to the withdrawal of market intervention policies, market volatility has increased,\n\
    causing high income risk for specialized farms. Given that both global agricultural\
    \ markets\nand agricultural policies enhanced efﬁciency in producing more of a\
    \ same product, e.g.,\nfavouring economies of scale through intensiﬁcation, enlargement\
    \ and specialization,\nDiMaRa’s goal is to assist MFS to have the ﬂexibility to\
    \ face uncertain climate and market\nconditions. As a service, the DiMaRa should\
    \ be able to gather market-oriented data from\nseveral sources, while compiling\
    \ it using big data analytics for transforming it to knowledge\nand recommendations.\
    \ The purpose of DiMaRa lies in three axes:\n•\nAggregate accurate and timely\
    \ climate and market information (weather, demand,\nsupply and prices);\n•\nProcess\
    \ and analyze it in a way such that it will be transformed into usable knowledge\n\
    (intelligence) using big data analytics;\n•\nDisseminate it to mixed farming stakeholders\
    \ through web and mobile applications.\nData aggregation could encompass (i) data\
    \ from WCCF, (ii) information about the\nprices of commodities which are directly\
    \ or indirectly related to mixed farming ecosys-\ntems [104], (iii) data from\
    \ Agriculture Market Information Services (AMIS), which consti-\ntute another\
    \ source of interest with rich agriculture-related data [105] and (iv) data coming\n\
    from Google marketing tools such as Google Trends and Google Keyword Tool, which\
    \ will\nbe utilized to capture near-real time data for trends in the ﬁeld of agriculture.\n\
    Moreover, the complete MiFarm-CSA architecture with the four layers and their\n\
    interconnections is illustrated in Figure 3.\nTelecom 2021, 2\n67\nIntegrated\

    4. The Expected Beneﬁts of Mifarm-CSA Architecture\nCSA addresses the challenges\
    \ which climate change poses to agricultural production.\nMiFarm-CSA constitutes\
    \ an efﬁcient CSA-driven architecture which forms a user-oriented,\nsocial-aware\
    \ and ecological platform, deployed as a service. Its main beneﬁts are outlined\n\
    as follows:\n•\nIncreasing agricultural productivity and income while also enhancing\
    \ resilience or\nadaptation of livelihoods and ecosystems towards climate extremes.\
    \ Through the\nIDCON, SECF and MFaS layers, the proposed architecture exploits\
    \ multi-disciplinary,\non-ﬁeld and off-ﬁeld data, to train the novel DSS, thereby\
    \ enabling it to make optimal\ndecisions, which are expected to boost MFS productivity\
    \ and stakeholders’ incomes.\nMoreover, through DiMaRa, MiFarm-CSA is anticipated\
    \ to provide MFS the ﬂexibility\nto face uncertain climate and market conditions.\n\
    •\nIncreasing synergies among different farming systems by adopting new data collection\n\
    and monitoring technologies, such as smart sensors, robots, UAVs, advanced tracking\n\
    systems, long-range IoT-enabled sensors, middleware and gateways. The IDCON\n\
    layer provides the cutting-edge technologies for applications in MFS: IoT sensors,\n\
    devices, modern UAVs and FANETs, which aspire to be fully autonomous and multi-\n\
    collective, supporting, advanced processing and integration functionalities and\
    \ are\ncapable of covering large-scale areas for providing big volumes of data\
    \ in near real\ntime. The autonomy is twofold: the energy autonomy will be accomplished\
    \ by\nTelecom 2021, 2\n68\ndeploying energy harvesting techniques for recharging\
    \ sensors and UAVs and by\ndeﬁning a pilot-sensitive energy-budget approach for\
    \ each data collection technology.\n•\nSpeeding up the establishment of a community\
    \ of practice and dynamic methodology\nin designing, developing and evaluating\
    \ mixed and integrated farming systems.\nMiFarm-CSA adopts innovative human factor\
    \ approaches and methodologies to\nchampion social and behavioral aspects and\
    \ to prioritize the role of the human in the\ntechnological development. By exploiting\
    \ SCOPE in the proposed architecture, the\naim is to facilitate a comparison between\
    \ the current ways in which mixed farming\nand agroforestry are conducted and\
    \ future ways which better account for the socio-\ntechnical system as described\
    \ by SCOPE. This whole approach enables MiFarm-CSA\nto assess the inadequacies\
    \ of the current treatment of social and behavioral issues\nand ensure that the\
    \ emerged outcomes are built around the identiﬁed social and\nbehavioral aspects\
    \ of mixed farming and agroforestry. CoP will involve a multi-actor\nand trans-disciplinary\
    \ group of end users. SLO relates to the continued acceptance\nof a set of business\
    \ practices or operating procedures by a stakeholders. Moreover,\nSLO ensures\
    \ that the technical innovations can be supported by sustained social and\nbehavioral\
    \ change.\n•\nForming a basis for the creation of a conceptual framework to analyze\
    \ crop-livestock\nintegration by fostering core interactions among animals, grasslands\
    \ and crops, de-\nveloping metabolic analysis of material ﬂows, devising a biodiversity\
    \ approach for\nthe development of integrated crop-livestock systems and promoting\
    \ social resources\nand stakeholder interactions.\n•\nPrescribing a rich suite\
    \ of user-friendly MFS applications and services for fostering the\noptimal combination\
    \ of production, accurate climate change estimations and optimal\ndecisions on\
    \ local and national levels.\n5. Case Study\nThe proposed architecture envisages\
    \ upgrading, in terms of sustainability, areas where\ndifferent agricultural systems,\
    \ such as crops, livestock and forestry, coexist. For the purpose\nof the paper,\
    \ a case study was considered in the area of the Western Macedonia, Greece for\n\
    evaluating the components of MiFarm-CSA architecture.\nThe area of interest is\
    \ located in a region of Western Macedonia in Greece, called\nGrevena. It is a\
    \ mountainous area which is surrounded by a forest and includes a wide\nvariety\
    \ of ﬂora, including fruit trees, grapevine, berries and vegetables. Nearby the\
    \ forest,\nthere is rich livestock activity by local farmers. The main challenges\
    \ raised in this area are\nsummarized as follows:\n•\nClimate change has affected\
    \ the biodiversity of the area, having negative impacts on\nthe yield production\
    \ and the soil quality.\n•\nHigh operational and labor costs (energy needs, animal\
    \ feeding) add a lot of pressure\nto farming businesses.\n•\nThe extensive use\
    \ of chemical inputs (fertilizers and pesticides) has negatively affected\nthe\
    \ water cycle.\n•\nThe animal waste management is not sufﬁcient, leading to negative\
    \ environmental\neffects and waste of resources.\n•\nThe lack of forestry woodland\
    \ management results in high risks of things such as\nwildﬁres.\n•\nLow cooperation\
    \ between local farming businesses due to a poor local market.\n•\nA wide skill\
    \ gap between each kind of system, deteriorating the objective of collabora-\n\
    tion considerably.\n•\nTechnological deﬁciencies, as farmers are not aware of\
    \ modern monitoring and surveil-\nlance methods to reduce their labor costs.\n\
    •\nAbsence of local professional groups in MFS rules out the possibility of combining\n\
    local agricultural and livestock practices.\nTelecom 2021, 2\n69\nThese challenges\
    \ hinder the local farmers and stakeholders from further extending and\nutilizing\
    \ their resources. In addition, farmers and stakeholders are quite skeptical towards\n\
    changing—and therefore increasing their proﬁts and sustainability—to a collaborative\n\
    farming scheme such as MFS.\nWithin MiFarm-CSA, the cooperation between the forest,\
    \ the local farms and the\nlocal stakeholders will be fostered by applying the\
    \ EVAM methodology in integrating\nsustainable agriculture, livestock and forestry\
    \ combinations. The rationale behind this lies\nin products’ attractiveness (high\
    \ nutritionally valuable products, longer shelf life of dairy\nproducts), Protected\
    \ Designation of Origin (PDO) products and livestock welfare (animal\nimmunological\
    \ status enhancement and efﬁcient animal breeding systems). Through the\nIDCON\
    \ layer a variety of combinations of mixed farming solutions will be monitored,\n\
    resulting in providing valuable data that can be further analyzed to reveal interesting\n\
    correlations that would be impossible to discover otherwise. Moreover, MiFarm-CSA\n\
    using SECF and MFaS, is expected to reduce the environmental footprint of the\
    \ system,\ndecrease input and management costs and increase the system’s overall\
    \ productivity. In\ndetail, it is expected to contribute to the decrease of atmospheric\
    \ CO2 pollution and to\nthe mitigation of global warming, through the carbon sequestration\
    \ process. In order\nto achieve it, the proposed architecture will exploit forestry\
    \ and managed woodland\nin-between the cultivation and grazing lands and the livestock\
    \ wastes so as to increase\ncarbon sequestration. Moreover, an additional increase\
    \ of the total volume of woodland\nbiomass will further increase the carbon sequestration.\
    \ Furthermore, weed management\ncost is expected to decrease with the use of animal\
    \ grazing, which leads to a reduction\nof machine hours required as an indirect\
    \ measurement of fossil fuel consumption, and\nthe use of mulched woodland material\
    \ can decrease the evaporation of soil water and\nconsequently reduce the irrigation\
    \ water volume. Last but not least, the animal waste usage\nin crop cultivation\
    \ will increase its quality, decrease use of chemicals and also decrease\ntransportation\
    \ costs. Through SECF and MFaS, the mixed treatments will aim to rationalize\n\
    agricultural production; reduce pollution and protect the environment; maintain\
    \ rural\ninfrastructure; and meet emerging social concerns, such as product quality\
    \ and animal\nwelfare. Besides the increases in animal feed supply and system\
    \ productivity, which lead,\non the one hand to income increase, and on the other\
    \ hand to decreases in operational\ncosts, a positive side-effect of this collaboration\
    \ is that job opportunities are expected to\nincrease, since more disciplines\
    \ will be required to handle the system’s complexity.\n6. Conclusions\nThe food\
    \ supply chain is a key strategic sector globally, from both economic and labor\n\
    perspectives. This sector is also critical to meet the great societal challenges\
    \ of sustainable\nfarming, food security, food safety and healthy nutrition, now\
    \ and in the future, which\nconstitute without a doubt the most important priorities\
    \ for both citizens and policy makers.\nNevertheless, agriculture is at a crossroads\
    \ on a global level. The increasing digitalization\nof agricultural practices\
    \ makes it possible to produce plant and animal products with ever\nhigher efﬁciency\
    \ and ever lower environmental impact. Therefore, the agri-food sector\nis expected\
    \ to become more and more data-driven by the use of ICT, while the need for\n\
    AgTech-enabled innovation will become greater than ever. A number of technologies\n\
    not traditionally used in the agri-food sector are now starting to play a key\
    \ role in what\nis perceived as an AgTech revolution. Automation, artiﬁcial intelligence,\
    \ drones, big\ndata and cloud analytics offer us the opportunity to further our\
    \ mastery of agriculture.\nThe Industrial Revolution 4.0 is expected to generate\
    \ disruptive changes in agricultural\npractices and pave the way for new innovative\
    \ ideas that aspire to obtain market share\nfrom a billion dollar market. This\
    \ ICT-revolution is expected to further advance and evolve\nsmart farming/smart\
    \ agriculture, including CSA and precision agriculture.\nIn this work, a multi-actor\
    \ architecture introduced as a reference for the innovative\nconcept of CSA was\
    \ applied in integrated agricultural systems, such as MFS. The proposed\narchitecture\
    \ aims at providing a CSA-based, multi-actor and community-oriented architec-\n\
    Telecom 2021, 2\n70\nture, enhanced with models, tools, frameworks and cutting-edge\
    \ solutions, for advancing\nthe current farming system to a smart, resilient and\
    \ integrated/mixed farming ecosystem,\naiming at increasing the resilience of\
    \ the underlying farms, crops, livestock and forestry\nagainst the negative impacts\
    \ of the climate change. The next step of this work is to conduct\na qualitative\
    \ and quantitative analysis of the performance of the proposed architecture in\n\
    the two pilots, based on speciﬁc KPIs.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization,\

    WSA\nWorld Summit Award\n!III\n1 Introduction \n1.1 Problem statement  \nAccording\
    \ to the 2009 report published by the Food and Agriculture Organization \n(FAO)\
    \ of the United Nations, due to population growth, food production must \nincrease\
    \ by 70% by 2050 to meet rising demand (FAO, 2009). To achieve this aim, \nnew\
    \ technologies are needed. The main source of new technologies is innovation.\
    \ \nThe main creative power behind innovation is entrepreneurship. Schumpeter\
    \ was \none of the first economists to introduce the entrepreneur as the one who\
    \ reforms \nand even revolutionizes the existing production patterns (Schumpeter,\
    \ 1947). The \nrole of entrepreneurs in the economy is to break old sets and create\
    \ new ones. To \ndo so, they use the innovation defined by Schumpeter himself\
    \ as “creative \ndestruction”. In the age of information, entrepreneurial entities\
    \ are called startups. \nStartups disrupt the current economic order and bring\
    \ products to the market that \nencourage new ways of working and production.\
    \ \nAlthough innovation often brings new opportunities and benefits, it is not\
    \ always \nrecognized and accepted by the target group. In the field of agriculture\
    \ farmers are \nbeginning to realize the necessity to change current practices,\
    \ especially since \nchanges in price regulations and subsidy policies do not\
    \ always guarantee a \nstable income, and climate change also influences the amount\
    \ of harvest (Dedieu \net al., 2009). Nevertheless, the diffusion pace of the\
    \ new digital agricultural \nsolutions among farmers is not as rapid as expected\
    \ (EIP-AGRI, 2015). According \nto the Kondratiev waves, an innovation cycle from\
    \ developing a new technology to \nits complete adoption can take 40 to 60 years\
    \ (Grinin et al., 2016). A historical \nexample in the field of agriculture that\
    \ might support this assumption is the \nimplementation of new practices and technologies,\
    \ such as new ploughing \nmethods or breeding selection. These and further innovations\
    \ were the basis of an \nEnglish agricultural revolution that started in the middle\
    \ of the 17th century and \nreached its peak in the 18th century (Mingay, 1963).\
    \ \nToday the pace of innovation adoption plays a critical role when considering\
    \ the \ngrowing demand for efficient and healthy food production. Two parties\
    \ are \n!1\nresponsible for the pace of innovation adoption: the users of the\
    \ innovation and \nthe innovators, although the user is the one who decides to\
    \ accept an innovation \nor not. Therefore an entrepreneur has a strong financial\
    \ interest in bringing a \nproduct or service onto the market that is embraced\
    \ by the customers. Despite the \nimportance of the entrepreneurs’ role in the\
    \ process of innovation adoption, most \nof the studies in the field of agriculture\
    \ until now focused on the adoption \nstrategies employed by the end-users - farmers\
    \ (Pierpaoli et al., 2013) That is why \nthe research presented here will concentrate\
    \ on the side of the innovators - \nagricultural startups. Analyzing this topic\
    \ from the perspective of the agricultural \nstartups can deliver additional understanding\
    \ on the strategies that are needed to \nsupport an adoption of the innovations\
    \ in the field of agriculture, which therefore \nmight positively contribute to\
    \ the increase in food production by 2050. \n1.2 Objectives and research method\
    \  \nThe main objective of this research is to investigate marketing strategies\
    \ that \ndigital agricultural startups use to achieve critical mass on the market.\
    \ The \nproblem of the digitalization of agriculture is common to industrial and\
    \ \nindustrialized countries (EIP-AGRI, 2015; Lele, 2017). As previously mentioned,\
    \ \nsince most studies in the field of agriculture about the diffusion of innovation\
    \ are \nconcentrated on the customer (farmer) side and customers’ attitudes towards\
    \ new \ntechnologies (Pierpaoli et al., 2013), this work will focus on the companies’\
    \ side to \nsee if there are additional components to the diffusion of innovation\
    \ theories that \nare not directly connected to the customer perspective. To begin\
    \ with, digital \nagricultural startups will be defined and categorized. In the\
    \ next step, a theoretical \noverview will follow. This should lead to the identification\
    \ of the most important \ntheoretical frameworks that are commonly used in the\
    \ studies about innovation \nacceptance. This theoretical framework will serve\
    \ as a guideline to the first \nqualitative inquiry of its kind that will be conducted\
    \ with digital agricultural startups.  \nThe qualitative method enables one to\
    \ acquire deeper expertise regarding the \ntopic; it helps discover new relations\
    \ in the subject (Strauss and Corbin, 1998). \nAfter obtaining input about the\
    \ marketing strategies of startups and their \nperception of the situation on\
    \ the agricultural market, a new inquiry will be \n!2\nconducted. The new inquiry\
    \ will test hypotheses based on the theory and new \nfindings from previous qualitative\
    \ inquiries to discover what kind of strategies are \nused in the startups that\
    \ have already achieved critical mass. \nThe second qualitative inquiry will focus\
    \ on the startups that offer farm \nmanagement information systems in Germany.\
    \ This technology was selected \nbecause it represents an element of the field\
    \ called precision farming. Precision \nfarming is one of the technologies that\
    \ promises to increase the quantity and \nquality of future agricultural output,\
    \ and at the same time, generate a positive \nimpact on the environment (Schrijver\
    \ et al., 2016). This type of smart farming \ntechnology is also supported by\
    \ the European Union, through diverse policies and \nfunding tools. Therefore,\
    \ it may also be interesting to discover whether any of the \nstartups that work\
    \ in the area will mention governmental policies as an additional \nsupport for\
    \ achieving higher market penetration. \nThe design of this research is based\
    \ on the post-positivist approach. In this theory, \nit is believed that the world\
    \ is complex and that there is no single truth (O’Leary, \n2004, p.6). Post-positivist\
    \ research uses explorative methods to capture reality; it \nfocuses on the system\
    \ itself instead of certain small parts of it. The specific nature \nof this type\
    \ of research is that the results are not always reproducible. However, \nthere\
    \ are particular verification methods for it, as well as a transparent explication\
    \ \nof methods used to gather and analyze the data. Often, results obtained with\
    \ the \npost-positivist method are used to develop a new theory or to offer a\
    \ new \ngeneralizing approach that could be used in other areas beyond the field\
    \ being \nresearched.\P\n!3\n2 The digital agricultural startup market \nClimate\
    \ change and a growing population have made governments in various \ncountries\
    \ change the way agriculture currently works. Digitalization creates new \nways\
    \ to produce and distribute food. The process of transformation in the \nagricultural\
    \ sector has attracted startups that aim to introduce some of these digital \n\
    technologies to new fields. According to the investment platform AgFunder, in\
    \ \n2017, approximately $10 billion were invested in agri-tech startups. The amount\
    \ \ninvested grew by nearly 30% in comparison with 2016. Of these $10 billion,\
    \ \napproximately $2 billion were invested in startups that develop farm technologies.\
    \ \nApproximately half of the $10 billion investment was aimed at online marketplaces\
    \ \nand online shops for the agricultural products. In 2017, the investment in\
    \ this \nsector also experienced a 30% increase. \nFigure 1: Financing of the\
    \ farm technologies 2014-2017 (in $ billion) (Source: AgFunder, \n2017) \nIn addition\
    \ to startup investment, there are various scientific projects, such as \n“Hands\
    \ Free Hectare” in the UK, or pilot projects and consulting programs with the\
    \ \nuse of the latest technology sponsored by the European Commission, all of\
    \ which \nattempt to encourage farmers to start using digital technologies. The\
    \ European \n!4\n0\n0,65\n1,3\n1,95\n2,6\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2,6\n1,9\n1,8\n\
    1,5\nInnovation Partnership for Agriculture (EIP-AGRI) is a special initiative\
    \ of the EU \nCommission that, among other tasks, brings innovators into the context\
    \ of rural \ndevelopment. Another country that has announced digitalization of\
    \ the agricultural \nsector as a part of their national policy is India. India\
    \ is considered one of the most \nimportant global suppliers of agricultural products\
    \ (Seth and Ganguly, 2017). More \nthan 50% of the Indian population is involved\
    \ in agriculture to sustain their \nlivelihoods (Indian Ministry of Agriculture\
    \ and Farmers Welfare, 2018). Political \nsupport of agri-tech has boosted investors’\
    \ interest in this sector. In 2016, \naccording to the Global Innovation Index,\
    \ 34 ventures received $295 million in \nfunding, which is “the highest investment\
    \ amount recorded in India” (Seth and \nGanguly, 2017, p.107). The policy changes\
    \ in India in 2015 had a direct impact on \nthe number of agri-tech startups.\
    \ According to the data provided by the Indian \nMinistry of Agriculture and Farmers\
    \ Welfare, there was a boom in the number of \nnew agricultural ventures from\
    \ 2014 - 2016. 2015 was the year with the highest \nnumber of newly- founded agri-tech\
    \ startups. \nFigure 2: Number of the agri-tech startups founded in India 2007-2017\
    \ (Source: Indian \nMinistry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, 2018) \nIn 2016\
    \ the International consulting company Deloitte distinguished five \nagricultural\
    \ trends that should attract investment in the future: food e-commerce, \n!5\n\

    \ bio-chemicals and bio-energy, food technology such \nas meat substitutes, as\
    \ well as contained and vertical farming. Most of these \ntrends represent an\
    \ alternative to classical farming, aiming at making it more \nsustainable. The\
    \ pursuit of these new forms of farming are based on the negative \nimpact of\
    \ traditional farming that causes soil degradation, produces greenhouse \ngases,\
    \ reduces biodiversity and makes some coastal areas unsuitable to life due \n\
    to the extensive use of fertilizers (Goedde et al., 2016). To reduce this negative\
    \ \nimpact, these new alternative farming models are becoming popular:  \n•\n\
    Urban fields: abandoned industrial areas transformed into farmland; \n•\nGreenhouses:\
    \ hydroponics and rooftop greenhouses; \n•\nVertical farms; \n•\nSea farming.\
    \ \nIn Italy, for example, according to the statistics from 2017, 50% of all agri-tech\
    \ \nstartups in the area of smart agriculture focused on environmental technologies;\
    \ \n35% of them are concentrating on precision farming (Statista, 2018). In the\
    \ United \nStates, urban gardening is receiving substantial funding and new ambitious\
    \ \nprojects are getting started, e.g. the American startup Iron Ox, which created\
    \ an \n8,000-square-foot indoor farm to produce lettuce and herbs, and employs\
    \ robots \ninstead of humans to harvest. The robots are controlled by a program\
    \ called \n“Brain”. This program monitors growing conditions and brings all the\
    \ nutrients \ninvolved into balance (Vincent, 2018). Another trend comprises of\
    \ vertical farms, \nwhich should save costs and optimize the output. In Japan,\
    \ one of the largest \nvertical farms in the world produces 30,000 heads of lettuce\
    \ per day, according to \nthe farm’s website (Technofarm, 2018). In the United\
    \ States, vertical gardening is \nalso being taken seriously: the startup Plenty\
    \ received $200 million (until now the \nlargest agri-tech investment) to build\
    \ several towers that are used to grow lettuce \nand herbs. The towers will be\
    \ equipped with LED lamps, cameras and sensors to \nmonitor plant growth (Roberts,\
    \ 2018). The data collected at such vertical \nwarehouses should be used by agronomists\
    \ who, along with artificial intelligence \nexperts, should develop algorithms\
    \ to improve the vertical farming system. \n!6\n2.1 Definition and classification\
    \ of digital agricultural startups \nLately, the word startup has been appearing\
    \ more often in the press; almost all \nnew ventures are currently being termed\
    \ as “startup”. However, is it true that these \ndays, all new ventures are startups?\
    \ Are there any specific characteristics to \ndistinguish a startup from other\
    \ new ventures on the market? The first definition of \nthe term could be tracked\
    \ back to 1979: it was defined as a stage where a \ndecision about founding a\
    \ company and how to position it on the market is made \n(Schendel et al., 1979).\
    \ In the late ´90s, this term was used to refer to newly-\nfounded companies that\
    \ deal with electronic technologies and the Internet. One of \nthe typical characteristics\
    \ of those ventures was growth speed – so-called \nscalability. Scalability means\
    \ that the business could be easily expanded with \nminimal costs. Scalability\
    \ became possible thanks to information technology that \nmakes marginal costs\
    \ almost equal to zero and eliminates classical distribution \ncosts. Eric Ries,\
    \ with his book “Lean Startup”, popularized the ways startups \ndeveloped innovations\
    \ and brought them onto the market in the early 2000s. From \nhis perspective,\
    \ “a startup is a human institution designed to create a new product \nor service\
    \ under conditions of extreme uncertainty” (Ries, 2011, p.37). The key \nword\
    \ in this definition is uncertainty. From Ries’s perspective, startups challenge\
    \ \nexisting rules on the market and are open to experimenting. They do something\
    \ \ncompletely new that did not, up until that point, exist on the market. This\
    \ means \nthat from Eric Ries’s perspective, if one opened another online shop\
    \ today, it would \nnot be a startup anymore, because the processes of opening\
    \ an online shop and \nmaking sales through this channel already exist. One would\
    \ just replicate those for \none’s product. Therefore, there is no uncertainty\
    \ about how to do this and how it is \ngoing to be accepted. \nWith time, startups\
    \ became part of the statistical observation indirectly showing the \ninnovativeness\
    \ of a country or region. Through implementing different kinds of \nmonitors to\
    \ keep track of these new ventures, new definitions also appeared. For \nexample,\
    \ the European startup monitor describes startups as companies that are \nyounger\
    \ than 10 years, offer innovative technologies and / or business models and \n\
    have significant employee and / or sales growth (Kollmann et al., 2016). In India,\
    \ \nthe government, with the launch of its initiative “Startup India, Standup\
    \ India”, \n!7\nofficially defined a startup as a business entity that is younger\
    \ than 7 years (10 \nyears for biotechnology startups) and is registered as a\
    \ Limited Liability \nPartnership with a turnover of less than approximately 3175\
    \ EUR  for any of the \n1\nfinancial years. Another criterion is that it must\
    \ work on innovations or \nimprovement of its products / services. It must also\
    \ have a scalable business \nmodel (Startup India, 2018). In the United States,\
    \ there is no official definition of a \nstartup, though there are specific policies\
    \ to support this type of company, such as \n“The Startup America Initiative”,\
    \ developed under the Obama government \n(National Economic Council, 2011). All\
    \ the definitions presented above have one \ncommon element: innovativeness. Startups\
    \ are young companies that challenge \nthe existing processes and products on\
    \ the market and bring a certain degree of \n“creative disruption” (Schumpeter,\
    \ 1947). However, since research presented here \nhas a particular interest in\
    \ digital startups, another important element will be \nconsidered for the definition:\
    \ scalability. For the purpose of this analysis, a \n“startup” will be defined\
    \ as a new venture that offers scalable innovation in the \nform of new services,\
    \ products, processes or business models and that has been \non the market for\
    \ no longer than 5 years. \nNow, using this definition of the term “startup”,\
    \ it is important to understand the \ntypes of technologies agricultural startups\
    \ are dealing with. To do so, an overview \nof the existing and upcoming digital\
    \ agricultural technologies will be presented \nbelow. The AgFunder Investment\
    \ Platform (2017) suggested 13 categories of \nagricultural innovations, among\
    \ which are: \n•\nAg Biotechnology (genetics, microbiome, breeding etc.); \n•\n\
    Farm Management Software, Sensing and Internet of Things (data collection, \n\
    data analysis and support for on-farm site decisions); \n•\nFarm Robotics, Mechanization\
    \ and Equipment (automation, drones, planting \nequipment); \n•\nBioenergy and\
    \ Biomaterials (non-food extraction and processing); \n•\nNovel farming systems\
    \ (indoor farms, aquaculture, insect and water plants \nfarms);  \n•\nSupply Chain\
    \ Technologies (traceability tech, logistics); \n The currency exchange rate on\
    \ 1 December 2018\n1\n!8\n•\nAgribusiness Marketplaces (commodity trading platforms,\
    \ online input); \n•\nInnovation food (cultured meat, novel ingredients); \n•\n\
    In-Store Retail and Restaurant Tech (Self-stacking robots, 3D food printers \n\
    food waste monitoring); \n•\nRestaurant Marketplaces (Tech platforms delivering\
    \ food); \n•\neGrocery (online shops and marketplaces for the sale and delivery\
    \ of \nagricultural products to consumers); \n•\nHome and Cooking Tech (smart\
    \ kitchen appliances, nutrition tech); \n•\nOnline Restaurant and Meal Kits (pre-portioned\
    \ ingredients to cook at home). \nThe Organization for Economic Co-Operation and\
    \ Development (2018) sees \nagricultural innovations as an effective way to globally\
    \ sustain a high quality of \nfood. One of the technologies that should contribute\
    \ to this aim is precision \nfarming. In the Scientific Foresight Study prepared\
    \ by the European Parliamentary \nResearch Service, precision farming was defined\
    \ as “a modern farming \nmanagement concept using digital techniques to monitor\
    \ and optimize agricultural \nproduction processes” (Schrijver et al., 2016, p.4).\
    \ This technology should help to \n“increase the quantity and quality of agricultural\
    \ output while using less \ninput” (Schrijver et al., 2016, p.4). In this way,\
    \ precision farming should not only \nsolve the problem of food supply but also\
    \ have a positive impact on the \nenvironment. According to the Global Innovation\
    \ Index 2017, digital agriculture is \n“a deployment of computational and information\
    \ technologies in farming which will \nplay a key role in achieving innovation\
    \ goals” (van Es and Woodard, 2017, p.97). \nThis type of technology should optimize\
    \ and individualize all the processes within \nagriculture. According to the Association\
    \ for European Agricultural Machinery \n(CEMA, 2017), precision farming is only\
    \ a part of the digital evolution of \nagriculture, because the final target is\
    \ a connected, knowledge-based production \nsystem. In other words, the precision\
    \ farming concept is only a small part of digital \nagriculture, wherein one of\
    \ the ultimate goals is optimal decision functions that \nhelp to better assess\
    \ and manage agricultural risk (Shen et al., 2010, p.42). \nFor the purpose of\
    \ this research, digital agricultural technologies will be defined in \naccordance\
    \ with the definition of the Global Innovation Index as “a deployment of \n!9\n\
    computational and information technologies” that should optimize and individualize\
    \ \nthe agricultural processes (van Es and Woodard, 2017, p.97). For the initial\
    \ \nqualitative inquiry, this definition will be used to select startups worldwide\
    \ for the \ninterviews. For the following investigation of marketing strategies\
    \ of the startups \nthat achieved critical mass, precision farming as the most\
    \ supported and \npromising technology shall be selected. \n2.2 The role of startups\
    \ in the digitalization process of the agricultural \nindustry \nAnother important\
    \ question is: what role do agricultural startups play in the \ndigitalization\
    \ process? Why do already existing major corporations not lead the \nprocess of\
    \ agricultural transformation? One of the biggest differences between \ncorporations\
    \ and startups is the structure. A startup has almost no hierarchy, which \nmakes\
    \ the decision-making process agile. Agility is an important quality if one \n\
    works under conditions that change rapidly. Moreover, startups, from the very\
    \ \nbeginning, are customer-oriented because they need to survive on the market.\
    \ To \ndo so, they work hard to recognize and satisfy customer needs (Owens and\
    \ \nFernandez, 2014, p.14). They learn quickly from their failures and, accordingly,\
    \ \nadjust their products. Ries called this type of work “lean startup” (Ries,\
    \ 2011). \nAlthough the lean concept originates from the Toyota corporation, this\
    \ way of \nworking was more rapidly adopted by startups than by other corporations\
    \ (Ries, \n2011). This agile way of working is a necessity when a completely new\
    \ product is \nlaunched on the market. Since there is no similar product or process,\
    \ it is hard to \nforecast customer reaction; this means that a company should\
    \ be ready to change \nthe original product and adapt it to the market demand.\
    \ \nLooking at the last 20 years and the most commonly used technologies today,\
    \ \nsuch as the Google search engine, the first personal computer, Microsoft Office\
    \ or \nAmazon, all these technologies were brought to the market by startups.\
    \ Another \naspect that unites these companies is the attitude toward supporting\
    \ creativity. \nAccording to Martins’ and Terblanche’s model (2003), there are\
    \ several \ndeterminants that influence the level of a company’s innovativeness.\
    \ These \ndeterminants are often reflected exactly in startup companies. The table\
    \ below \n!10\nshows the key determinants of a company’s culture that support\
    \ creativity and \ninnovation. \nTable 1: Determinants of organizational culture\
    \ that influence innovation and creativity \n(adopted from Martins and Terblanche,\
    \ 2003) \nSome larger corporations have already realized the importance of the\
    \ startup \nculture and try to imitate it. However, oftentimes, the corporations\
    \ just copy the \nouter attributes of the startups, such as office design, without\
    \ taking along the \nintangible values like culture and mind-set (Owens and Fernandez,\
    \ 2014, p.13). \nAccording to an article in the Harvard Business Review, the once-successful\
    \ \ncompany Kodak could not embrace the innovations on the market because there\
    \ \nwas no company culture supporting it and the management did not really \n\
    recognize the opportunities of the new trends and did not support their own \n\
    innovative technologies (Anthony, 2016). \nEntrepreneurs are famous for recognizing\
    \ new market opportunities. Their ability \nto do this is so extraordinary that\
    \ it became subject of a research field (Baron, \n2006, p.104). To attract the\
    \ attention of entrepreneurs to such a conservative field \nas agriculture, governments\
    \ in various countries launched special programs to \nattract investors and to\
    \ provide certain funds to develop new technologies. India is \none of the countries\
    \ that officially proclaimed their readiness to digitalize rural \ncommunities\
    \ in 2015 (Bergvinson, 2017). To track the changes due to this new \nStrategy\n\

    !11\nIndian government policy, one must observe the entrepreneurial development\
    \ in \nthis sector. The Indian Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare published\
    \ the \nfirst statistics about startups in the agricultural sector. According\
    \ to this statistical \ndata, there are several agricultural startup hubs in India\
    \ in different regions, e.g. \nMaharashtra, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, where\
    \ more than 150 startups have \ntheir headquarters (Indian Ministry of Agriculture\
    \ and Farmers Welfare, 2018).  \nSome Indian newspapers are slowly collecting\
    \ the first success stories from the \nfarmers in these regions, who are starting\
    \ to implement new technologies such as \nsolar-powered cool storage, which helps\
    \ preserve the products longer and, \ntherefore, helps farmers negotiate better\
    \ prices. Another new technology is the \nlow-cost irrigation controller, which\
    \ has so far been installed in 65 farms in the \nKarnataka and Andhra Pradesh\
    \ regions (Shankar and Vignesh, 2016). However, it \nis important to mention that\
    \ without additional infrastructural support, which the \nIndian government is\
    \ offering, such changes would hardly be possible. The \ngovernment started such\
    \ projects as “digital villages“ (“A Digi Goan”), which \nprovides high-speed\
    \ connectivity and wi-fi hot spots in rural areas (The Economic \nTimes, 2018).\
    \ After the first 6 pilot projects, the Indian government plans to \nimplement\
    \ internet connectivity in 700 villages across the whole country (Shankar \nand\
    \ Vignesh, 2016). The general impact of the agricultural startups on \ndigitalization\
    \ is still difficult to properly estimate, not only because of the scarce \namount\
    \ of statistical data, but also because of the different governmental policies\
    \ \nthat support certain types of technology or certain regions at a different\
    \ rate. They \nalso define what kinds of companies could be called “startups”\
    \ differently. Thus, it \nis hard to say whether farmers started using this technology\
    \ because they \nrecognize its benefits or because the government pushed it and\
    \ subsidized the \nstartups that produce it. \n2.3 Challenges of startups on the\
    \ way to critical mass \nAccording to the McKinsey report, the first investments\
    \ in agri-tech were \nundertaken as early as 2004 (Goedde et al., 2015). However,\
    \ 14 years later there \nare few technologies that have a high market penetration\
    \ rate. \n!12\nFigure 3: Global agricultural Internet of Things market size, by\
    \ application in % for 2016 \nand predicted for 2022 (Source: Statista) \nAccording\
    \ to the statistics, the most promising smart agriculture technologies \nworldwide\
    \ are yield monitoring and precision irrigation (Figure 3). Meanwhile, there \n\
    are technologies such as field mapping or crop scouting that, according to the\
    \ \nstatistics, will stagnate in the upcoming years.  \nThe stagnation and lack\
    \ of technology acceptance represent one of the biggest \nchallenges for agricultural\
    \ startups. Among precision farming technologies, \naccording to the forecast\
    \ prepared by Statista, precision fertilizers will be the \nmarket segment with\
    \ the highest market volume by 2050 (Figure 4). Moisture \nsensing and precision\
    \ sensing will have the lowest market volume. It is interesting \nthat although\
    \ precision irrigation currently has the highest market penetration rate, \nits\
    \ market value by 2050 will be much lower than the one of precision fertilizers\

    \ challenge, which encompasses many different \nfactors that will be presented\
    \ in more detail in the following chapter, there are \ngeneral challenges for\
    \ startups. These challenges must be met in order for \nstartups to survive on\
    \ the market, independent of the industry involved. \nAccording to the consulting\
    \ agency Startup Genome, which tries to find answers to \nthe question of what\
    \ makes startups succeed or fail, it was discovered that 90% of \nall startups\
    \ do not survive on the market (Marmer et al., 2011). The consulting \nagency\
    \ CB Insights investigated 101 post-mortem stories of startups and \nmanaged to\
    \ identify the top 20 reasons why startups fail. The most important \nreason,\
    \ causing more than 40% of startups to shut down their activities, is that \n\
    they could not correctly estimate the market need. According to the EIP-AGRI \n\
    (2015), composed of 19 experts in the field of agriculture, one of the main reasons\
    \ \nwhy famers in the EU do not use precision farming is that they do not see\
    \ the \nbenefits of the technology. Properly presenting the benefits of the technology\
    \ that \nmatch the farmers’ needs seems to be one of the crucial tasks that agricultural\
    \ \nstartups need to consider if they want to survive and achieve critical mass\
    \ on the \nmarket. Below, all 20 reasons discovered by CB Insights are presented.\

    \ and critical mass \nCritical mass is the outcome of innovation acceptance. That\
    \ is why, firstly, it is \nimportant to understand the concept of innovation acceptance,\
    \ since the existence \nof critical mass depends on it. \n3.1 Main theories about\
    \ the acceptance of innovation \nIn the research presented here, special attention\
    \ will be paid to the four basic and \nmost used models in scientific literature:\
    \ Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), \nUnified Theory of Acceptance and Use of\
    \ Technology (UTAUT), Theory of Planned \nBehavior (TPB), and Theory on Diffusion\
    \ of Innovation (DOI). Although there are \ncurrently more models for the prediction\
    \ of technology acceptance, the ones cited \nhere have often been the basis for\
    \ the development of models meant to calculate \nthe rate of innovation adoption\
    \ (Taherdoost, 2018). \nThe first synthesized theory that explained what factors\
    \ play a decisive role in the \ntechnology adoption process was created by Everett\
    \ Rogers in 1962. To develop \nthe Theory on Diffusion of Innovation, Rogers used\
    \ several disciplines such as \nsociology, communication, anthropology and economics.\
    \ Thanks to the \ninterdisciplinary approach, Rogers (1983) adapts a critical\
    \ mass phenomenon that \noriginally comes from sociology to explain and to quantify\
    \ the moment when \ninnovation could count as having been accepted by the users.\
    \ \nThe Theory of Planned Behavior and the Technology Acceptance Theory have \n\
    their roots in the Theory of Reasoned Action (Venkatesh and Davis, 1996; Ajzen,\
    \ \n1991). The Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) was developed by Ajzen and \nFishbein\
    \ in 1975 and explained the behavioral intention or, in the present case, \ndecision\
    \ to start using technology due to two factors: information and silent beliefs.\
    \ \nInformation influences the attitude of a person toward a technology; silent\
    \ beliefs \nare part of our subjective norms that could be, for example, general\
    \ perceptions of \na technology’s usefulness. Ten years later, in 1985, Icek Ajzen\
    \ added a new \ncomponent to TRA. Thus, the Theory of Planned Behavior was born.\
    \ TRA and \nTPB both originate from psychology. That is why the initial research\
    \ fields of TPB \n!16\nwere human habits, especially bad ones, like smoking and\
    \ drinking. With time, the \nnumber of application fields grew, including the\
    \ field of innovation adoption \nbehavior.  \nThe Technology Acceptance Model\
    \ was first suggested by Davis (1989) in his \ndissertation in the area of economics.\
    \ TAM aimed to explain what factors influence \nthe adoption of information technologies\
    \ using psychological elements. Over time, \nthis model was modified and enhanced\
    \ several times, involving more determinants \nto increase its explanation potential.\
    \ One of such models will be presented below. \nFinally, the last model, the Unified\
    \ Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology, \npresented by Venkatesh et al.\
    \ in 2003, represents the latest synthesized theory \nmeant to explain the adoption\
    \ of innovations. It includes components of the \nmodels presented above and their\
    \ modifications, as well as two additional models \nfrom social psychology. \n\
    3.1.1 Diffusion of Innovation \nThe theory about the Diffusion of Innovation was\
    \ the first interdisciplinary theory \nthat tried to explain what factors influence\
    \ the decision to accept an innovation. \nWithin this theory, it is possible to\
    \ separate several important groups of factors that \ninfluence the adoption process:\
    \ technology aspects and the channels employed to \nreach potential users. \n\
    From the technological perspective, Rogers (1983) identified five important \n\
    characteristics that a new technology should have to be accepted by potential\
    \ \nusers: relative advantage, compatibility, complexity, trialability and observability.\
    \  \nRelative advantage is a user perspective of the benefits that a new technology\
    \ \nprovides. To measure relative advantage, not only economic indicators such\
    \ as \nyield gain or cost reduction could be used but also intangible determinants\
    \ such as \nsatisfaction or convenience. “The greater the perceived relative advantage\
    \ of an \ninnovation, the more rapid its rate of adoption is going to be” (Rogers,\
    \ 1983, p.15). \n!17\nThe next criterion is compatibility, which represents a\
    \ degree of consistency with \nexisting norms and values in the social system.\
    \ The higher the compatibility is, the \nhigher the odds that the innovation will\
    \ be accepted. The level of perceived \ndifficulty to understand or use the technology\
    \ is defined as complexity. Rogers \n(1983) writes that generally, the innovations\
    \ that are easy to understand are \nadopted rapidly, in comparison to the ones\
    \ where one must acquire new skills or \nknowledge. Trialability could be described\
    \ as an opportunity to try the innovation \non a certain, limited basis without\
    \ a commitment to acquire it. This opportunity \ndecreases the level of uncertainty\
    \ about the technology. Uncertainty plays a crucial \nrole in the innovation-decision\
    \ process, because, as Rogers (1983) describes, “it is \nessentially an information-seeking\
    \ and information-processing activity in which the \nindividual is motivated to\
    \ reduce uncertainty about the advantages and \ndisadvantages of the innovation.”\
    \ The last criterion is observability, which is \ndefined as a certain degree\
    \ of result visibility. Some of the criteria suggested by \nRogers (1983) can\
    \ also be found in the TAM and in TPB. \nThe role of these five characteristics\
    \ of innovation were tested in various studies in \nthe field of agriculture.\
    \ In the study about Cambodian farmers who should adopt \nrhizobium bacteria,\
    \ Farquharson et al. (2013) found out that only two factors out of \nfive suggested\
    \ by Rogers (1983) were significant: relative advantage and \nobservability. In\
    \ the study about the adoption of integrated pest management by \ncotton farmers\
    \ in India, 99% of the variance could also be explained by two \ncharacteristics\
    \ of the model: relative advantage and level of complexity (Peshin, \n2013). These\
    \ two innovations have different backgrounds: one represents a \nbiological innovation\
    \ and the other a technological. This could mean that for the \ndifferent types\
    \ of innovation, one or the other characteristic can play a more \nimportant role,\
    \ but relative advantage, independent of the innovation, appears to \nbe a significant\
    \ criterion. \nA further important factor influencing the diffusion process is\
    \ the channels that \ncompanies use to acquire new customers. According to Rogers\
    \ (1983), there are \ntwo major important channels to spread information about\
    \ an innovation: mass \nmedia and interpersonal channels. These channels play\
    \ an important role in the \n!18\ndecision-making process, because the first step\
    \ before a decision is made is \ngaining knowledge about the innovation. This\
    \ is followed by persuasion, which is \nbased on the individual’s attitude toward\
    \ the innovation. Rogers (1983) separated \ntwo groups of “knowers of innovation”:\
    \ earlier and later knowers. These types of \nknowers have different exposures\
    \ to the knowledge sources and different levels of \ntrust in different sources\
    \ of knowledge. The earlier knowers have a higher \nexposure to the knowledge\
    \ from mass media, change agents and interpersonal \nchannels due to larger personal\
    \ networks in comparison with later knowers. But \nknowing about the innovation\
    \ is not enough if the potential user does not \nrecognize its usefulness. Based\
    \ on these two important components of the theory, \nit is possible to represent\
    \ the model for decisions-to-adopt as following: \nFigure 6: Factors that influence\
    \ the decision to adopt according to Rogers (1983)  \n3.1.2 Theory of Planned\
    \ Behavior \nAnother important theory in the area of innovation acceptance is\
    \ the Theory of \nPlanned Behavior (TPB) that has its roots in psychology. TPB\
    \ is an extension \nmodel of the Theory of Reasoned Action that was developed\
    \ by Fishbein and \n!19\nAjzen (1975). Both models explain behavior based on the\
    \ intention that it is \ninfluenced by certain determinants like attitude and\
    \ social perceptions. In addition, \nTPB has determinant-perceived behavioral\
    \ control. TPB explains the individual’s \nbehavior as “a joint function of intentions\
    \ and perceived behavioral control” (Ajzen, \n1991, p.185). \nIntentions are “indicators\
    \ of how hard people are willing to try, of how much of an \neffort they are planning\
    \ to exert, in order to perform their behavior” (Ajzen, 1991, p. \n181). Behavioral\
    \ control is a person’s perception of his/her resources and/or \nopportunities\
    \ (like money, time, skills etc.) that dictate his/her behavior. Basically, \n\
    Ajzen (1991) writes that these two components of human behavior are nothing but\
    \ \nmotivation and the ability to do something. When behavioral control is low,\
    \ then \nbehavior mostly depends on intention. Intention is described by Ajzen\
    \ (1991) as \ninfluenced by three independent determinants: attitude, subjective\
    \ norm and \nperceived behavioral control. At the same time behavior control can\
    \ also directly \ninfluence behavior. \nAttitude is defined as the level of individual\
    \ estimation of certain questions/\nsituations. Attitude is determined by the\
    \ belief of an individual about the outcomes \nof certain behavior and his/her\
    \ own personal beliefs.  \nSubjective norm represents the level of social influence\
    \ on the performance of an \nindividual. This component is influenced by the normative\
    \ beliefs and the \nmotivation to comply with them.  \nThe third determinant that\
    \ influences intention is perceived control, which “is \ndetermined by control\
    \ beliefs concerning the presence or absence of facilitators \nand barriers to\
    \ behavioral performance, weighted by their perceived power or the \nimpact of\
    \ each control factor to facilitate or inhibit the behavior” (Glanz et al., 2008,\
    \ \np.71). The decision-making process described by Ajzen (1991) could be presented\
    \ \nas follows : \n!20\nFigure 7: Factors that influence the decision to adopt.\
    \ Modified model of Icek Ajzen  \nTo use TPB, certain conditions should be considered:\
    \ 1) the context in which \nbehavior takes place stays the same; 2) intentions\
    \ and behavioral control do not \nchange in the assessment interval; 3) the perception\
    \ of behavioral control reflects \na realistic control. It is also important to\
    \ define target, action, context and time in \nwhich behavior takes place. Ajzen\
    \ also developed a special construct for creating \nTPB questionnaires that includes\
    \ examples of questions for the measurement of \nattitude, perceived norm, perceived\
    \ behavioral control, intention and past behavior. \nFor the measurement, a Likert\
    \ scale with 7 points is used, which ranges, for \nexample, from “extremely good\
    \ to extremely bad” or “strongly agree to strongly \ndisagree” . \n2\nThe TBP\
    \ model was widely spread in the health studies in the past which analyzed \n\
    unhealthy habits such as smoking and drinking, for example (Glanz et al., 2008).\
    \ \nIn agriculture, TBP was used to test the acceptance of various innovations\
    \ or \npractices, e.g. for the adoption of soil conservation (Wauters et al.,\
    \ 2010), \nacceptance of organic farming (Hattam 2006; Läpple and Kelley, 2010),\
    \ adoption \nof improved grasslands (Borges et al., 2014), conservation (Beedell\
    \ and Rehman, \n1999), animal welfare practices (Lauwere et al., 2012; Bruijnis\
    \ et al., 2013), tree \nplanting (Zubair and Garforth, 2006; Meijer et al., 2015)\
    \ and water conservation \n2 A sample questionnaire is available on the website\
    \ of University of Massachusetts Amherst http://\npeople.umass.edu/aizen/pdf/tpb.questionnaire.pdf\
    \ (04.12.2018)\n!21\npractices (Yazdanpanah et al., 2014). In the study conducted\
    \ by Wauters et al. \n(2010), for example, the TPB established the variance of\
    \ the acceptance of soil \npreservation at between 44% and 70%. In the study about\
    \ tree-planting, Zubair \nand Garforth (2006) confirmed that the theory offers\
    \ a structured and replicable \nframework that helps predict behavior based on\
    \ beliefs, social referents and \nperceived behavioral control. \n3.1.3 Technology\
    \ Acceptance Model \nThe Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) has two main components\
    \ that explain \nthe adoption of a technology: perceived usefulness and the perceived\
    \ ease of use \n(Davis,1989). The first component of the model, usefulness, is\
    \ defined as a level of \nan individual’s perception about the impact of an innovation\
    \ used on his or her job \nperformance. If an individual believes that an innovation\
    \ has a positive impact on \nhis/her performance, then it is defined as useful.\
    \ The second component of the \nmodel, ease of use, is based on the individual’s\
    \ perception of the amount of \nphysical or mental effort that must be invested\
    \ in order to use the innovation. In \nother words, each individual measures the\
    \ benefits that could be obtained using \nthe technology and the obstacles to\
    \ using the technology, because each individual \nhas a limited quantity of effort\
    \ that he/she is prepared to invest in it. \nThese two components were selected\
    \ by Davis (1989) based on previous \nresearch and studies, where different scales\
    \ were applied to find significant factors \nthat had an impact on the decision-making\
    \ process. Perceived ease of use was \nselected based on research about self-efficacy,\
    \ where it was presented as “the \nbasic determinant of user behavior\" (Davis,\
    \ 1989, p.321). Self-efficacy is a \npersonal estimation of how well an individual\
    \ can execute certain actions to \nachieve certain results. Davis (1989) excluded\
    \ the cost-benefit approach from the \nmodel based on the theoretical suggestions\
    \ of Beach and Mitchell (1978) that an \nindividual, during the decision-making\
    \ process, acts subjectively and not \nobjectively. \nTo measure the perceived\
    \ usefulness and ease of use of information technologies, \nDavis (1989) developed\
    \ and tested a specific scale with various assumptions. The \n!22\ninitial scale\
    \ had 14 items for each component. The analyzed results of the first \nstudy showed\
    \ that only 6 items were relevant. The second study confirmed the \nresults. According\
    \ to those results, usefulness correlated with the usage of \ntechnology and could\
    \ be described with the following terms: “work more quickly”, \n“job performance”,\
    \ “increase productivity”, “effectiveness”, “makes job easier”, \n“useful”. In\
    \ the case of the ease of use, the following terms correlated with the \nusage\
    \ of technology: “easy to learn”, “controllable”, “clear and understandable”,\
    \ \n“flexible”, “easy to become skillful ”, “easy to use”. \nSince the publication\
    \ of the TAM, it has become a robust model that can explain \nup to 40% of the\
    \ variance in the data (Venkatesh and Davis, 2000). Nevertheless, \nVenkatesh\
    \ and Davis (2000) extended the model and enhanced its construct by \nadding more\
    \ determinants. According to the improved model, the following \ncomponents influence\
    \ perceived usefulness: experience, subjective norm, image, \njob relevance, output\
    \ quality, result demonstrability and voluntariness. These new \ndeterminants\
    \ were divided into two larger groups: social influence and cognitive \nprocess.\
    \ \nSubjective norm, voluntariness and image were part of the social influence\
    \ \nprocess. Subjective norm and voluntariness were both part of a person’s \n\
    perception of what the social factors in their respective culture expect an individual\
    \ \nto do. In the case of subjective norm, the decision to adopt takes place under\
    \ \nmandatory conditions; in the case of voluntariness, this decision is determined\
    \ by \nnon-mandatory conditions. Image is defined as the social status of an individual\
    \ \nthat can be improved in case they choose to use the innovation. \nThe cognitive\
    \ group of determinants includes job relevance, output quality, result \ndemonstrability\
    \ and perceived ease of use. Job relevance is defined as the degree \nof relevance\
    \ of an innovation for the fulfillment of certain job tasks. The output \nquality\
    \ is an individual’s perception of the quality of the task achieved with the use\
    \ \nof the innovation. To be able to estimate the quality of the task, the results\
    \ should \nbe visible to the individual. That is how result demonstrability is\
    \ defined. To test the \nmodel, Venkatesh and Davis (2000) conducted four empirical\
    \ studies with different \n!23\ncompanies and different research objectives. The\
    \ results of those studies \nconfirmed the robustness of the model, as new determinants\
    \ helped explain up to \n60% of the variance for intention to use an innovation.\
    \ The following graph \nvisualizes the constellation of factor dependencies on\
    \ the decision to adopt new \ntechnology. \nFigure 8: Enhanced TAM (based on Venkatesh\
    \ and Davis, 2000) \nTAM and its extended versions were actively used in the field\
    \ of agriculture to \npredict the adoption of information and communication technology\
    \ (ICT), e.g. ICT \nuse by the Agricultural Extension agents in West Azerbaijan.\
    \ There, the original \nmodel was enhanced by adding two additional determinants,\
    \ experience and the \ncompany’s willingness to fund, which influence the cognitive\
    \ process. This \nenhanced model could explain 64% of behavior changes (Alambaigi\
    \ and Ahangari, \n2015). Far and Rezaei-Moghaddam (2017) investigated the acceptance\
    \ of \nprecision farming technology by Iranian agricultural consultants by using\
    \ the \nenhanced TAM. In this study, additional determinants such as confidence\
    \ and \npersonal innovativeness were used to predict the decision of using the\
    \ technology. \nThe results of the study could explain 56% of the variance in\
    \ behavioral change. \n3.1.4 Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of the Technology\
    \ \nThe fourth model is the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of the Technology\
    \ \n!24\n(UTAUT). This model was developed based on all models described above\
    \ and \nseveral other extensions thereof. Venkatesh et al. (2003), in their literature\
    \ review \nof technology acceptance models, criticized the results obtained by\
    \ the TAM \nstudies because almost all studies were conducted with students. The\
    \ \nmeasurements took place after acceptance or rejection of the technology and\
    \ not \nduring the process of the decision-making. The context and the nature\
    \ of the \nmeasurements were also criticized by the authors. They conducted a\
    \ longitudinal \nstudy, where they used several scales to measure the acceptance\
    \ of technology \nincluding the one suggested by Davis (1989). The results of\
    \ this study helped \ndetermine factors that impact the user’s acceptance and\
    \ adoption behavior: \nperformance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence,\
    \ and facilitating \nconditions (Venkatesh et al., 2003, p.447). \nPerformance\
    \ expectancy was defined as “the degree to which an individual \nbelieves that\
    \ using the system will help him or her to attain gains in job \nperformance”\
    \ (Venkatesh et al., 2003, p.447 ). Effort expectancy is the perceived \neasiness\
    \ of the technology’s use. Social influence describes the level of \nperception\
    \ of a person regarding how their use of an innovation will be viewed \nwithin\
    \ society or by specific important individuals. Facilitating conditions represent\
    \ \ntechnical and organizational conditions that make the use of innovation possible\
    \ \nand/or easier. \nAfter these four important factors were defined, the authors\
    \ measured whether \nthese factors have different effects depending on the following\
    \ determinants: \ngender, age, experience and voluntariness to use. According\
    \ to the results \nobtained, performance expectancy and social influence were\
    \ important for the \ninnovation acceptance independent of those determinants.\
    \ Effort expectancy is \nmore significant for women and elderly people. Facilitating\
    \ conditions are \nsignificant only in the case of older workers. The model of\
    \ the decision-making \nprocess based on the UTAUT is shown below. \n!25\nFigure\
    \ 9: Factors influencing the decision to adopt according to UTAUT (based on \n\
    Venkatesh et al., 2003) \nThis model, in combination with the theory about the\
    \ Diffusion of Innovation, was \nused to explain the use of ICT by Malaysian farmers\
    \ (Mahamood et al., 2016). The \ncombined model could explain 10.2% of the variance.\
    \ As a result, the authors \nsuggested further adjustment of the model. Another\
    \ study in the area of ICT, \nconducted among agricultural extension officers\
    \ in Kenya, could explain 56% of \nthe variance (Kahenya et al., 2014). The model\
    \ helped find a strong correlation \nbetween improved productivity, facilitating\
    \ conditions and management support \nthat influenced the use of ICT. However,\
    \ the authors also suggest improving this \nmodel for further studies. \nThe theories\
    \ presented above have certain determinants that were partly used in \nother models.\
    \ However, neither of the models can explain 100% of the variance; \neven their\
    \ combinations, as in the case of UTAUT, do not necessarily provide \nbetter results.\
    \ In Table 2 below, the factors mentioned by the different theories \nwere grouped\
    \ according to technological, psychological and communication \naspects that play\
    \ an important role in the decision-making process regarding \ninnovation adoption.\

    \ aspects that influence the \ndecision to adopt \nAccording to Table 2, from\
    \ the technological perspective, two aspects were \nmentioned in three out of\
    \ four theories: usefulness and ease of use. From the \npsychological aspect,\
    \ subjective norms or social influence were also important \nfactors that influenced\
    \ the decision-to-adopt, according to three out of four \ntheories. Communication\
    \ aspects were mentioned only in the theory on the \nDiffusion of Innovation.\
    \ However, those aspects relate to psychological aspects \nsuch as social influence,\
    \ communicated through either mass media or \ninterpersonal channels; these also\
    \ have an influence on the decision to adopt. \nWhen the main factors regarding\
    \ the decision to adopt have been identified, it is \nimportant to quantify the\
    \ critical mass and to understand how many users need to \npositively decide to\
    \ use new technology so that critical mass can be achieved. \nAlso, it must be\
    \ discovered whether there are additional factors that should be \nconsidered\
    \ in each special case. \n3.2 Definition of critical mass and the market barriers\
    \ on the way to its \nachievement \n3.2.1 Definition and measurement of critical\
    \ mass \nCritical mass became a popular phenomenon in several fields of study,\
    \ ranging \nfrom sociology to economics. In 1978, in the field of sociology, Granovetter\
    \ \ndescribed a threshold model, wherein a threshold is “the number or proportion\
    \ of \nothers who must make one decision before a given actor does so” (Granovetter,\
    \ \n1978, p.1420). The concept of a threshold was the basis for the definition\
    \ of critical \nEase of use (DOI, TAM, \nUTAUT)\nIntention (TPB/ UTAUT)\nInterpersonal\

    \ aspects\nPsychological aspects\nCommunication aspects\n!27\nmass in the theory\
    \ about the diffusion of innovations. Later, Rogers defined critical \nmass as\
    \ “the minimal number of adopters of an interactive innovation for the \nfurther\
    \ rate of adoption to be self-sustaining” (Rogers, 1983, p.720). To explain the\
    \ \nminimal number of adopters, Rogers (1983) divided consumers into different\
    \ types \nof adopters due to their threshold level in the decision-making process.\
    \ He also \ncreated a sequence of each group of adopters that influence the following\
    \ group to \nparticipate in the process of adoption. Rogers (1983) identified\
    \ five groups of \nadopters that adopt innovation in the following sequence: 1)\
    \ innovators, 2) early \nadopters, 3) early majority, 4) late majority and 5)\
    \ laggards. Each of these groups \nhas certain characteristics that unite the\
    \ consumers in them.  \nThe first group of adopters, innovators, are well-informed\
    \ consumers who use a \nwide range of information sources. They are not dependent\
    \ on the subjective \nnorms, since they are the first who try new things. They\
    \ are better equipped to \nadopt complex products and also have substantial financial\
    \ resources for their \ntrial-and-error process. “The innovator plays a gate-keeping\
    \ role in the flow of new \nideas into a social system” (Rogers, 1983, p.248).\
    \ \nThe next group are early adopters, who are more strongly integrated into the\
    \ \nsocial system and act as opinion leaders. Rogers refers to such an individual\
    \ as \n“an individual to check with before using a new idea” (Rogers, 1983, p.249).\
    \ This is \na decisive group for the success of innovation diffusion, because\
    \ this group of \npotential users is eager to try new products and services on\
    \ the market and ready \nto invest their time and money in them. Social prestige,\
    \ the wish to become a \ntrend-setter and the wish to preserve the esteem of others\
    \ are their motivational \nfactors. Malcolm Gladwell (2001), in his book about\
    \ the tipping point calls early \nadopters “visionaries”. They are ready to take\
    \ risks and then present their \nconclusions about the new technology to their\
    \ peers. Normally, early adopters \nhave a higher social status and better education.\
    \ Some of them even use a new \ntechnology to achieve a higher social status.\
    \ In terms of agriculture, Rogers (1983) \ndescribes several studies that showed\
    \ that farmers with larger units adopt new \ntechnologies more often and earlier\
    \ than the rest of the market. Early adopters are \nalso extremely well connected.\
    \ Rogers (1983) describes their role in the process \n!28\nof the diffusion of\
    \ innovation as minimizing uncertainty about new innovations. \nEarly adopters\
    \ represent a bridge between innovators and the early majority. The \nearly majority\
    \ in return provides an interconnectedness in the system between \npeople with\
    \ high and low acceptance / threshold of the technology. \nThe early majority\
    \ follows the leaders and requires some time to adjust to new \ntechnology, having\
    \ lower adoption skills or resources. The late majority adopts \neither because\
    \ of a new social norm or because they have recognized the \nusefulness of new\
    \ technology. The behavioral control of these individuals differs in \ncomparison\
    \ with the early adopters or the early majority: they are aware of their \nscarce\
    \ resources and avoid uncertainties when they are making such a decision.  \n\
    The last group in the diffusion process are the laggards, who are conservative\
    \ \nindividuals with high resistance to new technologies. They are very cautious\
    \ about \nnew technology and, normally, they adopt them only when the use of previous\
    \ \ntechnologies has become impossible or more complex than the new ones. \nFigure\

    \ there are 2.5% of innovators, 13.5% of the early \nadopters, 34% of the early\
    \ majority, 34% of the late majority and 16% of laggards \non the market (Rogers,\
    \ 1989, p.247). Critical mass occurs when 10 to 20% of \nadoption is reached.\
    \ This appears in the segment between early adopters and the \n!29\nearly majority\
    \ on the market. For the purpose of this research, critical mass will be \ndefined\
    \ as a threshold that should be higher than 10% of the market share.  \nThe process\
    \ of achieving critical mass for startups is not a straightforward one, \nsince\
    \ time and market chasms can build a barrier that is hard to predict. \n3.2.2\
    \ Chasm as an obstacle on the way to critical mass \nIn 2015, the Focus Group\
    \ on “Mainstreaming Precision Farming”, created by the \nEuropean Innovation Partnership\
    \ “Agricultural Productivity and \nSustainability” (EIP-AGRI), have admitted that\
    \ the adoption of a precision farming \nsystem is currently lagging. 19 experts\
    \ from the focus group came to the \nconclusion that “risk, the initial investment\
    \ required and insufficient knowledge \nappear to be the main reasons why farmers\
    \ do not switch to precision \nfarming” (EIP-AGRI, 2015, p.7). \nMoore (1999)\
    \ explains that the phenomenon of non-adoption appears when the \nearly majority\
    \ has a much higher threshold for innovation acceptance than early \nadopters:\
    \ “Being the first, they [early adopters] also are prepared to bear with the \n\
    inevitable bugs and glitches that accompany any innovation just coming to market.\
    \ \nBy contrast, the early majority want to buy a productivity improvement for\
    \ existing \noperations. They are looking to minimize the discontinuity with the\
    \ old ways. They \nwant evolution, not revolution” (Moore, 1999, p.15). This means\
    \ that critical mass \ncannot be achieved if the differences between intentions\
    \ and abilities of the early \nadopters are drastically different in comparison\
    \ to the early majority. \nAccording to von Jeinsen et al. (2018), who categorized\
    \ the results of a number of \nstudies, the difference between early adopters\
    \ and the early majority regarding \ninnovation acceptance in the field of agriculture\
    \ can be attributed to age, \nexperience, gender and educational level. A number\
    \ of studies revealed that \nyounger farmers with experience and a higher educational\
    \ level, were more \nadvanced adopters of new technologies in comparison to their\
    \ peers (Aguilar-\nGallegos et al., 2015; Cavallo et al., 2014). The problem of\
    \ aging is one of the \nimportant issues on the agricultural market. According\
    \ to the report of the FAO \n(2014), the average age of farmers in the United\
    \ States and other developed \n!30\ncountries is approximately 60 years. In Africa,\
    \ where most of the population is \nunder 24, a farmer’s average age is also around\
    \ 60 years. The main difference \nbetween young and elderly people concerning\
    \ technology use is that for the \nyounger farmers, the use of smartphones and\
    \ tablets is something that they know \nvery well from their private lives, whereas\
    \ elderly farmers must often learn to use \nthese technologies before they are\
    \ able to add them to their work processes.  \nAnother important determinant was\
    \ the size of a farm and, connected with this, the \nlevel of income. The more\
    \ resources a farm has, the more innovative it is (von \nJeinsen et al., 2018).\
    \ To better understand one of the possible reasons that could \ncause the chasm\
    \ on the market, it is necessary to define the early adopters and \nearly majority.\
    \ Starting in the year 2000, there were a number of studies that \nlooked at the\
    \ acceptance of information and communication technologies (ICT) \namong farmers\
    \ in developed countries.  \nIn the research presented here, at first only the\
    \ European market will be \nconsidered for a comparative analysis of the characteristics\
    \ of early adopters and \nthe early majority. To find relevant studies on ICT\
    \ adoption, the following scientific \ndatabases were used: Google Scholar, science\
    \ direct, Jstore, Econis, AgEcon. \nThe following keywords were used to select\
    \ the studies: “technology adoption”, \n“ICT”, “IT”, “agriculture”, “farmers”,\
    \ “precision farming”, “smartphone use”, \n“technology diffusion”, “Europe”. As\
    \ a result, nine studies were identified that are \npresented in Table 3 below.\
    \ \nAccording to the results of the studies presented below, age and the size\
    \ of the \nfarms play an important role in the adoption of a new technology. Farmers\
    \ who \nwere younger then 45 years were mentioned as technology-savvy users in\
    \ the \nstudies. If the share of young farmers on the market is small, and they\
    \ represent \nless than 10% of the market, this could be a possible reason for\
    \ the existence of \nthe chasm. However, what was more important than age was\
    \ IT literacy and the \ngeneral educational level. If the market share of farmers\
    \ who have knowledge and \nexperience with technology for on-farm processes is\
    \ also small, then this could \ncause the chasm as well. Another important group\
    \ of early adopters were large \n!31\nfarms that own more than 250 ha. Here, the\
    \ difference to small and medium-sized \nfarms could primarily be the size of\
    \ the budget that they can spend on technology, \nas well as their previous experience\
    \ with innovations. \n*The study did not find a definite connection between age\
    \ or farm size. However, the participants of \nthe survey had a field size of\
    \ 500 ha, which is larger than the average field size in the UK. 57% of \nthe\
    \ survey participants were between 46 and 55 years old \nTable 3: Characteristics\
    \ of early adopters and early majority of ICT in agriculture \nIn addition to\
    \ the demographic and social aspects of the early adopters and early \nmajority,\
    \ Ram and Sheth (1989) identified two further reasons for potential \ncustomer\
    \ resistance to innovations: functional and psychological. Functional \nbarriers\
    \ can be product usage, value and risks. A usage barrier appears when the \ninnovation\
    \ is not compatible with existing practices, habits and routines. The value \n\
    of the innovation is defined by its level of usefulness and price performance\
    \ ratio. \nCharacteristics of ICT \nearly adopters\nCharacteristics of ICT \n\

    !32\nThe last technological barrier is risk, which is directly connected with\
    \ the level of \nuncertainty and perceived side effects that might appear after\
    \ starting to \nimplement an innovation. There are four different types of risks\
    \ connected to \ninnovation: physical, economic, functional and social (Ram and\
    \ Sheth, 1989). \nAccording to EIP-AGRI (2015), in Europe, new agricultural information\
    \ \ntechnologies are connected more closely with functional risks, meaning users\
    \ are \nnot sure about the performance of the technology and economic risks if\
    \ a certain \namount of investment is needed. \nPsychological barriers include\
    \ cultural and traditional as well as image barriers. \nCultural and traditional\
    \ barriers change very slowly and are connected with the \nsocial acceptability\
    \ of certain innovations. Image barriers represent the \nconsumer’s associations\
    \ with the innovation or its producers. If a manufacturer \nthat has an otherwise\
    \ bad reputation launches a potentially useful innovation, it \ncould be met with\
    \ resistance by potential customers. \nSome functional and psychological barriers\
    \ on the way to adoption could be \nexplained by the immaturity of the technology.\
    \ This means that startups sometimes \nbring technologies to the market that cannot\
    \ be employed immediately for various \nreasons, e.g. lack of suitable infrastructure,\
    \ legislation or the weakness of the \ntechnology itself. \n3.2.3 Technology maturity\
    \ and its impact on critical mass  \nThe topic of technology maturity measurement\
    \ is almost as old as the diffusion of \ninnovation itself. The maturity of the\
    \ technology is a basis for the achievement of \ncritical mass. Albert (2015)\
    \ delineated four types of existing systems for \ntechnology maturity measurements:\
    \ theoretical, semi-theoretical, semi-\noperationalized and operationalized. \
    \ \nTheoretical models suggest ambiguous methods for the measurement of \ntechnology\
    \ development without specific measurable indicators. As an example, \nAlbert\
    \ (2015) suggests Gartner’s Hype Cycle model. This model was developed in \n!33\n\
    1995 by an American research and advisory company, Gartner, and explains the \n\
    spread of hype through the media and its importance for technology adoption. \n\
    Media hype in this sense could be described as a process where “an (unusual) \n\
    event triggers increased media attention; the media set their focus on this specific\
    \ \ntopic or event; they enlarge it, and by so doing evoke all kinds of social\
    \ responses, \nwhich will in turn become news as well, further stimulating the\
    \ news \nwave” (Vasterman, 2005). Mass media sometimes embraces new technology\
    \ and \ndescribes it as a break-through too early. This information gives hope\
    \ and spurs \nthe creation of new ventures using this technology. However, oftentimes\
    \ such new \nventures fail without achieving proof of concept because the costs\
    \ of the \ntechnology are high, and the benefits are not clear. Later, disillusion\
    \ displaces the \nhype (Linden and Fenn, 2003). \nThe problem with hype is that\
    \ the media describes an innovation as more mature \nthan it really is. At the\
    \ same time, experience and knowledge that was gathered in \ntimes of hype helps\
    \ to create new improved generations of the technology, which \ncreates a basis\
    \ for mainstream adoption. An important question for any innovative \ncompany\
    \ is: How to understand when there is hype on the market and when the \ntechnology\
    \ is mature enough to be implemented? According to the report by \nLinden and\
    \ Fenn (2003), hype starts at an early stage of technological \ndevelopment, and\
    \ its peak is achieved when, on the market, there is almost no \nadoption at first\
    \ because the technology’s performance is poor. When the hype \nends, usually\
    \ there are already new generations of the technology on the market. \nThe ecosystem\
    \ for this technology starts to evolve and, with it, adoption starts to \nincrease.\
    \ The maturity of technology starts when more than 30% of potential \ncustomers\
    \ have adopted the technology. For better understanding the graph below \nshows\
    \ the Gartner Hype Circle combined with the Rogers adoption curve (Figure \n11).\
    \ \n \n!34\nFigure 11: Gartner Hype Cycle (adopted from Linden and Fenn, 2003)\
    \ and Adoption \nCurve (adopted from Rogers, 1983)  \nBased on the Gartner Hype\
    \ Cycle, Monsanto has developed their own vision of \nthe current maturity state\
    \ for existing agricultural innovations (Jarolímek et al., \n2017, p.70). In the\
    \ following paragraphs, along with the description of each phase \nof the Gartner\
    \ Hype Cycle, the maturity level of these agricultural innovations will \nbe mentioned.\
    \ \nThe first phase of an innovation trigger starts with the first press releases\
    \ and \ntechnology demonstrations, which attract even more attention to it. However,\
    \ there \nis no usable product at the time. Then, an “on the rise” stage occurs,\
    \ which stands \nbetween the trigger and peak of the hype. During this stage,\
    \ there are many \nexplanatory and discussion articles about the technology; first,\
    \ highly specialized \nproducts or extremely hard-to-use products appear on the\
    \ market. Regarding \nagriculture, according to the Monsanto corporation, such\
    \ technologies as indoor \nfarming, on-plant sensors and in-field wireless are\
    \ still on the rise (Jarolímek et al., \n2017, p.70). For the products at this\
    \ stage, the prices are normally very high, as \nthe developers hope to regain\
    \ their investment. Alternatively, they are just too \ncomplex and cannot really\
    \ offer a relative advantage.  \n!35\nAt the “peak of hype” stage, the number\
    \ of startups increases, and they try to use \nthe hype for their marketing purposes\
    \ and to obtain investment. However, at this \nstage, the technology is still\
    \ not suitable for use even by early adopters. Since \nthere are more new products\
    \ that are not mature enough, the first negative press \narticles appear. Less\
    \ interest from the media leads to disillusionment, which \ncharacterizes the\
    \ stage of “the Trough of Disillusionment”. Currently, in the eyes of \nMonsanto,\
    \ aerial imagery and big data in the field of agriculture are currently in the\
    \ \ndisillusionment phase (Jarolímek et al., 2017, p.70). At the following stage,\
    \ “Slope \nof Enlightenment”, more companies appear that offer improved versions\
    \ of the \ntechnology. They are more willing to experiment and to test their solutions.\
    \ Early \nadopters start actively using the innovation. At the beginning of this\
    \ stage, the \nproduct penetration is less than 5%. In the end, it ends up taking\
    \ 30% of the \nmarket. In this phase, according to Monsanto, farm management systems\
    \ and \nsatellite imagery can be taken as examples (Jarolímek et al., 2017, p.70).\
    \  \n“The Plateau of Productivity” is the beginning of the introduction of the\
    \ product to \nthe mainstream market, where the technology starts to be integrated\
    \ into other \nproducts; services around this technology appear. Yield monitors,\
    \ soil sampling, in-\ncab displays and auto-steer are close to becoming mainstream\
    \ products and could \nbe applied by the majority of farmers, according to Monsanto’s\
    \ estimates \n(Jarolímek et al., 2017, p.70). Consistent with this theoretical\
    \ model, critical mass \ncould be achieved when an innovation is at the stage\
    \ of the “Slope of \nEnlightenment”. \nSemi-theoretical models, in contrast to\
    \ the theoretical ones, provide other \nfeasible factors that could be measured.\
    \ However, these factors do not always \nhave measurable indicators, which reduces\
    \ their applicability. As an example of \nsuch measurement systems, Albert (2015)\
    \ presented a model of Sommerlatte and \nDeschamps (1986), which describes the\
    \ different stages of technology \ndevelopment. The model was selected by Albert\
    \ (2015) because of its popularity \nand good description of technology maturity\
    \ stages. Sommerlatte and Deschamps \n(1986) divided technology development processes\
    \ into four stages: emergence, \ngrowth, saturation and decline. To be able to\
    \ define a current state of a technology, \n!36\nthe authors suggest following\
    \ indicators: insecurity of technological performance, \nlevel of investment in\
    \ the technology, number of technology applications, type of \ndevelopment requirements,\
    \ impact on cost or performance of products, number \nand type of patents, access\
    \ requirements, and availability of technology \n(Sommerlatte and Deschamps, 1986).\
    \  \nFor example, during the growth phase of innovation technological performance\
    \ is \nmoderate; the level of investment is maximal; the number of cases of technology\
    \ \nuse increases; the development of innovation is aimed at the creation of new\
    \ use \ncases; the impact on cost or performance is maximal; the number of patents\
    \ is \nhigh; and most of them are product-oriented; the access to a product is\
    \ given to \nthe personnel of a company who then act as early adopters; and its\
    \ availability is \namplifying (Albert, 2015). Sommerlatte and Deschamps (1986)\
    \ also use an \nincreasing number of case studies as an indicator for the growth\
    \ stage. \nAs examples of semi-operationalized models, Albert (2015) indicates\
    \ the S-\ncurve, which was used by Foster (1986), the Technology Readiness Level\
    \ (TRL), \nas suggested in the NASA White Paper by Mankins (1995), and patent-based\
    \ \nmodels.  \nFoster (1986) suggested a measurement of technological maturity\
    \ according to its \nreturns on investment that resemble the S-curve Pattern of\
    \ Innovation. In the very \nbeginning of a technology’s development, there is\
    \ either low or no return on \ninvestment. With further development of the technology,\
    \ the occurrence of a large \npositive difference between previous and current\
    \ periods could be a sign of \ntechnological maturity in terms of return on investment.\
    \ When the return on \ninvestment starts to stagnate or even decline, it is a\
    \ sign that the current \ntechnology already has achieved its full potential.\
    \  \nThe TRL method was suggested as a method for estimation of the readiness\
    \ of \nspace technology. This method has nine stages that could be divided into\
    \ four \ngroups: ideation, development, prototype testing and testing in the real\
    \ context. \nWhen the prototype is successfully tested in a real context, this\
    \ is an indicator for \nthe maturity of the technology.  \n!37\nThe third instrument\
    \ of semi-operationalized technology maturity measurement \nAlbert mentions is\
    \ the consideration of the number of patents and/or number of \nlicenses and/or\
    \ royalties. Basberg (1987) argues in favor of patent measurement \nbecause patent\
    \ statistics are available and provide data that allow making cross-\nindustrial\
    \ and cross-national comparisons and to observe the diffusion of \ninnovation\
    \ among countries. Haupt et al. (2007) are in favor of this method \nbecause obtaining\
    \ patents gives companies an opportunity to commercialize the \npatented invention.\
    \ According to the results of their study, for one particular \ntechnology, the\
    \ number of literature citations and citations of other patents in the \nsame\
    \ technological field increases significantly during the transitional phase from\
    \ \ntechnology emergence to its growth phase. Also, the time taken/needed to \n\
    examine a new patent is shorter during the growth period in comparison to the\
    \ \nintroduction and maturity period (Haupt et al., 2007).  \nThe last type of\
    \ technology maturity measurement method consists of \noperationalized models\
    \ that, according to Albert (2015), are very rare. One such \nmodel is suggested\
    \ by Watts and Porter (1997). The core method of this model is \nmonitoring bibliographic\
    \ sources about a certain technology to find out “who is \ndoing what now?”. One\
    \ of the ways is to look at a specific scientific database and \nmonitor hits\
    \ or ratings of articles about this technology. For this purpose, special \nkeywords\
    \ about the technology are usually selected. Searching these keywords in \nthe\
    \ abstracts of scientific articles should give an impression about the direction\
    \ of \nresearch in this area and the number of articles written about it. To observe\
    \ \ntechnology development, it is necessary to monitor the number of articles\
    \ that \nappear in the fundamental research, in the applied research, and in the\
    \ evidence \nor impact measurement research. When the technology is in its early\
    \ stages, the \nnumber of articles will be the highest in the fundamental research\
    \ area. Then, with \nthe development of the technology, this number will decline,\
    \ and the number of \nresearch articles about the technology’s application will\
    \ increase.  \nThis approach was amplified in the concept of the Technology Life\
    \ Cycle (TLC). \nThis system takes into consideration several sources of information,\
    \ e.g. science \ncitation indexes, engineering indexes, patent information and\
    \ newspapers, which \n!38\ncan help estimate the social impact of an innovation.\
    \ The most important aspect of \nthe TLC model is that the increasing number of\
    \ mentions of the technology in \nvarious sources should be sequential. This means\
    \ that first mentions of a new \ntechnology should be found in scientific literature,\
    \ then in the literature regarding \napplication (engineering), then in patent\
    \ information sources and only then in the \npress.  \nOne of the criticisms of\
    \ the bibliographic method is that often, in technological \nforecasting, only\
    \ one database is used and not several at the same time. Such a \nselection can\
    \ lead to a biased perspective on technological development \n(Järvenpää et al.,\
    \ 2011). The first two sources of information – science and \nengineering research\
    \ – are usually obtained from the two largest databases (such \nas the Science\
    \ Citation Index and Compendex), and other sources of information \nare not considered.\
    \ Using patent information could also, in some technological \ncases, be disadvantageous,\
    \ because some technologies that appear on the \nmarket are not patentable (like\
    \ open-source technologies, for example), and some \ntechnologies that were patented\
    \ were never commercialized. Järvenpää et al. \n(2011) selected three different\
    \ technologies and tested the TLC model; only the \ndevelopment of one technology\
    \ followed the sequential order of the TLC model. \nSince there is no perfect\
    \ model that can help detect the exact stage of innovation \ndevelopment, this\
    \ could be an interesting topic for further research. For the \npurposes of the\
    \ research presented here, the results of the hype cycle developed \nby Monsanto\
    \ will be taken into consideration, and agricultural technologies that are \n\
    in the phase of the “Slope of Enlightenment” or further will be selected for the\
    \ \nqualitative investigation, because these are the phases where critical mass\
    \ takes \nplace (see Figure 11) . \nTo gain a better understanding of the current\
    \ situation on the agricultural market, \nthe following questions must be asked:\
    \ What kinds of barriers do startups see on \nthe way to achievement of critical\
    \ mass? What kinds of strategies do they use to \ngrow and to gain the acceptance\
    \ of farmers? To provide suitable answers, a \nqualitative investigation shall\
    \ first be conducted.\P\n!39\n4 Explorative study of the market perception and\
    \ current \nmarketing strategies of agricultural startups \nCurrently there are\
    \ several challenges for growth due to the demographical and \nsocial changes\
    \ on the agricultural market, as delineated in the previous chapter. \nTo understand\
    \ which strategies can support startups in overcoming these \nchallenges that\
    \ eventually cause chasms on the market, and help them achieve \ncritical mass,\
    \ it is necessary to look at the current strategies that startups use. It is \n\
    also becoming necessary to select the most promising ones. To do so, the existing\
    \ \nstartup strategies used in developed and developing countries will be explored.\
    \ \nThe exploration of these strategies will be conducted with the use of the\
    \ qualitative \nmethod. \n4.1 The qualitative method and its role in agricultural\
    \ research \nQualitative research could be described as “any type of research\
    \ that produces \nfindings not arrived at by statistical procedures or other means\
    \ of \nquantification” (Strauss and Corbin, 1998, pp.10-11). Although agricultural\
    \ \neconomics is a part of social science, in contrast to other social sciences\
    \ such as \ncommunication, ethnology or sociology, the use of the qualitative\
    \ method is \nrelatively rare, except in studies regarding agricultural economics\
    \ in developing \ncountries (Bitsch, 2000). In 1950, the percentage of studies\
    \ using quantitative \nmethods was, as mentioned in the “American Journal of Agricultural\
    \ Economics”, \nonly 5%. It rose to 92% in 1992 (Bitsch, 2001). Nonetheless, the\
    \ qualitative \nmethod is usually a part of any research where the research subject\
    \ is abstract or \ncomplex. A complex subject, such as technology adoption or\
    \ crossing the chasm, \nbecame popular within agricultural research and, as a\
    \ result, a number of studies \nthat used qualitative methods were published (Sattar\
    \ et al., 2017). \nTechnology adoption research includes several complex topics,\
    \ such as farmers’ \nbehavior and perceptions, socio-economic factors, communication\
    \ ( the spread of \ninformation), psychological factors, and institutional aspects.\
    \ The scientific \napproach for research on complex subjects is defined by the\
    \ choice of the \nresearch method. In the introduction, it was already mentioned\
    \ that, for the \n!40\nresearch presented here, a post-positivism paradigm was\
    \ selected. Therefore, the \nfindings of this research might not be directly generalized\
    \ because post-positivism \nrecognizes the uniqueness of situations or culture,\
    \ but they could be transferable \nto other contexts (O’Leary, 2004). \nThe contribution\
    \ of qualitative research consists of providing answers to open-end \nquestions\
    \ like “why” and “how” (Ritchie and Lewis, 2003). In this case, the present \n\
    analysis seeks insight into how digital agricultural startups manage to grow on\
    \ the \nagricultural market. To reach this objective, the method selected was\
    \ that of the in-\ndepth interview. \n4.1.1 Role of the in-depth interview in\
    \ the investigation process \nAn interview could be defined as a process where\
    \ the knowledge emerges through \nthe collaboration between interviewee and researcher\
    \ (Holstein and Gubrium, \n1997). Qualitative methodology demands that the researcher\
    \ be a good listener \nand have a flexible and clear mind to be able to react\
    \ quickly to conversational \ndevelopments (Legard et al., 2003). Usually, in-depth\
    \ interviews include a small \nnumber of respondents to investigate their perspective\
    \ on a certain topic (Boyce \nand Neale, 2006). In-depth interviews are, most\
    \ of the time, semi-structured, \ncontaining guidelines that support flexibility\
    \ during the interview. If the \ninterviewee’s answer spontaneously raises an\
    \ issue or topic not previously \nincluded in the interview guide, then it is\
    \ still possible to explore this topic. \nAccording to Stokes and Bergin (2006)\
    \ there are several advantages of the in-\ndepth interview: \n1) An in-depth interview\
    \ is more detailed than surveys; \n2) In-depth interviews provide comprehensiveness\
    \ of information. The researcher \nhas an opportunity to obtain necessary information\
    \ using two approaches: \nexploration or explanation. Often, certain answers could\
    \ be superficial or \nlacking logical sequence. In that case, there is an opportunity\
    \ to clarify the \ninformation via follow-up questions. \n3) The researcher has\
    \ an opportunity to observe the emotions and reactions of \nthe interviewee during\
    \ the interview, which could confirm or disprove certain \n!41\nassumptions. \n\
    The advantages of this method help achieve the aim of this study, i.e. to \ninvestigate\
    \ a startup’s approach to growth and gain a better insight into how the \ndigital\
    \ agricultural market works. The unstructured survey provides an opportunity \n\
    to diverge a number of possible strategies to cross the chasm (the gap between\
    \ \nearly adopters and early majority), which will later be converged to a number\
    \ of \nstrategies for establishing a concrete hypothesis. \nIn choosing the number\
    \ of the in-depth interviews needed to represent an overall \npicture of the phenomenon,\
    \ the data saturation method will be used. Data \nsaturation could be comparable\
    \ to sample significance in the quantitative method. \nData saturation is a point\
    \ during the analysis of the data where, with each new \ninterview conducted with\
    \ the same target group, no new information or themes are \ndisclosed (Bowen,\
    \ 2008). When data saturation is achieved, it can be assumed \nthat the existing\
    \ sample is substantial enough to detect certain patterns. \n4.1.2 Triangulation\
    \ as a verification method for qualitative data \nTo verify the results from the\
    \ in-depth interviews and to be able to elaborate a \ntheoretical framework, a\
    \ data triangulation method will be used. “Triangulation \nmeans looking at the\
    \ same phenomenon, or research question, from more than \none source of data”\
    \ (Decrop, 1999, p.158). Data triangulation, on the one hand, \nhelps one understand\
    \ whether the findings contradict or support the existing \nresults of previous\
    \ studies (Miles and Huberman, 1984). On the other hand, data \ntriangulation\
    \ helps to discover additional topical insights that were found in other \nstudies\
    \ or theories. This helps to amplify the understanding of the phenomena and \n\
    the design of further research. \nAccording to the scientific literature, it is\
    \ possible to identify four different types of \ntriangulation: „Triangulation\
    \ of data combines data drawn from different sources \nand different times, in\
    \ different places from different people“ (Flick, 2004, p.178). \nThere are two\
    \ methods of performing data triangulation: 1) the use of secondary \n!42\ndata\
    \ (photographs, articles, statistical data, films, etc.) beyond the primary \n\
    material, such as interviews or observations; 2) field notes that are taken \n\
    immediately after observation or interview, for example (Decrop, 1999). Data \n\
    triangulation is helpful to understand, for one, if the research subject behaves\
    \ the \nsame in the different situations, in different places or at a different\
    \ time of day.  \nTriangulation of theories is defined as „approaching data with\
    \ multiple perspectives \nand hypotheses in mind… Various theoretical points of\
    \ view could be placed side \nby side to assess their utility and power“ (Denzin,\
    \ 2009, p.303).  \nMethod triangulation consists of using a combination of methods\
    \ for researching \nthe same object. It could be a combination of the quantitative\
    \ and the qualitative \nmethods, but not in hierarchical way. Such an approach\
    \ can help reduce the \nbiases and limits of each method (Decrop, 1999).  \nThe\
    \ fourth type of triangulation is investigator triangulation, which “is characterized\
    \ \nby the use of different observers or interviewers, to balance out subjective\
    \ \ninfluences of individuals“ (Flick, 2004, p.178). \n4.2 Data collection and\
    \ analysis of the in-depth interviews \nThe following criteria were applied to\
    \ select digital agricultural startups for the in-\ndepth interviews: 1) the startup's\
    \ website is online and its product or working \nprototype is ready to be tested\
    \ or is already being used; 2) the product or solution \nhas been built based\
    \ on information technology; 3) the product or a solution is \nscalable; 4) farmers\
    \ are the target group of the startup. To find such startups, the \ntwo largest\
    \ platforms that provide information about startups worldwide were used: \nf6s\
    \ and AngelList. In addition to these two platforms, contacts to startups obtained\
    \ \nduring the Agritechnica fair in Hannover in 2015 and the GIL (full name of\
    \ the \ninitiator of the conference in German “Gesellschaft für Informatik in\
    \ der Land-, \nForst- und Ernährungswirtschaft e.V.”) conference in 2016 were\
    \ used. All in all, 19 \nstartups were contacted: 10 startups from developed countries\
    \ including such \ncountries as the USA, Germany, Austria, Australia, the Netherlands\
    \ and the United \nKingdom; and 9 startups from developing countries such as India,\
    \ Indonesia, the \n!43\nPhilippines, the Ukraine, Israel, Tanzania and Nigeria.\
    \ 11 of them agreed to \nparticipate in the interviews. Each interview lasted\
    \ between 40 and 70 minutes. To \nbetter structure the in-depth interviews, a\
    \ guideline questionnaire with open \nquestions was prepared. The questionnaire\
    \ contained questions about the \nfounders, product development, early adopters\
    \ and the startup’s network. Most of \nthe interviews were recorded via Skype\
    \ conversations. Each interview was then \ntranscribed on the same day. Table\
    \ 4 showcases the information gleaned from the \nstartups interviewed. \n*Country\
    \ division according to “developed” and “developing” is based on the report of\
    \ the United \nNations (2014) \nTable 4: Overview of the digital agricultural\
    \ startups interviewed \nIn the case of the research presented here, the 11 interviews\
    \ took place over two \nmonths. The number of the interviewee’s abbreviation is\

    \ that was \ninterviewed, followed by I 2, I 3, etc.. After each interview, there\
    \ was an at least \ntwo-day-long break to analyze the interview, to code the interviewee’s\
    \ perception \nof his/her startup’s growth, to categorize and to summarize it\
    \ for ensuing analysis. \n11 interviews were enough to achieve data saturation\
    \ because there were no new \nnovel insights  gained during the last three interviews\
    \ (Guest et al., 2006, p.68).  \n3\nTo analyze the data obtained from the in-depth\
    \ interviews, the coding method was \nused. “A code in qualitative inquiry is\
    \ most often a word or short phrase that \nsymbolically assigns a summative, salient,\
    \ essence-capturing, and/or evocative \nattribute for a portion of language-based\
    \ or visual data” (Saldaña, 2009, p.3). The \ntype of coding used in this work\
    \ was a descriptive code. This type of coding \nsummarizes, with one or two words,\
    \ a sense of one or more sentences within the \ndata. This type of code is especially\
    \ helpful during the initial round of coding to get \na first impression of the\
    \ data collected and its content. The aim of a coding \nprocess is to detect patterns\
    \ in the qualitative data. In the case of the research \npresented here, the similar\
    \ patterns in the growth perceptions of the founders were \nexplored. \nTo spot\
    \ the patterns, it is necessary to perform several cycles of coding and \ncategorizing\
    \ the data obtained. To make the coding process more efficient and \nstructured,\
    \ a Computer Assisted Data Analysis Software (CAQDAS) is normally \nused. There\
    \ are three software programs most often used to analyze qualitative \ndata: ATLAS.ti,\
    \ MAXQDA and NVivo (Saldaña, 2009). \nFor the analysis of the data from the present\
    \ in-depth interviews, ATLAS.ti. \n(Version 8.2.4 (559))  was utilized. In the\
    \ scientific literature, it is possible to find a \n4\nsoftware guide for ATLAS.ti\
    \ (Friese, 2014), as well as several case studies of the \nsoftware’s use (Hwang,\
    \ 2008). This software has already been used in the area of \nagriculture, for\
    \ example, for learning about farmers’ beliefs in Austria, Cuba and \nIsrael regarding\
    \ the trial of something new on their organic farms (Leitgeb et al., \n No new\
    \ codes were gained in the last three interviews\n3\n ATLAS.ti Scientific Software\
    \ Development GmbH\n4\n!45\n2011) or the adoption of web-based spatial tools by\
    \ agricultural producers (Jarvis \net al., 2017). For the purpose of this research,\
    \ ATLAS.ti helped to structurally \nanalyze qualitative data, identify connections\
    \ between the interviews, and to keep \nrecords of the observations during the\
    \ analysis. \nThe interviews were, at first, manually transcribed and imported\
    \ to the qualitative \ndata analysis software ATLAS.ti. The results of the interviews\
    \ come from five \nrounds of coding, where the categories were rearranged three\
    \ times and the \nresulting data was compared. The first round of coding provided\
    \ a general \nimpression of the interviews and numerous initial assumptions; the\
    \ following \nrounds sought to converge the initial assumptions in all the interviews\
    \ into a set of \ncore assumptions which were mentioned by most interviewees.\
    \ In the first round, \nthere were 31 categories that described the main assumptions\
    \  made by the \n5\ninterviewees. Among those assumptions were such categories\
    \ as business model, \nfamily and friends, and early adopters’ or cofounders’\
    \ motivation. In the following \nrounds, those categories were rearranged and\
    \ condensed to seven main patterns. \nEach of the seven categories represents\
    \ a description of a startup's perspective of \nthe situation on the agricultural\
    \ market, its target group, its growth and the \nchallenges it faces. These seven\
    \ patterns are: 1) low frequency of the IT solution \nuse (due to high costs,\
    \ little competition or technology scarcity); 2) the difficulty to \ndemonstrate\
    \ the results of the solution; 3) lack of trust due to newness of the \ncompany;\
    \ 4) the importance of joint development with customers; 5) mass media \nas a\
    \ contributor to fast growth; 6) interpersonal communication as the most \neffective\
    \ communication channel; 7) cooperation regarding education and \ndistribution\
    \ as a scalable model for interpersonal communication. To provide a \nbetter overview\
    \ of the results, these seven patterns were divided into two major \ngroups: obstacles\
    \ on the market and marketing strategies. \nTo verify the patterns obtained from\
    \ the interviews, the data triangulation method \nwas used. To compare the results\
    \ of the interviews, other existing studies and \ninformation published by farmers\
    \ in the forums and app stores were taken into \naccount.  \n The codes are presented\
    \ in Annex 8.2\n5\n!46\nTo carry out the data triangulation, statistical data\
    \ and relevant studies that were \nmade in the past 10 years were selected (from\
    \ 2007 till 2017). For the study \nsearch, the following scientific data bases\
    \ were used: Google Scholar, science \ndirect, Jstore, Econis, AgEcon. As a result,\
    \ more than 50 studies and statistical \nsources were reviewed. Furthermore, 23\
    \ additional sources were selected, such \nas interviews conducted by third parties\
    \ with some of the startup-founders who \nparticipated in the current in-depth\
    \ interviews, and published in online media such \nas blogs, magazines and newspapers;\
    \ comments of users in forums and app \nstores concerning the products that startups\
    \ presented on the market. Those \ncomments were found on such forums as “the\
    \ digitalfarmer”, “agrowissen”, \n“thefarmingforum”, “id.techasia”, and on Google\
    \ Play. This data concerned 9 out of \n11 of the startups interviewed. Two of\
    \ the startups also enjoy a definite presence in \nthe press. However, the information\
    \ presented in those sources had a generally \ndescriptive character about a service\
    \ or the startup itself. \n4.3 Results of the in-depth interviews \n4.3.1 Market\
    \ obstacles on the agricultural market from the startup \nperspective \nThe analysis\
    \ of the in-depth interviews revealed three main obstacles on the \nmarket, which\
    \ most of the startups interviewed mentioned: low frequency of the IT \nsolution\
    \ use, the difficulty to scale the demonstration of the results and lack of trust\
    \ \ndue to newness of the company. The assumptions made by the startups during\
    \ the \ninterviews that underline these selected barriers are presented below\
    \ in Table 5. \nOne of the common assumptions made by the startups interviewed\
    \ concerned the \nlow frequency of IT solutions used among farmers. The quotes\
    \ represented below \n(Table 5) reveal three main explanations of that phenomena.\
    \ One possible \nexplanation is that there are not many competitors within the\
    \ online IT solutions \nsector. In the developing countries there is an additional\
    \ challenge that makes the \nspread of the technology more difficult: restricted\
    \ access to the Internet and/or \nscarcity of mobile devices. The third possible\
    \ explanation to the low frequency of \nIT use of is the high price of the new\
    \ high-tech equipment. \n!47\nThe second obstacle to growth on the market appeared\
    \ due to issues with the \nscalability of the results demonstrability. As mentioned\
    \ in several quotes in Table 5, \nthe technology was stated to be used only if\
    \ neighbors are also using it. However, \nthe adoption of the technology does\
    \ not spread further and remains a “hot-spot” in \ncertain regions. \nThe last\
    \ obstacle is the company’s newness on the market. Farmers are often \nskeptical\
    \ about the company and the solution that it offers because, independently \n\
    of how good it is, if something goes wrong and the company does not exist \nanymore,\
    \ it is unclear who should help solve the problem and update the solution. \n\

    \ \nQuote from the interviews\n!49\n4.3.2 Data triangulation: the market obstacles\
    \  \nThe three challenges that startups identified as their main barriers to growth\
    \ – the \nlow frequency of IT solution use (due to high costs, low level of competition\
    \ or \ntechnology scarcity), the difficulty to scale the demonstrability of the\
    \ solution’s \nresults and the lack of trust (caused by the company’s newness)\
    \ – will be \ntriangulated with the farmers’ opinions (those who were using the\
    \ solution or \nconsidering doing so) as well as agricultural studies on this\
    \ topic. \nIn an interview with the Australian “Stock journal”, one of the farmers\
    \ who reported \nabout the technology use on his farm and especially about the\
    \ product of [I11]’, \nunderlined that “critical to the success will be good farm\
    \ software packages that \nare intuitive” (Miller, 2017).  \nBeyond the ease of\
    \ use, the customers of the startups interviewed are also \nconcerned about another\
    \ problem that was not named by the interviewees: \ncompatibility of their technology\
    \ with existing ones. One farmer who considered \nusing the solution of [I11]\
    \ mentioned on the “the digital farmer” forum in 2015: \n“Tired of every application\
    \ running just one segment of my farm.” This problem \nwas also mentioned by another\
    \ farmer at the same forum. Although the farm is \nsmall, the owners run copious\
    \ amounts of documentation. Having one solution for \nthis documentation is important.\
    \  \n6\nCost as a barrier was also mentioned by the farmers who were considering\
    \ use \nof the [ I2 ] solution. In this quote from the “landwirt.com\" forum,\
    \ a participant \nwrote, on January 17, 2018, at 12:09 pm, the following about\
    \ his purchase \ndecision [translation from German] “Here are the advantages that,\
    \ for me, were \ndecisive for purchasing this product: 1) I could easily just\
    \ purchase a tablet instead \nof an expensive computer; 2) no fees for signal\
    \ corrections that are automatically \ngenerated through the station (radius 10\
    \ km); 3) 100 EUR for a software \nmaintenance license, which is constantly further\
    \ developed (meanwhile, to use the \nsoftware of other companies you need to buy\
    \ a new computer after a certain \n6 The review to the product of the interviewed\
    \ startup http://www.thedigitalfarmer.com.au/product/\nagriwebb-notebook (04.08.2019)\n\
    !50\nperiod of time).”   \n7\nAlthough the startups interviewed are aware of the\
    \ price problem and are offering \ncheaper solutions in comparison to existing\
    \ companies, the advantages offered \nare still insufficient. Here is a quote\
    \ from the forum on the “landwirt.com\" website \nfrom January 7, 2018 about the\
    \ solution offered by startup [ I2 ]: “For my small \nfarm, the solution unfortunately\
    \ is not economically viable, even though the price in \ncomparison to other companies\
    \ is low.”  \n8\nThe infrequent use of the online applications for farmers in\
    \ the developing \ncountries has additional dimensions, such as a lack of infrastructure\
    \ or mobile \ntechnology that allows internet use (like a smartphone or a tablet).\
    \ One of the co-\nfounders of the Indonesian startup, [ I9 ], mentioned infrequent\
    \ use of the \ntechnology due to non-availability of smartphones (translated from\
    \ Indonesian): \n”Supply depends on the number of farmers who want to use our\
    \ application to sell \ntheir products, but farmers rarely use smartphones and\
    \ applications.” (Viva, 2017)  \nThe difficulty of using the online solution by\
    \ the Tanzanian startup lies in the \ngeneral scarcity of smartphones, as confirmed\
    \ a study conducted by Mwakaje \n(2010). According to the study’s results, the\
    \ use of ICT is constrained by costs, \naccessibility, and reliability. A large\
    \ number of respondents (68%) said that they did \nnot have the money to buy the\
    \ ICT facilities or services. \nHowever, even in a developed country like Germany,\
    \ the advantages of Internet \nsolutions for smartphones or tablets are not necessarily\
    \ being used by the majority \nof farmers. In 2013, the latest study of agriMA\
    \ (readers’ analysis of the \nnewspapers’s market for the agricultural sector)\
    \ revealed that more than 52% of \nfarmers surveyed in Germany use the Internet\
    \ for their business every day, \nalthough only a few farmers use a smartphone\
    \ for their business activities. Mostly, \nfarmers do not use a specific software\
    \ or device to manage their business \n7 The link to the original comment: https://www.landwirt.com/Forum/551698/efarmer-GPS.html\

    \ \n(04.08.2019)\n!51\nprocesses, but weather apps, text messages or news bulletins.\
    \  \nThe last obstacle mentioned by the startups was a lack of trust. A positive\
    \ \nperception of a company and trust in its services or products by its customers\
    \ is \nthe basis for customer loyalty and word-of-mouth (Seja, 2012). In the interview\
    \ \nwith the blog “Samfloy”, the founder of startup [ I5 ] again mentioned the\
    \ \nimportance of trust: “Similar to anything that involves a behavior change,\
    \ people \nneed to be able to trust what they’re doing. We need to make sure that\
    \ farmers \nand buyers feel that they can rely on the [ I5 ] platform” (Floy,\
    \ 2017). \nThere are several studies that explored the question of the importance\
    \ of trust in \ntechnology adoption within the agricultural field. Chi and Yamada\
    \ (2002) \ndiscovered that, among the most important factors affecting farmers’\
    \ opinions \nregarding farming system technologies in Vietnam, were trust in the\
    \ respective \ntechnicians as well as result demonstrability. Another study which\
    \ was conducted \nin Greece, Italy and Turkey through in-depth, face-to-face interviews\
    \ and focus \ngroups with different players from the agricultural sector (e.g.\
    \ technology \nproviders, farm co-ops, researchers, medium-sized and large farms)\
    \ showed that \nthere is some distrust, especially if the farmer does not have\
    \ enough experience \nwith the technology (Pignatti et al., 2015). The authors\
    \ of the study discovered that \n“in-field demonstrations, pilot farms and farmers,\
    \ along with successful \nexperiences of technological innovations’ implementation,\
    \ could fasten the process \nof awareness and trust raising, and seem to be the\
    \ most convincing reason to \nadopt innovations and spread them among end-users”\
    \ (Pignatti et al., 2015, p.79). \nAccording to the results of the in-depth interviews\
    \ and the data triangulation, such \nobstacles as price, lack of trust and not\
    \ obvious benefits of the technology \nrepresent one group of the factors why\
    \ farmers are unwilling to use a new \ntechnology. Additionally farmers named\
    \ the ease of use and compatibility of the \ntechnology as important determinants\
    \ in the decision-making process. These \nfactors were not mentioned by the startups\
    \ but came from the comments of the \npotential users. \n!52\nIn the developing\
    \ countries insufficient infrastructure and low frequency of \nsmartphone use\
    \ were also verified by the studies and further interviews with the \nstartups\
    \ that took part in the research presented here. \n4.3.3 Marketing strategies\
    \ to achieve growth on the agricultural market \nAccording to the interviews it\
    \ was possible to determine four major marketing \nstrategies that agricultural\
    \ startups apply to achieve growth on the market. The first \nwas user-oriented\
    \ product development, the second was use of the mass media, \nthe third was attending\
    \ events (such as fairs or product presentations) and the last \nwas cooperation\
    \ with distributors or for educational purposes to overcome growth \nbarriers\
    \ and build faster trust. The quotes from the interviews that support these \n\
    findings are presented below in Table 6. \nTo overcome the risk of infrequent\
    \ technology use, several startups decided to \ndevelop their product along with\
    \ their potential customers. One of the interviewees \naffirmed that it does not\
    \ really matter what kind of product you have; what is \nimportant is how the\
    \ product is developed and how you build the relationship with \nyour users. A\
    \ couple of startups presented a very basic product with a minimal \nnumber of\
    \ features to get their first users on board. With these users, they started \n\
    developing a product that was intended to satisfy the needs of a later majority.\
    \ \nThus, even without a fully functional product, some startups managed to build\
    \ their \nfirst audience. After the first prototype demonstration or product release,\
    \ first the \nearly adopters actively participated in the further product development.\
    \ Often, the \nfirst testers who influenced the development of the solution came\
    \ from the \nstartup’s family and circle of friends. Such connections were usually\
    \ used at the \nstarting point for proving the viability of their concept, but\
    \ not for further growth. \nA further strategy that was mentioned by almost all\
    \ startups interviewed was use \nof the mass media. Several startups mentioned\
    \ that articles in agricultural \nmagazines helped them gain new customers. Articles\
    \ about a product in the daily \npress helped them gain the attention of potential\
    \ partners or other journalists.  \n!53\nHowever, this kind of endorsement works\
    \ only for a short period of time, according \nto the in-depth interviews. New\
    \ customers appear when news about the respective \nstartup has already been published.\
    \ Later, the growth rate stabilizes and is more \nor less the same as before the\
    \ appearance in the press.  \nAnother important channel that works well, according\
    \ to the startups, is direct \ncontact with farmers. To get directly in touch\
    \ with farmers, startups attend various \nevents. Some even organize such events\
    \ to motivate farmers to test their \nsolutions. Many startups presented their\
    \ product for the first time at fairs. Several \nstartups mentioned that they\
    \ also use events as an opportunity to establish \ninfluential contacts with potential\
    \ partners who can either become investors or \nconnect them with important customers.\
    \ \nOther strategies for growth that several startups use involve various types\
    \ of \ncooperation. All startups face the challenge of expanding their product\
    \ or service \nto other countries or regions. To start growing in a new region,\
    \ a number of agents \nshould be sent there to present the product, as direct\
    \ contact is the most effective \ncommunication channel with farmers, according\
    \ to the interviews presented here. \nHowever, this model does not allow a startup\
    \ to expand rapidly. A few startups \nfound a solution to this problem through\
    \ partnering with other companies or non-\ngovernmental organizations. The main\
    \ advantage for the partner in such a \ncooperation is the additional value for\
    \ their own services. For startups, the \npartnership helps overcome trust problems,\
    \ because those companies often have \ndirect contact with a number of farmers\
    \ and have built their reputation already. \nSuch cooperations often have several\
    \ purposes, among which are distribution \nand/or education. Cooperations with\
    \ NGOs or institutions are often used for \neducational purposes, wherein farmers\
    \ have an immediate opportunity to test the \ntechnology to see how it works and\
    \ what benefits it can bring. In this sense, these \ncooperations work as distributors\
    \ at the same time. Cooperation with companies, \nin most cases, serves as a pure\
    \ distributional channel. However, as is the case \nwith one of the startups,\
    \ a respected corporation can also improve the status of a \nstartup on the market\
    \ and thus help gain the trust of more potential customers.  \n!54\nThe table\
    \ below presents specific quotes from the interviews that emphasize the \nmarketing\
    \ strategy patterns among the startups. \nMarketing strategies\nQuote from the\

    \ farm \nmanagement system, which could be used in any country, but it \ndid not\
    \ have any special reports or specifications which were \nnecessary in certain\
    \ countries. That was the moment when we \nstarted asking our existing clients\

    \ the \ntriangulation of this strategy previous studies about joint product development\

    !57\nconducted a large-scale empirical study with managers in the machinery industry.\
    \ \nThe results showed a positive impact on new product success. The best time\
    \ to \ninvolve the customers in development, according to the study, is in the\
    \ early and \nlate stages. Most of the startups interviewed did it at the early\
    \ stages, when the \nproduct was extant and the users tested it to find errors\
    \ and to improve usability. \nAnother important insight from the Gruner and Homburg\
    \ (2000) study is that \nleading users or financially attractive customers are\
    \ the most suitable for the \ninvolvement in the development process. In most\
    \ of the cases, the startups \ninterviewed involved friends or acquaintances in\
    \ the early stage of the solution \ndevelopment process. In the literature overview\
    \ about the aspects of consumer co-\ncreation during product development, Hoyer\
    \ et al. (2010) found out that the \ninvolvement of the customers increases product\
    \ effectiveness, which in turn \nincreases the commercial attractiveness of new\
    \ products. \nTo triangulate the importance of the various informational channels\
    \ that startups \nuse to spur growth, such as mass media, events and cooperation,\
    \ the farmers’ \nfeedback about their source of information will be utilized,\
    \ as well as studies in the \nagricultural field regarding the importance of the\
    \ various informational sources. \nAccording to the interviews, there are two\
    \ major communication channels: mass \nmedia and direct contact to the farmers.\
    \ Some startups decided to build additional \ncooperation with NGOs and distributors\
    \ to be able to scale the interpersonal \ncommunication. \nIn the interviews,\
    \ some startups mentioned a positive influence on their growth \nrate coming from\
    \ classical media sources, e.g. magazines and newspapers that \nare specialized\
    \ in agriculture. In theory, “mass media channels are relatively more \nimportant\
    \ than interpersonal channels for earlier adopters than for later \nadopters”\
    \ (Rogers, 1983, p.201). Later, adopters become more trusting of local \nexperience\
    \ and interpersonal channels (Rogers, 1983).  \nOn Google Play (app store), i.e.\
    \ on the app page of one of the startups interviewed \n[ I10], one of the product\
    \ users left the following review on his experience with the \nproduct and his\
    \ source of information: \n“Useless if you don't specifically live in Germany,\
    \ Scandinavia, India or Brazil. Chose \n!58\nScandinavia and it only has fruit\
    \ plants/trees and herbs. Saw it on Euronews but they \nfailed to mention these\
    \ information.” - Amir Banuazizi January 5, 2017 \nUnfortunately, it was hard\
    \ to find similar mass media references for other startups. \nThat is why for\
    \ further data triangulation the latest studies (from 2012 to 2017) \nabout the\
    \ importance of different informational channels in the decision-making \nprocess\
    \ for farmers were used. According to agriMa research (2013), in Germany, \na\
    \ weekly newspaper is the preferred source of information. 45% of the \nrespondents\
    \ see it as an important source. In the study of Yaseen et al. (2016), in \nPakistan,\
    \ more than 48% out of 160 Punjab farmers questioned ranked the media \nas the\
    \ third most important source of information. Another study in Indian \nMaharashtra,\
    \ with 175 participants, revealed that for 62% of the participants, \nnewspapers\
    \ were the second preferred source of information, directly behind \nfellow farmers\
    \ (Bachhav, 2012).  \nAccording to a study in Nigeria, the mass media was the\
    \ third most favorable \nsource of information about new farming practices, following\
    \ extension agents and \nfellow farmers (Mgbakor et al., 2013). A further study\
    \ of farmers in India found out \nthat farmers normally do not use only one source\
    \ of information, instead they try to \nbe diverse (Mittal and Mehar, 2015). The\
    \ study covered 1200 farming households \nin the most important agricultural regions\
    \ in India. The results show that 28% of \nfarmers who participated in the study\
    \ replied that they prefer “face-to-face” \ncommunication during various types\
    \ of meetings with various players (fairs, NGOs, \nState Department of Agriculture,\
    \ State Agricultural University, cooperatives, \nmiddlemen, shops, dealers, etc.)\
    \ and “other farmers” (farmers or relatives in the \nvillage or neighborhood)\
    \ and traditional media (TV, radio, newspapers). As a \nsource of information,\
    \ 17.8% use “face-to-face” and “other farmers”, and 21.6% \neven use four sources\
    \ of information at the same time: “face-to-face”, “other \nfarmers”, “traditional\
    \ media”, and “modern information and telecommunication \ntechnology” (Mittal\
    \ and Mehar, 2015). \nApparently, “face-to-face” is also a preferable and important\
    \ source of information \nabout new technology in Australia. In the interview\
    \ with the Australian \"Stock \nJournal”, a farmer who is an active user of new\
    \ technologies, such as yield \n!59\nmonitors and the solution of the [ I11 ]\
    \ startup, gives the following piece of advice: \n“Don’t be dismissive of new\
    \ technology or techniques. If you don’t know how to do \nsomething maybe talk\
    \ to someone or employ someone who does – or you will be \nleft behind” (Miller,\
    \ 2017). \nIowa State University, in its annual “The Iowa Farm and Rural Life\
    \ Poll” in 2016, \nwhich included the responses of 1039 farmers (50% of the total\
    \ farmers asked to \nparticipate), discovered that live and face-to-face communication\
    \ is the most \nfavorable method of gleaning information about most topics concerning\
    \ agricultural \nbusiness (Arbuckle, 2016). Among face-to-face communication methods,\
    \ one-on-\none consultations, workshops, training, meetings and field days were\
    \ the most \npreferable sources.  \nThe additional type of marketing channel that\
    \ some of the startups interviewed use \nis cooperation. Cooperation is a process\
    \ wherein different organizations come \ntogether and interact to build mutual\
    \ gain or benefit (Smith et al., 1995). Benefits of \nsuch cooperations could\
    \ include access to resources or skills, new contacts or \nreduced commercial\
    \ risk. Cooperations help startups, among other things, to \nimprove their chances\
    \ of survival on the market and to improve their financial \nperformance (Baum\
    \ et al., 2000). “By forming strategic alliances, startups can thus \npotentially\
    \ access social, technical, and commercially competitive resources that \nnormally\
    \ require years of operating experience to acquire” (Baum et al., 2000, p.\n270).\
    \ In the scientific literature, it is possible to distinguish different goals\
    \ for \ncooperation: distribution, promotion, social responsibility, development\
    \ of a \ntechnology or product. According to the case study about the implementation\
    \ and \nadaptation of precision farming technologies, a collaborative approach\
    \ is one of \nthe requirements for successful innovation and diffusion (Eastwood\
    \ et al., 2017). \nIn the in-depth interviews, startups mentioned two main purposes\
    \ of their \ncooperations: distribution and education. The main purpose of such\
    \ cooperations, \nfrom the startups’ perspective, is to overcome the problem of\
    \ scaling the \ninterpersonal communication and thus reduce mistrust among farmers\
    \ towards \nnew technology. In the previous chapter, several studies revealed\
    \ that the farmers’ \n!60\nlack of IT skills often keeps them from using new technology\
    \ (Stricker et al., 2003; \nFountas et al., 2005; Lima et al., 2018). \nIn another\
    \ interview with the online-blog “Samfloy”, the founder of the startup [I5] \n\
    mentioned an NGO that is going to educate farmers on how to use the product of\
    \ \na startup; it will also explain the product’s benefits (Floy, 2017). \nThe\
    \ startup [ I10 ] gained, thanks to the cooperation with the International Crops\
    \ \nResearch Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT), new satisfied users\
    \ in \nIndia. ICRISAT organized a workshop for agricultural stakeholders in 2017\
    \ in \nSouth India. Apparently, the results of the workshop were very positive,\
    \ according \nto some comments on Google Play. Here are some examples of the comments:\
    \ \n“Excellent App. Salute ICRISAT” - user Venu Gopal Pochiraju, on the June 13,\
    \ 2017  \n“very useful app congrats to ICRISAT team” -  user nainaboina suresh\
    \ May 25, 2017 \nSome users even thought that the product was made by the cooperation\
    \ partner \nitself:  \n“Very useful app developed by icrisat congratulations”\
    \ - user Samrat Reddy May 25, 2017 \n“Congrats to ICRISAT” - ratna sekhar June\
    \ 3, 2017 \nThe cooperation with ICRISAT was mentioned in one of the interviews\
    \ with one of \nthe co-founders of startup [ I10 ]. “In ICRISAT, we found a strong\
    \ partner with an \nimpressive expertise on crops planted in the semi arid tropics.\
    \ In collaboration with \nICRISAT then, a database is built up related to the\
    \ main topics for these crops. In \naddition to the scientific support, plans\
    \ are made to use [ I10 ]’s technology within \nICRISAT’s extension network that\
    \ assists farmers in Telangana and Andhra \nPradesh. Extension officers supported\
    \ by ICRISAT can help us to adapt this \ntechnology right to the needs of local\
    \ farmers” (Dias, 2016). \nTwo startups mentioned the cooperation only for distributional\
    \ purposes. To verify \nthe assumption, the website of startup [ I2 ] was investigated\
    \ in June 2017. Some \nof the distributional partners with links to the partner’s\
    \ website were listed there \nand distributional partners in the following countries\
    \ were identified: the Czech \nRepublic, Latvia and the Ukraine. Confirmation\
    \ about a cooperation between \n!61\nanother startup interviewed, [ I11 ], and\
    \ Bayer could be found on the website of \nBayer’s Grow program , where the free\
    \ trial version of the startup’s solution is \n9\nadvertised. The “Grow solutions”\
    \ website introduces Bayer partnerships in the field \nof new technologies. “The\
    \ Bayer team and Grow partners are essential elements \nin giving farmers the\
    \ best possible programs.” Additionally, recommendations for a \ntrial version,\
    \ as well as information regarding the startups’ solution and its \nadvantages,\
    \ were given. \nTriangulated data supported the patterns identified from the in-depth\
    \ interviews in \nthe area of communication channels for the acquisition of new\
    \ customers. Mass \nmedia was one of the most often-used channels, according to\
    \ the in-depth \ninterviews. In most of the studies, this source of information\
    \ is counted among the \ntop three. Various types of events, where the startups\
    \ could directly contact \nfarmers, also proved to be vital, since “face-to-face”\
    \ contact plays an even more \nimportant role as a source of information than,\
    \ in some cases, mass media.  \nSince interpersonal communication is one of the\
    \ most effective methods, but \ndifficult to scale, according to the in-depth\
    \ interviews, some startups decided to \nsolve this problem by starting cooperations\
    \ with stakeholders mostly from the \nagricultural sector to educate farmers or\
    \ to demonstrate the solutions at new \npoints of distribution. This last type\
    \ of channel was not used by all the startups \ninterviewed, but it represents\
    \ an interesting case, through which, according to the \ntriangulated data, startups\
    \ can even serve as a bridge to new markets – as has \nhappened in the cases of\
    \ startups [ I2 ] and [ I10 ]. \nTo find out which of the strategies explored\
    \ could play a decisive role in the \nachievement of critical mass, digital startups\
    \ with critical mass will be selected, \nand their strategies will be compared\
    \ with the ones that still have not yet achieved \ncritical mass.\P\n https://www.growsolutions.com.au/en/about-us/partnerships/\
    \ (04.12.2018)\n9\n!62\n5 Detailed investigation of the marketing strategies that\
    \ lead to \nthe achievement of critical mass, using the example of German \nfarm\
    \ management startups  \nThe analysis of the in-depth interviews helped gain a\
    \ broad overview regarding the \nchallenges of the digital agricultural startups\
    \ and their marketing strategies. To be \nable to answer the question of exactly\
    \ how precision farming startups can achieve \ncritical mass, the main focus will\
    \ be on German digital startups in the area of farm \nmanagement that have already\
    \ achieved critical mass. To obtain internal \ninformation about the marketing\
    \ strategies and type of customers, a telephone \ninterview based on a structured\
    \ questionnaire was carried out. \nFor the purpose of this research, critical\
    \ mass will be defined as a market share \nbetween 10% and 20%, according to the\
    \ diffusion of innovation theory (Rogers, \n1983). To calculate the market share,\
    \ not only the number of customers but also \nthe customers’ turnover market share\
    \ will be considered.  \nThe German startups were selected because they sell their\
    \ digital solutions on the \nEuropean market, where a problem with the diffusion\
    \ of precision farming \ntechnologies exists (EIP-AGRI, 2015). The strategies\
    \ that German startups use \ncould be also considered by other European digital\
    \ agricultural startups and other \ninternational startups that also face the\
    \ same problem on the market.  \nThe farm management information system was chosen\
    \ as a technology because, \naccording to Gartner’s Hype Cycle (Figure 11), it\
    \ has already achieved “the slope \nof enlightenment”, where critical mass for\
    \ this type of technology takes place \n(Jarolímek et al., 2017, p.70). A farm\
    \ management information system (FMIS), in \nthis paper, will be defined as “a\
    \ planned system of the collecting, processing, \nstoring and disseminating of\
    \ data in the form of information needed to carry out the \noperations functions\
    \ of the farm” (Salami and Ahmadi, 2010, p. 90). The \narchitecture of the FMIS\
    \ includes personal computers, mobile terminals, tablets, \nsensors, authorities,\
    \ farm partners, external online services / databases and \nadvisors (Salami and\
    \ Ahmadi, 2010, p. 90). Existing FMIS are “independent \nsoftware running on the\
    \ user’s computer with connectivity to the FMIS provider’s \n!63\ndatabase or\
    \ a complete web-based FMIS application” (Kaloxylos et al., 2012, p. \n132) \n\
    Figure 12: Structure of the FMIS (adopted from Kaloxylos et al., 2012, p. 132)\
    \ \nThis type of software usually has one or several functions for certain types\
    \ of \noperations on a farm. The fragmented functionality and incompatibility\
    \ with other \nFMIS cause the problem of information integration, which is collected\
    \ by different \nFMIS (Sørensen et al., 2010). The issues with data integration\
    \ from different types \nof FMIS was also identified by the EIP-AGRI (2015) as\
    \ a possible barrier for the \nwidespread use of this technology in the EU, which\
    \ is going to be considered for \nthe development of the hypothesis mentioned\
    \ below \n!64\n5.1 Hypotheses \nIn order to formulate the hypotheses for the questionnaire\
    \ about marketing \nstrategies and later for the case study, not only theories\
    \ presented in the third \nchapter were used, but also the results of the in-depth\
    \ interviews from the previous \nchapter and the suggestions of the 19 experts\
    \ of the EIP-AGRI (2015).  \n5.1.1 Hypotheses concerning the technological aspects\
    \ of marketing \nstrategy \nH1: Startups that have achieved critical mass provide\
    \ feasible advantages for the \nfarmers \nThe topic of technology usefulness was\
    \ mentioned in three out of the four main \ntheories about innovation adoption\
    \ that were presented in chapter three: TAM, \nTID, UTAUT. Usefulness, in the\
    \ theory, was defined as the perceived impact on job \nperformance (Davis, 1989).\
    \ The usefulness was selected in several previous \nstudies about precision farming\
    \ where the research objects were the farmers \n(Pierpaoli et al., 2013). In the\
    \ studies reviewed by Pierpaoli et al. (2013), perceived \nusefulness and “ease\
    \ of use” were the main factors that influence precision \nfarming acceptance.\
    \ The usefulness could be predicted by the advantages it offers \nfor the farming\
    \ process (Aubert et al., 2012). Lencsés et al. (2014) investigated the \nimportance\
    \ of the advantages and disadvantages of precision farming. The results \nshowed\
    \ that the most important advantages for farmers are yield increase, income \n\
    increase, reduction in the organizational work on the farm and environmental \n\
    impact. Another important result of the study was the importance of understanding\
    \ \nthe advantages (direct and indirect) of the technology. This was named as\
    \ one of \nthe important factors for innovation adoption by farmers (Lencsés et\
    \ al., 2014; \nRezaei-Moghaddam and Slaehi, 2010). To assess the first hypothesis,\
    \ the \nfounders of the startups will be asked about the advantages and the \n\
    disadvantages of their technologies. Feasible advantages will be, for example,\
    \ the \ncost reduction for pesticide use because of precision spraying or because\
    \ of labor \nefficiency. \n!65\nH2: Startups with critical mass have a free trial\
    \ version \nAnother important component of the model is result demonstrability,\
    \ although this \ncomponent was mentioned only in the extended TAM model. In the\
    \ Theory of the \nDiffusion of Innovation, the importance of the option to try\
    \ an innovation before \ncommitment was one of the important characteristics of\
    \ the innovation. An \nopportunity to see how technology works helps in understanding\
    \ its advantages. \nTo estimate the demonstrability, the existence of a free trial\
    \ version will be \ninvestigated. Free trial versions might reduce the hesitation\
    \ to test new technology \non the field and thus support its adoption. \nTo measure\
    \ trialability, the startup websites and App Stores will be analyzed to find \n\
    information about the trial versions. If that information is not provided online,\
    \ then \nthe founders of the startups will be asked about the test versions during\
    \ the \ninterview. \nH3: Startups with critical mass have compatibility with other\
    \ existing software that \nfarmers use \nCompatibility with the existing work\
    \ process and software that is already being \nused by farmers is an important\
    \ factor that can help increase the acceptance of \nonline farm management systems,\
    \ according to the experts of EIP-AGRI (2015). In \nhis description of the innovation\
    \ characteristics, Rogers (1983) defined \ncompatibility as demonstrating consistency\
    \ with the existing processes, beliefs and \nnorms. “Consistency between existing\
    \ practices and the technology features \npositively impact on the ‘ease of use’\
    \ perception” (Aubert et al., 2012, p.512). To \nmeasure the level of compatibility,\
    \ the startups will be asked if they offer an \napplication programming interface\
    \ (API). API helps, for example, to share content \nand data between different\
    \ web applications or to integrate new functions more \neasily. In other words,\
    \ thanks to API, users do not need to provide, for example, \nany additional data\
    \ to a new software system because it could be gleaned from an \nalready existing\
    \ one. One of the most applied use cases for API is the login, \nwhere, if the\
    \ user does not want to register, he or she can log in via Facebook. \n!66\nThis\
    \ is possible because the website receives the necessary data like e-mail from\
    \ \nFacebook to verify new users; users can directly start using the services\
    \ of a new \nwebsite. \nH4: Startups with critical mass developed their product\
    \ together with the farmers \nInvolvement of the users in the product/solution\
    \ development plays an important \nrole in commercialization (von Hippel, 1976).\
    \ The experts of the EIP-AGRI (2015) \nemphasized that, for the spread of precision\
    \ farming, the solution should be based \non the real farmer’s needs.  \nKaulio\
    \ (1998) identified three types of user involvement for product development: \n\
    design for users, design with users and design by users. Each of these types of\
    \ \ninvolvement has its own methods of product development. In the review of the\
    \ \nexisting joint development methods, Kaulio (1998) identified the following:\
    \  \n• Quality Function Deployment (QFD) is aimed at collecting customer needs\
    \ to \ndesign the product and its production process (Sullivan, 1986). The user\
    \ is \nactively involved only at the specification phase, during which the requirements\
    \ \nfor the product are formulated. Further feedback from the users during the\
    \ \nproduct development process is not required. \n• User-oriented product development\
    \ like QFD collects the product requirements \nfrom users. However, in contrast\
    \ to QFD, users also actively participate in \nprototype testing.  \n• Concept\
    \ testing is a method where the users are asked to give their feedback on \nthe\
    \ ideas and low-fidelity prototypes of the products which are to be developed.\
    \ \n• Beta testing is a method used to receive users’ feedback on the higher-fidelity\
    \ \nprototypes to eliminate possible errors. \n• Consumer-idealized design is\
    \ a method to get feedback on the concept from \npotential users at an early stage.\
    \ In contrast to concept testing, users should \nhelp develop low fidelity prototypes\
    \ or help specify requirements. \n• The lead-user method aims at selecting specific\
    \ users who “face needs that will \nbe general in a market place…, and are positioned\
    \ to benefit significantly by \nobtaining a solution to those needs” (Urban and\
    \ von Hippel, 1998, p.3). \n!67\nThe graph below visualizes each of the methods\
    \ combined with the product \ndevelopment phase and the type of user involvement.\
    \ \nFigure 13: Methods for user involvement in product development (adopted from\
    \ Kaulio, \n1998, p.146) \nTo verify this hypothesis, the startups were asked\
    \ about the methods used to \ndevelop their solution and whether the farmers were\
    \ involved in achieving it. \n5.1.2 Hypotheses concerning the target group and\
    \ communication channels \nH5: Startups with critical mass offer their product/\
    \ solution to large farms  \nRogers (1983) identified a very important type of\
    \ customer that is crucial to the \nspread of the innovation on the market: early\
    \ adopters. Early adopters should work \nas a bridge between innovators and the\
    \ mainstream market. Critical mass takes \nplace somewhere between early adopters\
    \ and the early majority. According to \nseveral studies in the EU (Fountas et\
    \ al., 2005; Warren, 2004; Lencsés et al., \n2014; Steeneveld et al., 2015) and\
    \ in Germany (Reichardt et al., 2009; Paustian \n!68\nand Theuvsen, 2017), the\
    \ early adopters on the market tend to be larger farms \nwith 250 ha. or more.\
    \ Large farms have not only a more substantial budget for \ntesting new technologies,\
    \ but also a greater need for them. According to statistics, \nthe highest costs\
    \ on the farm are operating costs (European Commission, 2011) \nand automation\
    \ helps to reduce this kind of expense. To verify this hypothesis, the \nstartups\
    \ will be asked about the size of their customers’ farms and the share of \nthose\
    \ customers compared with their other users. Then, the number of the large \n\
    farms in the sector and their standard output will be considered, to calculate\
    \ the \nmarket share of the startup. It could be that having only a few large\
    \ farm \ncompanies as customers could be enough to achieve critical mass in terms\
    \ of a \nniche market. \nH6: Startups with critical mass use cooperation for educational\
    \ and/or \ndistributional purposes as an additional interpersonal channel \nH6a:\
    \ Startups that have achieved critical mass cooperate with various \norganizations\
    \ for the purpose of educating farmers \nH6b: Startups that have achieved critical\
    \ mass cooperate with different distributors \nCooperation as one of the solutions\
    \ to scale interpersonal communication was \ndiscovered during the in-depth interviews.\
    \ Some startups acknowledged the \nproblem of drawing the framers’ attention to\
    \ their products. The best way to \npersuade farmers to start using a startup’s\
    \ solution was contacting them directly. \nThat kind of strategy is not scalable\
    \ in the long term. Some startups came up with \nthe solution to cooperate with\
    \ the stakeholders who might also benefit from the \nstartup’s solution themselves\
    \ (such as acquiring statistics about farmers’ output in \ncertain regions that\
    \ otherwise would not be accessible) and/or from the target \ngroup itself (the\
    \ farmers). Cooperation is one of the most researched topics in \npolitics, sociology,\
    \ psychology, anthropology and in economics. “Although \ncooperation has long\
    \ been recognized as crucial to the success of enterprises, \nthere is evidence\
    \ that its role will become even more important in the future \n“ (Smith et al.,\
    \ 1995, p.9). In the technical literature, it was possible to identify a \nnumber\
    \ of objectives of cooperation, e.g. distribution, promotion, social \nresponsibility\
    \ and development of technology/products (Baum et al., 2000, p.270). \n!69\nAccording\
    \ to the in-depth interviews with startups, there are two main types of \ncooperation\
    \ that should facilitate the process of critical mass achievement: \neducational\
    \ and distributional. Education should help reduce the uncertainty level \nregarding\
    \ innovation because farmers often do not adopt due to a lack of \nexperience\
    \ (Lencsés et al., 2014). The level of knowledge about the technology \nalso has\
    \ a positive impact on the perception of its ease of use (Aubert et al., \n2012).\
    \ Cooperation for distribution purposes was also something that some \nstartups\
    \ were employing to win over an additional customer base through third \nparties\
    \ that have already built trusting relationships with farmers. \nH7: Startups\
    \ with critical mass use mass media as one of the main sources to \nspread information\
    \ about their solution \nInformation plays one of the most important roles in\
    \ the diffusion of innovation. \nAccording to Rogers (1983), adoption of a technology\
    \ can take place primarily \nwhen there is awareness of this technology in a social\
    \ system. To achieve \nawareness among potential users, it is necessary to communicate\
    \ information \nabout this technology. As soon as a certain level of awareness\
    \ of the \nconsequences of using the innovation has been achieved, the individual\
    \ can \ndecide either to adopt or to reject it (Rogers, 1983).  \nFigure 14: Adoption\
    \ of the innovation curve due to the two main communication channels \n(adopted\
    \ from Mahajan et al., 1990, p.4)  \n!70\nThe Bass model shows that there are\
    \ two main sources of information: mass \nmedia and word-of-mouth (see the graph\
    \ above) (Mahajan et al., 1990) Innovators \nare the ones who adopt innovation\
    \ due to the mass media and then spread the \nword further to imitators, who adopt\
    \ due to interpersonal communication (Mahajan \net al., 1990). Daberkow and McBride\
    \ (2003) found out that the main informational \nsource about precision farming\
    \ among farmers was mass media. \nTable 7: Hypotheses for the marketing strategies\
    \ to achieve critical mass on the market \nThe formulated hypotheses presented\
    \ in Table 7 above are based on the following \nthree sources: the theory regarding\
    \ technology acceptance, in-depth interviews \nwith the startup founders and expert\
    \ opinions. Experts’ recommendations on the \nmeasures to stimulate the adoption\
    \ of precision farming helped to create a two-\npronged model for marketing strategies\
    \ to achieve critical mass on the market. \nThe first type of strategy concerns\
    \ a technology and its characteristics that are key \nto the achievement of acceptance\
    \ among farmers; the second type of strategy \ndeals with how to approach farmers\
    \ and what kind of farmers to approach so that \na market share of more than 10%\
    \ is gained. \n5.2 Research design and data collection \nTo find online farm management\
    \ startups, the following sources were used: \nf6s.com (which contains thousands\
    \ of startups from all over the world), start-\ngreen.net, dlg-feldtage, FachGruppe\
    \ AgTech; web search results of the keywords: \n“farm management startups” and\
    \ “German agricultural startups”; the German \ninformative portals “deutschestartups”\
    \ and “gründerszene”; previously obtained \ncontacts to startups during the Agritechnika\
    \ fair in Hannover and GIL conference in \n2016. Startups which were acquired\
    \ by major corporations, such as the Berlin \nSource of the \nhypothesis\nTechnology\

    \ from the \nsample. Startups that were acquired normally inherit an additional\
    \ customer base \nfrom a parent company and gain a new level of trust due to now\
    \ being part of a \nwell-known company. Corporate startups were also excluded\
    \ because \ncorporations use their client base to promote new products. Since\
    \ corporations \nhave already achieved critical mass, the task of on-boarding\
    \ existing customers to \nuse a new, additional product is not the same as winning\
    \ completely new \ncustomers for an unknown startup that has only been on the\
    \ market for a short \ntime.  \nThe total number of online farm management startups\
    \ that matched the criteria \nwas 10. Out of the 10 startups, 7 agreed to take\
    \ part in the research. Key \ninformation about the selected startups, sorted\
    \ according to the founding year, is \npresented in Table 8 below:  \nTable 8:\

    \ of a startup, the questionnaire contained \nquestions about the number and the\
    \ size of the customers’ farms. Considering the \nsmall number of the participating\
    \ startups, the qualitative method was suited best \nto collect and analyze the\
    \ results. This time, as the method for data collection, a \ntelephone interview\
    \ was selected.  \nAn interview as a method generally helps capture the events\
    \ in detail under \nnatural conditions (Alshenqeeti, 2014). “A telephone interview\
    \ in research terms is \na strategy for obtaining data which allows interpersonal\
    \ communication without a \nface-to-face meeting” (Carr and Worth, 2001, p.521).\
    \ The telephone interview has \ncertain advantages in comparison to face-to-face\
    \ interviews, e.g. costs and time, \nreducing social influence on the interviewee\
    \ and global access (Carr and Worth, \n2001; Opdenakker, 2006).  \nAll participants\
    \ received the questions used in the interview in advance. In addition \nto the\
    \ telephone interview, online sources were used to obtain unbiased \ninformation\
    \ for testing certain hypotheses. The interview answers and the results \nof the\
    \ online sources of information about the startups interviewed (for example, \n\
    their websites, online articles etc.) were noted in the program “Numbers” (version\
    \ \n5.3) . The answers were noted directly during the telephone conversation.\
    \ The \n11\ninformation obtained during the interview was anonymized in accordance\
    \ with the \nwishes of the interviewees.  \nSince the number of the startups was\
    \ too small to verify the results obtained, a \ndata triangulation method was\
    \ selected. Data triangulation helps verify obtained \ndata by using alternative\
    \ sources of information on the same topic or about the \nsame research object\
    \ (Decrop, 1999).  \nFor the triangulation, already existing German digital agricultural\
    \ companies that \noffer online marketplaces for farmers were selected. Online\
    \ marketplaces and \n The questionnaire is presented in Annex 8.3\n10\n Apple,\

    \ certain on-farm \nprocesses with the help of the Internet and wireless technologies.\
    \ In the case of \nthe online marketplaces, it is easier to purchase necessary\
    \ machinery or plant \nprotection and then also to sell the produce for a better\
    \ price. The online farm \nmanagement systems, using wireless systems, connect\
    \ sensors with the software \nthat optimizes on-farm processes such as harvesting,\
    \ spraying, etc. Both online \nmarketplaces and FMIS improve the value chain in\
    \ the agricultural field and both \ntechnologies use wireless connections to fulfill\
    \ their functions.  \nOnline marketplaces could be defined as “market institutions\
    \ that employ digital \ninformation technology – computers, the Internet, and\
    \ the World Wide Web – to \nprovide trading services to buyers and sellers” (Clasen\
    \ and Mueller, 2006). The \nfirst online farm management software appeared approximately\
    \ 15 years ago \n(Kaloxylos et al., 2012). The first online marketplaces for farmers\
    \ already \nappeared in the 1990s, but the real boom took place at the beginning\
    \ of the 2000s \n(Clasen and Mueller, 2006). Several studies show that farmers\
    \ faced similar \nchallenges when using FMIS and online marketplaces: lack of\
    \ trust, lack of \neducation or training, lack of understanding of technology\
    \ advantages (Reichardt \net al., 2009; Fecke et al., 2018).  \nThe difference\
    \ between online farm management system and the online \nmarketplace is that farm\
    \ management system as a technology has a longer \ndiffusion cycle in comparison\
    \ to the online marketplace, which is viewed as a \nmature market element nowadays.\
    \ According to the Kleffmann Group study \n(2016), approximately 80% of the farmers\
    \ in Germany purchase online. On \naverage, farmers purchase at least 19 times\
    \ per year, as stated in the study. The \nfavorite purchases online are machinery\
    \ and spare parts, followed by workwear \nand office supplies. On the other hand,\
    \ according to a survey of 100 farmers in \nGermany carried out by PriceWaterHouseCoopers\
    \ in 2016, only 29% use anFMIS \nand 3% are testing one (Bovensiepen et al., 2016).\
    \ In the Bitkom report from 2016, \nonly 12% out of 521 interview participants\
    \ from agricultural enterprises use online \nfarm management platforms (Rohleder\
    \ and Krüsken, 2016). \n!74\nTo find companies that would be suitable for data\
    \ triangulation, a list of companies \nthat were presented in Clasen’s dissertation\
    \ (2005) was used. This list was \nenhanced by the newer companies (founded after\
    \ 2003) that were discovered \nduring a web search  conducted using the following\
    \ German keywords: \n12\n“Marktplatz”, “Landwirte”, “Online”, “Kaufen”, “Landmaschine”,\
    \ “Schutzmittel”. In \ntotal, 18 online marketplaces in Germany were found. In\
    \ Table 9 below, the \noverview of the selected marketplaces sorted according\
    \ to the founding year is \npresented.  \nTable 9: Online marketplaces which participated\
    \ in the telephone interviews \nSome of the marketplaces, like landimmo, tec24,\
    \ and landjobs were part of one \nlarge corporation, i.e. Raiffeisen. To obtain\
    \ data about online agricultural \nmarketplaces, a telephone interview was used\
    \ as the method. Six companies that \nrepresent nine online marketplaces participated\
    \ in the interview. The results of the \ntelephone interviews will be presented\

    \ of FMIS startups with critical mass \nTo calculate the market share of each\
    \ startup interviewed, the statistical data \nabout the number of agricultural\
    \ enterprises and their standard output  (SO) was \n13\nanalyzed. The statistical\
    \ data for 2016 was obtained on the German Federal \nMinistry of Food and Agriculture\
    \ website (DESTATIS, 2017) and is presented \nbelow in Table 10.  \nThe startups\
    \ that participated in the telephone interview offer their solutions to \ndifferent\
    \ groups of farmers: from crop to animal farms. One of the startups \ninterviewed,\
    \ for example, offers its services also to hobby gardeners as well as \nsmall\
    \ horticultural farmers. Statistics on the number of hobby gardens is provided\
    \ \nby the federal organization for hobby gardeners (“Bundesverband Deutscher\
    \ \nGartenfreunde e.V.”) in Germany. \nTable 10 below shows the main types of\
    \ customers for which the startups \ninterviewed offer their solutions: crop,\
    \ animal, horticulture farmers and hobby \ngardeners. Additionally, for the purpose\
    \ of the verification hypothesis H5 (which \nsays that startups targeting large\
    \ farms can achieve critical mass more quickly) the \ntarget group was divided\
    \ into two groups: 1) small and medium farms and 2) large \nfarms.  \n13 Starting\
    \ from 1999, there were several changes in the collection of agricultural data.\
    \ The latest \nimportant change was in 2010. Since 2010/2011, farms smaller than\
    \ 5 ha are not included in the \nstatical data, except when those farms have a\
    \ certain number of animals or grow certain types of \nplants. A further important\
    \ change in the collection of the statistical data is that the EU introduced \n\
    new classifications for the size of agricultural enterprises based on farm turnover,\
    \ which is \nmeasured as standard output (SO). The classification of farms is\
    \ now based on the type and \namount of income. According to this classification,\
    \ farming activity could be either a primary or an \nadditional source of income.\
    \ All farms that have SO < 50,000 EUR/per year and less than one \nemployee are\
    \ considered small companies or an additional income. In all other cases, farming\
    \ \nactivities count as the main source of income and as medium or large companies.\
    \ Since there is no \nadditional fixed definition that separates medium and large\
    \ companies according to the Eurostat, \nfor the purpose of this research, the\
    \ large companies will count as those with SO ≥ 1,000,000 EUR, \nand the medium-sized\
    \ companies between 50,000 and 1,000,000 EUR. \n!76\nTable 10: Market estimation\
    \ for the target groups of the FMIS startups \nIn order to measure market share,\
    \ two indicators were used: market share in \nterms of the total number of farms\
    \ and in terms of the SO. That is why the table \nabove displays both the total\
    \ number of farms for each type of customer as well as \nthe SO. These two indicators\
    \ were also calculated for the size of the farms. The \nmarket share in the hobby\
    \ gardener segment could be measured only in total \nnumbers, since this sector\
    \ does not have to provide any statistics about the SO or \nsize of a garden.\
    \ The SO for each segment was calculated as an interval average, \nso it appears\
    \ as an approximate number in the table. \nCritical mass in the research presented\
    \ here was defined according to Rogers \n(1983) as a market share that lies between\
    \ 10 and 20% of the market. To be able \nto calculate the market share, the startups\
    \ were asked to provide a number of \ncustomers and also the number of small,\
    \ medium and/or large-sized farms they \nhave as customers. Based on this information\
    \ and the statistical data presented \nabove in Table 10 a market share for each\
    \ startup interviewed was calculated. \nTable 11 below presents the results of\

    \ software companies that sell their \nown software to the farmers. But S1 plans\
    \ to market their solution directly to the farmers in \nthe future. There is only\
    \ one software company on the German market that is an S1 \ncustomer.  \n** S3\
    \ has only hobby gardeners and small gardeners as its target group. \n*** S5 was\
    \ in the pilot phase and the technology was accessible only to a closed group\
    \ of \ntest customers.    \n**** S7 is also in the test phase and works with a\
    \ few large farms to improve their \nproducts. \nTable 11: Market share of FMIS\
    \ startups which participated in the telephone interview \nThe startups selected\
    \ for the interview were in various stages of development: \nsome were openly\
    \ selling their solutions on the market (S2, S3, S4, S6) others \nwere in the\
    \ test-phase where they had a specific test-group and could not really \nshare\
    \ the actual number of customers (S5, S7). One startup (S1) even decided not \n\
    to sell their solution to the farmers directly, but to cooperate with other IT\
    \ \ncompanies that already have substantial customer bases and develop applications\
    \ \nfor the farm management systems jointly. That is why the table above (Table\
    \ 11) \ndoes not show a market share for each of the startups interviewed. In\
    \ addition to \nthe market share in terms of the total number of farms in the\
    \ sector and SO, a \nniche market represented by the large farms was included,\
    \ since this segment of \nthe market represents early adopters. \nAccording to\
    \ the data presented above (Table 11), only two startups achieved \ncritical mass:\

    \ the whole segment it targets, \nbut only in the niche market (by targeting large\
    \ farms) where it has a penetration \nrate of approximately 24%. If this startup\
    \ should soon win over several large \nfarms, then it can easily gain the missing\
    \ 3% to reach critical mass in terms of SO \non the whole market.  \nIn Table\

    !79\nThe comparison shows that there are only slight differences in the strategies\
    \ \nbetween the startups with and without critical mass. The most common strategies\
    \ \nfor the startups were providing feasible advantages, offering a trial version\
    \ and \nAPI, as well as joint product development. \nStartup S3 with critical\
    \ mass combined two strategies on the German market. One \nof the strategies was\
    \ direct marketing to the customers via mass media; the \nsecond strategy was\
    \ the use of integration (API) as an additional marketing \nchannel and business\
    \ model. Through mass media, the startup could win \napproximately 11% of the\
    \ market. Additional users are gained via the chemical \ncompanies that use the\
    \ startup’s API to help their customers to properly identify a \nplant disease\
    \ and receive better advice on plant protection to cure it or to save the \nrest\
    \ of the healthy plants.  \nTwo other startups (S2, S4) that have achieved critical\
    \ mass have a high \npenetration rate within the niche market represented by large\
    \ farms and a relative \nlow share in the segment of the small and medium enterprises.\
    \ Both startups have \nalmost equal numbers of small and medium-sized farms as\
    \ well as large farms as \ncustomers. However, precisely due to providing solutions\
    \ to the large farms, these \ncompanies could potentially achieve critical mass.\
    \ \nThere were, however, two differences in the marketing strategies between the\
    \ \nstartups with critical mass: 1) cooperation for educational and distributional\
    \ \npurposes and 2) concentration on large companies. Startup S2, which has not\
    \ yet \nachieved critical mass in the whole segment of the market, followed all\
    \ the \nstrategies that were used for the hypotheses. But perhaps the combination\
    \ of the \ntarget group and certain types of strategy play a more important role.\
    \ The idea of \ndifferent strategies for different types of customer groups makes\
    \ sense in times of \nindividualized market-targeting and could also be important\
    \ in the agricultural field \nconsidering different needs and expectations of\
    \ different farm types. As one of the \nco-founders of a farm management startup\
    \ said in the in-depth interview: ”You ask \n50 people what they want to see next\
    \ and you get 48 different answers”. \n!80\nStartup S6 follows almost all the\
    \ strategies that the S3 startup with critical mass \ndoes; the only exception\
    \ is the cooperation for educational purposes, which could \nbe decisive, considering\
    \ the suggestion of the EIP-AGRI (2015) that small and \nmedium-sized companies\
    \ have not yet realized the benefits of the new farm \nmanagement systems. However,\
    \ it is important to mention that startup S6 was \nfounded one year later, making\
    \ a direct comparison difficult. \nTo verify the strategic patterns identified\
    \ from the telephone interviews with FMIS \nstartups, a data triangulation with\
    \ online marketplaces will be made. \n5.4 Data triangulation: German online marketplaces\
    \ and FMIS startups  \nIn the telephone interview with marketplaces, three startups\
    \ that started their \nactivities in 2016 and 2017 took part: one large corporation\
    \ that owns several \nonline marketplaces and four medium-sized companies. One\
    \ of the marketplaces \nis part of an agricultural publishing house. All companies\
    \ wished to remain \nanonymous. To find out if a company had achieved critical\
    \ mass, the interview \npartners were asked about their market share. The startups\
    \ were also asked about \ntheir number of customers.  \nAmong the new marketplaces,\
    \ there was no company that has achieved critical \nmass on the market. One out\
    \ of the three startups interviewed is in a test phase. \nThe marketplaces that\
    \ have achieved critical mass have been on the market \nbetween 15 and 20 years.\
    \ One company owns three marketplaces (marketplaces \nnumbered 4, 5 and 6 in Table\
    \ 9). In the interview, the representative of the \ncompany called special attention\
    \ to the newest marketplace that was founded in \n2004 and sells machinery and\
    \ machinery parts. That is why, in the table below \n(Table 13), the marketing\
    \ and technology strategies of this particular „new“ \nmarketplace were presented.\
    \ One company, despite its long existence on the \nmarket, has still not achieved\
    \ a 10% share of the market. The results of the \ntelephone interview are presented\
    \ in Table 13 below. The number of marketplaces \nhas been taken from Table 9.\
    \ \n!81\nTable 13: Marketing strategies of the online marketplaces which participated\
    \ in the \ntelephone interviews \nThe estimation method used to discern the market\
    \ share for the marketplaces was \nsimilar to the estimation of the market share\
    \ for the FMIS startups. The exceptions \nwere certain older marketplaces where\
    \ not only the approximate number of users \nwas requested, but their own estimation\
    \ of the market share as well. For those \nmarketplaces that achieved critical\
    \ mass, it is possible to separate two main \nstrategies for market penetration:\
    \ 1) through corporate partners; 2) cold calling. \nCold calling  is a new type\
    \ of strategy that was revealed in the interviews about \n14\nthe most effective\
    \ channels for customer acquisition, but it was not included in the \ndata triangulation.\
    \ \nTwo out of three marketplaces with critical mass were founded by corporations\
    \ \nthat at the time had already been on the German agricultural market for a\
    \ while. To \nwin over first customers, the corporations used the existing channels\
    \ to reach \nfarmers. Thus, in the shortest time, they could gain more than 10%\
    \ of the market \nNumber of \nthe \nhypothesis\nStrategies\nNumber of the \ncompanies\

    \ of calling or visiting a possible \ncustomer to try to sell them something without\
    \ being asked by the customer to do so”.\n!82\nin Germany. Today, the main marketing\
    \ channel for those online marketplaces are \nnewsletters or social media and,\
    \ in some cases, cold telephone acquisition. It is \nalso interesting that all\
    \ the online marketplaces with critical mass have an API that \nallows the customers\
    \ to import the information from other existing platforms that \nthey use.  \n\
    The marketplaces that have not achieved critical mass offer no API; only one \n\
    startup is currently developing one. Each of the companies with critical mass\
    \ \ndeveloped partnerships with the stakeholders, e.g. small distributors or export\
    \ \ndistributors. Only one company that still has not achieved critical mass has\
    \ \npartnerships that were arranged by the investors of the company. The companies\
    \ \nwith critical mass also actively invite their users to jointly develop and\
    \ test new \nfeatures of the marketplaces. Only one marketplace that has not yet\
    \ achieved \ncritical mass also does the same. The main customers of the marketplaces\
    \ with \ncritical mass are different: one marketplace has targeted mainly small\
    \ and \nmedium-sized farms, the second has a mixture of a small and medium-sized\
    \ as \nwell as large farms as clients, and the third marketplace works only with\
    \ large farm \nholdings. All the marketplaces that have not yet achieved critical\
    \ mass have small \nand medium-sized farms as customers.  \nThe patterns of the\
    \ online marketplaces’ strategies reveal major differences \nbetween the companies\
    \ with and without critical mass. Cold calling, not included in \nthe table above,\
    \ and use of mass media are the most-used channels among \nonline marketplaces.\
    \ In the telephone interview with the FMIS, some startups also \nmentioned cold\
    \ calling as one of the methods to reach new customers. After the \nmarketing\
    \ strategies of the online marketplaces were compared, the next step was \nto\
    \ compare those strategies with those of the FMIS startups. Cold calling will\
    \ be \nnot used for the comparison, since this type of strategy is not common\
    \ to FMIS \nstartups with critical mass. \nAccording to the results presented\
    \ below in Table 14, all the companies with \ncritical mass followed similar strategies\
    \ except targeting large farms and \n!83\ncooperation for educational purposes,\
    \ which seems to be more common to the \nFMIS startups. \nTable 14: Marketing\
    \ strategy comparison of online marketplaces and FMIS startups with \ncritical\
    \ mass \nCooperation for distribution purposes appears to be an important strategy,\
    \ as 5 out \nof 6 companies with critical mass followed it. All the companies\
    \ with critical mass \ntook the technical aspects of the technology seriously\
    \ and offered feasible \nadvantages, trial versions, the possibility of the integration\
    \ of their functions into \nother products or data sharing as well as joint testing\
    \ of their solution with farmers. \nThe use of mass media as a relevant communication\
    \ channel is also something \ncommon to all the companies. \nThe qualitative investigation\
    \ into the strategies of the marketplaces and FMIS \nstartups with critical mass\
    \ showed some differences in the strategy types. Cold \ncalling as an interpersonal\
    \ channel for online marketplaces with critical mass is an \nimportant source\
    \ for growth, while FMIS startups focus more on online marketing \nor use educational\
    \ cooperations. Two out of three startups with critical mass have \neducational\

    \ an exact recipe for a successful \nmarketing strategy for critical mass achievement,\
    \ it is possible to recommend that \nall startups consider technical aspects of\
    \ the technology, especially the API. \nCompanies without critical mass often\
    \ do not have integrations for data sharing. \nMass media as well as cooperation\
    \ for distribution represent an important \ncommunication channel and are also\
    \ not always used by the companies without \ncritical mass. Concentration on large\
    \ companies in the beginning can help gain a \nsignificant market share in terms\
    \ of the standard output; it could be a good basis \nfor expansion to further\
    \ segments of the market.  \nTo find out more about how the strategies presented\
    \ above work and what impact \nthey have on reaching critical mass, an extremely\
    \ successful German startup, \nPEAT, was studied. As the investigative method,\
    \ a case study was selected, as \nPEAT is currently a unique example of an FMIS\
    \ startup on the agriculture market \nthat could gain impressive growth in several\
    \ countries at once. \n5.5 Case study on how the German startup PEAT has achieved\
    \ critical mass \n5.5.1 Case study as a qualitative method \nCase study is one\
    \ of the most-used qualitative methods, but it was not \nimmediately accepted\
    \ in the social sciences (Yin, 2002). The reason behind the \ndifficulty in using\
    \ the case study was the lack of structure, because there were no \nspecified\
    \ scientific guidelines for defining an object of the case study, data \ncollection\
    \ methods and appropriate methods for analysis (Yin, 1984). The most \noften used\
    \ argument about qualitative research and especially the case study is \nthat\
    \ it is subjective. However, subjective perception is at the same time an \nobjective\
    \ reality, because the fact that “human subjects create, communicate, and \nhold\
    \ are part and parcel of the real world that a social scientist receives as the\
    \ \nsubject matter under investigation” (Lee and Baskerville, 2003, p. 230). The\
    \ case \nstudy is not only a suitable method to explore the subject; it is also\
    \ can be used to \nexplain certain phenomena (Yin, 1984). \n!85\nA case study\
    \ represents an investigation of a complex social phenomenon that \naims to answer\
    \ “why” or “how” questions and preserves important characteristics \nof real-life\
    \ events (Yin, 1984). An object of the case study can be an individual or a \n\
    group, organization, situations, events, programs, activities (Yin, 1984; Hancock\
    \ \nand Algozzine, 2006). For the present case study, the question and the subject\
    \ are \nas follows: How has the German startup PEAT achieved this extraordinary\
    \ growth \nby using the same strategies as some other startups mentioned in the\
    \ research \npresented here.  \nThere are several types of case studies: exploratory,\
    \ descriptive and explanatory \n(Yin, 1984); ethnographical, historical, psychological\
    \ or sociological (Merriam, \n2001); intrinsic, instrumental and collective (Stake,\
    \ 1995). Exploratory studies aim \nat developing certain hypotheses and propositions\
    \ for further research and often \ncontain a “what” question (Yin, 1984). In contrast,\
    \ an explanatory case study looks \nfor answers to certain propositions. A descriptive\
    \ case study seeks to provide a \nthorough description of a certain phenomenon.\
    \ Ethnographic case studies seek to \ndiscover “patterns of behavior, customs,\
    \ and ways of life of a culture-sharing \ngroup” (Hancock and Algozzine, 2006,\
    \ p.31). In a historical case study, previous \nevents are analyzed, in which\
    \ the event’s participants are interviewed, documents \nare investigated to uncover\
    \ factors that caused the event and its results (Hancock \nand Algozzine, 2006).\
    \ In a psychological case study, human behavior is the main \nresearch subject;\
    \ in a sociological case study, the research subjects are social \nphenomena like\
    \ religion, urbanization, politics etc. Intrinsic case studies aim to \ninvestigate\
    \ particular phenomena that generally do not necessarily contribute to a \ngeneralization\
    \ or development of a theory. Instrumental case studies, in contrast, \nseek to\
    \ form a better understanding of a theoretical question or problem (Hancock \n\
    and Algozzine, 2006). Contribution to the theory is one of the main aims of the\
    \ \ncollective case study, where several instrumental case studies serve as the\
    \ basis \nfor developing theories about similar case studies. The present case\
    \ study could \nbe described as an instrumental, descriptive case study. \nAs\
    \ data for the case study, quotes of key participants, interviews, articles, videos,\
    \ \netc. could be used. What is important during data gathering is a diversity\
    \ of the \n!86\nsources to avoid biases and for a better understanding of the\
    \ complexity of a \nsubject (Yazan, 2015). An important strategy to verify the\
    \ results of the case study \nand minimizing incoherencies is by sharing it with\
    \ “those examined in the \nstudy” (Hancock and Algozzine, 2006). This will be\
    \ done in the present case study. \nAccording to Yin, a case study design should\
    \ include the following components: “a \nstudy’s questions; its propositions,\
    \ if any; its unit(s) of analysis; the logic linking the \ndata to the propositions;\
    \ and the criteria for interpreting the findings” (Yazan, 2015, \np.140). Propositions\
    \ or hypotheses represent the conceptual foundation of the \nstudy and are based\
    \ on the literature reviewed (Hancock and Algozzine, 2006).  \nThe model presented\
    \ below, composed of seven hypotheses, will be used as a \nconceptual framework\
    \ for the present case study. For the data interpretation, \ndifferent strategies\
    \ will be selected, as the case study may include quantitative as \nwell as qualitative\
    \ methods for data analysis (Yin, 1984). \nHypothesis\nData\nAnalysis \nmethod\n\

    \ study \n5.5.2 Topic-modeling as a method for quantifying qualitative data \n\
    While working with the qualitative data, it is sometimes difficult to achieve\
    \ an \nunbiased analysis due to the potential subjectivity of the researcher.\
    \ To minimize \nsuch bias during the analysis of the Plantix app reviews and articles\
    \ about PEAT \nand Plantix, one of the text-mining methods, topic-modeling, was\
    \ used. “Topic \nmodeling algorithms are statistical methods that analyze the\
    \ words of the original \ntexts to discover the themes that run through them,\
    \ how those themes are \nconnected to each other, and how they change over time”\
    \ (Blei, 2012, p.77). This \nmethod helps to analyze how “words contained in a\
    \ consumer review reflect a \nlatent set of ideas or sentiments, each of which\
    \ is expressed with its own \nvocabulary” (Büschken and Allenby, 2016, p.2). Consumer\
    \ reviews provide \ninformation about their perception of the technical aspects,\
    \ ease-of-use, \nusefulness, problems and other aspects of a solution. One of\
    \ the basic models for \ntopic modeling is Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).\
    \ This model assumes that there \nis a fixed number of topics in the documents\
    \ being analyzed or, in this case, \nreviews or articles. Each review has a certain\
    \ number of topics (θd), and each topic \nhas a discrete probability distribution\
    \ of words that characterize it (Büschken and \nAllenby, 2016). Words that have\
    \ a high probability of appearing in connection with \nthe topic are then attached\
    \ to that topic. For the purpose of this research, the \nLDAvis model was used.\
    \ “LDAvis is a web-based interactive visualization of topics \nestimated using\
    \ Latent Dirichlet Allocation that is built using a combination of R \nand D3”\
    \ (Sievert and Shirley, 2014 p.63). This model helps visualize the meaning \n\
    of each topic, the relationships between the various topics and the importance\
    \ of \neach topic. In the research presented here the data was analyzed with R\
    \ Version \n3.5.1 GUI 1.70 El Capitan build (7543) in the R Studio Version 1.1.453.\

    Hypothesis\nData\nAnalysis \nmethod\nResults\n!88\nThe LDAvis package visualizes\
    \ the prevalence of the topic in the reviews through \nthe size of the circles.\
    \ The size of the circle shows the proportion of the words that \ncharacterize\
    \ the topic in the whole document. The higher the portion of the terms \nin the\
    \ document is, the bigger the circle is. One of the advantages of LDAvis in \n\
    comparison to the LDA is the possibility to filter terms that have high frequency\
    \ \nonly in a certain topic. In LDA, often words that are most frequent in all\
    \ the \ndocuments and not necessarily specific to that topic appear at the top\
    \ of the terms \nlist (Sievert and Shirley, 2014). This adjustment is important,\
    \ since topic \ninterpretation is not easy (Chang et. al., 2009).  \nTo calculate\
    \ the rank (r) of the word in the topic k, Sievert and Shirley (2014) \ndeveloped\
    \ the following model: where φkw is a probability of the term w ∈ {1,…, V} \n\
    for the number of topics k ∈ {1, …,K}, where V is the number of terms and pw is\
    \ the \nmarginal probability of term w in the corpus. The corpus contains all\
    \ the \ndocuments, or in this case, all reviews or all articles. To determine\
    \ the relevance of \nthe term w in the topic k, the parameter λ was introduced,\
    \ where 0≤ λ ≤1 as: \n r( w,k|λ) = λlog(φkw)+ (1-λ) log(φkw / pw ), \nλ provides\
    \ the weight for the term w in the topic k. Thus, when λ = 0, the word has \n\
    its own lift; when λ = 1, then it is ranked according to its probability. To define\
    \ an \noptimal weight for λ, the authors did a case study that revealed that the\
    \ optimum \nvalue to find topic-relevant terms is when λ = 0.6. For the purpose\
    \ of this research, \nλ = 0.6 was set as the optimum value as well (Sievert and\
    \ Shirley, 2014). \nIn the present case study while using the model described\
    \ above the number of \niterations was set to 5000 to train the model, because\
    \ LDA is an iterative \nalgorithm, “One iteration equals one round of sampling\
    \ the training data and in one \nsynchronization pass all the model data are synchronized”\
    \ (Zhang et al., 2015, p.\n1). The more iterations are done, the more stable the\
    \ model is. The optimal \nnumber of topics for a small corpus could be selected\
    \ based on the outcomes; for \na larger set of data, it is recommended to use\
    \ a matrix factorization method (Arun \net al., 2010). Big data in this context\
    \ means “a phenomenon defined by the rapid \nacceleration in the expanding volume\
    \ of high velocity, complex, and diverse types \n!89\nof data” (TechAmerica Foundation’s\
    \ Federal Big Data Commission). Since the set \nof data that is used for the current\
    \ case study cannot be described as complex or \nexpanding at high velocity, the\
    \ optimal number of topics will be selected based on \nthe visualized results\
    \ and iterations. To prepare the data for analysis, the following \nsteps were\
    \ taken: 1) all the special signs like “)”, “(” were removed from the \nreviews;\
    \ 2) all the letters were made lower-case; 3) all the numbers in the review \n\
    were removed; 4) all the stop words  and all terms that appear less than 5 times\
    \ \n15\nin the reviews were removed. Additionally the positive and negative reviews\
    \ were \nsorted in accordance with the reviewers’ rating (1 to 5 stars). A positive\
    \ review was \ndefined as a review that received 4 or 5 stars. Negative reviews\
    \ were defined as \nreviews that received 1 or 2 stars. \n5.5.3 Results of the\
    \ case study on the German startup PEAT \nPEAT is a startup company that, according\
    \ to their website, provides “automatic \nimage recognition for plant damage”.\
    \ Currently, the startup has two solutions on \nthe market based on an image recognition\
    \ algorithm developed for plant diseases: \nthe Plantix app and surveillance systems\
    \ for indoor faming and greenhouses. The \npresent investigation was done for\
    \ the marketing strategies of the Plantix app as \none of the first solutions\
    \ brought to the market by the startup. \nThe app works as follows: the users\
    \ of the app can take a picture of a sick plant \nand, through image recognition,\
    \ the diagnosis will be determined and a possible \ncure method will be suggested\
    \ to the user. The farmer can also receive additional \nadvice from the expert\
    \ community who also use the app. \nThe PEAT startup was founded in 2015 in Hannover\
    \ by six co-founders: Simone \nStrey (CEO, who is a geographer specialized in\
    \ geobotany and soil science), \nPierre Munzel (responsible for PR), Alexander\
    \ Kennephol (an expert in plant \ndiseases and one of the developers of the plant\
    \ diseases database), Robert Strey \n15 A stop word represents commonly used words\
    \ such as “the”, “a”, “an”, “in” etc. that are removed \nduring the preparation\
    \ of the text for the analysis. A special package from R which is called tidytext\
    \ \n(package) Stop_words was used to remove stop words. The package includes English\
    \ stop words \nfrom three different lexicons/dictionaries as a data frame. The\
    \ snowball and SMART sets are pulled \nfrom the tm package. Words with non-ASCII\
    \ characters have been removed. The source of the \nstop word was “SMART\".\n\
    !90\n(an expert in machine learning), Bianca Summer (the coordinator of local\
    \ \ncooperations in African countries) and Korbinian Hartberger (responsible for\
    \ \ncommunication) . PEAT started as a project at the Leibniz University, where\
    \ the \n16\nfounders received the German grant “EXIST”. The grant provides funding\
    \ for one \nyear for research and solution development that must later be commercialized.\
    \ \nAccording to the in-depth interview with one of the co-founders, before the\
    \ startup \nwas founded, the founders were already good friends. Three startup\
    \ co-founders \n(Simone, Pierre and Robert) had already previously gathered experience\
    \ as \nfounders of the NGO “Green Desert e.V”, which no longer exists. The NGO\
    \ \ncoordinated several agricultural projects in Ghana and Senegal. According\
    \ to the \nin-depth interview with one of the co-founders Pierre Munzel, during\
    \ this time, they \ndiscovered that African farmers sometimes use toxic and inappropriate\
    \ means to \ncure the plants.  \n“There we had experienced the Eureka moment when\
    \ we got to know local farmers who \nhave learnt a very special way to keep the\
    \ ants away from the lettuce. For this they used \nbattery acid. So they just\
    \ broke the normal battery and dripped the inside of the battery \ndirectly on\
    \ the lettuce. That was the moment when we realized that those farmers need an\
    \ \nelucidation”.- in-depth interview with the co-founder  \nThis experience served\
    \ as an inspiration for the initial idea of the Plantix app. For \nthe development\
    \ of the first version of the app, according to the in-depth interview, \na group\
    \ of approximately 100 friends and acquaintances was created. The first \ntarget\
    \ group using the app were the hobby gardeners. That is why the first version\
    \ \nof the app released in 2015 was called “GartenBank”. In one interview with\
    \ the \nblogger of “Kistengrün“,(a „green“ blog) the co-founder Simone Strey said\
    \ that the \ninitial version of the app could recognize over 90 plant diseases\
    \ (Mel, 2015). The \ndatabase of the images and diseases started as a crowdsourcing-science\
    \ project \nwhere everyone had an opportunity to send an image of a sick plant\
    \ and even \nmark the diseased area. Thus, through the “GartenBank” app, more\
    \ than 6000 \nimages were collected (Mel, 2015). Those images were used to train\
    \ the machine- \nlearning algorithm for plant and disease recognition. \n Information\
    \ provided on the web-site about the founding team\n16\n!91\nIn 2016, the app\
    \ Plantix was released. The target group of this app was not only \nhobby gardeners\
    \ but small horticultural farmers. After Germany, the next country \nwhere the\
    \ app was launched was India, according to the in-depth interview with \nthe co-founder\
    \ Pierre Munzel. Three years later, the Plantix app built a presence in \nGermany,\
    \ Nepal, India and Tunisia. On Google Play, there were more than one \nmillion\
    \ downloads, over sixteen thousand ratings  and more than 3,000 reviews \n17\n\
    5.5.3.1 User’s perception of the Plantix app’s feasible advantages \nTo test the\
    \ first hypothesis about the advantages of the solution, 3,424 reviews in \nEnglish\
    \ and 129 reviews in German from the Google Play Store will be used that \nwere\
    \ submitted before 17 August 2018. The main advantages of the app will be \ndescribed\
    \ according to the information on the startup press kit. Then, the topics of \n\
    the overall review will be presented, as well as the top 30 terms that characterize\
    \ \nit. Then, the positive and negative reviews will be separately analyzed to\
    \ see what \nthe users like the most about the solution, what is still missing\
    \ and if the value that \na startup wants to deliver is correspondingly appreciated\
    \ and understood by the \ntarget group.  \nAccording to the press kit about the\
    \ Plantix app, its aim is to provide: 1) diagnosis \nfor a sick plant; 2) advice\
    \ on its treatment with special focus on biological control \nmechanisms. This\
    \ aims to help farmers improve the harvest, because according to \nthe press kit,\
    \ approximately 30% of the world-wide harvest is damaged by various \nplant diseases.\
    \  \n5.5.3.1.1 User’s perception based on the reviews in English \nAfter cleaning\
    \ the reviews in English, there were 3,421 valid reviews out of 3,424. \n2,851\
    \ reviews were positive and 372 were negative. 198 reviews had 3-star \nratings\
    \ and are as well presented in the table below in “all reviews”.  \n The app has\
    \ only been developed for use with Android devices so far.\n17\n!92\nThere is\
    \ a large discrepancy in the length of the reviews. The minimal length has \n\
    only two characters while the longest has 955. The negative reviews were on \n\
    average longer than the positive ones. However, the longest review was a positive\
    \ \none. \nThe table below presents a comparison of the positive and negative\
    \ reviews and \ntheir length. \nTable 16: Statistical parameters of the review\
    \ length (in characters) in English \nTo select the optimal number of topics that\
    \ could best describe the reviews, a \nvaried number of topics was tested within\
    \ the model: 30, 20, 10 and 5. The model \nwith 5 topics showed plausible results\
    \ concerning content of the reviews. \nThe most frequent topic according to the\
    \ graph below is number 1; the four further \ntopics seem to have similar size.\
    \ The size of the topic corresponds to the \nprevalence in the overall reviews.\
    \ The bigger the topic is, the more frequently it \nappears in the reviews. There\
    \ is also one cluster of three topics that have similarly \nfrequent terms characterizing\
    \ them. The axis in the model does not have certain \ndefinitions but helps to\
    \ visualize the difference/relationship between the topics \nthough the distance\
    \ between them. An example of the topic visualization with the \nLDAvis is presented\

    \ “app, plant, good, \ndisease, crop, identify, problem, recognize, photo” etc.\
    \ The terms that are used in \ntopic 1 represent ca. 33% of the terms (tokens)\

    \ most \ncommonly used terms are “good, great, nice, awesome, helpful”.  \nTopic\
    \ number 2 praises the team who created the app Plantix and their job. \n“agriculture,\

    \ in the app. The following terms are characterized \nby this topic: “language,\
    \ india, hindu, add, kannada, telugu, tamil” – all these are \ndialects in India\
    \ and, apparently, the farmers would like to have the app in those \nlanguages,\
    \ too. \nFigure 17: The top-30 most frequent terms in the overall reviews visualized\

    \ can be seen on the bar \ngraph below; the more often the word is used in the\
    \ reviews, the longer the bar. \nThis means that, in general, most of the reviews\
    \ are positive and that the farmers \nare satisfied with the app and that it apparently\
    \ provides feasible advantages in \nthe recognition of plant diseases, which supports\
    \ hypothesis number one. \n!96\nIn a further step, the positive feedback was analyzed.\
    \ To do so, reviews with 4 or 5 \nstars were filtered. Positive reviews comprised\
    \ approximately 80% of all reviews in \nEnglish. The share of positive reviews\
    \ shows that the users were generally \nsatisfied with the service the app delivered.\
    \ To give the model a concrete shape, \nboth 5 and 10 topics were tested. It was\
    \ determined that 5 topics were best suited \nto summarize the positive reviews.\
    \ \nFigure 18: The most frequent terms found in topic number 1 in the positive\
    \ reviews of the \nPlantix app in English, visualized with LDAvis \nTopic number\
    \ 1 is the largest of the 5 topics and contains 26.5% of tokens \n(terms) from\
    \ the positive reviews; that is why the top 30 terms found there are \n!97\npresented\
    \ above in Figure 18. According to the top 30 most relevant terms in topic \n\
    number 1, the users appreciate the app itself, the idea behind it, the knowledge\
    \ \nthey receive via the app, and the community that helps solve their problems.\
    \ Since \nmost of the customers using the app, according to the analytics platform\
    \ \nsensortower.com, come from India (80%), the term “India” is also one of the\
    \ most \ncommonly used in the reviews. \nTopic number 2 includes the top terms\
    \ about the plant disease identification \nfunction and the language. The proportion\
    \ of tokens in this topic is also more than \n20% in the corpus of positive reviews.\
    \ Topics number 3 and 4 have many \npositive descriptive terms such as “good,\
    \ helpful, amazing and awesome”. In the \ntopic number 3, those adjectives refer\
    \ to the job or work that Plantix does. In the \ntopic number 4, these terms are\
    \ connected to the learning and information that \nfarmers receive through the\
    \ app. Topic number 5 contains many descriptive \npositive terms like “nice, good,\
    \ superb, happy” that refer to the app .  \n18\nAccording to the positive reviews\
    \ analyses in English, the users appreciate the \nmain function of the app that\
    \ helps identify plant diseases, as well as the \nknowledge and community support\
    \ that it additionally provides. \nAlthough the positive reviews represent the\
    \ largest part of the evaluation, there are \nstill 20% of the users that had\
    \ several issues with the app. The negative reviews \nreceived 1 or 2 stars from\
    \ users. After trying different combinations of topics, 3, 4, \n5 and 6 remained.\
    \ The most suitable number of topics for describing the negative \nreviews was\
    \ 6. \nTopics number 1 and 2 contain the terms that were mentioned most frequently\
    \ in \nthe reviews in comparison to the others. There is a cluster of 3 topics,\
    \ including \nthose most often mentioned, which means the negative reviews have\
    \ something in \ncommon. \n The visualised topic-modeling is in Annex 8.5\n18\n\
    !98\nAs the graph below shows, the most frequent terms in topic number 1 concern\
    \ \nnot finding information about the plant or not identifying it correctly. \
    \ \nFigure 19: The most frequent terms in topic number 1 appearing in the negative\
    \ reviews \nof the Plantix app in English visualized with LDAvis \nIn topic number\
    \ 2, the most frequent terms were also about the problems with the \nplant and\
    \ disease identification. Apparently, especially guava and mango were \noften\
    \ not properly recognized by the app. \nIn topic number 3, the users were not\
    \ satisfied with the solution suggested by the \napp. Topic number 4 was about\
    \ language; the Kannada language was mentioned \n!99\nespecially frequently; apparently,\
    \ some of the users understand it better than \nHindu. The terms of topic number\
    \ 5 were just generally describing that the app \nwas not working, and the users\
    \ were feeling that they had wasted their time. And \nfinally, the last topic,\
    \ number 6, concerned problems with the login and sign-in \nprocess.  \nIn line\
    \ with the negative reviews in English, it is possible to conclude that although\
    \ \nthe plant image recognition generally works in most of the cases, the algorithm\
    \ is \nstill not perfect. Some users were extremely frustrated whenever the plant\
    \ was not \nproperly identified. As a result, the solution was also not correctly\
    \ recommended. \nLanguage also plays very important role for the users. There\
    \ is a trend that \nindicates that the Kannada language should be the next to\
    \ be implemented. \nAccording to the majority of the English reviews, the app\
    \ is fulfilling its promises to \nthe users, i.e. identifying the plants’ diseases\
    \ and offering a correct solution. \nHowever, the process is still not working\
    \ perfectly; some users still have problems \nfinding the right diagnosis. The\
    \ most commonly used terms in the reviews were \n“good, awesome, helpful, superb”,\
    \ which positively describes the perceived \nusefulness of the technology. Since\
    \ the present study was focused on Germany, in \nthe following section, the reviews\
    \ in German will also be analyzed and compared \nto the ones in English. \n5.5.3.1.2\
    \ User’s perception based on the reviews in German \nThe statistics of sensortower.com,\
    \ shows that only 3% of the app users are in \nGermany. For the analysis, 129\
    \ reviews in German were identified. To start an \nanalysis of the German reviews,\
    \ the same data cleaning procedure was performed \nas with the reviews in English.\
    \  \nAccording to Table 17 (presented below), the minimal length of a review In\
    \ \nGerman was 4 characters, and the longest review had 640 characters. 86 reviews\
    \ \nwere positive and 33 were negative. The positive reviews were shorter in \n\
    comparison to the negative ones. The average length of the German reviews was\
    \ \n!100\ntwice as long as their English counterparts. However, the longest review\
    \ was given \nin English; it was positive, whereas the longest review in German\
    \ was a negative \none. \nTable 17:Statistical parameters of the review length\
    \ (in characters) in German \nFor the topic-modeling of the reviews in German\
    \ the number of topics was set at 5.  \nThe Top-30 frequent terms in all the reviews\
    \ include the following: \n“pflanzen” (plants), “foto” (photo), “tolle” (great),\
    \ “hilfreich” (helpful), “gut” (good), \n“schnell” (“fast”), “funktioniert” (functions),\
    \ “geht” (in this context, it means that it \nworks), “tipps” (advice), “einfach”\
    \ (easy), “idee” (idea), “garten” (garden), \n“obst” (fruits), “gemuese” (vegetables),\
    \ “gartenbank” (the old name of the Plantx \napp), “erkannt” (identified). There\
    \ are three bigger topics and two smaller ones. \nThere is one topic cluster that\
    \ contains two relatively big topics (topics number 1 \nand 3). \nThe terms that\
    \ characterize these topic-clusters (topics number 1 and 3) describe \nthe functionality\
    \ of the app. The most frequent terms include “works, identifies, \nplants, garden\
    \ vegetables, fruits, easy, good”. In Figure 20 below the most \nfrequent terms\
    \ in topic number 1 are presented which have the highest portion of \nterms in\
    \ the reviews in German. \nParameter\nAll reviews\nPositive reviews\nNegative\

    \ 20: The most frequent terms found in topic number 1 in the reviews of the Plantix\
    \ \napp in German visualized with LDAvis \nIn topic number 2, the most commonly\
    \ used terms are positive adjectives such \nas “good” and “super”, which refer\
    \ to the idea and advice received. Topic number \n4 describes the experience while\
    \ using the app. The main terms are “helpful, fast, \nsuper, thank you, good,\
    \ easy, idea, vegetables”. Topic number 5 is about the \npositive experience of\
    \ taking a picture of a plant with a disease. \nThe next step is to take a precise\
    \ look at the positive and the negative reviews and \nto identify the differences\
    \ regarding app perception.  \n!102\nFor the topic-modeling of the positive reviews,\
    \ the number of the iterations was the \nsame; the number of topics was set to\
    \ 3. The top terms in all reviews were \n“tolle” (great), “pflanzen” (plants),\
    \ “super”, ”hilfreich” (helpful), “gut” (good), \n“einfach” (easy), “klasse” (great),\
    \ “gartenbank” (old name of the plantix app), “idee” \n(idea), “danke” (thank\
    \ you), “funktioniert” (works), “tipps” (advice). Out of the three \ntopics, topic\
    \ number 1 seems to contain the most frequently used terms and has a \nproportion\
    \ of 44.6% of all tokens.  \nThe most relevant terms for that topic address two\
    \ aspects: the idea and advice \nthat the users receive via the app. The adjectives\
    \ most frequently used in this topic \ncharacterize a good experience and the\
    \ appreciation of the app. The relevant \nterms from topic number 2 describe the\
    \ idea of the app as being “helpful, easy, \ngood” and that it “works”. The top\
    \ frequent terms of topic number 3 indicate that \nthe tips provided by the app\
    \ work well and seem to be good. \nFor the negative reviews, the number of the\
    \ topics was also set to three. The top \nfour most frequent terms are “foto”\
    \ (picture), “pflanzen” (plants), “update”, \n“funktioniert” (works) according\
    \ to the graphic below.  \nTopic number 1 is characterized mostly by the terms\
    \ “update” and \n“funktioniert” (works). This could mean that apparently, after\
    \ the app updates, \nsome users have problems with using it. Topics number 2 and\
    \ 3 are mainly \ncharacterized by one term: “picture” regarding the second topic\
    \ and “plants” \nregarding the third topic. These terms indicate that the users\
    \ sometimes have \nproblems with the picture, either with the identification or\
    \ whilst uploading and, \nregarding the third topic, it could mean that the app\
    \ could not recognize the plant. \nThe reviews in German and English both showed\
    \ that most users perceive the \nplant recognition and treatment recommendations\
    \ as helpful and good. This \nmeans that the advantages of the app written in\
    \ the press kit about the Plantix app \nare recognized and positively embraced\
    \ by the users. Although there are still some \nissues with plant recognition,\
    \ and some farmers would like to have certain \nadditional plants in the app,\
    \ the majority of users rated the app positively. The \n!103\nlanguage topic was\
    \ important for the reviewers who wrote in English and used the \napp in India.\
    \ \n5.5.3.2 Trial version, API and development of the Plantix app \nSince the\
    \ app delivers the promised features in the eyes of most users and \nprovides\
    \ a feasible advantage, it is also important to see if it is possible to have\
    \ a \ntrial version of it. Trialability is one of the most important characteristics\
    \ of \ninnovation that supports adoption, according to Rogers (1983). The Plantix\
    \ app is \nfree to download and there are no built-in paid functions.  \nKeeping\
    \ the app free of charge is one of the most important aims, according to the \n\
    co-founder of PEAT, Pierre Munzel. In the in-depth interview, he describes that\
    \ the \napp could be financed in cooperation with international or state organizations,\
    \ e.g. \nthe German Corporation for International Cooperation, or by selling an\
    \ API license \nto agricultural corporations.  \nOne of the important issues the\
    \ EIP-AGRI (2015) suggested in the expert report \nwas the lack of opportunity\
    \ to integrate new precision farming tools into those \nalready existing. This\
    \ aspect of the technology also influences ease of use and \nusefulness. From\
    \ the very beginning, PEAT has developed its software so that it \nwould be possible\
    \ to integrate other systems into it (Start-Green, 2018). On the \none hand, the\
    \ API allows third parties to use the PEAT technology in their \nsoftware; on\
    \ the other hand, it allows PEAT to easily integrate additional functions \nto\
    \ their software.  \nAPI for PEAT also represents an additional business model,\
    \ through which \ncompanies can integrate the functions of the PEAT software for\
    \ a license fee. This \nbusiness model was successful in Germany, where companies\
    \ that produce plant \nprotection remedies became interested in the machine learning\
    \ algorithm for plant \ndisease recognition, according to the in-depth interview.\
    \ Instead of developing \ntheir own algorithm system, the companies pay a license\
    \ fee and, at the same \ntime, also provide photos for new plants in order to\
    \ train the system. Thus, PEAT \n!104\ncan constantly broaden its database of\
    \ plant diseases and, at the same time, their \ntechnology can reach additional\
    \ users without additional marketing costs. \nAccording to the in-depth interview\
    \ with one of PEAT’s co-founders, Pierre Munzel, \nwhile developing their first\
    \ version of the Plantix app (initially called “GartenBank”), \nfriends and acquaintances\
    \ became their early adopters. \n“We invited our friends and acquaintances to\
    \ our beta-group. There was a total of 100 participants \nin the group who tested\
    \ the app and provided us with the feedback about its usability.” - from the in-\n\
    depth interview with the co-founder   \nTo train the image-recognition algorithm,\
    \ PEAT started a crowdsourcing-science \nproject in 2015 that was open to any\
    \ participants and aimed to collect as many \nphotos of the plants as possible,\
    \ as Mel (2015) reports in her blog. The hobby \ngardeners and farmers could use\
    \ the first version of the app not only to find photos \nof plant diseases but\
    \ also to take their own and upload them to the app. Those \nimages were then\
    \ collected, analyzed and categorized. As a result, more than \n6,000 images were\
    \ obtained during this project.  \n5.5.3.3 Target group and cooperation as key\
    \ marketing strategies  \nAccording to Moore (1999), one of the possible ways\
    \ to avoid a chasm on the \nmarket is to concentrate on a niche. One of the possible\
    \ niches on the agricultural \nmarket are large farms. However, for PEAT this\
    \ segment of the market was not a \nmain interest from the very beginning. Instead,\
    \ as a target-group, hobby gardeners \nand small farmers were selected. According\
    \ to the in-depth interview with the co-\nfounder of the Plantix app, especially\
    \ small farmers in developing countries do not \nhave the resources to purchase\
    \ expensive software to monitor their farm but, at \nthe same time, they also\
    \ have a substantial need for solutions to be able to save \ntheir harvest and\
    \ to get expertise which otherwise is not easily available.  \nSo how did PEAT\
    \ manage to grow so quickly in such a complicated segment of \nthe market, while\
    \ often small farmers are not the ones who adopt new technology \nin the first\
    \ place? What kind of marketing strategies did the startup use? First, the \n\
    !105\npartners of the PEAT startup will be looked at. To find an answer to this\
    \ question, \nthe in-depth interview and online articles will be analyzed. \n\
    In 2017, PEAT received several important awards, e.g. the CEBIT Innovation, the\
    \ \nWorld Summit Award (United Nations) in the category Environment and Green\
    \ \nEnergy (WSA, 2016), and the Global Data-Driven Farming Prize by the US \n\
    government’s Feed the Future Initiative (Jackiewicz, 2017). These awards helped\
    \ \nthe startup direct attention to their technology.  \nSince 2016, the founders\
    \ have been looking for strategic partners to launch the \napp in Brazil, India\
    \ and Mali, according to the in-depth interview with a co-founder. \nIn May of\
    \ 2017, PEAT officially launched the Plantix app in India in cooperation \nwith\
    \ International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid tropics (ICRISAT) and\
    \ \nthe Acharya N G Ranga Agricultural University in Vijayawada (ICRISAT, 2017).\
    \ \nICRISAT also has additional regional centers in Mali and Kenya and research\
    \ \nstations in Niger, Nigeria, Malawi, Ethiopia and Zimbabwe. In India, ICRISAT\
    \ has \neven gained special status as a UN Organization. The app was launched\
    \ in two \nlanguages: in Hindu and in the local language, Telugu. ICRISAT organized\
    \ several \nworkshops for the field managers and plant disease experts to test\
    \ and show how \nPlantix works, according to PEAT’s social media platforms. The\
    \ aim of the \ncooperation is to \"build a database of pest and disease images\
    \ and content for its \nsix mandate crops” (ICRISAT, 2017). A special team in\
    \ the ICRISAT- Integrated \nCrop Management supports the startup in collecting\
    \ the relevant plant diseases in \nIndia, as well as solutions for treatment of\
    \ those diseases. \nAnother international project involving the startup is called\
    \ “The Feed the Future \nNepal Seed and Fertilizer” (NSAF). This project is supported\
    \ by the United States \nAgency for International Development in Nepal. The project\
    \ started in April of 2016 \nand will end in March of 2021. The aim of the cooperation\
    \ between PEAT and \nNSAF is, on the one hand, to translate the app into Nepali\
    \ and to adapt it to the \nmajor agro-ecologies of the country; on the other hand,\
    \ it aims to develop a crop \ncalendar app. The app should “integrate all of the\
    \ outputs of the collaborative \nagronomy programs of NSAF and NARC (variety recommendations,\
    \ soil data, \n!106\nfertilizer recommendations, etc.) into an interactive advisory\
    \ guide for \nfarmers” (USAID, 2017, p.6).  \nThe German Corporation for International\
    \ Cooperation (GIZ) also took part in a \njoint project with the startup in 2016.\
    \ The Plantix app was a part of two programs: \n„Promoting Sustainable Agriculture\
    \ and Rural development“ and the „Green \nInnovation Center“ in Tunisia, which\
    \ should help female smallholder farmers to \ngain access to knowledge about plant\
    \ diseases. To achieve this aim, female \nfarmers were provided with smartphones\
    \ and were technically and economically \ntrained to later act as local service\
    \ providers called “plant doctors”, by using the \nPlantix app. For the project,\
    \ 70 participants who had 6 days of training with the \nTunisian plant-experts\
    \ were selected. The Plantix app was then later presented \nand promoted during\
    \ several events, conferences and at one of the largest \nagricultural fairs in\
    \ Africa (GIZ, 2018). \nThe Centre for Agriculture and Bioscience International\
    \ (CABI) is another \ncooperation partner of the PEAT startup. The aim of the\
    \ organization, according to \nits website, is to provide information and scientific\
    \ expertise to solve agricultural \nand environmental problems. This non-profit\
    \ organization partnered with PEAT as \npart of an 18-month study “to assess the\
    \ benefits of a smartphone app called \nPlantix” (CABI, 2018). The partnership\
    \ aims at improving the app’s disease \ndetection ability and integration of biologically\
    \ based pest management. The \nscientists of the MS Swaminathan Research Foundation\
    \ in Tamil Nadu, India, and \nplant doctors will test the app on rice, groundnuts,\
    \ brinjal, chili peppers and \nbananas. \nThese international, non-governmental\
    \ organizations are the main partners of the \nstartup in terms of farmers’ education\
    \ and app promotion. At the same time, these \npartners are customers who help\
    \ develop the app, suggest additional functions \n(like the NSAF cooperation did)\
    \ or improve existing functions by testing them with \nthe farmers and extension\
    \ agents. Moreover, releasing Plantix in a new country \nmeans finding new partners\
    \ and experts who can help introduce new types of \ncrops and diseases that are\
    \ specific to a certain country into the database. Those \npartnerships are essential\
    \ to the startup because in order to include a new crop, a \n!107\ncertain number\
    \ of photos showing possible new diseases are needed to be able to \ntrain the\
    \ algorithm to recognize those diseases shown on the photo. Since the \ndiseases\
    \ are new, in addition to their recognition, new treatments also need to be \n\
    developed. \n5.5.3.4 Mass media as important source of growth \nAnother important\
    \ source of growth for PEAT was the press. When the first version \nof the app\
    \ “GartenBank” was introduced, an article in a local Hannover newspaper \nwas\
    \ promptly published. This article caught the attention of a regional TV channel.\
    \ \nThis TV channel made a video for a popular show called “NDR Markt”. After\
    \ the \nreport about the app was streamed during the show, the number of downloads\
    \ \ngrew exponentially and, according to the in-depth interview with the co-founder,\
    \ \nthe press is still one of the most important sources for growth.  \nTo analyze\
    \ press coverage about the app, all articles about the app and the PEAT \nstartup\
    \ were collected. As a source, Google-Search was used, applying the \nkeywords\
    \ “plantix, peat startup” in German and English. Also, all the articles that \n\
    are mentioned on the startup’s website were used. On 22 August 2018, the \nkeyword\
    \ plantix could be found on 25 pages on Google. Some articles were also \ndisplayed\
    \ in other languages, e.g. French, Russian, etc. These articles were not \nused\
    \ for the analysis.  \n14 Google pages with the keyword “peat startup” were reviewed,\
    \ as on the further \npages there was no information connected to the startup.\
    \ To analyze the content \nof the articles, the LDAvis model was used. To prepare\
    \ the articles for analysis, the \nsame procedure as for the review analysis was\
    \ applied. The number of iterations \nfor the model is 5,000. In total, 48 articles\
    \ in English and 53 in German about \nPEAT and the Plantix app, including the\
    \ Wikipedia description, were analyzed . \n19\nThe articles about PEAT appeared\
    \ in well-established mass media sources that \nhave a significant number of readers\
    \ worldwide, such as Fortune, Wired, Deutsche \nWelle, Euronews, Al Jazeera, BBC.\
    \  \n All articles used for the topic modeling presented in Annex 8.6\n19\n!108\n\
    For the analysis of the articles written in English, the following number of topics\
    \ \nwere tested: 30, 20, 10, 8 and 5. The most suitable number of topics for the\
    \ \ndescription of the articles was 5. Two topics were more frequently mentioned\
    \ in the \narticles than 3 others.  \nTopic number 1 was characterized by such\
    \ terms as “app, plant, peat crop, \ndisease, pests, mobile, based, companies,\
    \ treatment”. This topic could be \ncharacterized as a problem statement that\
    \ the app tries to solve. Such terms as \n“worldwide, countries, brazil, collaboration”\
    \ also appear in this topic. This means \nthat the problem of the plant diseases\
    \ the company wants to solve worldwide and \ncollaboration also play their roles\
    \ in the achievement of this aim. \nTopic number 2 top ten terms are “farmers,\
    \ plantix, agricultural, startup, learning, \nplants, technology, image, Indian,\
    \ identify”. This topic could be described as a \ntechnology description and the\
    \ target group. Apparently, the greatest number of \narticles in English referred\
    \ to the Indian market and the use of the app there. Topic \nnumber 3 had as most\
    \ frequent terms such words as “diseases, india, users, \ngermany, company, nutrient,\
    \ pest, local”. This topic could be described as the \nimportance of Indian users\
    \ for the German company and its solution for fighting \nplant diseases. Topic\
    \ number 4 concerns the technological aspects of the app \nand is characterized\
    \ by such terms as “database, recognition, knowledge, digital, \nsmartphone, ai,\
    \ algorithms, smart”. Topic number 5 could be described as the \nrole of this\
    \ technology in environmental control for farmers.  \nAmong the top terms are\
    \ “information, pictures, developed, data, technologies, \nfarmer, picture, food,\
    \ environmental, control, detection”. Below in Figure 21 the 30 \nmost frequent\
    \ terms in all the articles in English are shown. \n!109\nFigure 21: The most\
    \ frequent terms used in the articles in English visualized with LDAvis \nFor\
    \ the analysis of the articles in German, the number of topics was set first to\
    \ 15, \nthen to 10, 7,5 and 3. The most suitable number of topics for the description\
    \ was \n3. The top ten most used terms in German articles were “plantix, peat,\
    \ software, \npflanzen (plants), krankheiten (diseases), erkennen (identify),\
    \ pflanzenkrankheiten \n(plant diseases), nutzer (users) weltweit (all around\
    \ the world), bauern (farmers)”. \nThe graph below shows the most frequent terms\
    \ in the German articles. \n!110\nFigure 22: The most frequent terms used in articles\
    \ in German visualized with LDAvis \nAmong the three topics identified in the\
    \ German articles, topic number 1 could be \ndescribed as an innovative solution\
    \ for the farmers. The most frequently used \nterms in this topic are nearly the\
    \ same as those listed above except new ones like \naward, innovation and cebit.\
    \ Apparently some of the articles in German were \nwritten about the CeBIT award\
    \ for innovative technologies, which the startup \nreceived in 2016. Topic number\
    \ 2 refers to the internationalization of plant \ndisease recognition technology\
    \ and the possibility to use it worldwide, especially in \nBrazil. Among the top\
    \ 15 terms in this topic are „weltweit“ (worldwide), \n„schaedlinge“ (pests),\
    \ „brasilien“ (Brazil). \nTopic number 3 has a focus on another country - the\
    \ role of the founders of the \napp for Indian farmers. This topic is a combination\
    \ of the terms referring to some \nspecial features of the technology such as\
    \ algorithms, diagnosis, and treatment, \nwhich are the core functions of the\
    \ app. Apparently in some articles there was \n!111\nmore information about the\
    \ founders and the idea generally, which is why there are \nsuch frequent terms\
    \ as Hanover, the city where the startup was founded; team, \nfounders (in German\
    \ “greunder”), idea (in German “idee”). \nAccording to the topic-modeling presented\
    \ above, the articles in English about the \napp were more concentrated on the\
    \ description of the value and technological \naspects of the app, as well as\
    \ the impact it might have on the farmers and its \nmarketing strategy to expand\
    \ through collaboration. The geographical articles in \nEnglish referred to three\
    \ countries: Germany, India and Brazil.  \nIn the German articles, in addition\
    \ to the technological aspects of the app and its \ntarget group, the technology\
    \ was described as a distinctive innovation. Brazil as \nanother important country\
    \ for this technology where the idea of it was born was \nalso mentioned. The\
    \ German articles also paid more attention to the founding \nteam, confirmed by\
    \ such frequent terms as the founding city “Hanover”, “founder”, \n“team”, “idea”.\
    \ Another trigger in the German press for the articles was an \ninnovative award\
    \ granted to PEAT by the CeBit technology trade fair. In general \nthe press articles\
    \ described the benefits of the app, which could serve as a trigger \nfor the\
    \ decision to adopt. \nThe present case study revealed the special role that international\
    \ organizations \nplay in the marketing strategy of the startup PEAT. They enable\
    \ a startup to enter \nnew markets by providing the necessary data about the plants\
    \ and treatments, \ntraining for the farmers and sometimes even financial resources\
    \ for the \ndevelopment of new features. The CeBit award provided this startup\
    \ with the \nnecessary attention to their innovative technology and through this\
    \ award provided \nPEAT with the first interested agricultural corporations, as\
    \ well as some \ninternational cooperation partners. The press coverage also helped\
    \ to find new \nusers, as well as gain more trust in the eyes of the potential\
    \ cooperation partners. \nAccording to the reviews of the Plantix app the users\
    \ were satisfied with its \nservices. The most mentioned topic in German and in\
    \ English was the recognition \nof certain plants and plant diseases. In English\
    \ reviews the language was also \nimportant and there is a trend that indicates\
    \ that the Kannada language could be \nthe next to be implemented.\P\n!112\n6\
    \ Conclusion \nMake the feeding of the livestock healthier, reduce feed costs\
    \ and improve feed \nefficiency; save money on more efficient crop protection\
    \ and reduce overall use of \npesticides; recover up to 30% of the harvest due\
    \ to intelligent plant disease \nanalysis: these are examples of the objectives\
    \ that new agricultural startups want \nto achieve using such technologies as\
    \ artificial intelligence, the Internet, sensors, \netc. Reaching these objectives\
    \ and distributing these technologies among farmers \nplays an important role\
    \ in the increase of food production and its quality, which \nmust be achieved\
    \ by 2050, according to the Food and Agricultural Organization \n(FAO, 2009).\
    \  \nHowever, according to the expert focus group EIP-AGRI (2015), the process\
    \ of the \ndiffusion of these innovations in the European countries is much slower\
    \ than \nexpected. Therefore, the purpose of this investigative work was to discover\
    \ what \nkinds of obstacles exist on the market, and what strategies agricultural\
    \ startups \napply to overcome them to be able to achieve critical mass on the\
    \ market. To \nidentify the marketing strategies for the achievement of critical\
    \ mass, two \nqualitative inquiries (in-depth interviews and a case study) were\
    \ conducted. The \nresults of those two inquiries provided certain insights that\
    \ might be helpful for \nstartups on the way to achievement of critical mass.\
    \ In addition to simply giving \nsome practical advice, the research presented\
    \ here could provide insights which \nmight lead to a theoretical adjustment of\
    \ the channels that could be used to \nachieve critical mass on the market where\
    \ a chasm exists. \n6.1 Recommendations for agricultural startups to achieve critical\
    \ mass \nThe qualitative investigation of various types of agricultural startups\
    \ helped to \nreveal seven common strategies that startups with critical mass\
    \ were following. It \nis possible to divide the strategies discovered through\
    \ the interviews and the case \nstudy into two major categories: technological\
    \ aspects that a service or a product \nshould have and specific channels that\
    \ worked the best to attract early adopters \nwithin a short time. The table below\
    \ provides an overview of those strategies. \nThese strategies are not a recipe\
    \ for success, but they were something most of \n!113\nthe startups interviewed\
    \ had in common and could be considered as a \nrecommendation or a basis that\
    \ might be helpful to achieve continued growth.  \nTable 18: Marketing strategies\
    \ of the startups with critical mass \nThe technological aspects mentioned here\
    \ aim at the product itself and certain \ncharacteristics connected with it, such\
    \ as feasible advantage. The role of each of \nthe four aspects -- feasible technological\
    \ advantage, joint product development, \ntrial version and API – is different\
    \ during the initial phase of development. Some \nstartups started with one idea\
    \ of the product and developed a first version to \nprovide a trial opportunity\
    \ to the first users. This enabled them to discover \ntechnical bugs and at the\
    \ same time better understand if the product or service \nprovided enough value\
    \ and if not, to adjust it as soon as possible. Some startups \nstarted with their\
    \ own observations of the work process on the farms and \ninterviewed the farmers\
    \ before they developed their first version of a product/\nservice. Others collaborated\
    \ with the farmers in order to create a better user \nexperience. But independent\
    \ of the time when the joint development took place or \na trial version was presented,\
    \ in the end, the only thing that counted from the \nperspective of the farmer\
    \ was the real feasible technological advantage of \nadopting a product/service.\
    \ In any case, startups with critical mass used both joint \nproduct development\
    \ and trial versions as strategies to find feasible advantages to \noffer to the\
    \ farmers. Development of the API often took place at the end of the \nproduct\
    \ testing phase and served as a bridge for further growth in cooperation with\
    \ \nother existing services on the market.  \nCustomer channel strategies represent\
    \ the most useful means of communication \nto find and to win over early adopters.\
    \ All startups with critical mass used mass \nmedia actively and could gain significant\
    \ growth through specific newspapers or \nTV programs within a short time. However,\
    \ the growth was not sustainable. The \nTechnological aspects\nCustomer channels\n\
    feasible technological advantage\nmass media\njoint product development\ncooperation\
    \ for educational purposes\ntrial version\ncooperation for distribution purposes\n\
    API\n!114\nmost efficient and sustainable growth channel which most of the startups\
    \ aim to \nachieve is word-of-mouth. The difficulty of this channel is that it\
    \ requires trust and \npersonal communication that is difficult to achieve en\
    \ masse due to the limited \nbudgets of the startups. To overcome both of these\
    \ barriers, startups with critical \nmass found partners who had already gained\
    \ trust from farmers and who usually \ncommunicate with them at regular intervals.\
    \ In the case of the startups \ninvestigated, such partners were either distributors\
    \ or NGOs that work actively with \nfarmers. \nRecognition of the technology potential\
    \ of the Berlin startup PEAT by the United \nNations helped them to build international\
    \ cooperations with agricultural \ninstitutions in other countries. The Indonesian\
    \ president’s personal interest in \nagricultural technologies influenced the\
    \ growth rate of one of the startups \ninterviewed. These examples reveal the\
    \ positive role that trusted governmental \ninstitutions could play in the process\
    \ of gaining sustainable attention on the market \nthat most startups lack, as\
    \ they are relatively unknown. Educational programs for \nthe farmers where startups\
    \ could test their technologies together with the target \ngroup could help to\
    \ spur the adoption rate of the most important solutions in the \nsector. According\
    \ to the interviews, in some countries, e,g, India, such educational \nroles are\
    \ either fulfilled by NGOs or other research institutions. Often such \neducational\
    \ programs are financially supported either by the government or by \nsuch international\
    \ organizations as the United Nations, GIZ or USAID. Such joint \nprograms could\
    \ play an important role for the startups which are developing \nsolutions for\
    \ the markets with chasms due to the technological knowledge gap \nbetween early\
    \ adopters and the early majority. \n6.2 Implications for the diffusion of innovation\
    \ theory and further research \nIn the diffusion of innovation theory, the phenomenon\
    \ of innovation adoption is \ndefined as a process where information about innovation\
    \ is communicated or \ndiffuses through a social system (Rogers, 1983). Communication\
    \ of information \nabout new technology provides knowledge about innovation and\
    \ reduces \nuncertainty about its benefits and risks (Rogers, 1983). The communication\
    \ \n!115\nprocess generally takes place through two main channels: mass media\
    \ and \ninterpersonal channels. According to Mahajan et al. (1990), before critical\
    \ mass is \nachieved, the main communication channel is mass media. As soon as\
    \ critical \nmass has been achieved, the role of mass media in the further diffusion\
    \ process \ndecreases and interpersonal communication increases. \nHowever, what\
    \ happens if there is a gap between the early adopters and early \nmajority on\
    \ the market? Which channels should be used to allow further growth? \nAccording\
    \ to the results of the in-depth interviews and the case study, the \nrelevance\
    \ of interpersonal channels in this situation increases before critical mass \n\
    is reached.  \nAccording to the in-depth interviews, one of the main obstacles\
    \ on the market that \nstartups and farmers identified was a lack of demonstrability\
    \ regarding the new \ndigital technologies and their impact on the farming process.\
    \ As a result, the most \neffective channel for customer acquisition for all the\
    \ startups that participated in \nthe in-depth interview was direct contact. Some\
    \ startups could observe that, after \nthey visited one or several farmers in\
    \ certain regions, the farms in the \nneighborhood started using their technology\
    \ after a short time. Cold calling was \nalso one of the most frequently used\
    \ methods among the online marketplaces at \nthe beginning according to the telephone\
    \ interviews. \nThe case study showed that the market entrance for PEAT in India\
    \ and further \ndeveloping countries was possible only due to numerous cooperations.\
    \ In the \ncourse of those cooperations, several workshops were organized to teach\
    \ change \nagents or selected farmers about the use of the technology. According\
    \ to the \napplication’s website reviews, the workshop participants began using\
    \ the PEAT \nsolution and working as disseminators for other farmers. \nThese\
    \ insights from the qualitative investigations indicate that startups have \n\
    recognized that the best channel for sustainable technology adoption in the \n\
    farming sector is interpersonal contact. This observation was made by all startups\
    \ \ninterviewed, including those that have not reached critical mass. This contradicts\
    \ \n!116\nthe general theory, which claims that the role of mass media should\
    \ be the best \nsuited channel for achievement of critical mass at first, and\
    \ then only with the \nachievement of critical mass the role of word-of-mouth\
    \ increases. The theory, \nhowever, does not specifically consider markets with\
    \ chasms between early \nadopters and the early majority. It is important for\
    \ further application of this theory \nto investigate if the interpersonal channel\
    \ has a greater impact on adoption before \nachievement of critical mass only\
    \ on the markets with chasms or if this theory \nshould be reconsidered in general.\
    \  \nDue to the relative newness of the agritech sector there is still only a\
    \ small number \nof startups developing certain technologies, which is why the\
    \ main investigative \nmethod was qualitative. Nevertheless, the sector shows\
    \ impressive growth rates \nattracting more and more entrepreneurs. As a result\
    \ it could be interesting for \nfurther research to test the hypotheses developed\
    \ here quantitatively. The \nadvantage of a further quantitive investigation is\
    \ the estimation of the exact impact \nof each type of strategy on the startup’s\
    \ growth, which is hard to define using the \nqualitative method. Therefore, one\
    \ can discover the strategy combinations that \nmake most sense for startups.\
    \ This could be one of the possible directions for \nfurther research. \nAnother\
    \ interesting research direction could be a detailed investigation of different\
    \ \ntypes of partnership that can take different forms and involve different types\
    \ of \nplayers and their impact on growth. Some studies have already done this\
    \ for \nvarious industries. It would be interesting to find out what types of\
    \ partnerships \nplay a crucial role for technology diffusion in the agricultural\
    \ sector. \nA further promising area of research is an investigation of the communication\
    \ \nchannels on the markets where the chasm between early adopters and the early\
    \ \nmajority exists. If the assumption that interpersonal channels are pivotal\
    \ for the \ndiffusion of innovation could be supported by the quantitative data,\
    \ then it could \nprovide an essential insight for all the companies that work\
    \ on such markets and \nwish to develop new products. Moreover, the existence\
    \ of the chasm on the \nagricultural market was only indirectly confirmed by the\
    \ studies about innovation \nadopters and the results of the in-depth interview.\
    \ The quantitative investigation of \n!117\nthe exact factors influencing the\
    \ chasm on the agricultural market could also be \nhelpful in optimizing marketing\
    \ strategies for companies which are considering \nlaunching a new technology\
    \ and improving the product according to the needs of \nthe early majority.\P\n\
    !118\n7 Summary \nAccording to the report of the Food and Agriculture Organization\
    \ of the United \nNations, due to population growth, food production must increase\
    \ by 70% by 2050 \nto meet rising demand (FAO, 2009). Digital agricultural startups\
    \ are one of the \nmain players on the market who develop innovations which should\
    \ assist in \naccomplishing this task. However, most of the startups fail during\
    \ first three years \nwithout achieving critical mass. To understand what kind\
    \ of obstacles exist on the \nmarket and what marketing strategies might help\
    \ in overcoming them, 11 in-depth \ninterviews with international digital startups\
    \ from developed and developing \ncountries were conducted. The results of the\
    \ interviews were verified with help of \ndata triangulation. A low frequency\
    \ of IT use, a lack of software compatibility and \nresult demonstrability, as\
    \ well as a general lack of trust due to the newness of the \ncompany were the\
    \ main challenges that the startups interviewed faced. To \novercome the technological\
    \ issues, startups involved potential customers in the \ndevelopmental phase.\
    \ To demonstrate the results of the solution and win the \nfarmers' trust, startups\
    \ sought direct contact to the farmers via fairs or other types \nof events. Some\
    \ startups used cooperation for educational and distributional aims \nto increase\
    \ the interpersonal communication and to improve their reputation \namong farmers.\
    \ \nIn the next step, the results of the in-depth interviews combined with the\
    \ theory \nabout the innovation acceptance and the expert opinion of EIP-AGRI\
    \ (2015) were \nturned into hypotheses about the marketing strategies that lead\
    \ to achievement of \ncritical mass on the agricultural market. To verify the\
    \ hypotheses, German farm \nmanagement information system startups were selected.\
    \ According to the \nGartner’s Hype Cycle, farm management information systems\
    \ are a mature form \nof technology that could be adopted by the mainstream market.\
    \ Moreover, this \ntype of technology is one element of precision farming that\
    \ is actively promoted in \nthe EU (EIP-AGRI, 2015). However, the diffusion of\
    \ this innovation is lagging, so \nthe importance of finding a way to achieve\
    \ critical mass could be essential for \nfurther adoption. Since only 10 existing\
    \ farm management startups matched the \nselection criteria and only 7 of them\
    \ agreed to participate in the research, a \ntelephone interview based on a structural\
    \ questionnaire was carried out. The \n!119\nmarketing strategies from the telephone\
    \ interviews were triangulated with the \nmarketing strategies of 9 German online\
    \ marketplaces. Both the online \nmarketplaces and the farm management information\
    \ systems improve the value \nchain in the agricultural field and both technologies\
    \ use wireless connections to \nfulfill their functions. According to the results,\
    \ all the companies with critical mass \ntook the technical aspects of the technology\
    \ seriously and offered feasible \nadvantages, trial versions, the possibility\
    \ of the integration of their functions into \nother products or data sharing,\
    \ as well as joint testing of their solution with \nfarmers. The use of mass media\
    \ as a relevant communication channel is also \nsomething common to all the companies.\
    \ Cooperation for distributional purposes \nwas a strategy that the majority of\
    \ the companies with critical mass followed. \nAmong the farm management information\
    \ system startups, PEAT had an \nextraordinary growth rate, not only in Germany\
    \ but also in India, Nepal and in \nTunisia. To explore what kinds of strategies\
    \ contributed to such growth, a case \nstudy about this startup was conducted.\
    \ The case study revealed a special role \nthat international organizations play\
    \ in the growth strategy of the PEAT startup. \nThey enable a startup to enter\
    \ new markets by providing the necessary data about \nplant diseases and their\
    \ treatment, training for the farmers and sometimes even \nfinancial resources\
    \ for the development of new features. The CeBit award \nprovided this startup\
    \ with the necessary attention to the technology that they had \ndeveloped and\
    \ thus provided it with the first agricultural corporations interested in \ntheir\
    \ products/applications, as well as with some international cooperation \npartners.\
    \ \nThe results of the qualitative investigation into the marketing strategies\
    \ of digital \nagricultural startups demonstrated an important role of the technological\
    \ aspects \nsuch as API and usability of innovation, as well as interpersonal\
    \ communication for \nthe achievement of critical mass. Since the number of startups\
    \ selected for the \nresearch presented here was small, it would be interesting\
    \ to verify the results \nobtained with a larger number of startups when the opportunity\
    \ occurs.\P\n!120\n8 Literature \nAgFunder (2017): AgriFood Tech Investing Report.\

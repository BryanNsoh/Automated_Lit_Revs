    \ agriculture. However, political will, policy \ncoherence, and institutional\
    \ capacity can vary across countries and regions. \nStrengthening policy frameworks,\
    \ enhancing coordination among stakeholders, and \npromoting favorable regulations\
    \ and incentives are necessary to overcome these \nchallenges. Consumer behavior\
    \ and market demand: Consumer awareness and \ndemand for sustainably produced\
    \ food products play a crucial role in driving the \nadoption of sustainable agricultural\
    \ practices. However, changing consumer \nbehavior and preferences can be challenging.\
    \ Raising awareness, promoting \nsustainable consumption patterns, and creating\
    \ market incentives for sustainable \nproducts are necessary to drive demand and\
    \ support sustainable agriculture. \n          Addressing these challenges requires\
    \ a multi-dimensional approach that \ninvolves collaborations among governments,\
    \ farmers, researchers, civil society \norganizations, and the private sector.\
    \ Investing in research and development, \nknowledge dissemination, capacity building,\
    \ and creating enabling policy \nenvironments are crucial steps towards overcoming\
    \ these challenges and achieving \nsustainable agricultural development. \nObstacles\
    \ to future prospects for sustainable agricultural development. \n      Several\
    \ obstacles can impede the future prospects for sustainable agricultural \ndevelopment.\
    \ These obstacles pose challenges to the widespread adoption and \nimplementation\
    \ of sustainable practices. Economic viability: The economic viability \nof sustainable\
    \ agriculture can be a significant obstacle. In some cases, the initial \ncosts\
    \ of transitioning to sustainable practices, such as investing in new technologies\
    \ \nor changing production systems, can be high. Farmers may face financial constraints\
    \ \nand perceive short-term economic risks, which can discourage them from adopting\
    \ \nsustainable practices. Ensuring that sustainable agriculture is economically\
    \ viable \nand providing financial incentives and support mechanisms can help\
    \ overcome this \nobstacle. \n       Lack of awareness and knowledge: Limited\

    \ The use of LED lighting, for instance, \nhas significantly reduced energy consumption\
    \ compared to traditional lighting \nsystems. Additionally, renewable energy sources,\
    \ such as solar panels, can be \nintegrated to power indoor farming facilities,\
    \ further enhancing their sustainability. \nLocalization and food miles reduction:\
    \  \n     Vertical farming and indoor farming can be established in urban or peri-urban\
    \ \nareas, bringing food production closer to consumers. This localization reduces\
    \ the \ndistance food needs to travel, thereby minimizing carbon emissions associated\
    \ with \ntransportation and reducing the reliance on long supply chains. By promoting\
    \ local \nfood production, these methods support the development of resilient\
    \ and sustainable \nfood systems. \nInnovation and technological advancements:\
    \ Vertical farming and indoor farming \nare areas of active innovation and technological\
    \ advancements. Research and \ndevelopment efforts are focused on improving energy\
    \ efficiency, optimizing plant \ngrowth systems, developing new crop varieties,\
    \ and advancing automation and \nrobotics. Continued innovation in these areas\
    \ holds the potential to further enhance \nthe sustainability, productivity, and\
    \ economic viability of vertical farming and \nindoor farming. \nHowever, it is\
    \ important to note that challenges exist, such as the high initial \ninvestment\
    \ costs, energy requirements, and the need for skilled technical expertise. \n\
    Overcoming these challenges will require further advancements in technology, \n\

    \ in agriculture and future prospects for sustainable \nagricultural development.\
    \ \n       The concept of a circular economy in agriculture involves designing\
    \ agricultural \nsystems that minimize waste, maximize resource efficiency, and\
    \ promote \nsustainable production and consumption patterns. It aims to create\
    \ a closed-loop \nsystem where waste materials and by-products are recycled, reused,\
    \ or regenerated, \nreducing the dependency on finite resources and minimizing\
    \ environmental impacts. \nHere are some reasons why the circular economy in agriculture\
    \ has future prospects \nfor sustainable agricultural development: \n       Resource\
    \ efficiency: The circular economy in agriculture focuses on optimizing \nresource\
    \ use and reducing waste. It encourages practices such as organic waste \nrecycling,\
    \ composting, and the use of by-products as inputs for other agricultural \nprocesses.\
    \ By closing the loop and reintegrating waste back into the production \nsystem,\
    \ the circular economy minimizes the need for external inputs, conserves \nresources,\
    \ and reduces the environmental footprint of agricultural activities. \n     \
    \     Nutrient cycling and soil health: Circular economy principles emphasize\
    \ the \nrecycling of nutrients to maintain soil fertility and enhance soil health.\
    \ Nutrient-rich \norganic waste, such as crop residues, livestock manure, and\
    \ food waste, can be \ncomposted or converted into biofertilizers to replenish\
    \ soil nutrients. This reduces \nthe reliance on synthetic fertilizers, mitigates\
    \ nutrient pollution in water bodies, and \nsupports sustainable soil management\
    \ practices. Energy generation and renewable \nresources: The circular economy\
    \ in agriculture promotes the use of renewable \nenergy sources and the generation\
    \ of energy from agricultural by-products. For \nexample, bioenergy production\
    \ from crop residues or biogas generation from \nlivestock manure can provide\
    \ clean energy for on-farm operations or be fed into the \nenergy grid. This reduces\
    \ reliance on fossil fuels, contributes to greenhouse gas \nemissions reduction,\
    \ and fosters sustainable energy practices. \nINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN\

    \ optimizing water use and minimizing runoff, the circular economy \nsupports\
    \ sustainable water management, especially in water-scarce regions, \nreducing\
    \ pressure on freshwater resources and improving water efficiency in \nagriculture.\
    \ Value addition and diversification: The circular economy encourages \nvalue\
    \ addition and diversification of agricultural products and by-products. By \n\
    exploring new markets and innovative uses for agricultural waste, farmers can\
    \ \ngenerate additional income streams and reduce waste disposal costs. For instance,\
    \ \nagricultural residues can be used for the production of biofuels, bioplastics,\
    \ or animal \nfeed, contributing to a more sustainable and economically viable\
    \ agricultural sector. \n        Collaboration and partnerships: The circular\
    \ economy in agriculture requires \ncollaboration and partnerships among different\
    \ stakeholders, including farmers, \nbusinesses, policymakers, and consumers.\

    \ \nSuccessful experiences about future prospects for sustainable agricultural\
    \ \ndevelopment. \n       There are several successful experiences and case studies\
    \ that highlight the \nfuture prospects for sustainable agricultural development.\
    \ SRI (System of Rice \nIntensification): SRI is an innovative approach to rice\
    \ cultivation that promotes \nsustainable practices such as reduced water usage,\
    \ organic fertilization, and \nimproved plant spacing. Studies have shown that\
    \ SRI can significantly increase rice \nyields while reducing water consumption\
    \ and chemical inputs. This method has been \nsuccessfully implemented in various\
    \ countries, including India, Madagascar, and \nVietnam, leading to improved productivity\
    \ and resource efficiency. \n        Organic farming and certification: Organic\
    \ farming practices, which avoid \nsynthetic fertilizers and pesticides, have\
    \ gained popularity worldwide. Many \ncountries have implemented organic certification\
    \ systems that ensure the production \nand marketing of organic products. Success\
    \ stories can be found in regions such as \nEurope, where organic farming has\
    \ become a significant agricultural sector, \nproviding consumers with sustainable\
    \ and environmentally friendly food choices. \n       Conservation agriculture:\
    \ Conservation agriculture is an approach that \nemphasizes minimal soil disturbance,\
    \ permanent soil cover, and crop rotation. This \npractice helps improve soil\
    \ health, reduce erosion, and conserve water. Successful \nexperiences of conservation\
    \ agriculture can be found in countries like Brazil, where \nthe adoption of no-till\
    \ farming systems has led to increased crop yields, improved \nsoil fertility,\
    \ and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. \n         Agroforestry systems: Agroforestry\
    \ combines trees with agricultural crops or \nlivestock production, creating diverse\
    \ and sustainable farming systems. This \napproach provides multiple benefits,\
    \ including soil conservation, carbon \nINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN AGRICULTURE\

    \ enhancing ecosystem services. \n       Farmer-led innovations and knowledge\
    \ sharing: Many successful experiences \nin sustainable agricultural development\
    \ come from farmers themselves. Farmers' \ninnovations and knowledge sharing networks\
    \ have played a crucial role in promoting \nsustainable practices. Examples include\
    \ farmer field schools, community seed \nbanks, and farmer cooperatives, where\
    \ farmers exchange ideas, learn from each \nother, and implement sustainable agricultural\
    \ techniques. Public-private \npartnerships: Collaboration between public and\
    \ private sectors has contributed to \nsuccessful sustainable agricultural development.\
    \ These partnerships Facilitate the \ntransfer of knowledge, technology, and financial\
    \ resources to farmers. Initiatives \nsuch as public-private partnerships for\
    \ climate-smart agriculture, market access \nprograms, and corporate sustainability\
    \ commitments have helped farmers adopt \nsustainable practices, improve productivity,\
    \ and access fair markets. \n      These are just a few examples of successful\
    \ experiences in sustainable \nagricultural development. There are numerous other\
    \ cases and initiatives worldwide \nthat demonstrate the potential for sustainable\
    \ practices to enhance food security, \nlivelihoods, and environmental stewardship.\

    \             10.18805/ajdfr.R-2183\nABSTRACT\nIndia became independent in 1947,\
    \ when it was still reeling from the impact of the 1943 Bengal famine and world\
    \ as a whole was\nexperiencing the brunt of world war second. Thus India was born\
    \ hungry in a hungry world. The country leaders were well aware of the\nchallenge\
    \ that India was expected to face in terms of food security and it was Jawaharlal\
    \ Nehru who said everything can wait but not\nagriculture. The first president\
    \ of India Rajendra Prasad after taking the chair, the first thing he did was\
    \ to hoist the flag at the Indian\nCouncil of Agricultural Research, declaring\
    \ “India’s most pressing task would be to conquer the battle of hunger. The Indian\
    \ population\nhas increased tremendously from 376 million in 1950 to 1380 million\
    \ in 2020 and it is agriculture and its allied sectors that sustained\nsuch a\
    \ huge population. India still has a significant proportion of population 14%\
    \ undernourished, 35% children stunted, 20% children\nunderweight, 52% women of\
    \ reproductive age anaemic. India could bring out green revolution, white revolution\
    \ and blue revolution in\norder to provide food security to its people. India\
    \ presently is not food deficient; it has attained self sufficiency in food production\
    \ and\nstands exporters of food. However the irony is that India stands at place\
    \ 102 in global hunger index with score of 30 that is a matter of\nconcern (Global\
    \ Hunger Index-GHI, 2019). The problem is in making this food available to the\
    \ people or access to the food is ensured.\nIndia needs nutritional security rather\
    \ than food security besides transformation in agriculture and allied sectors\
    \ to become free from\nhunger. The task is tough and precipitated by Covid-19\
    \ pandemic, but not impossible. India has much strength but will need research,\n\
    extension, implementation and policy framing to have sustainable, nutrition sensitive,\
    \ climate resilient, integrated and smart agriculture\nto eliminate hunger.\n\
    Key words: Food safety and security, Hunger, Indian agriculture, Malnourishment,\
    \ Nutritional security, Nutrition sensitive agriculture,\n             Smart farming,\
    \ Sustainable agriculture.\nIndia was born hungry\nIndependent India was born\
    \ hungry in hungry world on 15th\nAugust, 1947. On its birth India was still reeling\
    \ from the\nimpact of the 1943 Bengal famine that left 3-4 million people\ndead\
    \ (Maharatna 1996). Globally the scenario was not too\ndifferent, the world was\
    \ yet feeling the jerks of world war\nsecond that resulted into 39 million deaths\
    \ in Europe alone\nand periods of hunger became more common even in\nrelatively\
    \ prosperous Western Europe. A severe hunger crisis\nwas witnessed in Greece,\
    \ Netherlands, Dutch, and  Germany\nduring World War II. Impacts of hunger were\
    \ not restricted to\nthe people living in that era but extended to the individuals\n\
    exposed to hunger crisis in utero. Thus when India became\nfree from the British\
    \ occupation in 1947, the whole world was\nsuffering from one or the other form\
    \ of hunger.\nIn India hunger lay at the roots of much of its public\npolicy in\
    \ its early years and over 70 years later, we are still\na hungry nation. The\
    \ nature may have shifted a bit with no\nmajor famines now but malnourishment\
    \ remains the real\nthreat today too. India is still struggling to feed its people\n\
    adequately, according to the UN, India is a home to quarter\nof the world’s undernourished\
    \ population. Indian leaders and\nthink tanks were aware of the fact that they\
    \ are going to\nface tremendous challenge of hunger in coming days after\nfreedom.\
    \ It was K.A Abbas’s 1946 film Dharti Ke Lal, one of\nthe first Indian social-realist\
    \ films, which spread the message\nof hunger being a big challenge ahead. The\
    \ interim\ngovernment led by Jawaharlal Nehru, which took power in\nSeptember\
    \ 1946, realising the hunger challenge, selected\nDr. Rajendra Prasad “President\
    \ of the Constituent Assembly”\nand the first thing Dr. Prasad did was to raise\
    \ the flag at the\nIndian Council of Agricultural Research, declaring “India’s\
    \ top\nconcern would be to conquer the battle of hunger. Dr. Prasad\nwas made\
    \ in-charge of food and agriculture on January 26,\n1950. Therefore independent\
    \ India from the inception of its\nbirth started working towards the food security\
    \ of its people.\nIndependence to India deprived it of wheat and rice\nbecause\
    \ a large area of Punjab and Bengal got severed\nfrom it. India had to import\
    \ food from as far as Argentina\nimmediately after independence to feed its people\
    \ whose\nstaple food use to be rice and wheat (Fig 1). Prime Minister\nFaculty\

    \ A Review\nJawaharlal Nehru took pains to tell his fellow Indians that\nliving\
    \ on rotis made from a mix of wheat and sweet potatoes\nand reducing consumption\
    \ of food can be observed as he\nobserved himself in lieu of food insufficiency.\
    \ Mahatma\nGandhi fervently advocated the removal of all controls on\nfood, allowing\
    \ a total free market to make food available to\nits people after independence.\
    \ However, the then\nGovernment, imposed the system of ration cards that we\n\
    still follow. This intervention was with good intentions of\nreaching to people\
    \ with food, making food available at a\n‘fair price’ so that access to food gets\
    \ improved and to keep\na check on the speculative tendencies in the market, Public\n\
    Distribution System (PDS) was launched by India. Creation\nof Food Corporation\
    \ of India and Agricultural Prices\nCommission in 1965 consolidated the position\
    \ of PDS. It\nmade government to announce a minimum support price\nfor wheat and\
    \ paddy and procurement of quantities that could\nnot fetch even such minimum\
    \ prices in the market. The\nresultant stocks were to be utilized for maintaining\n\
    distribution through the PDS and a portion of these were\nused to create and maintain\
    \ buffer stocks. However,\nunfortunately bringing in minimum support prices and\n\
    purchases by government corporations resulted in our\ncurrent situation where\
    \ huge amount of grains is languishing\nin government warehouses, while consumers\
    \ still go\nwanting. Similarly the land redistribution to the farmers has\nbeen\
    \ part of India’s state policy from the very beginning\n(Thorner, 1976). Independent\
    \ India’s most revolutionary land\npolicy was perhaps the abolition of the Zamindari\
    \ system.\nSince independence there has been voluntary and state-\ninitiated land\
    \ reforms in several states like West Bengal,\nKerala and J&K with dual objective\
    \ of efficient use of\nland and  ensuring social  justice (Maharatna,  1996; Besley\n\
    and Burgess. 2000; Basu and Annemie, 2008). Since 1947,\nIndia has enacted perhaps\
    \ more land reform legislation than\nany other country in the world, it has not\
    \ succeeded in\nchanging in any essentials the power pattern, the deep\neconomic\
    \ disparities, nor the traditional hierarchical nature\nof intergroup relationships\
    \ which govern the economic life\nof village society. Indian government policy\
    \ was particularly\na big failure over land reform that precipitated the\nfragmentation\
    \ of land holdings which is being identified as\none of the main problems in enhancing\
    \ agricultural\nproductivity through technology interventions.\nStrengths that\
    \ India showcased post independence\nin food security\nAfter independence recognizing\
    \ the food scarcity, citizens\nof India, be it industrialists, housewives, farmers\
    \ or even\nastrologers kept coming up with ideas they were sure\nwould solve India’s\
    \ food problem and they were not\nprobably wrong.\nGreen revolution\nIt was Monkombu\
    \ Sambasivan Swaminathan, famous as\nFather of Green Revolution, who drove Indian\
    \ agriculture\nfrom food deficient to food sufficient country. In 1960 M. S.\n\
    Swaminathan launched the green revolution that increased\nthe food production\
    \ in the country tremendously and the\nintervention was the product of four things,\n\
    i.\nThe gene technology that  transformed and changed\npeople’s understanding\
    \ of wheat and rice yields.\nii. The services that took the technology to the\
    \ field like\nextension services, credit and insurance.\niii. The public policies\
    \ of input-output pricing like the prices\ncommission.\niv. The farmers’ enthusiasm,\
    \ that was very important in\nbringing green revolutuion.\nGreen revolution has\
    \ increased food production from\n50.80 million tons in 1950-51 to 176.40 in 1990-91\
    \ to 282\nmillion tons in 2018-19 an increase of 455%. The\ntremendous increase\
    \ in staple food production was product\nof increased yield per hectare through\
    \ evolving of high\nproducing varieties and increased soil fertility through use\n\
    of fertilizers. Yield got increased three times in wheat (0.85\ntons in 1961 to\
    \ 2.74 tons 2005) and two times in rice (1.54\ntons in 1961 to 3 tons in 2005)\
    \ (FAO http://economics.\ncimmyt.org). However at the same time the population\
    \ of\nIndia recorded tremendous increase from 376 million in 1950\nto 1380 million\
    \ in 2020. This population growth witnessed\nexponential increase during seventies\
    \ and eighties with\ngrowth rate of 2.5 and has decreased to 0.99 in 2020. India\n\
    was net importer of food grains and depended upon\ninternational food aid up to\
    \ mid-1960s and is now exporter\nof food grains to many countries and moved millions\

    \ This increase in food\nproduction may have made India self-sufficient in food\n\
    production but not food and nutritionally secure because of\naccess to food is\
    \ still a major issue in India.\nMany revolutions successively followed the green\n\
    revolution aimed at achieving food and nutritional security\nfor huge population\
    \ and has been achieved to larger extent\nby the technology interventions in agriculture\
    \ and allied\nsectors (Table 1 and Fig 2).\nWhite revolution\nIt was Dr. Verghese\
    \ Kurien who pioneered the Anand model\nof dairy cooperatives and replicated it\
    \ nationwide and\nbrought in White revolution in 1970 and became famous as\nFather\
    \ of White Revolution. White Revolution increased milk\nproduction from 20 million\
    \ tons in 1950-51 to 176 million\ntons in 2018-19 an increase of 780%. He pioneered\
    \ the\nconcept of dairy cooperatives and today in India we have\nover 190 thousand\
    \ dairy cooperative societies with the\nnorthern part of the country highest number\
    \ of cooperative\nsocieties of over 66 thousand (Statista Research\nDepartment, Nov \
    \ 10,  2020).  India  is  world’s  largest  milk\nproducer, it is exporting milk\
    \ products and has earned 1341\nCrores in 2019 (FAO 2020). The milk availability\
    \ in India\nper capita per day is 394 g which is much higher than the\nICMR recommendations\
    \ of 280 g.\nSilver revolution\nYet another revolution started way back in 1970s\
    \ has\nincreased the egg production tremendously post\nindependence. Production\
    \ of eggs was only 10 billion in 1950-\n51 that got increased to 103.3 billion\
    \ in 2018-19 an increase\nof 933%. This revolution was a step forward for making\
    \ good\nprotein available to the population at affordable prices.\nRed revolution\n\
    In 1980s red revolution was brought in and production of\nmeat got increased from\
    \ 1.65 million tons in 1961 to 8.10\nmillion tons in 2019 an increase of 390%.\
    \ India stands third\nlargest exporter of meat in the world today.\nBlue revolution\n\
    In 1985-86 India witnessed another success story that\nincreased aquaculture production\
    \ from 44843 tons in 1960\nto 8.9 million tons in 2018 an unimaginable increase\
    \ of\n20127%. India stands 2nd in the world for aquaculture\nproduction and this\
    \ sector is fast growing sector with growth\nrate of over 9%.\nYellow revolution\n\
    During year 1986-87 yellow revolution made India self-\nsufficient in oil production\
    \ by 1996-97. However, India has\nnot been able to maintain the production as\
    \ per the demand\nFig 2: Output of agriculture produce by product categories.\n\
    \ Volume 40 Issue 4 (December 2021)\n401\nSaga of Hunger in India- Challenges,\
    \ Chances and Resolutions: A Review\nand is presently observing a large gap between\
    \ demand\nand availability with per capita availability only 11 g/ person/\nday\
    \ as against the recommended 30 g/person /day.\nGolden revolution\nHorticulture\
    \ sector was targeted in 1990 and India had the\nperiod between 1991 to 2003 known\
    \ as the period of Golden\nrevolution. It increased fruit production from 96.50\
    \ million\ntons in 1990-91 to 313.35 million tons in 2019 an increase\nof 224%.\
    \ This made India a world leader in the production of\nbananas, mangoes, coconut\
    \ and spices and provided\nsustainable livelihood and nutrition options. Today\
    \ India has self\nsufficiency in food production and exports various food grains.\n\
    Challenges that India faces to see country hunger\nfree\nHunger index\nDespite\
    \ all these leaps, India is still a home to one quarter\nof world’s hungry. 194\
    \ million people in India go to bed\nhungry which accounts for over 14% of population,\
    \ of which\nwomen constitute 60%. 80% of all hungry live in rural India\nwhich\
    \ ironically stands food producers. India stands at 102\nrank in Global Hunger\
    \ Index (GHI) among 117 countries\nwith a score of 30, that puts the India in\
    \ a group of serious\nhunger nations (Fig 3). 25 million babies are born every\n\
    year of which 18% (4.54 million) are low birth weight and\n0.57 million die every\
    \ year. Of all these deaths, 88.8% die\nbefore first birth day. India has the\
    \ highest burden of neonatal\ndeaths. 45% of under-5 year deaths are due to under-\n\
    nutrition. India’s children are amongst the most malnourished\nin the world, 20%\
    \ are wasted, 37% are stunted, 15% under-\nnourished (Fig 4). 80% women of reproductive\
    \ age are\nanaemic, 75% women and children are Vit. A deficient. 70%\nIndians\
    \ consume less than 50% RDA of micronutrients and\nonly 9% newborn receive adequate\
    \ diet.\nMalnutrition or under-nourishment\nMalnutrition of the children has very\
    \ serious implications on\npopulation as well as national economy (Fig 5). It\
    \ is the\nmalnutrition that causes neonatal deaths, low birth weight\nbabies,\
    \ resulting in poor mental health, poor learning and\ncognitive abilities and\
    \ poor school performance, increased\ndisease susceptibility, low resistance,\
    \ high morbidity and\nmortality (Singh, 2020; Chatterjee et al., 2016) (Fig 6).\
    \ All\nthese factors ultimately lead to poor work capabilities, low\noutput capacity,\
    \ low income, poverty and reduced GDP.\nTherefore, a strong, secure and healthy\
    \ society contributes\nto the national economy as well.\nFig 4: Status of mal-nutrition\

    402\nSaga of Hunger in India- Challenges, Chances and Resolutions: A Review\n\
    Not only the food deficiency is responsible for\nmalnutrition, more calorie intake\
    \ has lead to various health\nproblems. The rising trend in purchases of snacks,\n\
    hydrogenated edible oils and ‘other processed foods’ have\nbeen some of the key\
    \ drivers of increased consumption of\nunhealthy processed food products. Further,\
    \ it has been\ndriven by the growing Indian policy focus on promoting food\nprocessing,\
    \ as well as liberalization of FDI in food processing\nand retailing, which enhanced\
    \ the availability and\naffordability of processed foods (Thow et al., 2016).\
    \  There\nhas been an increased intake of sugar, oils and highly\nprocessed food\
    \ in Indian diets  with more apparent changes\nidentified in urban India (Gulati\
    \ and Misra, 2014). Studies\nhave shown that the new dietary patterns are contributing\n\
    towards a number of non-communicable diseases like\ndiabetes, hypertension and\
    \ cardiovascular diseases in India,\nwhich account for a major share of total\
    \ deaths in the country\n(Prabhakaran et al., 2018).\nLand holding\nThe very important\
    \ issue with the country in reducing hunger\nis available land and land holdings.\
    \ India has only 2.3% of\nthe world’s land with 17% of world’s human population\
    \ (2nd\nlargest population in the world). In India 91% farmers are\nmarginal and\
    \ small farmers with less than 2 hectare of farm\nland that infact limits the\
    \ technological interventions in\nfarming, a major constraint in increasing crop\
    \ production.\nSoil status\nFurther the soil has fatigued, organic matter status\
    \ has\ndeclined and micronutrients are deficient. The problems of\nsoil acidity,\
    \ salinisation and sodification are very common.\nSoil organic carbon has reduced\
    \ to 0.3-0.4%, which is four times\nless than the ideal of 1.5%. India has highest\
    \ agriculture\nwater withdrawals, 2 times higher than China and 6 times\nhigher\
    \ than USA and it is projected that India will have 20%\nwater depletion by 2022.\
    \ Expansion of deserts, soil erosion,\nwater scarcity and extreme weather phenomena\
    \ as a result\nof climate change are becoming particularly apparent in\ncountries\
    \ that already suffer from hunger and poverty.\nFarmer’s plight\nBesides deteriorating\
    \ soil conditions for optimal food\nproduction, the farmer’s plight too precipitates\
    \ the situation\nof food insecurity. Ironically, 40% of farmers which are\nproducers\
    \ themselves are food insecure. People engaged\nwith agriculture farming are more\
    \ as labourers rather than\ncultivators, in 1960-61, 76% farmers were cultivators\
    \ and\nonly 24% labourers but as of now only 45% are cultivators\nand 55% are\
    \ labourers. Further 46% of India’s total workforce\nis engaged in agriculture\
    \ which in turn contributes only 17%\nto GDP, that in other terms means more input\
    \ and little\noutput, an inefficient system. There is an increasing trend\nin\
    \ urbanization and India is expected to lead the world in\nurbanization which\
    \ means people engaged in agriculture\nwill get reduced and agriculture produce\
    \ will suffer a lot given\nthe low land holding structure of India. It is argued\
    \ that the\nprojected 50 per cent increase in demand for agricultural\nproduction\
    \ from 2013 to 2050 (FAO, 2017) has to be\nachieved despite the ongoing degradation\
    \ of natural\nresources and the serious implications of climate change\non agriculture\
    \ which in itself is a big challenge.\nPeople associated with farming are losing\
    \ interest in it\nbecause there is no proper market link and many a times\nfarmers\
    \ do not get even the production price to their produce.\nLack of storage facilities\
    \ particularly for perishable produce\nfurther aggravates the farmer’s plight\
    \ and farmers\nsometimes lose everything. India’s total storage capacity is\n\
    70.5 million tons as against requirement of 80.5 million tones\nthat too is mostly\
    \ in Utter Pradesh for potatoes. Available\ncold storage capacity is less than\
    \ the half of the required,\nonly 29.7 million tons cold storage capacity as against\
    \ 61.7\nmillion tons. Transportation of food grains is not efficient\n1 \nFig\
    \ 6: Implications of malnutrition.\n Volume 40 Issue 4 (December 2021)\n403\n\
    and more than 30% of grains supplied through the public\ndistribution system is\
    \ lost because of inefficient storage and\ntransportation system in India. Studies\
    \ have shown that\nfarmers have low price realisation and there is huge wastage\n\
    in the supply chain due to fragmentation, poor storages and\ninefficient information\
    \ flow (Negi and Anand, 2016; Pingali\net al., 2019, Gokarn and Kuthambalayan,\
    \ 2017). Studies\nalso show that India has not been able to reach its full export\n\
    potential due to fragmented supply chain and gaps in\nmitigating the demand of\
    \ importing countries (Mukherjee\net al, 2019; Goyal et al., 2017).\nIndian agriculture\
    \ farmers do not have insurance and\ncredit facilities for their produce which\
    \ makes them more\nvulnerable to economic losses. Minimum support price, yet\n\
    talked enough but is not effectively been worked out and\nimplemented.\nLivestock\
    \ sector\nSimilarly in livestock sector, India keeps high proportion of\nlow yielding\
    \ indigenous livestock with no effective policy to\naddress the issue. Artificial\
    \ insemination for improvement\nof local germplasm with improved and exotic germplasm\n\
    has not achieved promising success and India still has only\n40% AI success. Embryo\
    \ transfer technology has yielded\nscores of research papers in peer journals\
    \ but has not been\nimpressively implemented in the field with the result there\n\
    has not been much improvement in the productivity per\nanimal. India has a huge\
    \ potential of exporting livestock\nproducts owing to large livestock population\
    \ but again due\nto lack of standard quality control mechanism, inability to\n\
    adhere to the food safety standards and poor cold chain\nmechanism, India has\
    \ not made success in increasing the\nglobal market for livestock products that\
    \ stands only 2%.\nGender inequity\nWomen form an integral part of the agricultural\
    \ sector and\nin India women make up a majority of the agricultural\nworkforce\
    \ and are often compelled to work to meet their\nfamilies’ basic needs. While\
    \ their contributions are recognized\nas central to the food and nutrition security\
    \ of households\nand communities, their work is not recognized or supported\n\
    adequately by public policy and social institutions. Indian\nwomen manage agricultural\
    \ work on family farms and receive\nno income, are usually overworked and have\
    \ no wage-linked\nbenefits (Rao, 2012). Apart from agricultural work, both\nhousehold\
    \ work and child and elder care responsibilities\nremain assigned to women within\
    \ existing gender divisions\nof labour (Springer et al., 2012), with the additional\
    \ task of\ncaring for their men. Women continue to face inequality across\nkey\
    \ development indicators including health, education and\nnutrition; discriminatory\
    \ laws and high levels of precarity in\nterms of income, employment conditions,\
    \ safety and well-\nbeing. Gender inequity in India is a big challenge in attaining\n\
    zero hunger as women are main players in Indian agriculture\nand their views,\
    \ ideas and suggestions in agricultural farming\nare not being taken to board.\
    \ Violence against women is a\nstructural barrier to the attainment of food and\
    \ nutrition security\nvia a range of pathways; i. withholding food or restricting\
    \ funds\nto purchase food (Usta et al., 2013); ii. controlling when and\nhow they\
    \ eat (Lentz, 2018), iii. pushing women into high-\nrisk behaviour to secure money\
    \ for food (Rao, 2019) or iv.\nnormalization of physical violence related to the\
    \ non-\nperformance of food-related work (food production, shopping,\ncooking\
    \ etc.) (Bellows et al., 2015; Chilton et al., 2013).\nAgriculture system in India\
    \ is not designed to promote\nhealth. There is more focus on increasing productivity\
    \ and\nnot the nutritive quality that is why India may be food secure\nbut not\
    \ nutritionally secure. Little priority for health sector in\nIndia has put it\
    \ at the bottom of the GHI list. A meagre 1.4%\nof GDP is spend on healthcare\
    \ in India that otherwise stands\n17% in America, 8% in Britain and 3% in China\
    \ with world’s\nlargest population. India is far behind the world average\nfor\
    \ physicians (0.6 V/S 1.3/ 1000) and hospital beds (0.9\nV/S 3/1000). Indians\
    \ are the sixth biggest out-of-pocket\nhealth spenders in the low-middle income\
    \ group of 50\nnations (Vipul  2017; Swagata, 2017). Compounded by high\nout-of-pocket\
    \ expenditures, health-care expenditures\nexacerbate poverty, with about 39 million\
    \ additional people\nfalling into poverty every year as a result of such\nexpenditures\
    \ (Balarajan et al. 2011).\nThe governments mostly do not align their policies\
    \ to\nthe needs of the poorest population. There is lack of\nstrategies to promote\
    \ agriculture in the country in such a way\nthat no-one goes hungry. Corruption\
    \ is one of the greatest\nobstacles to development, land grabbing is a big problem.\n\
    Chances, the India has to become hunger free\ncountry\nWe have discussed in length\
    \ about the challenges India\ndoes confront in achieving zero hunger in the country.\
    \ At\nthe same time India has to identify the opportunities that\ncan be explored\
    \ and availed to see India food and\nnutritionally secure. Some of the opportunities\
    \ that can be\nexplored and researched for ameliorating the hunger in India\n\
    include:\na. Genetic diversity\nIndia has 12% plant, 17% animal and 10% fish genetic\n\
    sources of the world. This treasure with the India can be\nexploited to have the\
    \ best competent, efficient, high\nproducing and resilient varieties of crops\
    \ and livestock to\nmake India hunger free nation. Nutrition-sensitive and\nclimate-smart\
    \ agriculture interventions can tap local potential\nto promote agricultural productivity\
    \ that meets nutritional\nrequirements.\nb. Climatic diversity\nIndia has all\
    \ the 15 climates of the world and 46 soil types\nthat can be exploited to have\
    \ food production in all the\nclimatic and soil niches with nutritionally diverse\
    \ foods. India\nis looking for designated areas with a specific type of food\n\
    production depending upon the soil and climate conditions\nof that area. India\
    \ has, long days and sunshine hours that\nis suitable for the cultivation round\
    \ the year.\nSaga of Hunger in India- Challenges, Chances and Resolutions: A Review\n\
    \           Asian Journal of Dairy and Food Research\n404\nc. Irrigation potential\n\
    India has roughly half of the cultivable area rainfed without\nany proper mechanism\
    \ of irrigation. India has scores of large\nrivers and water bodies that can be\
    \ exploited and managed\nto irrigate the land for food production. This will also\
    \ improve\nthe utilization efficiency. Thus there exists great scope in\nincreasing\
    \ irrigated area, gross sown area and hence\nassured food production.\nd. Work\
    \ force\nIndia has low age dependency ratio 49.2% that means India\nhas a good\
    \ proportion of population in a workable age. This\nopportunity with the India\
    \ is a great asset to face challenges.\nToday, India is one of the youngest countries\
    \ in the world\nwith more than 62% of the population in the working age\ngroup\
    \ (15-59 years) and more than 54% of the total\npopulation below 25 years of age\
    \ (Times of India, 2020).\ne. Livestock resources\nIndia is a cattle wealthy nation.\
    \ Highest livestock population\nwith great diversity makes India a potential country\
    \ for animal\nproducts exportation. India has a long coastline that confers\n\
    it a potential to strengthen the national economy through\nblue revolution. Milk,\
    \ meat, fish and their products have a\npromising demand in many countries. India\
    \ has to build up\nthe export policies and quality control mechanism to invite\n\
    exports of various food products.\nf. Welfare measures\n Although the national\
    \ government has not strengthened the\nagricultural sector through better prices,\
    \ assured\nprocurement or investments in climate-proofing, several\nstate governments\
    \ in India have sought to ameliorate rural\ndistress and other related effects\
    \ of agrarian stagnation\nthrough welfare measures. Leaders in this respect are\
    \ the\nstates of Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh with 55 and 48\nwelfare schemes,\
    \ respectively.\ng. Sanitation and health services\nReaching the goal of nutrition\
    \ security is equally dependent\non state provisioning of clean drinking water,\
    \ sanitation and\nreliable health services. Sanitation, in the Clean India\nCampaign\
    \ (Swachh Bharat Abhiyan), is interpreted as\nuniversal access to toilets. Although\
    \ this is undoubtedly\nimportant, inadequate attention has been paid to the disposal\n\
    of solid and liquid wastes that contributes to the growing\nburden of infectious\
    \ diseases (India State-level Disease\nBurden Initiative Collaborators, 2019).\
    \ Similarly, whereas\nuniversal health insurance (Ayushman Bharat) may support\n\
    curative care, primary health care provisioning remains weak,\nwhich is key to\
    \ disease prevention. The responsibility of health\nand nutrition security has\
    \ been placed with low-paid and\npoorly trained women community health and nutrition\
    \ workers,\nwith little power in their local, rural contexts (WHO, 2019).\nThere\
    \ remains great opportunity with Government of India to\nadequately support and\
    \ empower these workers to perform\ntheir roles, both through skill-building and\
    \ strengthening of\nreferral and back-up health services.\nResolutions to have\
    \ hunger free India\nNutrition sensitive agriculture\nNutrition-sensitive agriculture\
    \ is an approach that seeks to\nensure the production of a variety of affordable,\
    \ nutritious,\nculturally appropriate and safe foods in adequate quantity\nand\
    \ quality to meet the dietary requirements of populations\nin a sustainable manner.\
    \ Now when India is self sufficient in\nfood production, the priority should be\
    \ nutritionally rich and\ndiverse foods. It is high time to use technologies like\n\
    Biofortification, fortification, food diversification, soil\nenrichment, crop\
    \ diversification that can lead to nutritional\nsecurity. We need to have our\
    \ food baskets with varieties of\nfood items that can ensure nutritional demands\
    \ of a person.\nThere is need to include non-grain items viz fruits,\nvegetables,\
    \ beans and animal products to the food basket.\nIndia is not adequately prepared\
    \ to meet the requirements\nof dietary diversity, without enhanced trade. Diversification\n\
    on a large scale (implementation at regional or national level)\ncan help enhance\
    \ availability of diverse foods in markets\nand reduce prices of nutritious foods.\
    \ Integrated farming\nsystems (legume-based cropping systems including crop\n\
    rotation and intercropping, rice-wheat farming systems) favour\nboth diversification\
    \ and sustainable intensification of\nproduction. Home gardening with emphasis\
    \ on nutrient-dense\nvarieties of vegetables and fruit trees and small-scale\n\
    integrated farming systems (mixed crop-livestock-aquaculture\nsystems) have potential\
    \ to improve diet quality and raise levels\nof nutrition for producing households.\
    \ In addition to protein\nand energy, animal source foods are excellent source\
    \ of\nselected micronutrients like iron, zinc, calcium, vitamin A,\nvitamin B-12\
    \ and various essential amino-acids.\nUse of neglected and underutilized species\
    \ (NUS)\nFrom a food system perspective, dietary and production\ndiversity need\
    \ to improve to address malnutrition. NUS are\nunder-explored that offer tremendous\
    \ opportunities for\nfighting poverty, hunger and malnutrition. Director General\n\
    FAO highlighted, the crucial role of NUS in the fight against\nhunger and are\
    \ a key resource for agriculture and rural\ndevelopment (FAO, 2012a). Historically,\
    \ underutilized plants\nhave been used for food and other uses on a large scale\n\
    and, in some countries, are still common, especially among\nsmall or marginal\
    \ farmers in rural areas where many are\ntraded locally and a lucky few NUS are\
    \ nutritious, climate\nresilient, economically viable and adapt to local conditions,\n\
    especially in marginal areas. NUS have made their way to\nexport niche markets\
    \ around the world (Akinnifesi et al.,\n2008). NUS have high nutritional value\
    \ and can be an\nessential source of micronutrients, protein, energy and fibre,\n\
    which contribute to food and nutrition security.\nSustainable intensification\n\
    There is no problem in the genetic potential of crops or\nproduction inputs, instead,\
    \ the problem lies in the\ndegradation of natural resources and their yield-related\n\
    functions. Therefore, closing the yield gap, a different\nconcept of sustainable\
    \ intensification, has been coined by\nFAO (www.fao.org/ag/save-and-grow). Sustainable\n\
    Saga of Hunger in India- Challenges, Chances and Resolutions: A Review\n Volume\
    \ 40 Issue 4 (December 2021)\n405\nintensification means achieving the highest\
    \ possible\nproduction, applying all necessary technologies, while\nkeeping the\
    \ environmental impact below the threshold of\nnatural recovery (United Nations,\
    \ 2015). Conservation\nagriculture is based on key principles including minimum\n\
    tillage, retaining a permanent soil cover and crop\ndiversification (Suraj and\
    \ Behera 2014). Precision agriculture\nis an emerging example that utilizes data\
    \ on spatial and\ntemporal variations in the agroecosystem to make accurate\n\
    agronomic decisions without wasting resources and time.\nEncouraging local production\
    \ of diversified foods to be\navailable locally can be a way out to eliminate\
    \ hunger from\nthe country. Up-gradation of local germplasm, identification\n\
    and propagation of indigenous nutritious plant and animal\nspecies that are more\
    \ resilient and adapted to local\nconditions can make India free from hunger.\
    \ Selection and\nproduction of species and varieties should be based not\nonly\
    \ on yields but also on nutrient content (concept of nutrient\nproductivity),\
    \ thereby enhancing the nutrient supply of\nagricultural products, especially\
    \ for micronutrients.\nCommunity-level initiatives for supporting the saving and\n\
    exchange of seeds (community seed banks, village seed\nfairs, smallholder seed\
    \ enterprises) and protecting\necosystems \n(community-based \nnatural \nresource\n\
    management, reforestation, promotion of micronutrient-rich\nforest foods) should\
    \ be practised to enhance availability of\nand access to genetic resources, Strengthening\
    \ local food\nsystems and empowering local people in local production of\nnutritious,\
    \ adapted and diversified cultivars. Locally available\nfoods must find place\
    \ in the food basket of its locals and its\ndistribution to immediate areas to\
    \ reduce wastage and cost.\nAccessibility to food\nGlobal food security is today\
    \ more of an issue of access to\nfood than its availability. Average dietary energy\
    \ supply\nadequacy (ADESA) shows that minimum nutritional\nrequirement per capita,\
    \ is above sufficient levels globally\n(FAOSTAT) and yet, more than 800 million\
    \ people across\nthe globe are undernourished and malnutrition. This implies\n\
    grossly uneven distribution of food resources and\nemphasizes the urgent need\
    \ for correcting distortions in food\nmarkets. It is a major issue that can be\
    \ addressed by\nproviding effective, efficient and economical public\ndistribution\
    \ system, transportation system, cooperative\nsystem and marketing system. Development\
    \ of quality\ninfrastructure for food storage, cold stores, cold chain\nfacilities\
    \ and logistic services are of prime importance to\nensure accessibility of population\
    \ to food. Accessibility to\nfood is linked to many aspects and a holistic approach\
    \ is\nneeded to ensure accessibility of population to food. It\nincludes increasing\
    \ purchasing capacity, reducing poverty,\nminimising food wastage, abolishing\
    \ fragmented marketing\nwith commission agents and middlemen mafia. One of the\n\
    key issues leading to food losses and wastage is that the\nproduction and consumption\
    \ hubs are located in different\nregions across the entire country for example\
    \ for three key\ncommodities - potato, onion and tomato, which are core to\nIndian\
    \ diet, the production and consumption hubs are far away,\ntherefore, there is\
    \ a need for efficient logistics and supply chain\nnetworks, both in terms of\
    \ physical infrastructure and\ntechnology to manage and match the demand and supply\n\
    to ensure accessibility of people to the food.\nEffective and precision irrigation\
    \ system\n50% of the land is irrigated and 50% remains rainfed in the\ncountry\
    \ that leaves a good scope for increasing the food\nproduction through increasing\
    \ irrigation. India does have\ngreat rivers with rich source as Himalayas that\
    \ can be\nharvested for irrigation of farmlands. India needs to build\ninfrastructure\
    \ for its channelling to different areas across\nthe States. Most parts of the\
    \ India receive monsoon rains\nthat can be harvested, stored and then distributed\
    \ across\nthe States to irrigate farmlands in the country. There has\nbeen little\
    \ rather no change in arable land which was 155\nmillion hectares in 1961 and\
    \ 156 million hectares in 2016 but\nof course decrease in per capita holding from\
    \ 0.34 hectares\nin 1961 to 0.12 hectares in 2016. Similarly India needs to\n\
    develop crop varieties that have less water withdrawals.\nSustainable food value\
    \ chains\nAn effective food system transformation will necessitate firm\ncommitments\
    \ at the international and national levels to\npromote the required policies and\
    \ investments at national\nand local levels. In practical terms, this would need\
    \ to include\nfour main dimensions: (i) underpinning healthier populations\nby\
    \ enabling access to nutritious and healthy food for all; (ii)\nguaranteeing sustainable\
    \ food production, processing, trade\nand retailing; (iii) mitigating and adapting\
    \ to climate change;\n(iv) improving smallholder farmer livelihoods and resilience\n\
    by enhancing prosperity in farming and rural communities.\nFAO has developed guiding\
    \ principles on sustainable food\nvalue chains which can be used as a framework\
    \ for\nupgrading value chains (FAO 2014b).\nMinimising wastages\nWastages do happen\
    \ from food production to consumer’s\nplate and this loss if reduced can alone\
    \ make India free\nfrom hunger. Use of efficient strategies at the farm level,\n\
    efficient transportation system from farm to stores and\nconsumers and ultimately\
    \ proper utilization by the\nconsumers without wasting much can do wonders in\n\
    eliminating hunger from the country. In India food losses\noccur mainly at early\
    \ stages of the food value chain.\nStrengthening the supply chain through the\
    \ direct support\nof farmers and investments in cold chain infrastructure,\ntransportation\
    \ and safe packaging could help to reduce the\namount of food loss. Post-harvest\
    \ handling, processing and\nstorage contributes to a secure food supply and thus\
    \ of\nnutrients throughout the year. It also reserves the quality of\nharvested\
    \ raw material as it moves along the food supply\nchain from the producer to the\
    \ market; reduces losses and\nmakes fresh produce available in local markets as\
    \ well as\nin distant locations.\nSaga of Hunger in India- Challenges, Chances\
    \ and Resolutions: A Review\n           Asian Journal of Dairy and Food Research\n\
    406\nFood processing and value addition of food products\nOut of the total agricultural\
    \ output, the share of food processing\nsector in India was only 46.87 per cent\
    \ in 2017-18.\nComparatively, the share for other developing countries such\n\
    as Brazil (70 per cent), Malaysia (80 per cent) and Philippines\n(78 per cent)\
    \ is much higher (Reserve Bank of India, RBI-\n2020). One of the effective methods\
    \ to preserve the surplus\nfood particularly perishable items and make it available\
    \ to\nthe consumers in the country or outside the country is to process\nthe food.\
    \ Value addition is one of the effective strategies to\npreserve the foods, to\
    \ utilize the non-conventional foods and\nto fetch more. The strategy can be effectively\
    \ utilized to make\nuse of agriculture by-products, which is only 25%.\nResearch\
    \ and innovations\nResearch and innovations will always remain effective tools\n\
    in any system to face the challenges. The nations which\nare using innovative\
    \ techniques are economically and\ntechnologically ahead. In India we have our\
    \ own demands\nin agriculture farming system. Our landholdings are very\nlittle\
    \ and thus need to have farm machinery and technologies\nthat favour our small\
    \ farm lands be it in seed sowing, land\ntilling, crop planting, thrashing, chopping,\
    \ harvesting etc.\nThere is need for more investment on applied post-harvest\n\
    management research/technologies, policy change to focus\non infrastructure development\
    \ including cold storage,\nrefrigerated transportation and efficient distribution\
    \ systems\netc. Research and data collection, data analysis is most\nimportant\
    \ in contemporary scientifically advanced world to\nkeep pace with the increased\
    \ demands. Weather predictions,\ndisease prevalence, disease forecasting and application\
    \ of\nartificial intelligence in agriculture production and\nmanagement is dependent\
    \ on data collection and analysis.\nAwareness among consumers\nAwareness is must\
    \ in present scenario of globalization.\nConsumer is presented with varieties\
    \ of food items claiming\nlot many nutritional benefits with high pricing for\
    \ the product.\nThere is need to aware the consumer through target\ncampaigning.\
    \ There is need to educate the consumers about\nthe requirement of different varieties\
    \ in the food basket\naccording to the physiological status, age, sex and physical\n\
    activities of the consumers. Pregnant ladies, lactating\nmothers, neonates, juveniles,\
    \ athletes, women and men have\ndifferent food requirements and they must be made\
    \ aware\nof their nutritional needs and food varieties that can fulfil their\n\
    nutritional requirements so that a healthy society is ensured.\nStrict implementation\
    \ of product standard specifications\nand food safety standards\nIndia has a huge\
    \ potential of export of agricultural and livestock\nproducts but has not achieved\
    \ much progress in it simply\nbecause of lack of standard product specification\
    \ and\ncertification. Quality control is a major issue with the products\nthat\
    \ have an export market. Therefore India has to ensure\nquality control of agricultural\
    \ products through establishment\nof high end analytical laboratories, sanitation\
    \ procedures,\nSPS, traceability and observance of standard safety\nmeasures that\
    \ can boost the export of food items from India\nin the global market and make\
    \ its economy flourishing.\nRegional trade cooperation and liberalization in\n\
    agriculture products\nIndia is the biggest partner in SAARC, however, the regional\n\
    trade cooperation between the countries is very meagre may\nbe because of undue\
    \ regulatory restrictions, procedural and\ninfrastructural barriers to trade or\
    \ due to certain political reasons.\nIndia needs to strengthen the trade agreements\
    \ with\nneighbouring countries to make diversified food available\nto the population\
    \ at reasonable and affordable rates. Thus India\nneeds strong liberalized trade\
    \ policies, political will and firm\nresolve. India has to increase intra-regional\
    \ agriculture trade\n(Nagesh and Joseph, 2020).\nREFERENCES\nAkinnifesi, F.K.,\

    EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nHighlights\n ▪\nGrowing trees outside forests (ToF) presents\
    \ \na significant environmental and economic \nopportunity in India. Nearly 80\
    \ million hectares \n(Mha) can sequester 3.4 gigatons of carbon dioxide-\nequivalent\
    \ (Gt  CO2e) by 2040 to help India achieve \nits international climate commitments\
    \ (Chaturvedi \net al. 2018). It can also support food and livelihood \nsecurity\
    \ for rural India, especially for its poor and \nvulnerable groups. \n ▪\nIndia\
    \ has several enabling policies and schemes \nembedding a range of monetary and\
    \ nonmonetary \nincentives for the scaling of ToF through \ninterventions such\
    \ as agroforestry. We analyze \nincentives implementation in the six states of\
    \ \nGujarat, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Odisha, Punjab, \nand Telangana to identify\
    \ enabling conditions that \ncan spur ToF expansion as well as the barriers that\
    \ \nimpede implementation.  \n ▪\nBased on our analysis, we propose developing\
    \ \nlandscape-level restoration strategies and plans, \nreorienting or shifting\
    \ incentives to protect, \npromote, and improve research on traditional \nToF\
    \ systems, targeting the needs of women and \nmarginalized groups who are disproportionately\
    \ \ndependent on multipurpose trees, and improving \nthe enabling environment\
    \ for existing incentives to \nmotivate farmers and other practitioners to protect\
    \ \nand expand ToF systems.\n2  |  \nIntroduction\nGrowing trees outside forests\
    \ (ToF) offers  \nmanifold environmental and socioeconomic \nbenefits. Key benefits\
    \ include improved livelihoods, jobs \nand income generation, enhanced soil health,\
    \ biodiver-\nsity conservation, carbon sequestration, and increased \nresilience\
    \ of local communities (GoI 2014).  In a separate \nstudy, we documented the existence\
    \ of at least 47 systems \nof ToF in India including agroforestry, urban forestry,\
    \ \nblock plantations, and linear plantations.1 The expansion \nof ToF can support\
    \ India’s international commitments \nincluding the Nationally Determined Contribution\
    \ \n(NDC), the Bonn Challenge2, Land Degradation Neutral-\nity target3, and Sustainable\
    \ Development Goals (SDGs). \nIn the last decade, India increased focus on ToF\
    \ expan-\nsion through policies and schemes that incentivize and \nsupport farmers\
    \ and other practitioners to take up ToF \nsystems, particularly agroforestry.\
    \ Key policies/schemes \ninclude the Sub-Mission on Agroforestry (SMAF), \nNational\
    \ Mission for a Green India (GIM), National Bam-\nboo Mission, and Nagar Van (city\
    \ forests), among others.\nThe implementation of these policies/schemes, \nthough,\
    \ has yet to be optimized. There are several \nchallenges that impede implementation,\
    \ such as lack of \nquality planting material; technical capacity and knowl-\n\
    edge gaps; market and finance gaps; and inadequate \nattention to issues around\
    \ land and tree tenure, gender, \nand social inclusion (ICFRE 2020; Singh et al.\

    \ PAPER  |  March 2022  |  3\nRoadmap for Scaling Trees outside Forests in India\n\
    Key findings \nOur study shows that India’s ToF policies/\nschemes offer at least\
    \ seven types of monetary \nand three types of nonmonetary incentives to \nspur\
    \ ToF. Monetary incentives include input subsidies, \nperformance-based payments,\
    \ grants, credit, benefit-\nsharing, minimum support price, and insurance. The\
    \ \nnonmonetary incentives are supply chain infrastructure, \nregulatory incentives,\
    \ and technical assistance. \nAgroforestry, which includes trees on bunds or \n\
    boundaries, farm forestry, fruit orchards, and agri-horti-\nforestry, emerged\
    \ as the most common ToF system \npromoted by the policies/schemes. \nThe analysis\
    \ highlighted key enabling conditions \nthat support the six states to implement\
    \ ToF \npolicies and incentives. Strong political and \nbureaucratic commitment\
    \ to expansion of ToF \nunderpins effective implementation of policies, \nparticularly\
    \ through alignment with other national \npolicies. Nongovernmental organizations\
    \ (NGOs) and \nresearch organizations provide crucial support in \nresearch and\
    \ awareness-building, and often bridge the \ndisconnect between government departments\
    \ and \nfarmers on the ground. The private sector, through \ninnovative business\
    \ models and functioning value \nchains, plays an important role in incentivizing\
    \ farmers \nto adopt ToF systems. \nWe found barriers in the six states that impede\
    \ \nsuccess of policies and uptake of ToF. Farmers \nhighlighted the lack of incentives\
    \ for protecting existing \nToF systems and promoting traditional ToF practices\
    \ \nwith native tree species. Such native systems are \nprioritized by women and\
    \ other marginalized people \nwho are dependent on these multipurpose trees for\
    \ \nfood, fuelwood, fodder, and nontimber forest produce \n(NTFP). Gaps in research\
    \ and extension services also \nlimited awareness among farmers on available ToF\
    \ \nmodels and policy incentives. Lack of quality planting \nmaterial, continuing\
    \ ambiguities regarding permits for \nharvest and transit of farm-grown timber\
    \ across state \nlines, and poorly developed value chains were \nhighlighted by\
    \ stakeholders as disincentives preventing \nfarmers from taking up ToF systems.\
    \ Lack of attention \nto tree tenure dissuaded tenant farmers and women \nfrom\
    \ practicing ToF interventions. \nWay forward \nTo support the effective implementation\
    \ of ToF \nincentives and policies, we need to  develop \nrestoration strategies\
    \ using a landscape \napproach, reorient or shift incentives to suit  \nthe local\
    \ context, and strengthen the enabling \nenvironment for existing incentives.\
    \ Based on our \nstudy, we recommend reorienting incentives to protect \nexisting\
    \ ToF, promoting traditional ToF models, and \nimproving research and extensions\
    \ services around native \ntree species. The reoriented incentives can include\
    \ \ntargeted provisions for women and marginalized groups \n(e.g., Scheduled Caste\
    \ and Scheduled Tribe) that are often \nthe primary practitioners and beneficiaries\
    \ of traditional \nToF systems. There is scope to extend incentives such as \n\
    minimum support price and supply chain infrastructure \nto wider timber and nontimber\
    \ ToF produce from the \ncurrent narrow focus on just a few tree species. \nWe\
    \ found the need to strengthen the enabling \nenvironment for existing incentives\
    \ to achieve \nbetter outcomes. For instance, input subsidies can be \nmade effective\
    \ by establishing quality control and \nstandards for planting material and nurseries.\
    \ Insurance \nof ToF systems can be promoted by subsidizing \npremium payments\
    \ through government programs or \nthe private sector. Implementing certification\
    \ standards \nfor farm-grown timber can address transit-related \nchallenges.\
    \ Promoting participation of NGOs and \nresearch organizations through grants\
    \ or inclusive \ngovernance models can provide farmers with the \nnecessary technical\
    \ assistance for successfully \nimplementing ToF systems. Strengthening the role\
    \  \nof the private sector, establishing value chains, and \nfostering ToF entrepreneurs\
    \ can also inspire farmers  \nto take up tree-based interventions.\n1. BACKGROUND\n\
    Landscape restoration \nGlobally, human-induced land degradation negatively \n\
    impacts 3.2 billion people, contributing to distress \nmigration and increased\
    \ conflict. Degrading lands drive \nspecies extinction and intensify climate change\
    \ (IPBES \n2018). There is a consensus that land management \nstrategies contribute\
    \ to climate change mitigation and \nadaptation, combat desertification, and enhance\
    \ food \nsecurity (IPCC 2018, 2019). Landscape restoration, \nwhich is the long-term\
    \ process of regaining ecological \nintegrity and enhancing human well-being,\
    \ includes a \nrange of interventions such as natural regeneration, \nmixed-species\
    \ plantation, and agroforestry, among \nothers (Chazdon et al. 2017). In India,\
    \ where 700 million \npeople in rural areas are dependent on forestry and \nagriculture\
    \ for their livelihoods and sustenance, \nlandscape restoration provides a sustainable\
    \ pathway \nfor rejuvenating land, strengthening the flow of \n4  |  \necosystem\
    \ services, ensuring food and nutritional \nsecurity, and enhancing livelihoods.\
    \ The government of \nIndia (GOI) has made several international \ncommitments\
    \ to restore lands. This includes the Bonn \nChallenge and the Land Degradation\
    \ Neutrality (LDN \ntarget commitment to restore combined 26 million \nhectares\
    \ (Mha) of degraded and deforested land by \n2030; India’s goal under the Nationally\
    \ Determined \nContribution (NDC) to create an additional carbon sink \nof 2.5\
    \ to 3.0 billion tons of carbon dioxide–equivalent \n(gigatons [Gt] CO2e) by 2030\
    \ through improved forest \nand tree cover; and biodiversity targets to achieve\
    \ the \nglobally shared Biodiversity Vision 2050. Landscape \nrestoration can\
    \ also contribute to many of the \nSustainable Development Goals (SDGs), as shown\
    \ in \nFigure 1 below. \nTrees outside forests\nIn the Indian context, trees outside\
    \ forests (ToF) refers \nto tree resources found outside of Recorded Forest \n\
    Areas (RFAs) (areas recorded as forests by the \ngovernment) irrespective of patch\
    \ size or area (FSI \n2019). The Forest Survey of India (FSI) estimated the \n\
    extent of ToF as 29.38 Mha, which is 36.4 percent of the \ntotal forest and tree\
    \ cover in the country (FSI 2019) (see \nFigure 2). Farmers and other stakeholders\
    \ practice \ndiverse ToF systems in India. As part of another ongoing \nstudy,\
    \ we are conducting a systematic literature review \nof the array of ToF systems.\
    \ Our preliminary results \nidentified at least 47 types of ToF systems, including\
    \ \nagroforestry, monoculture or mixed-species plantations \nin private and common\
    \ lands, block plantations, fruit \norchards, urban forestry, home gardens with\
    \ trees, and \nlinear plantations along roads and rivers, among others. \nAmong\
    \ the different types of ToF systems, agroforestry \nemerged as the largest subset.\
    \ Estimates of area under \nagroforestry vary considerably. For instance, Dhyani\
    \ \nand Handa  (2013) estimated agroforests cover at \napproximately 25.32 Mha\
    \ while the FSI (2013) \nestimated 11.1 Mha. Agroforestry is the collective name\

    \ Trees outside Forests in India\nfor land-use systems where trees are deliberately\
    \ \nintegrated with croplands and/or livestock. Agroforestry \nprovides a range\
    \ of environmental benefits that include \nsoil moisture conservation, improved\
    \ flow of water, \ncarbon sequestration through above-ground biomass, \nand improvement\
    \ in biodiversity (Sarvade and Singh \n2014; FAO 2015). \nThe biophysical potential\
    \ for expansion of ToF \nin India is immense. The “Restoration Opportunities \n\

    \ an area of over 50 Mha of \nopportunity for ToF, referred to as mosaic restoration\
    \ in \nthe atlas (see Figures 3a and 3b). Here, the largest \npotential is for\
    \ agroforestry in rainfed farmlands. The \ntree cover in mosaic areas can have\
    \ a wide range. One \nstudy shows that 60–100 trees per ha or 20 percent of \n\
    tree cover is a common practice in India (Saxena 2015). \nIncreasing tree cover\
    \ in the mosaic restoration areas to \n20 percent can sequester 3.4 Gt of CO2e\
    \ through \nabove-ground biomass alone by 2040 (Chaturvedi et al. \n2018).5  \n\

    87 Mha\n6  |  \nThe GoI has shown its commitment to expansion \nof ToF through\
    \ various domestic policies, \nschemes, programs, and missions. India was the\
    \ \nfirst country in the world to adopt a National \nAgroforestry Policy, in 2014,\
    \ which led to the creation of \nthe Sub-Mission on Agroforestry (SMAF) under\
    \ the \numbrella of the National Mission for Sustainable \nAgriculture (NMSA)\
    \ (NMSA n.d.).  ToF systems such as \nagroforestry, urban forestry, and linear\
    \ plantations have \nbeen promoted through various national-level schemes \nand\
    \ policies like the National Bamboo Mission (NBM), \nNational and State Rural\
    \ Livelihoods Missions, Mission \nfor Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH),\
    \ \nNational Clean Air Programme, Green Highways \nMission, and Nagar Van for\
    \ urban forestry. These \npolicies and schemes have been augmented with other\
    \ \nefforts like the National Bank of Agriculture and Rural \nDevelopment (NABARD)–supported\
    \ wadi program6,  \nsubnational initiatives through state governments’ social\
    \ \nforestry schemes—as well as by projects by NGOs, the \nprivate sector, research\
    \ institutions, and local \ncommunities. \nExperience of implementation of these\
    \ policies/\nschemes has been varied. India’s flagship policy for \nToF, the National\
    \ Agroforestry Policy (2014) and the \nrelated mission, SMAF (2016), offer an\
    \ overview of the \nopportunities and challenges facing ToF in India. Our \nconsultations\
    \ with experts and stakeholders show that \nSMAF has had limited success in the\
    \ five years since it \nwas initiated. It has lagged in enabling farmers, \nparticularly\
    \ small and marginal landholders, to \nsuccessfully implement agroforestry systems.\
    \ The \nuptake and implementation of SMAF has been uneven \nacross the states,\
    \ with varying levels of outcomes. Only \n20 states and two Union Territories\
    \ (UTs) have made \nthe necessary notifications for the relaxation of transit\
    \ \nregulations, which is a prerequisite for the availing of \nthe benefits of\
    \ SMAF (Parliament, Lok Sabha. 2021a)7.   \nAmong other policies/schemes, the\
    \ National Mission for \na Green India (GIM) achieved only 2.8 percent of its\
    \ \nrestoration target as of March 2020 due to inadequate \nbudget allocation\
    \ (GoI 2021; MoEFCC 2019). On the \nother hand, states have successfully leveraged\
    \ the \nMahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment \nGuarantee Scheme (MGNREGS)\
    \ to expand ToF, by \nsupporting activities related to drought-proofing and \n\
    agroforestry (See Appendix A). \nIncentives play a pivotal role as powerful policy\
    \ \nlevers. While incentives on their own cannot achieve \nToF goals, they are\
    \ instruments that can be used to set \nup the right enabling conditions to achieve\
    \ a policy goal. \nGlobally, the experience with incentives has been varied. \n\
    There are several examples where countries have used \npublic incentives to pursue\
    \ ToF systems such as \nagroforestry as a development strategy that offers \n\
    immense learning for India (see Appendix B). The \nincentives include subsidies,\
    \ credits, reduced tax rates, \npayments for ecosystem services (PES), and \n\
    sustainability certification schemes. Incentives can also \ntake the shape of\
    \ regulatory reforms that provide use, \nmanagement, and benefit rights to communities\
    \ \n(Urzedo et al. 2020; Cronkleton et al. 2017; Jacobi et al. \n2017; Place et\
    \ al. 2012). In the agriculture sector, for \ninstance, while subsidies have spurred\
    \ productivity, \nthere are examples of perverse incentives that have led \nto\
    \ exploitation of groundwater and land resources. \nRecent reports explore agriculture\
    \ subsidies across the \nworld to identify opportunities to repurpose incentives\
    \ \nto achieve sustainable outcomes (Ding et al. 2021; FAO \net al. 2021 ). Improving\
    \ uptake and scaling of ToF \nsystems such as agroforestry through policies/schemes\
    \ \nrequires motivating farmers and other local \nstakeholders through easily\
    \ accessible monetary and \nnonmonetary incentives. \nAim of this study: Indian\
    \ policies/schemes on ToF \noffer a range of incentives such as input subsidies,\
    \ direct \npayments, grants, and technical support. A literature \nreview and\
    \ consultations with stakeholders indicate \nthere is a research gap on the types\
    \ of policy incentives \navailable, their scope and limitations, and \nimplementation\
    \ experiences of stakeholders.  \nAddressing key common challenges that individual\
    \ \nstates face and promoting cross-learning of best \npractices and failures\
    \ in the effective deployment of \nthese incentives emerges as critical learning\
    \ needed to \ndevelop a roadmap for scaling ToF. In this working \npaper we look\
    \ at six states (Gujarat, Karnataka, \nMaharashtra, Odisha, Punjab, and Telangana)\
    \ with \ndiverse geography and ToF systems. We reviewed \nnational and state-level\
    \ policies to identify the different \ntypes of incentives available and to examine\
    \ the \nenabling conditions and barriers that need to be \naddressed for scaling\
    \ ToF. We hope this study, which is \nthe first such on incentives offered by\
    \ national and \nstate-level ToF policies/schemes, will provide useful \ninput\
    \ to policymakers and decision-makers, restoration \nplanners and practitioners,\
    \ and NGOs.\n2. METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH\nFor the purpose of this study, we use\
    \ “policy” to refer to \nany act, rule, regulation, notification, circular, or\
    \ \ngovernment order enacted or issued by the national \nWORKING PAPER  |  March\
    \ 2022  |  7\nRoadmap for Scaling Trees outside Forests in India\nand/or state\
    \ governments that relates to ToF systems. \n“Scheme” refers to schemes, missions8,\
    \  or programs of \nthe national or state governments that support ToF \nsystems.\
    \ Our focus is on policies and schemes that are \ncurrently in force in the six\
    \ states we selected for our \ndeep-dive analysis. \nWe adopted a mixed-methods\
    \ approach for conducting \nthis study. The processes we followed are listed below:\n\
    \ ▪\nQuantitative analysis of fund allocation, release, and \nutilization for\
    \ policy/schemes \n ▪\nSecondary literature review of implementation \nexperience\
    \ \n ▪\nPrimary data collection through key informant \ninterviews (KIIs) with\
    \ 43 key stakeholders from \ngovernment, civil society, the private sector, and\
    \ \nfarmers. \n2.1 Selection of states\nWe selected the states of Gujarat, Karnataka,\
    \ \nMaharashtra, Odisha, Punjab, and Telangana based on \nthe following criteria\
    \ (see Figure 4): \n ▪\nFund allocation, release, and utilization \nunder SMAF:\
    \ SMAF is the government’s flagship \nmission for promoting ToF in India. The\
    \ details of \nfunds allotted, released, and utilized by the states \nare compiled\
    \ in an official database (NMSA n.d.).9 \nThe limitation we faced was that only\
    \ seven states \nprovided data on utilization of funds: Karnataka, \nAndhra Pradesh,\
    \ Odisha, Maharashtra, Mizoram, \nPunjab, and Chhattisgarh (NMSA n.d.). We selected\
    \ \nsix states that represent high-, medium-, and low-\nfund allocation, release,\
    \ and utilization (see Appen-\ndix C). \n ▪\nExtent of ToF: We selected a range\
    \ of states with \nhigh, medium, and low area under ToF to ensure we \ncould objectively\
    \ analyze best practices and chal-\nlenges. Given the variation in geographic\
    \ area (GA) \nof the states, the absolute area and ToF as a percent-\nage of GA\
    \ were considered (see Figure 2). \n ▪\nOther flagship policies on ToF: Taking\
    \ into \naccount the paucity in SMAF fund data, we looked \nat the experience\
    \ of states with policies/schemes for \nToF expansion, such as flagship state-level\
    \ schemes \nand history with promotion of traditional and mod-\nern ToF systems.\
    \ \n2.2 Analysis of policy incentives, enabling \nconditions, and barriers\nWe\
    \ created a list of national and state-level policies/\nschemes focusing on ToF\
    \ in the six selected states. \nWe compiled this list through a secondary literature\
    \ \nreview of government documents, including policies, \nacts, notifications,\
    \ circulars, orders, and amendments. \nWe reviewed 16 national and 30 state-level\
    \ policies/\nschemes/ programs (see Figure 5, Appendix D, Tables \nD1 and D2).\
    \ We conducted our review by developing \na framework to assess the policies and\
    \ identify the \nincentives offered (see Appendix E). We also reviewed \noperational\
    \ guidelines, progress reports, and financial \nreports from the government. We\
    \ backed this up with \na literature review (including peer reviews and grey \n\
    literature) using combinations of relevant search words \nin Google Scholar.10\
    \ Our populated framework identified \nthe different types of policy incentives\
    \ for promoting \nuptake and scaling of ToF, modality of delivery, institu-\n\
    tions/stakeholders involved, monitoring mechanisms, \nand other factors that supported\
    \ implementation of \nthe schemes. We noted any shortfalls or challenges in \n\
    funding and implementation to inform our checklist of \nquestions for the KIIs.\n\

    \ that could \nbe scaled, and challenges in the implementing or \navailing of\
    \ ToF incentives. The checklist/outline of these \nsemi-structured interviews\
    \ is provided in Appendix G. \nWe interviewed 43 stakeholders from different sectors\
    \ \n(see Figure 6). This included officials from the state \nnodal agency for\
    \ SMAF; Forest Department officials; \nHorticulture Department officials; Bamboo\
    \ Mission \nofficials; researchers from research organizations, state \nagriculture\
    \ universities, and the Central Agroforestry \nResearch Institute–Indian Council\
    \ of Agricultural \nResearch (CAFRI-ICAR); NGOs working closely with \nfarmers\
    \ for implementation of interventions; farmers \nimplementing ToF systems, particularly\
    \ agroforestry; \nand entrepreneurs involved in agroforestry and \nrestoration\
    \ businesses (See Figure 6). \nTypes of incentives for ToF: From the review of\
    \ \npolicy documents, we identified seven types of monetary \nand three types\
    \ of nonmonetary incentives embedded at\nthe national and state levels for supporting\
    \ expansion of \nToF. A few incentives such as minimum support price \n(MSP),\
    \ insurance, and supply chain infrastructure are \navailable only for limited\
    \ commercial ToF produce such \nas coconuts and select horticulture produce. This\
    \ nuance \nis highlighted in the Key Findings section below. Table 1 \nprovides\
    \ a snapshot of the policy instruments and the \nmodality of delivery of different\
    \ policy incentives.\n2.3 Key informant interviews\nWe interviewed key stakeholders\
    \ from the six states, as \nwell as experts and practitioners from other states\
    \ \nworking on innovative ToF projects (list of interviewees \nin Appendix F).\
    \ In these interviews, we focused on \nunderstanding their experience in implementing\
    \ various \n10  |  \nFigure 6  |   Institutional Affiliation of Stakeholders Consulted\

    \ not available to assess the temporal change in \nToF vis-à-vis implementation\
    \ of ToF policies/schemes. \nA causal connect cannot be made between the extent\
    \ of \nToF from FSI 2019 and the implementation of schemes. \nFor schemes such\
    \ as SMAF and NBM, information on \nbeneficiaries is restricted only to the number\
    \ of \nbeneficiaries and does not include details on the type of \nsocioeconomic\
    \ benefits obtained. \nDue to COVID-19-related travel restrictions, stakeholder\
    \ \ninterviews were conducted virtually over zoom and \ntelephone. Interviews\
    \ with farmers were supported by \nour partners. Action for Social Advancement\
    \ (ASA) \nconducted interviews with farmers in Gujarat, \nMaharashtra, and Odisha.\
    \ For Telangana, case studies \nfeaturing interviews with farmers practicing \n\
    agroforestry were shared by the Centre for People’s \nForestry. In Karnataka,\
    \ the Institution of Agroforestry \nFarmers and Technologists (IAFT) helped in\
    \ reaching \nout to farmers. \n4. KEY FINDINGS\nIn this section, we present findings\
    \ from the different \ntypes of policy incentives that exist for ToF as well as\
    \ a \ncomparative analysis of the experience of the six states \nin their implementation\
    \ of policies/schemes and \nincentives (see Appendix D, Tables D1 and D2). \n\
    3. LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY \nWe used the best publicly available and accessible\
    \ data \nfor this study and engaged with key stakeholders to \ncorroborate findings\
    \ and address gaps. The challenges \nwe faced can be broadly divided into three\
    \ categories—\ndata gaps, challenges in analyzing on-ground impact of \npolicies/schemes,\
    \ and pandemic-related disruptions. \nData on implementation of policies/schemes\
    \ such as \nactivities conducted, area covered, funds utilized, targets \nachieved,\
    \ and beneficiaries are not uniformly available \nand/or accessible across states.\
    \  We used the allocation, \nrelease, and utilization of funds from SMAF as a\
    \ proxy \nindicator to analyze the implementation progress of \nSMAF. We obtained\
    \ SMAF fund details from the \npublicly available database maintained by the National\
    \ \nMission on Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA). Though \nthe database is updated\
    \ regularly, the information is \nincomplete if states are unable to submit data\
    \ on time. \nThe sparse data that are currently available and \naccessible are\
    \ not suitable for analyzing the  impact of \nToF policies/schemes or their socioeconomic\
    \ benefits to \nlocal communities. One of the biggest challenges we \nfaced with\
    \ analyzing the “impact” of SMAF and other \npolicies/schemes, is the lack of\
    \ data on the increase in \nToF since the year of implementation. The Forest Survey\
    \ \nof India (FSI) analyzed the extent of ToF for the first \nWORKING PAPER  |\

    \ Overview of objectives and scope of the \npolicies/schemes\nToF systems supported\
    \ by policies/schemes:  \nThe policies/schemes we reviewed support a range of\
    \  \nToF systems such as agroforestry; linear plantations along \nroads, canals,\
    \ and rivers; home gardens with trees; trees in \nparks and gardens in urban areas;\
    \ and other urban forestry \ninterventions. The agroforestry interventions included\
    \ \ntrees on bunds and boundaries, agri-horti-forestry, and \nmonoculture and\
    \ mixed-species plantations in private and \npublic lands outside of Recorded\
    \ Forest Areas (RFAs) \nthrough block plantation, farm forestry, and fruit orchards.\
    \ \nAgroforestry emerged as the most supported ToF system, \nfollowed by linear\
    \ plantations (see Figure 7). Notably, we \nobserved that protection of traditional\
    \ ToF systems did  \nnot feature in the policies/schemes. \nStated objectives:\
    \ The key goals, priorities, and \nobjectives envisaged in policies/schemes that\
    \ were \nidentified through a review of the policy documents are \noutlined in\
    \ Figure 8. The size of the cell indicates the \nnumber of times a particular\
    \ goal is highlighted in the \npolicy/scheme.\nAs evidenced in Figure 8, the expansion\
    \ of tree cover \noutside forests and livelihood security emerged as the \nFigure\

    \ was \nmentioned only once. The “landscape approach” to \nplanning and implementing\
    \ ToF was not mentioned in \nthe reviewed policies/schemes and is a major gap.\
    \ In \nthe absence of a landscape approach, these policies/\nschemes fail to provide\
    \ multiple benefits or to integrate \na variety of stakeholders in the planning\
    \ process. \nMoreover, we observed that emphasis on gender \naspects is also lacking.\
    \ \n4.2 Overview of implementation experience of \nSMAF across the six states\
    \ \nAnalysis of policy incentives and budgets (2016–2020) \nshows that the implementation\
    \ modalities vary across \nthe six states (see Figure 9). The first year of \n\
    implementation of SMAF is taken as the year in which \nthe states enacted the\
    \ necessary relaxations in transit \nregulation. In four of the states selected\
    \ for this study, \nthe Forest Department is the nodal agency for \nimplementation\
    \ of SMAF. In Telangana and Odisha,  \nthe Horticulture Department and the Agriculture\
    \ and \nFarmers’ Empowerment Department are the nodal \ndepartments, respectively.\n\
    4.3 Comparative analysis of monetary and \nnonmonetary incentives \nAn overview\
    \ of key monetary and nonmonetary incentives \nbeing implemented in the six states\
    \ through the reviewed \nToF policies/schemes is outlined in Table 2. While most\
    \ \nstates have monetary and nonmonetary incentives for ToF, \nthe implementation\
    \ modalities are varied. We examine \nthese at length in the next few subsections.\

    4.3.1 Overview of subsidies across the six states \nOne of the most common monetary\
    \ incentives across \nthe six states is the input subsidy for seeds/saplings and\
    \ \nthe subsidy for infrastructure such as greenhouses and \nvermicomposting11\
    \ units. These incentives support ToF \nsystems like agroforestry, monoculture\
    \ or mixed-species \nplantations outside RFAs, and fruit orchards (see Table 3).\n\
    Further details of state-wise input subsidies are \nprovided in Appendix I.\n\
    4.3.2 Performance-based incentives\nMany states provide support to farmers for\
    \ protecting and \nmaintaining saplings for the first three years in the form\
    \ of \ndirect cash payments/transfers based on surviving saplings. \nSurvival\
    \ rates are monitored manually through site visits. \nThis incentive is applicable\
    \ to agroforestry interventions \nsuch as trees on bunds and alley cropping, among\
    \ others, \nand monoculture and mixed-species plantations outside \nRFAs. The\
    \ SMAF allows states to provide performance-\nbased subsidies covering 50 percent\

    \ \nof assistance based on survival of saplings. Figure 10 \nprovides details\
    \ of the implementation of this incentive in \nsix states. \n4.3.3 Grants\nThe\
    \ grants available for ToF are provided by NABARD’s \nTribal Development Fund\
    \ (TDF), the Rashtriya Krishi \nVikas Yojana (RKVY) for agroforestry, and the\
    \ 15th \nFinance Commission. See Appendix I for further details. \nNABARD has\
    \ been instrumental in providing grants for \nestablishing the wadi model of agroforestry\
    \ (see Figure \n11 and Appendix J). \n4.3.4 Credit\nAmong our six selected states,\
    \ only Gujarat implements \na credit-linked loan under the Adivasi Vruksh Kheti\
    \ \nScheme, which incentivizes tribal farmers to adopt \nplantations of high-value\
    \ tree crops (see Appendix I).\nThe Punjab Horticulture Department offers a credit-\n\
    linked back-ended subsidy for plantation \ninfrastructure development and for\
    \ establishment of \nmarketing infrastructure for horticulture produce. These\
    \ \nexperiences have been difficult to assess due to paucity \nof data. However,\
    \ stakeholders consulted from Punjab \nindicated that the credit-linked back-ended\
    \ subsidies \ndid not yield good results. There needs to be further \nexamination\
    \ and assessment to arrive at an \nunderstanding of why the state is not seeing\
    \ the \nintended result. The National Bamboo Mission (NBM),\nthrough financial\
    \ institutions, provides a credit-linked \nback-ended subsidy through financial\
    \ institutions, \nincluding banks.12 We were unable to assess the \nexperience\
    \ of farmers in the availing of this subsidy due \nto lack of data across states.\n\

    In this area we contended with scarce data on funds \navailable under the National\
    \ Biodiversity Fund, State \nBiodiversity Fund, and funds with biodiversity \n\
    management committees.13 Details of benefit-sharing \nagreements and utilization\
    \ of funds are also sparse, with \nonly the Telangana State Biodiversity Board\
    \ reporting \nmore than 20 access and benefit-sharing agreements \nand INR 406,200\
    \ received into the State Biodiversity \nFund (TSBB n.d.). \n4.3.6 Insurance\n\
    In Karnataka and Maharashtra, insurance for select \nannual horticulture crops\
    \ exists (see Appendix I for \nfurther details). There are three insurance companies—\n\
    United India Insurance, Agriculture Insurance Company \nof India, and Oriental\
    \ Insurance Company—that provide \ntree insurance for agroforestry systems.14\
    \ Our literature \nreview and consultation with stakeholders showed that \nnone\
    \ of the six states provides or avails of this type of \nagroforestry tree insurance.\n\
    4.3.7 Minimum support price\nAmong commercial plantation species, minimum \nsupport\
    \ price (MSP) was declared for mature de-husked \ncoconuts for the 2020 season.\
    \ Earlier, MSP was only \navailable for milling copra (processed and dried coconut\
    \ \nused for oil extraction). This made it inaccessible for \nsmall and marginal\
    \ farmers who are unable to hold \nmature coconuts in storage and have insufficient\
    \ facility \nfor copra making (MoAFW 2020). MSP is not provided \nfor any other\
    \ ToF produce—including timber and \nnontimber produce. \n4.3.8 Supply chain infrastructure\n\

    \ \nPOLICIES/SCHEMES AND INCENTIVES \nFOR EXPANDING TOF\nOur analysis of policy\
    \ implementation experience in the \nsix states highlighted the following factors\
    \ or conditions \nWORKING PAPER  |  March 2022  |  19\nRoadmap for Scaling Trees\
    \ outside Forests in India\nthat underpinned effective implementation and \npromoted\
    \ uptake of ToF systems such as agroforestry.\n5.1 Political and bureaucratic\
    \ will\nThe states’ political and bureaucratic commitment to \nincreasing tree\
    \ cover is a key factor in encouraging \nfarmers and other stakeholders to adopt\
    \ ToF. States \nincluding Telangana and Maharashtra are implementing \nmassive\
    \ schemes such as the Telanganaku Haritha \nHaram (THH) and Mission Plantation,\
    \ respectively, \nwhich emphasize ToF (GoT n.d; Maharashtra Forest \nDepartment\
    \ n.d.). Similarly, Punjab has accelerated its \nefforts to increase tree cover\
    \ by linking tree-based \nrestoration with the celebration of anniversaries of\
    \ \nreligious icons.16 Other states such as Karnataka have \nflagship missions\
    \ like the KAPY to support agroforestry. \nSuch schemes have showcased pathways\
    \ in which \ndifferent government departments such as forests, \nagriculture,\
    \ horticulture, tribal welfare, water, and rural \ndevelopment can work together\
    \ for achieving ToF goals. \nThere are concerns over the myopic focus of such\
    \ \nschemes on tree plantation without an emphasis on \nfollowing ecological principles\
    \ in planning. We explore \nthese concerns in the next section.  \n5.2 Convergence\
    \ of state-level schemes with \nother national schemes/policies\nThe state-level\
    \ ToF schemes have successfully \ndovetailed funds from other national policies/schemes\
    \ \nsuch as the MGNREGS. In Karnataka, implementation \nof KAPY converges funds\
    \ from the MGNREGS and the \nPradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY). \n\
    Schemes in Telangana also leverage MGNREGS for \ncovering charges related to pitting,\
    \ planting, and \nsetting-up of nurseries. In Maharashtra, different \ndepartments\
    \ including the Agriculture Department used \nMGNREGS funds to complete activities\
    \ for Mission \nPlantation (PCCF [SF] Maharashtra 2020). Punjab, \nGujarat, and\
    \ Odisha also leveraged MGNREGS for ToF \nactivities. \n5.3 Decentralizing and\
    \ farmer-focused \nimplementation of ToF\nSeveral states have decentralized the\
    \ implementation of \nToF schemes to the panchayat level to ensure healthy \n\
    survival rates and flow of benefits directly to local \ncommunities.17 For instance,\
    \ in Telangana, as per the \namendment made to Telangana Panchayat Raj Act 2018,\
    \  \ngram panchayats are accountable for maintaining at \nleast 85 percent survival\
    \ of the plantations in each \nvillage. The Karnataka State Bamboo Mission conducts\
    \ \nconsultations with farmers to identify areas where \npaddy cultivation has\
    \ become uneconomical and lands \nthat have turned alkaline due to continuous\
    \ cultivation \nof sugarcane. This approach has ensured sustained \ninterest from\
    \ farmers, along with ecological restoration \nof degraded areas (APCCF [NFAP\
    \ and Bamboo Mission] \nKarnataka 2020). All the states reported some type of\
    \ \nprocess for farmers to register with the responsible \ndepartment (usually\
    \ the Forest Department) for their \ndesired tree species for seed and sapling\
    \ production. \nGovernment officials reported higher survival rates \nwhen farmers\
    \ are allowed to choose their preferred tree \nspecies. \n5.4 Partnership with\
    \ nongovernmental \norganizations\nState governments and other government institutions\
    \ \nhave partnered with NGOs for building capacity and \nsupporting farmers to\
    \ successfully avail of policy \nincentives. In Telangana, under the Sustainable\
    \ \nManagement of Tree in Cotton Production in Wetland \nForest Ecosystem project,\
    \ farmers were supported with \nplanting of saplings and site preparation by the\
    \ NGO, \nthe Centre for People’s Forestry (CPF 2020).18 The wadi \nmodel spearheaded\
    \ by NABARD is an important \nexample that highlights the role of NGOs in capacity-\n\
    building and extension support. This is a vital resource, \nespecially in terms\
    \ of selection of the most appropriate \nagroforestry model and in the organization\
    \ of farmers \ninto farmer groups or self-help groups (SHGs) \n(Brockington et\
    \ al. 2016). \n5.5 Role of research institutions\nState agriculture universities\
    \ conduct research and \ndemonstrate different agroforestry models to identify\
    \ \neconomically viable models that can be scaled to \nfarmers. The Navsari Agricultural\
    \ University (NAU) in \nGujarat, for instance, has developed 17 agroforestry \n\
    models and techniques, of which five to six have been \nadopted by farmers (Tandel\
    \ 2020). In Odisha, the \nWorld Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF) implemented \ndifferent\
    \ agroforestry systems to improve nutritional \nsecurity and water availability\
    \ for local communities in \npartnership with the state government19 (Rizvi et\
    \ al. \n2020). State agriculture universities and other research \norganizations\
    \ often collaborate with the Indian Council \nof Agricultural Research–Central\
    \ Agroforestry Research \nInstitute (ICAR-CAFRI),  which has 37 centers across\
    \ \n20  |  \nIndia. CAFRI has developed over 50 agroforestry \nmodels based on\
    \ the agroclimatic regions. It has also \ndeveloped a “FarmTree” app that provides\
    \ information \non 20 agroforestry tree species and their management \npractices\
    \ (Ram 2020).20\n5.6 Established value chains and private sector \npartnerships\n\
    ToF systems can be most effectively sustained in areas \nwith established links\
    \ to markets or the industry. For \ninstance, the Karnataka State Bamboo Mission\
    \ has \nmade efforts to revive bamboo value chains by \nestablishing holistic\
    \ linkages. In the past, farmers \nmoved away from bamboo plantations due to dwindling\
    \ \ndemand for bamboo, compounded by the migration of \nbamboo artisans toward\
    \ other employment \nopportunities.  The State Bamboo Mission set up \nnurseries\
    \ for supplying planting material, rehabilitated \nbamboo artisans, linked farmers\
    \ with artisans, and \nestablished common processing centers to revitalize the\
    \ \nentire value chain (APCCF [NFAP and Bamboo Mission] \nKarnataka 2020).21\n\
    The private sector plays an important role in supporting \nfarmers through technical\
    \ capacity-building, value \nchains development, and linkages for an improved\
    \ \nmarket environment.22 Some farmers have also entered \ninto buy-back arrangements\
    \ with mills, ensuring \nsustained markets for their produce (Tandel 2020). \n\
    5.7 Innovative business models around ToF\nInnovative private business models\
    \ exist, such as Araku \nCoffee. Naandi Foundation supported tribal \ncommunities\
    \ with financial, technical, and market \nlinkages in the Araku Valley to establish\
    \ agroforestry \nsystems with coffee and horticulture trees to rehabilitate \n\
    the land and strengthen the livelihood of the \ncommunities (Naandi Foundation\
    \ n.d.). Surat-based \ncompany Sparkle manufactures sanitary pads from \nlocally\
    \ sourced bamboo, banana fibre, and corn starch, \nthus supporting farmers with\
    \ extra income (Sparkle \nn.d.). Another example is Black Baza Coffee, which is\
    \ \nsustainably produced (see Appendix K).\n5.8 Monitoring\nExpanding ToF requires\
    \ not only the uptake of \ninterventions but ensuring the survival and proper\
    \ \nmaintenance of trees. The six states had mechanisms in \nplace for the respective\
    \ governments to monitor the \nprogress of restoration and/or expansion. For instance,\
    \ \nas part of its Mission Plantation, the Maharashtra Forest \nDepartment hosts\
    \ the GPS location and images of \nplanted saplings on its portal. In Telangana,\
    \ a state-level \ncommittee headed by the chief secretary ensures \ncoordination\
    \ among the different government \ndepartments to implement plantation activities\
    \ and \nmonitor survival rates and outreach (PCCF [SF] \nTelangana 2020).23 However,\
    \ we emphasize that \nrestoration is a long-term process that can lead to many\
    \ \nbenefits for people and the environment. Monitoring \nmechanisms need to incorporate\
    \ inclusive indicators \nsuch as biodiversity, water flow, soil health, jobs,\
    \ and \nlivelihoods in addition to the survival rate of saplings to \nassess the\
    \ progress of ToF projects. The states we \nstudied did not have inclusive monitoring\
    \ mechanisms \nthat involved local communities/citizens or that \nmonitored biophysical\
    \ and socioeconomic benefits of \nrestoration. \n5.9 Interest of farmers to shift\
    \ to agroforestry \nsystems \nStakeholder interviews with farmers showed they\
    \ have a \nstrong understanding of the benefits of agroforestry. \nFarmers in\
    \ Karnataka cited the resilience of agroforestry \nsystems to drought. Trees on\
    \ farmlands can check soil \nerosion, increase soil moisture content, and improve\
    \ \ngroundwater retention. In rainfed systems, these \nbenefits increase the productivity\
    \ of the land. Trees also \nensure farmers have alternate income sources through\
    \ \nthe sale of tree produce. This is a key benefit that is \nsignificant to farmers\
    \ in rainfed areas. In Maharashtra, \nfarmers highlighted improvement in microclimate,\
    \ soil \nhealth, erosion control, and the use of trees as field \nshelterbelts\
    \ that do not compete with nearby crops. \nFarmers in Odisha and Gujarat noted\
    \ improvement in \nsoil health and water quality as key potential benefits. \n\
    All farmers acknowledged the monetary benefits from \ntrees in the long term.\
    \ Farmers highlighted training and \nworkshops organized by the Forest Department\
    \ and/or \nthe Agriculture Department, and peer-to-peer learning \nas key factors\
    \ that motivated them to take up \nagroforestry.  \n6. BARRIERS THAT IMPEDE THE\
    \ UPTAKE \nOF TOF \nOur analysis of implementation experience through \nstakeholder\
    \ consultations highlighted gaps in existing \nincentives and the need to design\
    \ customized incentives \nto suit local contexts. Several of these gaps arise\
    \ due to \nthe lack of a landscape approach in planning ToF \nWORKING PAPER  |\
    \  March 2022  |  21\nRoadmap for Scaling Trees outside Forests in India\nactivities.\
    \ The barriers impede effectiveness of ToF \npolicies and incentives.\n6.1 Lack\
    \ of incentives for existing ToF and \ntraditional practices\nThe policies/schemes\
    \ we reviewed for this study do not \ncontain incentives for farmers to maintain\
    \ existing ToF \nsystems, particularly for native trees. The policies/\nschemes\
    \ overlook protection and maintenance of \nhealthy ToF, which is a key tenet of\
    \ the landscape \napproach. For instance, our interview with a farmer \npracticing\
    \ agroforestry in the Dakshina Kannada region \n(adjacent to the Western Ghats)\
    \ highlighted the growing \nchanges to this landscape, where farmers are \nincreasingly\
    \ planting clonal, monoculture trees due to \nbetter policy support (Bhatt 2021).\
    \ Monetary incentives, \nmarket linkages, and public-private partnerships are\
    \ \ncurrently focused on setting up new ToF systems with \nfast-growing clonal\
    \ species, which disincentivizes \nmaintenance and restoration of native species.\
    \ These \nconcerns were also seen in Gujarat, Maharashtra, \nOdisha, and Telangana\
    \ where plantation schemes \nprioritize fast-growing species. \n6.2 Lack of extension\
    \ services for supporting \nfarmers\nKey stakeholders expressed that there are\
    \ gaps in \nextension services, and farmers lack the bundling of \npractices (land\
    \ development; planting and maintenance \nof trees on farmlands; harvesting, processing,\
    \ and \nconnection to industries or markets) required for \nmanaging the tree/crop\
    \ interface in ToF systems. Krishi \nVigyan Kendras (KVKs) support initiatives\
    \ for improving \nthe agricultural economy of districts and link the National\
    \ \nAgriculture Research System with extension system and \nfarmers. KVKs often\
    \ do not have enough members with \nagroforestry knowledge, and in the absence\
    \ of training for \nKVK workers, they are unable to build capacity and \nawareness\
    \ among farmers (ICFRE 2020). A majority of \nfarmers are hesitant to adopt agroforestry\
    \ since the \nimpact of agroforestry on income in the short and \nmedium terms\
    \ is difficult to manage. This demotivates \nfarmers and negatively impacts their\
    \ income.\n6.3 Lack of quality planting material and \nstandards \nFarmers highlighted\
    \ the lack of good planting material \nas a key challenge to practicing agroforestry\
    \ (More \n2021). Despite the focus of states on establishing \nnurseries for production\
    \ of quality planting material, we \nobserved continuing challenges with the cost\
    \ and quality \nof seedlings.24 Stakeholders interviewed from the state \nsaid\
    \ farmers procure seedlings from private agencies at \nhigh rates, which are not\
    \ subject to quality control \nprocedures (APCCF [SF] Karnataka 2018).  The \n\
    unregulated nature of private nurseries and use of \nnonscientific methods for\
    \ producing planting material \nwas a common thread among our stakeholder \ninterviewers\
    \ and also in our literature review (CAFRI-\nICAR 2019). The incentive structure\
    \ around input \nsubsidy is also under debate. During stakeholder \ninterviews\
    \ (both government and NGOs), it emerged \nthat a 100 percent subsidy on planting\
    \ material is \nsuboptimal and leads to wastage of seedlings. \nExperience shows\
    \ that a practice of setting nominal \nrates for seedlings for public distribution\
    \ fosters a better \nsense of ownership among beneficiaries and leads to \nbetter\
    \ results. \n6.4 Poor awareness and access to existing policy \nincentives\nStakeholder\
    \ interviews showed that though different \ntypes of monetary incentives are available\
    \ in the six \nstates, only input subsidies (particularly subsidies for \nplanting\
    \ material) emerged as the most widely known \nand accessible incentive. The input\
    \ subsidy was availed \nof by 7 out of 13 farmers interviewed, with others \n\
    acknowledging the existence of the subsidy. Among \nother monetary incentives,\
    \ performance-based cash \ntransfers and MSP were highlighted by farmers as \n\
    important for scaling agroforestry. However, very few \nfarmers were aware of\
    \ the specific schemes in their \nstates, and none had accessed these benefits.\
    \  Farmers \nwere also largely unaware of insurance schemes. In \nMaharashtra,\
    \ where insurance was available for \nhorticulture crops, the interviews with\
    \ farmers growing \norange trees showed that the insurance schemes were \nnot\
    \ feasible for small farmers operating less than 2 ha of \nland as the payment\
    \ of premiums is unaffordable for \nthem (Saheb 2021). \n6.5 Knowledge gaps on\
    \ ToF models and tree \nspecies\nThough many stakeholders are involved in the\
    \ research \non ToF models in the six states, there are two key gaps \nthat prevent\
    \ effective translation of research into wider \nadoption on the ground:  \n ▪\n\
    Experts from research institutions noted that even \nwhen ToF models are developed,\
    \ there are con-\nstraints in replication and scaling that are driven by \n22\
    \  |  \nthe absence of seed-to-market considerations and \ninadequate channels\
    \ to engage with farmers and \nguide them through the process. \n ▪\nThere is\
    \ a knowledge gap on traditional ToF sys-\ntems practiced in different agroclimatic\
    \ zones of \nthe country. There is little or no information on the \nextent of\
    \ these practices or the status of dependent \npopulations. There are also gaps\
    \ in understanding \nof the impact of traditional systems on the flow of \necosystem\
    \ services and benefits, such as biodiver-\nsity conservation; improved soil and\
    \ water; and \nimproved access to food, fuelwood, fodder, and \nnontimber forest\
    \ produce (NTFP). \n6.6 Gaps in regulatory environment \nStakeholders in all of\
    \ the states noted that regulatory \nbottlenecks deter them from adopting ToF\
    \ models \ndespite the enabling policies/schemes for scaling ToF \n(ICFRE 2020;\
    \ TERI 2020; Sharma et al. 2017). Though \nthere is an emphasis on easing the\
    \ process of exempting \nspecific tree species from felling/harvest and transit\
    \ \nregulations, state-level differences in policy and legal \nambiguities create\
    \ conflicts in transporting farm-grown \ntimber across the state line.  There\
    \ is also ambiguity in \ndifferentiating between products (both timber and \n\
    nontimber) obtained from forest and nonforest areas \nthat are controlled by different\
    \ permit regimes \n(Bhushan 2018). For instance, while transit permits are \n\
    not required for farm-grown bamboo, they are still \nrequired for forest-grown\
    \ bamboo. The differences in \nthe list of exempted timber and NTFP (bark, leaves,\
    \ \nflowers, gum, resin, etc.) between states also pose  a \ncritical challenge\
    \ for farmers. Such regulatory intricacies \nand barriers discourage uptake of\
    \ ToF by farmers.  \n6.7 Inadequate attention to land tenure and tree \ntenure\n\
    Studies show that farmers are more likely to adopt and \nreap benefits from agroforestry\
    \ if they have long-term, \nsecure tenure to land and access to resources that\
    \ grow \nin it (Ahmad et al. 2019). Tree tenure consists of a \nbundle of rights\
    \ over trees and their produce, which may \nbe held by different people at different\
    \ times. In India, \nvarious estimates show that nearly 35 percent of India’s\
    \ \nagricultural land is cultivated by tenant farmers who \nnumber an approximate\
    \ 25 million rural households.  \nThey are unable to access benefits, incentives,\
    \ and \nservices due to legal limitations (Patnaik 2016). This is \nparticularly\
    \ true in the case of agroforestry, since tenant \nfarmers can neither access\
    \ incentives/benefits nor claim \nownership of trees due to lack of tree tenure.\
    \ The \nNational Agroforestry Policy 2014 recognizes secure \nland tenure and\
    \ tree tenure for tenant farmers as a \nnecessary condition for farmers to take\
    \ up agroforestry, \ngiven the long gestation period and capital and labor \n\
    investment needed (GoI 2014). However, the six states, \nmuch like the rest of\
    \ India, have lagged in fulfilling the \npolicy’s call for creating an enabling\
    \ environment \nbacked by legislation for land and tree tenure and \ndeveloping\
    \ management information systems for \nagroforestry with sound land records (GoI\
    \ 2014). \n6.8 Poor consideration around gender and social \ninclusion\nWomen\
    \ are central to ToF systems, especially since they \nare the primary practitioners\
    \ of interventions, such as \nhome gardens. For women, low land ownership and\
    \ lack \nof recognition as farmers imperils their contribution to \nToF. Among\
    \ the states analyzed, women operated \nbetween 1 percent (Punjab) and 22 percent\
    \ (Telangana) \nof agricultural lands. Women and other marginal \ngroups, such\
    \ as Scheduled Caste (SC) and Scheduled \nTribe (ST) populations, are heavily\
    \ dependent on trees \nfor fuelwood, fodder, NTFP models, and food.  While \n\
    several policies/schemes contained incentives for \nwomen and Scheduled Caste/Scheduled\
    \ Tribe \npopulations,25 there is lack of focus on the differentiated \nneeds\
    \ of these marginalized populations in terms of tree \nspecies preference, subsistence\
    \ and provisioning needs, \nand other regulatory services (soil, water, etc.).\
    \ Our \nresearch also showed that ToF in the six states \npredominantly focused\
    \ on timber and commercial ToF \nproducts. The role of ToF in improving food and\
    \ \nnutritional security, especially for women and \nmarginalized sections, has\
    \ not received adequate \nattention. \n6.9 Lack of an enabling environment in\
    \ ToF \nmarkets \nThe long gestational period for trees and the absence of \n\
    safety nets such as minimum support price and \ninsurance deter farmers from adopting\
    \ ToF systems. \nMany ToF products (timber and nontimber) suffer from \nlack of\
    \ value chains, market linkages, viable business \nmodels, and marketing infrastructure\
    \ for agroforestry \nproduce (ICFRE 2020; Chavan et al. 2015). Consultation \n\
    with stakeholders and farmers from the six states \nshowed that most of them were\
    \ dependent on local \ntraders and informal networks for the sale of ToF \nproduce.\
    \ Even among established wood-based \nindustries, such as furniture, plywood,\
    \ handicrafts, etc., \nWORKING PAPER  |  March 2022  |  23\nRoadmap for Scaling\
    \ Trees outside Forests in India\nvalue chains remain informal or “unorganized”\
    \ (NCCF \n2021; Bhatt 2021). This makes it difficult to expand \nmarkets and build\
    \ business models (Gautam 2020).26 \n6.10 Lack of a landscape approach in restoration\
    \ \nplans\nThe large-scale plantation drives by states present \necological and\
    \ social challenges due to poor landscape \nconsiderations, such as the planting\
    \ of ecologically \ninappropriate species, saplings replacing naturally \noccurring\
    \ shrubs and ground vegetation, poorly planned \nriverine plantations, and lack\
    \ of involvement of local \ncommunities in planning (Sarfaraz and Shrangi 2020;\
    \ \nEJAtlas n.d.). The plantation schemes with a singular \nfocus on tree planting\
    \ fail to recognize the significance \nof natural ecosystems such as grasslands,\
    \ natural open \nforests, scrublands, and other fragile ecosystems. Our \nconsultations\
    \ with the NGOs working with farmers also \nrevealed that these plantation schemes\
    \ often reduce the \navailability of planting material for farmers (Reddy et al.\
    \ \n2020). Though many state schemes, such as the THH, \nemphasized the involvement\
    \ of gram panchayats and \nlocal communities, there have been instances of conflict\
    \ \nbetween the Forest Department and local communities, \nparticularly in tribal\
    \ areas, over land tenure and \n resource rights (Rupavath 2020). \n7. RECOMMENDATIONS\
    \ \nOur findings highlight that states have implemented \nmonetary and nonmonetary\
    \ incentives in multiple ways. \nThere are best practices that can be adopted\
    \ by other \nstates; however, there are also critical gaps that need to \nbe addressed\
    \ to scale ToF to the level envisaged by the \nschemes/policies. We recommend\
    \ developing \nrestoration strategies using a landscape approach, \nreorienting\
    \ or shifting incentives to suit the local \ncontext, and strengthening the enabling\
    \ environment \nfor strengthening incentives (see Figure 15). Based on \nour analysis,\
    \ the following recommendations emerge as \npivotal in supporting India’s ToF\
    \ goals.\n ▪\nDevelop restoration plans and strategies \nusing a landscape approach\
    \ at state and \ndistrict levels that considers multiple land uses, \necosystem\
    \ service needs, and priorities of local \ncommunities. Decision-makers and planners\
    \ can \nuse the restoration plans to converge ToF activities \nunder various policies/schemes\
    \ for multiple benefits, \nincluding food security, provisioning of fuelwood/\n\
    fodder, carbon sequestration, and income generation. \n ▪\n There is a need for\
    \ designing incentives to pro-\ntect existing ToF and to promote traditional \n\
    ToF models with native species. There is scope \nto explore incentives such as\
    \ payment for ecosys-\ntem services that can motivate farmers to take up \nthese\
    \ practices. \n ▪\nImprove, standardize, and customize input \nsubsidies, which\
    \ are the most commonly \navailable and availed of incentive. The sub-\nsidies\
    \ for planting materials will be successful in \nincreasing uptake of ToF systems\
    \ if quality controls \nand standards are established for developing plant-\n\

    \ \nINCENTIVES\n1.\n2.\n3.\n24  |  \ning materials and setting up nurseries. Institutions\
    \ \nsuch as the CAFRI-ICAR, ICRAF, and Tamil Nadu \nAgricultural University (TNAU)\
    \ have developed \nsuch standards. Additionally, capacity-building \nfor development\
    \ of decentralized communi-\nty-based nurseries can develop saplings suited to\
    \ \nlocal needs. \n ▪\nProvide policy and financial support to \nNGOs and research\
    \ institutions to spur ToF \nuptake. The study highlights the key role of NGOs\
    \ \nand extension workers in bridging the gap between \nstate government departments\
    \ and on-the-ground \npractitioners by creating awareness of incentives, \nsupporting\
    \ farmers to avail of these incentives, \nand providing technical support for\
    \ implementa-\ntion. NABARD’s wadi program is a stellar example \nof modalities\
    \ to include NGOs in ToF initiatives. \nMonetary incentives such as grants can\
    \ be \nreoriented to include provisions to involve \nother partners such as NGOs\
    \ or research \ninstitutions.  \n ▪\nProvide incentives such as minimum sup-\n\
    port price (MSP) for timber and nontimber \nToF produce and supply chain infrastruc-\n\
    ture, which are currently available for only \nlimited commercial and horticulture\
    \ pro-\nduce. There is a need to expand these to include \nToF species. For instance,\
    \ the Tribal Cooperative \nMarketing Development Federation of India \n(TRIFED)\
    \ is implementing the Mechanism for Mar-\nketing of Minor Forest Produce through\
    \ Minimum \nSupport Price (MSP for MFP) and development of a \nvalue chain scheme\
    \ with state government agencies \nacross 21 states of the country (MoTA 2021).27\
    \   \n ▪\nTree insurance for ToF systems needs to be \npromoted with payment mechanisms\
    \ that \nare attractive and viable for farmers. There \nare successful models\
    \ that can be replicated. For \ninstance, TNAU has worked out a model whereby\
    \ \nindustries with buy-back arrangements with farm-\ners are paying the full\
    \ amount of the premium on \nbehalf of the farmers (Parthiban 2020).28 \n ▪\n\
    Develop innovative mechanisms for deliver-\ning nonmonetary incentives. There\
    \ is scope to \nshare research on ToF systems and create or scale \ndedicated\
    \ extension services and helplines (within \nor outside of KVK), particularly\
    \ for agroforestry in \neach state. Mobile support services can be offered \n\
    to farmers to sustain and benefit from ToF systems \n(ICFRE 2020; Parthiban 2020).\
    \ This should be \nsupported through regular capacity-building, \npeer-to-peer\
    \ learning, and technical training \nof extension service workers on ToF models\
    \ and tree \nspecies, planting techniques, maintenance activities, \nharvesting,\
    \ and value-addition.  \n ▪\nDevise policy instruments to secure land \nand tree\
    \ tenure. This is fundamental in motivat-\ning local actors to implement ToF systems\
    \ (ICFRE \n2020). Similar to the prerequisite of relaxation in \ntimber transit\
    \ regulations, the government can \nmandate states to notify of appropriate land\
    \ and \ntree tenure rules as per the National Agroforestry \nPolicy 2014 to help\
    \ farmers access funds from the \nSMAF and develop modalities to ensure the flow\
    \ of \nbenefits from ToF to women and tenant farmers. \n ▪\nBuild innovative business\
    \ and restoration \nmodels. There are many innovative businesses and \nentrepreneurs\
    \ combining livelihoods and welfare \nof farmers with the successful sale of ToF\
    \ products. \nThere are interesting examples of incubators and \naccelerator programs\
    \ that build capacity and sup-\nport entrepreneurs to grow their ToF businesses.29\
    \ \nScaling existing incubators and accelerators \nand improving incentives for\
    \ restoration \nentrepreneurs can galvanize ToF entrepreneur-\nship, business\
    \ models, and implementation on the \nground.  \n ▪\nFactor the needs of local\
    \ population, women, \nand marginalized communities in planning \nfor ToF. These\
    \ groups are very often the primary \nimplementers and beneficiaries of ToF expansion.\
    \ \nOur consultations and literature review show that \nwomen and other marginal\
    \ groups prioritize native \nspecies and diverse tree systems that can pro-\n\
    vide multiple benefits.  Scalable examples such as \nNABARD’s wadi model for small\
    \ tribal farmers and \nwomen-led agroforestry interventions exist. There is \n\
    a need to integrate these lessons learned to shift or \nreorient existing incentives\
    \ to support women, SC/\nST, and small/marginal farmers to take up ToF.  \n ▪\n\
    Strengthen blended finance–private sector \nmodels such as linking of farmers\
    \ to industries \nthat can procure ToF products; corporate social \nresponsibility\
    \ (CSR) funds for restoration; and car-\nbon finance and payments for ecosystem\
    \ services, \nwhich in turn can help finance ToF. These blended \nWORKING PAPER\
    \  |  March 2022  |  25\nRoadmap for Scaling Trees outside Forests in India\n\
    finance models can be built by exploring the poten-\ntial for forming business\
    \ consortiums (e.g., TNAU \nConsortium of Industrial Agroforestry), increasing\
    \ \ndemand for ToF from industries, building capacity \nfor the private sector\
    \ to invest in ToF, and increas-\ning awareness of consumers on ToF produce. Other\
    \ \npathways such as carbon finance for agroforestry \ncan also be explored to\
    \ identify gaps from previous \nexperience with such projects and to develop guide-\n\
    lines with strong social and ecological safeguards for \nfuture projects.  \n\
    \ ▪\nDevelop certification standards to overcome \nlegal conflicts related to\
    \ transit of farm-\ngrown timber. This can strengthen accountability \nand traceability\
    \ of ToF produce. Certifications for \ntimber from agroforestry using international\
    \ bench-\nmarking of existing management practices and \nlegal/statutory compliances\
    \ can provide farmers \nadditional avenues for sustainable timber trading. \n\
    There are also opportunities to certify nontimber \nservices of ToF systems, including\
    \ criteria for  \ncertification of the flow of ecosystem services such \nas water,\
    \ soil health, carbon, and biodiversity can \nhelp in achieving the twin objectives\
    \ of ToF—to \nimprove the livelihoods of local communities and  \nto enhance the\
    \ environment. There is potential  \nfor developing criteria and indicators (C&I)\
    \ for \nmanagement of agroforestry systems similar to  \nthe C&I available for\
    \ sustainable management of \nnatural forests in India. \n ▪\nCreate inclusive\
    \ monitoring mechanisms for \nthe progress of ToF interventions along with \n\
    the flow of benefits, challenges, and success \nstories. Comprehensive systems\
    \ should be evolved \nthat include wider restoration indicators such as \nimprovement\
    \ in soil, water, biodiversity, and carbon \nsequestration; and increase income\
    \ and livelihoods. \nThe use of inclusive monitoring mechanisms that \nleverage\
    \ citizen science approaches and involve local \ncommunities in the monitoring\
    \ process can lead to \nthe creation of accurate and accessible data. Includ-\n\
    ing such monitoring strategies in policies and devel-\noping platforms to make\
    \ the information accessible, \naccurate, and reliable can support scaling of\
    \ ToF \nimplementation in India and record progress against \ninternational climate\
    \ and development targets.\n26  |  \nAPPENDIX A. EXPERIENCE \nIMPLEMENTING THE\
    \ NATIONAL \nMISSION FOR A GREEN INDIA AND \nMAHATMA GANDHI NATIONAL RURAL \n\
    EMPLOYMENT GUARANTEE SCHEME FOR \nAGROFORESTRY AND TREES OUTSIDE \nFORESTS\nImplementation\
    \ experience of National Mission for a \nGreen India (GIM) and the Mahatma Gandhi\
    \ National \nRural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) are \nimportant to discuss,\
    \ given their significance for expan-\nsion of trees outside forests (ToF) in\
    \ India.\nAs one of the eight missions outlined under the National \nAction Plan\
    \ for Climate Change, GIM aims to increase \nforest cover by 5 million hectares\
    \ (Mha), improve the \nquality of existing forest on another 5 Mha of land, \n\
    enhance ecosystem services, and improve forest-based \nlivelihoods for 3 million\
    \ households. The activities \nunder GIM include several ToF interventions such\
    \ as \nagroforestry; restoration of abandoned mine areas; \nravine reclamation;\
    \ linear plantations along roads, \nriver, bunds, and canals; and restoration\
    \ of wetlands. \nGIM became operational in 2015–2016, and until the \nyear 2017–2018,\
    \ a budget of INR 1.6 billion has been \nallocated (MoEFCC 2019). Although GIM\
    \ includes an \nambitious climate change mitigation and adaptation \nplan, the\
    \ 2018 Parliamentary Committee report out-\nlined the major challenges with GIM,\
    \ for instance, the \ninadequate budget allocation. Budget allocation of INR \n\
    478 million for 2017–2018 was grossly insufficient \ncompared to the committed\
    \ liability of FY 2015 and FY \n2016 of INR 895 million (MoEFCC 2019). The 2018\
    \ \nParliamentary Committee emphasized that afforestation \ndone under GIM needs\
    \ to have a holistic view with focus \non multiple ecosystem services, especially\
    \ biodiversity, \nwater, biomass, and preserving mangroves, wetlands, \ncritical\
    \ habitats, etc., along with carbon sequestration \nas a cobenefit. The committee\
    \ also cautioned against \nplantations of trees like eucalyptus without considering\
    \ \nsoil and weather conditions.\nThe Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employ-\n\
    ment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) is one of \nthe world’s largest social security\
    \ programs and has \nbeen the largest source of public funding, accounting \n\
    for almost 75 percent of all public finance allocations \nto forest protection\
    \ and landscape restoration during \n2011–2016 (Chaturvedi et al. 2018). It is\
    \ a demand-\ndriven wage employment program that provides at least \n100 days\
    \ of guaranteed wage employment in every\nfinancial year to every rural household\
    \ whose adult\nmembers volunteer to do unskilled manual work. The \npotential\
    \ for MGNREGS to build durable natural assets \nsuch as tree-based interventions\
    \ in private and common \nlands can be beneficial for improving the productivity\
    \ of \nland, soil health, and water, while also providing income \nand promoting\
    \ inclusive growth (Sharma and Dadwani \n2013). In Bastar, Chhattisgarh, an agro-silvi-horticul-\n\
    ture and soil conservation model was undertaken using \nMGNREGS for activities\
    \ such as bunding, building a \npercolation well, planting fruit trees, and planting\
    \ mul-\ntipurpose trees on bunds. A major outcome of this effort \nhas been the\
    \ conservation of 6.4 tonnes (t) of soil per \nha, whereas 8 t of soil per ha\
    \ was recorded in untreated \nlands (MoRD 2013). MGNREGS was factored into the\
    \ \nNational Agroforestry Policy 2014, and funds from the \nscheme have been dovetailed\
    \ with other schemes, such \nas the National Horticulture Mission, National Mis-\n\
    sion for a Green India, Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana, \nand National Rural Livelihoods\
    \ Mission to undertake \nagroforestry and trees outside of forest activities.\
    \ In the \nselected states, MGNREGS has been used to fund state \npolicies/schemes\
    \ such as the Krushi Aaranya Protsaha \nYojana in Karnataka, Telanganaku Haritha\
    \ Haram, \nMission Plantation in Maharashtra, Guru Nanak Jayanti \nplantation\
    \ activities in Punjab, social forestry in Gujarat, \nand horticulture interventions\
    \ in Odisha. Across India, \nNRM activities of MGNREGS can significantly increase\
    \ \nthe resilience of rural populations to the impacts of \nclimate change (Steinbach\
    \ et al. 2020). They can also \ncontribute significantly to climate change mitigation;\
    \ \na study assessing the carbon sequestration potential \nof MGNREGS activities\
    \ as a cobenefit estimates that \nin 2017–2018 works under the scheme sequestered\
    \ \napproximately 63 million tonne CO2e (Ravindranath \nand Murthy 2018).\n APPENDIX\
    \ B. GLOBAL EXPERIENCE WITH \nTOF INCENTIVES\nAcross the globe there are instances\
    \ of public incentives \nto support ToF, including direct subsidies, payments\
    \ for \necosystem services, credit and grants, reduced tax rates, \nand regulatory\
    \ incentives in the form of a reduced legal \nburden and tenure and resource rights.\
    \ For instance, \nFrance facilitated agroforestry scaling in 2010 through \na\
    \ policy that included agroforestry as a legal agricultural \nland use qualifying\
    \ for agricultural subsidies, thereby \nproviding investment support to farmers\
    \ willing to prac-\ntice agroforestry on farmlands (Place et al. 2012). To \n\
    protect and restore strategic water supply regions, the \ngovernment of Brazil\
    \ developed payments for ecosystem \nservices (PES) schemes that provide financial\
    \ incentives \nto individuals protecting and restoring their privately \nowned\
    \ lands (Urzedo et al. 2020). One such scheme—\nWORKING PAPER  |  March 2022 \
    \ |  27\nRoadmap for Scaling Trees outside Forests in India\nConservador das Águas—a\
    \ watershed PES program, \nestablished in 2005, promoted native forest conser-\n\
    vation in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest and required \nparticipating farmers to\
    \ make individually defined \ncommitments—mostly related to restoration of natural\
    \ \nvegetation in and around springs and riverbanks. The \npayments, given monthly\
    \ and spread over four years, \nwere based on the total area of farmers’ landholdings\
    \ \nand on a reference value defined by the municipal \nadministration (equivalent\
    \ to ~US$87/hectare/year) \nin 2009 (Cassola 2010). The Systemas Agroforestales\
    \ \n(SAF) PES program introduced in Costa Rica in 2004 \nwas effective in overcoming\
    \ initial economic and \ntechnical obstacles that made adoption of agroforestry\
    \ \nunattractive for smallholders. The participating farmers \nwere required to\
    \ grow a minimum of 350 trees, and a \nmaximum of 3,500 were allowed per contract.\
    \ Payments \n(a total of US$1.30 per tree) were given over the first \nthree years\
    \ (65 percent in the first year, 20 percent in \nthe second, and 15 percent in\
    \ the third year), on tree \nsurvivorship of 85 percent or more. Farmers reported\
    \ \npositive economic benefits in the first couple of years of \nthe program,\
    \ and it was found that participating farmers \nalso planted substantially more\
    \ trees and more species \nthereafter than nonparticipant farmers (Arriagada et\
    \ al. \n2012; Cole 2010).\nFigure C1 |   Share of States in Total Allocation of\

    \ dimensions. These systems, which are \nalso agricultural biodiversity repositories,\
    \ provide a \nunique opportunity to enhance food security, ensure \nlocal livelihoods,\
    \ and adapt to climate change. Examples \nof traditional ToF, particularly agroforestry,\
    \ practiced in \nthe six select states are given in Table H1 below.\n38  |  \n\
    APPENDIX I. ADDITIONAL DETAILS ON \nPOLICY INCENTIVES FOR TREES OUTSIDE \nOF FORESTS\
    \ IN INDIA \nKey subsidies in select states\nGujarat, Karnataka, Maharashtra,\
    \ Odisha,  Punjab, and \nTelangana are incentivizing farmers by providing free\
    \ or \nsubsidized saplings under various state schemes, such as \nthe Krushi Aranya\
    \ Protsaha Yojana (KAPY), Telanganaku \nHaritha Haram, Greening Punjab Mission,\
    \ Maharashtra \nMission Plantation, and Kanya Van Samriddhi Yojana, \namong others.\
    \ \nThe states are also providing subsidies for development of \ninfrastructure\
    \ to support ToF systems. For instance, the \nRainfed Area Development Programme\
    \ (RADP) under \nthe National Mission on Sustainable Agriculture has \nbeen implemented\
    \ in five of the selected states (barring \nPunjab) on almost 61,500 ha of land\
    \ during 2015–2019. \nWhile data on utilization for specific activities under\
    \ the \nRADP are not available, RADP provides financial sub-\nsidies for building\
    \ infrastructure, such as setting up of \ngreenhouses, composting, etc., to support\
    \ agroforestry. \nUnder Gujarat’s Rehabilitation of Degraded Farm Land \n(RDFL)\
    \ scheme, private farmlands, especially those with \nmedium to low productivity,\
    \ are selected for tree plan-\ntation in block or on the bunds. The Forest Department\
    \ \nundertakes the raising of plants, digging of pits, and \nplanting in the farm\
    \ at cost (Gujarat Forest Department \nn.d. [c]). In Telangana, the horticulture\
    \ scheme covers \ncharges for pitting, planting, and staking saplings (PCCF \n\
    [SF] Telangana 2020). In Odisha, the Directorate of Hor-\nticulture provides financial\
    \ assistance for construction \nof vermicompost units and subsidies for drip irrigation\
    \ \n(Directorate of Horticulture Odisha n.d.). In Punjab, the \nState Department\
    \ of Horticulture covers 50 percent of \nthe cost of rejuvenation/replacement\
    \ of senile plantation \nand canopy management, 50 percent subsidy for build-\n\
    ing water harvesting systems for horticulture, 25 to 50 \npercent subsidy for\
    \ building infrastructure and buying \nequipment (10 percent increase in subsidy\
    \ for SC, small \nand marginal farmers, and women) (Punjab Department \nof Horticulture\
    \ n.d.). In Maharashtra, the Social Forestry \nDepartment, through its agroforestry\
    \ scheme, provides \na 100 percent subsidy to small and marginal farmers for \n\
    support with land development for integrating trees in \ntheir fields (PCCF [SF]\
    \ Maharashtra 2020).\nSTATE\nTRADITIONAL AGROFORESTRY\nKarnataka\nTraditional\
    \ agroforestry systems, with trees grown alongside crops and/or livestock, abound\
    \ in the Western Ghats region \nof Karnataka. Plantation agriculture involving\
    \ coffee (Coffea spp.), and spices in association with a wide spectrum of trees,\
    \ \npaddy-based cropping systems, coconut (Cocos nucifera)-based cropping systems,\
    \ and homesteads are prevalent (Kumar and \nTakeuchi 2009). \nIn Malnad regions\
    \ of Karnataka that fall in the hot, humid ecoregions, betel nut and paddy is\
    \ a common combination. In the hot \nsemi-arid ecoregion of Karnataka, ficus trees\
    \ are grown alongside millets, maize, and oil seeds. \nOdisha\nIn Odisha, shifting\
    \ cultivation has been a traditional form of agroforestry, especially in the districts\
    \ inhabited by the Scheduled \nTribes. Growing multipurpose trees on farmlands\
    \ and home gardens with a mix of indigenous fodder, fuelwood, and horticulture\
    \ \ntree species is also prevalent in the state (Mohapatra et al. 2007). \nMaharashtra\n\
    In Amravati District of Maharashtra, falling in the hot semi-arid ecoregion, farmers\
    \ have been growing teak as a major spe-\ncies on farm bunds for decades. While\
    \ some farmers prefer only teak on the bunds, mixed tree species on the bunds\
    \ are also \nprevalent.  Other tree species grown on bunds with teak are Butea\
    \ monosperma, Wrightia tinctoria, Terminalia bellirica, Diospyros \nmelanoxylon\
    \ and Ailanthus excelsa (Bhoyar et al. 2016). In the coastal belt of the state,\
    \ manga bamboo (Dendrocalamus stocksii) \nhas been grown extensively by some villages\
    \ for centuries. The bamboo species is found as scattered clumps in homesteads,\
    \ \nas live hedges, and even as compact block plantations (Viswanath et al. 2018).\n\
    Gujarat\nOne of the major agroforestry practices in the state of Gujarat, characterized\
    \ by hot and arid climate, involves combining Proso-\npis cineraria with other\
    \ agricultural crops (Jaimini and Tikka 2007). \nPunjab\nIn Punjab, a hot and\
    \ semi-arid ecological region, farmers have been known to grow native trees—kikar\
    \ (Acacia nilotica) and \nkhair (Acacia catechu) as scattered trees on lands for\
    \ fodder and fuelwood. In farmlands, native species like neem (Azadirachta \n\
    indica) and shisham (Dalbergia sissoo) and toon (Tuna ciliata) have been commonly\
    \ grown on bunds of farmlands. \nTelangana\nIn Telangana, characterized by a hot\
    \ and semi-arid climate, shifting cultivation has been traditionally practiced\
    \ to grow millets, \noilseeds, and pulses, especially in regions dominated by\
    \ the tribal community. On average, 10–15 different types of species are \ngrown\
    \ together. In Adilabad region, farmers currently grow vegetables, oilseeds, and\
    \ pulses together. The practice of growing \nmillets has, however, decreased,\
    \ and cash crops like cotton have taken over (Kaushal et al. 2016).\nSource: Compiled\
    \ by WRI India authors\nWORKING PAPER  |  March 2022  |  39\nRoadmap for Scaling\
    \ Trees outside Forests in India\nThe National Bamboo Mission (NBM) provides sub-\n\
    sidies to farmers, farmer groups, self-help groups \n(SHGs), and the private sector\
    \ on a range of activities. \nThese include a 100 percent input subsidy for setting\
    \ \nup hi-tech, big and small nurseries; implementing and \nmaintaining high-density\
    \ bamboo plantations in gov-\nernment, panchayat, and community lands; and block\
    \ \nplantations in farmers’ fields (land development and \nplanting) (MoAFW n.d.\
    \ [b]; NMSA n.d.). The Bamboo \nMission is operational in five states (excluding\
    \ Punjab) \nwith varying levels of engagement. For instance, the \nnumber of bamboo\
    \ nurseries that have been built under \nNBM are as follows: Karnataka (17), Maharashtra\
    \ (2), \nand Gujarat (17). There is a paucity of delineated data on \nstate-level\
    \ activities, uptake of incentives, and utilization \nof funds under the Bamboo\
    \ Mission.\nKey grants \nThe grants available for ToF are provided by NABARD’s\
    \ \nTribal Development Fund (TDF), the Rashtriya Krishi \nVikas Yojana (RKVY)\
    \ for agroforestry, and the 15th \nFinance Commission. NABARD has been instrumental\
    \ \nin providing grants  for establishing the wadi model of \nagroforestry. NABARD’s\
    \ wadi model is a type of agrofor-\nestry system that focuses on planting a combination\
    \ of \nfruit and forest trees in lands owned by small and mar-\nginal tribal farmers\
    \ (<5 acres) with value-added layers \nsuch as formation of cooperatives, marketing,\
    \ and food \nprocessing. Barring Punjab, NABARD has sanctioned \ngrants for the\
    \ wadi scheme in each of the other five \nstates. The RKVY under its Crop Diversification\
    \ Pro-\ngramme offers a financial incentive of INR 10,000 per \nha for poplar-based\
    \ agroforestry systems (INR 5,000 \nfor critical inputs, INR 2,500 for land development,\
    \ \nand INR 2,500 for marketing support).  It also provides \ngrants for agroforestry.30\
    \ Recently, the 15th Finance \nCommission of India recommended catalytic assistance\
    \ \nto 12 of the most drought-prone states31 to develop long-\nterm drought mitigation\
    \ plans to address the challenges \nposed by successive droughts in the period\
    \ 2021–2026 \n(XV Finance Commission 2020). This assistance funds a \nrange of\
    \ activities that include agroforestry for mitigat-\ning droughts, inter alia.\
    \ \nCredit-linked loans \nGujarat is implementing a credit-linked loan under \n\
    the Adivasi Vruksh Kheti Scheme, which incentivizes \ntribal farmers to plant\
    \ high-value crops (80 percent teak \nand 20 percent bamboo, mango, etc.) in 0.2\
    \ ha to a max-\nimum of 1.0 ha area. Assistance of INR 2.50 per plant is \nprovided\
    \ after 9 months for up to 18 years. There is also \nprovision for 20 percent\
    \ casualty replacement according \nto survival of plants in year two. The assistance\
    \ amount \nwill be recovered when the plantation is harvested \n(Gujarat Forest\
    \ Department n.d. [b]).\nInsurance\nKarnataka provides insurance against loss\
    \ of income \nfrom crop damage for annual horticulture crops such as \npomegranate,\
    \ papaya, mango, and commercial species \nsuch as arecanut under the Karnataka\
    \ Raitha Suraksha \nPradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (KRS-PMFBY) \nand Weather\
    \ Based Crop Insurance Scheme (WBCIS). \nMaharashtra’s restructured WBCIS includes\
    \ horticul-\nture trees such as orange, sweet lime, pomegranate, and \nguava.\
    \ Under this scheme farmers pay only 5 percent \nof the total insurance premium,\
    \ while the remainder is \npaid by the central and state governments. \nThe Coconut\
    \ Palm Insurance Scheme minimizes the risk \nto farmers by providing insurance\
    \ against pests, dis-\neases, and natural calamities in the coconut-producing\
    \ \nstates of India. Among the six states, this insurance is \navailable in Gujarat,\
    \ Karnataka, Maharashtra, and Odi-\nsha (CDB n.d.). The Coconut Development Board\
    \ (CDB) \ncovers 50 percent of premium cost, the respective state \ngovernments\
    \ cover 25 percent, and the farmer pays the \nremaining 25 percent premium. \n\
    Supply chain infrastructure \nThe Mission for Integrated Horticulture Development\
    \ \nprovides financial assistance to states covering 35 to 50 \npercent cost for\
    \ horticulture produce.  Activities include \non-farm collection and storage units,\
    \ integrated pack \nhouses for sorting and grading, precooling units, cold \n\
    storage units, ripening chambers, postharvest storage and \ntreatment facilities\
    \ for bamboo, and cold storage units \nfor commercial horticulture (RKVY n.d.).\
    \ These facilities \ncan be used by ToF farmers, farmer producer companies \n\
    (FPCs), self-help groups (SHGs), and other user groups \ninvolved in sale or value-addition\
    \ of horticulture produce. \nNBM provides subsidies to farmers, farmer groups,\
    \ \nSHGs, and the private sector for bamboo treatment and \npreservation, processing\
    \ and value-addition, machineries \nand equipment for common value-addition facilities,\
    \ and \nfor skill development (MoAFW n.d. [b]). \nThe National Bamboo Mission\
    \ also assists in setting up \nvarious product development units, including handi-\n\
    crafts, furniture, bamboo shoots–processing, incense \nsticks, etc.; 278 such\
    \ units have been set up in the coun-\ntry. The Ministry of Micro, Small, and\
    \ Medium Enter-\nprises (MSME) is implementing the Scheme of Fund \nfor Regeneration\
    \ of Traditional Industries (SFURTI) to \norganize traditional industries and\
    \ artisans into clus-\nters to increase their capacity and income. Thirty-six\
    \ \n40  |  \nbamboo-related clusters have been set up in 13 states \n(Parliament,\
    \ Lok Sabha 2021b).\nAPPENDIX J. WADI FOR TRIBAL \nDEVELOPMENT AND ECOSYSTEM \n\
    SERVICES\nNABARD has expanded the implementation of the wadi \nmodel across India\
    \ with 772 wadi projects being pro-\nmoted with grants of INR 20.9 billion to\
    \ benefit 529,215 \ntribal families in different parts of the country through\
    \ \nvarious NGOs or implementing partners.\n“Wadi,” meaning “fruit orchard” in\
    \ Gujarati, is a type \nof agroforestry system that focuses on planting a \ncombination\
    \ of fruit and forest trees in underproduc-\ntive agricultural lands with value-added\
    \ layers, such \nas the formation of cooperative, marketing, and food \nprocessing.\
    \ The BAIF Development Research Founda-\ntion, a not-for-profit organization,\
    \ conceptualized the \nmodel and piloted it for the tribal families of Vansda,\
    \ \nGujarat (Ajwani and Sawant n.d.). With community \nparticipation and scientific\
    \ techniques at the heart of the \nproject, wadi envisions sustainable livelihoods,\
    \ institu-\ntion-building, environmental sustainability, and com-\nmunity well-being.\
    \ A key feature of the wadi concept is \nthe empowerment of people through social\
    \ mobilization \nand capacity-building to address issues beyond farming \n(BAIF\
    \ n.d.). In 2005, NABARD introduced the Tribal \nDevelopment Fund (TDF) to implement\
    \ wadi across \nIndia by partnering with civil society organizations that \nact\
    \ as Project Implementing Agencies (PIAs). \nAPPENDIX K. BLACK BAZA COFFEE FOR\
    \ \nSUSTAINABLE AND BIODIVERSITY-\nFRIENDLY COFFEE\nBlack Baza Coffee is a sustainable\
    \ coffee company based \nin Karnataka with a vision to enable coffee producers\
    \ \nto enjoy secure and stable livelihoods and strengthen \ncoffee farming practices\
    \ that conserve biodiversity \n(Black Baza Coffee n.d.). The company works with\
    \ small \nand large coffee producers, farmer producer companies, \nand other user\
    \ groups that are willing to adopt biodi-\nversity-friendly coffee-growing practices.\
    \ Integrating \nnative trees in coffee plantations significantly improves \nsoil\
    \ moisture content; provides shade, especially during \nsevere heat and drought\
    \ seasons, to the coffee plants; \nand provides a habitat for birds and bees that\
    \ help with \npollination and can also act as natural pest-control \nmeasures\
    \ (Bose 2020). Given that many coffee growers \nare small or marginal farmers,\
    \ Black Baza Coffee has \nentered into conservation agreements with individual\
    \ \nfarmers and groups through which they are trained on \nsustainable coffee\
    \ practices. The type of restoration \nintervention and tree species to be planted\
    \ are selected \nthrough a participatory process with the farmers and \nlocal\
    \ communities. Black Baza Coffee has connected \nwith 396 smallholder farmers\
    \ and, through their long-\nterm pricing strategy, increased procurement price\
    \ by \n56 percent (Black Baza Coffee n.d.). Farmers involved \nwith Black Baza\
    \ Coffee are conscious of the ecological \nimportance of native trees and are\
    \ actively developing \nmetrics to monitor biodiversity and other environmental\
    \ \nindicators in the long term (Bose 2020). \nDry Fence\nFruit Trees\nTrench-cum-bund\n\

    Agriculture (https://nmsa.dac.gov.in/Default.aspx). Allocation refers to \nthe\
    \ funds allocated from the central pool of resources with a funding \npattern\
    \ of 60:40 between the center and state; release of funds refers \nto the actual\
    \ amount transferred from the center to states, which \ndepends on criteria such\
    \ as submission of action plans and utilization \ncertificates from the previous\
    \ financial year; fund utilization refers to \nthe amount used by the state to\
    \ fund scheme-related activities.\n10. The search words used were a combination\
    \ of “agroforestry,” “trees \noutside forests,” “success stories,” “research and\
    \ promotion of \nagroforestry and trees outside forest,” “incentive for implementation\
    \ of \nagroforestry schemes,” “tree planting schemes incentives,” “exemplary \n\
    projects on agroforestry, tree planting.” These search words were \naccompanied\
    \ with the names of the respective “states” to glean out \nstate-specific incentive\
    \ mechanisms.\n11. Vermicomposting is a managed process wherein worms digest organic\
    \ \nmatter to transform the material into a beneficial soil amendment. \n12. The\
    \ pattern of assistance in such cases is 50 percent subsidy from \ngovernment,\
    \ 40 percent bank loan, and 10 percent payable by the \nbamboo farmer/entrepreneurs\
    \ (NBM n.d.). \n13. The National Biodiversity Authority (NBA), the State Biodiversity\
    \ Boards \n(SBBs), and the Biodiversity Management Committees (BMCs) are \ninvolved\
    \ in the approval of applications from non-Indian and Indian \ncompanies/researchers.\
    \ The funds received through benefit-sharing \nmust be channeled back to the benefit\
    \ claimers (farmers, communities \ngrowing the bioresource) and used to protect\
    \ and restore biodiversity \nin the respective forest and nonforest areas as indicated\
    \ in the appli-\ncation and for socioeconomic development in the area (GoI 2002).\n\
    14. The National Agroforestry Policy highlights the importance of expand-\ning\
    \ insurance and providing tree insurance for tree crops in agroforest-\nry systems\
    \ to stabilize income from ToF systems and protect farmers \nfrom natural hazards.\
    \ There are three insurance companies—United \nIndia Insurance, Agriculture Insurance\
    \ Company of India, and Oriental \nInsurance Company—that provide tree insurance\
    \ covering pulpwood \ntrees, such as Casurina spp. (casuarina), Eucalyptus spp.\
    \ (eucalyptus), \nMelia dubia (hebbevu), and Hevea brasiliensis (rubber), along\
    \ with \ntrees like Ailanthus excelsa (ardu), Gmelina arborea (gamhar), Leucaena\
    \ \nleucocephala (subabul), and Dalbergia sissoo (shisham). Other species \ninclude\
    \ biofuel plants/trees like Millettia pinnata (karanja), Azadirachta \nindica\
    \ (neem), Madhuca longifolia (mahua), Calophyllum inophyllum \n(champa), and Simarouba\
    \ glauca (Lakshmi Taru) as well as horticultur-\nal crops like Areca catechu (arecanut\
    \ palm), Theobroma cacao (cocoa), \nand Hevea brasiliensis (rubber) (Uthappa et\
    \ al. 2015). \n15. Felling trees is banned in India through regulatory frameworks\
    \ like the \nIndian Forest Act of 1927 and the Forest Conservation Act of 1980.\
    \ This \nwas instituted with a view to conserve forest resources.  Harvest and\
    \ \ntransit of farm-grown timber is controlled rigorously and requires prior \n\
    permission. Consequently, Indian states have stringent timber felling \nand transit\
    \ regulations that pose a hindrance to farmers willing to \npractice agroforestry\
    \ as a livelihood (TetraTech 2017; GoI 2014). \n16. In 2019, to commemorate the\
    \ 550th birth anniversary of the Sikh guru, \nGuru Nanak Dev, the state launched\
    \ a program to plant 550 saplings of \nnative species in panchayat lands of each\
    \ village in the state. \n17. The Panchayati Raj System of local governance in\
    \ India has three \nlevels: gram panchayat (village level), janpad panchayat (block\
    \ level), \nand zilla panchayat (district level). It was formalized in 1992 by\
    \ the \n73rd Amendment to the Indian Constitution. A gram panchayat is the \n\
    executive committee of a gram sabha, which comprises all the adults \nof a village.\n\
    18. For the project, the implementing partners, Central Research Institute \n\
    for Dryland Agriculture, CPF, and WWF-India, built the technical capac-\nity of\
    \ farmers for planting tree-crop combinations and other farming \ntechniques (CPF\
    \ 2020).\nENDNOTES\n1. WRI India conducted a systematic literature review of tree-based\
    \ \nlandscape restoration to analyze its potential to contribute to climate \n\
    change mitigation and adaptation simultaneously. The results are \nbeing synthesized\
    \ in a working paper that is under review.  \n2. The Bonn Challenge is a global\
    \ goal to bring 150 million hectares of \ndegraded and deforested landscapes into\
    \ restoration by 2020, and \n350 million hectares by 2030. \n3. The Land Degradation\
    \ Neutrality (LDN) target program supports \ncountries to achieve quantifiable\
    \ targets for improving quality of land \nresources. To date, over 120 countries\
    \ have committed to setting LDN \ntargets\n4. The atlas excludes areas where tree-based\
    \ interventions are not \necologically or socially appropriate, such as areas\
    \ covered by perma-\nnent ice and snow, sand dunes, natural scrublands, swamp\
    \ forests, \ngrasslands, wetlands, and water bodies. National parks, sanctuaries,\
    \ \nstate reserves and wildlife reserves, and forests with over 70 percent \n\
    tree cover were also removed to ensure healthy and/or fragile eco-\nsystems are\
    \ not affected by tree-based interventions. Since the atlas \nprovides data at\
    \ the national level, areas under surface and ground-\nwater irrigation are excluded\
    \ since the nuances in trade-offs between \nfood security and restoration cannot\
    \ be adequately addressed at this \nscale. In rainfed areas, croplands with tree\
    \ cover density of more than \n40 percent were also removed since these areas\
    \ already support high \ntree cover, and further increases may result in trade-offs\
    \ with food \nsecurity and other provisioning services. Finally, urban and built-\n\
    up areas and areas with population density of over 400 people per \nsquare kilometer\
    \ were excluded to mitigate concerns over multiple \ndemands on lands.\n5. A landscape\
    \ approach to ToF can lead to multiple environmental and \ndevelopment benefits.\
    \ Landscapes encompass a mosaic of land uses \nincluding forests, farmlands, pasturelands,\
    \ built-up areas, etc. The \nlandscape approach provides a “framework to integrate\
    \ policies and \npractices for multiple land uses to ensure equitable and sustainable\
    \ \nuse of land while strengthening measures to mitigate and adapt to \nclimate\
    \ change” (Reed et al. 2015). A landscape approach to ToF will \nrecognize the\
    \ interactions between diverse stakeholders and multiple \nland uses and focus\
    \ on addressing environmental and socioeconomic \nproblems jointly (GLF 2014).\
    \ It will help identify areas that need to be \nprotected, maintained, and restored\
    \ for multiple ecosystem services, \nsuch as biodiversity, soil, water, carbon,\
    \ and provisioning of fuelwood, \nfodder, and nontimber forest produce.\n6. ”Wadi,”\
    \ meaning “fruit orchard” in Gujarati, is a type of agroforestry \nsystem that\
    \ focuses on planting a combination of fruit and forest \ntrees in underproductive\
    \ agricultural lands with value-added layers \nsuch as formation of cooperative,\
    \ marketing, and food processing.\n7. The Sub-Mission on Agroforestry is being\
    \ implemented in 20 states—\nAndhra Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Haryana,\
    \ Himachal \nPradesh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra,\
    \ \nOdisha, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh, \nMizoram,\
    \ Meghalaya, and Nagaland, and two UTs—Jammu and Kash-\nmir and Ladakh. The funding\
    \ pattern is 60:40 between national and \nstate governments for all states except\
    \ the North East and Hill States, \nwhere it is 90:10, and 100 percent in the\
    \ case of UTs & national-level \nagencies (Parliament, Lok Sabha 2021a).\n8. Mission\
    \ refers to initiatives from the government that have clearly \ndefined objectives,\
    \ scopes, implementation time lines and milestones, \nand measurable outcomes\
    \ and service levels.\n9. Data on allocation, release, and utilization (progress/achievement)\
    \ are \ncollated in the online portal of the National Mission for Sustainable\
    \ \n42  |  \n19. Leveraging the Odisha Livelihood Mission that brought together\
    \ sev-\neral women SHGs, and converged resources from MGNREGS and the \nBamboo\
    \ Mission for implementing agroforestry (Rizvi et al. 2020).\n20. The management\
    \ practices detailed in the app include details on \ncommon name, botanical name,\
    \ family, potential area, silvicultural \nrequirements, nursery techniques, planting\
    \ techniques, tending oper-\nations, suitable agroforestry systems, tree protection,\
    \ yield, utilization, \nand material availability.\n21. The Karnataka State Bamboo\
    \ Mission (SBM) partnered with Industree \nFoundation with support from the United\
    \ States Agency for Interna-\ntional Development (USAID) to establish a bamboo\
    \ research center in \nChannapatna to shine a light on the 900-year-old bamboo-based\
    \ crafts \ncreated by Medhar Tribe artisans. Focusing on women, the project \n\
    aims to involve over 6,000 women in collectives and make connections \nwith large\
    \ retailers, such as FabIndia, for the sale of products. The SBM \nwill support\
    \ the sourcing of bamboo from local bamboo plantations \noutside forest areas\
    \ and plan to set up certification and chain-of-cus-\ntody standards to ensure\
    \ higher prices for products (Industree \nFoundation n.d.)\n22. In Odisha, for\
    \ instance, the company ITC Limited promotes farm \nforestry by providing smallholders\
    \ with subsidized saplings at INR 1; \nwith the remainder of the sapling costs\
    \ deposited by the farmer in \na group fund, from which loans can be made available\
    \ (Suresh et al. \n2014). In Punjab, private sector companies are credited with\
    \ providing \nhigh-quality planting material to farmers (Chavan et al. 2015).\
    \ In Guja-\nrat, paper mills and other industries have promoted block plantation\
    \ by \nproviding planting material and extensive support services (Dixit 2020).\
    \ \nPaper mills, particularly in Gujarat, Karnataka, Odisha, and Punjab have \n\
    provided a number of input subsidies to farmers, particularly through \nsupply\
    \ of saplings of fast-growing varieties of eucalyptus, acacia, and \nCasuarina.\n\
    23. The monitoring system envisages daily delivery of progress reports \nfrom\
    \ the districts to the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (PCCF). \nPlanting\
    \ carried out by the Forest Department and Rural Development \nDepartment are\
    \ geotagged to monitor survival rates.\n24. Quality planting material would help\
    \ to improve adaptability to adverse \nenvironmental conditions, meet raw material\
    \ requirements of markets, \nand ensure a good survival rate. The quality of planting\
    \ material is \ndetermined by origin, the authenticity of variety and stock, vegetation\
    \ \ndevelopment, and state of health (NCCF n.d.)\n25. Scheduled Caste: Castes,\
    \ races, or tribes or parts of such social \ngroups who form a category defined\
    \ as “backward classes” or socially \ndeprived people for whom the Constitution\
    \ of India, Article 341, has \nmade separate provisions for upliftment and protection.\
    \ Scheduled \nTribe: Tribes or tribal communities deemed as “Scheduled Tribes”\
    \ under \nArticle 342 of India’s Constitution. The constitution makes special\
    \ \nprovisions for the protection of these communities, and the state is \nexpected\
    \ to execute schemes for their welfare and upliftment.\n26. For instance, in 2014\
    \ the Andhra Pradesh state government worked \nout a tripartite agreement with\
    \ agroforestry farmers and industries for \nprocurement of Eucalyptus and Casuarina\
    \ at INR 4,400 per tonne and \nINR 4,200 per tonne, respectively. However, paper\
    \ mills bypassed the \nAgriculture Market Committees and, using agents, procured\
    \ from farms \nfor prices as low as INR 2,500 and INR 2,000, leading to frustration\
    \ \namong farmers (The Hindu 2020). Market fluctuations in the past have \ndecreased\
    \ farmers’ interest. For instance, between 2001 and 2005, \nprices of poplar crashed,\
    \ severely affecting farmers, especially in \nPunjab (TERI 2020). This cycle occurred\
    \ again in 2015 largely driven by \nthe overall global market recession and imbalance\
    \ in the demand-sup-\nply dynamic in favor of buyers in the local market (TERI\
    \ 2020). Farmers \nface devastation when they are unable to recover from such\
    \ crashes.\n27. The MSP for MFP scheme came into effect in 2011 to provide a social\
    \ \nsafety net to underprivileged forest dwellers and tribal MFP gatherers, \n\
    and to aid in their empowerment. MSPs are now applicable for about \n50 MFPs,\
    \ and the scheme has connections with Van Dhan Yojana and \nVan Dhan tribal start-ups\
    \ to improve livelihoods of the tribal population. \nIn light of the COVID-19\
    \ pandemic and the impact on livelihoods of \nforest dwellers, the MSPs were revised\
    \ with increases ranging from 16 \nto 66 percent (in some cases such as for giloe/\
    \ Tinospora cordifolia, \nthe increase has been up to 190 percent) (MoTA 2020a).\
    \ States can \nfix MSP up to 10 percent higher or lower than the MSP declared\
    \ by \nthe GoI. Further, the MSP for MFP scheme promotes value-addition, \nbranding,\
    \ and marketing of MFPs by establishing Van Dhan Kendras \n(VDKs) to facilitate\
    \ creation of sustainable livelihoods for forest-based \ntribes. Similar incentives\
    \ that encourage formation of user groups for \nvalue-addition can support ToF\
    \ farmers to earn better incomes.\n28. This scheme covers pulpwood trees such\
    \ as Casuarina, Eucalyptus \n(pulpwood), Melia dubia (plywood), Ailanthus, Gmelina\
    \ (matchwood), \nLeucaena, and Dalbergia sissoo. The premium for plantation ranges\
    \ \nbetween INR 300 and INR 600 annually, depending on the input cost of \nthe\
    \ respective tree species, and covers against forest and bush fires, \nlightning,\
    \ riot and strike, storm and cyclone, flood and inundation, and \nloss due to\
    \ wild animal attack (Parthiban 2016).\n29. These include government-led schemes\
    \ and programs such as Startup \nIndia and Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojna (RKVY)—Remunerative\
    \ Ap-\nproaches for Agriculture and Allied Sector Rejuvenation (RKVY-RAFTA-\n\
    AR).  There are also programs run by NGOs and research institutions \nthat are\
    \ building capacity and providing financial to restoration \nentrepreneurs, including\
    \ WRI’s Land Accelerator (The Land Accelerator \nn.d.), TNAU’s Mettupalayam Agroforestry\
    \ Business Incubation Forum \n(TNAU-MAFBIF n.d.), and ICRISAT’s Agri-Business\
    \ incubator (ICRISAT \nn.d.), among many others.\n30. The Rashtriya Krishi Vikas\
    \ Yojana (RKVY) has three subschemes—\nBringing Green Revolution to Eastern India\
    \ (BGREI), Additional Fodder \nDevelopment Programme (AFDP), and Crop Diversion\
    \ Programme \n(CDP)—which provide grants as financial incentives. These grants\
    \ \ncover certain agroforestry interventions. The BGREI includes financial \n\
    incentive of INR 2,000 per ha for cost of saplings for undertaking tree \nplanting\
    \ on farm bunds in the North Eastern Region. The CDP is being \nimplemented in\
    \ Haryana, Punjab, and western Uttar Pradesh, and aims \nto demonstrate and promote\
    \ improved production technologies of \nalternate crops for diversification of\
    \ paddy cultivation and to restore \nsoil fertility. Under CDP, there is a financial\
    \ incentive for INR 10,000 per \nha for poplar-based agroforestry systems (INR\
    \ 5,000 for critical inputs, \nINR 2,500 for land development, and INR 2,500 for\
    \ marketing support).\n31. The 15th FC has allocated INR 1 billion each (total\
    \ INR 12 billion) to the \n12 most drought-prone states over five years (2021–2026):\

    ABOUT THE AUTHORS  \nMarie Duraisami is a former manager with the Sustainable\
    \ Landscapes \nand Restoration program at WRI India.\nRuchika Singh is the director\
    \ of the Sustainable Landscapes and \nRestoration program at WRI India.\nSwati\
    \ Chaliha is a former consultant with the Sustainable Landscapes \nand Restoration\
    \ program at WRI India.\nABOUT WRI INDIA\nWRI India is a research organization\
    \ that turns big ideas into action at the \nnexus of environment, economic opportunity,\
    \ and human well-being.\nOur Challenge\nNatural resources are at the foundation\
    \ of economic opportunity and \nhuman well-being. But today, we are depleting\
    \ Earth’s resources at rates \nthat are not sustainable, endangering economies\
    \ and people’s lives. \nPeople depend on clean water, fertile land, healthy forests,\
    \ and a stable \nclimate. Livable cities and clean energy are essential for a\
    \ sustainable \nplanet. We must address these urgent, global challenges this decade.\n\
    Our Vision\nWe envision an equitable and prosperous planet driven by the wise\
    \ \nmanagement of natural resources. We aspire to create a world where the \n\
    actions of government, business, and communities combine to eliminate \npoverty\
    \ and sustain the natural environment for all people.\nOur Approach\nCOUNT IT\n\
    We start with data. We conduct independent research and draw on the \nlatest technology\
    \ to develop new insights and recommendations. Our \nrigorous analysis identifies\
    \ risks, unveils opportunities, and informs smart \nstrategies. We focus our efforts\
    \ on influential and emerging economies \nwhere the future of sustainability will\
    \ be determined.\nCHANGE IT\nWe use our research to influence government policies,\
    \ business \nstrategies, and civil society action. We test projects with communities,\
    \ \ncompanies, and government agencies to build a strong evidence \nbase. Then,\
    \ we work with partners to deliver change on the ground \nthat alleviates poverty\
    \ and strengthens society. We hold ourselves \naccountable to ensure that our\
    \ outcomes will be bold and enduring.\nSCALE IT\nWe don’t think small. Once tested,\
    \ we work with partners to adopt and \nexpand our efforts regionally and globally.\
    \ We engage with decision-\nmakers to carry out our ideas and elevate our impact.\
    \ We measure \nsuccess through government and business actions that improve people’s\
    \ \nlives and sustain a healthy environment.\nCopyright 2022 World Resources Institute.\

    mathematical and economic tools are used to assess the potential benefits of water
    transfers between the agricultural and municipal sectors in El Paso County, Texas.
    The scenarios are based on water consumption and revenue data over the last 20
    years. The study demonstrates that pima cotton has historically consumed the greatest
    quantities of water while generating the least revenue to farmers (average gross
    revenues over 20 years equals US$300/acre-foot of water); peppers and onions have
    gross revenues of US$980/acre-foot and US$1,260/acre-foot, respectively. The study
    also indicates that equal amounts of water generate higher revenues in the municipal
    sector versus the agricultural sector. In 1999, 90,000 million gallons of water
    would have generated US$175,000,000 in the municipal sector in comparison to US$90,000,000
    in the agricultural sector. Finally, an “El Paso Water Transfer Center” is proposed
    to create a water market in El Paso County and dictate water prices based on supply/demand
    interactions. The water transfer center will also insure that farmers receive
    monetary incentives for the water they conserve and transfer to the municipal
    sector. An acre-foot (AF) is the volume of water that would cover one acre to
    a depth of one foot, which is 43,560 cubic feet or 1233.5 cubic meters. This measurement
    unit is used in this paper since the literature, agreements and negotiations rely
    on acre-foot measurements in this region. Keeping the units in acre-feet will
    facilitate negotiations and applications of this study to regional users. Keywords:

    \ online: 15 October 2022 \n© The Author(s) 2022\nAbstract\nIn theory, building\
    \ automation and management systems (BAMSs) can provide all the \ncomponents and\
    \ functionalities required for analyzing and operating buildings. However, \n\
    in reality, these systems can only ensure the control of heating ventilation and\
    \ air condi-\ntioning system systems. Therefore, many other tasks are left to\
    \ the operator, e.g. evaluating \nbuildings’ performance, detecting abnormal energy\
    \ consumption, identifying the changes \nneeded to improve efficiency, ensuring\
    \ the security and privacy of end-users, etc. To that \nend, there has been a\
    \ movement for developing artificial intelligence (AI) big data analytic \ntools\
    \ as they offer various new and tailor-made solutions that are incredibly appropriate\
    \ \nfor practical buildings’ management. Typically, they can help the operator\
    \ in (i) analyzing \nthe tons of connected equipment data; and; (ii) making intelligent,\
    \ efficient, and on-time \ndecisions to improve the buildings’ performance. This\
    \ paper presents a comprehensive sys-\ntematic survey on using AI-big data analytics\
    \ in BAMSs. It covers various AI-based tasks, \ne.g. load forecasting, water management,\
    \ indoor environmental quality monitoring, occu-\npancy detection, etc. The first\
    \ part of this paper adopts a well-designed taxonomy to over-\nview existing frameworks.\
    \ A comprehensive review is conducted about different aspects, \nincluding the\
    \ learning process, building environment, computing platforms, and applica-\n\
    tion scenario. Moving on, a critical discussion is performed to identify current\
    \ challenges. \nThe second part aims at providing the reader with insights into\
    \ the real-world application \nof AI-big data analytics. Thus, three case studies\
    \ that demonstrate the use of AI-big data \nanalytics in BAMSs are presented,\
    \ focusing on energy anomaly detection in residential and \noffice buildings and\
    \ energy and performance optimization in sports facilities. Lastly, future \n\
    directions and valuable recommendations are identified to improve the performance\
    \ and \nreliability of BAMSs in intelligent buildings.\nKeywords Artificial intelligence ·\

    \ embedding\n1 Introduction\n1.1  Preliminary\nBuilding automation and management\
    \ systems (BAMSs) are intelligent systems of both \nhardware and software, connecting\
    \ heating ventilation and air conditioning system (HVAC) \nsystems, lighting,\
    \ security, and other systems to communicate on a single platform. That \nsaid,\
    \ BAMSs deliver crucial information to operators and/or users on the operational\
    \ per-\nformance of buildings, which aim at promoting energy efficiency and optimizing\
    \ water \nconsumption, enhancing the safety and comfort of the occupants, reducing\
    \ maintenance \ncosts, extending the life cycle of the utilities, etc (Ippolito\
    \ et al. 2014). This is possible \nby networking a plethora of sensors and components\
    \ responsible for the monitoring and \noperation of mechanical, security, fire,\
    \ lighting, HVAC and humidity control and ventila-\ntion systems (Su and Wang\
    \ 2020).\nWith the broad utilization of information and communication technologies\
    \ (ICTs), sens-\ning and measurement technologies along with the cloud computing,\
    \ big data storage and \ndata analytics, conventional BAMSs are being revolutionized.\
    \ Vast quantities of building \n4933\nAI‑big data analytics for building automation\
    \ and management…\n1 3\nautomation and management data are produced, gathered\
    \ and saved (Sardianos et al. 2020; \nHimeur et al.). This has offered an excellent\
    \ opportunity for implementing big data min-\ning and analysis in BAMSs. In this\
    \ context, as the quantity of data collected in BAMSs is \nenormous, the ”big\
    \ data” phenomena is surfacing this field and revolutionizing the way \nwe manage\
    \ data by using AI-big data analytics tools (Quinn et al. 2020, Himeur et al.).\
    \ \nAccordingly, with advanced sensing and metering technologies in BAMSs, data\
    \ split into \nmultiple modalities and many variables can create a comprehensive\
    \ source of informa-\ntion to analyze. This allows for more targeted analysis,\
    \ but also means that more powerful, \nintelligent, and sophisticated tools are\
    \ needed to identify the most enormous patterns/varia-\nbles (Muntean et al. 2021).\
    \ As a consequence, the big data analytics market in the building \nenergy sector\
    \ is expected to grow at a Compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.28%, \nduring\
    \ the forecast period, 2021–2026.1 Data collection in the building industry is\
    \ becom-\ning all-embracing. This wealth of big data allows informed data-driven\
    \ decision-making by \ndesigners, facilities managers, and owners during building\
    \ design, operation, and retrofit \n(Berger et al.). On the other hand, for existing\
    \ or outdated buildings to make full use of \nthe services offered by the flourishing\
    \ data analytics market, the necessary enhancement \nto the existing system for\
    \ deploying the new technology must be addressed and sorted out \n(Varlamis et al.\
    \ 2022). The main challenges of gathering and analyzing data of old build-\nings\
    \ are the outdated technologies and the conventional error-prone data collection\
    \ means \n(Jia et al. 2019; Al Dakheel et al. 2020). Nevertheless, data analytics\
    \ can assist in designing \nand implementing the new system adaptation and existing\
    \ system renovation (Elnour et al. \n2022).\nBesides, it is of utmost importance\
    \ to know the current state of AI-based building \nautomation before presenting\
    \ the actual study concerning user input, demand, response, \nenergy-saving, and\
    \ automation. In this respect, it is obvious that AI adds new dimensions \nto\
    \ building automation environments by enabling autonomous data analysis for operation\
    \ \noptimization. Therefore, many AI-based contributions have recently emerged\
    \ as key solu-\ntions for (i) predicting building occupancy, (ii) forecasting\
    \ thermal comfort, (iii) boosting \nenergy saving, and (iv) enabling demand-side\
    \ response (Himeur et al. 2020). Additionally, \nas mentioned in previous studies,\
    \ (O’Grady et al. 2021) people can spend up to 90 percent \nof their lives in\
    \ buildings; this highlights the importance of user input, behavioral data, \n\
    and behavioral analytics for optimizing and automating building operations. To\
    \ that end, \na significant research effort is ongoing to develop AI-based behavioral\
    \ change technolo-\ngies to promote energy saving in residential and office buildings\
    \ (Sayed et al., Varlamis \net al. 2022), understand consumers demand patterns\
    \ for successful demand response devel-\nopment (Cruz et al. 2021; Pratt and Erickson\
    \ 2020), optimizing occupants’ thermal com-\nfort (Zheng et al. 2022), transforming\
    \ water management (Doorn 2021), improving fault \ndetection and diagnosis (Yun\
    \ et al. 2021), etc. Moreover, AI-based big data analytics are \ncontributing\
    \ to building automation by making BAMSs self-learning, self-configuring and \n\
    self-diagnosing, and self-commissioning (Katipamula 2019). Additionally, using\
    \ AI-based \nanalytics can adapt existing building systems to promote the deployment\
    \ of BAMSs with \nfewer investments from building owners.\nFrom another hand,\
    \ as AI models are very competent to learn common human error \npatterns, their\
    \ use in big data analytics is significant. They can (i) detect and resolve pos-\n\
    sible flaws in datasets, (ii) learn by watching how the operators and users interact\
    \ with \n1 https:// www. resea rchan dmark ets. com/ repor ts/ 47749 56/ big-\

    \ from large-\nscale datasets fast (Mahmud et al. 2020; Diamantoulakis et al.\
    \ 2015). In this context, AI \nmodels assist operators and users of BAMSs to perform\
    \ the different tasks related to the \nbig data cycle, among them the operations\
    \ of collecting, pre-processing, aggregating, stor-\ning, analyzing and extracting\
    \ various kinds of features (Hu and Vasilakos 2016; Bode et al. \n2019). Moving\
    \ on, the integration of AI-big data analytics can (i) optimize energy and \n\
    operational efficiency, (ii) automate monitoring and control through wireless\
    \ platforms, \n(iii) provide quick and better decision making, (iv) smartly control\
    \ the facility and reduce \nrisk failures, (v) lower life cycle costs, and (vi)\
    \ increase safety and security measures with \nease (Aghemo et al. 2014; Zhou\
    \ and Yang 2016; Aste et al. 2017).\n1.2  Paper contributions\nDue to the importance\
    \ of using AI-big data analytics in BAMSs, a plethora of works have \nbeen proposed\
    \ to (i) address different challenges, (ii) improve and automate building oper-\n\
    ation, and (iii) optimize building user experience. In addition, different reviews\
    \ have been \nintroduced to discuss the advances made in this research topic,\
    \ such as (Zhang et al. 2021; \nMolina-Solana et al. 2017; Zhao et al. 2020).\
    \ However, most of them have only focused \non addressing one task at a time,\
    \ e.g., energy management, rather than covering multiple \nBAMS tasks together\
    \ (e.g., water management, occupancy detection, comfort optimiza-\ntion, fault\
    \ diagnosis and anomaly detection (FDAD), etc.) (Sun et al. 2020; Wang et al.\
    \ \n2021; Fan et al. 2018). To that end, we present in this paper a comprehensive\
    \ systematic \nsurvey reflecting the latest developments in the field of AI-big\
    \ data analytics and their uti-\nlization in BAMSs from different perspectives.\
    \ For example, Zhang et al. (2021) discuss \nsensor impact verification and evaluation\
    \ for FDAD in energy systems, while Molina et al. \n(2017) review the contributions\
    \ of data science for building energy management issues. \nMoving on, data mining\
    \ strategies used for building energy management are overviewed \nin Zhao et al.\
    \ (2020). Similarly, in Sun et al. (2020), data-driven techniques for energy \n\
    prediction in buildings are described. Besides, Wang et al. (2021) focus on studying\
    \ the \npractical problems related to implementing ML models for building energy\
    \ efficiency. It \nalso investigates the commitment of existing studies to comfort\
    \ and energy saving (i.e., \nSave energy with/without compromising thermal comfort).\
    \ Moreover, in Fan et al. (2018), \nunsupervised data mining methodologies for\
    \ energy efficiency improvement are analyzed. \nLastly, in Pinto et al. (2022),\
    \ Pinto et al. discuss the roles of transfer learning integration \nfor smart\
    \ buildings and systems.\nTo that end, we present in this paper a comprehensive\
    \ survey reflecting the latest devel-\nopments in the field of AI-big data analytics\
    \ and their utilization in BAMSs from different \nperspectives. Thus, we first\
    \ introduce a generic taxonomy for classifying AI-big data ana-\nlytics frameworks\
    \ based on various criteria, including the learning method, building envi-\nronment,\
    \ computing platform, and application or challenge addressed. Typically, an over-\n\
    view of existing works and discussions is presented, highlighting some of the\
    \ challenges, \nlimitations, and shortcomings. Then, three case studies are presented\
    \ illustrating the use of \nAI-big data analytics for critical concerns in the\
    \ buildings sector, that is, energy efficiency \nand management, to provide the\
    \ reader with insight into real-world applications. The opti-\nmization of energy\
    \ consumption in buildings has been a hot research topic recently2 in \n2 https://\
    \ www. energy. gov/ sites/ prod/ files/ 2017/ 03/ f34/ qtr- 2015- chapt er5. pdf.\n\
    4935\nAI‑big data analytics for building automation and management…\n1 3\nterms\
    \ of efficient planning, proper management, and preventive maintenance. Lastly,\
    \ future \ndirections to ease the use of AI-big data analytics models in BAMSs\
    \ and improve their \nfeedback are derived. To summarize, the contributions of\
    \ the presented work are manifold:\n– Providing a thorough review covering the\
    \ general use of AI-big big data analytics in \nBAMSs and shedding light on their\
    \ increasing importance for developing efficient and \nsmart BAMSs.\n– Presenting\
    \ a well-designed taxonomy of existing AI-big data analytics frameworks, \nwhich\
    \ helps in understanding intriguing relationships between various concepts and\
    \ \nvariables in the field. Different criteria have been adopted when analyzing\
    \ existing \nframeworks, including the learning method, building environment,\
    \ computing platform, \napplication, etc.\n– Conducting a critical analysis and\
    \ discussion to (i) extract diverse relevant lessons that \nare learned from overviewed\
    \ works; and (ii) highlight open issues and current chal-\nlenges, among them\
    \ data scarcity, data benchmarking, security and privacy, scalability \nand interoperability\
    \ and real-time big data intelligence.\n– Presenting three case studies that describe\
    \ the use of AI-big data analytics in BAMSs \nfor buildings energy management\
    \ and optimization, such that the first two case studies \ndemonstrate unsupervised\
    \ and supervised energy anomaly detection strategies in resi-\ndential and office\
    \ buildings, and the third one is about energy and performance optimi-\nzation\
    \ in sports facilities.\n– Deriving a set of future research and development directions\
    \ that attract considerable \ninterest in the near and far future, and help in\
    \ improving the performance and reliability \nof BAMSs.\nTable 1 outlines some\
    \ of the main differences between the actual review and other survey \nstudies.\
    \ It also sheds light on some of the main contributions addressed by this review\
    \ \ncompared to the others in terms of overviewed resources (i.e., ML tools and\
    \ computing \nplatforms), application scenarios, discussed challenges (i.e., security\
    \ issues), evaluation \nmetrics, case studies, and proposed future directions\
    \ (i.e., multimodal data analysis, in-situ \nsensor calibration in BAMSs, smart\
    \ building digital twins, blockchain edge analytics, etc.).\n1.3  Review methodology\n\
    A well-established review methodology is adopted in this paper, where we first\
    \ con-\nduct a comprehensive literature search in the most popular scientific\
    \ databases, includ-\ning Scopus, Elsevier, Wiley, and IEEE. Following, most of\
    \ the works that deal with the \nuse of AI-big data analytics for BAMSs are included\
    \ in this study. Many keywords and \ntheir combination are then used in the search,\
    \ e.g., ”building automation and manage-\nment systems”, ”big data analytics”,\
    \ ”artificial intelligence”, ”machine learning”, ”deep \nlearning”, ”transfer\

    \ evaluates and critically analyses overviewed frameworks to identify the open\
    \ issues \nand current challenges. Section 5 presents three case studies that\
    \ describe the use of AI-big \ndata analytics in BAMSs for energy anomaly detection\
    \ in residential and office buildings, \nand energy optimization in sports facilities.\
    \ Moving on, Sect. 6 presents the future direc-\ntions for improving the performance\
    \ of BAMSs. Finally, conclusions and significant find-\nings are summarized in\
    \ Sect. 7.\n2  Evolution of BAMSs\nIn the last decades, BAMSs have been rapidly\
    \ developed; indeed, from the 1950s to 1990s, \nthey have been transformed from\
    \ pneumatics to electronics then open protocols (e.g. BAC-\nnets). Moving forward,\
    \ with the digitization era, BAMSs have further progressed by (i) \nintegrating\
    \ more powerful and smart technologies, (ii) becoming easier to implement in \n\
    different kinds of buildings, and (iii) using high-quality softwares to aid the\
    \ users in getting \nthe most pertinent information from their buildings. Indeed,\
    \ digitization has significantly \nFig. 1  The significant progress made in the\
    \ development of BAMSs during the last two decades\n 4938\nY. Himeur et al.\n\
    1 3\naccelerated with the launch of smartphones, where these devices have abruptly\
    \ replaced \nmobile communicators, cell phones, etc. and become more practical\
    \ in many real-world \napplications as they deliver different benefits, such as\
    \ supporting apps.\n2.1  Progress made during the two last decades\nWe briefly\
    \ described in this section the most significant achievements made in the devel-\n\
    opment of BAMSs during the last two decades, which can be summarized as portrayed\
    \ \nin Fig. 1. Typically, in 2008, it became possible to virtualize BAMSs in data\
    \ centers, \nand hence receives greater security and availability and enables\
    \ more flexible access to \nbuildings’ data. In 2009, WiFi was integrated to BAMSs\
    \ to help in flexibly and remotely \nmonitoring appliances in households and commercial\
    \ centers (Wang 2009). Following, \nin 2010, due to the growing utilization of\
    \ smartphones and tablet computers in smart \ncity applications to control smart\
    \ and location-based products, BAMSs have been also \npositively influenced through\
    \ developing more sophisticated and portable BAMSs solu-\ntions (Aste et al. 2017).\n\
    By 2014, audio files had been deployed in BAMSs using the text-to-speech (TTS)\
    \ \ntechnology. The latter enabled to support preventive inspections and maintenance,\
    \ work \ncontracts, service requests, work contracts, equipment audits, etc (Mundt\
    \ et al. 2014). In \n2016, IoT began to significantly influence the society after\
    \ that IoT devices found their \nway into the building management sector, where\
    \ six billion devices were installed and \nmore than 31 billion were expected\
    \ in 2020 (Aste et al. 2017). Explicitly, the impor-\ntance of automation has\
    \ been increased in both existing and new buildings. Follow-\ning, in 2018, commercial\
    \ buildings have progressively evolved into smart buildings \nand routines have\
    \ been improved and/or automated in BAMSs, resulting in enhanced \ncomfort and\
    \ efficiency (Markoska and Lazarova-Molnar 2018; Lee and Karava 2020). \nLastly,\
    \ in 2020, AI joined the spectrum of BAMSs to help in early fire detection, and\
    \ \nenergy demand prediction. Moreover, it becomes possible to identify behavioral\
    \ change \nthrough the analysis of real-time data. Thus, BAMSs learn from experiences\
    \ and histori-\ncal data for automatically adjusting the indoor conditions (Yaïci\
    \ et al. 2021).\n2.2  Big data sources\nThis section discusses and describes the\
    \ essential sources of heterogeneous big data \nused to implement AI-big data\
    \ analytics in BAMSs. Indeed, developing and accelerat-\ning the advance and deployment\
    \ of BAMSs require the installation of a large number \nof smart sensors, smart\
    \ meters, and other measurement devices in the different parts \nof each building,\
    \ which helps in (i) increasing the observability of its transient and \ndynamic\
    \ events, and (ii) gather actual data related to the diverse functionalities of\
    \ the \nbuilding. This will later help the AI-big data analytics in accurately\
    \ analyzing this data \nand extracting pertinent features and therefore facilitating\
    \ the operation and monitoring \nof all building technology, especially in larger\
    \ buildings. Figure 2 portrays the overall \narchitecture of a BAMS and its principal\
    \ data sources. The control module is the central \nbrain of the BAMS, and most\
    \ of the controllers are built using the industry standard \nBACnet protocols\
    \ in addition to Konnex (KNX); an open communication standard for \ncommercial\
    \ and domestic building automation, LonWorks; a standardized bus system \nused\
    \ in centralized and decentralized building automation control (Merz et al. 2018),\
    \ \n4939\nAI‑big data analytics for building automation and management…\n1 3\n\
    and Modbus; a network communication protocol for connecting electronic equipment\
    \ in \nindustrial automation systems. Overall, a BAMS can provide various services\
    \ to control \n(i) heating and cooling, (ii) lighting, (iii) security, (iv) access\
    \ control, (v) fire and life \nsafety, and (vi) elevators and escalators.\n3 \
    \ Overview of AI‑big data analytic frameworks\n3.1  Overall taxonomy\nTo understand\
    \ the challenges related to AI-big data analytics in BAMSs, it is essen-\ntial\
    \ to perform a generic taxonomy of existing AI-big data analytics techniques used\
    \ \nfor monitoring the smart buildings. Specifically, Fig. 3 provides a structured\
    \ analysis \nframework that helps in overviewing existing techniques and shedding\
    \ the light on the \norganization of the presented framework.\n3.2  AI‑learning\
    \ process\nThe first step in any AI process is system learning. This can take\
    \ four primary forms: \nsupervised learning, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised,\
    \ and reinforcement learn-\ning. In this section, we present an overview of existing\
    \ AI learning architectures used to \nimprove the performance of BAMSs.\nFig.\
    \ 2  Principal services of a BAMS system\n 4940\nY. Himeur et al.\n1 3\n3.2.1\
    \  Unsupervised learning (U)\nUnsupervised learning learns from raw data without\
    \ prior knowledge and mainly deals \nwith unlabeled datasets. Although it does\
    \ not need to annotate data as supervised learn-\ning, the learning phase can\
    \ be more computational as all the possibilities are checked. \nThe accuracy is\
    \ lower since there are no corresponding outputs (labels) (Himeur et al. \n2021).\n\
    3.2.1.1 U1. Clustering It is a category of ML algorithms used for separating data\
    \ (e.g. \nenergy consumption observations, ambient conditions, etc.) into different\
    \ classes or clus-\nters following a specific goal. Clustering algorithms usually\
    \ pertain to one of the follow-\ning groups, i.e. hybrid, fuzzy-based, model-based,\
    \ and density-based approaches. Using the \nclustering process facilitates the\
    \ classification tasks when dealing with various problems, \nsuch as anomaly detection\
    \ of energy consumption, indoor environmental quality (IEQ) \nmonitoring and detection\
    \ of pollutants, detection of abnormal water consumption, etc.\nK-means, C-means\
    \ and fuzzy C-means (FCM) were among the most investigated clus-\ntering approaches.\
    \ They have been applied for non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) and \nappliance\
    \ identification (Ji et  al. 2019; Zhang et  al. 2020), energy performance evalua-\n\
    tion and ranking in working spaces (Sun and Yu 2021), energy efficiency assessment\
    \ in \nFig. 3  Taxonomy of existing AI-big data analytics frameworks\n4941\nAI‑big\
    \ data analytics for building automation and management…\n1 3\nindustrial buildings\
    \ (Liu et al. 2018), building management and identification of operat-\ning anomalies\
    \ (when analyzing electricity, gas and water consumption) (Akil et al. 2019),\
    \ \nIEQ monitoring (Dogruparmak et al. 2014; Cao et al. 2020; Alghamdi et al.\
    \ 2020; Roger \nRozario 2021), energy forecasting (Tian et al. 2020; Chen et al.\
    \ 2020; El Motaki et al. \n2021), and data sampling for better visualization (Qin\
    \ and Zhang 2017).\nIn Culaba et al. (2020), an energy prediction model is introduced\
    \ using a k-means model \nto cluster data, and a support vector machine (SVM)\
    \ is employed to forecast energy con-\nsumption. In Himeur et al. (2021), three\
    \ clustering algorithms, namely one-class support \nvector machine (OCSVM), density-based\
    \ spatial clustering of applications with noise \n(DBSCAN), and local outlier\
    \ factor (LOF), are used to detect anomalous energy consump-\ntion in households\
    \ by analyzing energy footprints. Besides, in Afaifia et al. (2021), hierar-\n\
    chical cluster analysis (HCA) is implemented to model residential energy consumption\
    \ and \npromote energy efficiency. Clustering-based techniques have been used\
    \ in BAMSs because \nof their simplicity and relatively computational efficiency.\
    \ Also, clustering models gener-\nally have few parameters to tune. However, they\
    \ have different limitations that affect their \napplications in BAMSs, among\
    \ them the manual selection of the optimal K, dependency \non initial values,\
    \ troubles to cluster data with varying densities and sizes, the need for scal-\n\
    ing as the number of dimensions increases, etc. (Li et al. 2018).\n3.2.1.2 U2.\
    \ Dimensionality reduction In diverse ML tasks, dimensionality reduction tech-\n\
    niques can be employed to classify data while promoting low computational costs\
    \ as they \nfirst remove irrelevant observations. Accordingly, a plethora of frameworks\
    \ have been pro-\nposed in the literature to explore the applicability of dimensionality\
    \ reduction schemes in \nBAMSs. That includes the principal component analysis\
    \ (PCA), factor analysis, linear dis-\ncriminant analysis (LDA), quadratic discriminant\
    \ analysis (QDA), and multiple discrimi-\nnant analysis (MDA), isometric feature\
    \ mapping (Isomap) (Liu et al. 2020), kernel principal \ncomponent analysis (KPCA)\
    \ (Abba et al. 2020), t-distributed stochastic neighbor embed-\nding (t-SNE) (Zhan\
    \ et al. 2020; Lopes et al. 2020), multidimensional scaling (MDS) (Wang \n2020,\
    \ and truncated singular value decomposition (TSVD) (Kalantzis et al. 2021).\n\
    For instance, PCA has been utilized for early fault detection and classification\
    \ (Li and \nWen 2014; Cotrufo and Zmeureanu 2016; Chen and Wen 2017; Swiercz and\
    \ Mroczkowska \n2019), IEQ (Mansor et al. 2021), energy consumption prediction\
    \ (Sha et al. 2019), occu-\npancy detection in buildings (Pal et al. 2019), etc.\
    \ Moving on, LDA has been employed \nfor thermal comfort evaluation (Gładyszewska-Fiedoruk\
    \ and Sulewska 2020), sensor-based \noccupancy detection (Fayed et  al. 2019).\
    \ Using dimensionality reduction in BAMS has \ngained attention because it can:\
    \ (i) reduce the storage space and time needed to classify \nrecorded data, (ii)\
    \ improve the interpretation of the ML models’ parameters by removing \nmulticollinearity,\
    \ and (iii) simplify data visualization (Al-Kababji et al. 2022). However, \n\
    dimensionality reduction models have some disadvantages. For example, (i) this\
    \ can result \nin relevant data loss, (ii) finding linear correlations between\
    \ variables (as PCA does) can be \nno appropriate in some scenarios, and (iii)\
    \ some dimensionality reduction models can fail \nin classifying variables if\
    \ the covariance and mean are not sufficient to represent datasets \n(Himeur et al.\
    \ 2021; Abdulhammed et al. 2019).\n 4942\nY. Himeur et al.\n1 3\n3.2.2  Supervised\
    \ learning (S)\nSupervised learning is applied for the case of labeled energy\
    \ datasets. Despite its high per-\nformance, the necessity of labeled data causes\
    \ some difficulties in real-world applications.\n3.2.2.1 S1. Classification It\
    \ refers to conventional ML models that attempt to derive some \nconclusions from\
    \ the input data given in the training process, and hence aim at predicting \n\
    the class labels/categories for a new set of data. Classification models have\
    \ widely been \ndeployed in existing BAMS based big data analytics frameworks\
    \ to perform different tasks, \ne.g. energy forecasting, energy balancing, IAQ\
    \ monitoring, energy optimization, fault and \nanomaly detection. Typically, SVM,\
    \ K-nearest neighbors (KNN) (Valgaev et al. 2017), deci-\nsion tree (DT) (Yu et al.\
    \ 2010), artificial neural network (ANN) (Moon et al. 2019), multi-\nlayer perceptron\
    \ (MLP) (Haidar et al. 2019), extreme learning machine (ELM) (Salerno and \nRabbeni\
    \ 2018) and logistic regression (LR) (Rehman et al. 2020) are among the famous\
    \ \nclassification models deployed in BAMSs. Classification models have been used\
    \ in BAMSs \nsince they are simple to understand, fast and efficient. In addition,\
    \ they can excel in clas-\nsifying different kinds of BAMS data if accurately\
    \ labeled datasets are used in the train-\ning process. However, they have a set\
    \ of limitations. For instance, SVM models are not \nadequate for non-linear problems,\
    \ and their performance does not improve if the number of \nfeatures increases\
    \ while the number of neighbors ”K” is manually selected in KNN. Moreo-\nver,\
    \ poor results are usually obtained with DT algorithms on small datasets, and\
    \ overfitting \ncan quickly occur (Himeur et al. 2021).\n3.2.2.2 S2. Regression\
    \ It is based on the identification of the relation between two or more \nenergy\
    \ consumption observations for producing a set of model parameters, that help\
    \ in pre-\ndicting and classifying them for different purposes, including energy\
    \ prediction, anomaly \ndetection, security and privacy preservation, etc. Diverse\
    \ regression models have been pro-\nposed to analyze BAMSs’ data, e.g. support\
    \ vector regression (SVR) (Zhong et al. 2019), \nlinear regression (LR), auto-regressive\
    \ (AR) models, regression tree (RT) and regression fit-\nting (RFT). Regression\
    \ models have gained popularity in smart buildings and smart energy \nsystems\
    \ because most of them are easy to implement and interpret, and efficient to train.\
    \ \nAlso, they perform remarkably well for linearly separable data. However, it\
    \ is worthy to note \nthat regression models involve complicated and lengthy procedures\
    \ of analysis and calcula-\ntions in addition to assuming the existence of linearity\
    \ between the dependent and independ-\nent variables, which is not always the\
    \ case in real-world applications (Bilous et al. 2018).\n3.2.2.3 S3. Deep neural\
    \ networks (DNN) It is a subclass of ML that is principally a NN \nincluding more\
    \ than two layers. These DNNs aim at simulating the behavior of the human \nbrain\
    \ ”albeit far from matching its ability”, which allows them to learn from large-scale\
    \ \ndatasets. In addition to the capability of NNs with a single layer for making\
    \ approximate \npredictions, DNNs have further benefits via (i) optimizing and\
    \ refining the classification \naccuracy when additional hidden layers are considered,\
    \ and (ii) identifying the most inform-\native features of the data.\nDNNs have\
    \ become the state-of-the-art methods in various ML-based domains, simi-\nlarly\
    \ in BAMSs, they are attracting greater attention. They have widely used for energy\
    \ \nforecasting, this is the case of recurrent neural networks (RNN), long short-term\
    \ memory \n(LSTM) (Gao et al. 2019; Wang et al. 2020), gated recurrent unit (GRU)\
    \ (Lin et al. 2021), \nbidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) (Haq et  al. 2021; Ishaq and\
    \ Kwon 2021), convolutional \n4943\nAI‑big data analytics for building automation\
    \ and management…\n1 3\nLSTM (ConvLSTM) (Syed et al. 2021), multiplicative LSTM\
    \ (mLSTM) (Krause et al.), \nbidirectional GRU (BiGRU) (Khan et  al. 2020), coupled\
    \ input and forget gate (CIFG) \n(Runge and Zmeureanu), deep feed forward neural\
    \ networks (DFNN) (Marino et al. 2016), \nand convolutional neural network (CNN)\
    \ (Li et  al. 2017). Moreover, numerous hybrid \nmodels have been built by combining\
    \ the aforementioned models with other deep learning \n(DL) architectures, such\
    \ as CNN-LSTM (Alhussein et al. 2020), CNN-BiLSTM (Wu et al. \n2021), partial\
    \ least square (PLS) CNN-BiLSTM (PLS-CNN-BiLSTM) (Wu et al. 2021), \nCNN-GRU (Sajjad\
    \ et al. 2020; Wu et al. 2020), conditional random fields (CRF) and RNN \n(CRF-RNN)\
    \ (Wytock and Kolter 2013), DFNN-LSTM (Bashari and Rahimi-Kian 2020), \nradial\
    \ basis function neural network-CNN (RBFNN-CNN) (Sideratos et al. 2020), etc.\n\
    DL models have also been used for other tasks, including smart IEQ monitoring,\
    \ where \ndifferent architectures were investigated, such as LSTM (Liu et al.\
    \ 2020; Janarthanan et al. \n2021), GRU (Ahn et al. 2017; Das et al. 2020), BiLSTM\
    \ (Ma et al. 2019), CNN (Moli-\nnara et al. 2020), residual neural network (ResNet)\
    \ (Zhang et al. 2020), variational autoen-\ncoders (VAE) coupled with CNN (VAE-CNN)\
    \ (Loy-Benitez et al. 2020a), memory-gated \nRNN-based autoencoders (MG-RNN-AE)\
    \ (Loy-Benitez et al. 2020b), sparse autoencoders \n(SAE) (Loy-Benitez et al.\
    \ 2020)\nOccupancy detection in buildings has also received the attention of the\
    \ DL commu-\nnity through the use of CNN (Zou et al. 2017), RNN (Zhao et al. 2018),\
    \ LSTM (Mutis \net  al. 2020), BiLSTM (Feng et  al. 2020). Moreover, as some studies\
    \ have investigated \nthe use of camera imagery (e.g. thermal cameras) to estimate\
    \ the number of occupants \ninside buildings, it was rational to use various CNN\
    \ backbones, which are widely utilized \nin image classification or image recognition,\
    \ among them ResNet (Acquaah et al. 2020), \nVGGNet (Zou et al. 2017), AlexNet\
    \ (Acquaah et al. 2020) and GoogLeNet (Tien et al. \n2020). Using DL models in\
    \ BAMSs has become a research hot-spot nowadays because of \ntheir robustness\
    \ to natural variations in the data, which is automatically learned. Addition-\n\
    ally, their performance significantly improves with increasing the quantity of\
    \ training data. \nHowever, DL models still face different challenges. Typically,\
    \ DL algorithms require large-\nscale training datasets to perform better than\
    \ other ML models. Moreover, their training is \ncomputationally expensive as\
    \ they are built on complex models. Additionally, DL models \nrequire expensive\
    \ GPUs and cloud data centers to run, which increases their deployment \ncost\
    \ (Guo et al. 2018; Himeur et al. 2020).\n3.2.2.4 S4. Statistical models They\
    \ refer to mathematical models embodying an ensem-\nble of statistical rules used\
    \ to generate data samples, predict the relationships between one \nor diverse\
    \ random/non-random variables or classify them. widely used statistical models\
    \ \ninclude Bayesian networks (BN) (Singh and Yassine 2018), naive Bayes (NB)\
    \ (Li et al. \n2020), generalized additive models (GAM) (Khamma et al. 2020),\
    \ bayesian belief networks \n(BBN) (Bassamzadeh and Ghanem 2017), restricted Boltzmann\
    \ machines (Elsaeidy et al. \n2019), conditional restricted Boltzmann machines\
    \ (CRBM) (Kang et al. 2020) and factored \nconditional restricted Boltzmann machines\
    \ (FCRBM) (Hafeez et  al. 2020). In BAMSs, \nthey have been used for different\
    \ tasks, such as selecting the most energy-efficient primary \nHVAC systems (Tian\
    \ et al. 2019), building energy and water retrofitting (Bertone et al. \n2018),\
    \ energy forecasting (Huang et al. 2018), assessing energy efficiency (Grillone\
    \ et al. \n2019), NILM (Verma et al. 2019), gas usage prediction (Pathak et al.\
    \ 2018), IEQ monitor-\ning (Giovanis 2019), etc. While most statistical models\
    \ are useful for BAMSs as they have \ndeterministic and stochastic components\
    \ to mathematically describe the functional relation-\nship between inputs and\
    \ outputs, they also have pitfalls. In this respect, if recorded data is \n 4944\n\
    Y. Himeur et al.\n1 3\nbiased or faulty, statistical modeling will be misleading.\
    \ In addition, these kinds of models \nare hard to apply to heterogeneous data\
    \ (Agha and Palmskog 2018).\n3.2.3  Semi‑supervised learning (SSL)\nSSL refers\
    \ to the process of training ML models using a small portion of labeled data along\
    \ \nwith a large number of unlabeled observations. Then, the ML models should\
    \ be able to \nlearn and make predictions on new data. It falls between unsupervised\
    \ learning and super-\nvised learning, which is also considered as a special instance\
    \ of weak supervision (Van \nEngelen and Hoos 2020). Although supervised learning\
    \ techniques are largely utilized in \nfor providing different BMAS services,\
    \ they can only reach high performance only when \nthey are trained with sufficient\
    \ labeled data. Otherwise, their performance could drastically \ndecrease if annotated\
    \ data is insufficient or not accurately labeled. Moreover, annotating \ndata\
    \ is a challenging, costly, and time-consuming task. In this regard, SSL has been\
    \ pro-\nposed as an alternative solution to address some of these issues.\nIn\
    \ BAMS, SSL has been widely used for fault and anomaly detection. For instance,\
    \ in \nFan et al. (2021, 2021), the authors introduce an SSL-based fault detection\
    \ and diagnosis \nin air handling units (AHUs) based on a semi-supervised neural\
    \ network (SSNN), which \nadopts a self-training strategy. Moving on, in Elnour\
    \ et al. (2021), Elnour et al. propose an \nSSL-based data-driven attack detection\
    \ scheme in HVAC systems to promote security in \nintelligent buildings. This\
    \ approach has been developed using an isolation forest and two \nML models, i.e.\
    \ PCA and 1D-CNN (IF-PCA-CNN). While in Li et al. (2021), an SSL-\nbased approach\
    \ to detect and diagnose chiller faults is presented using a semi generative \n\
    adversarial network (semi-GAN) model. In the same way, an SSL-based fault identifica-\n\
    tion scheme for building HVAC systems is proposed in Li et al. (2021) using a\
    \ modified \nGAN. In Nguyen et al. (2021), an SSL-based load monitoring solution\
    \ is introduced, which \nhas the ability to (i) augment the data, (ii) transform\
    \ existing labeled sets, and (iii) train a \nWiderResNet (the backbone model)\
    \ on the augmented data. Although SSL is an excellent \noption for developing\
    \ AI-big data analytics when labeled data is expensive to obtain, it has \nsome\
    \ limitations, e.g., the results are not stable, and the performance is lower\
    \ than that of \nsupervised learning. Typically, the decision boundary might be\
    \ overstrained if the training \ndataset does not have the annotated samples required\
    \ in each class (Lu 2009).\n3.2.4  Reinforcement learning (RL)\nReinforcement\
    \ learning is a field in artificial intelligence that involves an agent that devel-\n\
    ops the knowledge of the best strategy to follow to accomplish a defined objective\
    \ by trial \nand error given the interaction with its environment. Besides the\
    \ RL agent and the envi-\nronment, the main elements of an RL system are: (i)\
    \ the policy, which is a function that \ndefines the action taken by the RL agent\
    \ in a given time step (i.e., state), (ii) the reward, \nwhich defines the result\
    \ of the action taken by the agent due to its interaction with the \nenvironment,\
    \ and intuitively describes the desired behavior of the agent, and (iii) the value,\
    \ \nwhich indicates the long-term desirability of a set of states/actions given\
    \ the agent’s expe-\nrience and the likely future rewards (Collins and Cockburn\
    \ 2020). The agent explores the \npossible actions to be taken as the learning\
    \ progresses. Based on the consequence of the \nactions taken, it opts for actions\
    \ that maximize the cumulative reward. Reinforcement \nlearning algorithms can\
    \ be categorized as: (i) traditional RL (TRL) methods in which \n4945\nAI‑big\
    \ data analytics for building automation and management…\n1 3\ntabular (i.e. lookup\
    \ tables) or conventional value function approximation approaches (e.g., \ncoarse\
    \ coding, ML algorithms) are used; and (ii) deep RL (DRL), which represents the\
    \ \nevolution of the traditional methods where DL models (e.g., deep NNs, CNNs,\
    \ RNNs) are \nused to approximate the state and/or action value (Wang and Hong\
    \ 2020).\n3.2.4.1 R1. TRL models It is only efficient to use TRL for simple RL\
    \ problems where the \naction-state space can be represented in a tabular form\
    \ or approximated by a simple func-\ntion approximation algorithm. Monte Carlo\
    \ (MC), Q-leaning (QL), State-action-reward-\nstate-action (SARSA), policy gradient\
    \ (PG), and actor-critic (AC) are examples of TRL \napproaches. For TRL-based\
    \ BAMS applications, tabular QL was used for occupancy pre-\ndiction and HVAC\
    \ control to optimize the occupant comfort and energy consumption in \nBarrett\
    \ and Linder (2015), and controlling the HVAC system and windows for mechanical\
    \ \nand natural ventilation in Chen et al. (2018).\n3.2.4.2 R2. DRL models Recently,\
    \ RL has taken advantage of the DL technology to reach \nphenomenal results. Typically,\
    \ DL has been combined with RL due to its ability to capture \nall the intricate\
    \ details of the knowledge and also perform complicated learning tasks that \n\
    RL failed in doing so. This has given rise to DRL. In BAMSs and many other research\
    \ \nfields, DRL is becoming a significant focus of scientists. The commonly used\
    \ DRL methods \nare deep Q-learning (DQL), asynchronous advantage actor-critic\
    \ (A3C), deep deterministic \npolicy gradient (DDPG), and proximal policy optimization\
    \ (PPO). A review of DRL appli-\ncations for intelligent buildings energy management\
    \ was presented in Yu et al. DQL was \nused for indoor and domestic hot water\
    \ temperature control in Lissa et al. (2021) to optimize \nthe home energy management\
    \ system. In Wang et al. (2017), a DRL-based control system \nfor office HVAC\
    \ systems using an RNN-based actor-critic approach was presented. In Val-\nladares\
    \ et al. (2019), double Q-learning was utilized for energy optimization and thermal\
    \ \ncomfort control, while PPO method was applied in Azuatalam et al. (2020);\
    \ Chemingui \net al. (2020) for controlling the building’s HVAC systems for energy\
    \ and thermal comfort \noptimization.\nAL in all, RL models (TRL and DRL) are\
    \ utilized for solving very complex problems \nthat can not be fixed using traditional\
    \ ML or DL models. They can also correct the errors \noccurring during the training\
    \ stage. However, exceeding the number of required RL stages \ncan result in an\
    \ overload of states, and hence reducing the performance of RL models \n(Ding\
    \ et al. 2019).\n3.2.5  Ensemble methods (E)\nEnsemble methods are a class of\
    \ ML that deploy different aggregation strategies for com-\nbining multiple learning\
    \ models and then achieving better predictive performance com-\npared to the use\
    \ of a unique learning algorithm.\n3.2.5.1 E1. Boosting It implies the gradual\
    \ development of an ensemble learning using \na set of ML models, where every\
    \ new model occurrence is trained for emphasizing the \ntraining occurrences that\
    \ previous models misclassified. In some applications, boosting can \nachieve\
    \ better performance than bagging; however, it often looks after overfitting the\
    \ train-\ning data. Random forest (RF), adaptive Boosting (Adaboost), and eXtreme\
    \ gradient boost-\ning (XGBoost) were among the most used boosting models for\
    \ different AI-big data analyt-\n 4946\nY. Himeur et al.\n1 3\nics tasks, such\
    \ as overall building energy consumption forecasting (Zekić-Sušac et al. 2021;\
    \ \nXiao et al. 2021; Ferdoush et al.; Wang and Chen 2021; Yucong and Bo 2020),\
    \ heating and \nventilation load prediction (Sun et al. 2020), HVAC optimization\
    \ (Li 2020), Space cooling \nload forecasting (Feng et al. 2021), load disaggregation\
    \ and monitoring (Xiao et al. 2021), \nwater monitoring (Somontina et al. 2018;\
    \ Movahedi and Derrible; Golabi et al. 2020), IEQ \nmonitoring (Mo et al. 2019).\n\
    Following, other variants have been then introduced and utilized for performing\
    \ energy \nforecasting and load monitoring, IEQ monitoring, water management and\
    \ occupancy \ndetection in different kinds of buildings, including gradient boosting\
    \ machine (GBM) \n(Gong et al. 2020), extreme gradient boosting machine (XGBM)\
    \ (Gong et al. 2020), gradi-\nent boosting regression tree (GBRT) (Nie et al.\
    \ 2021), LightGBM (Park et al. 2021; Wang \net al. 2020).\n3.2.5.2 E2. Bootstrap\
    \ aggregating It is also abbreviated as bagging and refers to the design \nof\
    \ a new ML model by aggregating multiple models that have equal weights in the\
    \ ensem-\nble vote. Every model is trained using a randomly drawn subclass of\
    \ training data for pro-\nmoting the model’s variance. Various bagging models\
    \ have been developed, modified and \nused to perform different tasks in BAMSs.\
    \ For instance, bagging ARIMA (BARIMA) in de \nOliveira and Oliveira (2018) is\
    \ proposed to conduct a mid-long term load forecasting, while \nin Khwaja et al.\
    \ (2015), a bagging neural network (BNN) is developed where the bagging \nconcept\
    \ is combined with neural networks (NNs) to improve short-term energy prediction.\
    \ \nMoving on, in Hu et al. (2020), an enhanced bagged echo state network (BESN)\
    \ is intro-\nduced to forecast energy. In Choi and Hur (2020), a bagging model\
    \ is developed by setting \nRF, XGBoost and LightGBMs as the base learners. In\
    \ Dehalwar et al. (2016), the authors \nintroduce a bagged regression tree (BRT)\
    \ that has been used for energy forecasting.\nMoreover, bagging models have also\
    \ been employed for water management in buildings \nusing ensemble bagging tree\
    \ (EBT) (Hasanzadeh Nafari et al. 2016), and thermal evalu-\nation using bagged\
    \ tree (BT) (Ahmad and Chen 2018), and fault detection using bagged \nauto-associative\
    \ kernel regression (BAAKR) (Yu et al. 2017).\nOverall, ensemble methods have\
    \ been used in BAMSs since they can result in better \npredictive accuracy than\
    \ individual models in complex systems/models Moreover, they are \nappropriate\
    \ for scenarios with linear and non-linear data variables. However, ensembling\
    \ is \nless interpretable, and the outputs of ensemble models are complex to explain\
    \ and predict \nin most applications. In addition, a wrong selection of the models\
    \ to be aggregated will \narise lower predictive accuracy than individual models.\
    \ Furthermore, ensemble models are \ngenerally computationally expensive and require\
    \ much storage memory.\n3.3  Building environments and their characteristics\n\
    Buildings range in size, function, construction, design, and other attributes.\
    \ Additionally, \nthey present varying levels of potential hazards and risks to\
    \ the occupants and the sur-\nrounding environment. However, buildings are primarily\
    \ classified based on the utilization \npurpose that governs occupancy profile,\
    \ sophistication level, and building design require-\nments. Building environments\
    \ are further described in the following subsections.\n4947\nAI‑big data analytics\
    \ for building automation and management…\n1 3\n3.3.1  Residential buildings\n\
    Residential buildings are mainly for private occupancy, designed and built for\
    \ individu-\nals or groups, providing the necessary facilities and utilities to\
    \ satisfy living requirements. \nSpaces in residential buildings involve several\
    \ activities, including sleeping, sitting, con-\nveniences, cooking, dining, and\
    \ others. Those functions can be in shared spaces or have \nexclusive rooms per\
    \ function. They exist in various sizes and have different occupancy \nrates.\
    \ A low occupancy density generally characterizes them. Examples of residential\
    \ \nbuildings are story houses, apartments, terraces, and condominiums. In addition\
    \ to air con-\nditioning and ventilation systems, lighting, and media equipment,\
    \ several major appliances \nare regularly used in residential buildings, such\
    \ as dishwashers, washers, dryers, refrigera-\ntors, freezers, stoves, water heaters,\
    \ trash compactors, ovens, and others (Estiri 2014).\nResidential buildings are\
    \ typically equipped with simple BAMSs that provide the basic \nrequirements of\
    \ building management for inhabitants’ well-being and comfort. Standard \nmanual\
    \ control is used for the most part of their BAMSs. For instance, the decentralized\
    \ \ncontrol of the indoor environment is driven by the thermal comfort levels\
    \ of the occupants. \nThermal comfort is subjective to outside weather conditions\
    \ that determine the indoor \nenvironment conditioning requirements, which are\
    \ heating or cooling, humidification or \ndehumidification, and air ventilation\
    \ (Do and Cetin 2018).\n3.3.2  Office buildings\nOffice buildings are where people\
    \ perform routine tasks, execute assignments and jobs \nfor their employers, or\
    \ provide passive or active, free of charge or remunerated ser-\nvices to the\
    \ public. Types of workplaces vary in the form and requirements of the work \n\
    and the variety of tools involved. Hence, they differ in size and the extent of\
    \ personnel \ninvolvement and expertise. Familiar workplaces are office buildings\
    \ such as law and \ncorporate firms, commercial companies, post offices, banks,\
    \ courtrooms, and similar \nplaces where people are involved in lengthy desk jobs\
    \ or light-weight activities. Most \nof the spaces are offices, meeting rooms,\
    \ or auditoriums of defined capacities. Addi-\ntionally, they have shared areas\
    \ such as corridors and lobbies. Office buildings require \nflexible and technologically-advanced\
    \ working environments that are safe, healthy, \npleasant, durable, and accessible\
    \ towards promoting the users’ comfort, productivity, \nand working efficiency\
    \ (Tanabe et  al. 2013). It includes the accessibility to natural \nventilation\
    \ and natural lighting sources, and the availability of IEQ control and moni-\n\
    toring. The provision of localized indoor environment control allows users to\
    \ adjust \nthe air temperature, air movement, and other relevant indoor environment\
    \ properties \naccording to their preferences. They are characterized by their\
    \ moderate operation \nschedules, and fairly regular and established user profiles.\
    \ Additionally, some work-\nspaces may involve many service recipients (Alsalemi\
    \ et al.).\n3.3.3  Healthcare centers\nThe indoor environment in healthcare centers\
    \ is critical for the health, well-being, \nsafety, and comfort of patients, visitors,\
    \ and the staff, as well as for the medical utili-\nties and services. It has\
    \ to comply with specific standards related to temperature, infec-\ntion, and\
    \ odor control (Salonen et al. 2013). It plays a significant role in the quality\
    \ of \n 4948\nY. Himeur et al.\n1 3\nthe provided medical service in terms of\
    \ the treatment, healing, recovery processes, \nand the success of the conducted\
    \ operations and procedures.\nThe various spaces in healthcare centers have different\
    \ temperature regulation \nrequirements. For instance, the success of surgical\
    \ procedures depends in part upon \nthe cold indoor conditions of the operating\
    \ room to avoid the risks of anesthetic explo-\nsions, promote the comfort, productivity,\
    \ and efficiency of the staff, and conserve the \npatient’s resources (Ellis 1963).\
    \ On the other hand, burn units are regulated at temper-\natures between 28 and\
    \ 33 degrees because burn injuries restrict the ability of patients’ \nbodies\
    \ to stay warm (Fernández and Pablo 2021). Moreover, healthcare centers require\
    \ \na clean and sterile environment. Hospital-acquired infections are a major\
    \ threat in \nhealthcare centers (Lobdell et al. 2012). Hence, air ventilation\
    \ and infection control \nare essential to control the potential contaminants\
    \ and other suspended microorgan-\nisms, consequently lowering airborne disease\
    \ risk. Additionally, air ventilation helps \ndispel odors, which improves the\
    \ indoor conditions for the patients, staff, and visitors. \nMoreover, medical\
    \ waste disposal and management is an essential aspect of the opera-\ntion of\
    \ healthcare centers as they are considered one of the main sites for the genera-\n\
    tion of hazardous waste (Aljabre 2002). The proper management of medical waste\
    \ is \nessential to avoid health and environmental risks. Healthcare centers have\
    \ protocols for \nthe disposal of the generated waste according to their location.\
    \ Additionally, health-\ncare centers are obliged to provide adequate security\
    \ implementations for (i) the safety \nof patients, the public, and staff, (ii)\
    \ the privacy and integrity of the patients’ data, (iii) \nthe prevention of breaches\
    \ against the BAMS, (iv) the management of the utilities and \nequipment, and\
    \ (v) the prevention of injuries and unwanted occurrences.\n3.3.4  Sports facilities\n\
    Sports facilities involve areas where individuals or groups engage in physical\
    \ exercise, \nparticipate in athletic competitions, or attend sporting events.\
    \ Examples of sports facilities \nare gymnasiums, cultural centers, stadiums,\
    \ swimming pools, indoor and outdoor tennis \ncourts, squash courts, training\
    \ halls, and sports arenas. They encompass large and various \nspaces involving\
    \ different types of activities. Sports facilities have distinct requirements\
    \ for \nair conditioning and ventilation, thermal comfort, and lighting with unique\
    \ usage and occu-\npancy patterns. They are governed by the type of sports activity,\
    \ the operating time, the \nseason, and the geographical location of the facility\
    \ (Trianti-Stourna et al. 1998).\nSports facilities are characterized by the variety\
    \ of their architectural sophistication \nand sizes, deployed technologies, and\
    \ their distinctive energy demand profile compared to \nother types of buildings\
    \ (Elnour et al. 2022). For instance, stadiums are the most sophis-\nticated ones,\
    \ which occupy vast land space. Even though they are often infrequently used,\
    \ \ntheir operation and running costs during a single event are substantial (Aquino\
    \ and Nawari \n2015). Aquatic centers are the second most popular sports facilities\
    \ that host different water \nevents and tournaments. They encompass other spaces\
    \ such as changing rooms, shower \nrooms, and storage rooms.\nSustainability measures\
    \ and implementation are deployed in sports facilities’ design, \nconstruction,\
    \ and operations. They require extensive lighting, air conditioning, broadcast-\n\
    ing, surveillance, and security requirements when operated to achieve successful\
    \ sports \nevents. The proper lighting in the sports facilities ensures good visual\
    \ conditions. The \nevent’s prosperous broadcasting is essential to delivering\
    \ an entertaining, thrilling, and \nengaging experience for the athletes and fans.\
    \ Given the considerable volume of user flow \n4949\nAI‑big data analytics for building\
    \ automation and management…\n1 3\nin sports facilities, emergency evacuation\
    \ planning, users’ entry and exit management, \nsecurity screening, and preventive\
    \ measures are among the top priorities in sports facili-\nties management (Hall\
    \ et al. 2011). Additionally, sports facilities involve extensive body \nworkouts\
    \ and activity by the users, during which excessive heat and CO2 discharge occur.\
    \ \nThey demand mainly air conditioning and ventilation, especially for indoor\
    \ sports events \nas well as water heating for pools and domestic use to maintain\
    \ the comfort, health, and \nwell-being of the users. Moreover, sports facilities\
    \ require constant maintenance, servicing, \nand overseeing even when not used,\
    \ such as grass fields, pools, water treatment, and sports \nequipment.\n3.3.5\
    \  Commercial buildings\nCommercial buildings have at least 50% of their floor\
    \ spaces for commercial activities \n(Kiliccote and Piette), such as malls, retail,\
    \ and food services. Malls and restaurants are \ntypical commercial buildings\
    \ of various sizes and complexity. They include shops, cafes, \nkitchens with\
    \ several commercial appliances, storage rooms, pantries, a refrigerated space,\
    \ \noffices, dining areas, and public restrooms. They demand maintaining a clean\
    \ and well-\nconditioned environment. For example, in restaurants and coffee shops,\
    \ compliance with \nproper food storage and preparation standards is required\
    \ to reduce the risk of spoiling food \nand eliminate the risk of incidents jeopardizing\
    \ the well-being of the users as well as the \nreputation of the restaurants (El-Sharkawy\
    \ and Javed 2018).\nAir ventilation affects the health and safety of workers and\
    \ customers and can influence \nfood sanitation levels. The chiefs and the kitchen\
    \ staff in restaurants are exposed to air pol-\nlutants generated from cooking\
    \ for long periods. Hence, they may suffer potential respira-\ntory and cardiovascular\
    \ problems in the long run (Juntarawijit and Juntarawijit 2017). Also, \nthey\
    \ are subjected to high levels of heat generated from cooking activities, decreasing\
    \ the \nstaff’s productivity. Additionally, excessive unpleasant odors or poor\
    \ air conditioning in \nrestaurants can result in an unpleasant experience for\
    \ the customers. In addition, malls and \nshopping centers are commercial buildings\
    \ where goods or services are sold to customers. \nThey may include ample parking\
    \ spaces, escalators, elevators, and various outlets such as \ndepartment stores,\
    \ food courts, amusement and theme parks, and movie theaters. Safe and \ncomfortable\
    \ indoor conditions are essential to provide a convenient and enjoyable experi-\n\
    ence for users and maintain a flourishing business with efficient energy consumption\
    \ to \ncontain the incurred running and operating costs.\nCommercial buildings\
    \ are famous for their exceptional operating schedule and occu-\npancy patterns.\
    \ They run for about more than 12 hours all week, and they have peak occu-\npancy\
    \ during weekends and significant volumes of user flow. They utilize extensive\
    \ closed-\ncircuit television (CCTV) surveillance, lighting, and air ventilation\
    \ and conditioning \nsystems. Additionally, fire prevention, suspension, and other\
    \ security and alarm systems \nare crucial elements of their management systems\
    \ to ensure dependable and safe circum-\nstances for the users. Overly, the proper\
    \ management of commercial buildings is essential \nto maintain a lucrative operation.\n\
    3.3.6  Industrial buildings\nIndustrial buildings include buildings used for the\
    \ generation and distribution of power, \nmanufacturing products such as food,\
    \ apparel, electronics, petrochemicals, construc-\ntion materials, automobiles,\
    \ the processing of raw materials, and many others. They have \n 4950\nY. Himeur\
    \ et al.\n1 3\nminimal and relatively low user flow for security purposes, such\
    \ that they are only acces-\nsible to individuals with privileges. However, they\
    \ involve energy-intensive and delicate \nmachinery. They are generally equipped\
    \ with sophisticated BAMSs that support the secu-\nrity and the centralized control\
    \ requirements. Industrial buildings are equipped with robot-\nics, industrial\
    \ devices, and software-defined production processes. They require a high \nlevel\
    \ of automation, given the nature of the processes involved and the tasks performed.\
    \ \nIn addition, they may involve delicate processes that are associated with\
    \ health, social, and \nenvironmental risks. Industrial sites and environments\
    \ can result in air and water pollution \ndue to the generated by-products and\
    \ the released unwanted toxins of the occurring pro-\ncesses. Hazards from combustion\
    \ and unstable reactions can lead to highly harmful acci-\ndents due to the sudden\
    \ release of material at high temperatures or pressures (Englund \n2007). Additionally,\
    \ fire hazards are common in industrial facilities, which can endanger \nthe lives\
    \ of staff and can result in substantial economic losses and environmental implica-\n\
    tions. Industrial facilities must be safe, secure, and productive. Proper process\
    \ control, air \nventilation, treatment and conditioning, and waste management\
    \ are crucial to managing the \nsafety and health of the staff as well as the\
    \ general public and the surrounding environment. \nSecurity is an essential dimension\
    \ in the operation of the BAMSs of industrial buildings.\n3.3.7  Academic buildings\n\
    Academic buildings are used to conduct teaching activities such as schools, academies,\
    \ \nuniversities, colleges, technical institutes, etc. They encompass classrooms,\
    \ lecture halls, \nlibraries, student centers, dining halls, laboratories, computer\
    \ labs, offices, and service \nareas necessary for the proper functioning of the\
    \ academic programs. Individuals of vari-\nous age groups are frequent users of\
    \ educational facilities, and they engage in multiple \ntypes of activities. A\
    \ convenient and safe environment in academic facilities is an essen-\ntial requirement\
    \ for the education process. It affects the well-being and comfort of stu-\ndents,\
    \ faculty members, and other staff, hence their productivity and working efficiency.\
    \ A \ncomfortable and safe environment has been identified as an essential element\
    \ for enhanc-\ning the learning of students (Muhammad et al. 2014). Over-heated\
    \ and poorly ventilated \nclassrooms can result in the discomfort of students\
    \ and educators, and consequently diverts \ntheir attention and affects their\
    \ abilities to concentrate (Roelofsen). Adequate lighting in \nthe facilities\
    \ of academic buildings is vital to the comfort and well-being of the students\
    \ to \ncreate an attractive and engaging learning environment and avoid eye strain.\
    \ Additionally, \nstudents’ health and well-being are essential for their learning\
    \ process. The indoor environ-\nment influences students’ attendance and hence\
    \ their study. Students need to be in good \nhealth to be able to study well.\
    \ Therefore, spaces in academic buildings should be well \nconditioned and ventilated\
    \ to avoid altering users’ well-being, spreading airborne diseases \nspread, and\
    \ disrupting students’ learning. Lastly, a brief summary is presented in Table 2\
    \ to \ncompare the characteristics of the different buildings discussed above.\n\
    3.4  Computing platforms\n3.4.1  Cloud computing\nThe advancement of cloud computing\

    \ to different cloud-\nbased services (Alsalemi et al. 2020). The latter can provide\
    \ data storage, connectivity, and \npowerful computing resources. To that end,\
    \ significant efforts have been devoted to devel-\noping cloud-based big data\
    \ analytics solutions in BAMSs (Bode et al. 2019). For instance, \na voice-activated\
    \ system for remotely monitoring BAMSs using cloud computing is pre-\nsented in\
    \ Valenzuela et al. (2013). While in Khattak et al. (2019), the idea of developing\
    \ \nvehicular clouds for smart buildings and smart city applications is investigated.\
    \ Moving \non, in Stergiou et al. (2018), the security and privacy concerns along\
    \ with the efficiency of \ncloud platforms are analyzed. In Delsing (2017), local\
    \ cloud IoT automation is studied to \npromote the use of distributed IoT automation\
    \ solutions.\nDespite the significant effort made during the last decade to promote\
    \ the use of cloud-\nservices to run BAMSs, some drawbacks are still causing issues\
    \ to users and operators, \namong them (i) the increased cost and communication\
    \ overheads, (ii) the privacy and secu-\nrity concerns, especially when private\
    \ data is transmitted to a centralized server for pro-\ncessing (Mohamed et al.\
    \ 2018).\n3.4.2  Edge computing\nEdge computing it refers to performing data pre-processing,\
    \ data fusion for different \nsources and AI-big data analytics at the edge of\
    \ the network i.e. sensor nodes (Ray et al. \n2019). Also, it enables optimizing\
    \ cloud computing platforms due to its capability to use \nthe processing power\
    \ of IoT devices for filtering, pre-processing, aggregating and storing \nIoT\
    \ sensor data. These tasks can correspondingly be conducted in real-time using\
    \ conveni-\nent analytical tools (Sharma et al. 2018), while cloud platforms perform\
    \ further enrich-\nment, aggregation and running complex analytics on the filtered\
    \ data. To that end, the new \nadvances in BAMSs combined with the latest generation\
    \ of IoT devices make it possible \nto bring the intelligence and computing tasks\
    \ to the edge nodes in close proximity to the \nbuilding’s IoT devices (Zakharchenko\
    \ and Stepanets 2019; Khan et al. 2020). Moreover, a \nnew generation of open\
    \ software platforms hosted on edge nodes are enabling access to the \nbuilding\
    \ data and advanced AI-big analytics deployed on these platforms are providing\
    \ the \ntechnology to create value from this data by transforming data from building\
    \ environments \ninto actionable information. Various open edge platforms have\
    \ recently been proposed, e.g. \nIOTech’s Edge Xpert,3 Echelon SmartServer IoT\
    \ platform,4 JENEsys Edge,5 etc.\n3.4.3  Fog computing\nFog computing represents\
    \ a decentralized computing strategy where data storage, data \nprocessing and\
    \ computing resources are located in the middle layer situated between edge \n\
    devices and cloud. Typically, IoT smart sensors and submeters periodically collect\
    \ the data \nand forward it to a gateway that acts as a fog device (Javadzadeh\
    \ and Rahmani 2020). In \nthis line, BAMSs can benefit from streaming data over\
    \ a layer of fog devices (or nodes) to \nbecome more connected, where data can\
    \ be analyzed to detect abnormalities for example, \nand autonomously react, if\
    \ authorized, for compensating the problems or fixing the issues. \nOtherwise,\
    \ fog nodes will send the convenient requests to the cloud (or services higher\

    \ using com-\nplex ML models (Ferrández-Pastor et al. 2018; Aazam et al. 2018).\n\
    For instance, in some situations that require real-time decision-making, e.g.\
    \ shut down \nappliances or equipment before being damaged or adjust crucial process\
    \ parameters, edge \ndevices or fog nodes can rapidly act with millisecond-level\
    \ latency, while it is not possi-\nble to reach real-time decision making using\
    \ cloud data centers (Rocha Filho et al. 2018). \nTherefore, the use of fog computing\
    \ or edge computing helps avoid potential latency prob-\nlems, delays an/or network/server\
    \ down-times that can lead to different kinds of accidents \nor reduced service\
    \ optimization and efficiency (Maatoug et al. 2019).\n3.4.4  Hybrid computing\n\
    Hybrid computing refers to the case when the aforementioned computing architectures,\
    \ i.e. \nedge computing, fog computing and cloud computing, are used together\
    \ to process and \nanalyze data (Himeur et al. 2021; Zhang et al. 2020). In this\
    \ context, based on the appli-\ncation scenario and computation requirement, some\
    \ data processing tasks could be made \nat the edge devices and/or fog nodes,\
    \ while high-level data processing tasks (e.g. feature \nextraction, classification,\
    \ anomaly detection, etc.) could be performed at the cloud data \ncenters (Himeur\
    \ et al. 2020).\n3.5  Applications\n3.5.1  Facility and asset management\nFacility\
    \ management to eliminate waste is among the benefits of using AI-big data analyt-\n\
    ics in BAMSs and can perform in diverse forms. For instance, using an AI strategy,\
    \ a bath-\nroom supplies monitoring company has saved up to 40% in of the total\
    \ cost by installing \na sensors that collect and send information about the utilization\
    \ levels of toilet paper rolls \nand soaps (Gaboalapswe 2019; Sayed et al. 2022).\
    \ Similar techniques are also be deployed \nfor monitoring sports facilities,\
    \ commercial buildings, office supplies, and other building \nnecessities (Himeur\
    \ et al. 2021; Idowu et al. 2016).\nFor instance, in sports facilities there is\
    \ an emergency to improve the BAMS services to \nmeet consumer’s growing experience\
    \ needs, and hence, overcome various issues, e.g. poor \nresource sharing, weak\
    \ flexibility of response and slow transmission of information, and \ninstability\
    \ of aero-thermal comfort, which are considerable affecting the end-users’ expe-\n\
    rience and restricting the development of sport venues (Zhong et al. 2020). To\
    \ that end, \na great attention has been put recently to design intelligent BAMS\
    \ architectures of sport \ncenters. This helps in interconnecting multiple subsystems,\
    \ improving the interoperability, \nintegrating information, realizing the integration\
    \ of data application network, and achieves \nthe goal of resource sharing and\
    \ function upgrading. In Xiao-wei (2020), an AI-big data \nanalytics platform\
    \ is built using SVM-back propagation neural network (SVM-BPNN) \nfor (i) predicting\
    \ the end-user flow in the sport facility, (ii) providing recommendations \nto\
    \ adjust the service plan, and (iii) improving the overall management and the\
    \ end-users’ \n 4956\nY. Himeur et al.\n1 3\nexperience. Moving on, in Wan et al.\
    \ (2021), as the cyber-security is a challenging issue \nin sports facilities\
    \ due to the number of spectators and players and the large number of \nsport\
    \ events organized, an AI-assisted cyber-physical system (AI-CPS) is integrated\
    \ to the \nBAMS for promoting network security and predicting cyber attacks and\
    \ adversaries.\nOn the other hand, because developing an appropriate setpoint\
    \ temperature for the \nHVAC system is a crucial challenge, the authors in Aparicio-Ruiz\
    \ et al. (2021) identify \nsuch temperature using a KNN-based dynamic adaptive\
    \ comfort technique. It relies on the \nidea that occupants’ thermal comfort in\
    \ a building has different acceptability levels, which \ncan be used for learning\
    \ the comfort temperature corresponding to the average running \ntemperature.\
    \ Thus, this helps define the adequate range of indoor temperature. While in \n\
    Carreira et al. (2018), Carreira et al. introduce a framework for tracking building\
    \ end-users’ \ngroup preferences, learning from them, and automatically managing\
    \ HVAC systems. This \nframework is built by tracking building users using an\
    \ RFID card, interacting with them on \na mobile app, computing setpoints, and\
    \ sending instructions to the HVAC sub-system over \na gateway. Additionally,\
    \ a K-means algorithm has been used for configuring the setpoint, in \nline with\
    \ a prediction based on the current building status.\n3.5.2  Load forecasting\n\
    In BAMSs, forecasting energy consumption is of significant importance to enable\
    \ an effec-\ntive management of energy, in which AI-big data analytics techniques\
    \ play an essential \nrole. In doing so, load patterns (and ambient conditions)\
    \ are constantly collected from \ndiverse building smart-meters and then fed into\
    \ the AI models to predict energy usage. \nBecause of the real-time characteristic\
    \ of short-term forecasting, it has been more chal-\nlenging than generic forecasting.\
    \ Thus, various AI-big data analytics models have been \nproposed (Chou and Tran\
    \ 2018; Ahmad and Chen 2018; Seyedzadeh et al. 2018; Fathi \net al. 2020). In\
    \ Pham et al. (2020), a random forests (RF) model is introduced to perform a \n\
    short-term energy load prediction at an hourly sampling rate in various buildings\
    \ by using \ndifferent energy consumption datasets. In Seyedzadeh et al. (2019),\
    \ the authors investigate \nthe performance of diverse popular ML algorithms to\
    \ predict buildings heating and cooling \nenergy usage. Accordingly, specific\
    \ tuning has been carried out for every ML algorithm \nusing two building energy\
    \ consumption datasets generated in EnergyPlus and Ecotect. In \nRibeiro et al.\
    \ (2018), a transfer learning based load prediction scheme is introduced, where\
    \ \nenergy consumption data of different buildings are used to forecast the load\
    \ of a new build-\ning. This approach can work with various ML algorithms with\
    \ pre- and post-processing \nphases.\nIn Moon et al. (2018), Moon et al. propose\
    \ an energy prediction model using diverse \nML models, including ANN, SVR, and\
    \ PCA-factor analysis (PCA-FA). Data from four \nbuildings in an academic institution\
    \ have been used for evaluating the performance of \nthese models. In Ahmad et al.\
    \ (2020), an intelligent load prediction scheme is proposed \nusing generated\
    \ sampled data-based Gaussian process regression model (GSD-GPRM), \nregression\
    \ binary decision tree (RBDT), bootstrap bagging of regression trees (BBRT) and\
    \ \nbinary multiclass classification decision tree (BMCDT). In Idowu et al. (2016),\
    \ supervised \nML algorithms are used to develop a load forecasting model using\
    \ SVM, regression tree, \nfeed-forward neural network (FFNN), and multiple linear\
    \ regression (MLR). Moving on, \nin Ahmad et al. (2018), diverse supervised ML\
    \ models are implemented to predict energy \nconsumption at short, medium, and\
    \ long-term levels in different building environments, \n4957\nAI‑big data analytics\
    \ for building automation and management…\n1 3\nnamely compact regression Gaussian\
    \ process (CRGP), binary decision tree (BDT), gen-\neralized linear regression\
    \ model (GLRM) and stepwise Gaussian processes regression \n(SGPR). In Chou and\
    \ Ngo (2016), a short-term based energy prediction system is proposed \nusing\
    \ a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model along with\
    \ \na metaheuristic firefly algorithm-based least squares support vector regression\
    \ (MetaFA-\nLSSVR) model. Typically, this framework uses (i) the SARIMA architecture\
    \ for linearing \nenergy observations, and (ii) the MetaFA-LSSVR model for capturing\
    \ nonlinear energy \npatterns.\nIn Li et al. (2021), a transfer-learning-based\
    \ ANN scheme is developed to predict \nshort-term energy consumption in information-poor\
    \ buildings. The efficiency of trans-\nfer learning in improving the prediction\
    \ accuracy has been demonstrated using limited \ntraining data. Moving on, in\
    \ Grolinger et al. (2016), a short-term energy consumption \nprediction of sports\
    \ facilities, which is considered as a challenging scenario due to the \nvariations\
    \ caused by by the hosted events, is performed using NN and SVR. In Zheng \net al.\
    \ (2017), a short-term energy prediction approach using an empirical mode decom-\n\
    position (EMD)-LSTM-based RNN is proposed with a Xgboost model to select feature\
    \ \npatterns based on a feature importance evaluation. In a similar manner, in\
    \ Haq et al. \n(2021), a sequential learning-based load forecasting algorithm\
    \ is developed and used \nin both residential and commercial buildings. Accordingly,\
    \ this framework implements \na convLSTM integrated with BiLSTM (ConvLSTM-BiLSTM)\
    \ and compares its perfor-\nmance with various sequential models, including ConvLSTM\
    \ integrated with BiLSTM, \nLSTM, auto-encoder (AE), multi-layer Bi-LSTM (MBiLSTM),\
    \ BiLSTM-AE, GRU, \nand CNN with multilayer bidirectional GRU (CNN-MB-GRU). Fig. \
    \ 4 illustrates a \nflowchart of an energy forecasting system based on AI-big\
    \ data analytics. Specifically, \na short-term energy consumption prediction is\
    \ performed using EMD-LSTM neural \nnetworks with a Xgboost algorithm to extract\
    \ importance features. Besides, Moradza-\ndeh et al. (2020) propose a heating\
    \ and cooling load forecasting scheme that is based \non MLP and SVR in residential\
    \ buildings. These models help identify a linear map-\nping between inputs and\
    \ outputs. MLP has outperformed SVR in terms of the recall \nmetric, where a recall\
    \ of 99.93% has been achieved. To summarize, Table 3 compares \nvarious AI-Big\
    \ data analytics frameworks used for energy forecasting, in terms of AI \nmodel,\
    \ forecast horizon, building environment, year of appearance, method description\
    \ \nand evaluation metrics.\n3.5.3  Energy efficiency\nOne area that can get immensely\
    \ benefited from AI-big data analytics is energy effi-\nciency in buildings. This\
    \ is because of the way a building consumes energy can be \nquite variable, and\
    \ is related to various parameters, e.g. the nature of the building, \nthe energy\
    \ provider, the sources of the energy, the number of devices, the number of \n\
    end-users/occupants in any building, the behavior of end-users/occupants, etc.\
    \ Himeur \net al. (2021); Fatema et al. (2020). Moreover, comprehending the energy\
    \ consumption \nhabits of a building is the first and most critical step to achieve\
    \ energy efficiency. This \nway, AI-big data analytics and energy efficiency can\
    \ go hand in hand towards the goal \nof optimizing energy consumption and reducing\
    \ the amount of wasted energy without \ncompromising the comfort level of end-users\
    \ and the level of efficiency and productiv-\nity in a company or industry Sardianos\
    \ et al. (2021).\n 4958\nY. Himeur et al.\n1 3\nIn (Yu and Chiller), Yu et al.\
    \ propose an open IoT cloud-based ML system, namely \nAI Chiller, to promote energy\
    \ efficiency in buildings by optimizing the consumption of \nthe HVAC system.\
    \ An AI-big data analytics scheme based on an RNN-LSTM architec-\nture and to\
    \ analyzing and fusing BAMS environmental footprints has been developed \nand\
    \ combined with a genetic algorithm to achieve 10% savings. In Al-Ali et al. (2017),\
    \ \nenergy saving in residential buildings in the Gulf region is achieved using\
    \ IoT, off-the-\nshelf business intelligence, and big data analytics platforms.\n\
    3.5.4  Predictive control and thermal comfort\nOne solution to save buildings’\
    \ energy is using model predictive control (MPC). It aims at \ndeveloping predictive\
    \ models for (i) simulating input-output interactions; and (ii) helping \nusers\
    \ to identify optimum control actions that drive the predicted outputs to the\
    \ desired \nreferences. In this context, ML models predict energy demand and simulate\
    \ MPC con-\ntrol techniques to save energy and optimize end-users’ comfort. Typically,\
    \ these models \ncan provide decision bases for selecting optimal MPC control\
    \ actions Serale et al. (2018); \nMariano-Hernández et al. (2021). In Gao et al.\
    \ (2020), building thermal comfort control \nis conducted using RL, where a deep\
    \ feed-forward neural network (FNN)-based method \nis introduced. The latter helps\
    \ predict consumers’ thermal comfort before introducing a \ndeep deterministic\
    \ policy gradients (DDPGs)-based scheme to optimize thermal comfort. \nIn Yang\
    \ et al. (2020), an MPC approach based on an RNN with nonlinear autoregressive\
    \ \nexogenous (NARX) architecture, namely NARX-RNN, is proposed to optimize air\
    \ con-\nditioning and mechanical ventilation (ACMV) in a hospital office and hence\
    \ save energy \nand optimize thermal comfort. Similarly, in Yang et al. (2021),\
    \ the same methodology is \nexperimentally implemented to control the ACMV systems\
    \ in office and lecture theatre \n(LT) testbeds in real-time. In Chen et al. (2020),\
    \ Chen et al. developed an MPC approach \nbased on deep transfer learning to optimize\
    \ the HVAC operation in smart buildings.\nMoving forward, in Bünning et al. (2020),\
    \ an RF-based data predictive control (DPC) \nscheme is proposed using convex\
    \ optimization and affine functions. This help in controlling \nFig. 4  Flowchart\

    energy consumption and temperature in a room of a real-life apartment. In Yang\
    \ and Wan \n(2022), Yang et al., RNN-NARX-based MPC is introduced with instantaneous\
    \ lineariza-\ntion for ACMV optimization. Table  4 summarizes some of the recent\
    \ ML-based MPC \nframeworks described above, their characteristics, and their\
    \ contributions. Most concen-\ntrate on controlling HVAC and ACMV systems in buildings\
    \ since they consume the most \nsignificant proportion of building energy. Thus,\
    \ this significantly impacts the thermal com-\nfort of buildings’ occupants.\n\
    3.5.5  Anomaly and fault detection and diagnosis\nFailures in building electric\
    \ networks and devices’ operation cycles may result in exces-\nsive energy losses\
    \ and extra costs. To alleviate these issues, AI-big data analytics are a \nprevalent\
    \ tool that enables detecting faults and disturbances early enough and predicting\
    \ \nmaintenance. That is possible by implementing continuous energy consumption\
    \ monitor-\ning to create ”an early warning system” empowered with AI-big data\
    \ analytics strategies \nand pattern recognition models to notify the end-users\
    \ and operators Alsalemi et al. (2020). \nAccordingly, information related to\
    \ energy consumption, environmental conditions, and \noccupancy patterns is fed\
    \ into the AI black-boxes to identify and classify deviations. Once \ndeviations\
    \ are classified, their causes are determined before taking appropriate measures\
    \ \nfor their prevention Himeur et al. (2020), Alsalemi et al. (2020).\nIn this\
    \ regard, a plethora of AI-based frameworks have been proposed to develop AI-\n\
    big data analytics platforms that allow building energy efficiency Himeur et al.\
    \ (2021). \nIn Himeur et al. (2020), a DNN model and the micro-moment concept\
    \ have been used \nto identify energy consumption deviations. A micro-moment rule-based\
    \ algorithm is \nemployed to extract load features of daily intent-driven energy\
    \ usage moments. Next, \nDNN is applied to classify and determine abnormal consumption\
    \ classes automatically \nand then compare the performance with various scenarios\
    \ using conventional ML clas-\nsifiers, e.g. LR, LDA, NB, SVM, RF, KNN, DT, ensemble\
    \ classifier, and MLP. Simi-\nlarly, in Himeur et al. (2021), unsupervised and\
    \ supervised anomaly detection schemes \nare introduced to promote energy saving\
    \ in academic and residential buildings. OCSVM \nis applied to extract abnormal\
    \ energy consumption patterns from unlabeled data, while \nan improved kNN classifier\
    \ is proposed to process annotated consumption footprints \nthat are benchmarked\
    \ using the micro-moment concept. In Xu and Chen (2020), a \nhybrid model using\
    \ RNNs with quantile regression (QR) is proposed for anomaly detec-\ntion in residential\
    \ houses towards improving the performance of the building and reduc-\ning energy\
    \ waste (Table 5).\nAdditionally, fault detection and diagnosis in HVAC systems,\
    \ being the most exten-\nsively operated equipment, has been covered widely in\
    \ the literature. For instance, the uti-\nlization of the different configurations\
    \ of deep RNNs is investigated in Taheri et al. (2021) \nto perform fault detection\
    \ and diagnosis of common HVAC system faults, such as the mal-\nfunction and leakage\
    \ of valves and dampers and sensor bias faults. A comparative study is \npresented\
    \ comparing the performance of a DRNN-based diagnosis approach with RF and \n\
    GB algorithms. In Yun et al. (2021), a neural network-based supervised auto-encoder\
    \ (NN-\nSAE) - which is an auto-encoder with two outputs that are the classification\
    \ label and the \nreconstructed signal- is proposed for air handling units fault\
    \ detection and diagnosis before \nits validation using ASHRAE experimental data.\
    \ The two outputs of the NN-SAE have \nbeen then processed to determine the diagnosis\
    \ decision reliability. This approach has been \n 4964\nY. Himeur et al.\n1 3\n\

    AI‑big data analytics for building automation and management…\n1 3\ncompared with\
    \ conventional ANN and SVM algorithms, and it has been found reliable as it \n\
    considers undefined situations.\nAdditionally, a 2D CNN-based HVAC system actuator\
    \ fault diagnosis is introduced in \nElnour and Meskin, in which the system’s\
    \ measurements and control signals were con-\nfigured into multi-channel images\
    \ and then processed using the 2D CNN-based diagno-\nsis framework. CNNs are characterized\
    \ by their high-performance accuracy and powerful \ncapability in learning and\
    \ realizing complex functions and interdependency from any given \ndata. While\
    \ in Liu et al. (2021), a CNN-based chiller fault diagnosis method is developed\
    \ \nfor building energy systems. Additionally, a TRL-based scheme is assessed\
    \ to investigate \nthe potential of using a pre-trained CNN-based fault diagnosis\
    \ approach for chillers with \ndifferent specifications, which is useful when\
    \ available data is limited in size and/or types \nof operating conditions/faults\
    \ captured.\nIn Dey et al. (2020), a big-data framework is presented to enable\
    \ automated HVAC sys-\ntem fault diagnosis in large scale buildings in which a\
    \ feature extraction approach is pro-\nposed to reduce the data dimensionality,\
    \ and a multi-class SVM (MCSVM) algorithm is \nutilized to develop the diagnosis\
    \ model. It aims to provide energy savings through preemp-\ntive maintenance,\
    \ behavior analysis, and predictive building identification. In Bode et al. \n\
    (2020), various ML algorithms are investigated to perform fault detection on a\
    \ heat pump \nsystem, which are LR, kNN, classification and regression tree (CART),\
    \ RF, NB, SVM, and \nNNs. This study demonstrates the effect of the data quality\
    \ and amount and the limitations \non the system’s features availability (i.e,\
    \ types of available sensors) on the performance of \nthe developed ML models.\
    \ While in Han et al. (2020), a supervised hybrid fault diagnosis \nmodel using\
    \ SVM, kNN, and RF is developed for chiller fault diagnosis such that the three\
    \ \nmodels are developed independently to perform fault diagnosis; then the final\
    \ decision is \nmade based on the plurality voting method. It was found that ensemble\
    \ learning contributes \nto diagnostic performance improvements. In Li et al.\
    \ (2021), a fault diagnosis approach \nis proposed for the common component faults\
    \ in the HVAC system of an office building \nusing a modified GAN. The proposed\
    \ approach enables leveraging the labeled and unla-\nbeled data simultaneously\
    \ such that it aims to process the unlabeled data and utilize the \nlimited information\
    \ from the labeled ones to conclude the diagnosis decision.\nThose fault diagnosis\
    \ approaches mainly require sufficient labeled data for training, \nwhich can\
    \ be unavailable or complex, and costly to obtain. Therefore, several studies\
    \ have \ndeveloped unsupervised and semi-supervised diagnosis strategies as in\
    \ Elnour et al. (2020), \nwhere an auto-associative neural network (AANN) is utilized\
    \ for sensor data validation \nand fault diagnosis in HVAC systems using semi-supervised\
    \ learning. It demonstrates a \ncompelling performance in sensor error correction,\
    \ data replacement of unavailable sen-\nsors, measurement noise reduction, and\
    \ sensor inaccuracy correction. Also, it is effective \nfor both single and multiple\
    \ sensor faults diagnoses. In Zhu et al. (2021), transfer learning \nis applied\
    \ to develop a chiller fault diagnosis approach that only requires the system’s\
    \ nor-\nmal operation data using domain adversarial neural network (DANN). While\
    \ in Shahnaz-\nari et al. (2019), a distributed diagnosis approach using RNNs\
    \ utilizing the normal system \noperation data is developed for multiple sensors\
    \ and actuator faults diagnosis. It is based on \ndeveloping intercommunicating\
    \ fault detection and isolation (LFDI) agents for the various \nHVAC subsystems,\
    \ i.e., cooling coil, VAV box, etc., and each LFDI agent is composed of \ntwo\
    \ RNN-based models. It demonstrates promising capability in fault diagnosis. However,\
    \ \nit is excessively computationally demanding, given the two RNN-based models\
    \ included in \neach agent.\nAdditionally, a multi-level automatic fault detection\
    \ framework is proposed in Dey \net al. (2020) for fan coil units (FCUs). Feature\
    \ extraction followed by data clustering are \n 4970\nY. Himeur et al.\n1 3\n\
    applied to identify faulty and healthy data, and then a clustering-based fault\
    \ diagnosis \nmodel is developed. The least-squares support vector machine (LS-SVM)\
    \ regression model \nis used in Han et al. (2019) to develop a chiller fault diagnosis\
    \ strategy that is validated \nusing ASHRAE data. The proposed approach is compared\
    \ with two other methods using \nthe SVM algorithm of probabilistic neural networks\
    \ (PNNs). In Choi and Yoon (2021), \na semi-supervised fault diagnosis approach\
    \ is proposed for building automation systems \nusing NN-based auto-encoders (AEs).\
    \ An AE is a structure that transfers the input to the \nlatent space then uses\
    \ the compressed representation to produce a reconstructed version at \nthe output.\
    \ Variants of the proposed method are investigated: the residual-based approach\
    \ \nusing the error between the original and the reconstructed signal as the indication\
    \ of the \nsystem status, and the latest space-based approach in which the features\
    \ of the compressed \nrepresentation are used for fault diagnosis.\n3.5.6  Indoor\
    \ environmental quality (IEQ) monitoring\nIEQ monitoring continues to grow in\
    \ importance, several works have demonstrated an \napparent relationship between\
    \ the increasing concentration of CO2 and decreasing cogni-\ntive performance\
    \ (Nejat et al. 2020; Pulimeno et al. 2020). Typically, monitoring ambient \n\
    IEQ and temperature can reveal valuable information for creating a healthier,\
    \ more com-\nfortable environment for end-users. It is also a prime opportunity\
    \ for energy and cost sav-\nings (Saini et al. 2020a). Thus it becomes possible,\
    \ using detailed AI analytics in BAMSs, \nto identify various environmental problems,\
    \ including air pollution, where different pollut-\nants may affect the IEQ ,\
    \ such as the cleaning products, cigarettes smoke, perfumes, con-\nstruction activities,\
    \ water-damaged building materials, and other types of outdoor pollut-\nants (Saini\
    \ et al. 2020b). Indeed, albeit these gazes are commonly safe for end-users, their\
    \ \neffect on human health can be dangerous if they exceed certain thresholds\
    \ of exposure. To \nthat end, an intelligent IEQ monitoring system for classifying\
    \ and recognizing diverse pol-\nlutants and measuring their levels is of utmost\
    \ importance (Wei et al. 2019; Muiruri et al. \n2021).\nBefore the COVID-19 outbreak,\
    \ IEQ monitoring was not a priority in public buildings, \ne.g. sport venues,\
    \ banks, healthcare centers, academic institutions, commercial centers, res-\n\
    taurants, and so on. However, the fast proliferation of the corona virus and its\
    \ resulting \nharmful effects have put IEQ in the spotlight as an important component\
    \ of BAMSs. In \nMumtaz et al. (2021), the authors (i) develop an IoT node including\
    \ various sensors for \ncollecting data, (ii) introduce a NN model for classifying\
    \ 8 pollutants, and (iii) design an \nLSTM-based DL model for predicting the concentration\
    \ of every pollutant and the overall \nIEQ. In Mad Saad et al. (2017), a pollutant\
    \ recognition scheme is proposed for IEQ moni-\ntoring using different supervised\
    \ ML algorithms, including MLP, KNN and linear discrim-\nination analysis (LDA).\
    \ The evaluation has been conducted in a residential building located \nin a rural\
    \ area in China, where 5 different indoor air pollutants were considered (combus-\n\
    tion activity, presence of chemicals, presence of food and beverages, ambient\
    \ air, and pres-\nence of fragrances). While in Loy-Benitez et al. (2020b), Loy\
    \ et al. introduce an ML-based \nscheme for detecting, diagnosing, identifying,\
    \ and reconstructing abnormal observations \nof multivariate IEQ data in a subway\
    \ station. Accordingly, a memory-gated RNN-based \nautoencoders (MG-RNN-AE) that\
    \ can process dynamic and sequential IEQ data has been \nutilized.\nIn Cruz et al.\
    \ (2020), an IEQ prediction model is developed using SVM radial basis func-\n\
    tion (SVM-RBF) and stochastic Gradient Boosting machines (SGBM). The performance\
    \ of \n4971\nAI‑big data analytics for building automation and management…\n1\
    \ 3\nof these models has been evaluated using root mean squared error (RMSE) and\
    \ R2 , and a \ncomparison with other ML algorithms has been presented. In Taştan\
    \ and Gökozan (2019), \na real-time IEQ monitoring system is designed using and\
    \ IoT-based e-nose and diverse ML \nclassifiers, including SVR, generalized regression\
    \ neural network (GRNN), and extreme \nlearning machine (ELM) with Gaussian kernels.\
    \ The linear correlation (LC) has been used \nfor evaluating this framework. In\
    \ Sharma et al. (2021), a cost-effective framework for IEQ \nprediction is introduced,\
    \ where MLP and eXtream Gradient Boosting Regression (XGBR) \nare used for providing\
    \ real-time measurements of the concentration of pollutants, i.e. CO2 \nand particulate\
    \ matter 2.5 ( PM2.5 ) in a set of classrooms. Moving on, an LSTM without \nusing\
    \ the forget gate (LSTM-wF) is deployed to predict the air quality at a lower\
    \ complex-\nity and increase the prediction performance.\nIn Alawadi et al. (2020),\
    \ an indoor temperature forecasting scheme is proposed, where \nup to 36 ML models\
    \ (pertaining to 20 different families) have been deployed. Real-world \ndata\
    \ gathered for three hours from both smart households and weather station have\
    \ been \nused to validate this study. Similarly, in Aliberti et  al. (2019), Aliberti\
    \ et  al. propose a \nsmart solution for indoor air-temperature prediction, where\
    \ a non-linear autoregressive \nneural network (NN-ARNN) has been utilized to\
    \ perform short- and medium-term fore-\ncasting. This model has been then validated\
    \ on both a synthetic dataset and real-world data \nrecorded using IoT devices\
    \ installed in residential buildings.\nAs CO2 concentration is appropriate for\
    \ measuring the IEQ quality due to its over the \nsensor networks, a set of frameworks\
    \ have adopted it. For instance, in Taheri and Razban \n(2021), an ML-based IEQ\
    \ monitoring approach is proposed by predicting CO2 concentra-\ntion in the academic\
    \ building (campus classrooms) using demand-controlled ventilation. \nVarious\
    \ ML algorithms have been employed and compared to learn the CO2 concentration,\
    \ \namong them SVM, AdaBoost, RF, Gradient Boosting (GB), LR, and MLP. In a similar\
    \ \nway, Kallio et al. (2021) propose a smart approach to forecast office indoor\
    \ CO2 concentra-\ntion by adopting four ML algorithms, i.e. ridge regression (RR),\
    \ DT, RF, and MLP. Moreo-\nver, a baseline to evaluate the indoor CO2 prediction\
    \ has been introduced by producing \na benchmark dataset covering an entire year.\
    \ Moving on, In Tagliabue et al. (2021), an \nML-based IEQ monitoring approach\
    \ that relies on measuring the CO2 concentration in an \nacademic building is\
    \ proposed. Specifically, an LSTM-based RNN models and IoT sen-\nsors have been\
    \ then used for monitoring the indoor conditions depending on the occupancy \n\
    patterns.\nOther IEQ monitoring frameworks have focused on measuring and predicting\
    \ other \nfactors, which are recommended in various countries, such as total volatile\
    \ organic com-\npounds (TVOC), formaldehyde (HCHO), and carbon monoxide (CO).\
    \ For instance, in \nChen et al. (2018), Chen et al. use four ML models, including\
    \ SVM, Gaussian processes \n(GP), M5P and backpropagation neural network (BPNN)\
    \ for predicting CO2 , HCHO, and \nTVOC in an academic building (in Singapore).\
    \ In a similar way, in Lagesse et al. (2020), \nvarious ML models are utilized\
    \ for predicting PM2.5 in office buildings, i.e. ANN, LSTM, \nmultiple linear\
    \ regression (MLR), partial least squares regression (PLS), distributed lag \n\
    model (DLM), and least absolute shrinkage selector operator (LASSO).\nOther AI-big\
    \ data analytics have also been used to perform additional tasks. For exam-\n\
    ple, Loy et  al. (2020a) introduce a variational autoencoder (VAE) coupled with\
    \ convo-\nlutional layers (VAE-CNN) model to impute missing IEQ data. Accordingly,\
    \ two sce-\nnarios have been adopted to evaluate the VAE-CNN algorithms: (i) a\
    \ point-to-point data \nremoval, and (ii) data intervals removing at different\
    \ sampling rates. While in Kalajdjieski \net  al. (2020), the capability of generative\
    \ adversarial networks (GANs) is exploited in \n 4972\nY. Himeur et al.\n1 3\n\
    combination with a data augmentation technique for overcoming the class-imbalance\
    \ issue \nwhile monitoring IEQ using large-scale datasets. Table 6 outlines pertinent\
    \ AI-Big data \nanalytics frameworks introduced for monitoring IEQ and performs\
    \ a comparison between \nthem, with reference to the AI model, forecast horizon,\
    \ building environment, year of \nappearance, method description and evaluation\
    \ metrics.\n3.5.7  Security and safety\nAmong the major safety concerns in general\
    \ and in buildings, in particular, are the fire out-\nbreak. The prevention of\
    \ and the immediate reaction to fires minimizes their consequences \nin terms\
    \ of the people’s well-being and the financial losses. This includes the minimization\
    \ \nof fire incidents potentials, the fast detection and extinguishment of the\
    \ fire source, the \neffective execution of emergency evacuation, and the prompt\
    \ notification of the emergency \nsituation to the concerned authorities. Buildings\
    \ are usually equipped with conventional \nfire alarm and extinguishment systems\
    \ consisting of several sensing devices, including \nsmoke, heat, and flame detectors,\
    \ automated alarms, and water sprinklers (Zverovich et al. \n2016). With the advent\
    \ of big data algorithms and analytics, the fire safety in buildings can \nbe\
    \ boosted by employing buildings data to develop frameworks for fire prevention,\
    \ detec-\ntion, and suspension. An analysis of the advantage of utilizing ML algorithms\
    \ for reliable \nand prompt fire detection was provided in Surya (2017) represented\
    \ in their distinguished \ncapability of black-box modeling, feature extraction,\

    \ fire detection systems, ML-based models can be \nused to detect fire, analyze\
    \ it effects, assess its risks, predict its behavior utilizing the data \ncollected\
    \ from the sensing devices.\nFor example, in Zhang et al. (2021), a model combining\
    \ a deep belief network (DBN) \nand a recurrent LSTM neural network (R-LSTM-NN)\
    \ was proposed for fire hazards pre-\ndiction in smart cities. The proposed model\
    \ was used in predicting the air quality that is \nthen used to detect fire outbreaks\
    \ based on the sensors readings of the IoT system. It shows \npromising potential\
    \ in when data records of the IoT system are available for normal opera-\ntion\
    \ and scenarios of fire occurrence. In Fu (2020), a comparative study was presented\
    \ \nusing ML algorithms, namely, DT, KNN, and NNs, to develop classification models\
    \ to pre-\ndict failure patterns and to assess the progressive collapse potential\
    \ for steel framed build-\nings in fire. The study aimed to develop a reliable\
    \ fire assessment tool for practitioners and \nthe developed framework demonstrated\
    \ a satisfactory performance overly. In Sultan Mah-\nmud et al. (2017), another\
    \ comparative study was conducted for developing an intelligent \nfire detection\
    \ system with early notification system in which data mining algorithms such \n\
    as DTs, Bayesian networks (BayesNet), NNs, and SVM were used to develop data-driven\
    \ \nclassifiers using supervised learning. Moreover, the proposed smart fire detection\
    \ system \nemployed an edge detection model to analyze the data collected from\
    \ the cameras to con-\nfirm the fire detection decision. In Huda et al. (2012),\
    \ an AI-based framework was pro-\nposed to assess the thermal condition of electrical\
    \ installations in buildings to prevent the \npotential of injuries and fire hazards\
    \ using infrared images. Raw data was processed using \nPCA for features selection\
    \ that are then used to develop an NN-based classifier to deter-\nmine the condition\

    \ and financial losses. The proposed framework \ndemonstrated a remarkable ability\
    \ to predict fire impacts accurately, and it represented a \npromising solution\
    \ to define and regulate fire safety strategies.\nThe security of the automation\
    \ and management system in buildings has become more \nimperative due to the rapid\
    \ advancement in the technologies used and the IoT systems. \nThe industry predicts\
    \ that the IoT market will grow from an installed base of 30.7 Bil-\nlion devices\
    \ in 2020 to 75.4 Billion in 2025 (IoT Security Foundation), which will expose\
    \ \nthem to increased risk of advanced attack vectors. According to Kaspersky\
    \ Lab, nearly four \nin ten buildings were targeted by attacks in the first half\
    \ of 2019 , and it is expected that \nthe impact of cyberattacks on the building\
    \ and construction industry will be significant \nin the coming years (Kaspersky).\
    \ In Elnour et al. (2021), an attack detection framework \nfor false data injection\
    \ was proposed for a multi-zone HVAC system in office buildings \nutilizing an\
    \ isolation forest (IF) algorithm. The operational data of the system’s sensor\
    \ and \ncontrol command signals were used to develop the detection model using\
    \ semi-supervised \nlearning. Isolation forests are characterized by the low computational\
    \ requirement and \ncapability to handle to complex and multi-variate data. They\
    \ work based on pointing out \nanomalies using the concept of isolation, which\
    \ improves the attack detection capability. \nFeature selection was applied to\
    \ the raw data, and the study presented a comparative analy-\nsis of two models\
    \ for feature reduction, which are PCA based model and a 1D-CNN-based \nmodel.\n\
    In de Assis et al. (2020), a security system for industrial IoT was proposed in\
    \ which \na CNN-based classifier was developed to identify distributed denial\
    \ of service (DDoS) \nattacks in software-defined networks (SDNs). This system\
    \ is based on supervised learn-\ning from the labeled network data of the IoT\
    \ system. CNNs are advantageous for their \nhigh accuracy and classification performance,\
    \ and powerful capability in realizing com-\nplex interdependency from multi-variate\
    \ and sophisticated data. While in Aboelwafa et al. \n(2020), a residual-based\
    \ attack detection framework was presented in which an NN-based \nauto-encoder\
    \ was trained to profile normal system behavior. Then, non-conforming obser-\n\
    vations are identified as anomalies based on the generated residuals between the\
    \ input and \nthe output of the AE. Auto-encoders are used to learn the latent\
    \ feature representation \nof the system using healthy operational data. They\
    \ are also used for data dimensionality \nreduction, noise filtering, information\
    \ retrieval, etc. In Yahyaoui et al. (2020), a preliminary \ndemonstration of\
    \ a ML-based intrusion detection system for data protection in healthcare \ncenters\
    \ was presented. An SVM model was developed using the labeled data of the IoT\
    \ net-\nwork and it demonstrated a promising performance in detecting malicious\
    \ actions launched \nagainst the IoT system. The accuracy of the proposed framework\
    \ was assessed based on \nthe energy consumption in the communication network\

    \ The data can be directly used as inputs to con-\ntrol and regulate some of the\
    \ buildings’ equipment, such as lights, air conditioning, doors, \netc. Additionally,\
    \ scholars and researchers utilize big data analytics to develop approaches \n\
    for analyzing and processing building occupancy data to facilitate an efficient\
    \ and reliable \noverall building management (Sardianos et al. 2020).\nIn Huang\
    \ and Hao (2020), a DL-based visual recognition was used to implement an \noccupancy\
    \ detection framework utilizing CNNs. The proposed approach was used to deter-\n\
    mine the number of people present and their location to help operate demand-based\
    \ HVAC \nsystems more reliably and efficiently. It was found that the proposed\
    \ approach outperforms \nthe conventional occupancy detection systems in terms\
    \ of accuracy, precision, robustness, \nability to provide occupancy count, and\
    \ ability of static and dynamic occupancy detection. \nIt also requires hardware\
    \ and computational considerations as CNNs have a high computa-\ntional overhead.\
    \ In Acquaah et al. (2020), a study was presented to estimate the occupancy \n\
    count based on thermal images using CNNs for feature extraction and SVM for multi-class\
    \ \nclassification. Two well-known CNN architectures were investigated, which\
    \ are the 50 lay-\ners ResNet (ResNet-50) and AlexNet using transfer learning\
    \ due to their superior perfor-\nmance in image processing (He et al. 2016; Krizhevsky\
    \ et al. 2012). In Tien et al. (2021), a \ncomputer vision-based occupancy and\
    \ equipment usage detection framework was proposed \nto facilitate a demand driven\
    \ control of the HVAC system in an office room. A multi-class \nregion-based CNN\
    \ model was developed and deployed to analyze camera images. It can \npredict\
    \ the occupancy count, activity type (i.e. sitting, walking, etc.), and equipment\
    \ usage \nin real-time.\nA thermal-based occupancy detection approach was presented\
    \ in Zhao et al. (2018) \nin which data-driven models were developed using SVR\
    \ and RNN to predict occupancy \ninformation using the building’s properties,\
    \ including indoor temperature, towards man-\naging energy use and security monitoring\
    \ in intelligent buildings. That is, the interac-\ntion of the thermal components\
    \ present in the conditioned space and the necessary part \nof determining thermal\
    \ consistency is indicated by the indoor temperature. Supervised \nlearning was\
    \ used to train the ML models using simulation data generated from Energy \nPlus\
    \ such that the target outputs were the occupancy count. The work in Elkhoukhi\
    \ \net al. (2020) combined the IoT technology and Big data analytics to implement\
    \ real-\ntime occupancy detection such that data of the indoor lighting, temperature,\
    \ humidity, \nand CO2 levels were used to predict the status of the building occupancy.\
    \ Two models \nwere developed and tested, one using LDA and the other using vertical\
    \ hoeffding tree \n(VHT) for offline and online occupancy detection, respectively.\
    \ Additionally, in Fatema \nand Malik (2021), feature extraction and correlation\
    \ analysis were performed on indoor \nsensors data (i.e., temperature, CO2 level,\
    \ light intensity, humidity) and then particle \nswarm optimization was used to\
    \ train an NN-based occupancy detection model. It dem-\nonstrated improved classification\
    \ performance compared to conventional NNs optimized \nusing the back-propagation\
    \ algorithm.\nIn Wu and Wang, a ML-based model was proposed to improve the operation\
    \ of the \nBAMS due to the shortcomings of infrared sensors for stationary occupancy.\
    \ The model \npredicted the occupancy status based on multiple statistical features\
    \ of the signals acquired \nby the infrared sensors. ML algorithms were investigated,\
    \ among which SVM demon-\nstrated the best performance due to its ability to capture\
    \ complex and nonlinear functions, \nand its efficacy in handling high dimensional\
    \ data. In Huchuk et al. (2019), a comparative \nanalysis was presented for occupancy\
    \ forecasting using ML algorithms based on thermo-\nstat data. The prediction\
    \ model was intended to optimize the operation of the air condition-\ning system,\
    \ such that both the present and the future occupancy information is taken into\

    \ outperformed the LR, the Markov model, the \nhidden Markov model (HMM) and the\
    \ RNN, which is based on the bagging technique in \nwhich multiple models on different\
    \ subsets of the training dataset are developed, then their \npredictions are\
    \ combined to conclude the final output of the RF model. However, occu-\npancy\
    \ forecasting is only dependable when the building does not exhibit rapid and\
    \ random \nfluctuations in the user profile, which is generally the case for residential\
    \ buildings.\nIn Razavi et al. (2019), a comparative study was presented for the\
    \ utilization of super-\nvised ML algorithms such as SVM, RF, KNN, and NNs to\
    \ estimate and predict occupancy \ninformation in residential buildings based\
    \ on power meters data. It was found that the \nreliability of occupancy prediction\
    \ is lower for the larger forecast horizons. In Feng et al. \n(2020), a DL-based\
    \ approach is proposed combining a CNN and a bidirectional LSTM \nnetwork for\
    \ occupancy detection in houses based on electrical data of advanced metering\
    \ \ninfrastructures (AMIs). The data essentially contain readings of electric\
    \ current, voltage, \nand power that are processed by the CNN for spatial feature\
    \ extraction. Using supervised \nlearning, the extracted features are then fed\
    \ to the BiLSTM network to solve a binary classi-\nfication problem to identify\
    \ the occupancy condition in real-time. The proposed framework \ndemonstrated\
    \ improved performance when compared to other ML and DL based models \ndue to\
    \ its ability to interpret the spatial and contextual features of the data. However,\
    \ since \ndetailed occupancy information are mostly not recorded and hence not\
    \ available, super-\nvised learning-based approaches that are based on such a\
    \ detailing in the data (i.e., people \ncount) can be impractical and difficult\
    \ to implement using actual building data. While in \nPešić et al. (2019), a LSTM\
    \ network-based framework was proposed to perform occupancy \ndetection and forecasting\
    \ as well as data analytics based on Bluetooth positioning and WiFi \nutilization\
    \ data of the IoT infrastructure in a multi-story residential building. The network\
    \ \ndata were pre-processed to extract the information of the occupancy of the\
    \ apartments, \nthen used to develop the LSTM network to predict and forecast\
    \ occupancy condition and \npatterns in the different spaces of the building.\
    \ The proposed work demonstrated the effec-\ntive fusion of Bluetooth and WiFi\
    \ data as well as the successful deployment of NN-based \ndata analytics using\
    \ wireless networks data for occupancy detection application. Table 8 \nsummarizes\
    \ the relevant AI-Big data analytics frameworks developed to detect occupancy\
    \ \nprofiles.\n3.5.9  Water usage management\nAlmost all kinds of buildings are\
    \ users of water, although the cost of water and sewer ser-\nvices varies from\
    \ area to area and can become a significant expense. Worse, in areas where \n\
    there is a shortage of water, it is not only a big expense, but an imperative\
    \ to conserve. \nTherefore, it becomes of significant importance to bring the\
    \ monitoring of water levels \nand switching points of all wet applications in\
    \ buildings to the BAMS. Furthermore, water \nmonitoring systems can benefit from\
    \ the advancement of AI and ML technologies for \nimproving their performance\

    \ analytics, it is possible to maximize information and data available and \n\
    hence make better decisions while enhancing service delivery and reducing costs\
    \ (Rahim \net al. 2020).\nIn this context, using IoT water meters with wireless\
    \ connectivity (Bluetooth, \nLoRaWAN, etc), it becomes relatively easy to install\
    \ water meters within the building. \nThese can be as simple as pulse style meters\
    \ that can easily be integrated into a BAMS. \nMoving on, adopting AI-big data\

    \ and also capturing periodicity and converting nonstationary signals into stationary\

    \ water demand. The \nRMSE and Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency have been\
    \ adopted to evaluate the predic-\ntion performance of the learning model and\
    \ its ability to extend prediction lead time. Shine \net al. (2018), diverse ML\
    \ models are used for predicting water consumption in an agricultural \nbuilding\
    \ based on analyzing data collected from a remote monitoring system. Thus, RF,\
    \ ANN, \nSVM, and CART decision tree (CDT) algorithms were trained to predict\
    \ water consumption, \nwhere a backward sequential variable selection was adopted\
    \ for excluding variables adding \nlow predictive power along with a hyper-parameter\
    \ tuning with nested cross-validation for cal-\nculating the prediction accuracy\
    \ for each model. In a similar way, in Smolak et al. (2020), \nthree ML algorithms\
    \ are implemented and compared for predicting water usage, i.e. RF, SVM, \nARIMA.\
    \ The water consumption data augmented with end-users occupancy patterns were\
    \ \nused to improve the prediction accuracy. A novel approach to process and correlate\
    \ between \noccupancy and water usage time-series was introduced. This framework\
    \ was validated on 51 \ndays of water consumption readings and over 7 million\
    \ occupancy patterns from urban areas.\nOn the other hand, by using AI-big data\
    \ analytics, it is also possible to monitor water quality \nand hence improve\
    \ water resources management plans. In Chen et al. (2020), 10 ML models \nare\
    \ deployed to water quality prediction (WQP). Specifically, DT, NB, LR, LDA, completely-\n\
    random tree (CRT), KNN, SVM, RF, and deep cascade forest (DCRF) have been trained\
    \ using \nwater data from a hydro-electric power (HEP) plant, including pH, DO,\
    \ CODMn, and NH3-N \nto forecast water quality. The precision, recall, F1 score,\
    \ and weighed F1-score (wF1) have \nbeen selected to evaluate the prediction performance\
    \ of the ML algorithms. In Roccetti et al. \nFig. 5  Flowchart of water usage\
    \ monitoring system used to detect water leaks and optimize water consump-\ntion\
    \ (Jenny et al. 2020)\n 4984\nY. Himeur et al.\n1 3\n(2019), Roccetti et al. develop\
    \ an ML-based classifier, which is personalized for predicting the \nfailure of\
    \ a water meter. Typically, an RNN model is deployed for (i) processing 15 million\
    \ \nof readings collected from 1 million of mechanical water meters, and (ii)\
    \ extracting relevant \npatterns representing the complex phenomenon of defective\
    \ water meters. This has helped in \nachieving more than 80% accuracy in detecting\
    \ failures.\nIn Wang et al. (2018), water demand of urban areas is predicted using\
    \ gravitational search \nalgorithm (GSA) and backtracking search algorithm (BSA)\
    \ with ANN with regard to various \nweather parameters. While in Antunes et al.\
    \ (2018), four ML models are selected to predict \nwater demand, including ANN,\
    \ RF, SVM and KNN, through the analysis of real-world data \nfrom two Portuguese\
    \ water utilities. Moving forward, a weighted parallel strategy for com-\nbining\
    \ multiple ML algorithms is introduced to improve the prediction performance.\
    \ Moreo-\nver, additional data related to weather, seasonality, and feature extraction\
    \ (forecast window \nof time-series data) are also analyzed. In Nasser et al.\
    \ (2020), the water demand prediction is \nperformed using an LSTM model based\
    \ on analyzing data gathered from intelligent IoT water \nmeters. A cloud platform\
    \ has been used to store water consumption records, enabling near \nreal-time\
    \ data streaming and storing. The performance of LSTM has been then compared to\
    \ \nthose of SVR and RF. Similarly, in Du et al. (2021), Du et al. propose an\
    \ LSTM model that \ncombines discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and PCA to forecast\
    \ daily urban water demand. \nTherefore, after smoothing the outliers of water\
    \ demand time-series, noise components are \nremoved using DWT and pCA. Following,\
    \ the LSTM network is deployed to predict urban \nwater demand using the outputs\
    \ of DWT and PCA. Table 9 presents the main AI-Big data \nanalytics frameworks\
    \ proposed for water management in buildings.\n3.6  Evaluation metrics\nEvaluation\
    \ metrics are used to measure the performance of the model in terms of the \n\
    quality of its output as per what is expected. For AI applications, there are\
    \ various \ntypes of metrics that can be used based on the subject matter. That\
    \ is, the outputs of \nan AI model can take two forms, which are categorical variables\
    \ (Cvars) and quantita-\ntive variables (Qvars). For instance, the outputs of\
    \ classification models represent cat-\negorical variables in which the input\
    \ data are classified into different groups or classes \nwhich are characterized\
    \ by a unique label or value such as detection problems, rec-\nommender systems,\
    \ etc. Each observation can be placed in a single category, and the \ncategories\
    \ are mutually exclusive. Hence, the performance of the model depends on its \n\
    ability to correctly classify the observations to their respective categories/groups.\n\
    On the other hand, quantitative variables represent numerical values that exhibit\
    \ \nquantitative characteristics. Regression models have quantitative variables\
    \ as outputs \nsuch as forecasting and estimation models in which the AI model\
    \ is used to represent \nthe mapping between the independent variable(s)—i.e.,\
    \ the input(s)—and the depend-\nent variable(s)—i.e., the output(s)—. In this\
    \ case, the quality of the model is measured \nby the closeness of the model’s\
    \ outputs to the ideal expected values. Table 10 presents \na summary of the common\
    \ metrics used to evaluate AI models.\n4985\nAI‑big data analytics for building\

    \ discussion and current challenges\nA truly smart building combines a BAMS with\
    \ intelligent data analytics software that \noffers helpful insights for maintenance,\
    \ service, and efficiency opportunities. Typically, \nthese tools together offer\
    \ benefits for building owners, such as: (i) providing a high-\nlevel, system-wide\
    \ big data capture of the entire operations, (ii) ensuring air quality \ncontrol\
    \ and a healthier building environment, (iii) saving energy and energy consump-\n\
    tion during off-peak or low occupancy periods, (iv) eliminating waste from everyday\
    \ \nsystem usage through intelligent sensor data, (v) offering guidance for performance\
    \ \nimprovements for individual assets, (vi) addressing equipment that really\
    \ needs repair \nand not just those on a fixed schedule that don’t need to be\
    \ serviced, and (vii) offering \nadvanced automation capabilities and actionable\
    \ results. In addition to these benefits, \nthe cost savings related to the use\
    \ of smart data analytics can be significant.\nHowever, various gaps specific\
    \ to each application field of AI-big data analytics \nare identified. Among them,\
    \ more effort should be put to efficiently carrying out text \nanalytics on operators’\
    \ work-order logs; and identifying (i) the information to derive, \n(ii) the text-mining\
    \ methods to adopt, and (iii) the efficient approaches to convey the \ninformation\
    \ to the operator and visualize it. Moreover, another challenging issue con-\n\
    cerns the use of virtual metering, where a limited number of works were dedicated\
    \ to \nvirtual meter development (Kim et al. 2021; Wilcox 2020) despite its significance\
    \ in \nhelping operators for understanding plant-to-zone water and energy flows\
    \ and ranking \ntheir operational decisions, such as identifying and evaluating\
    \ faults.\nThe HVAC prognostic and failure prediction is another application that\
    \ is still very \nchallenging, where limited research activity was conducted to\
    \ target this challenge. In \nfact, developing prognostics models is valuable\
    \ for (i) predicting the time-to-failure, \n(ii) avoiding global failures in key\
    \ BAMS components (e.g. boilers, chillers, pumps, \nfans, etc.), and preventing\
    \ disruptions in building services. In addition, there are new \nchallenges from\
    \ emerging BAMSs that need to be addressed, e.g. data benchmarking, \nbig data\
    \ security and privacy, scalability and interoperability, real-time big data intel-\n\
    ligence and knowledge transfer.\n4.1  Data quality issues\nUsually, raw data gathered\
    \ from BAMSs can have some data quality problems, including \n(i) outliers, (ii)\
    \ noise, (iii) inconsistent data, (iv) duplicate data, and (v) missing values.\
    \ \nData pre-processing techniques are deployed to overcome these issues, such\
    \ as formatting, \ncleaning, and resampling. Formatting aims at converting the\
    \ raw data into appropriate for-\nmats to ease the application of ML algorithms,\
    \ while cleaning refers to removing or replac-\ning missing samples (Zhang et al.\
    \ 2021). Lastly, resampling can be applied based on the \nrequirements of ML algorithms.\
    \ Typically, it can be (i) a down-sampling to reduce data \nredundancy, foster\
    \ the processing and improve the accuracy; or (ii) an up-sampling that \nhelps\
    \ increase the amounts of data to train data-hungry ML models, especially DL algo-\n\
    rithms (Elnour et al. 2022). To that end, because of the high requirements for\
    \ data quality \nset by ML models, developing novel strategies to improve the\
    \ quality of BAMS recorded \ndata by creating additional data with enhanced quality\
    \ or augmenting existing datasets is a \ncrucial challenge.\n 4988\nY. Himeur\

    4.2  Data scarcity and data benchmarking\nThe different applications of BAMSs\
    \ necessitate extensive historical data to train the \nAI-big data analytics,\
    \ especially those based on DL algorithms before they can be used \nreliably.\
    \ However, large-scale data might not be available for some reason or can not\
    \ be \nrecorded representatively and sufficiently in a short time when we study\
    \ newly-built envi-\nronments. Fortunately, the problems addressed within each\
    \ specific AI-big data analyt-\nics task in BAMSs illustrate some similarities.\
    \ This could be justified by the fact that the \ndifferent application tasks,\
    \ despite studying distinct problems, use the same data-driven \nalgorithms which\
    \ are validated on slightly similar datasets collected from different kinds \n\
    of buildings and devices. This has opened opportunities for using knowledge transfer\
    \ and \ntransfer learning to overcome the lack of datasets in some situations,\
    \ e.g. sports facilities.\nOn the other hand, collecting and benchmarking data\
    \ represents the most significant \nchallenge so far when applying AI-big data\
    \ analytics in BAMSs, especially for the case of \nlarge buildings, i.e. sports\
    \ facilities, commercial centers, industrial buildings. Many tasks \nrequire annotated\
    \ datasets to train AI models and validate them. Indeed, developing and \nvalidating\
    \ new data-driven algorithms require recording and annotating large-scale data-\n\
    sets, especially when using DL algorithms that are notoriously data-hungry (Kučera\
    \ and \nPitner 2018). Improving the performance of BAMSs does not rely only on\
    \ the selection of \nAI algorithms but also on the quality and parameters of datasets\
    \ used to train them.\nFor instance, labeled and accurate anomaly detection datasets\
    \ are needed for develop-\ning new automatic anomaly detection solutions. Similarly,\
    \ development and validation of \noccupancy detection algorithms require repositories\
    \ of building occupancy profiles with \nconcurrent ground-truth people counts.\
    \ In this context, to further improve the performance \nof BAMSs, public and open-access\
    \ datasets are needed for different application fields (e.g., \nload forecasting,\
    \ anomaly and fault detection, demand response, occupant-centric controls, \n\
    IEQ monitoring, water monitoring, etc.) for assessing the AI-big data analytics\
    \ algorithms \ndeveloped by the AI Community (Park et al. 2019; Francisco et al.\
    \ 2020).\nFrom another hand, successful sustainability strategies to overcome\
    \ this issue could be \nvia (i) incentivizing buildings/facilities managers for\
    \ participating in benchmarking cam-\npaigns and surveys organized for different\
    \ application fields, and (ii) encouraging the AI \ncommunity in organizing data\
    \ benchmarking competitions and challenges.\n4.3  Security and privacy preservation\n\
    The nature of data collected in BAMSs introduces new challenges in data analytics,\
    \ i.e. \nsecurity and privacy preservation, in which traditional technologies\
    \ can not deal with. \nUsing encapsulated protocols and IP-based communication,\
    \ BAMSs are more and more \nconnected to corporate networks and also remotely\
    \ accessed for management reasons, both \nfor emergency and convenience purposes.\
    \ However, security and privacy preservation have \nnot been set as a primary\
    \ concern when designing these protocols. Therefore, most of the \nBAMSs are being\
    \ operated with sub-standard or non-existent security implementations, \nand mainly\
    \ rely on ensuring security by obscurity. In this line, there has been recently\
    \ a \nmove to address the shortfalls of security and privacy preserving implementations\
    \ in \nBAMSs (Stamatescu et al. 2020; Ashaj and Erçelebi 2020). However, the definition\
    \ of the \nnew threats against BAMSs, and identification of these threats is still\
    \ a field that is excep-\ntionally lacking.\n 4992\nY. Himeur et al.\n1 3\nMoreover,\
    \ another critical concern about security in BAMSs is related to the fact that\
    \ \nbuildings’ data is valuable not only for managers and other BAMS competitors,\
    \ as it is \nattached to the control of buildings’ equipment. Typically, it could\
    \ be significantly criti-\ncal to end-users if manipulated. To that end, sharing\
    \ data in most BAMSs has limited the \nbuildings’ intranet. Also, any attempts\
    \ to extract this data to cloud data centers can result in \nsevere security risks,\
    \ considerably higher costs for the appropriate security systems or both \n(Lv\
    \ et al. 2021; Himeur et al. 2022).\n4.4  Scalability and interoperability\nAn\
    \ important issue of BAMSs is the inherent lack of scalability and interoperability.\
    \ This \nis because each BAMS manufacturer has its own proprietary data protocol\
    \ that requires \nthe development and maintenance of various processes and integrations.\
    \ Moreover, BAMS \nvendors usually have competing products and thus are incentivized\
    \ to make their data inac-\ncessible to third parties (Png et al. 2019; Tang et al.\
    \ 2020). Therefore, the interoperabil-\nity is a legitimate concern for making\
    \ efficient smart buildings as it refers to the ability \nof all the systems inside\
    \ a building to communicate with one another. Specifically, with \nthe actual\
    \ proliferation of intelligent building technologies designed and manufactured\
    \ by \na plethora of companies, there is a need to make them communicate universally\
    \ for pro-\nmoting their deployment inside residential, commercial, industrial,\
    \ and office buildings \n(Ozturk 2020; Miori et al. 2019). Put differently, as\
    \ smart buildings need to meet energy \nand water efficiency, adequate indoor\
    \ environmental conditions, high comfort levels, and \neconomic goals set by building\
    \ managers/users, they require the use of a highly-connected \nbuilding automation\
    \ system in which different parts can efficiently communicate with one \nanother\
    \ and adjust to changes in the environment. However, while numerous buildings\
    \ are \nequipped with excellent systems, they often lack a combined monitoring\
    \ system for light-\ning, climate control, water monitoring and blinds that could\
    \ facilitate efficiency measures \n(Schachinger et al. 2017).\nThe BAMS community\
    \ makes great efforts to develop and deploy communication pro-\ntocols that ensure\
    \ interoperability, such as Modbus, KNX, LonWorks, and Protocol 3964R \n(Merz\
    \ et al. 2018). For instance, LonWorks and KNX are interoperable open standards\
    \ as \nthey can be used together. However, integration concerns may arise (Tang\
    \ et al. 2020). The \ntechnologies’ popularity can hinder interoperability potential\
    \ in BAMSs, as the example \nwith LonWorks, the market leader in the United States.\
    \ In contrast, KNX—widely used in \nEurope—has yet to impact (Merz et al. 2018).\
    \ Additionally, the installation and operation \ncosts can pose severe integration\
    \ limitations. Indeed, many contractors or system integra-\ntors that provide\
    \ off-the-shelf solutions are less concerned about whether the integration is\
    \ \nsuccessful.\n4.5  Real‑time big data intelligence\nCollecting and analyzing\
    \ data in real-time are of significant importance while designing \npowerful and\
    \ efficient BAMSs. The first step towards this is by adopting a real-time sub-\n\
    metering, which helps in tracking track utility costs by building region (floor,\
    \ room, etc), \nby the tenants, by individual facility equipment (e.g., HVAC,\
    \ lighting), etc. Therefore, \ngranular utility sub-metering data provides the\
    \ essential tools for monitoring energy costs/\nperformance, water consumption/waste.\
    \ This will result in accurately identifying usage \n4993\nAI‑big data analytics\
    \ for building automation and management…\n1 3\nanomalies, enabling data-driven\
    \ portfolio analysis, etc. Although the value of real-time \nsub-metering is unquestioned,\
    \ most of the BAMSs are still unable to provide the real-time \ndata monitoring,\
    \ which delays decision-making measures and hence reduces then the qual-\nity\
    \ of efficiency and optimization operations.\n5  Case studies\nThis literature\
    \ review established several applications of AI big data analytics for build-\n\
    ings in terms of energy management, load forecasting, water management, FDAD,\
    \ or IEQ \nmonitoring. In this section, we present their deployment for energy-related\
    \ applications \ngiven the continuous rise in energy consumption worldwide of\
    \ the buildings sector under \nthe global energy dilemma and the energy optimization\
    \ potential of BAMSs, given the \nincreasing concerns about energy efficiency\
    \ in buildings. More specifically, the case stud-\nies handle two of the lead\
    \ causes of energy waste in buildings, which are (i) system faults \nand equipment\
    \ malfunctioning, and (ii) poor management and regulation of the buildings’ \n\
    systems (Alsalemi et al. 2022; Elnour et al. 2022, 2020). The first two case studies\
    \ pre-\nsent strategies for energy anomaly detection that can be due to both or\
    \ either of the for-\nmer causes. They demonstrate the deployment of two different\
    \ methods: unsupervised and \nsupervised learning. The last case study presents\
    \ the use of AI data analytics to establish \nreliable and efficient regulation\
    \ of HVAC systems, given that those are considered major \nenergy consumers in\
    \ buildings (energy.gov, Elnour et al. 2022; Fadli et al. 2021).\n5.1  Unsupervised\
    \ AI‑based energy anomaly detection\nThis section presents an example of using\
    \ unsupervised ML algorithms for detecting \nabnormal energy consumption (Himeur\
    \ et al. 2022). Therefore, four algorithms are con-\nsidered, namely (i) OCSVM\
    \ with linear kernel, (ii) OCSVM with Gaussian kernel, (iii) \nDBSCAN, and (iv)\
    \ LOF. They have been applied on the Dutch residential energy data-\nset (DRED),\
    \ which incorporates electricity consumption, occupancy patterns and ambient \n\
    conditions of a typical household (in the Netherlands). Figure 6 portrays the\
    \ scatter plot \nof energy footprints in which normal and abnormal patterns are\
    \ identified using the afore-\nmentioned approaches. It has been clearly seen\
    \ OCSVM (with linear kernel) detects more \nenergy samples that fall outside the\
    \ inlier region, which refer to consumption anomalies. \nWhile by using OCSVM\
    \ (with a Gaussian kernel), the number of samples that fall inside \nthe inlier\
    \ region has been reduced because of its separation capability introduced by the\
    \ \nhyperplane generated using the Gaussian kernel. From another side, LOF and\
    \ DBSCAN \nhelp detect abnormal patterns with almost the same efficiency as OCSMV\
    \ (with the Gauss-\nian kernel), and only a slight difference has been registered\
    \ in classifying a few numbers of \nsamples.\n5.2  Supervised AI‑based energy\
    \ anomaly detection\nSupervised ML algorithms excelled in detecting abnormal energy\
    \ usage, although they \nrequire labeled energy data. To that end, in Himeur et \
    \ al. (2021), a micro-moment-\nbased approach is introduced to cluster energy\
    \ footprints of an office building (at Qatar \nUniversity) into five classes with\
    \ reference to the energy consumption, occupancy pat-\nterns and appliance operation\
    \ specifications. These classes are named ”class 0: good \n 4994\nY. Himeur et\
    \ al.\n1 3\nusage”, ”class 1: turn on appliance”, ”class 2: turn off appliance”,\
    \ ”class 3: exces-\nsive consumption” and ”class 4: consumption while outside”.\
    \ Following, an improved \nKNN model is developed and used to learn abnormal energy\
    \ usage using this anno-\ntated data. Fig.  7 illustrates the flowchart of the\
    \ micro-moment based scheme used \nto extract and learn intent-driven moments\
    \ of energy consumption. Typically, energy \nmicro-moment features MF are extracted\
    \ based on analyzing occupancy profiles (O) \nand power consumption (p) of each\
    \ device in reference to device active consumption \nrange (DACR ), device operation\
    \ time (DOT) and device standby power consumption \n(DSPC). Then, the appliance\
    \ operation parameters are called, including DACR , DOT \nand DSPC. Table 11 presents\
    \ an example of different appliance parameter specifica-\ntions that are used\
    \ in the rule-based algorithm to extract power consumption micro-\nmoments (Himeur\
    \ et al. 2022).\nTo have a clear view of how abnormal energy consumption is distributed\
    \ over \nthe time, the scatter plot of energy consumption profiles of a television\
    \ is illustrated \nin Fig.  8. Accordingly, the corresponding normal and abnormal\
    \ energy patterns are \ndetected using an IKNN model and micro-moment analysis.\
    \ Because this approach \nuses a supervised learning with regard to occupancy\
    \ data, it has the capability of \nFig. 6  Energy consumption anomaly detection\
    \ in residential buildings using a) OCSVM with linear kernel, \nb) OCSVM with\
    \ Gaussian kernel, c) DBSCAN and d) LOF\n4995\nAI‑big data analytics for building\
    \ automation and management…\n1 3\nidentifying new consumption anomalies that\
    \ correspond to the absence of the end-\nusers when the television is on (this\
    \ abnormality can be extended to other devices that \nrequire the presence of\
    \ the user during their operation, e.g. the air conditioner, heater, \nfan, etc.).\
    \ Detecting such abnormalities was not doable if an unsupervised ML model \nwas\
    \ deployed, in which only energy patterns were analyzed.\n5.3  Energy and performance\
    \ optimization for sports facilities\nIn light of the increased global energy\
    \ demand and its associated environmental impacts, \nthe management and optimization\
    \ of sports facilities are becoming imperative as they are \ncharacterized by\
    \ high energy demand and occupancy profiles. This case study demonstrates \nthe\
    \ application of the model predictive control (MPC) theory and NNs for energy\
    \ and per-\nformance management of sports facilities. Figure 9 presents the proposed\
    \ NN-based MPC \nframework. The work is carried out using the building information\
    \ model of a sports hall \nin the sports complex of Qatar University using EnergyPlus\
    \ and practical data for model \ncalibration. MPC systems are robust as they allow\
    \ integrated dynamic optimization that \naccounts for the future system behavior\
    \ in the decision-making process. NNs are advanta-\ngeous for their ability to\
    \ represent complex functions with high accuracy.\nFig. 7  Block diagram of the\

    \ of \nthe building operation over time given its states x(k) (i.e., power usage,\

    \ evaluate the possible scenario \nin terms of the HVAC system settings, and occupancy\
    \ and operation schedules towards \nachieving a reasonable trade-off between those\
    \ three aspects prior to applying them in the \nfacility.\n6  Future directions\n\
    6.1  Multimodal data analysis\nDue to the advancement of today’s sensing and mobile\
    \ technologies, various modalities \nof data can be easily and effectively gathered\
    \ using different and advanced means. Thus, \nit is now possible to record and\
    \ process big data about environmental satisfaction lev-\nels of buildings’ occupants\
    \ in real-time and non-invasive manners (Plageras et al. 2018). \nBuildings’ end-users\
    \ naturally react to ambient environmental conditions for minimizing \nany environmental\
    \ stress, increasing their comfort based on their autonomic nervous sys-\ntems\
    \ and expressed by different poses, which can effectively influence different\
    \ building \noperation parameters (Amato et al. 2018). Therefore, it becomes of\
    \ utmost importance to \ndevelop tools for enhancing the interdisciplinary knowledge\
    \ (i.e. AI, IoT, big data, DL, \ncomputer vision) when managing building operations.\
    \ This helps significantly advance \nbuilding indoor environmental control and\
    \ sensing technologies as a function of human \nbio-signals (i.e. physiological\
    \ signals) and poses.\nAnalyzing multi-modal data helps BAMSs in boosting workplace\
    \ productivity and opti-\nmising office spaces, which in turn cutting costs and\
    \ increasing revenues for companies. \nMoreover, data generated from these systems\
    \ could be used to reduce the spread of viruses \nand other diseases inside buildings,\
    \ increasingly important since the outbreak of Covid-19 \n(Sun and Zhai 2020).\
    \ For instance, in Ding et al. (2020), investigate the collective con-\ntagion\
    \ of the COVID-19 virus inside indoor environments (i.e. healthcare facilities\
    \ and \npublic vehicles) along with the engineering control against virus spread\
    \ with ventilation \nsystems.\n6.2  In‑situ sensor calibration in BAMSs\nSensors\
    \ are key players in helping BAMSs to attain expected efficiency and automation.\
    \ \nHowever, they are affected by continuous failures and degradation over time.\
    \ To that \nend, in-situ sensor calibration plays a crucial role in calibrating\
    \ different BAMS work-\ning sensors (i.e., physical sensors) and avoiding significant\
    \ errors for reliable results \nwhen it is deployed to large-scale building sensor\
    \ networks (Yu and Li 2015). Most \nof the studies opted for the conventional\
    \ periodical calibration as a solution to over-\ncome sensor degradation and failure;\
    \ however, this is impractical and difficult for vari-\nous sensors. By contrast,\
    \ virtual in-situ calibration (VIC) can be a good alternative since \n5001\nAI‑big\
    \ data analytics for building automation and management…\n1 3\nit relies on mathematically\
    \ extracting the characteristics of essential aspects involved \nin a calibration,\
    \ such as the uncertainty quantification, benchmark establishment, and \nenvironment\
    \ assessment (Yoon and Yu 2018). Moreover, because BAMSs need digitally \nenhanced\
    \ data-rich environments, virtual sensors offer reliable and informative sens-\n\
    ing contexts for operational datasets in BAMSs. More specifically, in-situ virtual\
    \ sen-\nsors help develop the counterparts of target physical sensors in the field.\
    \ Therefore, they \ncan provide extra data related to residuals between physical\
    \ and virtual sensors for for \ndeployment in data-driven modeling, diagnostics\
    \ and analytics (Koo et al. 2022).\n6.3  Smart building digital twins\nThe increasing\
    \ amounts of data generated by BMAMs, and the need for new methods \nto leverage\
    \ it, have motivated scientists to investigate new strategies. One promising \n\
    solution is using the digital twins (DT) paradigm, which assumes a complete cohesion\
    \ \nand integration between the visual and physical worlds. Typically, DT can\
    \ deliver con-\nsiderable benefits to the BAMSs and the built environment in general\
    \ by helping bring \ntogether static and dynamic data from various sources (in\
    \ 2D/3D models) and assisting \nin making effective and informed decisions. Moreover,\
    \ it combines the knowledge from \nthe physical and digital worlds by collecting\
    \ real-time data from the physical environ-\nments and provides a real-time understanding\
    \ of buildings’ performance (Delgado and \nOyedele 2021). Besides, despite the\
    \ gradual exploration of digital twinning within the \nfields of building information\
    \ modeling (BIM) and cyber-physical systems (CPS), avail-\nable tools and techniques\
    \ need to be considered in the next level of integration (technol-\nogies and\
    \ procedures). This is to (i) provide DTs with more adaptability and more cohe-\n\
    sion over the managed information and (ii) extract more value from our virtual\
    \ models \n(Shahzad et al. 2022).\n6.4  Transfer learning\nSpecifically, transfer\
    \ learning has recently been proposed as solution that can be investi-\ngated\
    \ for the case of buildings with poor information data (Himeur et al. 2022). Put\
    \ sim-\nply, data and knowledge of already existing buildings (or old buildings)\
    \ with rich energy \nusage records, water management data, occupancy patterns,\
    \ IEQ monitoring footprints \nand and ambient environmental conditions can be\
    \ used. Therefore, various frameworks \nhave been introduced for target energy\
    \ forecasting (Gao et  al. 2020; Li et  al. 2021), \nanomaly detection of energy\
    \ consumption (Liang et al. 2018; Xu et al. 2021), fault diag-\nnosis of energy\
    \ systems (Liu et al. 2021; Zhu et al. 2021), HVAC fault detection (Dowl-\ning\
    \ et al. 2020), IEQ monitoring (Tariq et al. 2021), indoor occupancy detection\
    \ (Khalil \net al. 2021), etc.\n6.5  Blockchain\nDue to the security and privacy\
    \ issues that are still open in BAMSs, blockchain is consid-\nered as a promising\
    \ solution that provides the digital trust. It can function as a permanent, \n\
    \ 5002\nY. Himeur et al.\n1 3\ncloud-based and digital ledger of activities between\
    \ different users and partners (Nawari \nand Ravindran 2019; Liu et al. 2021).\
    \ Also, blockchain can operate as a distributed, single \nsource of shared truth\
    \ and has the possibility of becoming the top-system for recording \nall transactions.\
    \ Therefore, its deployment in BAMSs aims at (i) tracking and validating \nchanges\
    \ (e.g. security and surveillance, access control, etc.), (ii) monitoring HVAC\
    \ activi-\nties, (iii) recording property transfers, and (iv) detecting occupancy\
    \ patterns (Siountri et al. \n2020). Additionally, it can help manage intelligent\
    \ buildings and IoT devices with renew-\nable energy, e.g. wind and solar. For\
    \ example, suppose a facility is in a two-way energy \ncommunication with the\
    \ grid. In that case, blockchain can make it more secure and easier \nto develop\
    \ a digital record of energy-in and energy-out transactions (Tiwari and Batra).\
    \ On \nanother side, as the global market of building automation exceeds $120\
    \ billion, smart con-\ntracts can be utilized for automating warranties and providing\
    \ refunds when IoT-connected \ndevices or equipment do not perform as expected\
    \ (Himeur et al. 2022).\nOverall, there are numerous potential applications of\
    \ blockchain in BAMSs, although \nthe principal advantages are data is easy to\
    \ access, is secure, and can not be corrupted. \nSpecifically, data stored in\
    \ the blockchain database can be easily and quickly reviewed, \neven though it\
    \ is managed by distinct entities, which results in an accurate and fast data\
    \ \nanalysis (Nawari and Ravindran 2019). Moving forward, blockchain helps in\
    \ stream-\nlining processes and lowering costs through reducing and/or eliminating\
    \ those dreaded \nmanual operations, especially in public buildings, sports facilities,\
    \ and commercial \ncenters. This could be adapted to almost any process, including\
    \ preventive maintenance, \nwork orders, environmental health, and safety planning,\
    \ and space management (Nawari \nand Ravindran 2019).\nOnly for energy management\
    \ in smart buildings, blockchain has found diverse applica-\ntions. For instance,\
    \ in Van Cutsem et al. (2020), use a blockchain-based approach to coop-\nerate\
    \ energy management of multiple end-users in smart-buildings, where smart-contracts\
    \ \nhave been utilized to allow decentralizing community energy management. In\
    \ Mukherjee \net  al. (2021), a smart energy management solution is safeguarded\
    \ with blockchain and \nhence ensures judicious generation, uniform distribution\
    \ and shielded monitoring along \nwith guaranteed security and privacy of the\
    \ havoc data. In Tiwari and Batra, blockchain is \nintroduced for enabling the\
    \ reparation of smart buildings-cyber physical systems. Moving \non, decentralized\
    \ and flexible access control using smart contracts is developed for smart \n\
    and large commercial buildings in Bindra et al. (2021). This solution has been\
    \ proposed \nas an alternative to inefficient, unsystematic, and human-intensive\
    \ access control schemes \nusually used in these buildings. While the widespread\
    \ implementation of blockchain is \nstill a long way off, it is also challenging\
    \ to deploy this technology reliably and widely in \nBAMSs. This research area\
    \ needs to be further investigated in the near future. This prom-\nising new technology\
    \ could benefit the other tasks of smart buildings, i.e. water manage-\nment,\
    \ IEQ monitoring, occupancy detection, etc.\n6.6  Cyber‑security standards for BAMSs\n\
    While using AI in BAMSs represents a powerful asset, it also presents some data\
    \ secu-\nrity and privacy concerns and problems with the regulations. Typically,\
    \ AI-driven \nBAMSs involve the deployment of lower-cost sensors (both wired and\
    \ wireless) and the \nadoption of cloud, fog, edge, and/or hybrid computing architectures,\
    \ increasing cyber \nrisks. To that end, the need for a sound cybersecurity strategy\
    \ has become crucial for \npromoting secure remote BAMSs. Data flows must be planned\
    \ and monitored, possibly \n5003\nAI‑big data analytics for building automation\
    \ and management…\n1 3\nmaking it necessary to use one-way data diodes. On the\
    \ other hand, BAMSs integrate \nheterogeneous sensing, computation, and control\
    \ capabilities. They combine cyberspace \nwith the physical world to develop cyber-physical\
    \ systems. However, the security of \nBAMSs is significantly threatened by software/hardware\
    \ failures and/or cyber/physical \nattacks. For example, sensor failures can engender\
    \ false detection of abnormal energy/\nwater consumption behaviors and result\
    \ in actuator misbehavior.\nTo handle the above issues, privacy and security protection\
    \ mechanisms should be \nenforced. This is possible by providing recommendations\
    \ to the building automation \ncommunity, e.g., the data protection directive\
    \ 95/46/EC (Tokarski) suggests recommen-\ndations for supporting the security\
    \ of the implementation of smart metering and smart \nusing data controllers.\
    \ Addressing these recommendations can enable moving to fully \nharmonized data\
    \ protection environments and improving security measures in BAMSs. \nMoreover,\
    \ different cyber security standards can be used to secure BAMSs by address-\n\
    ing the cybersecurity for operational technology in automation and control systems,\
    \ \nsuch as ISA/IEC 62443 series (Bicaku et al.) and ASHRAE 135 series (BACnet)\
    \ (Tang \net al. 2020).\n6.7  Self‑learning for long‑term building operation\n\
    Self-learning ML models are key to realizing the BAMS in the long-term building\
    \ \noperation. The systems built upon these models have recently gained industry\
    \ recogni-\ntion and market share as they are based on using a ”user-friendly”\
    \ technology (Cortiços \n2019). Typically, self-learning, also called self-supervision,\
    \ is an emerging technology \nthat helps develop computationally efficient, low-cost,\
    \ autonomous, and self-supervised \nML algorithms (Kaklauskas et al. 2019). For\
    \ example, for energy management, a self-\nlearning control scheme assists in\
    \ assessing the energy flexibility of buildings, in addi-\ntion to guaranteeing\
    \ robustness, scalability, and adaptability. Moreover, automated \nself-learning\
    \ systems have promising perspectives when they are to integrate demand-\nresponse\
    \ strategies for effective home-energy management systems (Bampoulas et al. \n\
    2019).\n6.8  Edge analytics for BAMSs\nWith the advancement of BAMSs and the latest\
    \ generation of IoT devices, data acquisi-\ntion from multiple types of equipment\
    \ has become much easier in today’s buildings. \nReal-time access to this data\
    \ helps in better managing facility operations, sustaining \nefficiency, and lowering\
    \ costs. However, as most BAMSs are only implemented using \ncloud computing,\
    \ real-time data analysis may not be guaranteed. To overcome this issue, \nopen\
    \ software platforms hosted on edge nodes in close proximity to the building’s\
    \ IoT \ndevices can enable access to the building data and advanced analytics\
    \ deployed on these \nplatforms in real-time. In this context, edge computing\
    \ employs the processing power \nof IoT devices for filtering, pre-processing,\
    \ aggregating and storing recorded data, and \nactions can then be performed in\
    \ real-time using adequate analytical algorithms. This is \nbecause edge computing\
    \ enables resolving bandwidth and latency problems and reduc-\ning response time.\
    \ Following, the filtered data could be transmitted to the cloudlet plat-\nforms\
    \ for aggregation and enrichment, and running of complex analytics (Sharma et al.\
    \ \n2018).\n 5004\nY. Himeur et al.\n1 3\nThus, various use cases where edge computing\
    \ and the IoT can efficiently be utilized in \nBAMSs are emerging, among them\
    \ fault diagnosis, which helps to (i) find patterns in sen-\nsor data representing\
    \ equipment failures, anomalies, or degraded performance; (ii) detect \nabnormal\
    \ energy consumption, e.g. if the lighting or HVAC systems are activated too early\
    \ \nor operate too late with regard to the actual occupancy schedules; and (iii)\
    \ identify correla-\ntions across different types of data, which are essential\
    \ to infer the factors impacting energy \nconsumption (e.g. the patterns related\
    \ to weather, age of facilities, etc). Overall, open edge \nsoftware platforms\
    \ combine multi-protocol connectivity and the ability to aggregate data \nfrom\
    \ multiple sources and facilitate the task of advanced analytics in turning this\
    \ data into \nactionable information that can be used to improve the overall operational\
    \ efficiency build-\nings (Petri et al.).\n7  Conclusion\nThis paper carried out\
    \ a comprehensive overview of the application of AI-big data analyt-\nics in BAMSs\
    \ to conduct different tasks, including energy forecasting, fault and anomaly\
    \ \ndetection, water monitoring, and IEQ monitoring. The pros and cons of AI models\
    \ within \nthe unsupervised, supervised, semi-supervised, and reinforcement learning\
    \ categories have \nbeen identified. Moreover, it concluded that supervised learning\
    \ algorithms excelled well \nin performing the diver BAMS tasks, but their performance\
    \ always relies on the availabil-\nity of annotated data and its accuracy. Unsupervised\
    \ learning models with no prior knowl-\nedge can address this issue with less\
    \ efficiency.\nIt was demonstrated in this framework that technologies of ML,\
    \ IoT, and new connec-\ntivity capabilities have a critical role in shaping the\
    \ future of BAMSs. With building own-\ners and facility managers focusing heavily\
    \ on improving energy efficiency and increasing \ncost savings, features like\
    \ advanced fault detection and diagnostics, energy analytics, IEQ \nmonitoring,\
    \ and water management are becoming critical. The growing interest devoted to\
    \ \ndeveloping intelligent analytics in BAMSs has been highlighted by the increasing\
    \ number \nof works and studies proposed in the literature to address several\
    \ challenges. In the coming \nyears, data analytics is expected to expand the\
    \ capabilities of intelligent building technolo-\ngies, spurring further advancements\
    \ in building automation systems and equipment stand-\nards while minimizing the\
    \ environmental impact of commercial buildings.\nThe AI-big data analytics technology\
    \ is up-and-coming to BAMSs. However, it faces \nvarious challenges for achieving\
    \ market penetration, including legal, regulatory, security \nand privacy preservation,\
    \ interoperability and scalability, and competition barriers. Addi-\ntional research\
    \ initiatives, investigations, projects, and collaborations should be considered\
    \ \na primary requirement for showing if the technology can reach its absolute\
    \ power, prove its \ncommercial viability, and lastly, be adopted in the mainstream.\n\

    Digital twin-enabled smart facility management:

    A bibliometric review

    © The Author(s) 2024. This article is published with open access at link.springer.com and journal.hep.com.cn

     

    Abstract    In  recent  years,  the  architecture,  engineering,

    construction,  and  facility  management  (FM)  industries

    have been applying various emerging digital technologies

    to facilitate the design, construction, and management of

    infrastructure facilities. Digital twin (DT) has emerged as a

    solution  for  enabling  real-time  data  acquisition,  transfer,

    analysis,  and  utilization  for  improved  decision-making

    toward smart FM. Substantial research on DT for FM has

    been undertaken in the past decade. This paper presents a

    bibliometric  analysis  of  the  literature  on  DT  for  FM.  A

    total of 248 research articles are obtained from the Scopus

    and Web of Science databases. VOSviewer is then utilized

    to conduct bibliometric analysis and visualize keyword co-

    occurrence, citation, and co-authorship networks; further-

    more, the research topics, authors, sources, and countries

    contributing to the use of DT for FM are identified. The

    findings  show  that  the  current  research  of  DT  in  FM

    focuses on building information modeling-based FM, arti-

    ficial intelligence (AI)-based predictive maintenance, real-

    time  cyber–physical  system  data  integration,  and  facility

    lifecycle  asset  management.  Several  areas,  such  as  AI-

    based real-time asset prognostics and health management,

    virtual-based  intelligent  infrastructure  monitoring,  deep

    learning-aided continuous improvement of the FM systems,

    semantically rich data interoperability throughout the facil-

    ity lifecycle, and autonomous control feedback, need to be

    further  studied.  This  review  contributes  to  the  body  of

    knowledge  on  digital  transformation  and  smart  FM  by

    identifying the landscape, state-of-the-art research trends,

    and future needs with regard to DT in FM.

    1    Introduction

    The operation and maintenance (O&M) phase in facility

    lifecycle  management  is  particularly  critical  (Ali  et  al.,

    2010;  Coupry  et  al.,  2021)  because  this  phase  is  the

    longest and costliest period in the lifecycle of facilities.

    Despite  this,  it  has  been  given  relatively  little  attention

    (Lu  et  al.,  2020b).  Currently,  a  comprehensive  asset

    management plan and the ability to record, analyze, and

    use asset-related data are lacking when it comes to O&M

    (Lu  et  al.,  2020b).  In  this  context,  a  smart  facility

    management (FM) approach is demanded to sustain the

    serviceability  and  safety  of  facilities.  To  achieve  smart

    FM,  asset  management  must  be  integrated  from  the

    design and construction phase to the O&M phase and be

    digitalized (Al-Kasasbeh et al., 2020; 2021). To this end,

    researchers have targeted the application of digital tech-

    nologies  for  FM  throughout  the  facility  lifecycle.  For

    example,  in  the  last  two  decades,  building  information

    modeling (BIM) has been widely studied within the FM

    domain with the aim of improving facility maintenance,

    energy performance management, fire emergency evacu-

    ation,  indoor  environment  monitoring,  and  occupant

    comfort,  to  name  a  few  notable  applications  (Khajavi

    et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2020). However, the need for real-

    time  monitoring  and  intelligent  feedback  has  led  to  the

    evolution of BIM toward digital twin (DT). It should be

    noted that DT is a prominent technology that facilitates

    instantaneous bidirectional integration of cyber–physical

    systems and supports intelligent decision-making.

    According  to  Deng  et  al.  (2021),  DT  emerged  from

    BIM through four stages of development and integration

    with  other  technologies  that  involved  the  utilization  of

    sensors,  simulation,  and  artificial  intelligence  (AI)  at

    various  levels.  Leveraging  BIM,  DT  can  integrate  the

    information bidirectionally throughout the facility’s life-

    cycle. DT utilizes Internet of Things (IoT) technologies,

    such as smart sensors, lasers, photogrammetric tools, and

    measuring devices, to acquire real-time status information

    REVIEW ARTICLE

    about the given facility. Furthermore, DT, with the help

    of  AI  paradigms,  such  as  machine  learning  (ML)  and

    deep learning (DL), analyzes data in a real-time manner

    to  monitor  the  condition,  learn  from  the  environment,

    predict  system  failures,  and  provide  real-time  feedback

    (Agnusdei et al., 2021; Deng et al., 2021; Ozturk, 2021;

    Almatared et al., 2022; Moiceanu and Paraschiv, 2022).

    DT  has  been  shown  to  provide  proactive  maintenance

    and  diagnostic  function  by  continuously  monitoring  the

    status of the asset and helping to prevent failures (Florian

    et al., 2021; Samatas et al., 2021). Moreover, DT-based

    predictive maintenance has been shown to be more cost-

    effective  than  conventional  methods  as  it  only  requires

    maintenance  or  replacement  activity  when  failure  or

    potential failure is evident (Katona and Panfilov, 2018).

    Thus,  DT  is  an  essential  component  of  a  smart  FM

    program.

    Given  the  promise  of  DT  in  FM,  substantial  research

    has been dedicated to this emerging research area, resulting

    in many academic publications on DT in FM. Neverthe-

    less,  few  literature  review  studies  have  focused  on  DT

    applications for FM. In one of the few review studies in

    this  area,  Deng  et  al.  (2021)  performed  a  systematic

    review of 123 articles on the evolution of BIM to DT in

    the  architecture,  engineering,  construction,  and  facility

    management  (AEC-FM)  industry;  they  found  that  BIM

    integration with simulation and IoT can aid in built envi-

    ronment  monitoring,  whereas  BIM  integration  with  AI

    facilitates real-time visualization of the built environment,

    real-time  data-based  prediction,  and  automatic  control

    feedback. Almatared et al. (2022) conducted a bibliometric

    analysis of DT in the AEC industry and concluded that

    data  interoperability  issues  still  represent  an  obstacle  to

    effective data exchange, asserting that the use of DT tech-

    nologies  during  the  design,  construction,  and  O&M

    phases  of  the  facility  could  assist  with  data  integration.

    Ozturk  (2021)  conducted  a  scientometric  analysis  and

    mapping of DT in the AEC-FM industry, examining 151

    papers obtained from the Scopus database to highlight the

    research pattern and gaps, finding that big data collected

    through IoT could be used for FM and that a considerable

    gap  exists  in  information-based  predictive  management

    and utilization of information through virtual models.

    Although  these  systematic  and  bibliometric  literature

    reviews have examined DT applications in the AEC-FM

    industry  from  many  aspects,  no  previous  study  has

    provided  a  holistic  and  specialized  review  of  specific

    FM activities, such as facility asset management, during

    the  O&M  phase.  Moreover,  the  current  practice  of  DT

    for FM mainly focuses on the as-built BIM and AI or ML

    for  energy  and  maintenance  management.  Thus,  a  clear

    picture of the manner in which DT can be used to serve

    the FM sector systematically and how the in-depth inte-

    gration between DT and FM might be achieved is needed.

    However,  what  has  been  achieved  (i.e.,  research  trend)

    and what the focus of future research should be remain

    unclear.  The  landscape  of  DT  in  FM,  such  as  major

    outlets,  authors,  institutions,  topics,  and  so  forth,  also

    remains  unclear.  This  review  explores  state-of-the-art

    research literature on DT in FM, contributes to the body

    of  knowledge  through  its  quantitative  synthesis  of

    research trends, topics, sources, authors, institutions, and

    co-authorship, and identifies future research directions.

     

    2    Methods

    This  paper  aims  to  provide  a  landscape  view  of  the

    emerging DT in FM. Specifically, a bibliometric analysis

    of DT in FM was used to reveal the landscape. Traditional

    and  qualitative  reviews  draw  conclusions  based  on  the

    critical analysis of a limited number of papers and expert

    knowledge  (Liu  et  al.,  2020).  By  contrast,  the  present

    review conducts a quantitative analysis of a large amount

    of state-of-the-art literature on DT for FM to identify the

    landscape  and  presents  a  holistic  analysis  of  author

    keyword  co-occurrence,  clustering,  document  citations,

    author/co-authorship,  source,  and  country.  Furthermore,

    the  challenges  associated  with  the  identified  research

    topics  are  presented,  and  future  research  needs  are

    identified.

    As shown in Fig. 1, the bibliometric analysis consisted

    of three steps: 1) literature search, 2) bibliometric analy-

    sis,  and  3)  a  comprehensive  discussion  of  the  results.

    First, the literature was retrieved from two sources, Web

    of Science (WoS) and Scopus. Two literature databases

    were  included  to  ensure  more  comprehensive  coverage

    of  existing  literature.  Then,  bibliometric  analyses  were

    performed  to  visualize  the  co-occurrences  and  citation

    networks as these networks can help identify the research

    trends,  most  prominent  authors,  sources,  institutions,

    countries, and co-author relationships in the research area

    of DT applications in FM. Author keyword co-occurrence

    analysis was conducted to visualize the research themes

    and trends of the targeted research domain quantitatively

    because  keyword  co-occurrence  shows  the  number  of

    documents that contain the same keyword and are formed

    into clusters that allow for better representation and easy

    interpretation of the research theme results (van Eck and

    Waltman,  2022).  This  research  used  VOSviewer,  a tool

    that uses publication data to create maps for visualization

    and interpretation for bibliometric analysis (van Eck and

    Waltman,  2022).  Furthermore,  visualization  and  explo-

    ration of the network maps that result from this exercise

    help inform research trends and future needs within the

    given field. The following subsections describe in detail

    each step conducted in this process.

     2.1    Literature search

    As noted above, the literature for the bibliometric analysis

    was  retrieved  from  the  Scopus  and  WoS  databases.

    Obaidullah HAKIMI et al.  Digital twin-enabled smart facility management: A bibliometric review

    33

    Scopus  was  chosen  because  it  is  one  of  the  most  well-

    established  scientific  abstracts  and  indexing  databases.

    Compared  with  other  similar  databases,  it  has  a  more

    extensive  literature  collection  (Burnham,  2006;  Parlina

    et al., 2020; Agnusdei et al., 2021; Opoku et al., 2021).

    Most previous review studies in this area have used only

    one database as a literature source (Mongeon and Paul-

    Hus, 2016; Ozturk, 2021; Pranckutė, 2021; Moiceanu and

    Paraschiv, 2022). In this review, WoS was selected as a

    second source because of its extensive coverage of engi-

    neering and the natural sciences. Collecting articles from

    multiple databases ensures more compelling and holistic

    data results. However, existing bibliometric analysis tools

    lack  the  feature  of  being  able  to  merge  the  duplicate

    documents that may be encountered as a result of using

    multiple data sources (Ozturk, 2021), and duplicates were

    removed manually in this study. All the documents were

    then compiled in a single repository for further process-

    ing/analysis.

    A comprehensive search was performed in Scopus and

    WoS using the fields of title, abstract, and keywords. The

    keywords  in  previous  review  studies  were  used  for  the

    literature  retrieval  (Wong  et  al.,  2018;  Liu  et  al.,  2020;

    Opoku et al., 2021). Specifically, in the first field of the

    search string, the keywords “Digital Twin” OR “Digital

    Twins”  OR  “Digital-twin”  OR  “Digital  Twinning”  OR

    “Virtual  Twin”  OR  “Digital  Replica”  OR  “Virtual

    Replica”  OR  “Virtual  Counterpart”  OR  “Virtual  Repre-

    sentation”  were  used.  In  the  second  part  of  the  search

    string, the keywords “Facility Management” OR “Facili-

    ties Management” OR “Asset Management” OR “Facility

    Lifecycle Management” OR “Infrastructure Management”

    OR “Building Facility” OR “Operation and Maintenance”

    OR “O&M” OR “Smart Building” OR “Preventive Main-

    tenance”  OR  “Renovation”  were  included.  Preventive

    maintenance is included in this study instead of mainte-

    nance  to  narrow  down  the  search  toward  the  main

    purpose  of  DT  for  maintenance.  DT  is  ideally  used  to

    prevent failures through preventive maintenance. Further-

    more,  after  reviewing  the  academic  publications  in  the

    field  of  DT-enabled  FM,  preventive  maintenance  had

    been mentioned as an author keyword more remarkably.

    Additionally, a general review of academic publications

    shows  that  DT  will  replace  BIM  in  the  renovation  of

    existing facilities (Daniotti et al., 2022). The renovation

    in the literature search was to evaluate the extent of DT

    application  for  facility  renovation  practices  because

    maintenance was more specifically considered preventive

    maintenance.  “Virtual  Counterpart”  OR  “Virtual  Repre-

    sentation” is mainly interchangeably used for DT. These

    two keywords are also included in the literature retrieval

    in similar studies regarding DT (Opoku et al., 2021). As

    such, the selected keywords and their combination helped

    obtain more relevant publications (Kaewunruen and Xu,

    2018; Felsberger et al., 2019; Angjeliu et al., 2020; Chen

    et al., 2021; Neto et al., 2021).

    The period for the bibliometric literature search was set

    as from January 2012 to March 2022, and the language

    was  limited  to  English  only.  In  Scopus,  the  document

    types,  such  as  conference  papers  and  articles  under  the

    research  areas  of  engineering,  computer  sciences,  envi-

    ronment  sciences,  decision  science,  and  energy,  were

    used; in WoS, the document types include proceedings,

    papers, and articles under the research areas of engineer-

    ing, computer sciences, construction building technology,

    automation  control  systems,  science–technology,  envi-

    ronmental science, and energy. The search resulted in 315

    papers from Scopus and 110 papers from WoS, and these

    papers  were  further  screened  using  a  title  and  abstract

    review.  Duplicates  were  removed,  and  248  documents

    were  eventually  identified  and  manually  combined.

    Figure 2 summarizes the process flow chart for the litera-

    ture retrieval.

     2.2    Overview of retrieved literature

    Figure  3  shows  the  article  distribution  over  time.  As

    shown  in  the  figure,  the  number  of  publications  from

    2017 to March 2022 considerably increased compared to

    the  period  between  2012  and  2017,  with  nearly  all  the

    papers on the topic of DT in FM being published during

    this period. Figure 4 shows that the concentration of DT

    research within the FM field has been highly focused on

    the engineering and computer science domain, implying

    that  digital  transformation  and  intelligent  automation

    approaches in FM are mainly computer-aided and engi-

    neering-centric.

    The  distribution  of  academic  documents  in  various

    fields indicates that the highest concentration of publica-

    tions  is  in  engineering,  followed  by  computer  science,

    energy, construction building technology, and automation

    control systems. The reason is that the digital transforma-

    tion  of  the  AEC  industry  and  the  need  for  smart  FM

    require computer-aided technologies that facilitate cyber–

    physical system integration. Automation and instantaneous

    control feedback require the use of AI, such as ML and

    DL, which are computer-centric. In addition, Construction

    4.0  is  the  transformation  of  construction  practices  to

    embrace  digital  technologies,  such  as  BIM,  augmented

    reality (AR)/virtual reality (VR), AI, and IoT, for smart

    construction  practices.  Construction  4.0  uses  smart

    construction building technologies, robotics for construc-

    tion, digitalization, and automation to integrate the plan-

    ning and design phase with O&M while also facilitating

    real-time  monitoring,  predictive  maintenance,  and  auto-

    matic  control  feedback  throughout  the  facility  lifecycle.

    Meanwhile,  sustainable  and  smart  facility  operation

    demands  energy  performance  management  and  indoor

    environment monitoring and comfort. This demand may

    be the reason for energy being the focus of many studies

    on DT in FM.

    Figure 5 presents the classification of scientific docu-

    ments  published  on  DT  in  FM  from  January  2012  to

    March 2022 by publication type. As shown in the figure,

    55% of the publications identified are conference papers,

    whereas 45% are journal articles.

     

    3    Bibliometric results

    The  bibliometric  analysis  mainly  focuses  on  studying

    documents,  authors,  keywords,  and  sources  through

    network mapping and clustering (Waltman et al., 2010).

    This section presents the results of bibliometric analysis

    and the corresponding network visualization maps.

     3.1    Co-occurrence of author keywords

    All the documents identified from Scopus and WoS were

    fed into VOSviewer to identify co-occurrences of author

    keywords.  The  threshold  for  keyword  occurrences  was

    set at 3. A thesaurus file was developed and used for data

    cleaning.  A  thesaurus  file  identifies  the  redundant

    keywords and combines them with one label to enhance

    network  visualization  (van  Eck  and  Waltman,  2022).  A

    total of 36 of the 701 keywords met the criteria. These

    keywords  that  met  this  threshold  were  mapped  in  the

    keyword network and were visualized, as shown in Fig. 6.

    Each node in Fig. 6 represents one keyword, whereas

     

    Fig. 5    Scientific  publications  on  the  topic  of  DT  in  FM  by

    document type.

     

    Fig. 6    Co-occurrence network of author keywords related to DT in FM.

    36

    Front. Eng. Manag. 2024, 11(1): 32–49

    the  color-coded  node’s  size  represents  the  keyword’s

    occurrence. The relatedness of a given keyword to other

    keywords is indicated by the attributes of links, i.e., the

    number of links and total link strength. The strength of

    the  link  indicates  the  number  of  documents  in  which

    two  keywords  appear  together.  The  distance  between

    keywords  indicates  the  degree  of  relatedness  between

    them: Close proximity between two keywords implies a

    strong relationship between them. The number of links to

    a  given  keyword  shows  its  relativeness  to  the  research

    clusters or topics; the higher the number of links is, the

    stronger the relativeness of the keyword is considered to

    be.  The  number  of  links  and  their  correlation  explicitly

    indicate  the  trend  and  are  representative  of  the  DT

    research in the FM industry.

    The co-occurrence analysis also identified seven clusters

    through this process, and their constituent keywords are

    listed in Table 1. The clusters were named as listed on the

    basis of the most prominent topic to which the keywords

    in the cluster are related, keeping with the principles of

    information theory. The color coding in Fig. 6 and noted

    in  parentheses  for  each  cluster  in  Table  1  indicates  the

    cluster  to  which  each  keyword  belongs.  Information

    regarding  the  number  of  occurrences,  links,  total  link

    strength,  the  average  number  of  citations,  and  average

    publication year is also provided in Table 1. As shown in

    Table 1, the keywords were clustered into seven categories

    using  the  clustering  techniques  in  VOSviewer,  with  the

    resulting network consisting of 36 keywords, 171 links,

    and a total link strength of 402. As shown in the table,

    “lifecycle  management”  received  the  highest  average

    number of citations (32.00), followed by “anomaly detec-

    tion” (10.80), “maintenance” (9.40), “asset management”

    (9.21), “Industry 4.0” (8.27), “Internet of Things” (8.21),

    and “digitalization” (8.00). The co-occurrence analysis of

    author  keywords  identified  “bridges”,  “computational

    modeling”, “operation and maintenance”, “management”,

    and “optimization” as keywords with very recent occur-

    rences with regard to the application of DT in FM. These

    keywords, along with “digital twin”, have mainly been in

    use in the scientific literature within this area since late

    2020. Furthermore, all of these keywords, in the context

    of  DT  applications  in  FM,  are  relatively  new,  with  an

    average publication year of late 2019. The average publi-

    cation analysis indicates that the application of DT tech-

    nology for FM is still new, and, with a focus on digital

    transformation  and  technology  advancement,  it  can  be

    expected to flourish in the coming year.

    The findings with regard to the average number of cita-

    tions indicate that DT in FM is still relatively new. They

    also  show  that  lifecycle  management  is  an  important

    topic in FM, with the highest average number of citations

    (as  noted  above),  whereas  smart  asset  management,

    maintenance,  IoT,  and  digital  transformation  are  also

    important  topics  in  this  area.  The  keywords  related  to

    enabling technologies of DT and its application for FM

    with  the  lower  average  number  of  citations  were  found

    to  be  “prognostics  and  health  management”  (3.67),

    “machine learning” (1.89), “artificial intelligence” (1.60),

    “sustainability”  (1.40),  “simulation”  (1.00),  and  “deep

    learning”  (0.67).  Again,  further  research  is  needed  with

    regard  to  AI/VR-based  sustainable  FM,  computerized

    maintenance  management  systems,  DT-based  intelligent

    infrastructure  monitoring,  and  semantic  interoperability

    for  smart  asset  management.  The  following  subsections

    describe the identified clusters in further detail.

     3.1.1    AI-based predictive maintenance (red)

    The  most  prominent  keywords  in  this  cluster  were

    “predictive maintenance”, with 13 occurrences and a total

    link strength of 40; “artificial intelligence”, with 10 occur-

    rences and a total link strength of 31; and “simulation”,

    with  6  occurrences  and  a  total  link  strength  of  9.  The

    degree  of  relatedness  of  these  keywords  and  their  link

    strength  indicate  that  AI  must  be  utilized  to  achieve

    predictive  maintenance  goals  and  sustain  the  operation

    of the facility.

    This  cluster  presents  the  research  area  of  predictive

    maintenance  and  AI-based  algorithms  of  ML  and  DL

    intended to facilitate smart maintenance. AI, such as ML

    and  DL,  shows  tremendous  potential  in  real-time  data

    analysis,  minimizing  maintenance  costs  and  optimizing

    the  facility’s  operational  performance  (Cardoso  and

    Ferreira, 2021). Predictive maintenance, for instance, is a

    diagnostic strategy that continuously evaluates the condi-

    tion of the asset through various sensors. It also uses AI-

    based  algorithms  to  provide  automatic  feedback  so  that

    action  can  be  taken  when  needed  to  avoid  failure  and

    unnecessary  incurrence  of  costs  (Florian  et  al.,  2021;

    Samatas  et  al.,  2021).  AI-based  predictive  maintenance

    and anomaly detection have thus been the focus of many

    recent  research  studies  within  the  FM  sector  aimed  at

    facilitating  real-time  data  acquisition,  analysis,  and

    utilization  for  effective  decision-making  (Lu  et  al.,

    2020b; Xie et al., 2020; Samatas et al., 2021). The main

    challenge  in  achieving  effective  AI-based  predictive

    maintenance  is  that  most  existing  facilities  do  not  have

    digital models that would facilitate the application of AI

    computational  models  and  learn  from  the  process  to

    enhance improved and proactive decision-making. Thus,

    “computational modeling”, with 3 occurrences and a total

    link strength of 5, “deep learning” (3, 4), and “digitaliza-

    tion” (3, 9) are the least studied keywords in this cluster

    and  the  most  recently  studied  topics,  with  an  average

    publication  year  of  late  2021,  2021,  and  late  2019,

    respectively.  Thus,  the  digitalization  of  built  assets,  AI

    technology, the application of simulation for FM, and the

    use  of  computational  modeling  through  computerized

    maintenance management systems to simulate, visualize,

    analyze,  and  manage  assets  throughout  the  lifecycle

    toward  smart  FM  must  be  further  explored  through

    research and case studies.

     3.1.2    Real-time cyber–physical integration (green)

    Data acquisition and integration have been the focus of

    many studies. As evidence of this trend, the most influential

    keywords  in  this  cluster  were  identified  as  “Internet  of

    Things”, with 29 occurrences and a total link strength of

    68;  “Industry  4.0”  (11,  24),  “smart  cities”  (9,  19),  and

    “big data” (7, 18). “Sensors”, with 5 occurrences and a

    total  link  strength  of  16,  and  “prognostics  and  health

    management” (3, 10) are the least studied topics in this

    cluster  and  are  attracting  increasing  attention  in  recent

    research,  with  an  average  publication  year  of  late  2020

    and early 2020, respectively. These findings indicate that

    having real-time data sensing of facility operation is vital.

    However,  to  achieve  real-time  asset  management,  inte-

    grating the big data gathered from the physical asset with

    its virtual counterpart is also vital. In this regard, DT is a

    technology that connects the physical entity to its virtual

    model  in  real-time;  it  can  precisely  predict  failures  and

    integrate high-quality data into virtual and physical prod-

    ucts (Ozturk, 2021).

    This  cluster  emphasizes  the  importance  of  real-time

    data acquisition through IoT technologies and the integra-

    tion  of  digital  models  with  their  physical  counterparts.

    Real-time  cyber–physical  integration  facilitates  data-

    driven interconnectivity and automation in FM practices.

     3.1.3    Digital FM (blue)

    The most important keywords in this cluster were found

    to  be  “building  information  modeling”,  with  40  occur-

    rences  and  a  total  link  strength  of  81,  and  “facility

    management” (20, 56). The results indicate that BIM is

    highly  related  and  required  for  smart  FM.  BIM  is  an

    essential component of the DT paradigm and is used as a

    source of information on existing facilities. As such, the

    use of BIM as a means of facilitating smart FM has been

    the focus of extensive research (Liu et al., 2020). Mean-

    while, the results show that “augmented reality”, with 5

    occurrences  and  a  total  link  strength  of  13,  “anomaly

    detection” (5, 9), and “maintenance” (5, 6) have been the

    least studied topics in this cluster. AR has been shown to

    be useful in particular applications, such as in fire emer-

    gency evacuation for showing the optimal route and guid-

    ing  the  occupant  to  safety  (Zhu  and  Li,  2021),  and  for

    tracking construction progress by superimposing a virtual

    model  on  the  physical  space  (Schiavi  et  al.,  2022).

    However, the holistic application of AR for FM warrants

    further study because a solution for accurately superim-

    posing  the  geometry  of  the  VR  model  on  its  physical

    counterpart has yet to be proposed. Similarly, while DT

    technology and as-is BIM models for anomaly detection

    in manufacturing, transmission systems, smart grid, wind

    turbines, engines, and other machines have been widely

    studied, and the associated benefits have been explored, a

    comprehensive  FM  approach  for  intelligent  anomaly

    detection in smart maintenance has yet to be established

    (Zeng et al., 2020; Xie et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2021).

     3.1.4    As-built/As-is modeling (yellow)

    In this cluster, the most influential keyword was found to

    be  “monitoring”,  with  4  occurrences  and  a  total  link

    strength  of  13,  followed  by  “bridges”  (3,  8),  and  “data

    analytics”  (3,  8).  These  results  demonstrate  that  smart

    infrastructure  monitoring  and  management  can  be

    achieved  by  digitalizing  assets  and  utilizing  automatic

    data analytics algorithms. Civil infrastructure refers to the

    fundamental facilities that ensure the sustainable operation

    of the economy and society. In many developed countries,

    civil  infrastructure  is  deteriorating  and  requires  smart

    monitoring and maintenance (Shim et al., 2019). In this

    regard, DT technology can be used to, for example, create

    virtual models of bridges for real-time condition monitor-

    ing,  performance  evaluation,  automatic  feedback,  and

    decision-making  (Shim  et  al.,  2019;  Ye  et  al.,  2019;

    2020).  The  results  for  this  cluster  indicate  that  “digital

    transformation”,  with  3  occurrences  and  a  total  link

    strength of 4, and “management” (3, 6) are the least studied

    topics in this cluster and the focus of recent studies, with

    an average publication year of early 2021.

    This cluster emphasizes the need for digitalization and

    the  creation  of  digital  models  for  infrastructural  assets.

    Creating an as-built or as-is model is an important step in

    the  real-time  monitoring  process  because  it  allows  for

    creating  and  managing  a  digital  representation  of  the

    infrastructure that reflects its actual physical and functional

    characteristics.  Smart  infrastructure  monitoring  and

    management  can  be  achieved  by  digitalizing  assets  and

    utilizing automatic data analytics algorithms.

     3.1.5    Intelligent prognostics and health management

    (purple)

    The most prominent keywords in this cluster were found

    to be “digital twin”, with 139 occurrences and a total link

    strength  of  192,  and  “machine  learning”  (9,  22).  The

    results indicate that health monitoring and estimating the

    remaining useful life of a facility during the O&M phase

    require the application of DT technology. DT technology

    can be used to update databases in real-time and facilitate

    effective O&M of facilities. AI technologies, such as ML,

    have  been  widely  studied  and  have  been  shown  to  be

    effective tools for organizing and analyzing the big data

    collected  in  real-time  using  IoT  technologies.  ML,  in

    particular, facilitates automation in decision-making and

    has  been  applied  for  various  purposes  in  the  fields  of

    Obaidullah HAKIMI et al.  Digital twin-enabled smart facility management: A bibliometric review

    39

    smart  manufacturing,  prognostics,  health  management,

    energy,  transportation,  and  smart  cities  (Rathore  et  al.,

    2021). In this cluster, “wind turbine”, with 3 occurrences

    and a total link strength of 6, was found to be the least

    studied keyword. The result indicates that DT application

    for  smart  infrastructural  asset  management  is  the  least

    studied topic. In addition, to achieve smart FM, the facil-

    ity’s remaining useful life during the O&M phase must

    be understood through real-time intelligent monitoring.

    This cluster focuses on remaining useful life estimation

    and facility health monitoring. Remaining useful life esti-

    mation  and  structural  health  monitoring  are  essential

    parts  of  FM;  however,  civil  facilities  lack  intelligent

    prognostic  systems  for  accurate  health  monitoring.  DT

    has  the  potential  for  remaining  useful  life  prediction,

    whereas  real-time  monitoring  technologies  are  used  to

    collect  complex  data,  and  holistic  ML  algorithms  are

    developed to facilitate the integration of historical data;

    their  fusion  with  the  heterogeneous  data  from  several

    parts  of  the  structure  provides  an  accurate  indication

    regarding  the  health  of  the  facility.  Estimation  of  the

    remaining useful life of an asset assists facility managers

    with budget allocation and scheduling for renovation or

    disposal. While AI-based predictive maintenance utilizes

    real-time  data  to  identify  potential  issues  before  they

    occur  and  schedule  maintenance  activities  accordingly,

    remaining  useful  life  estimation  is  used  to  predict  the

    remaining lifespan of an asset.

     3.1.6    Asset lifecycle management (light blue)

    The most influential keyword in this cluster was found to

    be “asset management”. This cluster presents the impor-

    tance  of  FM  throughout  the  lifecycle.  Facility  asset

    management has been the focus of a considerable volume

    of  research,  and  its  advantages  have  been  widely

    explored. However, the concept of lifecycle management,

    which considers the management of a facility from plan-

    ning to construction to O&M, is a relatively new concept

    that emerged in the 21st century (Ozturk, 2021).

     3.1.7    Semantic interoperability (brown)

    “Smart  building”  was  found  to  be  the  most  influential

    keyword in this cluster, with 12 occurrences and a total

    link strength of 21. “Ontology” was found to be the least

    prominent keyword, with 4 occurrences and a total link

    strength of 8. Smart buildings utilize intelligent technology

    and BIM to achieve efficient, comfortable, and sustainable

    FM throughout the lifecycle (Baracho et al., 2019). This

    cluster indicates that meaningful interoperability is essen-

    tial for achieving smart FM.

     3.2    Citation analysis

     3.2.1    Documents

    Citation  analysis  was  applied  to  gain  insights  into  the

    most influential publications on the topic of DT in FM. In

    VOSviewer, the minimum number of citations of a docu-

    ment was set at 30, resulting in the identification of the

    10 most cited documents in this area. A closer look at the

    10 most cited documents reveals that most documents are

    focused on theory. This finding suggests that the applica-

    tion  of  DT  in  FM  is  still  early  in  its  maturation  and

    requires more case studies and practical applications. A

    detailed  look  at  the  10  most  cited  publications  on  DT

    application in FM (listed in Table 2) also underscores the

    importance  of  DT  for  real-time  asset  monitoring  and

    predictive maintenance and sheds light on the advantages,

    DT limitations, and future research needs of DT in asset

    management.

    For  instance,  Jain  et  al.  (2020)  developed  a  highly

    sensitive  DT  approach  for  fault  diagnosis  in  distributed

    photovoltaics with remarkable potential for application in

    smart buildings, conducting simulation and experimental

    studies  to  validate  their  DT  model.  Similarly,  Lu  et  al.

    (2020b) presented and successfully tested a DT-enabled

    anomaly  detection  system  for  asset  monitoring  and  its

    data  integration  based  on  extended  industry  foundation

    classes  (IFC)  for  daily  O&M  management.  Using  cen-

    trifugal  pumps  in  a  heating  ventilation  air  conditioning

    (HVAC) system as a case study, they modified the IFC

    schema to include the data received from the pump (e.g.,

    ifcpump)  and  used  ifcObject  matching  to  link  the  BIM

    model  of  the  pump  with  the  sensor  ID  in  the  sensor

    system. They also used vibration sensors to monitor the

    operation behavior and vibration frequency of the pump

    and used AI and a Bayesian online change point detection

    algorithm  to  identify  and  filter  anomalies  from  normal

    operation through cross-checking.

    Wagg et al. (2020) presented a state-of-the-art method

    of DT application in engineering dynamics, describing a

    wind  turbine  case  as  an  example  of  asset  management.

    Their  work  also  presented  a  case  study  of  a  three-story

    structure to illustrate the modeling challenges associated

    with applying DT in the construction phase. A mathemat-

    ical  framework  was  developed  for  DT  application  in

    engineering dynamics. Shim et al. (2019) proposed a DT-

    based bridge maintenance system for effective decision-

    making;  they  used  a  3D  model  connected  to  a  digital

    inspection system that uses image processing in combina-

    tion with data obtained across the lifecycle of the project

    from  the  initial  phases  of  design  and  construction  to

    O&M.  Similarly,  Sivalingam  et  al.  (2018)  proposed  a

    physics-based DT framework that helps predict the useful

    life  of  offshore  wind  turbines  and  facilitates  predictive

    maintenance.  Moreover,  Kaewunruen  and  Xu  (2018)

    explored  a  sustainability  evaluation  model  using  DT.

    They used a Revit-based simulation of construction activ-

    ities for a building at a railway station, considering a 6D

    BIM  application  encompassing  time,  cost,  and  carbon

    emission  estimation.  Lu  et  al.  (2020a)  presented  a

    comprehensive  framework  for  DT  development  at  the

    building and city levels; the system architecture was used

    to create a DT of the West Cambridge site at University

    of  Cambridge  in  the  UK,  a  resource  that  facilitates  the

    integration of data from various sources, supports effective

    data acquisition and analysis, facilitates decision-making

    during the O&M phase, and strengthens the relationship

    between humans and buildings/cities.

    Wong  et  al.  (2018)  conducted  a  holistic,  systematic

    review  of  the  importance  of  digitization  in  FM.  Their

    review encompassed various DTs for FM and shed light

    on future research needs (e.g., data interoperability, and

    BIM/geographic information system (GIS) asset database

    integration). Similarly, Macchi et al. (2018) presented a

    state-of-the-art exploratory study emphasizing the impor-

    tance  of  DT  for  decision-making  in  asset  lifecycle

    management.  Meanwhile,  Love  and  Matthews  (2019)

    explored the potential benefits of DT adaptation for asset

    management.  Their  study  relied  on  empirical  findings

    from nine projects evaluating the benefits of digitalization

    for asset management. They concluded that digital trans-

    formation and system information modeling could generate

    considerable business value and productivity.

     3.2.2    Sources

    Sources of academic publications are great indicators of

    the value and  significance of  the research  literature.  To

    present a broader list of sources for academic publications

    an average of 7.82 citations per publication, and an average

    publication year of 2020.39. The second most influential

    country  was  found  to  be  the  US,  with  27  publications

    receiving 193 citations in total, with an average of 7.15

    citations per publication and an average publication year

    of 2020.30. The US was followed closely by Italy, with

    32 publications garnering a total of 192 citations, repre-

    senting an average of 6.00 citations per publication. Italy

    was followed by Australia, China, Germany, South Korea,

    Norway, Spain, and Finland.

    Even though China has been productive in terms of the

    number of publications (51 documents), the UK has been

    the  most  influential  country,  with  its  documents  being

    highly cited by other academic publications. Furthermore,

    although Australia published comparatively fewer docu-

    ments  (9),  these  received  132  citations,  representing  an

    average of 14.67 citations per publication, illustrating the

    significance  and  strong  impact  of  these  documents.  All

    the documents were found to have a recent average publi-

    cation year (ranging from late 2019 to late 2020), indicating

    that the topic of DT in FM has been gaining momentum

    in  recent  years.  Table  5  presents  the  list  of  the  highest

    contributing  countries,  whereas  Fig.  9  is  the  network

    visualization map of the most influential countries in the

    research area of DT in FM.

     3.3    Co-authorship analysis

     3.3.1    Authors

    To identify instances of research collaboration in the area

    of DT in FM, the minimum number of documents by a

    given author was set at 4 in VOSviewer. The minimum

    number of citations garnered by a given author was set at

    25, yielding a list of five authors representing the highest

    co-authorship strength with respect to the topic of DT in

    FM.  Table  6  presents  the  co-authorship  analysis  of

    authors, including their total link strength, the number of

    documents they have published, and the number of cita-

    tions received. Figure 10 provides the network visualiza-

    tion  map  of  the  collaboration  between  authors  in  the

    research area of DT in FM.

    As also shown in the results of the citation analysis of

    authors,  the  co-authorship  analysis  of  authors  indicated

    that the most prominent authors coauthoring documents

    in the area of DT applications for FM are Parlikad A K,

    with a total link strength of 22, Xie X (20), Lu Q (17),

    Schooling J M (12), and Heaton J (7). All the mentioned

    authors  are  from  either  University  of  Cambridge  or

    University College London in the UK.

     3.3.2    Countries

    Scientific  collaboration  helps  maximize  the  impact  of

    research  by  exchanging  ideas  and  skills.  Thus,  under-

    standing  the  international  scientific  collaboration  trends

    and identifying prominent scientists and countries in the

    field  of  DT  in  FM  are  essential.  To  understand  the

    connection and degree of cooperation between countries

    with respect to DT in FM, the five most cooperative and

    connected  countries  were  determined  accordingly.  The

    minimum number of documents of a country was set at 5

    in VOSviewer, and the minimum number of citations of a

    country  was  set  at  95.  Table  7  summarizes  the  most

    collaborative countries in terms of co-publishing scientific

    documents  on  the  topic  of  DT  in  FM  internationally,

    whereas Fig. 11 shows the link and network mapping of

    international co-authorship of scientific documents in the

    research area of DT in FM by country. The analysis indi-

    cated that China is the most prominent country, with its

    researchers  having  co-published  51  documents  interna-

    tionally and having a total link strength of 7. China was

    followed by the UK, with its researchers having coauthored

    38  publications  with  researchers  from  other  countries,

    representing a total link strength of 6. Italy was found to

    be the third most influential country, with authors from

    Italy  having  co-published  32  documents  internationally,

    representing a total link strength of 3. Researchers from

    the  US,  meanwhile,  coauthored  27  publications  with

    researchers from other countries, representing a total link

    strength of 4. Finally, Australia was identified as the fifth

    prominent  country  with  Australian  authors  having

    contributed to 9 internationally coauthored documents.

     

    4    Discussion and future needs

    The author keyword clustering analysis identified seven

    main  research  areas  of  DT  applications  in  FM.  These

    areas  include  1)  AI-based  predictive  maintenance,

    2)  real-time  cyber–physical  integration,  3)  digital  FM,

    4) as-built/as-is modeling, 5) intelligent prognostics and

    health management, 6) asset lifecycle management, and

    7)  semantic  interoperability.  In  general,  monitoring  and

    collecting  real-time  data  from  assets  through  IoT  tech-

    nologies,  analyzing  the  data  for  informed  decision-

    making and control feedback, and integrating the physical

    asset with the corresponding BIM model for information

    visualization are vital. BIM, IoT, predictive maintenance,

    and asset management were found to be the most studied

    topics in the research area of DT in FM. Automation and

    smart FM require the digitalization of built assets, utiliza-

    tion of computational modeling for data analytics, contin-

    uous improvement of FM systems, AR/VR-based visual-

    ization  for  facility  maintenance,  and  AI-based  real-time

    asset prognostics and health management. All these were

    the research focus in 2021 and are warranted for further

    research. Specifically, future research areas include 1) the

    potential of DT for prognostics and health management

    of  facilities;  2)  the  creation  of  fully  automated  and

    semantically rich DT of the existing infrastructural assets;

    3) interoperability of semantically rich data between BIM

    and FM; 4) intelligent anomaly detection for smart main-

    tenance; 5) DT applications in facility lifecycle manage-

    ment, and 6) the use of big data collected using IoT tech-

    nology  in  combination  with  ML  algorithms  for  data

    analysis and utilization. This section provides an in-depth

    discussion of each research area in an attempt to reveal

    the research challenges, limitations, and future needs.

     4.1    AI-based predictive maintenance

    Predictive  maintenance  is  a  diagnostic  strategy  that

    continuously evaluates the asset’s condition on the basis

    of sensor-collected data. It demands AI-based algorithms

    to provide automatic feedback so that action can be taken

    when needed to avoid failure and unnecessary incurrence

    of costs (Florian et al., 2021; Samatas et al., 2021). AI,

    such as ML and DL, show tremendous potential in real-

    time  data  analysis,  minimizing  maintenance  costs  and

    optimizing

     the

     facility’s

     operational

     performance

    (Cardoso  and  Ferreira,  2021).  Simulation  has  also  been

    proven to be able to optimize real-time data utilization for

    predicting  performance,  optimizing  maintenance,  and

    easily accommodating changes (Wagg et al., 2020). Thus,

    since  2020,  predictive  maintenance  has  garnered  more

    attention than preventive maintenance to achieve sustain-

    able  and  smart  maintenance  management.  Preventive

    maintenance is conducted on the basis of a prescheduled

    plan to avoid failure. However, conducting a given main-

    tenance activity at the scheduled time may not be neces-

    sary, meaning that preventive maintenance is not a cost-

    efficient  strategy  (Samatas  et  al.,  2021).  By  contrast,

    predictive maintenance is a fully autonomous, smart, and

    sustainable  strategy  that  monitors  the  condition  of  the

    asset and predicts future failure and remaining useful life

    accordingly. Predictive maintenance is more cost-effective

    than preventive maintenance because it only prescribes a

    maintenance or replacement activity when imminent fail-

    ure is evident (Katona and Panfilov, 2018).

    AI-based failure detection using sensor-gathered data is

    a straightforward application for a specific type of failure;

    however,  predicting  failures  that  indirectly  impact  the

    data  from  various  sensors  is  a  challenge  (Klein  and

    Bergmann, 2019). AI applications for FM are data imbal-

    anced  because  failures  are  rare  during  the  facility’s  life

    cycle  in  comparison  with  normal  operations.  It  would

    lead to discrepancies in the performance of the algorithms

    that tend to classify the most occurring instances to train

    the model for prediction and eventually reduce the preci-

    sion of the failure prediction (Klein and Bergmann, 2019;

    Cardoso  and  Ferreira,  2021;  Samatas  et  al.,  2021).  As

    such, future research should focus on AI for the appropriate

    interrelation  and  interpretation  of  data  from  various

    sensor streams. Given such data imbalance, how to fuse

    human  inputs  into  the  sensor-collected  data  for  reliable

    decision-making (i.e., human in the loop) remains unclear

    and  a  challenge.  In  addition,  algorithms  that  transfer

    learning  from  a  failure  model,  instead  of  predefined

    attributes,  must  be  implemented.  Learning  from  the

    process  concept,  which  continuously  monitors  the  data

    and  learns  from  the  operation  process,  must  be  consid-

    ered.

     4.2    Real-time cyber–physical integration

    DT technology collects real-time data (e.g., environmental

    data, human feedback, and certain product data), leverag-

    ing all kinds of IoT sensors (e.g., closed circuit television

    (CCTV), cameras, radio frequency identification (RFID),

    and  so  forth).  These  data  could  be  transferred  using  a

    wireless  sensor  network.  The  utilization  of  IoT  in  DT-

    based  FM  and  its  associated  benefits  have  been  widely

    studied. In this regard, a digital transformation and tech-

    nological  revolution  through  real-time  data  integration,

    automation, cyber–physical systems, and interconnectivity

    are required to achieve smart FM. The emergence of new

    technologies  facilitating  rapid  interconnectivity  and

    process automation led to the fourth industrial revolution

    known as Industry 4.0 (Moiceanu and Paraschiv, 2022).

    In this respect, IoT technology is a critical factor in the

    Industry 4.0 revolution because it links the physical and

    digital domains in real time to allow for comprehensive

    collaboration. As such, IoT in the context of Industry 4.0

    was widely studied in 2020, with its associated benefits

    well documented.

    IoT and cyber–physical systems also play a crucial role

    in  achieving  smart  cities  because  they  can  assist  with

    collecting and exchanging the required data for improved

    operation and management of civil infrastructure assets.

    In  this  regard,  the  main  challenges  in  real-time  data

    acquisition  in  FM  are  the  ability  of  sensors  to  read

    complex civil facility-related data and the interoperability

    of a large set of data that needs to be exchanged between

    various  systems  and  analyzed  for  improved  decision-

    making.  Furthermore,  IoT  sensors  are  supposed  to

    capture high volume and high velocity of data in real time.

    Data acquisition through sensor networks on the extensive

    facility  level  remains  challenging  due  to  the  sensor

    network  connectivity  problems  between  heterogeneous

    devices and the interoperable exchange with the IoT gate-

    way (Rathore et al., 2021). The real-time data acquisition

    of multiple facilities through IoT tools and system inte-

    gration with stakeholders is still not reliable (Villa et al.,

    2021). To utilize this big data for prediction and decision-

    making,  the  storage,  management,  processing,  analysis,

    visualization, and exchange of data, which remain a big

    challenge and focus of current research, are vital (Rathore

    et  al.,  2021).  Future  research  must  focus  on  large-scale

    heterogeneous  sensor  network  interconnectivity  and

    utilization of AI for managing, processing, and exchanging

    big data.

     4.3    Digital FM

    BIM  enables  effective  and  efficient  data  integration

    throughout the lifecycle of the facility (Xie et al., 2020).

    BIM models contain semantically rich information on the

    facility  components  that  can  be  used  to  understand  the

    condition of the facility and have been deployed in such

    applications  as  fire  emergency  evacuation,  energy

    management,  and  facility  operation  (Pishdad-Bozorgi,

    2017).  During  the  O&M  phase,  BIM-enabled  FM  can

    help  with  information  retrieval,  locating  assets,  energy

    optimization,

     and

     smart

     maintenance

     scheduling.

    Although BIM has been extensively utilized as the source

    of  virtual  information  for  smart  FM,  data  requirements

    Obaidullah HAKIMI et al.  Digital twin-enabled smart facility management: A bibliometric review

    45

    from  BIM  to  FM  activities  and  interoperability  are  still

    big challenges (Liu et al., 2020). The interoperability of

    semantically rich data is another notable challenge. Fortu-

    nately, IFC, as an open international data format, has the

    potential  to  resolve  the  interoperability  issue  and  help

    information  exchange  without  loss  of  semantics  (Di

    Ciaccio et al., 2021). Lu et al. (2020b) presented a DT-

    enabled anomaly detection system for asset management

    and its data integration based on extended IFC for daily

    O&M management. They used centrifugal pumps in the

    HVAC  system  as  a  case  study  and  modified  the  IFC

    schema  to  include  the  data  that  are  received  from  the

    pump (e.g., ifcpump); they also used ifcObject to link the

    BIM model of the pump with the sensor ID in the sensor

    system. However, IFC still has many limitations for facility

    indoor  localization,  such  as  geometric  errors  and  chal-

    lenges with querying dynamic information with IFC data

    (Liu  et  al.,  2021).  The  quantitative  results  also  indicate

    that AI, such as ML and DL, are core technologies with

    the potential to facilitate smart FM due to their capacity

    to organize big data effectively for use in informed deci-

    sion-making. Therefore, future research on BIM for FM

    can  focus  on  managing  and  exchanging  real-time  data

    using  extended  IFC  schema  for  facility  indoor  localiza-

    tion.

     4.4    As-built/As-is modeling

    The challenges with smart infrastructure monitoring and

    management are the difficulty and complexity associated

    with monitoring all facility assets in real-time (given that

    civil facilities are typically large and complex and entail a

    high degree of variability). However, most infrastructure

    lacks digital and semantically rich models; digital trans-

    formation and the creation of as-built models are necessary

    for  infrastructure  monitoring  and  management  (Lu  and

    Brilakis,  2019).  Remote  sensing  and  point  clouds  are

    promising solutions for achieving this (Lu and Brilakis,

    2019; Liu et al., 2020). Various smart technologies have

    been  explored  for  routine  monitoring  of  infrastructure

    facilities,  e.g.,  multitemporal  interferometric  synthetic

    aperture  radar  (MT-InSAR)  for  deformation  measure-

    ment, localized structural health monitoring sensors, and

    nondestructive testing (NDT) (Macchiarulo et al., 2022;

    Tosti et al., 2021). Still, the magnitude and remoteness of

    the infrastructure assets make real-time monitoring (i.e.,

    capturing  performance  data)  economically  unviable.  In

    addition, integrating information from satellite and in-situ

    NDT is still a challenge; furthermore, the permanent scat-

    terer for MT-InSAR has limitations with target accuracy

    and  reliability  for  large/fast  deformations  (Macchiarulo

    et al., 2022; Tosti et al., 2021). Therefore, future research

    must focus on algorithms of robust satellite data that can

    capture accurate structural health-related information. In

    addition,  energy-efficient  IoT  systems  are  demanded  to

    transmit  fast  and  reliable  data  for  smart  infrastructure

    monitoring  and  management  (Macchiarulo  et  al.,  2022;

    Khujamuratov  et  al.,  2022).  Further  study  is  needed  on

    the creation of fully automated and semantically rich DT

    of existing infrastructural assets.

     4.5    Intelligent prognostics and health management

    Remaining  useful  life  estimation  and  structural  health

    monitoring are essential parts of FM; however, civil facil-

    ities  lack  intelligent  prognostic  systems  for  accurate

    health monitoring. The major challenge with civil facili-

    ties’  intelligent  prognostics  is  the  limitation  of  current

    IoT in accurately predicting the remaining useful life due

    to  various  construction  materials,  complex  functionality

    of structural members, and complex failure mechanisms.

    To resolve this issue, future research should focus on DT

    application for intelligent prognostics and facility mainte-

    nance, where real-time monitoring technologies are used

    to collect complex data, and holistic ML algorithms are

    developed  to  facilitate  the  integration  of  historical  data

    and their fusion with the heterogeneous data from several

    parts of the structure and provide an accurate indication

    regarding  the  health  of  the  facility.  Although  DT  has

    been  successfully  applied  in  industrial,  aerospace,  and

    energy fields to predict the remaining useful life of assets,

    the study of its application during the O&M phase of the

    facility  for  prognostics  and  predicting  the  remaining

    useful life of facilities is still at its infancy, and further

    research is required (Toth et al., 2019; Kang et al., 2021;

    Congress  and  Puppala,  2021;  Liu  et  al.,  2022;  Nguyen

    et al., 2022).

     4.6    Asset lifecycle management

    The challenges with an asset management approach that

    spans  the  entire  lifecycle  are  integrating  data  from  the

    design and construction phase with the O&M phase and

    decision-making  in  consideration  of  lifecycle  perfor-

    mance. The need for an automated and unified data inte-

    gration system is evident. In this regard, DT, though an

    emerging  technology,  has  already  been  well-established

    as  a  solution  for  lifecycle  asset  management.  Neverthe-

    less, the full-scale application of DT in FM for asset life-

    cycle  management,  especially  during  the  O&M  phase,

    warrants further study. Simulation-based lifecycle perfor-

    mance prediction is also demanded to provide evidence in

    lifecycle  decision-making.  As  such,  DT  applications  in

    facility lifecycle management, along with the use of IoT

    technology for big data acquisition, data integration from

    construction to the O&M phase, and the use of ML algo-

    rithms for data analysis and utilization, could be further

    explored in future research (Ozturk, 2021).

     4.7    Semantic interoperability

    Smart buildings can be achieved through smart monitoring

    46

    Front. Eng. Manag. 2024, 11(1): 32–49

    and data integration of cyber–physical systems during the

    O&M phase. In this context, information integration and

    data-rich models have been the focus of research on DT

    in FM. Digital models provide a rich source of data on

    the  facility’s  components;  however,  in  current  practice,

    historical  O&M  data  must  be  manually  updated  in  the

    digital model. DT has the potential to address this limitation

    and facilitate data integration and exchange in real time

    for  smart  asset  management.  Furthermore,  knowledge

    modeling  can  aid  in  smart  monitoring  and  decision-

    making  through  its  capability  of  representing  domain

    knowledge.  However,  a  practical  solution  for  the

    exchange, data integration, and interoperability of seman-

    tically rich data from the as-built environment collected

    through  various  means  (e.g.,  photogrammetry  tools,

    sensors, and video cameras) and inspection reports to the

    virtual  model  for  informed  decision-making  in  FM  has

    yet to be realized. Knowledge modeling must be further

    explored in future research (Liu et al., 2020; Coupry et al.,

    2021).  In  addition,  several  most  important  factors  for

    smart FM during the O&M stage are anomaly detection,

    interoperability of semantically rich data, and prediction

    of the remaining useful life of assets through computerized

    technologies,  computation  modeling,  and  knowledge

    modeling (Lu et al., 2020b). Thus, future research in this

    area should focus on applying computerized maintenance

    management systems for DT in FM.

    In summary, as revealed by the in-depth discussion, the

    challenges  associated  with  DT  implementation  are  the

    seamless integration of the physical entities with the BIM

    model,  interoperability,  big  data  management,  and

    complexities with information utilization and integration

    throughout the facility lifecycle. Furthermore, the existing

    literature is mainly based on theoretical frameworks, and

    implementation-based  research  that  provides  practical

    insight is considerably lacking. AI-based predictive main-

    tenance  and  prognostics  play  a  crucial  role  in  efficient

    and cost-effective facility operation; however, it still has

    a  huge  gap  in  the  FM  industry.  In  this  regard,  and  to

    tackle this issue, BIM, IoT, predictive maintenance, AI,

    and asset management were found to be the most studied

    topics  in  the  research  area  of  DT  in  FM.  In  addition,

    results  from  this  research  indicate  that  digitalization  of

    the built assets, DL technology, and use of computational

    modeling  through  computerized  maintenance  manage-

    ment systems to simulate, visualize, analyze, and manage

    assets  throughout  their  lifecycle  for  smart  FM  were  the

    focuses of some research in 2021. In addition, the appli-

    cation of DT for prognostics and health management of

    facilities; creating fully automated and semantically rich

    DT of the existing infrastructural assets; interoperability

    of semantically rich data between BIM and FM; intelligent

    anomaly detection for smart maintenance; and DT appli-

    cations in facility lifecycle management, along with the

    use  of  big  data  collected  through  IoT  technologies  in

    combination  with  ML  algorithms  for  data  analysis  and

    utilization,  should  be  areas  of  focus  in  future  research.

    Moreover,  the  essential  components  of  automation  and

    smart FM, DL-based continuous improvement of the FM

    systems, AR/VR-based visualization for facility mainte-

    nance,  and  AI-based  real-time  asset  prognostics  and

    health management must be explored in the future.

     

    5    Conclusions

    This research provides a comprehensive landscape view

    of  DT-enabled  FM  and  addresses  the  state-of-the-art

    research patterns, challenges, and needs of DT research in

    the  FM  field  by  performing  a  bibliometric  analysis  of

    retrieved literature. The literature in the bibliometric anal-

    ysis  was  retrieved  from  two  major  scientific  databases

    (Scopus and WoS). VOSviewer was used to analyze the

    resulting  literature  quantitatively,  which  spanned  the

    period from January 2012 to March 2022. Network visu-

    alization mapping and analysis were used to study the co-

    occurrence of author keywords, citation networks, and co-

    authorship  to  identify  the  research  trends  and  the  most

    prominent  authors,  sources,  institutions,  countries,  and

    coauthor relationships.

    The  major  findings  show  that  1)  AI-based  predictive

    maintenance,  2)  real-time  cyber–physical  integration,

    3)  digital  FM,  4)  as-built/as-is  modeling,  5)  intelligent

    prognostics  and  health  management,  6)  asset  lifecycle

    management, and 7) semantic interoperability have been

    the principal focus areas of recent research on DT in FM.

    However,  AR-BIM  integration  for  FM,  AI-based  prog-

    nostics  of  the  facility  during  the  O&M  phase,  and  DT-

    based  intelligent  infrastructure  monitoring  must  be

    further studied to leverage DT in smart FM further. This

    study characterizes the current state-of-the-art and future

    needs with respect to research on the application of DT in

    FM, and in this regard, represents a notable contribution

    to the body of knowledge on digital transformation and

    smart approaches in FM. The presented review provides

    a  quantitative  overview  of  the  landscape  and  cannot

    provide a comprehensive, critical review of the identified

    articles. The future directions may not be comprehensive.

    A  critical  analysis  of  each  identified  article  could  be

    conducted  in  the  future  to  offer  a  systematic  in-depth

    insight into this emerging research area.

    Ovidiu Vermesan Joël Bacquet Preface Next Generation Internet of Things Distributed
    Intelligence at the Edge and Human Machine-to-Machine Cooperation The Internet
    of Things (IoT) and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) present opportunities
    for enterprises to improve efficiencies and enhance customer value. IoT/IIoT continues
    to evolve with new technologies and applications, embedding ubiquitous hyperconnectivity
    (5G and beyond), edge/fog computing, distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) and
    artificial intelligence (AI). IoT/IIoT operates in a continuum that connects the
    physical, digital, virtual and cyber worlds through intelligent ‘Digital Twins’
    by generating constant streams of data that can be harnessed into actionable distributed
    intelligence at the edge, with human, machine-to-machine cooperation to improve
    life, work and interaction with the everyday world. Next-generation Tactile IoT/IIoT
    builds a real-time interactive system between the human and the machine and introduces
    a new evolution in human-machine (H2M) communication. Tactile IoT/IIoT enables
    the transfer of physical ‘senses’ (e.g. sense/touch, actuation, hepatic actions,
    etc.) in real-time form remotely and introduces a new paradigm shift to the skill-based/knowledge-based
    networks instead of content-based networks. New solutions are needed for addressing
    IoT distributed end-to-end security because there are many more IoT/IIoT devices
    to secure, compared with traditional IT infrastructure devices. Many IoT/IIoT
    devices are embedded into systems that can affect physical health and safety,
    in addition to traditional communications or computing systems, and they introduce
    a complex management environment, with diverse technology profiles, processing
    capabilities, use-cases, and physical locations. The chapters in the book present
    and discuss the next-generation IoT/IIoT research and innovation trends by addressing
    the enabling technologies, such as network technologies, edge/fog computing, distributed
    ledger technologies, AI, and the challenges for security, network management and
    integration for future IoT applications across industrial sectors. The IoT/IIoT
    development ahead implies a human-centric approach that involves a judicious and
    dynamic balancing of collaboration and competition in IoT ecosystems in a common
    quest for advancing the digital transformation of industry and economy for the
    benefit of society and citizens. Editors Biography Dr. Ovidiu Vermesan holds a

    State of Play and Future Perspectives Mechthild Rohen European Commission, Belgium
    1.1 Introduction Two years have passed since the publication of our Digitising
    European Industry (DEI) strategy, whose overall objective is to ensure that any
    industry in Europe, big or small, wherever situated and in any sector can fully
    benefit from digital innovations to upgrade its products, improve its processes
    and adapt its business models to the digital transformation. The underlying scenario
    is represented by the European platform of national initiatives on DEI, including
    digital innovation hubs, regulatory framework, skills and jobs, partnership and
    platforms (Figure 1.1). Figure 1.1 DEI 4 main actions. IoT is at the heart of
    the digitisation process of the economy and society and it is an essential building
    block of the DEI strategy and the Digital Single Market strategy. Therefore, the
    overall goal is for Europe to be at the forefront of supplying innovative IoT
    solutions and to become the world’s leading market for IoT products and services.
    As part of the DEI strategy, the goal for developing IoT leadership encompasses
    several building blocks funded under Horizon 2020: The IoT-European Platforms
    Initiative (IoT-EPI), addressing interoperability of IoT platforms, creating the
    ecosystem, using architectures, and integrating systems and networks for a multiplicity
    of novel applications; The Focus Area on IoT under Crosscutting Activities in
    the Horizon 2020 Work Programme 2016–2017, on experimentation with real-life solutions,
    tested at large scale with users; and The Focus Area on Digitising and transforming
    European industry and services under the Horizon 2020 Work Programme 2018–2020,
    which supports the DEI strategy on digitization of industrial sectors, integrating
    digital technologies and innovation across societal challenges (Figure 1.2). Figure
    1.2 Overall EU IoT strategy. These building blocks are further elaborated below
    to provide with an overview of the state of play of the EU initiatives and activities.
    1.2 Research and Innovation under Horizon 2020 The IoT-European Platforms Initiative
    (IoT-EPI) was formed to build a vibrant and sustainable IoT-ecosystem in Europe,
    maximising the opportunities for open platform development, interoperability and
    information sharing. At the core of the programme there are seven research and
    innovation projects and two coordination and support actions: Inter-IoT, BIG IoT,
    AGILE, SymbIoTe, TagItSmart, Vicinity, bIoTope, Be-IoT and UNIFY-IoT. With a total
    funding of EUR 50 million and a partner network of 120 organizations, these projects
    develop innovative solutions focusing on IoT architectures and semantic interoperability.
    Furthermore, they also foster technology adoption through the development of use
    cases in several industrial sectors, and community and business building activities.
    All projects ran within the time-frame of 2016–2018 – with one (Vicinity) extending
    until 2019. The IoT-EPI projects are cooperating to define the research and innovation
    mechanisms and to identify opportunities for collaboration in IoT ecosystems to
    maximise the opportunities for common approaches to platform development, interoperability
    and information sharing. The common activities are organised under six task forces
    that are conceived and developed under IoT-EPI (Figure 1.3). Figure 1.3 IoT-EPI
    Task Forces. Each of the six Task Forces have produced major results in terms
    of research, but also in terms of policy, which has created a real impact on the
    European IoT market [1]. Some of the key results include: The analysis of IoT
    platforms showing a market growing rapidly, but still fragmented, with hundreds
    of different and incompatible platforms. This report on IoT landscape has been
    further developed and published by the Alliance for Internet of Things Innovation
    (AIOTI) [2]; The publication of a white paper on IoT platform interoperability,
    compiling the lessons learnt and results from the seven projects [4]; The development
    of an open architecture and open IoT business model framework that has set the
    foundation of cooperation with the developers and entrepreneurs community, and
    that has mobilised SMEs and start-ups to join the ecosystem. In eleven open calls,
    with more than 100 external IoT-teams, the IoT-EPI has planned an investment of
    more than EUR 5.5 million until December 2018 to nurture an IoT ecosystem around
    the seven core projects; The development of policy recommendations for the uptake
    of IoT in Europe; and The set-up of an education platform using the results of
    the IoT-EPI projects. Besides the IoT-EPI Task Forces, adequate security, trust
    and privacy are key issues to be tackled in connection with IoT, and therefore
    a specific cluster of project addressing these issues has been launched under
    Horizon 2020 in 2017. Seven projects have been selected with a total EU contribution
    of EUR 37 million in order to develop and test solutions providing IoT security,
    trust and privacy (ENACT, IoTCrawler, SecureIoT, BRAIN-IoT, SOFIE, CHARIOT, SEMIoTICS,
    SerIoT). The projects address the key issues of end-to-end security and trust
    in open IoT Platforms, as well as advanced concepts for IoT security and prevention
    of cyber-attacks, including blockchains and distributed ledger technology, which
    are tested in a set of ambitious use cases. In addition, the projects deploy open
    IoT platforms and include a strong contribution to upcoming open standards in
    IoT security. 1.3 Deployment – IoT Focus Area and Focus Area on Digitization In
    order to foster the uptake of IoT in Europe and to enable the emergence of IoT
    ecosystems supported by open technologies, the European Commission launched an
    IoT Focus Area that supports the IoT European Large-Scale Pilots Programme (IoT-LSPs)
    on deployment of IoT at large in Europe. These IoT-LSPs started on 1 January 2017
    and are funded with a budget of EUR 100 million. The IoT-LSPs cover the following
    domains: Smart living environments for ageing well (ACTIVAGE); Smart Farming and
    Food Security (IoF2020); Wearables for smart ecosystems (MONICA); Reference zones
    in EU cities (SYNCHRONICITY); and Autonomous vehicles in a connected environment
    (AUTOPILOT). With these pilots, the European Commission is supporting the testing
    and experimentation of new IoT related technologies with the involvement of and
    result validation by end users. These pilots are expected to accelerate the standards
    setting across different business sectors, boosting further the IoT technology
    and provide input to policy developments, such as data protection, privacy and
    security. Since January 2017, several successful results have been achieved. Each
    funded project is applying IoT approaches to specific real-life challenges across
    use cases, based on European relevance, technology readiness and socio-economic
    interest in Europe. More than 50 use cases have taken shape and are now fully
    running. This has also allowed the LSPs to work together in order to define common
    high-level architecture models. Another example is the well-defined and good cooperation
    among LSPs, which develop common mechanisms for the publication of open calls
    to enlarge their consortia with new partners, in particular SMEs. These open calls
    provide so-called cascading funds as financial support targeted to involve especially
    SMEs and start-ups to get access to pilot testing in an open and lean way. In
    the Horizon 2020 Work Programme 2018–2020, the European Commission aims to use
    the strong concept of a Focus Area on Digitisation (Digitising and transforming
    European industry and services), accounting for EUR 250 million funding and forming
    a significant part of ICT calls in the Horizon 2020 Work Programme 2018–2020.
    Success in implementation of the Focus Area will depend to a large extent on the
    capacity to work across the digital, societal and industrial topics that are grouped
    under this Focus Area. The Focus Area requires close cooperation of different
    services across different DGs, namely CONNECT, GROW, RTD, AGRI and ENER, to ensure
    coherent policy setting across areas which so far were siloed economic and policy
    areas, e.g. to support Digitisation under the Energy Union or the Common Agriculture
    Policy. Calls will close in November 2018 and resulting from this Focus Area,
    a further set of pilots will be launched in 2019 across different areas, such
    as health and care, energy efficiency, agriculture and industry 4.0. These pilots
    will accelerate standards setting across different business sectors, boosting
    further the investments and scalable market creation for IoT technology. This
    focus area will be funded by several parts of the Horizon 2020 programme, mainly
    by the Leadership in Enabling and Industrial Technologies and Societal Challenges
    pillars. Pilot activities will be supported in the areas of Smart Farming, Digitisation
    of Energy, Digital Health and Rural Platforms, as depicted in Figure 1.4. Figure
    1.4 Focus Area on Digitization. 1.4 IoT within the Next Generation Internet –
    Preparing the Next Framework Programme for Research and Innovation IoT continues
    to evolve rapidly, in particular in response to the major trends, such as the
    ever-increasing volumes of data generated and extraction of knowledge through
    smart data analytics, as well as increasing levels of automation and decision
    making, made possible by smart sensors, devices and actuators combined with machine
    learning and artificial intelligence. In addition, there are new real-time requirements
    emerging, such as in industrial production and autonomous cars, which must be
    addressed. The capacity of communication networks is ever increasing with 5G deployment
    starting and processing power is still increasing exponentially, allowing for
    new distributed architectures (e.g. cognitive cloud, fog or edge computing) and
    solutions. Also, new approaches to reduce or eliminate intermediaries, by building
    on blockchains and distributed ledgers, and the power to control access to and
    sharing of data, lead to new value chains and business models, which will open
    new opportunities for European companies and user communities. This is all encapsulated
    in the vision of a Next Generation Internet, which is more human-centric in terms
    of identity, data protection and privacy, control and opportunity, addressing
    wider needs (from browsing to interconnection of billions of smart devices with
    new real-time requirements) and which is more secure and trusted by design as
    a critical infrastructure for society and business. 1.5 Conclusion The digital
    revolution has only just started – and it is speeding up. Technology is entering
    into a critical phase, where connectivity and intelligence will permeate all areas
    of the physical world, with profound economic and social effects. Europe must
    maintain a leading position in the digital world and ensure that everyone whether
    businesses, public sector and citizens, can benefit from it. The European Commission
    has just published its proposal for the next EU budget for 2021–2027 [5], where
    there is a substantial focus on an ambitious investment in digital to make this
    a reality. This proposal includes a 60% increase in budget for Horizon Europe,
    the next EU Framework Programme for Research and innovation, as well as a proposed
    new programme, i.e. the Digital Europe Programme with a EUR 9 billion funding
    to support the large scale uptake of digital technologies, including digital skills.
    IoT and its future evolution is central to many of these efforts and Europe can
    take the lead in realising its potential. References Digital Single Market – The

    2. Future Trends in IoT Joël Bacquet, Rolf Riemenschneider and Peter Wintlev-Jensen
    European Commission, Belgium 2.1 Introduction The Next Generation Internet (NGI)
    initiative [1] aims at maintaining the European lead in advanced network infrastructures
    and fully exploit the opportunities offered by the connection to the physical
    work i.e the Internet of Things (IoT), powered by advanced computing capabilities
    and data infrastructure. The NGI and its link to IoT has to be at the service
    of people, industry and society, addressing present and specific societal challenges,
    combined with artificial intelligence (AI), secure transactions, sovereignty,
    edge computing, interactive technologies and social media, as depicted in Figure
    2.1. Every technological design has to focus on making data and components easy
    to use and profitable in an open and democratic way to every single user. Figure
    2.1 NGI Key Pillars. IoT technologies and applications bring fundamental changes
    in individuals’ and society’s view of how technology and business work in the
    world, and it is therefore an essential element of the Next Generation Internet.
    IoT is seen today as a disruptive technology for enabling new opportunities and
    triggering new services and applications. However, collecting massive amounts
    of data in everyday life poses huge challenges for the user to keep control of
    his data in terms of managing access, sharing and protection. Additionally, one
    of Europe’s greatest challenges is to keep the sovereignty of the underlying core
    infrastructure that computes and stores sensitive information, and protect IoT
    devices from misuse. The societal potential of IoT is extraordinary: better use
    of natural resources through smart farming, better food quality through devices
    enabling food traceability and control, better human health through devices linked
    to remote medicine and independent living, lower carbon emissions from autonomous
    driving and smart logistics, fewer accidents relying on connected driving, smart
    cities through smart use of massive data generated from a multitude of new sensors
    in a city. The scope of this chapter is to review novel IoT concepts that have
    been gathered from groups of experts in different fora, including specific workshops
    organised by the European Commission, inputs the European Research Cluster on
    the Internet of Things (IERC), the Alliance for Internet of Things Innovation
    (AIOTI) and the IoT-European Platforms Initiative (IoT-EPI) cluster. 2.2 Key Technological
    Game Changers for IoT Novel IoT architecture, platforms and solutions will emerge
    and will integrate new enabling technologies such as AI, secure Distributed Ledger
    Technologies (DLTs), or advanced communication networks, in order to meet new
    user requirements for performance, quality of services, trust and user control
    data. These IoT architectures, platforms and solutions will rely on the following
    game changers: Next generation IoT devices; Edge computing; Data-centric architectures;
    Community-driven business models; and A resilient and reliable infrastructure.
    Towards Next Generation IoT devices. The IoT platform development will move in
    the next phase with the emergence of tactile interface based on human-centric
    sensing and actuating, augmented and virtual reality combined with new IoT end-point
    capabilities capturing contextual environment. Interactive and conversational
    IoT platforms will emerge with innovative user interfaces interfering with things
    and humans. These interactive platforms will enable real-time control, physical
    (haptic) experiences, interactive, context aware, event-driven IoT services with
    more intelligence at the edge. In supporting trust and security, information flows
    stay close to the user, decisions are taken at the point of interest, where data
    is collected and locally processed. For this to happen, the applications need
    to combine edge computing, IoT and mobile autonomous systems using AI technologies
    as functionality enablers. Towards edge computing, shifting computing and data
    processing close to the source of data. The usual approach in most current IoT
    solutions is to execute data crunching in the cloud. In many scenarios this is
    the most suitable approach due to distributed nature of data collection. However,
    the value generated by many IoT devices decreases over time (e.g. for a thermostat
    control). With billions of IoT devices, it does not make sense to store all data
    in the cloud, but to limit data transfer to the cloud and store only information
    that is necessary to avoid data deluge. There are scenarios in which significant
    amount of data is collected at one location and the output of that local data
    processing is used to control a local process. In such cases, edge processing
    approach is desirable over processing in the cloud. For instance, this approach
    will require more computational capacity at device and gateway level to meet real-time
    requirements, preserve privacy and reduce the attack surface towards IoT devices
    by keeping most sensitive data local. This approach will imply a disruption from
    the vertical silo approach promoted by current commercial solutions, where all
    data are captured in cloud repositories and then fed back to the user. One of
    the most pertinent research tracks for edge computing will be to set the confidence
    level from information gathered from a cloud server, aggregated data from federated
    clouds and/or information retrieved from the internet. In the times of fake news,
    whilst experiencing novel possibilities of aggregating and manipulating data using
    AI, it poses unprecedented challenges for users and connected systems to set the
    appropriate confidence or criticality level of any external information. It remains
    a challenge for any future AI systems to make transparent how knowledge has been
    elicited that relies on trusted sources and algorithms. In contrast, edge computing
    novel architecture should support more decentralized decision and action support
    system available directly at the device level. In addition, edge computing solutions
    can create partial views on an environment to facilitate the decision-making process,
    perform data pruning, processing, anonymization, etc. Towards data-centric architectures,
    dealing with the exploding volume of data generated across the different application
    fields and relying on AI techniques for pre-processing of data. Data storage and
    data flow will stress capabilities of the IoT platforms, mainly due to the large
    number of devices and objects, with the need of storing, processing and exchanging
    large amount of data in due time. Data storage is directly linked with security
    and privacy components, and data markets, including the availability for the regular
    citizen and not only corporations and stakeholders, other than with Data Sovereignty
    (subject to the laws of the country in which data is retrieved and located). The
    application of AI (mainly machine learning) across the whole IoT pipeline will
    have its roots in the cloud but will have to be deployed at the edge level, embedded
    in the things or the gateways to meet time constraints. An IoT data centre like
    the IBM Watson will be capable of re/defining experience and learning, detecting
    recurring patterns and systematic failures, in particular it will be able to adapt
    a holistic risk assessment of a system state in a complex environment. As said,
    critical functions have to be replicated and delegated to a local agent that ensures
    the functioning of a system even if it is oﬄine. On the application/services side,
    AI-powered digital agents can act on behalf of the end users, interact with the
    most appropriate sensors and access the data related to the users’ current activities.
    Up to an extent, these agents can act autonomously and proactively, for a seamless
    bridging of the real and digital world. Real-time intelligence provided by such
    lightweight agents would enable smart devices to have better understanding of
    their surroundings, the user’s conditions and allow them to behave accordingly.
    Towards community-driven business models ensuring security and privacy, building
    on DLTs. Novel business models and services increasingly built on social networks
    that are associated with daily life needs like mobility, shopping or home care,
    might be linked to a building, a quartier or city. We have seen success stories
    in the economy, like Uber, Airbnb or eBay, that have grown exponentially and that
    build on the fundamentals of a sharing economy. These peer-to-peer (P2P) marketplaces
    are driven by common interest and shared values. In order to secure and enable
    growth of those P2P platforms, scale and secure technologies for authentication,
    authorization and accounting must evolve from isolated platforms to an ecosystem
    of connected platforms. DLT enables autonomy and ultimately, secures machine-to-machine
    (M2M) transactions without a central platform provider. Also, DLT can be a solution
    to manage the certificates for access to information from objects, including personal
    data, as well as smart contracts enabling new business models for P2P platform
    services. Things like money, loyalty points, intellectual property, certificates
    or even identity, can be sent across the globe, safely, (almost) instantly and
    without the need for a middle man/intermediary. Security and privacy mechanisms,
    based on blockchains or any other DLT, may provide new benefits and possibilities
    to the individual users to effectively and securely manage their personal data
    space, like authenticating the origin of the data and allowing the use of the
    data for specific stakeholders and applications, allowing the control of the re-selling
    of the data. The creation of micro-contracts and using cryptocurrencies may support
    the final benefit or revenues to the users. Traditional industrial sectors like
    energy, transport, or food chains may be transformed through P2P platform services,
    with an impact detrimental to today’s business models. It remains a challenge
    and obligation not to ignore but to embrace P2P platforms that contribute to the
    growth of a community and demonstrate the opportunities of emerging technologies
    like DLT or blockchains for IoT platforms. DLT holds promise to mediate interactions
    in future decentralized IoT environments, but next-generation DLT solutions are
    needed to make this a reality. Current distributed ledgers seem not to be scalable
    and had difficulties to handle a high transaction load. Towards resilient and
    reliable infrastructure. Future IoT services and applications will require infrastructures
    to support IoT device connectivity, data streaming and security with new requirements
    for service quality and reliability. Decentralized data governance and data security
    will be possible thanks to distributed architectures using DLT, where the control
    of personal data is significantly improved. But a trusted DLT platform will require
    beyond a protocol scalable, performant infrastructure and shared governance to
    establish trust and security. Another challenge for the infrastructure will be
    the treatment of IoT traffic which will be a major research and deployment issue,
    to increase availability, resilience and use of data coming from IoT. The emerging
    trends are related to distributed architectures, software defined technologies
    and new networking capabilities. 2.3 Interoperability IoT environments are rather
    complex with heterogeneous physical devices supporting various communication protocols,
    while they are possibly connected to an intermediary gateway and then to their
    virtual representations (i.e. services) running on different platforms. Thus,
    it is possible to interact with a single IoT device in many ways using its varied
    interfaces and representations. IoT platforms require interoperability on multiple
    levels, which means finding the characteristic functionalities of each layer and
    defining meta-protocols that can be mapped on the ones used in the platforms (i.e.
    on the level of syntactic interoperability, the characteristic functionality is
    resource access). A lot of work has been done in this field in particular in the
    IoT-EPI, which focuses mainly on architectures and semantic interoperability [2].
    As an example, the INTER-IoT project [3] has defined an IoT multi-layer approach
    to provide semantic interoperability, as illustrated in Figure 2.2. Figure 2.2
    Inter-IoT Multi-layer architecture. Nevertheless, research on a layer-oriented
    approach is still needed to address tighter interoperability at all layers of
    IoT systems (device, network, middleware, application, data and semantics) with
    a strong focus on guaranteeing trust, privacy and security aspects within this
    interoperability. The demands of the future internet, including future IoT applications
    and services, will require a much larger object space, resource efficient implementation
    in devices, object interaction across so far siloed application spaces, as well
    as support for intelligent and trusted mechanisms for service provision. Standards
    have to support interoperability for any object to be seamlessly connected. New
    connected objects allow users to optimize functions in their daily life (to be
    safe, for entertainment and comfort, or daily activity support). This requires
    that objects seamlessly and securely connect, but that they are also identified
    due to their functionality. On semantic interoperability, despite several efforts
    to find common ontologies to be reused and different standardization efforts (e.g.
    SAREF, W3C or ETSI), in a real interoperability environment, new ontologies have
    to be defined, to address specific deployment. Efforts have to be devoted to semantic
    translation or alignment in order to provide an easy support for ontology matching
    between IoT platforms. Work needs to continue on common vocabularies, data models
    and semantic mapping techniques that could become the key technologies for semantic
    interoperability via common efforts on the abstract core model for IoT domains.
    Under the new Focus Area on Digitisation in the Horizon 2020 Work Programme 2018–2020,
    the European Commission calls for a pilot on Interoperable Smart Homes and Grids
    under call DT-ICT-10-2018-19. IoT is expected to enable a seamless integration
    of home appliances with related home comfort and building automation services
    allowing to match user needs with the management of distributed energy across
    the grid. Through Digitisation of Energy, there will be much more assets connected
    to the grid, which are intelligently communicating with the grid. This comes with
    all kinds of complexities in terms of interoperability, but mainly due to a lot
    of different IoT platforms coming from different manufacturers and sectors, like
    building automation, heating, electrical vehicle charging, appliances, etc. The
    energy sectoral ecosystem finds itself in a transition period that entails the
    grid operator, the energy business and services, and the changing role of a consumer
    or prosumer. The interconnectivity of different systems and assets will become
    very powerful through IoT platforms if interoperability can be achieved across
    federated systems that enable the integration of data and novel services. 2.4
    Boosting IoT Innovation and Deployment In future IoT solutions, the importance
    of data will prevail and further grow. Measuring the economic value of data is
    a key challenge, focusing on the understanding of the economic value of the data
    instances and streams in different IoT infrastructure deployment use-cases. The
    openness of localized sensor data will provide new means to boost the IoT market.
    Providers of such data will experience new revenue streams. Moreover, new form
    of marketplaces will be created; that of local data marketplaces, which will also
    boost innovation. Especially when considering use cases like smart cities, smart
    transportation or smart grids, where sensing information is characterized by lot
    of heterogeneous and sensitive data sources, the real benefit from such kind of
    data markets is seized when data is shared across private, public and industrial
    value chains. Apart from technology enablers for data marketplaces like DLT, the
    European Commission favours communities and ecosystems that provide incentives
    for sharing data on any kind of assets or resources to create an added value through
    new services and applications (e.g. shared parking, car-sharing, P2P energy, etc.).
    It remains a challenge for public decision makers to adapt the regulatory framework
    for new data economy towards a Free Flow of Data, harmonization of data access
    across borders, data protection and portability in support of a Digital Single
    Market. The IoT platform centric point of view will evolve to an ecosystem of
    platforms with IoT platforms, IoT nodes and sets of IoT things. Instead of IoT
    platform companies trying to lock-in their customers through closed system approaches,
    thus creating complex integration links, new common and open interoperation among
    all these structures will be needed. Ecosystem governance is necessary for controlling
    different degrees of interoperation and for managing the access to data and services
    across the whole ecosystem, especially for the use of personal data. 2.5 Conclusion
    IoT is a key technology transversal to all sectors of activity and will be fundamental
    for the NGI initiative. The next generation of IoT will build on a new generation
    set of devices and systems that will make use of new infrastructure enhancements,
    better sensing and actuating capabilities, end-to-end semantic knowledge, more
    powerful computation capabilities on the edge, intrinsic adoption of AI from the
    edge to the backbone, and the ability to set-up new relationships (like smart
    contracts, context awareness or intelligent behaviour) among things, services
    and people, while respecting the human-centric concerns in terms of privacy, security,
    openness, sustainability and control of personal data. The inputs collected from
    the relevant workshops and IoT stakeholder communities are key inspiring sources
    on the strategic directions needed to support future research, development and
    innovation of IoT in the context of the NGI initiative. These sources are major
    inputs to the elaboration of future research and innovation work programmes within
    Horizon 2020 and beyond. References The Next Generation Internet initiative, online

    Internet of Things (IoT) and the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) are evolving
    towards the next generation of Tactile IoT/IIoT, which will bring together hyperconnectivity,
    edge computing, Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) and Artificial Intelligence
    (AI). Future IoT applications will apply AI methods, such as machine learning
    (ML) and neural networks (NNs), to optimize the processing of information, as
    well as to integrate robotic devices, drones, autonomous vehicles, augmented and
    virtual reality (AR/VR), and digital assistants. These applications will engender
    new products, services and experiences that will offer many benefits to businesses,
    consumers and industries. A more human-centred perspective will allow us to maximise
    the effects of the next generation of IoT/IIoT technologies and applications as
    we move towards the integration of intelligent objects with social capabilities
    that need to address the interactions between autonomous systems and humans in
    a seamless way. 3.1 Next Generation Internet of Things The IoT is enabled by heterogeneous
    technologies used to sense, collect, store, act, process, infer, transmit, create
    notifications of/for, manage and analyse data. The combination of emergent technologies
    for information processing and distributed security, e.g. AI, IoT, DLTs and blockchains,
    brings new challenges in addressing distributed IoT architectures and distributed
    security mechanisms that form the foundation of improved and, eventually, entirely
    new products and services. New systems in the IoT that use smart solutions with
    embedded intelligence, connectivity and processing capabilities for edge devices
    rely on real-time analysis of information at the edge. These new IoT systems are
    moving away from centralized cloud-computing solutions towards distributed intelligent
    edge computing systems. Traditional centralized cloud computing solutions are
    perfect for non-real-time applications that require high data rates, huge amounts
    of storage and processing power, are not strict to very low latency, cost money
    and can be used for heavy data analytics and AI processing jobs. On the other
    hand, distributed edge solutions introduce computations at the edge of the network
    where information is generated and are perfect for real-time services, since they
    exhibit very low latency (in the order of milliseconds) and can be used for simple
    ultra-fast analytics jobs. The collection, storage and processing of data at the
    edge of the network in a distributed way contributes also to the increased privacy
    of the user data, since no personal information is stored in backbone centralized
    servers and each user retains the full control of his data. Figure 3.1 Next Generation
    IoT Hyperconnected: 6As and 6Cs. IoT developments during recent years have been
    characterized by attributes that can be “labelled” the 6As: Anything (any device),
    to be transferred from/to Anyone (anybody), located Any place (anywhere), at Any
    time (any context), using the most appropriate physical path from Any path (any
    network) available between the sender and the recipient based on performance and/or
    economic considerations, to provide Any service (any business). The IoT paradigm
    is evolving and entire IoT ecosystems are now built upon innervation elements
    known as the 6Cs: Collect (heterogeneity of devices of various complexities and
    intelligence, that enhance the real-time collection of data generated from the
    connections of devices and information), Connect (ubiquitous distributed connections
    of heterogeneous devices and information, where the connections are the foundational
    component of the IoT), Cache (stored information in the distributed IoT computing/processing
    environment), Compute (advanced processing and computation of data and information),
    Cognize (information analytics, insights, extractions, real-time AI processing
    and Create (the creation of new interactions, services, experiences, business
    models and solutions). This is illustrated in Figure 3.1. Figure 3.2 Next Generation
    IoT evolution. The IoT transforms everyday physical objects in the surrounding
    environment into ecosystems of information that enrich people’s lives [97]. The
    IoT not only influences the future Internet landscape, with implications for security
    and privacy (personal freedoms), but it could also help to reduce the digital
    divide. The increased dependence of AI and the IoT on the connectivity network,
    together with the severity of security challenges, increases their vulnerabilities
    in parallel. The ongoing and future success of the Internet as a driver for economic
    and social innovation is linked to how new technologies will respond to these
    threats. Combining AI with the IoT promises new opportunities, ranging from new
    services and breakthroughs in science to the augmentation of human intelligence
    and its convergence with the physical and digital world. The next generation of
    IoT-combining technologies as presented in Figure 3.3, such as AI, DLTs, hyperconnectivity,
    distributed edge computing, end-to-end distributed security and autonomous systems
    – robotics will require increased human-centred safeguards and prioritised ethical
    considerations in their design and deployment. Next generation IoT evolution is
    illustrated in Figure 3.2. The IoT is bridging the gap between the virtual, digital
    and physical worlds by bringing together people, processes, data and things while
    generating knowledge through IoT applications and platforms. IoT achieves this
    addressing security, privacy and trust issues across these dimensions in an era
    where technology, computing power, connectivity, network capacity and the number
    and types of smart devices are all expected to increase. In this context, IoT
    is driving the digital transformation. Figure 3.3 Next Generation IoT technology
    convergence. As a global concept, the IoT requires a common high-level definition.
    The IoT is a paradigm involving multidisciplinary activities and has different
    meanings at different levels of abstraction through the information and knowledge
    value chain. Considering the wide background and the number of required technologies,
    from sensing devices, communication subsystems, data aggregation and pre-processing
    to object instantiation and finally service provision, proposing an unambiguous
    definition of the “IoT” is non-trivial. IoT is defined [60] as a dynamic global
    network infrastructure with self-configuring capabilities based on standard and
    interoperable communication protocols where physical and virtual ‘things’ have
    identities, physical attributes, and virtual personalities using intelligent interfaces
    for seamlessly integrating into the information network. In the IoT, ‘things’
    are expected to become active participants in business, information and social
    processes where they are enabled to interact and communicate among themselves
    and with the environment by exchanging data and information ‘sensed’ about the
    environment, while reacting autonomously to the ‘real/physical world’ events and
    influencing it by running processes that trigger actions and create services with
    or without direct human intervention. Interfaces in the form of services facilitate
    interactions with these ‘smart things’ over the Internet, query and change their
    state and any information associated with them, considering security and privacy
    issues. In the context of industry digitisation, IoT/IIoT brings together the
    primary characteristics of Next Generation Internet (NGI) technology, mobile systems
    and ubiquitous connectivity with those of industrial control systems, sensing,
    actuating and control capabilities. Interoperability, platform integration and
    standardisation are essential for digitising industry applications. IoT/IIoT and
    industrial control systems have three quality dimensions – integrity, availability
    and confidentiality – which are essential for implementing applications in industrial
    vertical domains and across different vertical domains. Whereas the IoT emerged
    as an add-on to the already existing Internet, it is important to consider the
    emergence of an NGI where the IoT is deeply embedded and no longer a mere add-on.
    IoT devices and systems that build on enhanced sensing/actuating, reasoning capabilities
    and computational power at the edge are already becoming a natural part of an
    integrated NGI rather than simple extensions of the Internet. The IoT is promising
    in a hyperconnected world, where every object has the capability to sense its
    surrounding environment, transmit information, provide feedback or trigger an
    action through the application of AI processes in a distributed architecture with
    processing, intelligence and connectivity at the edge. It is becoming increasingly
    clear that the main benefit of IoT systems is the network effect, i.e., when different
    systems are integrated. As many different systems become integrated, the IoT must
    face complex interoperability challenges before it can create real cross-domain
    services with seamless movements of devices and data. However, a lack of stable
    implementations and the variety of devices available undermine the promised interoperability.
    A standard solution for IoT interoperability could result in several implementations
    whose effectiveness would need to be verified and certified; current practices
    for interoperability testing require different vendors, developers and service
    providers to participate in physical events. The integration of hyperconnectivity,
    IoT/IIoT, AI, DLTs and edge computing requires the NGI to address these challenges.
    This implies the identification of the right business models and the proper governance
    framework, which support data movement across systems and identify liability in
    case of any issues, as well as an understanding of the means to overcome the current
    technical fragmentation in the IoT. In many applications, the centralised services
    of cloud computing are being replaced with IoT edge-distributed solutions based
    on AI methods. With multi-access edge computing (MEC) and ubiquitous hyperconnectivity
    capabilities (5G and beyond), the IoT is now able to process large amounts of
    information, resulting from its connections, to be used for intelligent purposes
    by advanced AI algorithms, which can learn with less data and require fewer processing
    and memory resources. The cognitive transformation of IoT applications also allows
    the use of optimised solutions for individual applications and the integration
    of immersive technologies, i.e., virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR).
    Such concepts transform the way individuals and robots interact with one another
    and with IoT platform systems. 3.2 Next Generation IoT Strategic Research and
    Innovation The Internet of Things European Research Cluster (IERC) concentrates
    the know-how regarding scientific production and research capacity for the Internet
    of Things in Europe; the IERC brings together EU-funded projects with the aim
    of defining a common vision for IoT technology and addressing European research
    challenges. The rationale is to leverage the large potential for IoT-based capabilities
    and promote the use of the results of existing projects to encourage the convergence
    of ongoing work; ultimately, the endpoints are to tackle the most important deployment
    issues, transfer research and knowledge to products and services, and apply these
    to real IoT applications. The objectives of IERC are to provide information on
    research and innovation trends, and to present the state of the art in terms of
    IoT technology and societal analysis, to apply developments to IoT-funded projects
    and to market applications and EU policies. The final goal is to test and develop
    innovative and interoperable IoT solutions in areas of industrial and public interest.
    The IERC objectives are addressed as an IoT continuum of research, innovation,
    development, deployment, and adoption. Every year, the IERC launches its Strategic
    Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA), which is the outcome of discussions involving
    project representatives/coordinators, a collective group of experts from different
    stakeholders representing the different domains where IoT is relevant and industry
    representation that is not necessarily limited to IERC community participation.
    Such industry participation includes the Alliance for the Internet of Things Innovation
    (AIOTI), an industry-lead association representing the industrial European and
    non-European members. Enabled by the activities of the IERC, IoT is bridging physical,
    digital, virtual, and human spheres through networks, connected processes, and
    data, and turning them into knowledge and action, so that everything is connected
    in a large, distributed network. New technological trends bring intelligence and
    cognition to IoT technologies, protocols, standards, architecture, data acquisition,
    and analysis, all with a societal, industrial, business, and/or human purpose
    in mind. The IoT technological trends are presented in the context of integration
    of hyperconnectivity, digital transformation, actionable data, information and
    knowledge. The IERC works to provide a framework that supports the convergence
    of IoT architecture approaches; it will do so while considering the vertical definition
    of the architectural layers, end-to-end security, and horizontal interoperability.
    The SRIA is developed with the support of a European-led community of interrelated
    projects and their stakeholders, all of whom are dedicated to the innovation,
    creation, development, and use of IoT technology. Since the release of the first
    version of the SRIA, we have witnessed active research on several IoT topics.
    Updated releases of this SRIA build incrementally on previous versions [60, 62,
    88] and highlight the main research topics associated with the development of
    IoT-enabling technologies, infrastructure, and applications [87]. The research
    activities include the IoT European Platforms Initiative (IoT-EPI) program that
    includes the research and innovation consortia that are working together to deliver
    an IoT extended into a web of platforms for connected devices and objects. The
    platforms support smart environments, businesses, services and persons with dynamic
    and adaptive configuration capabilities. The goal is to overcome the fragmentation
    of vertically-oriented closed systems, architectures and application areas and
    move towards open systems and platforms that support multiple applications. IoT-EPI
    is funded by the European Commission (EC) with EUR 50 million over three years
    (2016–2018) [67]. The research and innovation items addressed and discussed in
    the task forces of the IoT-EPI program, the IERC activity chains, and the AIOTI
    working groups form the basis of the IERC SRIA to address the roadmap of IoT technologies
    and applications; this is done in line with the major economic and societal challenges
    underscored by the EU 2020 Digital Agenda [87]. The IoT European Large-Scale Pilots
    Programme [68] includes the innovation consortia that are collaborating to foster
    the deployment of IoT solutions in Europe through integration of advanced IoT
    technologies across the value chain, demonstration of multiple IoT applications
    at scale and in a usage context, and as close as possible to operational conditions.
    The programme projects are targeted and goal driven initiatives that propose IoT
    approaches to specific real-life industrial/societal challenges. They are autonomous
    entities that involve stakeholders from supply side to demand side, and contain
    all the technological and innovation elements, the tasks related to the use, application
    and deployment as well as the development, testing and integration activities.
    The scope of IoT European Large-Scale Pilots Programme is to foster the deployment
    of IoT solutions in Europe through integration of advanced IoT technologies across
    the value chain, demonstration of multiple IoT applications at scale and in a
    usage context, and as close as possible to operational conditions. Specific Pilot
    considerations include: Mapping of pilot architecture approaches with validated
    IoT reference architectures such as IoT-A enabling interoperability across use
    cases. Contribution to strategic activity groups that were defined during the
    LSP kick-off meeting to foster coherent implementation of the different LSPs.
    Contribution to clustering their results of horizontal nature (interoperability
    approach, standards, security and privacy approaches, business validation and
    sustainability, methodologies, metrics, etc.). The IoT European Large-Scale Pilots
    Programme includes projects promoting the IoT innovation by means of market applications
    based on services’ demand and impact in the European market, technology readiness
    and socioeconomic interests in European society. The IoT European Large-Scale
    Pilots Programme is funded by the European Commission (EC) with EUR 100 million
    over three years (2017–2019) [68]. The IoT is creating new opportunities and providing
    competitive advantages for businesses in both current and new markets. IoT-enabling
    technologies have changed the things that are connected to the Internet, especially
    with the emergence of Tactile Internet and mobile moments (i.e., the moments in
    which a person or an intelligent device pulls out a device to receive context-aware
    service in real-time). Such technology has been integrated into connected devices,
    which range from home appliances and automobiles to wearables and virtual assistants.
    The IoT technologies and applications will bring fundamental changes in individuals’
    and society’s views of how technology and business work in the world. A human-centred
    IoT environment requires tackling new technological trends and challenges. This
    has an important impact on the research activities that need to be accelerated
    without compromising the thoroughness, rigorous testing and needed time required
    for commercialisation. A hyperconnected society is converging with a consumer-industrial-business
    Internet that is based on hyperconnected IoT environments. The latter require
    new IoT systems architectures that are integrated with network architecture (a
    knowledge-centric network for IoT), a system design and horizontal interoperable
    platforms that manage things that are digital, automated and connected, functioning
    in real-time, having remote access and being controlled based on Internet-enabled
    tools. Research and development are tightly coupled. Thus, the IoT research topics
    should address technologies that bring benefits, value, context and efficient
    implementation in different use cases and examples across various applications
    and industries. IoT devices require integrated electronic component solutions
    that contain sensors/actuators, processing and communication capabilities. These
    IoT devices make sensing ubiquitous at a very low cost, resulting in extremely
    strong price pressure on electronic component manufacturers. The next generation
    IoT/IIoT developments, including human-centred approaches, are interlinked with
    the evolution of enabling technologies (AI, connectivity, security, etc.) that
    require strengthening trustworthiness with electronic identities, service and
    data/knowledge portability across applications and IoT platforms. This ensures
    an evolution towards distributed IoT architectures with better efficiency, scalability,
    end-to-end security, privacy and resilience. The virtualization of functions and
    rule-based policies will allow for free, fair flow of data and sharing of data
    and knowledge, while protecting the integrity and privacy of data. Vertical industry
    stakeholders will become more and more integrated in the connectivity-network
    value chain. Moreover, unified, heterogeneous and distributed applications, combining
    information and operation technologies (IT and OT), will expose the network to
    more diverse and specific demands. Intelligent/cognitive connectivity networks
    provide multiple functionalities, including physical connectivity that supports
    transfer of information and adaptive features that adapt to user needs (context
    and content). These networks can efficiently exploit network-generated data and
    functionality in real-time and can be dynamically instantiated close to where
    data are generated and needed. The dynamically instantiated functions are based
    on intelligent algorithms that enable the network to adapt and evolve to meet
    changing requirements and scenarios and to provide context- and content- suitable
    services to users. The intelligence embedded in the network allows the functions
    of IoT platforms to be embedded within the network infrastructure and data, and
    the knowledge generated by the intelligent connectivity network and by the users/things
    can be used by the network itself. This knowledge can be taken advantage of in
    applications outside of the network. The connectivity networks for next generation
    IoT/IIoT are transforming into intelligent platform infrastructures that will
    provide multiple functionalities and will be ubiquitous, pervasive and more integrated,
    further embedding telephone/cellular, Internet/data and knowledge networks. Advanced
    technologies are required for the NGI to provide the energy-efficient, intelligent,
    scalable, high-capacity and high-connectivity performance required for the intelligent
    and dynamically adaptable infrastructure to provide digital services – experiences
    that can be developed and deployed by humans and things. In this context, the
    connectivity networks provide energy efficiency and high performance as well as
    the edge-network intelligence infrastructure using AI, Machine Learning (ML),
    Deep Learning (DL), Neural Networks (NNs) and other techniques for decentralised
    and automated network management, data analytics and shared contexts and knowledge.
    Standardisation and solutions are needed for designing products to support multiple
    IoT standards or ecosystems and research on new standards and related APIs. Summarizing,
    although huge efforts have been made within the IERC community for the design
    and development of IoT technologies, the continuously changing IoT landscape and
    the introduction of new requirements and technologies creates new challenges or
    raise the need to revisit existing well-acknowledged solutions. Thus, below is
    a list of the main open research challenges for the future of IoT: IoT architectures
    considering the requirements of distributed intelligence at the edge, cognition,
    artificial intelligence, context awareness, tactile applications, heterogeneous
    devices, end-to-end security, privacy, trust, safety and reliability. IoT systems
    architectures integrated with network architecture forming a knowledge-centric
    network for IoT. Intelligence and context awareness at the IoT edge, using advanced
    distributed predictive analytics. IoT applications that anticipate human and machine
    behaviours for social support. Tactile Internet of Things applications and supportive
    technologies. Augmented reality and virtual reality IoT applications. Autonomics
    in IoT towards the Internet of Autonomous Things. Inclusion of robotics in the
    IoT towards the Internet of Robotic Things. Artificial intelligence and machine
    learning mechanisms for automating IoT processes. Distributed IoT systems using
    securely interconnected and synchronized mobile edge IoT clouds. Stronger distributed
    and end-to-end holistic security solutions for IoT, preventing the exploitation
    of IoT devices for launching cyber-attacks, i.e., remotely controlling IoT devices
    for launching Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. Stronger privacy solutions,
    considering the requirements of the new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
    [80] for protecting the users’ personal data from unauthorized access, employing
    protective measures (such as Privacy Enhancing Technologies – PETs) as closer
    to the user as possible. Cross-layer optimization of networking, analytics, security,
    communication and intelligence. IoT-specific heterogeneous networking technologies
    that consider the diverse requirements of IoT applications, mobile IoT devices,
    delay tolerant networks, energy consumption, bidirectional communication interfaces
    that dynamically change characteristics to adapt to application needs, dynamic
    spectrum access for wireless devices, and multi-radio IoT devices. Adaptation
    of software defined radio and software defined networking technologies in the
    IoT. 3.2.1 Digitisation Digitisation is being utilised in many fields, and, as
    time passes, the influence of digital approaches and techniques is becoming more
    apparent in several industrial sectors. Buildings and cities are becoming smarter
    the larger the number of digital services they offer, vehicles are becoming self-driving,
    design processes are becoming highly efficient and objects and spaces can be visualised
    before being materialized thanks to the available digital information. Devices
    with embedded sensors featuring complex logic are scattered everywhere; they measure
    light, noise, sound, humidity and temperature and are empowered to communicate
    with each other to form IoT ecosystems. A common element in all of these developments
    is that digitisation creates a great amount of information. A considerable part
    of this information reveals how objects work internally and as elements of more
    complex setups. Accordingly, many innovative technological installations offer
    creative solutions concerning how to collect and process this information and
    how to take necessary action. The challenge with this information is related to
    how things interact with each other and with the environment while exhibiting
    behaviour that is often similar to human behaviour. This behaviour cannot be accurately
    handled by robots, drones, etc., so this is where technologies, such as swarm
    logic and AI, come into play. Security-perceived threats almost always trigger
    interactive installations equipped to sense and react to surrounding parameters.
    Changes in these parameters can be visualised, increasing the chances of real
    threats being detected and asserted. Thanks to advanced visualisation techniques,
    the threat landscape is better defined. While security used to be primarily about
    securing information, the landscape has widened considerably. The timely transfer
    of information, threat identification, isolation and correct and traceable actions
    all rely on security protection. IoT ecosystems evolve, so too must security strategies,
    which have to account for the layered architecture, where all things, encryptions,
    communications and actions must be protected against a growing number of diverse
    attacks, whether via hardware, software or physical tampering. The IoT system
    can be seen as a group of agents with non-coordinated individual actions that
    can collectively use local information to derive new knowledge as a basis for
    some global actions. The intelligence lies both in agents (AI) and in their interactions
    (collective intelligence). At the core of swarm logic is the sharing of information
    and interactions with each other and the surroundings to derive new information.
    However, this collective intelligence is prone to a number of attacks, especially
    related to malicious nodes sending false information to influence the decision-making
    system. Thus, reputation and trust management systems should be in place to be
    able to identify malicious or misbehaving system agents/nodes and remove them
    from the system until they behave normally again. These types of attacks can be
    easily identified and corrected at the edge of the network without having to move
    all the information to the cloud. Swarm agents can locate and isolate the threat
    and then converge towards a common point of processing. This is visualised by
    depicting the real-time state of the agent’s movement. Swarm-designed security
    is inspired by nature; hence, if IoT can uncover behaviour patterns (of birds,
    ants, etc.), it may also be capable of meeting security challenges with well-functioning
    solutions. 3.2.2 Tactile IoT/IIoT The Tactile IoT/IIoT is a shift in the collaborative
    paradigm, adding human-centred perspective and sensing/actuating capabilities
    transported over the network to communications modalities, so that people and
    machines no longer need to be physically close to the systems they operate or
    interact with as they can be controlled remotely. Tactile IoT/IIoT combines ultra-low
    latency with extremely high availability, reliability and security and enables
    humans and machines to interact with their environment, in real-time, using haptic
    interaction with visual feedback, while on the move and within a certain spatial
    communication range. Faster Internet connections and increased bandwidth allow
    to increase the information garnered from onsite sensors within industrial IoT
    network. This requires new software and hardware for managing storing, analysing
    and accessing the extra data quickly and seamlessly through a Tactile IoT/IIoT
    applications. Hyperconnectivity is needed to take VR and AR to the next level
    for uniform video streaming and remote control/tactile Internet (low latency).
    The Tactile IoT/IIoT provides the capabilities to enable the delivery of real-time
    control and physical (haptic) experiences remotely. The capabilities of the Tactile
    IoT/IIoT support the creation of a personal spatial safety zone, which is able
    to interact with nearby objects also connected to the Tactile IoT/IIoT. If applied
    to traffic, in the long term, this safety zone will be able to protect drivers,
    passengers and pedestrians. Autonomous vehicles could detect safety-critical situations
    and react instantly to avoid traffic accidents and warn other objects of impending
    danger. In production environments, occupational safety levels will improve as
    production machines or robots detect and avoid the risk of harm to people in their
    vicinity [45]. A representation of the Tactile Internet of Things Model is shown
    in Figure 3.4. Figure 3.4 Tactile Internet of Things model. Source: Adapted from
    Prof Eckehard Steinbach, TU Munich. The Tactile IoT/IIoT is the next evolution
    that enables the control of the IoT/IIoT in real-time, with all human senses interacting
    with machines, by using various technologies both at the network and application
    level to enable and enhance the interaction in the cyberspace. At the edges, the
    Tactile IoT/IIoT will be enabled by the sensor/actuators and robotic “things”.
    Content and data are transmitted over a 5G network, while intelligence is enabled
    close to the user experience through mobile edge computing. At the application
    level, automation, robotics, telepresence, AR, VR and AI will be integrated in
    various IoT/IIoT use cases. The Tactile IoT/IIoT provides a medium for remote
    physical interaction in real-time, which requires the exchange of closed-loop
    information between virtual and/or real objects (i.e., humans, machines and processes).
    The IEEE P1918.1 working group defines the Tactile Internet as a “network or network
    of networks for remotely accessing, perceiving, manipulating or controlling real
    or virtual objects or processes in perceived real-time by humans or machines”
    [44]. The domains of Tactile IoT are illustrated in Figure 3.5. The Tactile Internet
    will benefit VR by providing the low-latency communication required to enable
    “Shared Haptic Virtual Environments”, where several users are physically coupled
    via a VR simulation to perform tasks that require fine-motor skills. Haptic feedback
    is a prerequisite for high-fidelity interaction, allowing the user to perceive
    the objects in the VR not only audio-visually but also via the sense of touch.
    This allows for sensitive object manipulations as required in tele-surgery, micro-assembly
    or related applications demanding high levels of sensitivity and precision. When
    two users interact with the same object, a direct force coupling brought into
    existence by the VR and the users can feel one another’s actions. High-fidelity
    interaction is only possible if the communication latency between the users and
    the VR is in the order of a few milliseconds. During these few milliseconds, the
    movements of the users need to be transmitted to the VR server, where the physical
    simulation is computed, and the result is returned to the users in the form of
    object status updates and haptic feedback. Typical update rates for the physical
    simulation and the display of haptic information are in the order of 1000 Hertz,
    which corresponds to an ideal round-trip communication latency of 1 millisecond
    (ms) [45]. Figure 3.5 Tactile Internet of Things representation. The use of 5G
    wireless communications for Tactile IoT/IIoT requires latencies of 1 ms or less.
    The speed of light in fibre is about 200 km/s. Tactile IoT/IIoT which are distributed
    over distances larger than about 200 km will require a low-latency IoT core network
    [50]. Tactile Internet has to meet a number of design requirements such as very
    low end-to-end latency of 1 ms, high reliability for real-time response, data
    security, availability and dependability of systems without violating the very
    low latency requirement due to additional encryption delays. These key design
    objectives of the Tactile Internet can only be accomplished by keeping tactile
    applications local, close to the users, which calls for a distributed (i.e., decentralized)
    service platform architecture based on cloudlets and mobile edge computing. Furthermore,
    scalable procedures at all protocol layers are needed to reduce the end-to-end
    latency from sensors to actuators. Importantly, the Tactile Internet will set
    demanding requirements for future access networks in terms of latency, reliability,
    and also capacity (e.g., high data rates for video sensors) [51]. Tactile Internet
    of Things interactions are illustrated in Figure 3.6. In the future, coworking
    with robots in IoT applications will favour geographical clusters of local production
    (“inshoring”) and will require human expertise in the coordination of the human-robot
    symbiosis with the purpose of inventing new jobs humans can hardly imagine or
    did not even know they wanted done. Fibre-wireless (FiWi) enabled Human-to-Robot
    (H2R) communications may be a stepping stone to merging mobile IoT/IIoT, and advanced
    robotics with automation of knowledge work and cloud technologies, which together
    represent the five technologies with the highest estimated potential economic
    impact in 2025 [51, 52]. Figure 3.6 Tactile Internet of Things interactions. Source:
    Adapted from 5G LAB. As presented in Figure 3.7 current Internet cannot guarantee
    new application delivery constraints. In this context the future technological
    developments of 5G as the neutral next generation World Wide Wireless Internet
    by integrating new technologies with a holistic integrated approach combining
    IPv6-based, machine-to-machine, mobile IoT, mobile edge computing, software defined
    networks (SDN), network functions virtualisation (NFV), Fringe Internet, Tactile
    IoT/IIoT, based on seamless worldwide networking interoperability and spectrum
    harmonisation need to address and solve these constrains for the new applications.
    Figure 3.7 New applications for NGI and IoT/IIoT [99]. 3.2.3 Digital Twins for
    IoT Digital twins are virtual representations of material assets. For the IoT,
    digital twins have never been trendier, as IoT vendors are using increasingly
    more advanced technology for their implementation, not least with an add-on marketing
    effect. The current solutions provided by some of the key IoT platforms have mainly
    been for the representation of physical objects, while such features as simulation,
    manipulation and optimisation are still missing. Thanks to technologies, such
    as blockchain, swarm logic and AI, digital twins now have these capabilities.
    In the pursuit of better security, digital twins can trigger and simulate threat
    scenarios in the digital world, as well as optimise the security strategy to handle
    such scenarios should they occur in the real world. The digital twin, as a virtual
    representation of the IoT’s physical object or system across its lifecycle, using
    real-time data to enable understanding, learning and reasoning, is a one element
    connecting the IoT and AI. The digital twin represents the virtual replica of
    the IoT physical device by acting like the real thing, which helps in detecting
    possible issues, testing new settings, simulating all kinds of scenarios, analysing
    different operational and behavioural scenarios and simulating various situations
    in a virtual or digital environment, while knowing that what is performed with
    that digital twin could also happen when it is done by the ‘real’ physical “thing”.
    Digital twins as part of IoT technologies and applications are being expanded
    to more applications, use cases and industries, as well as combined with more
    technologies, such as speech capabilities, AR for an immersive experience and
    AI capabilities, enabling us to look inside the digital twin by removing the need
    to go and check the ‘real’ thing. A digital twin representation is shown in Figure
    3.8. Figure 3.8 Digital Twin representation. Source: Adapted Deloitte University
    Press. Digital twins for IoT must possess at minimum the following attributes:
    Correctness – give a correct replication of the IoT ecosystem and its devices
    Completeness – updated vis a vis the functionality in the real-world system Soundness
    – exhibit only the functionality available in the real-world system Abstractness
    – free from details specific to particular implementations Expandability – adapt
    easily to emerging technologies and applications Scalability – must be able to
    operate at any scale Parameterised – accessible for analysis, design and implementation
    Reproducible – be able to replicate the same result for the same input as the
    real system. The IoT’s digital twins can expand the interface between man and
    machine through their virtual representation and advanced technologies on levels,
    such as AI and speech, which enable people and devices/machines to take actions
    based on operational data at the edge (provided by IoT devices and edge computing
    processing). 3.3 Future Internet of Things Enabling Technologies 3.3.1 Edge Computing
    By 2023, the number of cellular IoT connections is forecast to reach 3.5 billion
    worldwide. The digitisation of assets, equipment, vehicles and processes in a
    factory means that the number of connected devices will increase exponentially.
    The estimated number of connected devices needed in a typical smart factory is
    0.5 per square metre [1]. This calculation is based on potential use cases and
    assets that would benefit from a connection. This illustrates the distribution
    of cellular connectivity requirements (supporting the previously mentioned use
    cases) in a fully deployed smart factory. The share of each type of connected
    device [2] depends on whether the site has a low or high level of automation [3].
    Evolving to a higher level of automation will increasingly lead to a higher share
    of 5G connected devices. Both high bandwidth and consistently low latency are
    necessary to support large data volumes and real-time critical data, as well as
    to ensure consistent and secure communication [20]. [1] Average number based on
    data from different manufacturing sites. In dense areas, the connection density
    could be up to one connected device per square metre. [2] The exact distribution
    figures for a specific manufacturing site depend on the communication needs. [3]
    The level of automation is a continuum from manual to fully automatic operations.
    This requires change in IoT digital infrastructures. According to Gartner, for
    example, 80 percent of enterprises will have shut down their traditional data
    centre by 2025, versus 10 percent in 2018. Workload placement, which is driven
    by a variety of business needs, is the key driver of this infrastructure evolution.
    In this context, edge computing sits at the peak of Gartner’s 2018 Hype Cycle
    for Cloud Computing and there is plenty of scope for false starts and disillusionment
    before standards and best practices are settled upon, and mainstream adoption
    can proceed. Edge computing delivers the decentralized complement to today’s hyperscale
    cloud and legacy data centres. To maximize application potential and user experience,
    technology innovation leaders plan distributed computing solutions along a continuum
    from the core to the edge. According to business-to-business (B2B) analysts MarketsandMarkets,
    the edge computing market will be worth $6.72 billion by 2022, up from an estimated
    $1.47 bn in 2017 – a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 35.4 per cent. Key
    driving factors are the advent of IoT and 5G networks, an increase in the number
    of “intelligent” applications and the growing load on cloud infrastructure. Among
    the vertical segments considered by MarketsandMarkets, Telecom and IT are expected
    to have the biggest market share during the 2017–2022 forecast period. That’s
    because enterprises faced with high network load and increasing demand for bandwidth
    will need to optimize and extend their Radio Access Network (RAN) to deliver an
    efficient Mobile (or Multi-access) Edge Computing (MEC) environment for their
    apps and services. The fastest-growing segment of the edge computing market during
    the forecast period, says MarketsandMarkets, is likely to be retail: high volumes
    of data generated by IoT sensors, cameras and beacons that feed into smart applications
    will be more efficiently collected, stored and processed at the network edge,
    rather than in the cloud or an on-premises data centre [19]. The use of intelligent
    edge devices requires reducing the amount of data sent to the cloud through quality
    filtering and aggregation, while the integration of more functions into intelligent
    devices and gateways closer to the edge reduces latency. By moving intelligence
    to the edge, local devices can generate value and optimise the processing of information
    and communication. This allows for protocol consolidation by controlling the various
    ways devices can communicate with each other. There are different edge computing
    paradigms, such as transparent computing, fog computing and mobile edge computing
    (MEC). MEC emerged in the context of 5G architectures and enables an open RAN
    as well as being able to host third party applications and content at the edge
    of the network. Fog computing, fog networking or fogging is a decentralized computing
    infrastructure in which data, processing, storage and applications are distributed
    in the most logical, efficient place between the data source and the cloud. Fog
    computing extends cloud computing and services to the edge of the network, bringing
    the advantages and power of the cloud closer to where information is created and
    acted upon. In a fog environment, intelligence is in the local area network. Information
    is transmitted from endpoints to a gateway, where it is then transmitted to sources
    for processing and return transmission. In edge computing, intelligence and power
    of the edge gateway or appliance are in devices such as programmable automation
    controllers. Edge computing allows the reduction of points of failure, as each
    edge device operates independently and determines which information to store locally
    and which to send to the cloud for further analysis. Fog computing is scalable
    and offers a view of the network as multiple data points feed information into
    it. Fog computing enables high-performance, interoperability and security in a
    multi-vendor computing-based ecosystem and is focusing on resource allocation
    at the service level, while transparent computing concentrates on logically splitting
    the software stack (including OS) from the underlying hardware platform to provide
    cross-platform and streamed services for a variety of devices. One more difference
    compared to MEC is the need to support exotic I/O and accelerator aware provisioning,
    real-time, embedded targets as well as real-time networks such as Time Sensitive
    Networks (TSN), e.g., IEEE 802.1. Another edge computing technology is represented
    by CMU’s Cloudlet, which enables new classes of mobile applications that are both
    compute-intensive and latency-sensitive in an open ecosystem based on cloudlets.
    The Cloudlets have lately been transformed to Open Edge Computing [4] based on
    OpenStack [5]. Open Edge Computing has the vision that any edge node will offer
    computational and storage resources to any user in close proximity using a standardized
    mechanism. Edge computing technologies are characterized by openness, as operators
    open the networks to third parties to deploy applications and services, while
    their differences enable edge computing technologies to support broader IoT applications
    with various requirements. [4] http://openedgecomputing.org/ [5] https://www.openstack.org/
    The connectivity requirements of the manufacturing industry are matched by the
    capabilities of cellular networks. To enable smart manufacturing, there are different
    network deployment options depending on the case-by-case needs and the digitisation
    ambitions of the factory. One option is using virtualization and Dedicated Core
    Networks (DECOR) to map local private networks and virtual networks running within
    a mobile operator’s public network. A 4G and 5G network with dedicated radio base
    stations and Evolved Packet Core in-a-box can be deployed on the premises to ensure
    that traffic stays local to the site. In this case, on-premises cellular network
    deployment with local data breakout ensures that critical production data do not
    leave the premises, using Quality of Service (QoS) mechanisms to fulfil use case
    requirements and optimize reliability and latency. Critical applications can be
    executed locally, independent of the macro network, using cellular network deployment
    with edge computing [20]. The Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) standard is developed
    in the ETSI Industry Specification Group/ISG Multi-access Edge Computing (ETSI
    ISG MEC) [96]. The ETSI ISG MEC is the leading voice in standardization and industry
    alignment concerning MEC. It is a key building block in the evolution of mobile-broadband
    networks, complementing Network Function Virtualisation (NFV) and Software Defined
    Network (SDN), and is: A key enabler for IoT and mission-critical, vertical solutions
    Widely recognized as one of the key architectural concepts and technologies for
    5G Able to enable many 5G use cases without a full 5G roll-out (i.e. with 4G networks)
    Enabling a myriad of new use cases across multiple sectors as well as innovative
    business opportunities. The ETSI ISG MEC work on Phase 2 is extending the applicability
    of MEC technology and rendering MEC even more attractive to operators, vendors
    and application developers. One example of deployment is the Cloud IoT Edge that
    extends Google Cloud’s data processing and machine learning to edge devices (e.g.,
    robotic arms, wind turbines, oil rigs, etc.) so they can act on the data from
    their sensors in real-time and predict outcomes locally. Cloud IoT Edge can run
    on Android Things or Linux-based operating systems. It is composed of two runtime
    components, Edge IoT Core and Edge ML, and takes advantage of Google’s purpose-built
    hardware accelerator ASIC chip, Edge TPUTM. The Edge TPU is a purpose-built small-footprint
    ASIC chip designed to run TensorFlow Lite machine-learning models on edge devices.
    Cloud IoT Edge is the software stack that extends Google’s cloud services to IoT
    gateways and edge devices. Cloud IoT Edge a runtime component for gateway-class
    devices (with at least one CPU) to store, translate, process and extract intelligence
    from edge data, while interoperating with the rest of Google’s Cloud IoT platform
    (see Figure 3.9) [21]. Figure 3.9 How Cloud IoT Edge works [21]. Computing at
    the edge of the mobile network defines IoT-enabled customer experiences and requires
    a resilient and robust underlying network infrastructure to drive business success.
    IoT assets and devices are connected via mobile infrastructure and cloud services
    are provided to IoT platforms to deliver real-time and context-based services.
    Edge computing uses the power of local computing and different types of devices
    to provide intelligent services. Data storage, computing and control can be separated
    and distributed among the connected edge devices (servers, micro servers, gateways,
    IoT nodes, etc.). Edge computing advantages, such as improved scalability, local
    processing, contextual computing and analytics, make it well suited to IoT application
    requirements. Edge computing technologies like MEC – offering low latency, proximity,
    high bandwidth, real-time insight into radio network information and location
    awareness – enable the development of many new types of IoT applications and services
    for industrial sectors. Augmented Reality (AR) mobile applications have inherent
    collaborative properties in terms of data collection in the uplink, computing
    at the edge and data delivery in the downlink [17]. AR information requires low
    latency and a high rate of data processing in order to provide correct information
    depending on the location of the device. The processing of information can be
    performed on a local MEC server instead of a centralized server to provide the
    user experience required. IoT devices generate additional messaging on telecommunication
    networks and require gateways to aggregate messages and ensure low latency and
    security. An architecture used for leveraging MEC to collect, classify and analyse
    the IoT data streams is presented in [18]. The MEC server manages different protocols
    and distribution of messages and processes the analytics. The MEC environment
    supports the creation of new value chains and new type of ecosystems, which provide
    new opportunities for mobile operators and application and content providers.
    Information transmission costs and latency limitations of mobile connectivity
    pose challenges to many IoT applications that rely on cloud computing. Mobile
    edge computing enables IoT applications to deliver real-time and context-based
    mobile moments to users of IoT solutions, while managing the cost base for mobile
    infrastructure. The benefits are improved performance, deployment of intelligence
    and analytics at the edge, reduced overload of the communication networks, low
    latency, compliance, satisfaction of concerns related to data privacy and data
    security and reduced operational costs. Several challenges listed below, however,
    have to be addressed when considering edge-computing implementations [91]: Mobile
    edge computing provides real-time network and context information, including location,
    while giving application developers and business leaders access to cloud computing
    capabilities and a cloud service environment that is closer to their actual users.
    Mobile edge computing implementation and integration pose the challenge of providing
    a distributed architecture with improved robustness, reliability and local intelligence,
    as well as processing that enables the autonomous execution of processes, rules
    and algorithms. Mobile edge computing is an important network infrastructure component
    for blockchain. The continuous replication of “blocks” via devices on this distributed
    data centre poses a tremendous technological challenge. Mobile edge computing
    reveals one opportunity to address this challenge. The need to optimize and reduce
    connectivity, data migration and bandwidths costs associated with sending data
    to the cloud, while implementing local intelligence, processing and distributed
    storage. Edge computing solutions for avoiding intermittent connectivity, low
    bandwidth and/or high latency at the network edge considering the increased numbers
    of smart edge devices running software for machine learning or AI software Optimization
    of the communication with nodes in the intervening edge computing infrastructure.
    Regarding future IoT applications, it is expected that more of the network intelligence
    will reside closer to the source. This will push for the rise of edge cloud/fog
    and MEC-distributed architectures, as most data will be too noisy, latency-sensitive
    or expensive to be transferred to the cloud. Edge computing technologies for IoT
    require developers to address issues such as unstable and intermittent data transmission
    via wireless and mobile links, efficient distribution and management of data storage
    and computing, edge computing interfacing with the cloud computing to provide
    scalable services and, finally, mechanisms to secure IoT applications. The edge
    computing model requires a distributed architecture and needs to support various
    interactions and communication approaches to be used broader in consumer/business/industrial
    domains. To do this, it needs to provide peer-to-peer networking, edge-device
    collaboration (self-organizing, self-aware, self-healing, etc.), distributed queries
    across data stored in edge devices as well as in the cloud and temporary storage
    locations, distributed data management, (e.g., for defining where, what, when
    and how long, in relation to data storage) and information governance (e.g., information
    quality, discovery, usability, privacy, security, etc.). In this context, the
    research challenges in this area are: Open distributed edge computing architectures
    and implementations for IoT and IIoT (IT/OT convergence for IoT applications as

    equipment are placed at the edge of the network, while information technologies

    Intelligence Artificial intelligence concerns activity devoted to making machines
    intelligent, with intelligence understood as a quality that enables an entity
    to function appropriately and with foresight in its environment [43]. Intelligent
    IoT devices are considered intelligent machines, while the collective attributes
    of a machine (i.e., computer, robot or other device) capable of performing functions,
    such as learning, decision-making or other intelligent human behaviours, are defined
    as AI. IoT-based sensor data generated in healthcare, bioinformatics, information
    sciences and policy- and decision-making in governments and enterprises can be
    processed using methods that rely on AI to provide new data insights and generate
    new types of knowledge. The benefits of both AI and the IoT can be expanded when
    the technologies are combined, both on the edge devices’ end and core servers’
    end. AI machine-learning methods can obtain insights from the data to analyse
    and predict the future connections of IoT devices in advance. AI is playing a
    starring role in the IoT because of its ability to quickly bring insights from
    data. ML offers the ability to automatically identify patterns and detect anomalies
    in the data that smart sensors and devices generate: information such as temperature,
    pressure, humidity, air quality, vibration and sound. Companies are finding that
    machine learning can provide significant advantages over traditional business
    intelligence tools for analysing IoT data, including being able to make operational
    predictions up to 20 times sooner and with greater accuracy than threshold-based
    monitoring systems [25]. Figure 3.10 Gartner’s Hype Cycle for emerging technologies
    2018. AI techniques extend machine learning strategies that can be applied to
    intelligent IoT devices for complex decisions based on detecting patterns, self-learning,
    self-healing, context-awareness and autonomous decision-making. These will involve
    and affect the future implementations of digital twin models and continuous learning
    with roles in autonomous vehicles applications, the IoRT and predictive maintenance.
    Democratized AI, defined as the possibility to put the AI techniques under the
    reach of everyone, is one of five trends, along with digitalized ecosystems, do-it-yourself
    biohacking, transparently immersive experiences and ubiquitous infrastructure,
    that is driving Gartner’s latest Hype Cycle for emerging technologies (see Figure
    3.10) [42], derived from 35 individual technologies. The five trends blur the
    lines between human and machine with the AI group containing technologies such
    as AI platform as a service (PaaS), artificial general intelligence, autonomous
    driving (Levels 4 and 5), autonomous mobile robots, conversational AI platform,
    deep neural nets, flying autonomous vehicles, smart robots and virtual assistants.
    The technologies enabling the next generation IoT are included under all five
    areas and comprise AI, edge AI, autonomous systems, blockchain, digital twins,
    augmented reality (AR), 5G, neuromorphic hardware and IoT platforms. The ubiquitous
    infrastructures of edge computing and the always-on, always-available, limitless
    infrastructure environment are enabling technologies that form the basis for the
    next generation IoT landscape. When combined, AI and IoT transform both the Internet,
    the global economy and societal interactions. Within the next decade, it is expected
    that AI and machine learning to be embedded in various forms of technology that
    incorporate information exchange, analysis and knowledge. The opportunities created
    range from new services and breakthroughs in science, to the augmentation of human
    and machine intelligence and their convergence with the digital, virtual and cyber
    worlds. The future challenges related to the delegation of decision-making to
    machines and IoT autonomous systems, lack of transparency and whether technological
    change will outpace the development of governance and policy norms need to be
    addressed and solutions must be provided. The evolution of basic forms of AI from
    assisted, augmented, autonomous to collaborative is illustrated in Figure 3.11.
    In this context, the development of software and IoT devices capable of making
    ethical judgements as part of autonomous collaborative systems is emerging. As
    IoT autonomous systems are developing and combined with the ubiquity of AI in
    applications, such as the Internet of Vehicles for driverless vehicles, artificial
    ethical agents could become a legal necessity. Figure 3.11 Artificial Intelligence
    Roadmap. The combined developments in AI and the IoT enable new ways of interacting
    with connected objects through voice or gesture, while AR and virtual reality
    (VR) are powered by data generated by the IoT. Sensor/actuator technologies, the
    IoT, AI and increased connectivity bandwidth (ubiquitous, reliable and secure
    connectivity) are pushing the development of the Tactile IoT based on the convergence
    of these technologies where the lines between the digital and the physical blur.
    The disruptive nature of AI comes from the speed, precision, and capacity of augmenting
    humanity. When AI is defined through seven outcomes as presented in Figure 3.12,
    the business value of AI projects gain meaning and can easily show business value
    through a spectrum of outcomes [54, 55]: Perception describes what is happening
    now. Notification is a way of providing answers to questions through alerts, workflows,
    reminders and other signals that help deliver additional information through combined
    manual input and machine learning. Suggestion recommends action. This is built
    on past behaviours and modifications over time that are based on weighted attributes,
    decision management and machine learning. Automation repeats recurrent actions.
    It is leveraged as machine learning matures over time and tuning takes place.
    Prediction informs what to expect. It builds on deep learning and neural networks
    to anticipate and test for behaviours. Prevention helps avoid negative outcomes.
    It applies cognitive reckoning to identify potential threats. Situational awareness
    explains what must be known immediately. It resembles mimicking human capabilities
    in decision making. AI methods to search for information in data and for learning
    from past and predict the future is illustrated in Figure 3.13. Figure 3.12 Outcomes
    of Artificial Intelligence. Source: Constellation Research. Figure 3.13 Artificial
    Intelligence methods. Companies face a difficult task when deciding which opportunities
    to pursue, among the hundreds available, but they can narrow their options through
    a structured approach. The first step involves picking an industry and identifying
    the potential for disruption within the industry, which is estimated by looking
    at the number of AI use cases, start-up equity funding, and the total economic
    impact of AI, defined as the extent to which solutions reduced costs, increased
    productivity, or otherwise benefited the bottom line in a retrospective analysis
    of various applications. The greater the economic benefit, the more likely that
    customers will pay for an AI solution. Figure 3.14 shows the data compiled for
    17 industries for AI-related metrics [46]. AI is a promising technological innovation,
    raising already high expectations for 2025. The IoT is the source of data for
    AI and machine learning applications, as fleets of connected IoT devices, autonomous
    vehicles and robots need to be automated to allow them to react to environmental
    conditions in real-time. By 2021, AI will support more than 80% of emerging technologies,
    while, in the following year, it will support more than 80% of enterprise IoT
    projects, according to Gartner. By 2020, it will create 2.3 million jobs, although
    50% of organizations will lack the relevant AI and data talent. Figure 3.14 AI
    dependency on market size, pain points, and willingness to pay across different
    industries. Source: Adapted from McKinsey & Company, [46]. While software has
    been a predominant factor in most corporate and investor interest for many years,
    hardware has become important again with the growth of AI. The cloud continues
    to be an option for various applications, not least due to its scale advantage,
    and the choice between cloud or edge solutions will depend on the IoT use cases
    and applications. Regarding cloud hardware, the market remains fragmented. The
    hardware preference of customers and suppliers vary for application-specific integrated
    circuit (ASIC) technology and graphics processing units (GPUs). The low latency
    connectivity at the edge is critical, driving the current development and growing
    role for inference at the edge. ASICs — with their superior performance per watt
    — provide a more optimized user experience, including lower power consumption
    and higher processing, for many applications. Enterprise edge is covered by several
    technologies, such as field programmable gate arrays, GPUs and ASIC technology.
    The ML and DL technology stack is divided into nine layers [46], across services,
    training, platform, interface, and hardware as presented in Figure 3.15. Figure
    3.15 Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) technology multi-layered stack.
    Source: Adapted from McKinsey & Company, [46]. Despite rather old technological
    foundations, in recent years, machine learning has brought about important progress
    for applications such as computer vision or natural language processing. It has
    also recently attracted sizeable investments with an explosion in VC money and
    a growing focus (through buy outs and investments) amongst Internet companies.
    The key AI innovations are presented Figure 3.16. The most anticipated AI applications
    for 2025 move beyond the current focus on language and vision by targeting advanced
    data analytics capacities and enabling decision-making applications. Figure 3.16

    DigiWorld. Unprecedented abilities in Data Analytics If computers are starting
    to catch up with humans in their ability to detect objects in images, applying
    deep learning to a field where algorithms are already ahead of most humans, such
    as data analytics, promises potentially momentous breakthroughs. Figure 3.17 AI
    adoption/maturity vs. value at stake. Source: Adapted from McKinsey & Company,
    [46]. Applying deep learning to data analytics enables complex pattern recognition
    and prediction. This is especially noteworthy in the case of “unsupervised training”
    machine learning, that is, when the algorithm is fed with unstructured data and
    tries to spot interesting patterns on its own. Several industries offer the strongest
    opportunities for AI: public sector, banking, retail, and automotive as presented
    in Figure 3.17. While the public sector’s prominence may seem surprising in an
    age where governments are cutting budgets, many officials see the value of AI
    in improving efficiency and efficacy, and they are willing to provide funding.
    As they plan their AI strategies, suppliers may focus their investments on potential
    consumers of AI solutions who are willing to be the first domino [46]. An important
    domain concerning the application of deep learning data analytics is the health
    sector. Using deep learning approaches can help in health record data analysis
    to improve diagnostics, risk analysis and preventive medication. Examples of health
    applications include reconstructing brain circuits, predicting the activity of
    potential drug molecules or predicting the effects of mutations in non-coding
    DNA on gene expressions. The Mount Sinai Hospital (see Figure 3.18) recently highlighted
    the potential for using unstructured deep learning in the secondary use of electronic
    health records in order to predict health status, as well as to help prevent disease
    or disability. The interest in deep learning approaches is especially strong in
    the case of traditional data analysis methodologies, which have been applied with
    limited success, as it can improve prediction results. Figure 3.18 Use of unstructured
    deep learning in the analysis of hospital patient data. Source: Nature/Mount Sinai
    Hospital. The IoT as Key Data provider for AI Access to relevant data sets (often
    derived from vertical industries) in order to train the deep learning algorithms
    will be critical. The development of the IoT can play a critical role in providing
    access to the relevant data sets for training future AI including the digital
    twin models. Shrinking computer chips and improved manufacturing techniques have
    led to cheaper and more powerful sensors. As the number of sensors employed in
    IoT ecosystems increases rapidly, so do the amounts of raw data produced, in turn
    calling for new computational models to handle this by employing intelligence
    at the edge for information processing. The new computational models need to cope
    not only with larger quantities but also with increased complexity of the raw
    data in terms of their syntax and semantics. Machine learning and deep learning
    are able to collect and process data from billions of sensors. Algorithmic developments
    in AI are coupled with increased data resources and computational demands that
    are served mainly today by cloud infrastructures. New developments to address
    AI algorithms for processing data at the edge are underway. Despite the rapid
    advances of AI in vision, speech recognition, natural language processing and
    dialog, there is still room for improvement when developing end-to-end intelligent
    systems that must encapsulate multiple competencies and deliver services in real-time
    using limited resources. In this direction, the developments are focusing on designing
    and delivering embedded and hierarchical AI solutions in the combined IoT/IIoT,
    edge and cloud computing environments that provide real-time decisions, using
    less data and computational resources, while orchestrating the access to each
    type of resource in a way that enhances the accuracy and performance of the models.
    The distributed AI concept builds on top of a hierarchy where low-level, context-agnostic
    models, which run on the IoT and on IoT devices, can dynamically feed higher-order
    models running on higher-capacity resources, so as to better capture the context
    knowledge. Due to the adoption of AI methods and techniques making use of a wide
    range of available resources (IoT/IIoT/edge/cloud), IoT applications are now able
    to offer a trade-off between accuracy and performance, depending on the overall
    requirements. Complex IoT applications allow distributed intelligence embedded
    in limited resource sensors at the edge of the network, providing an effective
    demonstrator of the potential of AI as a service model. There is a need to identify
    AI and machine learning (ML) methodologies for temporal data to build distributed
    learning systems that can scale from the IoT/IIoT to edge and cloud resources.
    The development of connected vehicles, smart cities and connected health are especially
    likely to provide access to the massive amounts of data required by deep learning
    approaches. However, other domains of IoT deployments, such as the industrial
    Internet are increasingly generating data sets that could fit the deep learning
    approach. The number of data points that manufacturing facilities generate and
    the ability to find correlations and pattern and recommend decisions among these
    IoT data could be addressed by deep learning or other AI methods approaches. AI
    and IoT/IIoT requirements for complex integrated systems In complex IoT applications,
    the same conditions will seldom apply twice to the same situation, even when they
    involve the same process; the context and the operation conditions in a specific
    environment, such as the stress and fatigue of the equipment, always contribute
    to the creation of an entirely new set of input values for the model. To cope
    with this expected richness of the model, feedback and training data need to be
    requested continuously and by a multitude of manufacturing equipment, resulting
    in a default global (and hence, cross-border) AI model. Deep learning approaches
    can aggregate the underlying model inputs and gradually build the necessary user
    and context profiles, but the models (low and higher order) need to continuously
    adapt to the influx of new data. A multi-parametric model of manufacturing equipment
    profiles requires the federation of a multitude of underlying models and data
    (functional, behavioural, environment, operational, informational, etc.), orchestrated
    in a distributed and decentralized fashion so as to ensure that the evaluation
    is happening close to the data sources (ensuring real-time reactions) in an efficient
    and collaborative fashion. Thus, the applications across industrial sectors integrating
    AI and IoT need to address a multitude of requirements in order to fulfil the
    integration of functional and non-functional attributes for such complex systems.
    The requirements for complex IoT/IIoT systems that have embedded artificial intelligence
    (AI) techniques and methods can be summarized as presented in Figure 3.19 and
    the following list: Figure 3.19 AI and IoT/IIoT requirements for complex system
    integrated systems. Explainability: Enables human users to understand the decisions
    made by AI systems and the rationale behind them. This ability will make it easier
    to track down eventual failures and assess decisions’ strengths and weaknesses.
    Ultimately, this will increase the trust in the systems’ decisions. This ability
    will have to integrate with human-computer interface techniques which are able
    to track complex reasoning processes. Availability: Enables IoT applications to
    provide data and resources in a timely manner for a set percentage of time (i.e.,
    the uptime) as well as retain their core functionality, even if the system has
    undergone a security attack. Industrial IoT applications may target mission-critical
    tasks along the production line; system outages will therefore have direct economic
    impact. In the near future, it is also envisaged that IoT systems, due to embedded
    AI, will be able to perform autonomously via online learning over their lifetime
    and remove even the downtime needed for maintenance. AI systems should be available
    in terms of integration into new applications and process steps. Trustworthiness:
    Enables IoT systems to be trusted, only allowing authenticated devices or services
    that can be uniquely identified to participate in the decision-making processes
    of the system. This makes it possible to report the source of vulnerabilities
    and inconsistencies. As more and more AI-enabled systems become connected through
    the IoT, trustworthiness becomes an indispensable requirement. Precisely due to
    the AI, trustworthiness will become multi-dimensional, far beyond verifying identity.
    Consequently, trust will no longer be ‘true’ or ‘false’, but rather about degrees
    of trustworthiness that will control the access levels of devices/users to critical
    services. Security: Enables systems to guarantee distributed end-to-end security,
    which is essential to ensure robustness against all types of attack vectors in
    the IoT. This includes securing the AI system itself as well as securing communication
    between edge computing IoT devices with encryption and authentication mechanisms
    against attacks with manipulated input data. Safety: Enables systems to protect
    persons and objects during operation. AI systems that operate physically next
    to and collaboratively with humans through robots or other machines must not exhibit
    random or unpredictable behaviour. Safety by design is essential, entailing compliance
    with relevant safety standards. Importantly, the employed AI and IoT systems must
    be robust against implausible data and operate with extremely low latency to quickly
    and appropriately react to unforeseen events (i.e., to prevent accidents). Privacy:
    Enables IoT and AI-based systems that operate on mission- and business-critical
    data to keep this data private. This entails both limiting access to and placing
    restrictions on certain types of information with the goal of preventing unauthorized
    access (confidentiality) as well as protecting data from being modified or corrupted
    without detection. Such data must therefore be processed locally at the edge and
    only leverage data available within privacy limits (smart data). Transparency:
    Enables IoT and AI-based systems to provide insight into devices and processes
    in situations such as auditing, inspections to assess vulnerabilities, or when
    security breaches arise. This may be supported by digital twins that represent
    the complete system state at any point in time. AI methods for data visualization
    can further enhance transparency and contribute to making the systems state easier
    to understand. Fairness: Enables IoT systems which embed AI technologies to support
    or automate decision processes while adhering to the same fairness and compliance
    standards as humans. Inclusiveness: Enables AI-based IoT systems to allow human
    intervention even in the most automated decision and communication processes.
    This is essential to avoid the formation of isolated non-AI capable sub-systems
    within a process, production system or supply chain. Collaboration: Enables AI-based
    IoT systems to self-organize around a common goal; for example, in the presence
    of a threat, as well as to collaborate with humans, both physically (e.g., human-robot
    collaboration) and by exchanging information (human-machine interfaces). Collaboration
    is an emergent property of complex interactions and dynamics, increasingly present
    in industry. Industry-grade AI will not be concentrated on a single device or
    system. Instead, many different AI-enabled subsystems will be distributed (distributed
    AI) across IoT nodes, embedded devices and other edge devices (embedded AI). Integration:
    Enables IoT-embedding AI systems to exhibit an open and flexible perspective by
    consolidating insights from all existing systems and processes. Bridging possible
    gaps is a key prerequisite of the establishing AI methods in the industry according
    to a sustainable roadmap. Reliability: Enables IoT systems to operate without
    systems outages and regular human intervention. Reliability is essential for productivity
    and is a key prerequisite for AI systems that are put into continuous operation
    with short maintenance time in mission-critical production environments. Resiliency:
    Enables IoT with embedded AI to always operate in stable states, including to
    return to such states after failures. Resilience is essential for their safe support
    for our digital economy. In the future, they should even be able to detect failure
    and initiate measures for compensating it. Accountability: Enables IoT systems
    with embedded AI systems that support or even replace human decisions to be accountable
    to their customers, partners and regulators. Normally, accountability features
    will be integrated “by design” and will be available via the supplier of these
    systems. Verifiability: Enables IoT and AI-based systems to demonstrate the functionality
    and properties they are supposed to have. AI systems for industrial applications
    must fulfil the same standards as legacy systems and will be applied to safety-,
    mission- and business-critical tasks. This requires that AI embedded systems can
    be validated (to reach correct results), verified (verifiable AI) and certified
    (certifiable AI) for the targeted applications. The research challenges for implementing
    AI at the edge of networks for IoT applications are as follows: Mechanisms for
    collecting and aggregating data and information and developing edge models that
    generate insights from the data available in real-time by providing methods and
    techniques to train models in the edge environment with appropriately distributed
    storage capabilities ‘AI-friendly’ processors to address the AI workloads for
    IoT applications requiring AI computationally intensive capabilities; research
    and development concerning architectural concepts to shift central control to
    the edge and the use of modified graphics processor units, hybrid processors and
    AI-based processors, embedding accelerators and neural networks for processing
    specific AI algorithms New energy- and resource-efficient methods for image recognition
    and geospatial processing using AI at the edge, based on machine learning and
    other AI techniques Edge computing implementation based on neuromorphic computing
    and in-memory computing to process unstructured data, such as images or video,
    used in IoT applications Edge computing implementations based on distributed approaches
    for IoT computing systems at the edge Distributed IoT end-to-end security for
    AI-based solutions that process data at the edge using a group of edge nodes to
    work together on a particular task, thereby ensuring that no security holes or
    attacks are possible AI for smart data storage in edge-based IoT AI for software-defined

    IoT/IIoT 3.3.3 Networks and Communication It is predicted that the adoption of
    low-power short-range networks for wireless IoT connectivity will increase through
    2025 and will coexist with wide-area IoT networks [82], while 5G networks will
    deliver 1,000 to 5,000 times more capacity than 3G and 4G networks today. IoT
    technologies are extending known business models, leading to the proliferation
    of different ones as companies push beyond the data, analytics and intelligence
    boundaries. IoT devices will be contributing to and strongly driving this development.
    Changes will first be embedded in given communication standards and networks and
    subsequently in the communication and network structures defined by these standards.
    5G and the IoT promise new capabilities and use cases, which are set to impact
    not only consumer services but also many industries embarking on their digital
    transformations. New massive IoT cellular technologies, such as NB-IoT and Cat-M1,
    are taking off and driving growth in the number of cellular IoT connections, with
    a CAGR of 30 percent expected between 2017 and 2023. These complementary technologies
    support diverse LPWAN use cases over the same underlying LTE network [20]. 3.3.3.1
    Network technology – hyperconnectivity beyond 5G The development of critical communication
    capabilities will be an essential enabler for the development of the IoT. It will
    enable IoT use cases to go beyond data collection and respond to complex scenarios
    requiring precise actuation, automation and mission critical communications. The
    next generation technological enhancements to telecommunication networks, brought
    about by 5G, will allow new connectivity to become the catalyst for next generation
    IoT services by creating innovations such as advanced modulation schemes for wireless
    access, network slicing capabilities, automated network application lifecycle
    management, software-defined networking and network function virtualization, as
    well as providing support for edge- and cloud-optimized distributed network applications.
    The requirements of critical IoT communications are numerous and diverse, ranging
    from the increased reliability and resilience of the communication network, to
    ultra-low latencies and high capacity, while also integrating the context of the
    mission with the ability to respond to strict energy efficiency constraints or
    to cover large outdoor areas, deep indoor environments or vehicles moving at high
    speeds. Bandwidth and delay for services enabled by legacy networks and 5G are
    presented in Figure 3.20. Figure 3.20 Bandwidth and delay for services enabled
    by legacy networks and 5G. Source: Adapted from [95]. Table 3.1 Key critical IoT
    communications requirements Requirements Details Reliability High availability
    of the network Low packet losses Resilience Ability to function in degraded conditions
    Low convergence time Energy efficiency Projected lifespan of equipment batteries
    Low latencies End-to-end latencies of communication systems under 10 ms and sometimes
    inferior (under 5 ms or even under 1 ms). Coverage Coverage of very a large area
    (rural) Deep indoor coverage Coverage of moving vehicles Ability to deploy and
    use private networks Security Authentication of communications Encryption of communications
    Attack detections Capacity Ability of the network to operate with a very large
    number of users Source: IDATE. Starting with LTE Advanced, cellular communication
    standards have begun responding to these requirements by developing new technologies.
    These first developments are opening new possibilities, especially for public
    safety operations, but they are still limited in scope. They notably lack the
    ability to provide the ultra-low latencies required by many critical use cases.
    The development of 5G is seen as central to enabling critical IoT communications;
    indeed, many of the planned 5G features (from network slicing and massive multi-user
    multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) to new messaging services, cellular vehicles-to-everything
    or improved relay capabilities) represent highly important advances for critical
    scenarios, including reliable, low latencies. The critical IoT communications
    requirements are presented in Table 3.1. End-to-end (E2E) network slicing is a
    foundation to support diversified 5G services and is key to 5G network architecture
    evolution. Based on Network Functions Virtualisation (NFV) and Software Defined
    Network (SDN), physical infrastructure of the future network architecture consists
    of sites and three-layer data centres (DCs). Sites support multiple modes (such
    as 5G, LTE, and Wi-Fi) in the form of macro, micro, and pico base stations to
    implement the RAN real-time function. These functions have high requirements for
    computing capability and real-time performance and require the inclusion of specific
    dedicated hardware. Three-layer cloud DC consists of computing and storage resources.
    The bottom layer is the central office DC, which is closest in relative proximity
    to the base station side. The second layer is the local DC, and the upper layer
    is the regional DC, with each layer of arranged DCs connected through transport
    networks. According to diversified service requirements, networks generate corresponding
    network topologies and a series of network function sets (network slices) for
    each corresponding service type using NFV on a unified physical infrastructure.
    Each network slice is derived from a unified physical network infrastructure,
    which greatly reduces subsequent operators’ network construction costs. Network
    slices feature a logical arrangement and are separated as individual structures,
    which allows for heavily customizable service functions and independent operation
    and management [47]. Advanced ML and AI techniques can also be used for optimizing
    the connectivity of future mobile heterogeneous IoT devices to allow them to support
    efficiently a number of diverse services. ML techniques can be used to identify
    the optimal radio technology in mobile IoT devices considering the load and the
    services they support. Additionally, in future cognitive radio-based IoT devices,
    ML techniques can be used to optimize the spectrum channel and width, the devices
    will use and create a self-organizing network of cooperating devices to improve
    spectrum utilization [92–94]. Figure 3.21 End-to-End Network Slicing for Multiple
    Industries Based on One Physical Infrastructure [47]. As illustrated in Figure
    3.21, Enhanced Mobile Broad Band (eMBB), Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communications
    (uRLLC), and Machine Type Communications (mMTC) are independently supported on
    a single physical infrastructure. eMBB slicing has high requirements for bandwidth
    to deploy cache in the mobile cloud engine of a local DC, which provides high-speed
    services located in close proximity to users, reducing bandwidth requirements
    of backbone networks. uRLLC slicing has strict latency requirements in application
    scenarios of self-driving, assistant driving, and remote management. RAN Real-Time
    and non-Real-Time processing function units must be deployed on the site side
    providing a beneficial location preferably based in close proximity to users.
    Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) server and service gateways must be deployed in the
    mobile cloud engine of the central office DC, with only control-plane functions
    deployed in the local and regional DCs. mMTC slicing involves a small amount of
    network data interaction and a low frequency of signalling interaction in most
    MTC scenarios. This consequently allows the mobile cloud engine to be deployed
    in the local DC, and other additional functions and application servers can be
    deployed in the regional DC, which releases central office resources and reduces
    operating expenses [47]. Highly dependent upon both the creation of new technologies
    and the deployment of new communication networks (requiring both important investments
    all along the value chain), critical IoT capabilities are unlikely to be largely
    available before 2025. The 5G spectrum high bands are expected to be deployed
    include the 28 GHz band, as well as the 26 GHz, 37 GHz and 39 GHz bands. The 28
    GHz band may be used in certain countries by the end of 2018 or early 2019, while
    the other high bands are estimated to be available in late 2019. Low bands below
    1 GHz are of interest due to their favourable radio wave propagation characteristics,
    as they provide coverage in remote areas and into buildings. A new band in the
    600 MHz range is expected to be made available by the end of 2018 for 5G services.
    Part of the mid-bands between 1 GHz and 7 GHz are expected to be allocated in
    several countries. Mid-bands within the 3.3 GHz to 5 GHz range will likely be
    made available around 2020 and are seen as important spectrum resources for terrestrial
    5G access networks. The midbands are particularly beneficial as they offer a favourable
    “middle ground” between propagation characteristics (coverage) and bandwidth (capacity).
    There are several spectrum bands already in use by service providers. In general,
    all the current 3GPP bands including low bands (600 MHz, 700 MHz, 800 MHz, 850
    MHz and 900 MHz) and mid-bands (1.5 GHz, 1.7 GHz, 1.8 GHz, 1.9 GHz, 2.1 GHz, 2.3
    GHz and 2.6 GHz) are being considered for 5G services in the future. These bands,
    and composite arrangements of these bands, will be central to delivering 5G coverage
    and capacity for enhanced mobile broadband, IoT, industrial automation and mission-critical
    business cases, as well as for Public Protection and Disaster Relief (PPDR) services.
    In addition, 3 GPP has recently started a separate Study Item to investigate the
    feasibility of using the 6.5 GHz band (5,925 MHz to 7,125 MHz) for 5G services
    [20]. Frequency ranges being studied for identification at World Radio Communication
    Conference 2019 [95] are presented in Figure 3.22. Figure 3.22 Frequency ranges
    being studied for identification at World Radio Communication Conference 2019
    [95]. IoT applications, based on AR and VR, will revolutionize customer experience
    in gaming, retail shopping and other customer-centric applications. Consumer experience
    will be enhanced by high data rates, while extremely low latencies will be achieved.
    However, these developments are of interest to many industries, including the
    automotive, manufacturing, health, energy and public service sectors. There are
    several factors that could impact commercial adoption of Network Slicing as presented
    in Figure 3.23. The adoption of Network Slicing influences the IoT applications
    and the selection of connectivity solutions. In this context, industry activities
    to standardise Network Slicing should focus on minimising the complexity of the
    technical solution so that adoption can be made relatively easy, the IoT use cases
    need to be defined to drive economies of scale and reduce unitary cost of deployment
    and the operators need to make the cost of deploying Network Slicing marginal
    to the broader investment case for 5G [49]. The development of a critical IoT
    is mainly a business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-business-to-consumer (B2B2C)
    demand, and strongly driven by the digital transformation of vertical industries
    and expanding the traditional cellular technology development (which relies heavily
    on consumer brands). Figure 3.23 Factors that could impact commercial adoption
    of Network Slicing [49]. The global market is thus limited in volume, with market
    estimates according to IDATE of about 60 million units by 2030; but this will
    be compensated by high average revenue per units (ARPUs) as the technology will
    respond to a critical demand in many industries in terms of generating important
    cost reductions and new revenue opportunities. Table 3.2 Vertical industrial sectors

    sector, in which the development of the most advanced autonomous cars will use
    critical IoT capabilities to perform tasks, such as complex intersection control,
    dynamic area management, and cooperative cruise control and platooning. The automotive
    industry is already strongly involved in the standardization process of 5G with
    the set-up of the 5G Automotive Association (5GAA). Other verticals of importance
    include connected health, in which critical IoT capabilities promise the generalization
    of teleoperations and robotics surgery. Manufacturing will also be strongly impacted,
    as critical IoT capabilities are among the building blocks of the smart factory
    (enabling advanced automation and remote control). The key requirements for critical
    IoT communications in different industrial sectors are presented in Table 3.2.
    The 5G use cases can be realized to provide solutions in the B2C, B2B, B2B2X and
    IoT market segments. In B2C market, operators offer the services such as high
    definition video (TV, movies, streaming live sports) or home security solutions
    directly to the end consumers. In B2B market, operators offer the services such
    as mobility solutions and Cloud services to the businesses (SMEs, large corporations)
    where the services are typically consumed by the employees of the business. In
    B2B2X market, the services such as ‘In stadium’ high definition video service
    are offered to businesses like stadium operators and they in turn offer the service
    to their premium customers. In IoT market, operators can leverage the low latency,
    high reliability, high bandwidth and massive connections capabilities to offer
    several vertical industry use cases like connected vehicles, smart utilities and
    remote surgery types of applications by participating in the industry specific
    ecosystems and innovating new business models. Figure 3.24 illustrates the 5G
    applications market potential and readiness matrix presenting the connectivity
    and value-added services opportunities in different sectors [98]. Figure 3.24
    5G Applications Market Potential and Readiness Matrix [100]. Figure 3.25 5G use
    in different industrial application areas. Figure 3.26 Key requirements for connectivity
    for factory of the future automation. Figure 3.27 International Mobile Telecommunications
    system requirements for the year 2020 (IMT-2020) mapped to 5G use cases [95].
    International Mobile Telecommunications system requirements for the year 2020
    mapped to 5G use cases [95] are presented in Figure 3.27. These promising prospects
    are attracting many actors to define their future role in the critical IoT market.
    The capabilities of 5G will indeed lead to more complex value chains with more
    actors providing connectivity and bundling connectivity with vertical specific
    services. It is seen by telecommunication companies as an opportunity to diversify
    and offer vertical specific services, but the rest of the value chain is also
    eager to benefit from new revenue streams: from equipment providers betting on
    small cell networks, to over-the-top (OTT) players looking over unlicensed networks
    or pure vertical players integrating connectivity in their new services. Figure
    3.25 illustrates the use of 5G connectivity in different industrial application
    areas. Industrial sectors will depend on smart wireless technologies like 5G and
    LTE advanced for efficient automation of equipment, predictive maintenance, safety,
    process tracking, smart packing, shipping, logistics and energy management. Smart
    sensor technology offers unlimited solutions for industrial IoT for smarter, safe,
    cost effective and energy efficient industrial operation. A number of key requirements
    for factory of the future automation scenarios for connectivity are presented
    in Figure 3.26. 5G communications could be considered a disruptive element enabling
    the vision of a truly global IoT, given that one of the key features of 5G is
    the focus on the integration of heterogeneous access technologies, including satellite
    communication systems. Satellites could play an important role in providing ubiquitous
    coverage and reliability in remote areas and enabling new IoT services. IoT devices
    are not equipped with satellite connectivity, while IoT protocols are not designed
    with satellite requirements in mind. Thus, cross-layer optimization is required
    to allow the collection of IoT data from satellites, load balance and the oﬄoading
    of terrestrial networks, in turn enabling smooth integration of IoT and satellite
    networks. 5G offers a more reliable network and will deliver a secure network
    for the IIoT by integrating security into the core network architecture. Industrial
    facilities will be among the major users of private 5G networks. Future networks
    have to address the interference between different cells and radiation and develop
    new management models to control roaming, while exploiting the coexistence of
    different cells and radio access technologies. New management protocols controlling
    the user assignment with regard to cells and technology will have to be deployed
    in the mobile core network for better efficiency in accessing the network resource.
    Satellite communications need to be considered as a potential radio access technology,
    especially in remote areas. With the emergence of safety applications, minimizing
    latency and the various protocol translations will benefit end-to-end latency.
    Densification of the mobile network strongly challenges the connection with the
    core network. Future networks should however implement cloud utilization mechanisms
    in order to maximize efficiency in terms of latency, security, energy efficiency
    and accessibility. In this context, there is a need for higher network flexibility,
    which combines cloud technologies with software-defined networks and network function
    virtualization, which will enable network flexibility to integrate new applications
    and configure network resources to an adequate degree (sharing computing resources,
    splitting data traffic, security rules, QoS parameters, mobility etc.). The evolution
    and pervasiveness of present communication technologies have the potential to
    grow to unprecedented levels in the near future by including the Web of Things
    (WoT) into the developing IoT. Network users will be humans, machines and things,
    and groups of them. Figure 3.28 Global number of connected IoT devices [27]. 3.3.3.2
    Communication technology Global connection growth is mainly driven by IoT devices,
    both on the consumer side (e.g., smart home) and on the enterprise/B2B side (e.g.,
    connected machinery). The number of IoT devices that are active is expected to
    grow to 10 billion by 2020 and 22 billion by 2025. Figure 3.28 presents the global
    number of connected IoT devices categorised by the communication/protocol technology
    [27]. These trends require the extension of the spectrum in the 10–100 GHz range
    and unlicensed band and technologies, such as WiGig or 802.11ad, which are mature
    enough for massive deployment and can be used for cell backhaul, point-to-point
    or point-to-multipoint communication. Modular integrated connectivity creates
    a scalable mobile platform (modems for 2G/3G/4GLTE), enabling high-speed data
    and voice and various onboard selected LoRa, Sigfox, On Ramp Wireless, NWave/Weightless
    SIG, 802.11 Wi-Fi/Wi-Fi Aware, Bluetooth, ZigBee, 6LowPAN, Z-Wave, EnOcean, Thread,
    wMBus protocols with the simultaneous use of multiple ISM radio bands (i.e., 169/433/868/902
    MHz, 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz). Connectivity modules are based on integrated circuits
    (ICs), reference designs and feature-rich software stacks created according to
    a flexible modular concept, which properly addresses various application domains.
    The load of the network will differ, with some models using the unbalanced load
    of the ad hoc network from the core network point of view, and others using network-based
    solutions by balancing the topology from the core network point of view. In this
    case, the identified network requirements to be supported are the calculation
    of the optimal ad hoc network topology, by using monitoring information, and the
    notification of appropriate actions. Wireless Personal Area Networks (WPANs) The
    highest number of IoT devices is connected through short-range technology (WPAN),
    which typically does not exceed 100 m in the maximum range. These include Bluetooth-connected
    devices, such as headsets, as well as ZigBee- and Z-Wave-connected devices, which
    can mostly be found in smart homes, e.g., for connecting smoke alarms or thermostats
    [27]. Zigbee 3.0 is a networking solution used on top of IEEE 802.15.4 radio technology,
    which includes Wi-Fi and IP Internet capability. Zigbee 3.0 has meshing capability
    and is used as an IoT connectivity solution for a range of smart home and industrial
    applications, including lighting, security, thermostats and remote controls. It
    is secure and supports battery-free devices, meshing, low latency and energy harvesting
    (e.g., motion, light, piezo, Peltier). Zigbee 3.0 also includes Zigbee Green Power,
    which was developed as an ultra-low-power wireless standard to support energy-harvesting
    IoT devices and is effective for IoT devices that are only sometimes on the network
    (i.e., when they have power), enabling them to go on and off the network securely,
    so they can be off most of the time. 6LowPAN is a network protocol that defines
    encapsulation and header compression mechanisms. The standard has the freedom
    of a frequency band and a physical layer and can also be used across multiple
    communications platforms, including Ethernet, Wi-Fi, 802.15.4 and sub-1 GHz ISM.
    The protocol is implementing open IP standards including TCP, UDP, HTTP, COAP,
    MQTT and web sockets, and offers end-to-end addressable nodes, allowing a router
    to connect the network to IPs. 6LowPAN is a mesh network that is robust, scalable
    and self-healing. Mesh router devices can route data destined for other IoT devices,
    while hosts are able to sleep for long periods of time. Wireless Local Area Networks
    (WLANs) Another large category comprises WLANs, which offer a range of connectivity
    up to 1 km. Wi-Fi is the most common standard in this category and experiencing
    significant growth, mostly through the use of home assistants, smart TVs and smart
    speakers, but also increasingly through use in industrial settings such as factories
    (although it continues to play a minor role in those settings compared to other
    technologies) [27]. With the introduction of Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax standard), the
    connectivity performance is enhanced for the use of IoT devices and businesses
    and operators running large-scale deployments. Wi-Fi 6 brings more capabilities
    to support next generation connectivity uses. Wi-Fi 6 offers faster speeds for
    all devices on the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz spectra, with a raw throughput speed boost
    of as much as 37%. Wi-Fi 6 IoT devices can shut down Wi-Fi connections most of
    the time using the Target Wake Time feature and connect only briefly as scheduled
    in order to transmit data they have gathered since the last time this was performed,
    thus extending battery life. Wi-Fi 6 uses orthogonal frequency-division multiple
    access (OFDMA) to improve the efficiency of multi-user multiple-input, multiple-output
    (MIMO) streams. MIMO works both on the uplink and on the downlink and can simultaneously
    receive data from different devices on different channels (maximum of eight in
    Wi-Fi 6) at once. The Target Wake Time feature improves sleep and wake efficiency,
    reduces power consumption and decreases congestion on crowded networks. In Wi-Fi
    6, the theoretical maximum bandwidth of a single stream is 3.5 Gbit/s, and up
    to four streams can be delivered to a single device, which means a maximum of
    up to 14 Gbit/s. Low-Power Wide Area Networks (LPWANs) A large chunk of the future
    growth in the number of IoT devices is expected to come from LPWANs. By 2025,
    it is expected that more than two billion devices will be connected through LPWANs.
    The technology, which promises extremely high battery life and a maximum communication
    range of over 20 kilometres, is used by the three main competing standards, LoRa,
    Sigfox and NB-IoT, which are currently being rolled out worldwide with more than
    25 million devices already connected to date, the majority of which are smart
    meters [27]. Another research report predicts that there will be 2.7 billion LPWAN
    IoT connections by 2029 [28]. LPWANs operate in the unlicensed industrial, scientific
    and medical (ISM) spectrum at 900 MHZ, 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz. LoRa is the standard
    protocol of the LoRa Alliance (open, non-profit association established in 2015
    with more than 500 members). LoRa has a bandwidth of 250 kHz and 125 kHz and a
    maximum data rate of 50 Kbps, enabling bidirectional communication albeit not
    simultaneously, and has a maximum payload of 243 bytes. The range is up to 5 km
    in urban areas and 20 km in rural areas depending on the application. There are
    around 50 million LoRa-based end nodes and 70,000 LoRa gateways that have already
    been deployed worldwide [29]. LoRa networks use gateway devices to work and manage
    the network for connecting IoT devices. Sigfox operates and commercializes its
    own proprietary communications technology, which is an ultra-narrowband (100 Hz)
    with a maximum data rate of 100 bps. It also operates in the unlicensed ISM spectrum
    and its small payload (maximum 12 bytes) means it can offer greater coverage geographically,
    reaching up to 10 km in urban areas and 40 km in rural areas. Sigfox offers bidirectional
    connections, with the downlink from base stations to end IoT devices occurring
    following uplink communication. The daily uplink messages are limited to 140.
    Weightless (Weightless-N, Weightless-W and Weightless-P) operates in the unlicensed
    spectrum and is an open standard (Weightless SIG) designed to operate in a variety
    of bands, with all the unlicensed sub-GHz ISM bands, while featuring a 100 kbps
    maximum data rate on uplink and downlink. Weightless can handle 2,769 end points
    per base station on standard smart meter set-ups (200 bytes uploaded every 15
    min). NB-IoT coexists with GSM and LTE and is a 3GPP LTE standard, based on licensed
    cellular networks providing a 200 kHz bandwidth and a 200 kbps maximum data rate,
    which offers bidirectional communication, albeit not simultaneously, and has unlimited
    messages with a maximum payload 1,600 bytes. The global shipments of NB-IoT devices
    will have a compound annual growth rate of 41.8% from 106.9 million units in 2018
    to 613.2 million in 2023 [30]. LTE-M is another 3GPP providing extended coverage
    by using an installed LTE base with the same spectrum, radios and base stations.
    It is implemented as a 4G technology with an important role in 5G. The uplink/downlink
    transfers 1 Mbps and, due to low latency and full duplex operation, can carry
    voice traffic. LTE-M supports more demanding IoT mobile devices, which require
    real-time data transfer (e.g., transport, wearable), while NB-IoT supports more
    IoT static sensors and devices. Cellular and non-cellular LPWA network connections
    will grow globally at a 53% CAGR until 2023, driven by market growth in smart
    meters and asset trackers. In 2017, smart meters and asset trackers contributed
    to almost three quarters of all LPWA network connections, dominated by non-cellular
    LPWA network technologies. By 2023, non-cellular LPWA will cede its market-share
    dominance to NB-IoT and LTE-M, as cellular LPWA moves to capture over 55% of LPWA
    connections. Private LPWA networks, built to address a single vertical application
    or an individual enterprise, have been popular choices for over a decade and accounted
    for 93% of LPWA connections in 2017. LoRa and other non-cellular LPWA technologies
    have benefited from the decreasing cost of ICs, low implementation costs and flexibility
    of private networks, which can be tailored to meet specific enterprise IoT applications.
    As the geographic footprint of public networks rapidly expands, cellular and non-cellular
    public networks will capture over 70% of LPWA connections by 2023 [31]. Future
    IoT devices will require network agnostic solutions that integrate mobile, NB-IoT,
    LoRa, Sigfox, Weightless etc. and high-speed wireless networks (Wi-Fi), particularly
    for applications spanning multiple jurisdictions. LPWA networks have several features
    that make them particularly attractive for IoT devices and applications, which
    require low mobility and low levels of data transfer: Low power consumption that
    enable devices to last up to 10 years on a single charge Optimized data transfer
    that supports small, intermittent blocks of data Low device unit costs Few base
    stations required to provide coverage Easy installation of the network Dedicated
    network authentication Optimized for low throughput, long or short distance Sufficient
    indoor penetration and coverage Wired Few people think of wired connections when
    they think of the IoT. In many settings, a wired device connection is still the
    most reliable option that provides very high data rates at very low cost, albeit
    without much mobility. Particularly in industrial settings, fieldbus and Ethernet
    technologies use wired connections to a large extent, and it is expected that
    they will continue to do so in the future [27]. Sensor/actuator units that are
    installed within a building automation system can use wired networking technologies
    like Ethernet. Power Line Communication (PLC) is a hard-wired solution that uses
    existing electrical wiring instead of dedicated network cables and for industrial
    applications has significant advances. According to the frequency bands allocated
    for operation PLC systems can be divided into narrowband PLC (NBPLC), and broadband
    PLC (BPLC). NBPLC refers to low bandwidth communication, utilising the frequency
    band below 500 kHz and providing data rates of tens of kpbs, while BPLC utilises
    a wider frequency band, typically between 2 MHz and 30 MHz, and allows for data
    rates of hundreds of Mbps. BPLC is recommended for smart home applications requiring
    high-speed data transfer applications like Internet, HDTV, and audio, while the
    use of NBPLC systems is more appropriate for remote data acquisition, automatic
    measuring systems, renewable energy generation, advanced metering, street lighting,
    plug-in electric vehicles, etc. BPLC has higher speed, that reduce the data collection
    period and ensures a real-time remote-control command, but its stability and reliability
    are still determined by the quality of power lines. Another way to classify PLC
    is as PLC over AC lines and PLC over DC lines. Most companies are currently providing
    AC-PLC solutions, PLC in DC lines also has applications for distributed energy
    generation, and transportation (electronic controls in airplanes, automobiles
    and trains). Cellular / M2M 2G, 3G and 4G technology, for a long time, were the
    only option for remote device connectivity. As LPWA and also 5G gain momentum,
    it is expected that these legacy cellular standards will cede their share to new
    technologies as they present a more lucrative opportunity to many end users [27].
    5G 5G is under development and the technology, which promises a new era of connectivity
    through its massive bandwidth and extremely low latency, is now heavily promoted
    by governments, particularly China. The Chinese government views 5G adoption as
    a competitive asset in the quest to move the equilibrium of technological innovation
    from the US and Europe towards China. In the US, the first pre-standard 5G networks
    will provide fixed wireless access (FWA) services to residential and small business
    users by the end of this year. While many more use cases will be targeted once
    the final standard is ratified in 2020, we should already see first adopters next
    year and expect quick growth from there [27]. 5G includes two of the tree scenarios,
    massive machine type communications (mMTC) and ultra-reliable and low latency
    communications (URLLC), which support IoT applications for industries with available,
    ultra-low latency links for next generation IoT services. The Internet as network
    technology is focusing on the internet working among underlay technologies in
    order to provide end-to-end services. Telecoms/communication and Internet/computer
    communication are converging via telephone/cellular and Internet/data networks.
    The TCP/IP paradigm started as an overlay of network technologies, while TCP/IP
    is nowadays integrated in pre-existent network infrastructures and starting to
    include transport and application functionality in the network as well. 5G is
    including the wired/core section of the network, as well as LANs, to architecturally
    integrate cloud/fog/edge systems, based on software network functions, providing
    differentiated service support. The next generation Internet and 5G are converging
    into a fully integrated interoperable network, where people and IoT physical,
    digital and virtual devices interact in real-time. 5G connectivity is one important
    element in building real-time interactive systems and implementing a tactile IoT/IIoT
    in order to provide the communication infrastructure with low latency, very short
    transit time, high availability, reliability and security. LTE evolution will
    continue, while LTE and 5G will co-exist in upcoming years. The availability of
    device hardware and attractive service pricing will influence the adoption of
    5G for various IoT applications across different industrial sectors. 5G monetization
    is a critical success factor for the deployment of 5G and monetization models
    must be supported by different pricing models. Some of the monetization models
    to be considered are [98]: Monetize network, infrastructure and business services
    by leveraging the network and infrastructure capabilities: Operators provide services
    such as Network as a Service, Information broadcasting, Cloud services with high
    QoS that attract premium in B2B segments. Operators become platform providers
    for a variety of micro-services, assuring low latency where needed by providing
    them on the edge. With this model, application developers and vendors could simply
    define how they want their applications to perform and let the connectivity provider
    make it happen. Operators enable the developers to monetize their applications
    that connect to many millions of devices and in turn will be able to secure revenues
    from developers and the end users of these devices. Leveraging the infrastructure,
    vertical industrial solutions can be offered by establishing ecosystems with complex
    partnerships and revenue sharing models. Key for success is to make the economics
    work for both the operators and other participants in the ecosystem to bring useful
    solutions to the market quickly. Monetize value: 5G creates opportunity for operators
    to monetize the ‘value’ created by services with revenue sharing type of models
    rather than being simply the connectivity provider. Applications such as translation
    services, home automation can be monetized by putting compute functionality on
    the ultra-low latency edge networks and thus putting it on the Cloud without compromising
    on latency. Advertisements in the new digital services like high definition content
    offers new monetization opportunities for operators. Data monetization: Operators
    have access to customer data – customer priorities and interactions, network data
    – usage, pattern, massive number of device related data. This massive amount of
    data along with data analytics creates new opportunities for operators to monetize
    insights. Wireless Neighbourhood Area Networks (WNANs) WNANs sit between WLAN
    and long-range technologies, such as cellular, in terms of communication range.
    Typical proponents of this technology include mesh networks such as Wi-SUN or
    JupiterMesh. In some cases, the technology is used as an alternative to LPWA/cellular
    (e.g., in utilities’ field area networks) and in other cases such as a complementary
    element (e.g., for deep indoor metering where nothing else reaches) [27]. Wi-SUN
    is an open standards-based field area network (FAN) used for the IoT and can support
    applications such as advanced metering infrastructure, distribution automation,
    intelligent transport and traffic systems, street lighting, and smart home automation.
    The suite of IoT technologies is based on IEEE 802.15.4, TCP/IP and related standard
    protocols with a bandwidth of up to 300 kbps, a low latency of 20 ms, power efficiency
    (less than 2 mA when resting; 8 mA when listening), resilience, scalability (networks
    to 5,000 devices; 10 million end points worldwide) and using security mechanisms
    based on public key certificates, AES, HMAC, dynamic key refresh and hardened
    crypto. The PHY layer is based on IEEE 802.15.4g, which provides bidirectional
    communication. The network layer is IPv6 with 6LoWPAN adaptation supporting star
    and mesh topologies, as well as hybrid star/mesh deployments. These different
    types of networks are needed to address IoT products, services and techniques
    so as to improve the grade of service (GoS), quality of service and quality of
    experience (QoE) for end users. Customization-based solutions are addressing the
    IIoT while moving to a managed wide-area communications system and ecosystem collaboration.
    Intelligent gateways will be needed at lower cost to simplify the infrastructure
    complexity for end consumers, enterprises and industrial environments. Multifunctional,
    multiprotocol processing gateways are likely to be deployed for IoT devices and
    combined with Internet protocols and different communication protocols. These
    different approaches show that device interoperability and open standards are
    key considerations in the design and development of internet-worked IoT systems.
    Ensuring the security, reliability, resilience and stability of Internet applications
    and services is critical to promoting the concept of a trusted IoT, based on the
    features and security provided by devices at various levels of the digital value
    chain. 3.3.4 Distributed Ledger Technology/Blockchain Technology A distributed
    ledger is a record of transactions or data that is maintained in a decentralized
    form across different systems, locations, organizations or devices. It allows
    data or funds to be effectively sent between parties in the form of peer-to-peer
    transfers without relying on any centralized authority to broker the transfer.
    A distributed consensus mechanism allows members of the network (nodes) to establish
    a common “truth”. There are different mechanisms for this: in the case of Bitcoin
    and other “cryptocurrencies”, a computationally complex “proof-of-work” algorithm
    is used to protect the integrity of the network against change to the public “blockchain”
    by making it impractical for malevolent players to alter the chain. Whilst Bitcoin
    operates on a public blockchain, there is also the possibility to operate distributed
    ledgers privately where network participants are provided with relevant permissions
    to either read or write to (i.e., append) the ledger [33, 34]. Blockchain is a
    technological disruption in secured infrastructures. It is based on a combination
    of encrypted algorithms and duplicated data storage on a network of computers.
    Used as a secured infrastructure, it can meet the demand for security from various
    industries. From a technological perspective, blockchain is a data storage infrastructure
    technology. It makes it possible to store data securely (each entry is authenticated,
    irreversible and duplicated), with decentralized control: there is no central
    authority that controls the information on the chain. This is achieved using encryption
    technologies (hash function and asymmetric cryptography) and a computer network
    of independent nodes. Blockchain technologies were initially designed to be used
    with the Bitcoin cryptocurrency, where they were employed to create a reliable
    ledger of all financial transactions. But blockchain technology is also developing
    in ways that are opening new prospects: The use of blockchains as a ledger of
    transactions (the initial use case) The use of blockchains to accurately archive
    and date important pieces of information The introduction of smart contracts:
    automated conditional transactions that are executed without human intervention
    or the involvement of a trusted third party The advent of decentralized applications:
    applications that use the blockchain as their execution infrastructure, without
    a centralized IT platform The information architecture used by Bitcoin technology
    provides a source for the development, contextualization, exchange and distributed
    security of data needed for the IoT. Blockchains for the IoT transform the way
    business transactions are conducted globally within a trustworthy environment
    to automate and encode business transactions while preserving enterprise-level
    privacy and security for all parties in the transaction. Blockchain solutions
    are, for instance, being developed to identify IoT objects and to sign automatic
    and decentralized contracts between connected devices. The benefits of blockchains
    for the IoT are providing mechanisms for building trust between stakeholders in
    an IoT application and IoT devices with blockchain cryptography, to reduce the
    risk of collusion and tampering, to facilitate cost reductions by removing the
    overheads associated with middlemen and intermediaries, and to accelerate transactions
    by reducing the settlement time from days to almost real-time. Considerations
    in the application of distributed ledgers for the IoT include addressing the storage
    space, the computing power of the devices, security, communication power, transaction
    confirmation time, consensus mechanisms, congestions, costs/fees and price volatility.
    IoT applications using distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) must evaluate several
    attributes regarding the implementation of use cases, which must take into account
    the retention in the distributed ledger, multiparty sharing needs, the trade-off
    between retrieval and flexibility performance for the ledger database features
    and the trade-off in real-time, as there is a time lapse between the moment when
    data or transactions are generated and when the consensus mechanism confirms that
    the information is part of the ledger. The evolution of the blockchain is illustrated
    in Figure 3.29. Figure 3.29 Evolution of the blockchain. Source: Adapted from
    IDATE DigiWorld, Blockchain, October 2016. IoT devices will be used in building
    blockchain-based solutions to support applications aimed at improving operational
    efficiency, transforming the user experience and adopting new business models
    in a secure, private and decentralised manner, so that all stakeholders benefit.
    This is especially the case for blockchain applications that can track and control
    property: from asset management applications (IoT devices being used to track
    assets along the logistics chain) to a radical transformation of business relationships,
    transitioning to a world where any property or object can easily be rented out
    to another user securely and without the need to interact directly with the user
    (the user signs a smart rental contract, which, once the payment has been made,
    gives him/her access to the lock for a set period of time). The IoT can make use
    of blockchain-based computing platforms (e.g., iExec, Golem, Sonm, Hypernet, Ripple)
    or Hyperledger, which is an open source Linux Foundation platform. Recently, the
    Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, a blockchain standards organization, and Hyperledger
    announced that they have joined each other’s groups [22, 23]. Other solutions
    offered by Ripple, BigchainDB and Sovrin exist [37–39]. The Hyperledger platform
    [22, 24] connects data from the IoT via specific adapters in order to integrate
    a variety of existing sensors and protocols, as well as integrate and connect
    transactions that are related to these sensors with blockchain systems that might
    belong to different stakeholders. The platform allows for the use of cognitive
    artificial intelligence (AI) components to infer new insights from these combined
    data. Further research is needed to define how to optimally combine blockchains,
    cognitive AI and the IoT for various industry domains. Figure 3.30 Combining blockchain
    technology and the IoT with the use of IBM Watson and blockchain platforms [41].
    Figure 3.31 Using blockchain and the IoT to improve operations in the aviation
    industry [40]. Combinations of blockchain technology and the IoT into an IoT-driven
    blockchain, as used in the aviation industry, are presented in [40, 41] (see Figures
    3.30 and 3.31). The combination of blockchains and the IoT provides several benefits
    in supply chains such as: tracking objects as they travel along the export/import
    supply chain, while enforcing shipping and lines of credit contracts and expediting
    incremental payments; maintaining an indelible history of parts and end assembly
    through supply chains, potentially including critical events that affect life
    or scheduled maintenance; providing decentralized edge computing to securely run
    computing workloads, such as analytics, on edge devices owned by third parties;
    interconnecting IoT devices by allowing distributed devices to request and pay
    for services through distributed role management and micropayments, as well as
    regulatory compliance, in order to track equipment or process history in an indelible
    record, and enabling easy sharing of this information with regulatory agencies
    or insurers [41]. IOTA is a next generation blockchain focused on use in the IoT
    as a “ledger of things”. IOTA uses a revised distributed ledger design known as
    a “tangle”, which aims to be massively scalable as well as avoid the cost of replicating
    all data to all nodes [35, 36]. Hypernet is proposing new architecture and has
    implemented a new programming model beneath the blockchain layer to handle distributed
    computation problems, which require inter process communication. Hypernet is based
    on the principle of distributed average consensus (DAC), and the combination with
    blockchains allows for the efficient distribution of compute jobs, while effectively
    managing processing units in dropping on and off the network. The platform creates
    a secure backbone, where buyers and providers of computational power can engage,
    based on trust. The on-chain (scheduled) and off-chain (DAC) technology layers
    of Hypernet fit together, with both driven by consensus. Golem, iExec and Sonm
    have built their concept on traditional computing architectures developed specifically
    to be used in data centres. These data centre architectures pose challenges to
    a distributed network used in the IoT as the amount of network communication and
    data transfer overhead is very high and the architectures do not tolerate computers
    randomly dropping in and out of the network. As data centre architectures are
    optimised for one particular topology, they cannot be used on a distributed network,
    as the network topology is unknown. Blockchain-based systems require devices in
    the blockchain to have the resources run the blockchain software and process blockchain
    data. However, distributed ledgers are open, with devices connected to a distributed
    ledger known as “nodes”. Each “block” within the ledger has a maximum size of
    1 MB and IoT devices used to hold a full copy of the ledger need to have processing
    and storage capabilities necessary to hold at least a few “full nodes” containing
    the complete ledger. IoT security issues are relevant when using blockchain technology,
    as there is a need for proper security credentials to view a transaction and IoT
    device commissioning and secure key management are challenging issues in the case
    of IoT devices. Addressing and solving the limitations of blockchain technology
    in the future could allow for the integration of blockchain-based platforms for
    the IoT. Furthermore, considering that a blockchain contains the transaction and
    can also contain the contract, the IoT device can process financial information,
    buying/selling data from/to another IoT device or system, which could produce
    a transactional system less prone to the problems of resilience. The blockchain
    model has several limitations for the use with IoT devices as blockchain processing
    tasks are computationally intensive and timeconsuming, while IoT devices have
    limited processing and storage resources to directly participate in a blockchain.
    Lower-end IoT edge devices with limited storage space, communications bandwidth
    and processing power are not especially suitable to support resource-intensive
    distributed ledgers but can utilize the services of a distributed ledger network
    (e.g., by using an API). IoT gateway devices, such as an IoT home gateway, could
    potentially support blockchains (e.g., Raspberry Pi as a “full node”). The requirement
    for large amounts of disk storage adds cost and complexity, making it more likely
    that this would be reserved for higher-end gateway products. Lower-end IoT gateways
    and connections with limited bandwidth are more likely to access the distributed
    ledger network using an API. High-end IoT edge nodes, such as industrial controllers,
    smart building controllers and enterprise systems should be able to run capable
    distributed ledger solutions. Maintaining a local copy of the distributed ledger
    provides for local high-performance access to the data held on the ledger, as
    well as continuity in the case that connectivity to the Internet may be disrupted.
    IoT mobile edge computing nodes (i.e., deployed in the carrier network) can be
    used to build new distributed ledger solutions typically offered by telecoms operators
    to enterprise customers as a permissioned distributed ledger [33]. The research
    challenges for implementing DLTs and blockchains at the edge of networks for IoT
    applications are as follows: Techniques for increased scalability, as DLTs and
    blockchains do no scale as required by IoT applications for use in a distributed
    system. Solutions for dealing with the required processing power, as IoT devices
    do not have the processing and storage capabilities required to perform encryption
    for all the objects involved in a blockchain-based ecosystem. Connecting large
    numbers of IoT devices requires large volumes and very low cost, while the majority
    of these IoT devices are not capable of running the required encryption algorithms
    at the desired speed. Techniques to speed up the process of validating the transactions
    for IoT devices. Storage capabilities (e.g., internal flash memory or external
    NOR or NAND flash) to be used to store transactions and device IDs, as well as
    the ledger on the nodes as the ledger increases in size as time passes. Addressing
    the complexities of the convergence of DLTs, blockchains and IoT technologies
    and providing simpler implementations at the system level. Interoperability issues
    when combining data sources from different applications, while considering the
    lack of data model standards for industrial vertical markets. Legal and compliance
    issues for hybrid transactions management across different industrial sectors.

    businesses, applications and services are scaling up and going through various
    digital transformations in order to deliver value for money and remain competitive.
    In this context, they are becoming increasingly vulnerable to disruption from
    denial-of-service attacks, identity theft, data tampering and other threats. Emerging
    distributed end-to-end security technologies enhance the ability of an IoT ecosystem
    and its devices to exhibit complex behaviour independently or collectively in
    the presence of threats, in a pursuit to achieving end-to-end security. By using
    such technologies as blockchain, swarm logic and AI, IoT can offer security by
    design and end-to-end security solutions never implemented before. Techniques
    such as simulation and optimisation allow for the integration of security early
    in the design, where a diversity of security breach scenarios can be tested and
    guarded before they occur in real life. Interoperability, scalability and security
    are three of the most essential attributes of IoT environments and ecosystems,
    which are absent or not fully addressed in today’s architectures. Several technologies
    have succeeded in offering sound and complete solutions to these matters, although
    not without challenges still remaining. A new 3D IoT layered architecture capturing
    the IoT systems functions and cross-cutting functions is presented in Figure 3.32.
    Among them, blockchain technology has been developed for scale and with interoperability
    in mind; hence, it is often generalized as DLT. Its security mechanism, based
    on public ledger and consensus, is applied across the stack and the network, whether
    this is centralized, decentralized or distributed. Nevertheless, in spite of all
    security advancements, guarding against single scenarios of fraud, hacking and
    other breaches still remains a challenge. Different IoT topologies require different
    security configurations and strategies, and this is especially true at the edges,
    where devices can be diverse, less traditional, small and possibly out of reach
    for security updates. The edges are therefore vulnerable, providing entry points
    for malicious attacks, which are difficult to track and therefore easily propagate
    throughout the whole IoT ecosystem. Figure 3.32 3D IoT Layered Architecture. As
    edge devices are often unsophisticated devices, it may be difficult to build security
    into the design. However, it is here that swarm technology may come to the rescue.
    Edge devices may form clusters, where they collaborate and share resources and
    functions in the presence of perceived danger. Each edge device, now belonging
    to a cluster, will exhibit collective intelligence and be able to evolve and adapt
    to new requirements and threat situations. Swarm technology helps to identify
    the threat and define its landscape. In the evolving IoT market, security goes
    beyond securing the information exchanged among the IoT nodes. The entire operation
    of an IoT ecosystem depends on protection at all levels, from single devices to
    communications. Moreover, devices must exhibit a high level of resilience against
    a growing range of attacks, including hardware, software and physical tampering.
    Security is therefore critical to IoT technologies and applications, and end-to-end
    security is essential to enabling the implementation of trustworthy IoT solutions
    for all stakeholders in IoT ecosystems and IoT value networks to enable the development,
    deployment and maintenance of systems in IoT applications and provide a common
    framework to enable the growth of IoT value network solutions. The standard security
    services that are valid for the Internet framework and technology, such as authentication,
    confidentiality, integrity, non-repudiation, access control and availability,
    should be extended to also apply to IoT technologies but adapted with their particularities
    and constraints in mind. Identification: is the act of allowing a device or service
    to be specifically and uniquely identified without ambiguity. This may take the
    form of RFID tag identifiers, IP addresses, global unique identifiers, functional
    or capability identifiers, or data source identifiers. Authentication: is the
    act of confirming the truth of an attribute of an entity or a single piece of
    data by using passwords, PINs, smart cards, digital certificates, or biometrics
    to sign in. In contrast with Identification, Authentication is the process of
    actually confirming the Identity of a device or confirming that data arriving
    or leaving are genuine and have not been tampered with or forged. Authorization:
    is the function of specifying access rights to resources and ensuring that any
    request for data or control of a system is managed within these policies. Authorization
    mechanisms tend to be centralized, which may be a challenge in IoT systems that
    tend to be increasingly decentralized, without an authority involved. Whatever
    the degree of democratized authorization, where more entities can grant permissions,
    the authorization system must be consistent, persistent and attack resistant.
    Availability: has two definitions within the IoT domain. Firstly, as with mainstream
    Information Assurance, the system must provide data and resources in a timely
    manner for a set percentage of the time (e.g. 99.99% uptime availability). Secondly,
    in the IoT it is critical that many devices are available or retain their critical
    functionality, even if the system has undergone an attack. Confidentiality: is
    a set functionality that limits access or places restrictions on certain types
    of information, with the goal of preventing unauthorized access. Confidentiality
    is usually achieved through encryption and cryptographic mechanisms and is essential
    within an IoT ecosystem where a large amount of information is exchanged among
    the nodes. Integrity: is a critical measure in information assurance and is defined
    as providing consistency or a lack of corruption within the IoT system. It requires
    the final information received to correspond with the original information sent
    and that data cannot be modified without detection. Malicious modification of
    the information exchanged may disrupt the correct functioning of an entire IoT
    ecosystem. Non-repudiation: is an aspect of authentication that enables systems
    to have a high level of mathematical confidence that data, including identifiers,
    are genuine. This ensures that either a transmitting or receiving party cannot
    later deny that the request occurred (cannot later “repudiate”) and provides data
    integrity around the system. This is of particular importance in terms of tracking
    illegal activities within an IoT system, as it allows for accountability to be
    enforced. Whether Non-repudiation needs to be enforced under certain circumstances
    will depend on the particular applications. A Root of Trust: is an immutable boot
    process within an IoT system based on unique identifiers, cryptographic keys and
    on-chip memory, to protect the device from being compromised at the most fundamental
    level. The Chain of Trust extends the Root of Trust into subsequent applications
    and use cases. Given that IoT systems rely on a large number of devices that collect
    and process information, it is paramount to ensure their credibility so that they
    are honest and leverage correct outputs. Secure Update: enables IoT systems and
    devices to install new firmware from authorized sources without the firmware being
    compromised. Software updates are critical processes and are susceptible to a
    number of threats and attacks. During an update, the device receives the firmware
    wirelessly and installs it, removing the previous version. However, to reassure
    that the process is being done properly and securely, the sender of the firmware
    should be verified as trusted, the firmware should be validated as not compromised,
    the initial security keys should be protected, etc. Additionally, depending on
    the services that the device offers, the downtime during a firmware update may
    need to be kept at a minimum. If not properly protected, devices may be open to
    manipulation, typically through the installation of malicious code on a device.
    3.5 IoT/IIoT Technology Market Developments IoT/IIoT components, communication,
    systems, platforms, solutions applications and services markets are developing
    steadily, posing new challenges for research and innovation concerning IoT technologies
    addressing next generation developments. The IoT chip market is expected to register
    a CAGR of over 13.68% during the forecast period of 2018–2023. The report profiles
    end user segments (such as healthcare, building automation and automotive segments)
    in the IoT chip market in various regions. Chipsets designed for IoT systems have
    unique factors including the need for optimal energy efficiency. The network effect
    is clearly evident as the impact of increasingly interconnected IoT systems will
    cause an acceleration in overall demand for chipsets due to the interdependency
    of platforms, gateways and devices [26]. The number of connected devices that
    are in use worldwide now exceeds 17 billion, with the number of IoT devices at
    seven billion (not including smartphones, tablets, laptops or fixed-line phones).
    Global connection growth is mainly driven by IoT devices – both on the consumer
    side (e.g., smart home) and on the enterprise/B2B side (e.g., connected machinery).
    The number of IoT devices that are active is expected to grow to 10 billion by
    2020 and 22 billion by 2025 (see Figure 3.33). The global market for IoT (end
    user spending on IoT solutions) is expected to grow by 37% from 2017 to $151 billion.
    Due to the market acceleration regarding the IoT, those estimates have been revised
    upwards and it is now expected that the total market will reach $1,567 billion
    by 2025. Software and platforms are expected to continue to drive the market as
    more data are moved to the cloud, new IoT applications are brought to market,
    and analytics continue to gain in importance [27]. Figure 3.33 Total number of
    active device connections worldwide [27]. 3.5.1 Digital Business Model Innovation
    and IoT as a Driver The growing digitisation of businesses as well as societies
    has facilitated an increase in the amount of data made available and to be adopted
    and explored in the development of businesses. Digitisation is creating a second
    economy that is vast, automatic and invisible – thereby bringing the biggest change
    since the Industrial Revolution [1]. Data has become massive and has moved from
    static data to real-time data streams created by the IoT based on a large number
    of transactions of millions of sensors and devices across the ecosystems of many
    organizations, even now moving from the central paradigm of the cloud more and
    more towards the edge in a distributed manner [2]. Some studies estimate an increase
    in annually created, replicated and consumed data from around 1,200 exabytes in
    2010 to 40,000 in 2020 [3], with a growing proportion of data generated and consumed
    by machines [3]. In businesses, IoT data can be applied, for instance, to target
    customers more effectively; make better pricing decisions; predict failures; and
    optimise the use of assets, production or logistics. To fully exploit IoT in business
    we need to understand how businesses integrate technology [2]. 3.5.1.1 Business
    models and business model innovation Business models are intended to make sense
    of how businesses work. Business models are abstracted in different ways in the
    literature. Business models are discussed in [6] as a narrative that describes
    the customer, customer value, revenue collection of the model and the delivery
    of this value. Another level of abstraction is presented in [11]. In this reference
    the business model is described as an archetype of 55 different business model
    building blocks that can be combined in various ways to accommodate the business
    model in which the business operates. The most popular and most adopted break-through
    on another level of abstraction is the graphical framework. The most widely adopted
    graphical framework is the Business Model Canvas presented in [10]. The business
    model literature points to the fact that the technological development of the
    Internet and recent developments of ICT has boosted the usage of the business
    model concept and innovation in general. According to [9] in the context of innovation,
    the term Business Models is used to either commercialize new technology or ideas
    and as a source of innovation to the business model itself, that can lead to a
    competitive advantage. Figure 3.34 The importance of Business Model Innovation
    with respect to external changes in the environment. The use and importance of
    business model innovation is stated in [12] and illustrated in Figure 3.34: Business
    Model Innovation will continue to become increasingly important for ensuring sustained
    competitiveness of both large and small businesses. Business Model Innovation
    is expected to serve as a facilitator of new market exploration and an important
    source of competitive advantage. Continuous adaptation of business models is imperative
    to ensure organizational fit with the environment. However, there are significant
    research gaps combining technology trends with business model innovation: Empirical
    evidence remains patchy and often builds on observations of businesses that have
    successfully implemented new business models without knowing how the innovation
    has been created in the first place. Business Model Innovation frameworks are
    technology agnostic and often abstract the complexity of ecosystems, technology
    development/operations and organisations challenges. 3.5.1.2 The use of IoT for
    digital business development IoT and digital technologies are central for digital
    business development and the disruptive business innovation tendencies of this
    decade and probably also decades to come. Consequently, Nambisan et al. [4] conceptualise
    digital innovation as “the creation of (and consequent change in) market offerings,
    business processes, or models that result from the use of digital technologies”
    and therefore, digital innovation management refers to the “practices, processes,
    and principles that underlie the effective orchestration of digital innovation”.
    Thus, we need to examine how different company types, industries and sectors apply
    digital technologies to design digital businesses and digital business models.
    3.5.1.3 The design and implementation processes of digital business development
    Through digitisation of the business functions through IoT, data can be provided
    to enhance and develop each of these functions and thus the entire value chain.
    In practice this is demonstrated in the dramatic change of the marketing functions
    focus on online, social media and mobile marketing and less of a focus on traditional
    advertising, thus creating stronger interactions and continuous data collections
    with customers through social networks. Through the online environment, assortment
    and pricing decisions is made easier and much more flexible. Logistics and logistics
    streams are key to competitive delivery and services, and the marketing and logistic
    functions therefore need to cooperate more effectively in order to deliver superior
    customer value, and at a lower and more competitive cost [2]. With standards to
    represent different forms of data (text, numbers, pictures and video) facilitating
    communication via Bluetooth and the internet has led to the evolution of new products
    and services, and thus data has become a commodity. Thus, we need to explore the
    specific processes that go into the adoption and implementation of digital business
    development viewed from both a business and technology angle. The effect and business
    opportunities of digitisation across ecosystems. Digitisation affects entire ecosystems,
    their business models and the underlying business functions of a company’s value
    chain. With intelligent devices becoming interconnected in IoT, new developments
    have created associated infrastructure and an expanding knowledge base, and these
    innovative combinations are being reflected in enterprises’ “digital” business
    models [5]. Thus, we need to examine which metric and measurement systems are
    applied and require development to better assess the tangible as well as intangible
    value creation and capture of digital business development. How technology, organisation
    and business interact is still poorly understood. Most studies have focussed on
    successful businesses and have been conducted within a discipline like business,
    innovation, technology or organisation. The literature provides some patchy evidence
    which shows Business Model Innovation (BMI) as a cross-disciplinary activity,
    connected with technology. It is also clear that IoT is a strong driver for business
    development and digitisation in industry, with many new applications and services
    emerging and driving new business models. We call for more concerted efforts to
    link business and technology at the applied research level and to devise new methods
    of studying IoT. Acknowledgments The IoT European Research Cluster – European

    SA, Spain Abstract The chapter aims at describing the cybersecurity and privacy
    methodologies and solutions that the architecture defined in the ACTIVAGE Large-Scale
    Pilot, and the corresponding implementation in nine Deployment sites should follow
    to secure the IoT system and protect the personal data from potential malicious
    cyber-attacks and threats. It further presents common definitions, methods and
    repeatable processes to analyse and address all potential threats in terms of
    cybersecurity and privacy that might occur during the exploitation phase of the
    project. 4.1 Introduction The Internet and mobile revolution have transformed
    our world. The Internet of Things (IoT) has significantly emerged over the last
    few years, aiming to change our lives by forming a massive ecosystem where interconnected
    devices and services collect, exchange and process data in order to adapt dynamically
    to a context to offer a variety of services. By 2020, market analysts expect between
    20 and 50 billion connected devices in the world. With all the benefits originating
    from the use of IoT technology, also come a range of ever-increasing challenges
    and security threats including data manipulation, data theft, and cyber-attacks.
    For instance, the ransomware landscape has dramatically shifted in 2017 and organizations
    bore the brunt of the damage caused by new, self-propagating threats such as WannaCry
    and Petya. Most recently, a report from Symantec ISTR [1] revealed that there
    were 470 thousand ransomware infections in 2016 and 319 thousand in the first-half
    of 2017. The threats and risks related to the Internet of Things devices, systems
    and services are of manifold and they evolve rapidly. With a great impact on citizens’
    safety, security and privacy, the threat landscape concerning the Internet of
    Things is extremely wide and evolves rapidly. Hence, it is important to understand
    what needs to be secured to develop sophisticated security measures to protect
    the IoT infrastructure. Information (or data) lies at the heart of an IoT system,
    feeding into a continuous cycle of sensing, decision-making, and actions. The
    billions of “things” can be the target of intrusions and interferences that might
    dramatically jeopardize personal privacy. Since IoT is seen as a key enabler for
    creating new services and improving overall quality of life, consumers need to
    have trust and confidence about their data being secured and protected, therefore,
    making the cybersecurity of IoT systems an essential part. Currently, there are
    no official guidelines available for trust of IoT devices, in addition, there
    is no regulatory compliance defined for minimum-security requirements. Despite
    the existence of many security guidelines in general, the literature lacks primary
    guidelines to help adopt security measures and standards for the IoT systems.
    The European Union (EU) is working on several fronts to promote cyber resilience
    across the EU. It published several proposals in a ‘cybersecurity package’ in
    September 2017 [2]. Furthermore, the EU set up the Large-Scale Pilots to deploy
    IoT systems in five main areas [3]. The main goals of these LSPs is to solve key
    practical issues such as interoperability, security and privacy, business models,
    validation of IoT powered applications and services at large-scale, etc. In this
    context, this chapter reports the initial outcomes obtained from security and
    privacy performed in the ACTIVAGE project [1] [4]. These activities contribute
    into mainly two areas: [1] ACTIVAGE project is a key factor in the IoT for the
    “Active and Healthy Ageing” (AHA) domain producing evidence of the IoT value on
    fostering the deployment of AHA solutions in Europe, through the integration of
    advanced IoT technologies across the value chain, demonstrating multiple AHA-IoT
    applications at large-scale in a usage context, in real operational conditions.
    IoT for the AHA domain is a strategic element for the creation of dynamic ecosystems
    to answer and prevent the challenges faced by health and social care systems.
    Differently from other sectors, “AHA-IoT” services are provided to persons taken
    individually and it takes place across all domains, as persons live in houses,
    neighbourhoods, cities, rural areas, mountains and valleys, access to transport
    systems, drive cars, go to shopping centres, airports, theatres, etc. Persons
    are the most extraordinary producers of individual’s data: production and consumption
    of personal data across domains has become the front-line of concern, data privacy,
    security, authentication, access consent, ownership, storage management. In summary,
    ACTIVAGE is an LSP that brings together the IoT and AHA communities to demonstrate
    the value of the first with respect to successful implementation of AHA solutions
    in terms of QoL for Citizens, Sustainability of Health and Social Care Systems
    and Economical and industrial Growth in Europe. Technological – a secure large-scale
    deployment of connected objects. Societal – related to the project context, which
    is to create a smart environment for the ageing well of elderly people allowing
    the collection of sensitive personal data. As in ACTIVAGE, the experimentations
    will involve around 7,000 users across 9 Deployment Sites (DSs) [2], the consortium
    has a great concern when it comes to the security and privacy related challenges
    and an opportunity to resolve these issues with the help of large-scale validation
    and testing. Platforms using public communication infrastructure will interconnect
    many IoT devices, which are inherently weakly secured. Several services will process
    confidential data by requiring control over the propagation of access control
    in the spirit of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) [5]. GDPR is a
    primary law regulating how companies/organizations protect EU citizens’ personal
    data. [2] A Deployment site is a city or a region in the European Union in where
    a full large-scale pilot is set. This chapter gives an overview of the end-to-end
    security and privacy impact analysis performed in order to provide actionable
    recommendations. The outcomes are in the shape of guidelines and framework related
    to the cybersecurity and privacy aspects. The security risk analysis is conducted
    at each layer of an IoT system and its deployment procedure. The objective is
    twofold: to bring an awareness of the security risks to the stakeholders involved
    in each deployment site and the provision of solutions/recommendations – concerning
    the technologies and services to be deployed for security and privacy of the IoT
    infrastructure. The chapter aims at describing the cybersecurity and privacy methodologies
    and solutions that the ACTIVAGE architecture and the corresponding deployment
    sites should follow in order to secure the IoT system and data from potential
    malicious cyber-attacks and threats. It further presents common definitions, methods
    and repeatable processes to analyse and address all potential threats in terms
    of cybersecurity and privacy that might occur during the exploitation phase of
    the project. The whole process takes into account: Typical cybersecurity and privacy
    risks due to the IoT context. DSs particularities in terms of cybersecurity needs
    (e.g. data relevance). Relevance and effectiveness of cybersecurity and privacy
    mechanisms already foreseen by the DSs security managers. In this work, an IoT
    system is divided into four layers (domains): device, gateway, cloud and application.
    The security and privacy analysis is performed throughout the entire system starting
    from the device domain to the application domain. It also considers the overall
    system life cycle, i.e. the analysis process is applied not only for the operation
    phase but also at configuration, installation, maintenance and removal phases.
    The rest of the chapter is organized as follows. Section 4.2 presents the global
    objectives and requirements for cybersecurity and privacy in the context of AHA-IoT
    ecosystem. Section 4.3 presents the main recommendations on Cybersecurity and
    Privacy in IoT. Sections 4.4 and 4.5 present the methodologies undertaken for
    security and privacy and the recommendations in this context. Section 4.6 illustrates,
    through example use cases, some security and privacy solutions harnessed from
    the top-down approaches and their associated recommendations. Finally, Section
    4.7 concludes this chapter. 4.2 Global Objectives and Requirements 4.2.1 Security
    In an information system, the key objectives and requirements are defined to prevent
    unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification, or removal of important data
    or information. CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability) triad is a common
    and globally accepted model that is used to secure important information. The
    main cybersecurity objectives [6, 7] are: Confidentiality: no improper disclosure
    of information. Integrity: no improper modification of information (alteration,
    deletion or creation). Availability: no improper impairment of functionality.
    In order to reach above objectives, the typical cybersecurity properties or requirements
    are listed as follows: Authorization: the rules on who is allowed to read, modify
    or delete which information. User and entity authenticity: the assurance that
    the other party is the intended communication peer, no “man-in-the-middle” scenario.
    Integrity (data and service authenticity): the data is not altered during transmission
    (accidentally or intentionally). Confidentiality: the exchanged data cannot be
    overheard or made available to a third party. Timeliness and validity of the data:
    for example, protection against message replay. Non-repudiation of the transaction:
    the assurance that a transaction is auditable. In addition, system integrity requirements
    include a system protection against physical and logical attacks, a secure software
    update mechanism and the monitoring and reaction capability to system malfunction.
    The mechanisms to achieve these requirements are the following: Access Control:
    selective restriction of access to data or services. Entity authentication: for
    example, a cryptography-based “handshake” scheme. Message cryptographic protection:
    encryption and data authentication. Temporization of data: use of nonces, timestamps,
    counters against replay attacks. Code signing: use of cryptographic hash to validate
    authenticity and integrity of the code. Cryptographic key establishment: a scheme
    to allow key exchange between two parties. OS and hardware security: protection
    mechanisms such as root of trust, secure boot, etc. Additional requirements on
    the cybersecurity solutions are scalability and usability, which focus on the
    identification and access control methodology combined with usability of human
    interfaces. Furthermore, the system management deals with the management of the
    keys, the configuration, installation, replacement of devices, and the monitoring
    and malfunction detection. If security and privacy are already big challenges
    on IT systems, these challenges become much more important on the IoT systems
    considering that the attack surface has significantly been enlarged as well as
    the amount of data generated and handled [8]. Furthermore, the impact becomes
    more important considering that IoT devices have not enough processing capabilities,
    in contrast to IT systems, and they have a limited autonomy because they work
    most of the cases on batteries. They use generally different wireless connectivity
    solutions not compliant with existing security standards. Last but not the least,
    the nature of the applications, for instance AHA, requires a high level of security
    to keep end-to-end data integrity, confidentiality and service availability. The
    AHA users are very concerned by these aspects. Secure IoT systems with high level
    of personal data protection are mandatory to keep the users’ trust. These aspects
    are essential to deploy massively the IoT technologies in the coming years. 4.2.2
    Privacy Concerning the objectives and recommendations for the privacy this work
    uses the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (EU 2016/679) [3] as the basis.
    In addition, the Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) process is used to put
    in place such regulation. The article 1 of GDPR defines the following objectives:
    [3] Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of
    27 April 2016. This Regulation lays down relating to the protection of natural
    persons with regards to the processing of personal data and rules relating to
    the free movement of personal data. This regulation protects fundamental rights
    and freedoms of natural persons and in particular their right to the protection
    of personal data. The free movement of personal data within the Union shall be
    neither restricted nor prohibited for reasons connected with the protection of
    natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data. The GDPR defines
    also the following requirements: The protection of the rights and freedoms of
    natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data requires that appropriate
    legal, technical and organizational measures be taken to ensure that the requirements
    of this Regulation are met. In order to be able to demonstrate compliance with
    this regulation, the data controller should adopt internal policies and implement
    measures that meet in particular the principles of data protection by design and
    data protection by default. Such measures could consist, inter alia, of: Minimizing
    the processing of personal data. Pseudonymising personal data as soon as possible.
    Transparency regarding the functions and processing of personal data. Enabling
    the data subject to monitor the data processing. Enabling the controller to create
    and improve security features. 4.3 Recommendations on Cybersecurity and Privacy
    in IoT 4.3.1 Security Security is a complex and critical concern for any manager
    of interconnected digital assets. Many private companies [9], public bodies [10]
    and standardization/harmonization institutes (e.g. RFC 2196 Site Security Handbook)
    have published recommendations aiming at improving the quality and consistency
    of the security levels across interconnected systems. Such recommendations target
    system managers, organization officers, service providers, infrastructure owners,
    product manufacturers, developers, end users and indirectly also attackers. In
    fact, as promoted by security experts, every security measure, mechanism and algorithm
    must rely on publicly available specifications. Recommendations are elaborated
    and publicized proactively [15, 11] and reactively [11]. Interestingly some of
    them are associated to supporting tools [10]. All these sets of recommendations
    present diverse facets of similar rules and recommendations. It is not possible
    to include the whole list in this chapter. However, recommendations insist on
    the fact that security is a continuous process with integrated improvement procedure,
    based on the continuous evaluation of the in-place security. Therefore, external
    inspection such as auditing is a must. Self-auditing and internal expertise are
    strongly required, but by far not enough. External companies offer services to
    analyse the implemented security, including security standards, such as ISO/IEC
    27001 and 27002, the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. 4.3.2 Privacy When developing,
    designing and using applications, services and products that aim to process personal
    data to fulfil their task, the developers/producers of such products, services
    and applications are recommended to take into account the right to data protection.
    It is important to make sure that controllers and processors are capable enough
    to fulfil data protection obligations. Furthermore, the principles of data protection
    by design and by default should be also taken into consideration in the context
    of public tenders. A report by ENISA (the European Union Agency for Network and
    Information Society) elaborates on what needs to be done to achieve privacy and
    data protection by default [13]. It specifies that encryption and decryption operations
    must be carried out locally, not by a remote service, because both keys and data
    must remain in the power of the data owner if greater privacy needs to be achieved.
    The report specifies that outsourced data storage on remote clouds is practical
    and relatively safe, as long as only the data owner, not the cloud service, holds
    the decryption keys. In literature, there are additional principles and guidelines
    available that can be used to achieve privacy and data protection by default,
    also known as privacy by design. Privacy by design [14] is a concept, developed
    in the 90’s, to address the ever-growing and systemic effects of Information and
    Communication Technologies (ICTs), and of large-scale networked data systems.
    The objectives of privacy by design – ensuring privacy and gaining personal control
    over one’s information, and, for organizations, gaining a sustainable competitive
    advantage – may be accomplished by practicing the following 7 foundational principles:
    Proactive not reactive; preventative not remedial. Privacy as the default setting.
    Privacy embedded into design. Full functionality – positive-sum, not zero-sum.
    End-to-end security – full lifecycle protection. Visibility and transparency –
    keep it open. Respect for user privacy – keep it user-centric. 4.4 Security Approach
    4.4.1 Methodology To achieve the objectives defined above, a number of activities
    are performed to lay down the security and privacy policies in the context of
    ACTIVAGE project. For the purpose of security, activities include: Perform a reference
    risk analysis in the ACTIVAGE IoT environment in order to identify the general
    ACTIVAGE security requirements, which depend on the criticality of applications
    or services. Countermeasures to mitigate risks are identified at this stage. Create
    and elaborate the ACTIVAGE security questionnaire. Analyse questionnaires’ responses
    and perform assessments for the DS’ security requirements. Define the security
    cartography and recommendations for each deployment site. The elaboration of the
    security questionnaire considered the following aspects: Collect relevant information
    allowing the identification of missing mechanisms to ensure full end-to-end cybersecurity
    and privacy for each of the DSs. Make it easy for the DSs security managers to
    reply. The DS security manager is in charge of the security and privacy aspects
    related to this DS. Make the DSs security managers aware of cybersecurity and
    privacy issues that have not yet been identified and support the other stakeholders
    to realize the high importance of these aspects that are critical considering
    the nature of the project, which includes data confidentiality, higher vulnerability
    by connecting “smart objects” to the system, etc. Figure 4.1 ACTIVAGE Reference
    Architecture. Security analysis is performed based on the following assumptions:
    All IoT devices and elements constituting the DS meet safety requirements according
    to the existing norms and regulations in conformance to their original purpose.
    This falls into the responsibility of the device manufacturer or SW provider/service
    provider and of the DS manager. e.g., an electrical heater used to ensure the
    comfort of elderly people must respect basic norms for electrical heaters. DS
    security managers know the basic norms and regulations rules with which the devices,
    SW and services used must comply. The managers should be able to provide the corresponding
    evidence and they should highlight any unconformity. Questionnaires take into
    account that the answers are given considering the country rules where the DS
    is deployed. Each of the service providers who plans to use the ACTIVAGE technology
    needs to upgrade and adapt the DS elements/settings/ components to the norms and
    the regulations in force at the time and in relation to the location of the commercial
    exploitation. The general risk analysis adopted the ACTIVAGE Reference Architecture
    shown in Figure 4.1 and was carried along the following typical steps: Identification
    and description of all the assets to be protected in the IoT system. Identification
    of all threats and vulnerabilities for each asset. Quantification of security
    risk caused by the threats and vulnerabilities, using a metric. Risk management:
    the decision on which risks to counter and which ones are acceptable. The risk
    analysis leads to the definition of the appropriate security measures. 4.4.1.1
    Assets identification and description An Assets list was established as a guideline
    to be carefully analysed, completed (if needed) and used for each DS. It includes
    all data in the system, services, pieces of hardware, software, communication
    links and may be extended to intellectual property, brand reputation, buildings
    etc. The most important items in this list are given hereafter. Data assets include
    application and management data. The typesets and formats should be defined in
    the data model. Application data describe the elements or resources of the IoT
    system. They include, for example: Data describing all entities producing or consuming
    data (Identifiers and attributes of individuals, stakeholders, sensors). Data
    that are monitored and analysed by the IoT system in order to ensure the expected
    service (raw measurements, processed data elements). Decisions of the system that
    influence the subject’s environment (guidance or prescriptions for individuals,
    environmental instructions for smart sensors, configuration instructions for devices).
    Management data relate to system operation. They include, for example: Procedure,
    action plan descriptions (definition of all the planned actions in case of occurrence
    of an extreme event). Data storage organization definition (for example, a Grading
    Table, Detail Description predefines categories for data storage, such as Medical
    information, Medical report, Wellness information, Service, etc.). Access Rights
    Table, defining the access rights for each stakeholder profile. Transaction registers,
    logging the History of all operated transactions (communication channel, data,
    data user, time, etc.). Cryptographic material that may include log-in credentials,
    cryptographic secrets for authentication and encryption, root-of-trust information
    (e.g. trusted PKI public key), public key certificates, etc. Assets also include
    hardware and software elements. Communication channels. The connection between
    the devices and the IoT-Gateway is generally wireless (BLE, Z-wave; Zigbee, etc.).
    The connection between the IoT-Gateway and the Cloud can be an Internet connection.
    However, and many times, the IoT-Gateway is connected via Wi-Fi/Ethernet to a
    second Gateway that performs the Internet connection via 2G/3G/4G or a wired connection
    (XDSL, Cable, OF). On the application end, the connection between the user and
    the Cloud can be wired or wireless. The wired connection can be through the chain
    Lap and Desk Tops, LAN, Gateway. The Gateway allows connecting the user with the
    Internet network and this one to the Cloud. The wireless connection (2G/3G/4G)
    is done by having a direct connection between the Smart Phones and Tables directly
    to Internet having access to Web applications. Component hardware. For example,
    typical hardware assets to consider at the low domains (Device and Gateway) are
    data storage units, processing units, power management blocks, sensing and actuating
    blocks as well as all device interfaces (e.g. I/O, JTAG ports, etc.) and device
    casing. Maturity and configuration must be assessed. Component software and configuration
    information. Software must be analysed at all levels: OS, firmware, application
    embedded software, high-level application container. Boot mechanisms and system
    configuration at all IoT levels also need particular protection and are included
    in the assets list. Trust associations (end-to-end security). Establishing an
    end-to-end security association, between the data source and their final destination,
    provides a higher and often necessary level of data protection. The data are not
    made available at any of the intermediate hops, since they are encrypted at their
    source and only the final data user is able to decrypt them. 4.4.1.2 Security
    risk analysis tools: Product or service compliance class, STRIDE, DREAD The IoT
    Security Compliance Framework [15] and other guideline documents issued by the
    IoT Security Foundation are used to enhance best security practices during development
    and installation of an IoT product (or system or service). The Framework includes
    the definition of Compliance Classes for products and a series of criteria in
    order to validate their security depending on the targeted class. Applicability
    of the requirements on a product depends on its compliance class, which is expressed
    as a number between 0 to 4, increasing with security level. To define compliance
    classes, three levels of risk impact, BASIC, MEDIUM and HIGH, are defined for
    each of the three security objectives, namely confidentiality, integrity and availability.
    For instance, MEDIUM confidentiality corresponds to “Devices process sensitive
    information (including Personally Identifiable Information – PII); limited impact
    if compromised” and is required from class 2. The risk analysis methodology followed
    in ACTIVAGE to identify the threats is based on the STRIDE Methodology, see Table
    4.1. This Threat classification model was developed by Microsoft [18, 19], and
    helps answering the question “what can go wrong in the system?” The risk mitigation
    technologies (Cybersecurity measures or Cybersecurity controls) against a STRIDE
    threat to apply on the system element under consideration depend on the element
    type, perspective (developer, administrator) and assessed risk level (DREAD rate).
    Recommendations by foundations or standard bodies give guidelines in this task,
    providing lists of Cybersecurity requirements depending on risk level (or compliance
    class) as well as best-practice tips [16, 17]. Table 4.1 STRIDE Threat Concerned
    Security Property Spoofing Authentication Tampering Integrity Repudiation Non-repudiation
    Information disclosure Confidentiality Denial of service Availability Elevation
    of privilege Authorization In the case study described here below, we identify
    the Cybersecurity controls to apply to each system element and gives an indication
    of: The compliance classes for which the control must be applied. The applicability
    level, which is defined as mandatory (the requirement shall be met, as it is vital
    to secure the product category) or as advisory (the requirement should be met
    unless there are sound reasons such as economic viability or hardware complexity,
    in which case the reasons for deviating from the requirement must be documented).
    Figure 4.2 IoT device assets and STRIDE representation. 4.4.1.3 ACTIVAGE as example
    of Risk Analysis The Threat analysis is performed on Device, Gateway, Cloud and
    Application domains following the proposed IoT reference architecture. As an example,
    the STRIDE analysis applied to an IoT reference Device is detailed below. Proposed

    and Services). Data grading table in (DS1) & Access right table in (DS1). In Device
    Data Flow (DF), the following analysis must be performed on: Connectivity/Communication
    channels: BLE, Wi-Fi, LoRa, NB-IoT Nature of Data: Individual Subject, Devices,
    Raw & Processed Data, Instructions (Users, Environmental, Devices & Services).
    In this example, the threats concerning the related asset are identified in red
    bold characters in Figure 4.2: In DS1: Tampering, Repudiation, Information disclosure
    and Denial of service. In P1: Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information disclosure,
    Denial of service and Elevation of Privilege. In CC1: Tampering, Information disclosure
    and Denial of service. Subsequently, an evaluation of the vulnerability of the
    IoT Device is performed. The question to be answered is: “What will be the impact
    of the attacks on the assets?” All the threats for every element are rated using
    DREAD method ranked from 1 to 3 point, where the DREAD rate refers to all the
    risks as defined in Table 4.2. Table 4.2 DREAD ranking definition Risk Risk Property

    come across it 3pts (high): The vulnerability is located in the most commonly
    feature and is very noticeable See below a DREAD ranking based of on the proposed

    in Europe has gained a lot of visibility through the advent of the new General
    Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) entered in force on May 25th, 2018 in the European
    Union. Until recently, companies making business out of personal or other types
    of data systematically pushed privacy back. Entities promoting the privacy preservation
    and enforcement processes propose different approaches. In this chapter, the authors
    propose to develop a general methodology on Privacy to define a privacy impact
    analysis for a given IoT System and provide recommendations and guidelines in
    order to minimize the Privacy threats. The complete methodology is described hereafter.
    It is under deployment in the Deployment sites of the ACTIVAGE project. Moreover,
    and in complement of the Security methodology described in Section 4.4, the authors
    made an analysis of the GDPR to identify the Privacy modules/services/articles
    that should be implemented in any IoT system of the ACTIVAGE project. This analysis
    allowed identifying some use cases that are well suited to be implemented using
    a Blockchain based technology, as described in the Section 4.6.3. 4.5.2 Methodology
    to Perform Privacy Analysis and Recommendations Figure 4.3 shows the Privacy methodology
    proposed in order to perform risk privacy analysis on an IoT system. This is the
    methodology we have used in ACTIVAGE for this purpose. The expected outcomes are
    the identification of the countermeasures/recommendations for this IoT system
    to minimize the risks of privacy threats: data theft, data misuse or any other
    malicious usage. This methodology is addressed to any non-professional data protection
    manager to facilitate, him/her, the implementation of the GDPR regulation. Figure
    4.3 Privacy methodology. This methodology consists in the execution of the following
    four main steps: Background – A good acknowledge of the following elements is
    required: What is the GDPR? What is a DPIA and how should be performed? What are
    the IoT System architecture and topology where the Data will be generated, stored,
    processed and exploited (and by whom) to identify security rights? In order to
    get the answers to these questions, the following documents are available [5,
    20–24]. Identify personal data flow and storage – For any IoT system, it is required
    to know its complete and detailed architecture and topology as discussed in Section
    4.4. This information allows “easily” the identification of assets, data flows,
    data storage, process units, users, etc. and their location. Perform Data Impact
    Performance Assessment – (DPIA) This step is key in the methodology. The importance
    of this step and the way to develop it are described with more details in the
    next paragraph. Provide Privacy Impact Analysis and Recommendations – This step
    provides the DPIA analysis results of the IoT system under study and the recommendations
    proposed to deploy the system with good Privacy properties. 4.5.3 Data Protection
    Impact Assessment (DPIA)4 [4] [4] This information contained in this paragraph
    was extracted from [20]. GDPR introduces the concept of a Data Protection Impact
    Assessment (DPIA) [5] [20] and strongly recommend carrying out one for each system
    concerned. This paragraph addresses the following questions: what is a DPIA?,
    when a DPIA is mandatory and how to carry it?, and what are the main elements
    containing a DPIA? [5] The term “Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) is often used
    in other contexts to refer to the same concept”, for more information see [21–23].
    4.5.3.1 What is a DPIA? “A DPIA is a process designed to describe the processing,
    assess the necessity and proportionality of a processing and to help managing
    the risks to the rights and freedoms of natural persons resulting from the processing
    of personal data. DPIAs are important tools for accountability, as they help controllers
    not only to comply with requirements of the GDPR, but also to demonstrate that
    appropriate measures have been taken to ensure compliance with the Regulation.
    In other words, a DPIA is a process for building and demonstrating compliance”.
    Under the GDPR, non-compliance with DPIA requirements can lead to fines imposed
    by the competent supervisory authority. Failure to carry out a DPIA [6] can each
    result in an administrative fine of up to 10M€, or in the case of an undertaking,
    up to 2% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year,
    whichever is higher. [6] For instance, when the processing is subject to a DPIA,
    or carrying out a DPIA in an incorrect way, or failing to consult the competent
    supervisory authority where required. 4.5.3.2 When is a DPIA mandatory? Where
    a processing is “likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of
    natural persons”. Table 4.5 gives some examples where a DPIA is required. Table
    4.5 Examples where DPIA is required Examples of Processing Possible Relevant Criteria
    DPIA Required? A hospital processing its patients’ genetic and health data (hospital
    information system). Sensitive data Data concerning vulnerable data subjects Yes
    The use of a camera system to monitor driving behavior on highways. The controller
    envisages using an intelligent video analysis system to single out cars and automatically
    recognize license plates. Systematic monitoring Innovative use or applying technological
    or organizational solutions Yes A company monitoring its employees’ activities,
    including the monitoring of the employees’ work station, internet activity, etc.
    Systematic monitoring Data concerning vulnerable data subjects Yes An online magazine
    using a mailing list to send a generic daily digest to its subscribers. — Not
    necessarily 4.5.3.3 When should the DPIA be carried out? “prior to the processing”.
    This is consistent with data protection by design and by default principles. The
    DPIA should be started as early as practical in the design of the processing operation
    even if some of the processing operations are still unknown. As the DPIA is updated
    throughout the lifecycle project. It will ensure that data protection and privacy
    are considered and promote the creation of solutions that promote compliance.
    4.5.3.4 What is the DPIA minimum content? The GDPR does not formally define the
    concept of a DPIA as such, but it sets out its minimum features as follows: Its
    minimal content is specified as follows: A systematic description of the envisaged
    processing operations and the purposes of the processing, including, where applicable,
    the legitimate interest pursued by the controller. An assessment of the necessity
    and proportionality of the processing operations in relation to the purposes.
    An assessment of the risks to the rights and freedoms of data subjects. The measures
    envisaged to address the risks, including safeguards, security measures and mechanisms
    to ensure the protection of personal data and to demonstrate compliance with this
    Regulation taking into account the rights and legitimate interests of data subjects
    and other persons concerned. Its meaning and role are clarified: “In order to
    enhance compliance with this Regulation where processing operations are likely
    to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller
    should be responsible for the carrying-out of a data protection impact assessment
    to evaluate, in particular, the origin, nature, particularity and severity of
    that risk”. Figure 4.4 illustrates the generic iterative process for carrying
    out a DPIA. It should be underlined that the process depicted here is iterative:
    in practice, it is likely that each of the stages is revisited multiple times
    before the DPIA can be completed. Furthermore, this process should be regularly
    performed to evaluate the IoT system evolution over the time. Figure 4.4 Process
    for carrying out a DPIA. Practical recommendations (necessary but not sufficient)
    when carrying out a DPIA The basic recommendation is to collect only required
    personal data to minimize the risk of non-compliance. It excludes the “just in
    case” approach in which unjustified data is collected for future uses, even when
    they may be justified. It requires a complete audit of the data already in possession
    of the various stakeholders (processors, etc.), and the data must be kept based
    on the principle of usefulness for the subject and necessity for the service.
    4.5.4 GDPR Analysis for Implementation To cope with GDPR in an IT system and more
    particularly on IoT based system (as such foreseen in ACTIVAGE where security
    and privacy are of high importance according to AHA applications supported), a
    first analysis was performed on the set of articles constituting the GDPR. They
    were analysed and classified as follows: Legal: Articles related with legal issues.
    Technical: Articles requiring a technical implementation. Accountability: Articles
    related to the organization/company Governance. Principles: Articles providing
    recommendations to be considering in the GDPR implementation. Table 4.6 gives
    the details of this analysis. It is composed of three columns indicating (from
    the left to the right): the type of article (Legal, Technical, etc.), the type
    of service and the article description concerned by the GDPR. Table 4.6 GDPR Analysis
    in view of its implementation Type of Article Provided Function or Service GDPR

    regularly data protection risk profiles. Accountability Governance Article 37
    – Designation of the data protection officer. Article 38 – Position of the data
    protection officer. Article 39 – Tasks of the data protection officer. On top
    of this first analysis, Varonis [7] recommends focusing on the following technical
    aspects during the implementation phase to meet the GDPR [25]: [7] Varonis is
    a pioneer in data security and analytics, specializing in software for data security,
    governance, compliance, classification, and analytics. Data classification – Know
    where personal data is stored on the IT/IoT system. This is critical for both
    protecting the data as well as following through on requests to correct and erase
    personal data. Metadata – With GDPR requirements for limiting data retention,
    basic information on when and why the data was collected are required, as well
    as its purpose. Personal data residing in IT/IoT systems should be periodically
    reviewed to see whether it needs to be saved for the future. Governance – GDPR
    highlights the need to get back to basics. For enterprise (or AHA data), this
    should include understanding who is accessing personal data in the AHA file system,
    who should be authorized to access, and limiting file permission based on users’
    actual roles – i.e., role-based access controls. Monitoring – The breach notification
    requirement places a new burden on data controllers. Under the GDPR, the IT/IoT
    security mantra should be “always be monitoring”. Data protection controllers
    need to spot unusual access patterns against files containing personal data, and
    promptly report an exposure to the local data authority. Failure to do so can
    lead to enormous fines, particularly for multinationals with large global revenues.
    The analysis performed in this section contributed to identify several Privacy
    uses cases to be implemented using the innovative and pervasive Blockchain as
    a potential technology to provide robust and efficient IoT solutions on security
    and privacy. The following section describes these developments. 4.6 Security
    and Privacy Implementation 4.6.1 Introduction This section presents two use cases
    selected to illustrate the interest and the importance to follow a top-down approach
    for security and privacy. During the end-to-end security risk analysis and DPIA
    performed on the IoT systems of the ACTIVAGE project, this approach allowed the
    identification of the recommendations and solutions to put in place to improve
    the security of some IoT system components as well as the services/functions to
    cope with GDPR privacy requirements. It is clear that the Privacy services must
    run on top of a Secure IoT system. The first use case presents the countermeasures
    implemented to secure the data storage of the Raspberry PI Gateway used in some
    Deployment sites of ACTIVAGE. The second use case presents several scenarios where
    the Blockchain technology can be used to provide efficient solutions on security
    and privacy for the ACTIVAGE’s Deployment sites. 4.6.2 Securing a Gateway The
    Gateway in an IoT device to Cloud architecture is a key element as it marks the
    frontier between the public and private domains. In this position in the architecture,
    the Gateway is indeed both an entry path from inside to outside and reverse. In
    a worst-case scenario, somebody gaining access to a Gateway gains access to other
    Gateways, by reproducing the attack at a massive scale. In the ACTIVAGE context,
    Gateways are often deployed in homes, and thus it is not possible to master the
    physical access to the hardware. Moreover, the Gateway, in a residential place,
    might be stolen more easily than a server in a data centre might be. The Raspberry
    PI is a popular platform for its low cost, stability and good support. In experimental
    projects such as ACTIVAGE, it is the platform of choice to be used as a Gateway.
    The analysis done from ACTIVAGE questionnaires on IoT devices used in the 9 Deployment
    sites has shown that at least 4 out 9 deployment sites are considering using such
    hardware platforms as reference for their experiments. However, the Risk analysis
    performed on the Raspberry PI has identified potential weaknesses regarding security.
    A major weakness concerns the SD Card mass storage. Due to its removable nature,
    this mass storage can be easily accessed from a third-party system by simply removing
    the SD Card and plugging it to a computer. In this way, the content would be cleared
    and read/write operation unauthenticable making it easy for a hacker to read out
    and even replace sensitive information such as user’s password, SSH private keys
    or other credentials that could enable privileged access to the entire system.
    Table 4.7 illustrates the impact assessment of the different stride attributes
    for the mass storage of the gateway in the ACTIVAGE context (deployment in residential
    homes). The initial DREAD rates on the third column shows potential impacts. The
    last column shows new rates while mitigating the risks with a secure element.
    A first counter-measure for this weakness would be to encrypt the entire SD Card,
    thus, it requires storing the encryption key in a safe place, which is readable
    by the processor and the firmware while booting the OS located on the storage.
    A common solution for such a safe storage is to use a Trusted Platform Module
    (TPM). TPMs are standardized electronic components which have security related
    functions such as random number, hash and key generators, encryption and decryption
    hardware engines and offers facilities to store in secure manner keys or sensitive
    data such as Platform Configuration Registers. These components are used for example
    for secured boot in UEFI bios. Table 4.7 shows on the two last right columns the
    new DREAD rate while using such a component, with highest risks reduce to a safer
    impact level. Table 4.7 DREAD impact assessment Threat Class STRIDE Security Property

    1.2 Figure 4.5 Raspberry PI model 3 with TPM dedicated hat in white. Figure 4.5
    shows a prototype hat for a Raspberry PI embedding a TPM manufactured and assembled
    in this form by STMicroelectronics. Customization of the Linux Kernel for enabling
    TPM support was also made with the appropriate device tree modification. The TPM
    is provisioned with security credentials bound to the ACTIVAGE Public key Infrastructure
    (PKI), ensuring security credential lifecycle up to the revocation of gateways
    that are suspected to be compromised. This PKI delivers certificates that can
    be used for the OS and application layer, with state-of-art cryptography scheme.
    At the application level, ongoing work is focused on using the TPM secure function
    whenever possible. A first step consists in the partial encryption of the SD Card.
    Indeed, while the kernel is located on a clear partition for booting up, the application
    section is located into a LUKS partition which key is located onto the TPM. It
    prevents somebody reading the SD card from another platform. Future work will
    be to encrypt the entire SD card with the decryption within the boot loader. Other
    work consists in emulating a PKCS11 interface from the TPM. PKCS11 is a standardized
    public key cryptography standard specifically related to tokens. The use of this
    standard enables trustful communication for the establishment of TLS or SSL tunnels,
    which can be used for the traffic between the Gateway and the Cloud. Use of such
    tunnels enables encrypted and authenticated communications and prevents the Gateway
    from being detectable on public network as no IP ports need to be opened for incoming
    connections. Other use of this interface is under investigation for future work
    regarding IoT device provisioning. 4.6.3 Blockchain in Smart Homes Recently, the
    Blockchain technology has been applied for the healthcare industry [26] but also
    in IoT-based Smart Homes [27], reducing the time required to access patient information,
    enhancing interoperability and improving data quality, while reducing maintenance
    costs. A Blockchain is a continuously growing list of immutable records, called
    blocks, which are linked and secured using cryptography. Thus, the adoption of
    Blockchain is a very promising technology towards enhancing the security, privacy
    and trust. As described in the previous sections, ACTIVAGE gives special focus
    on GDPR compliance. Blockchain can act as a very useful tool towards achieving
    GDPR compliance [28], mainly by serving as a trusted decentralized repository
    for identification purposes. However, it has to be ensured that: a) no personal
    data are stored on the Blockchain, b) cryptographic data deletion should be used
    to give to the end-user the “right to be forgotten”. Blockchain can also enhance
    security as it can enable IoT devices to connect securely and reliably avoiding
    the threats of device spoofing and impersonation. Every IoT device can be registered
    in the Blockchain and will have an ID that will uniquely identify this device
    in the universal namespace. In the context of ACTIVAGE project, a trusted management
    solution, based on Blockchain technologies, has been proposed considering the
    results of other H2020 project implementations such as GHOST/H2020, myAirCoach/H2020.
    ACTIVAGE will find in this technology a convenient solution to cope with: Privacy
    regulation based on GDPR. The integrated healthcare and AHA implications for data
    and devices protection. An adequate trusted mechanism for IoT-based devices, users
    and systems within the smart Home environment. The concept of distributed ledger
    technologies can be introduced within ACTIVAGE to support different use case scenarios
    such as: Requesting/giving/updating permissions for accessing personal data of
    the involved user. Device registration. Timely firmware updates. User authentication
    & authorization. The secure data transfer between endpoints, users and healthcare
    network components. Figure 4.6 ACTIVAGE monitoring platform – BaaS platform architectural
    overview. Towards the formulation of a secure and trusted environment using information
    traceability mechanisms and the spreading of the data in AHA information systems,
    a related ACTIVAGE Blockchain framework has been introduced (see Figure 4.6) consisting
    of the following main components: BaaS Web UI (The Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS)
    Web UI) – It is a web front-end for accessing the functionalities provided by
    the Blockchain network that has been implemented within myAirCoach H2020 project.
    Middleware API – The Middleware API enables the communication between the ACTIVAGE
    Monitoring Platform and the Blockchain network. For this purpose, RESTful web
    services are used over the HTTPS protocol. Blockchain network – This is the network
    of Blockchain nodes where information regarding the various transactions are being
    stored. ACTIVAGE decentralised Monitoring Platform – This is a decentralised platform
    where raw data gathered from the sensors installed in the smart homes of the elderly
    users are stored and further analysed towards identifying patterns related to
    user activity (e.g. habits, sleeping times, etc.) and further identifying abnormal
    events that may be related to emergencies. Through the ACTIVAGE Monitoring Platform
    and all the other Blockchain components, a trusted environment is offered to the
    formal/informal carers/end-users as well as to the elderly users/patients. In
    the following paragraphs, several use case scenarios for using Blockchain technology
    within ACTIVAGE are described. 4.6.3.1 Register in BaaS/give consent In this scenario,
    the user accesses the registration form in the BaaS Web UI by clicking on the
    relevant link. After filling the registration form with their data and accepting
    the Terms of Service, a verification email is sent to their email address. By
    clicking on the hyperlink, included in the corresponding email, the user is redirected
    to the BaaS Web UI and their email is verified. After the email verification process,
    the user can Login the BaaS Web UI. The transaction related to user registration
    is logged in the Blockchain. 4.6.3.2 Register in the ACTIVAGE monitoring platform
    through BaaS A user is able to register to the ACTIVAGE Monitoring Platform from
    the BaaS Web UI. Thus, the user first logs in to BaaS with his/her account, goes
    to “Platforms > Not Registered Platforms”, chooses ACTIVAGE from the list and
    clicks on the “Register” button. Then, user is redirected to the ACTIVAGE Monitoring
    Platform and fills in the Registration Form. Similarly, to the previous scenario,
    an email verification process is followed for the completion of user registration
    in the ACTIVAGE Monitoring Platform. The next time that the user logs in the BaaS
    Web UI, ACTIVAGE is among his/her “Registered Platforms”. Again, the transaction
    related to user registration is logged in the Blockchain. 4.6.3.3 Register in
    the ACTIVAGE monitoring platform with BaaS In this scenario, user fills in the
    Registration Form in the ACTIVAGE Monitoring Platform (option: Register via BaaS).
    The ACTIVAGE Monitoring Platform sends the valid credentials of the user to the
    Middleware API through a RESTful Web Service. Then, the Middleware API sends the
    registration request to the user via email and redirects them to the BaaS Web
    UI Registration Form. The user registers using the BaaS Registration Form and
    this transaction of the newly Registered User is logged in the Blockchain network.
    4.6.3.4 Registration of new devices and software updates In ACTIVAGE, Blockchain
    can be applied not only for the secured registration and authorization of users,
    but also for the envisaged IoT-based devices that are being installed in the smart
    Home environment supporting also the timely update of firmware, patches, etc.,
    in order to be performed only by authorized users. 4.6.3.5 Login/Logout When the
    user logs in/out to/from the ACTIVAGE Monitoring Platform, a corresponding request
    for user login/logout is automatically sent to the middleware API over a RESTful
    Web Service. The Middleware API updates the list with online Users that are kept
    within the Blockchain by adding/removing the User to/from the list. Thus, all
    login/logout processes are logged in the Blockchain network. Figure 4.7 Request
    permissions for accessing personal data. 4.6.3.6 Request/Give/Update permissions
    for accessing personal data In this scenario, depicted in Figure 4.7, a caregiver
    asks for permission to access the personal data of an elderly person through the
    ACTIVAGE monitoring platform. This request is sent to the Middleware API, which
    logs it in the Blockchain by also sending a request for permission approval to
    the elderly via email. By using the hyperlinks included in the email, the elderly
    is directed to the BaaS Web UI where he/she can accept or reject the request and
    the corresponding approval/rejection is also logged in the Blockchain network.
    Through the Middleware API, the result is sent back to the ACTIVAGE Monitoring
    Platform and based on the decision of the elderly the caregiver is able or unable
    to access the personal data of the elderly. These scenarios give a good overview
    of the possibilities offered using Blockchain technology in AHA applications and
    more particularly its implementation and validation through the ACTIVAGE project
    in order to ensure security and privacy in its deployment sites. 4.7 Conclusions
    In this chapter, two complementary methodologies were presented one for security
    and the other for privacy in order to address the challenges presented in the
    previous paragraphs. They were developed to help the IoT System developers of
    ACTIVAGE to secure their systems and implement correctly personal data protection
    to cope with the GDPR requirements. These methodologies follow a twofold approach
    a top down and an end-to-end. These approaches concern from one side the security
    risk analysis to identify in advance potential threats and find the countermeasures
    to mitigate/avoid them. From the other side, a privacy approach to put in place
    the GDPR following a DPIA analysis to identify the system characteristics and
    evaluate the risks related to the personal data and its protection. This work,
    developed in the frame of the ACTIVAGE project, can be also reused for any other
    IoT system considering the high constrains on security and privacy required by
    AHA applications. Finally, the solutions presented give a good overview of the
    possibilities offered by the use of the Secure element component to secure IoT
    devices (Gateways and Sensor nodes) and the Blockchain technology in AHA applications.
    Both technologies will take an important place in the implementation and validation
    of the security and privacy requirements of the ACTIVAGE’s Deployment sites to
    provide secure IoT systems with a high level of personal data protection and thus
    to increase the users’ trust. Future work will put in place and validate these
    methodologies and the potentials solutions to secure the 9 Deployment sites of
    ACTIVAGE project as well as the protection of the personal data of each of the
    seven thousands of patients “elderly people” participating in the project. Acknowledgement

    Interoperability in IoT is currently a very complex and difficult challenge in
    IoT. Lack of interoperability drastically constrains potential benefits from the
    interconnection of smart objects and hampers the incipient evolution of IoT (Ambient
    Intelligent Environments, natural transparent human-oriented interfaces, integration
    with machine learning mechanisms, blockchain security and Artificial intelligence).
    INTER-IoT solution for interoperability enables platform-to-platform interoperability,
    across any IoT layer and any application domains. In this chapter, INTER-IoT solution
    for platforms’ integration is applied to relevant use cases in the domains of
    e-Health, AHA, AAL, Transport and Logistics. Furthermore, innovative aspects and
    elements of the INTER-IoT are explained, and the benefits of its implementation.
    5.1 Introduction This chapter is about the enablement of IoT interoperability
    though a novel framework provided by the INTER-IoT project [1, 2]. In particular,
    it is focused on the uses cases and applications of the INTER-IoT framework, and
    on the innovative aspects of its implementation. Interoperability is one of the
    major challenges in IoT and has a vital importance in the exploitation of all
    the potential benefits that can be achieved through this new technology paradigm.
    Without interoperability, possibilities and benefits from the use of IoT are significantly
    constrained [3]. INTER-IoT project provides an open cross-layer framework with
    its own associated methodology and integration tools to enable interoperability
    among heterogeneous Internet of Things (IoT) platforms [2]. INTER-IoT will enable
    the quick and effective development of smart IoT applications and services, on
    top of heterogeneous IoT platforms interconnected, and independently from the
    domain (thus between one or several application domains). This chapter explains
    relevant uses cases of the INTER-IoT framework, focused on different application
    domains (Transportation & Logistics, e-Health, Active & Healthy Ageing, and others).
    In addition, it provides a state-of-the-art of the current situation of interoperability
    in IoT, and an overview of new approaches employed in the INTER-IoT implementation.
    5.2 Current Interoperability State of the Art Regarding the implementation of
    IoT, insufficient interoperability among platforms tends to provoke major issues
    both at the technical and business levels [3, 4]. Typical problems are the impossibility
    of integrating non-interoperable IoT devices into non-homogeneous IoT platforms
    as well as the inability of developing applications and services over several
    platforms and different domains. Other important setbacks are the paucity of IoT
    technology penetration, avoidance of customers and companies in employing IoT
    technology, cost increases in general, impossibility of reusing of technical solutions
    and low user satisfaction. Furthermore, lack of interoperability slows and even
    impedes the incipient evolution of IoT. Ambient Intelligent Environments require
    seamless interoperability among elements and interfaces. Also, interoperability
    is essential for the creation of natural transparent human-oriented interfaces
    of Smart Systems, and it has vital importance for the IoT integration with Artificial
    Intelligence and the inclusion of new mechanisms such as blockchain security.
    In recent years, many solutions have been implemented at different levels, from
    the device layer to complete IoT platforms, due to a great interest of both business
    and research institutions in investigating and developing IoT technology. However,
    there is no reference standard for IoT and the development of one is not expected
    in the foreseeable future [3]. Hence, IoT deployments present high heterogeneity
    at all layers (device, networking, middleware, application service, data/semantics),
    which restricts interoperability among their elements and among them. Though many
    projects have dealt with the development of IoT architectures in diversified application
    domains, not many projects have addressed interoperability and integration issues
    among platforms (a clear exception are Butler and iCore [29]). Furthermore, no
    proposals up to the date of the INTER-IoT project approval have been put forward
    to deliver a general, fully reusable and systematic approach to solve multiple
    interoperability problems existing in the IoT platforms technology. The main goal
    of the INTER-IoT project is to offer a solution for the lack of interoperability
    in the Internet of Things by providing an open framework that facilitates “voluntary
    interoperability” among heterogeneous IoT platforms, at any level an IoT deployment
    (device, network, middleware, application or data & semantics), and across any
    IoT application domain [2, 6]. Therefore, INTER-IoT guarantees a transparent and
    effective integration of heterogeneous IoT technology [2, 5]. By using the proposed
    approach, IoT platform heterogeneity can be turned from a crucial problem to a
    great advantage, as there will be no need to wait for a unique standard for an
    interoperable IoT. Instead, interoperable IoT, even on a very large scale, can
    be created through a bottom-up approach. The majority of current existing sensor
    networks and IoT deployments work as standalone entities, and represent isolated
    islands of information, unable to communicate, interoperate and share information
    with other IoT systems and platforms due to the use of different standards and
    to their high inner heterogeneity. In the infrequent cases in which there is an
    integration effort of IoT elements, it is generally performed at the device or
    data layer, seeking only the collection of data from smart devices. However, there
    are many other levels of an IoT deployment, in which it is very beneficial to
    have interoperability, and many other relevant objectives. Differently from current
    interoperability approaches, INTER-IoT uses a layer-oriented approach to exploit
    in depth functionalities of each different layer (device, networking, middleware,
    application services, data & semantics) [1]. Among the different types and levels
    of interoperability, a main challenge is inter-platform interoperability, which
    is addressed on the INTER-IoT project. 5.3 Inter-IoT New Approaches for Implementation
    5.3.1 Multilayer Approach Differently from current interoperability solutions,
    that typically follow a global approach, INTER-IoT uses a layer-oriented approach
    for performing a complete exploitation of each different layer functions [2].
    Despite of the research and development challenge that the design of a layer-oriented
    approach represents, in comparison to a global approach, it can potentially provide
    a very tight and superior bidirectional integration between different IoT platforms.
    Therefore, a multilayer-oriented approach can potentially offer improved performance,
    adaptability, flexibility, modularity, reliability, privacy, trust and security.
    This layer-oriented approach is composed by several interoperability solutions,
    addressed specifically to each level or layer of an IoT deployment: Device-to-Device
    (D2D), Networking-to-Networking (N2N), Middleware-to-Middleware (MW2MW), Application
    & Services-to-Application & Services (AS2AS), Data & Semantics-to-Data & Semantics
    (DS2DS). Each interoperability infrastructure layer has a strong coupling with
    adjacent layers and provides an interface. Interfaces are controlled by a meta-level
    framework to provide unrestricted interoperability. Every interoperability mechanism
    can be accessed through an API. The interoperability infrastructure layers can
    communicate and interoperate through the interfaces. This cross-layering allows
    to achieve a deeper and more complete integration. Next, the different layers
    and associated tools are detailed: Device layer (D2D): Currently applications
    and platforms are tightly coupled, preventing their interaction with other applications
    and platforms, sensors and actuators communicate only within one system, certain
    platforms do not implement some important services (i.e. discovery), or do so
    in an incompatible way. Roaming elements can be missing or inaccessible. IoT Device
    software is never platform independent as companies create proprietary software.
    These facts present enormous difficulties for the achievement of interoperability.
    At the device level, D2D solution will allow the transparent inclusion of new
    IoT devices and the device-to-device interoperation with other smart objects (legacy).
    D2D interoperability will allow boosting the growth of IoT ecosystems. As a potential
    solution, INTER-IoT proposes a D2D gateway that allows any type of data forwarding,
    making the device layer flexible by decoupling the gateway into two independent
    parts: a physical part that only handles network access and communication protocols,
    and a virtual part that handles all other gateway operations and services. When
    connection is lost, the virtual part remains functional and will answer the API
    and Middleware requests. The gateway will follow a modular approach to allow the
    addition of optional service blocks, to adapt to the specific case. Network layer
    (N2N): Currently the immense amount of traffic flows generated by smart devices
    is extremely hard to handle. The scalability of the IoT systems is difficult.
    Also creating the interconnections between gateways and platforms is a complex
    task. N2N solution aims to provide transparent roaming (support for smart devices
    mobility) and their associated mobility information. It will also allow oﬄoading
    and roaming, what implies the interconnection of gateways and platforms through
    the network. INTER-IoT solution at network level uses paradigms such as SDN and
    NFV, and achieves interoperability through the creation of a virtual network,
    with the support of the N2N API. The N2N solution will allow the design and implementation
    of fully interconnected ecosystems. Middleware layer (MW2MW): At the middleware
    level, INTER-IoT solution will enable seamless resource discovery and management
    of IoT smart objects in heterogeneous IoT platforms. Interoperability at the middleware
    layer is achieved through the establishment of an abstraction layer and the attachment
    of IoT platforms to it. Different modules included at this level will provide
    services to manage the virtual representation of the objects, creating the abstraction
    layer to access all their features and information. Among the offered services,
    there are component-based interoperability solutions within the middleware based
    on communication using mediators, bridges and brokers. Brokers are accessible
    through a general API. Interoperability at this layer will allow a global exploitation
    of smart objects in large-scale multi-platform IoT systems [7]. Application &
    Services layer (AS2AS): INTER-IoT allows the use of various services among different
    IoT platforms. Our approach enables discovery, catalogue and composition of services
    from different platforms. AS2AS will also provide an API as an integration toolbox
    to facilitate the development of new applications that integrate existing heterogeneous
    IoT services. Semantics & Data layer (DS2DS): INTER-IoT solution for the DS2DS
    layer will allow a common meaning of data and information among different IoT
    systems and heterogeneous data sources, thus providing semantic interoperability.
    It is based on semantic translation of IoT platforms’ ontologies to/from a common
    IPSM modular ontology. The Inter Platform Semantic Mediator (IPSM) component will
    be responsible for performing ontology-to-ontology translations of the information
    using ontology alignments. It will be necessary to define explicit OWL-demarcated
    semantics for each IoT artifact that would like to interoperate, communicate and
    collaborate [8, 9]. Cross-Layer guarantees non-functional aspects that are required
    across all layers, such as privacy, security, quality of service (QoS) and trust.
    Figure 5.1 INTER-IoT multi-layered architecture. 5.3.2 Virtualization of each
    INTER-IoT Layer Interoperability Solution In order of providing the option of
    a quick set-up of each of the layers of the INTER-IoT framework, it is given the
    option of running a virtualized instance of each of them for rapidly implementing
    the INTER-IoT interoperability solution. This virtualization is performed by means
    of Docker [30] engine. Through the creation of Docker containers, the software
    layer components are separated from each other and from the underlying hardware
    and operating system. Despite of the virtualization, APIs to access to specific
    layers functionalities are secured, and protected through the use of security
    tokens and certificates, and by the assignment of specific permissions to each
    user or type of user. Each layer solution can be deployed and implemented standalone,
    as far as they are independent from other layers’ solutions. Thus, there is no
    need for a complete implementation to achieve interoperability on a specific layer.
    Though, the combined use of adjacent layers’ solutions multiplies benefits, as
    enables some functionalities among them related to multiple layers. 5.3.3 Universal
    Semantic Translation INTER-IoT offers a novel solution to provide automatic semantic
    translation among any pair of platforms [2]. DS2DS solution performs an ontology-to-ontology
    translation between two platforms, and thus it is able to provide universal semantic
    interoperability. The INTER-IoT approach for achieving semantic interoperability
    among heterogeneous IoT platforms is based on: The definition of explicit, OWL-demarcated,
    semantics for each IoT platform or artifact that is to interoperate, communicate
    and collaborate. An infrastructure that translates messages/data/communication
    from its native format to the common format used across the INTER-IoT infrastructure:
    an IoT Platform Semantic Mediator (IPSM) component that will be responsible for
    translating incoming information, representing semantics of artifact X to semantics
    of artifact Y. The IPSM will use ontological alignments to perform ontology-to-ontology
    translations. The existence of a common modular ontology of INTER-IoT, called
    GOIoTP [26]. The IoT Platform Semantic Mediator (IPSM) is a software component
    that performs semantic translation of data. In the context of the INTER-IoT, it
    is used to translate semantics of messages exchanged by IoT artifacts (platforms,
    gateways, applications, etc.) within the INTER-IoT software. It is composed of
    the IPSM Core and auxiliary components, i.e. Semantic Annotators, and exposes
    a REST API (for configuration). An additional Communication Infrastructure is
    required to enable communication between the IPSM and all other “artifacts” that
    are to use its semantic translation services. The Semantic Annotators are located
    between the “outside world” and the IPSM. Their role is to produce RDF triples
    from data that they receive, e.g. from Bridges (component of MW2MW layer and the
    INTER-IoT middleware), and forward them to the IPSM Core through the Communication
    Channels, instantiated within the Communication Infrastructure. The IPSM Core
    performs the semantic translation of the RDF data, by applying pre-stored alignments
    (representing relationships between input and output ontologies). An instance
    of the IPSM can concurrently “service” multiple “conversations” taking place in
    separate Communication Channels. To achieve this goal, it can communicate with
    multiple instances of Semantic Annotators at the same time. Furthermore, each
    Alignment Applicator services a single Communication Channel and applies a separate
    alignment within the context of such channel. Communication Channels work in publish-subscribe
    mode, which allows a single channel to serve both, one-to-one and one-to-many
    communication. Figure 5.2 Semantic Inter-Platform Ontology-to-Ontology translation
    through IPSM. 5.3.4 Methodology and Tools for Guiding the Implementation A novel
    aspect of INTER-IoT is that provides a methodology to guide and ease the INTER-IoT
    framework implementation. The INTER-METH methodology eases and offers guidance
    on the implementation of INTER-IoT in order to integrate different heterogeneous
    IoT platforms [10]. This makes it possible to achieve interoperability among the
    aforementioned IoT platforms and thus it enables to deploy fully functional IoT
    applications on top of them. There are currently no methodological approaches
    that might enable platform integration in a systematic and comprehensive way.
    It is a well-known truism that the utilization of an engineering methodology is
    of foremost importance at any domain (e.g. civil engineering, software engineering),
    maximizes, and ensures the effectiveness of the processes and actions to be performed.
    In sharp contrast with that, trying to manually apply complex techniques and methods
    in order to achieve platform integration would of necessity result in an unacceptably
    high rate of errors and bugs, which may instead be precluded via systematization
    and automation. The structure of the INTER-METH process can be seen in Figure
    5.3. It is iterative in nature and comprises six successive stages: Analysis,
    Design, Implementation, Deployment, Testing and Maintenance. In principle, the
    output of each stage is the input of the following one. But in practice and depending
    on the particular circumstances being dealt with, is it possible to loop only
    specific steps of the process or else sets of successive ones, facilitating the
    adaptation to new components, and providing flexibility to this technique. Figure
    5.3 Process schema of INTER-METH. Additionally, INTER-IoT provides a set of tools,
    named INTER-CASE, that guide the implementation of the INTER-IoT framework, explaining
    the methodology for each specific implementation case. This set of programs offer
    step-to-step assessment and guidance in this process. Figure 5.4 MW2MW structure.
    5.3.5 Middleware for the Interconnection of Platforms This interoperability middleware
    has syntactic translators (bridges) that are able to convert the specific data
    format employed by an IoT platform to the INTER-IoT data format (JSON-LD), and
    vice versa. Thus, INTER-IoT middleware can provide syntactic interoperability
    among different IoT platforms. Platforms are therefore able to send or receive
    flows of information in a data format understandable for them. INTER-IoT MW2MW
    represents a solution for interconnecting platforms at middleware level, and to
    enable interoperability among them [7]. In regard to the middleware structure
    (Figure 5.4), south from the Communication and Control block, the bridges manage
    the communication with the underlying platforms by translating requests and answers
    from and into messages for the queue. Different bridges might need to use HTTP,
    REST, sockets or other technologies to talk to the platforms, but these will be
    translated northwards into messages. They also pass the message content to the
    IPSM, which is a service external to MW2MW that will allow for ontological and
    format translation between the platforms and a common language. In the services
    group of components, the most important are the Platform Registry and Capabilities,
    that contains the information of all connected Platforms including their type
    and service capabilities, the Resource Discovery that creates requests to obtain
    the necessary information from the platforms, and the Resource Registry, that
    contains a list of resources (e.g. devices) and their properties that can be quickly
    consulted. In the second phase, the Routing and Roaming Service will be expected
    to allow the communication with a particular device independently of the platform
    it is currently connected to, while Authentication and Accountability (not shown)
    would provide services for the security and monitoring of all the actions. 5.3.6
    Virtual Gateway INTER-IoT provides a smart gateway that has the particularity
    that is partially virtual. This gateway provides IoT interoperability at the device
    level and has a modular design. Modularity in protocols and access networks is
    optimal. Any access network, protocol or middleware module can be inserted into
    the structure as long as its interface matches with the controller. The device
    is build up in a way that once the system structure is functional a split-up can
    be realized. Part of the device gateway can be placed in the virtual world to
    allow device activity to higher level at all time. The device dispatcher will
    take care of connecting or simulating the actual platform. When connection is
    lost, the virtual part remains functional and will answer to requests of API and
    INTER-IoT middleware. At the lowest level there are sensors and actuators. These
    are connected to the different input modules. These modules take care of connectivity
    with wireless smart objects. This smart software gateway provides interoperability
    among very different network technologies and protocols. In addition to Wi-Fi
    and Bluetooth, INTER-IoT gateway supports network protocols and technologies specifically
    designed for IoT, such as CoAP, MQTT, LoRa and IQRF, as well as advanced techniques
    for oﬄoading. Moreover, it is able to support the recent network protocol Multipath
    TCP [11], which is thought to be the successor of TCP in the Future Internet [12,
    13], and it is massively used in smartphones due to its capability of bandwidth
    aggregation from different networks [13, 14] (e.g. such as 3G and Wi-Fi networks).
    Figure 5.5 Gateway structure and inner components. 5.4 Inter-Iot Use Cases and
    Applications INTER-IoT has two pilots INTER-LogP, as an interoperable solution
    in the seaport scenario, for port management, and INTER-Health, associated with
    the domain of e-Health. Figure 5.6 INTER-Health pilot. 5.4.1 e-Health (INTER-Health)
    The INTER-IoT approach is case-driven, and it is implemented and tested in realistic
    large-scale pilots. One of its pilots, INTER-Health, is focused on the use case
    of INTER-IoT on e-Health [10], and it is tested on an Italian National Health
    Centre for m-health, involving 200 patients equipped with body sensor networks,
    wearable sensors and mobile smart devices for health monitoring. This use case
    is based on the integration of two e-Health IoT platforms, and its goal is the
    development of an e-Health system through the integration of several IoT platforms
    and medical sensors. This system aims to monitor people’s lifestyle in a decentralized
    and mobile manner for the prevention of health issues such obesity, caused by
    unappropriated diet and lack of physical activity [15]. These monitoring processes
    are meant to be decentralized from the healthcare centre to the monitored subjects’
    homes and supported in mobility by using on-body physical activity monitors. It
    is worth noting that, the strategic importance of such complete use case, is largely
    motivated by the fact that unhealthy lifestyles such as improper and hypercaloric
    diet and insufficient physical activity, are at the base of main chronic diseases
    [16, 17]. During the use case experimentation, the effectiveness of the novel
    system, in terms of lifestyle improvement indices, will be evaluated with respect
    to the current “manual” monitoring performed by conventional Healthcare Centres.
    5.4.1.1 Lifestyle monitor: Medical perspective There are a variety of indicators
    to measure and observe for preventing and/or detecting obesity, following the
    medical protocol given by the World Health Organisation (WHO) [16, 17]. Through
    these indicators, it is possible to determine the health status in terms of appropriate
    or inappropriate weight (levels vary from underweight, normal weight, overweight
    to obesity). These measurements can be collected in health centres by a healthcare
    worker (dietist or doctor). These include objective measurements (body mass index,
    blood pressure, weight, height, waist circumference) and subjective indices (eating
    habits and the practise of physical activity) [15]. For these reasons, the goal
    of this use case is to monitor a person’s lifestyle in a decentralized manner
    with mobile sensors in order to prevent health issues. Specifically, the use case
    requires the monitoring of the following health indicators: The Body Mass Index
    (BMI) (weight/height2) is an objective indicator of the health state of the patient
    (underweight, normal weight, overweight, first level obesity, second level obesity
    and 3rd level obesity) of subjects, also allowing to make the diagnosis of overweight
    and obesity. The waist circumference is an objective indicator for the diagnosis
    of overweight and obesity; values over 80 cm in women and 94 cm in men are considered
    pathological. The physical activity practice is a subjective indicator that detect
    the amount (hours/daily and hours/week) and the type of physical activity (no
    activity; light, moderate and intense activity). This measure is used to detect
    a poor lifestyle with physical inactivity. The eating habits is a subjective indicator
    for measuring the quality and quantity of the diet. This measure is used to detect
    a poor lifestyle due to improper diet and high-calories. This use case will be
    deployed over the integrated system composed through the joint of the IoT e-Health
    platforms UniversAAL and BodyCloud. This will enable the computerized monitoring
    at the healthcare centre coupled with the monitoring at the patients’ homes [19],
    which would be supported by the UniversAAL remote services, while BodyCloud will
    allow to monitor subjects’ physical activity through BodyCloud mobile BSN services.
    5.4.1.2 Platforms to integrate BodyCloud BodyCloud [18] is an IoT platform specifically
    addressed to the creation and management of Body Sensor Networks (BSNs). It has
    a Software-as-a-Service architecture, and it is capable of creating a smart gateway
    on smart phone devices that are able to receive and monitor health rates from
    medical wearable sensors. BodyCloud supports the management and storage of body
    sensor data streams and the oﬄine and online analysis, of the stored data using
    software services hosted in the Cloud in order to enable large-scale data sharing
    and collaborations among users and applications in the Cloud and deliver Cloud
    services via sensor-rich mobile devices. BodyCloud endeavours to support a variety
    of specialized processing tasks and multi-domain applications and offers decision
    support services to take further actions based on the analysed BSN data. The BodyCloud
    approach is based on four main components: The Body-side refers to an Android-based
    element for the monitoring of assisted living by means of smart wearable medical
    sensors, and the collection and upload of data to the Cloud through a smart phone
    that acts as a mobile gateway. The Cloud-side is a Software-as-a-Service element
    that provides Cloud services, such as storage. The Viewer-side refers to the Web
    browser-enabled component for the visualization of data. The Analyst side facilitates
    the analysis of data and the creation of BodyCloud applications. UniversAAL The
    IoT platform UniversAAL [2] (Universal Ambient Assisted Living) is specifically
    designed for the domain of Ambient Assisted Living and medical environments. UniversAAL
    is a platform that enables the creation of assistive systems by connecting different,
    heterogeneous technical devices to a single, unified network. UniversAAL also
    delivers the means to control this distributed system. Well-defined semantics
    is an important concern in medical and AAL environments, to lead to no ambiguity
    in measurements, units and terms employed [13]. In this regard, UniversAAL utilizes
    semantics in a very strict and well-defined manner, unlike many other IoT platforms,
    and employs W3C SSN ontology for IoT and smart devices. [2] http://www.universaal.info
    Complementary Platforms The aforementioned IoT platforms (i.e. BodyCloud and UniversAAL)
    have several high-level characteristics in common and differing aims and technology.
    Both are e-Health platforms that employ Bluetooth technology to interact with
    sensors. Moreover, both platforms employ Cloud data storage, cloud big data analysis
    and data visualization. Though, the two platforms have different specific objectives
    and are not interoperable from a technological point of view. Their specific objectives
    are complementary: UniversAAL is focused on non-mobile remote monitoring based
    on non-wearable measurement devices, whereas BodyCloud provides monitoring of
    subjects in mobility through wearable devices organized as body sensor networks
    (BSN). Thus, their integration would produce a full-fledged m-Health platform
    atop of which multitudes of m-Health services could be developed and furnished.
    Figure 5.7 INTER-Health: BodyCloud and UniversAAL integration. 5.4.1.3 INTER-IoT
    integration of health platforms The integration of UniversAAL and BodyCloud is
    achieved through their interconnection through INTER-IoT, as can be seen on Figure
    5.7. This integration is done across three layers (device, application and semantics).
    The middleware layer of the resulting integrated IoT system is based entirely
    on UniversAAL thus no interconnection is required across different platforms.
    Therefore, INTER-IoT provides integration and transparent interconnection at the
    following levels: at device layer (D2D), enabling the new IoT system to communicate
    with the wireless medical devices supported by BodyCloud and with the fixed e-Health
    devices from the health centre or from the patients’ houses. at the application
    and services layer (AS2AS), the applications for handling patients’ reports the
    reports from UniversAAL are integrated in the overall systems in such a way that
    reports can be complemented with additional data from BodyCloud measurement applications.
    at the data and semantics layer (DS2DS), enabling semantic and syntactic interoperability
    among all platforms and systems. The integration scheme of the aforementioned
    IoT platforms by means of INTER-IoT can be seen on Figure 5.10. 5.4.1.4 INTER-Health
    technical functionalities The integrated IoT system has the following main functionalities:
    collection of objective (weight, height, body mass index, blood pressure or waist
    circumference) and subjective (questionnaires concerning the eating habits and
    the practice of physical activity) measures during the visits at the healthcare
    centre (based on UniversAAL); telemonitoring at the healthcare centre of subjective
    (questionnaires) and objective (weight, blood pressure, etc...) measures sent
    by the patients at home (based on UniversAAL platform); telemonitoring at the
    healthcare centre of the physical activities performed by patient at home with
    wearable devices (based on BodyCloud platform) report and visualization of all
    the measurements collected for analysis and interaction on treatments. Figure
    5.8 INTER-Health System overview. 5.4.1.5 INTER-Health pilot The main goal of
    the INTER-Health pilot is demonstrating how to foster a healthy lifestyle and
    how to prevent chronic diseases by monitoring subjects’ physical characteristics,
    nutritional behaviour and activity [15, 19, 20]. The pilot consists of 200 test
    subjects: 100 subjects following traditional monitoring without IoT devices and
    100 subjects with devices. The latter use the INTER-IoT solution. They attended
    a nutritional counseling session a medical and nutritional centre where their
    initial physical characteristics are measured, using IoT Devices on the premises
    (BMI, waist circumference, weight, blood pressure…). Each subject received a management
    program. Then at home, while they follow the program, they measure their characteristics
    using their phone and IoT devices. The subjects will visit the medical and nutritional
    centre each 6 month for check-ups. The healthcare professional in charge of monitoring
    each user will have access to the history of all the measurements through a dedicated
    web application. The assisted living environment created for INTER-Health enables
    the remote measurement of different physiological parameters by means of medical
    IoT devices such as weigh scale, blood pressure monitor and physical activity
    rate monitor [21, 22]. The aforementioned sensors interact with an IoT platform
    (BodyCloud or UniversAAL), and provide measurements through the connection with
    a smart gateway employing Bluetooth communication [23]. This smart gateway receives
    the measures from the devices and sends them to the platform via 2G/3G/4G/Wi-Fi/ADSL
    connectivity. The platform BodyCloud creates a smart gateway on a mobile phone,
    thus enables a smartphone to become an IoT gateway for the medical sensors. Doctors
    have access to a web medical application that allows them to follow up the monitoring
    of patients remotely at any moment, as well as to contact them via ITC communication
    tools (SMS, e-mail, telephone, and teleconference) and give medical assessment.
    5.4.1.6 Benefits INTER-IoT integration guarantees an effective and efficient interoperability
    between heterogeneous IoT platforms such as the two described e-Health IoT Platforms
    (i.e., UniversAAL and BodyCloud). The proposed interoperable approach will enable
    the development of new cross-platform services. Thus, the main benefit of the
    proposed approach consists of the availability of a more powerful IoT healthcare
    platform for lifestyle monitoring to implement new applications and services that
    the individual platforms could not support. Finally, the aforementioned monitoring
    process can be decentralized from the healthcare centre to the monitored subjects’
    homes, and supported in mobility by using on-body physical activity monitors connected
    to the novel fully integrated IoT environment. This approach, would reduce both
    the transfer costs of patients at medical centres and the waiting times, also
    obtaining constantly updated results to make the necessary adjustments in a faster
    and precise manner. From a final user perspective, INTER-Health use case significantly
    benefits from INTER-IoT solutions: For outpatients subjects: improving the survey
    quality of their health status; improve the definition of risk behaviour; provide
    information on diets and physical activity more relevant with the health status
    and with the risks of the subject compared to the traditional methods; increasing
    the sensitivity of the screening of subjects who need intervention from the local
    doctor or of the hospitals (second and third level obesity, diabetes, etc); reduce
    the time spent in face-to-face contact with the nutritional outpatient and the
    number of travels. For public health services: increase efficiency with the same
    resources used; increase effectiveness through standardization of objective and
    subjective measurements; turning subjective ones, such as activity practice, into
    objective ones (by exploiting IoT wearable systems); enlarge the number and type
    of subjects that appeal to nutritional outpatient. For local doctors: lighten
    the taking charge of healthy subjects by the local doctor for guaranteeing greater
    availability toward pathological subjects; overall, the local doctor becomes a
    vehicle from a lower general incidence of healthcare costs on the income of citizens,
    improve the care and diagnostics efficiency making directly available on the computer
    system of the local doctor, the data present on the platform used from the nutritional
    ambulatory. 5.4.2 Smart Transport & Logistics (INTER-LogP) INTER-IoT has a pilot,
    called INTER-LogP, focused on a use case of Smart Transport & Logistics. INTER-IoT
    offers an interoperable solution in the seaport scenario for port management [7,
    24]. The main objective of this pilot is to provide a service to control port
    access, monitor traffic and assist the operations at the port. Several systems
    will be able to identify trucks and drivers using different devices. This information
    can be shared under certain predefined rules through interoperability between
    the platforms involved; it can be used to monitor trucks inside the port by the
    Port Authority platform (due to security and safety purposes), and to manage more
    efficiently resources in the terminal. Moreover, this information is employed
    to avoid queues in the access gates to the port and the terminal. The use IoT
    platforms in ports can potentially enable traffic and container monitoring, geolocation
    of cargo and vehicles, management of storage and cargo processes and improvement
    of services. These benefits can be multiplied through appropriate sharing of valuable
    information and cooperation among the different IoT platforms in port environments,
    creating synergies. This use case addresses the need of IoT platforms interoperation
    within port actors: such as container terminals, transport companies (road and
    maritime transportation), the port authority, and customers. This pilot has been
    deployed in the port of Valencia, the most important port of the Mediterranean.
    The pilot is mainly composed by an Access Control System, and a Health Emergency
    System, which are possible fruit of the interoperability among platforms provided
    by INTER-IoT. The platforms integrated through INTER-IoT belong to the main actors
    of the port: IoT platforms of the Port Authority, of one of the Port Container
    Terminal (NOATUM Valencia), and Intelligent Transportation Systems of several
    Road Haulier Companies. This interconnection is set at middleware level, employing
    the INTER-IoT MW2MW solution [7]. Figure 5.9 INTER-LogP use case approach. Figure
    5.10 Integration of IoT platforms of different port stakeholders through INTER-IoT.
    Important platforms and systems involved are: In the Container Terminal : SEAMS
    : IoT platform for controlling container terminal machinery TOS : Terminal Operating
    System that controls and handles data associated to any terminal operation (Big
    Data) From the Port of Valencia : PORTCDM : Intelligent transportation system
    for the management of ships arrivals to the port From the Road Haulier Companies
    Different Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) This interconnection provides
    interoperability at middleware level, and flows of relevant information can be
    shared among platforms to enhance services and processes in the port. The enhancement
    of the access control to the port facilities is explained in the next subsection.
    Also, a new service combining e-Health emergencies and port transportation is
    described in this section. 5.4.2.1 Pilot for access control at the port area The
    interoperation of the platforms of main port stakeholders can bring very significant
    enhancement to the services related with the access control to the port facilities.
    Appropriate sharing of information and interoperation among them lead to a more
    efficient access control in terms of time and cost efficiency, security, safety,
    minor waiting times and improved management. Platforms integrated through INTER-IoT
    are from diverse entities from the port environment: the port, a container terminal
    (NOATUM) and several road haulier transportation companies. Relevant information
    shared among platforms are the location of trucks inside the port, information
    regarding load and unload operations, and access controls. The main benefits from
    these services are the collection and analysis of data regarding queues, congestion
    and temporary distribution of traffic, and to manage efficiently the resources.
    Relevant information obtained is the position of the trucks inside the port facilities,
    and its use it is important in the sake of safety and security. All these data
    can be shared between the port authority and the port terminals to improve operations.
    Figure 5.11 High-level view of the access control pilot. Figure 5.12 High-level
    scheme of the pilot for health accident assistance in port areas. 5.4.2.2 Pilot
    for health accident at the port area Starting from the access control pilot, trucks
    will be monitored once they enter in the port facilities. The Emergency Warning
    System (EWS) will be monitoring the data coming from the truck and the driver.
    In case it detects an accident or a medical problem, EWS will publish a notification
    to the port authority in a standard format (EDXL). Once the emergence control
    centre receives the notification, it will be possible to communicate with the
    driver through a push to talk protocol in the driver’s mobile. The main benefits
    we can get from this scenario are: apply in the port communications a standard
    format in accident reporting like EDXL, real-time identification of the location
    of the accident, direct communication with the closest control centre when an
    accident occurs and monitoring driver’s health if it is necessary. 5.4.3 Active
    and Healthy Ageing (ACTIVAGE) ACTIVAGE [27] is a H2020 LSP project that addresses
    the use of IoT technologies in the Active & Healthy Ageing (AHA) domain [25].
    INTER-IoT framework is a core element in the ACTIVAGE system that enables interoperability
    at different levels and fulfills the ACTIVAGE’s needs of interoperability. 5.4.3.1
    ACTIVAGE: Active and healthy ageing initiative ACTIVAGE project addresses the
    use of IoT technologies in the Active & Healthy Ageing (AHA) domain [25]. The
    objective of this project is to prolong and support the independent living of
    older adults in their cities and homes and responding to real needs of caregivers,
    service providers and public authorities. Hence, this project aims to improve
    the autonomy and quality of life of older adults and contribute to the sustainability
    of the health and care systems. The ACTIVAGE project has been designed as a Multi
    Centric Large-Scale Pilot consisting of nine interconnected Deployment Sites (DS)
    distributed over seven European countries. A DS can be defined as a cluster of
    stakeholders in the AHA value network, working together within a geographical
    space. Therefore, a DS includes users (elderly people, formal and informal caregivers),
    service providers, AHA services, health care/social care administration and technological
    infrastructures and technology providers. The DS make use of existing open and
    proprietary IoT platforms. Each DS utilizes a specific IoT platform, or two. The
    different IoT platforms employed in ACTIVAGE DS are FIWARE, SOFIA2, UniversAAL,
    SensiNact, OpenIoT, IoTivity and SENIORSOME. The following DS have been defined
    in the ACTIVAGE project: DS1: Galicia (Spain) will make use of the SOFIA2 platform.
    DS2: Valencia (Spain) will provide services based on a combination of data from
    UniversAAL and Fiware platforms. DS3: Madrid (Spain) will deploy services based
    on UniversAAL. DS4: Region Emilia Romagna (Italy) will make use of the Fiware
    platform. DS5: Greece will offer services based on the IoTivity platform DS6:
    Isére (France) will provide services based on the SensiNact platform. DS7: Woqaz
    (Germany) will develop services based on the UniversAAL platform. DS8: Leeds (UK)
    will deploy services based on the IoTivity platform. DS9: Finland will make use
    of the proprietary IoT platform SENIORSOME. Due to the lack of interoperability
    among IoT platforms, the definition of an interoperability framework is needed
    in order to create a European AHA ecosystem. Figure 5.13 AHA Interoperable DS
    (Smart Home Clusters). With this aim, ACTIVAGE will develop the ACTIVAGE IoT Ecosystem
    Suite (AIoTES), which is defined as a set of tools, techniques and methodology
    for interoperability between existing IoT platforms. The AIoTES Framework will
    provide interoperability among IoT platforms and ensure security and privacy.
    The different DS will connect to AIoTES and AHA applications will be deployed
    over this framework, thus allowing the integration of remote health-care services
    and wearable systems-based health-care services in mobility, which will include
    remote medical measurements, local mobile physical detection and processing, and
    on-line and off-line analysis of lifestyle data. ACTIVAGE aims to achieve interoperability
    at three stages: Intra-deployment site interoperability, which means that the
    services provided at each DS must be interoperable to each other. In order to
    achieve this, any the application should be able to access all the application
    data within the same DS. Moreover, the applications within a DS should support
    multiple IoT platforms and be able to be transferred between different platforms
    within s DS. Figure 5.14 AHA Architecture for Interoperability. Inter-deployment
    site interoperability: enables new services to be automatically incorporated into
    the ecosystem of the DS. This means that different DS should be able to exchange
    application data. Moreover, it should be possible to transfer an application that
    was designed for a DS to a different DS and new applications could be developed
    for multiple DS instead of being designed for a particular DS. Interoperable external
    adopted solutions: according to the needs of each specific DS, new solutions will
    be implemented within the DS. They will be interoperable according to the ACTIVAGE
    interoperability framework. These goals imply that the same data format must be
    used by the applications regardless of the IoT platforms being used in the DSs
    so as the applications can access any platform’s data. Moreover, applications
    initially development for a DS can be extended for any other DS only by adapting
    them to AIoTES instead of making an adaptation for each individual platform. Overall,
    multiple AHA applications and IoT platforms may coexist in the same DS, thus contributing
    to fulfil the main goal of a DS. Therefore, it is required inter-platform and
    intra-platform interoperability among the different IoT platforms of the DS of
    this AHA intiative (FIWARE, UniversAAL, SOFIA2, OpenIoT, IoTivity and Seniorsome).
    Furthermore, this interoperability must be both syntactic and semantic, to allow
    the understandability of the information across platforms and a common interpretation
    of data shared among them. In this regard, INTER-IoT is the key component that
    makes it possible for the ACTIVAGE deployment to enable and ensure platform interoperability
    in DSs. The required interoperability among IoT platforms is provided by the Semantic
    Interoperability Layer (SIL), which is a component of the AIoTES framework. INTER-IoT
    is the key component that provides inter-platform interoperability in this AHA
    deployment. Two components of INTER-IoT, namely, the MW2MW layer and the DS2DS
    layer (composed by the IPSM), have been incorporated in the SIL. The MW2MW layer
    connects to all the IoT platforms and provides a common abstraction layer to provide
    access to platform’s features and information. An important function of the MW2MW
    is to convert the data to a common syntax, which is based on JSON-LD. Once the
    data is in the common format, the IPSM performs semantic translations. As a result,
    AIoTES provides semantic and syntactic interoperability among the different platforms,
    and enables information sharing and interoperation among them. This data shared
    will be understandable for the receiver platform, not only in terms of data format
    but also regarding the meaning of the received information. In addition to these
    INTER-IoT components, the AIoTES framework includes an API, security and privacy
    protection components management functions. Security and privacy span across all
    the components of AIoTES in order to ensure the protection of sensitive data against
    unauthorized access. AIoTES management provides a set of tools that allow access
    to the information of a DS, such as platforms and devices, and mechanisms to facilitate
    the integration of the framework. Finally, AIoTES will provide a common API, which
    will allow a homogeneous access to the components of AIoTES in order to develop
    services and applications able to exchange data from different IoT platforms and
    produce new added value services. Hence, the AIoTES API will make possible the
    development of and ecosystem based on applications and services compatible with
    AIoTES. 5.4.3.2 Use Cases of ACTIVAGE AAL and AHA systems can very significantly
    benefit from interoperability [31, 32]. The following Reference Use Cases respond
    to specific user needs (senior people and caregivers), to improve their quality
    of life and autonomy, in a AHA context, that require IoT interoperability: Daily
    activity monitoring at home for informal caregivers support and for formal caregivers
    follow up in order to alert them about deviations of the elderly persons’ habits,
    allowing early interventions while extending independency. Wireless sensors like
    presence, magnetic contact, power measurement, proximity, are deployed at the
    home of the elderly. A gateway transmits the information to a Cloud where calculation
    on activities, trends and risks is performed. Integrated care for older adults
    under chronic conditions. This use case combines daily activity monitoring at
    home and the use of medical devices for health monitoring. The combination of
    IoT technologies with eHealth solutions in one single integrated IT system, and
    the integration of care protocols from entities traditionally working separately
    will promote the coordination among care providers, joint response to emergencies,
    better planning of resources and more effective interventions. This will lead
    to economic savings and a better quality of life for people with chronic disease.
    Monitoring assisted persons outside home and controlling risky situations. This
    use case combines wearable devices or smartphones and the Smart City infrastructure
    in order to promote socialization and activity. The Smart City infrastructure
    tracks the wearable devices and request for help if certain rules are met in order
    to help persons at risk. Emergency trigger. The system automatically reports an
    emergency when a critical situation is detected. Wireless or wired sensors and
    “panic” buttons distributed in the home environment in strategic situations linked
    to a gateway that forwards the emergency to a call-centre system. Other complex
    scenarios might involve the processing of data in the private or hybrid cloud
    and then the emergency is triggered. Compared to state-of-the-art systems at home,
    emergency works when the user requests for help, but also when the environment
    detects the emergency and the person cannot (unconsciousness, fall, gas). Exercise
    promotion for fall prevention and physical activeness using wearable and ambient
    sensors. Cognitive stimulation for mental decline prevention in order to extend
    the time elderly people live independently. This use case combines behavioural
    monitoring at home and outside, and interventions, such as the promotion of mental
    and physical exercises and gaming, making use of apps in tablets or smartphones
    and peripheral connected devices. Prevention of social isolation by means of communication
    tools at home. This use case promotes social interaction and mobility though the
    use of video-based system and apps connected to the Smart City infrastructure,
    which provides data about events, and linking to other peers. In addition, continuity
    between home (home sensors) and outdoors scenarios (smart phone as a sensor) provides
    seamless information about users’ social activity. Social engagement keeps depression
    and decline away. Comfort and safety at home. This use case includes climate and
    light control, perimeter safety, energy control and home automation. Support for
    transportation and mobility. This use case includes adapted route planning for
    elderly persons both in cities and between different cities. Routes can be computed
    making use of the Smart City data about traffic conditions and other mobility
    aspects and personalized according to goals such as exercise promotions or finding
    the easiest/fastest route. 5.4.4 Other Potential Use Cases INTER-IoT can be employed
    in any domain or across domains where there is a need of IoT interoperability.
    Thus, its use is not limited to the aforementioned use cases and can be utilized
    in the most various IoT environments, allowing very different aims that are enabled
    or partially enabled through interoperability. A clear example is the Smart Cities
    use case, which greatly benefits from the synergies and cooperation among different
    systems and platforms that provide different city services. In this case, there
    is an enormous need of interconnection that is limited by the typical interoperability
    problems in the IoT realm. The application of the INTER-IoT framework is able
    to solve the integration of heterogeneous platforms and systems within a Smart
    City, provide numerous benefits to the citizens and enable the creation of new
    useful services fruit of this interoperability. 5.5 Conclusions and Outlook In
    this chapter, it has been described the current problem of lack of interoperability
    in the heterogeneous Internet of Things realm, and the usefulness of INTER-IoT
    for solving this important problem and enabling the integration and interoperation
    of heterogeneous IoT platforms at all layers and across multiple domains. The
    effective application of INTER-IoT for solving the lack of interoperability among
    platforms has been explained and demonstrated in several use cases associated
    to different application domains. First, the usefulness of INTER-IoT has been
    analysed in a e-Health and AAL use case, in which the interoperability framework
    is implemented. In this regard, INTER-IoT enables the integration and interoperability
    of IoT platforms and provides a more powerful solution that the individual solution
    provided by each one of those platforms. These advantages are a consequence of
    the enablement of synergies and the sum of capabilities of all the integrated
    platforms. Second, INTER-IoT has been a key integrator element in an interoperable
    solution for efficient port management. This use case is focused on the domain
    of Transportation and Logistics. INTER-IoT enables the interconnection of several
    platforms at middleware level, and the syntactic and semantic interoperability
    of any information shared among them, despite of the different data formats, standards,
    message structure and semantics. Because of this interconnection of platforms
    and sharing of relevant data among key entities, several management processes
    in the port can be very significantly improved. Also, the interoperability provided
    by INTER-IoT demonstrates that enables the existence of new services, fruit of
    the new information sharing and the possibilities of cooperation among platforms.
    Third, INTER-IoT interoperability framework is employed in an AHA and AAL use
    case for enabling an assisted living environment in elder homes, to allow ancient
    people to live at home in a safe and autonomous way. INTER-IoT allows different
    IoT platforms to interoperate with the ACTIVAGE system around Europe, to enable
    this autonomous life of elderly people. Finally, other potential use cases are
    mentioned, as far as INTER-IoT framework can be successfully employed in any domain
    and use case that has a need of IoT interoperability at any level (e.g. Smart
    Cities). Regarding implementation aspects, INTER-IoT employs several innovative
    elements to provide enhanced functionality and has clear positive differentiators
    from other interoperability approaches. First, INTER-IoT has a layered approach
    to guarantee tight interoperability on each of the different layers (device, network,
    middleware, application, data and semantics), compared to a more global approach.
    Also, due to this multilayer approach, any of the INTER-IoT layer solutions can
    be employed in a standalone way, providing more flexibility and adaptation to
    specific IoT cases. Additionally, to guarantee a quick and easy implementation,
    INTER-IoT gives the option of running virtualized interoperability solutions for
    each layer through Docker. This virtualization enormously facilitates the deployment
    of the INTER-IoT solutions. Moreover, INTER-IoT has a huge concern on security,
    and layer solutions and APIs are securitized. The INTER-IoT interoperability framework
    provides innovative elements, such as a universal semantic platform-to-platforms
    translator, a middleware that enables the interconnection and interoperation of
    any platform at middleware level, despite of the standards and formats employed,
    and a partially virtualized gateway. Furthermore, INTER-IoT implementation is
    guided and eased through a novel methodology (INTER-METH) specifically designed
    with this aim. Interoperability in IoT, and more specifically among platforms,
    represents one of the most important challenges in IoT, and interoperability solutions
    such as INTER-IoT can potentially unlock immense benefits from the use of smart
    technology, and a huge integrator and enabler of services on top of IoT deployments.
    INTER-IoT can be used in the middle future to enable interoperability solutions
    among the most diverse use cases and domains in which IoT interoperability is
    required, solving modern society problems to let technology improve people’s daily
    life, and propel European economy. Also, INTER-IoT facilitates a key element for
    the evolution of IoT; interoperability is essential for the creation of natural
    human interfaces in IoT systems, the existence of Ambient Intelligent Environments
    or the integration of IoT with Artifical Intelligence. Acknowledgements This work

    modern production processes are nowadays equipped with cyber-physical systems
    in order to capture, manage, and process large amounts of sensor data including
    information about machines, processes, and products. The proliferation of cyber-physical
    systems (CPS) and the advancement of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies have
    led to an explosive digitization of the industrial sector. Driven by the high-tech
    strategy of the federal government in Germany, many manufacturers across all industry
    segments are accelerating the adoption of cyber-physical system and IoT technologies
    to gain actionable insight into their industrial production processes and finally
    improve their processes by means of data-driven methodology. In this work, we
    aim to give insights into our recent research regarding the domains of Smart Data
    and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). To this end, we are focusing on the
    EU projects MONSOON and COMPOSITION as examples for the Public-Private Partnership
    (PPP) initiatives Factories of the Future (FoF) and Sustainable Process Industry
    (SPIRE) and show how to approach data analytics via scalable and agile analytic
    platforms. Along these analytic platforms, we provide an overview of our recent
    Smart Data activities and exemplify data-driven analysis of industrial production
    processes from the process and manufacturing industries. 6.1 Introduction Many
    modern production processes are nowadays equipped with cyber-physical systems
    in order to capture, manage, and process large amounts of sensor data. These sensor
    data include information about machines, processes, and products and are encountered
    in form of data streams. These data streams from the production site are then
    frequently integrated into cloud-based solutions by means of Internet of Things
    technologies in order to allow comprehensive data-driven investigations and process
    optimizations. The proliferation of cyber-physical systems and the advancement
    of IoT technologies have led to an explosive digitization of the industrial sector.
    Driven by the high-tech strategy of the federal government in Germany, many manufacturers
    across all industry segments are accelerating the adoption of cyber-physical systems
    and Internet of Things technologies in order to gain actionable insight into industrial
    production processes and finally improve these processes by means of data-driven
    methodology. The IoT is one of the key enabler for intelligent manufacturing and
    production. It facilitates the intelligent connectivity of smart embedded devices
    in factories and shop floors. Endowing the manufacturing and production site with
    technologies from the IoT, which is then also referred to as the IIoT, has become
    a technical prerequisite for a sustainable and competitive industrial production
    of the future. Digitizing the industrial sector with cyber-physical systems, Internet
    of Things technologies, cloud computing services, and Smart Data analytics leads
    to the fourth industrial revolution, which is denoted as Industry 4.0. The importance
    of strengthen the European industry to become more sustainable and competitive
    is also taken into account by the European Commission. Within the EU Framework
    Programme for Research and Innovation the two Public-Private Partnership (PPP)
    initiatives Factories of the Future (FoF) and Sustainable Process Industry (SPIRE)
    aim to (i) help EU manufacturing enterprises to adapt to global competitive pressures
    by developing the necessary key enabling technologies across a broad range of
    sectors and (ii) support EU process industry in the development of novel technologies
    for improved resource and energy efficiency. Turning industrial Big Data into
    structured and useable knowledge is one of the major data-centric challenges for
    enhancing production processes. Integrating data from heterogeneous systems and
    gaining insight into voluminous amounts of streaming sensor data with high variety
    and velocity requires scalable methods and techniques. Structuring knowledge in
    a way that it can be used to manage and improve industrial production processes
    is one of the objectives of Smart Data analytics. By improving Big Data to a higher
    degree of quality, Smart Data analytics aims to understand the following aspects:
    Purpose: What problem to solve with the data? People: Who is involved? Processes:
    What are the surrounding processes? Platform: Which IT infrastructure is necessary
    for realization? The aforementioned aspects are also referred to as the 4Ps of
    Smart Data. They indicate the information to be gathered in addition to the sensor
    data from the production site in order to get a more complete understanding about
    the data and its surrounding entities. It is obvious that addressing the 4Ps within
    the Smart Data analytics process strongly relies on user-centered methods since
    many of the required information need to be discovered from non-documented data.
    The Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Information Technology FIT has been conducting
    research and development on user-friendly smart solutions that blend seamlessly
    in business processes for about 30 years and has a strong experience in digitization,
    Industry 4.0 projects and IoT solutions. Having about 160 researchers with different
    scientific background, the Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Information Technology
    FIT is organized into five research departments: The User-Centered Computing department
    develops IT systems and technologies that focus on their users throughout their
    complete life cycle. Current work focuses on usability engineering, web compliance,
    and accessibility. The Cooperation Systems department develops and evaluates groupware
    and community systems for virtual teams and organizations. Our work on hardware
    and software of Mixed and Augmented Reality systems focuses on support for cooperative
    planning tasks. The Life Science Informatics department designs and implements
    complex biomedical information systems and creates novel software solutions for
    manufacturers and users in health care, biotechnology, drug research and social
    services. Focal areas are image-based navigation systems, information-intensive
    optical instruments, visual information analysis, multi-parametric molecular sensor
    technology and diagnostics as well as bio-analogue analysis of changing images.
    The Risk Management and Decision Support department offers decision and process
    support for application domains whose processes can be characterized by their
    high level of complexity as well as their weak determination of process structures.
    The Fraunhofer Project Group Business & Information Systems Engineering, located
    in Augsburg and Bayreuth, has proven expertise at the interface of Financial Management,
    Information Management and Business & Information Systems Engineering. The ability
    to combine methodological know-how at the highest scientific level with a customer-focused
    and solution-oriented way of working, is our distinctive feature. As part of User-Centered
    Computing department, the User-Centered Ubiquitous Computing group develops systems
    providing effective personal assistance that dynamically respond to user demands
    and at the same time adapt to new work practices. The group is focusing on the
    application domains Industry 4.0, Smart Cities and Energy Efficiency/Smart Grids
    and approach novel applied solutions via methods from the domains User-Centered
    Design, Internet of Things Platforms, and Smart Data. In this chapter, we aim
    to give insights into our recent research into the domains of Smart Data and Industrial
    Internet of Things. To this end, we are focusing on the following EU projects:
    The MONSOON (MOdel based coNtrol framework for Site-wide OptimizatiON of data-intensive
    processes) project aims to establish a data-driven methodology to support the
    identification and exploitation potentials by applying multi-scale model based
    predictive controls in production processes. It offers an integrated real-time
    and dependable infrastructure easing in improving the efficient use and re-use
    of raw resources and energy across plant- and site-wide applications in heterogeneous
    and distributed production environments. EU funds it under SPIRE (Sustainable
    Process Industry through Resource and Energy Efficiency) research project that
    aims to develop an infrastructure in support of the process industries. The COMPOSITION
    (Ecosystem for COllaborative Manufacturing PrOceSses – Intra- and Interfactory
    Integration and AutomaTION) project has two main goals: The first goal is to integrate
    data along the value chain inside a factory into one integrated information management
    system (IIMS) combining physical world, simulation, planning and forecasting data
    to enhance re-configurability, scalability and optimisation of resources and processes
    inside the factory. The second goal is to create a (semi-)automatic ecosystem,
    which extends the local IIMS concept to a holistic and collaborative system incorporating
    and inter-linking both the Supply and the Value Chains. The COMPOSITION project
    is funded under the Factories of the Future PPP. In conjunction with both EU projects
    mentioned above, EXCELL is a twinning project addressing Big Data applications
    for cyber-physical systems in production and logistics Networks. The consortium
    of academics from Hungary, Great Britain, Belgium and Germany expands the scientific
    activities through central publications and active participation in scientific
    discourses. Priority Research Fields (PRFs) define the topic areas in which the
    partners work closely together to mutually train, support and empower each other
    with their knowledge and expertise. PRFs are for example cyber-physical systems
    and human system interaction, business-based Internet of Things and services,
    as well as data mining and data interoperability. In the remainder of this chapter,
    we will first describe our research activities and results with respect to the
    EU project MONSOON, which is an example for the process industry, in Section 6.2.
    Afterwards, we will continue with the EU project COMPOSITION, which is an example
    for the manufacturing/discrete industry, in Section 6.3. We finally conclude this
    chapter in Section 6.4. 6.2 Process Industry 6.2.1 Introduction The process industry
    is characterized by intense use of raw resources and energy, and thus represents
    a significant share of European industry in terms of energy, resources consumption
    and environment impact. In this area, even a small optimization can lead to high
    absolute savings, both economic and environmental. Predictive modelling techniques
    can be especially effective in optimization of production processes. However,
    the application of these techniques is not straightforward. Predictive models
    are built using the data obtained from production processes. In many cases, process
    industries must invest in the monitoring and data integration as well as in the
    development and maintenance of the underlying infrastructure for data analytics.
    Many other obstacles are also present, e.g., interoperability issues between software
    systems in production, difficulties in the physical monitoring of the production
    parameters, problems with the real-time handling of the data, or difficulties
    in defining relevant Key-Performance Indicators (KPIs) to support management.
    Therefore, the deployment of such predictive functions in production with reasonable
    costs requires consolidation of the available resources into shared cloud-based
    technologies. In the case of more flexible production environments, approaches
    that are even more significant are possible, such as the reinvention or redesign
    of the production processes. However, this is not applicable to major, capital-intensive
    process industries. In this case, the integration of innovations in the established
    production processes can be fundamental in their transformation from resource-consuming
    production into the “circular” model. 6.2.2 Reference Architecture The high-level
    conceptual view of the reference architecture that is developed within the scope
    of the project MONSOON is depicted in Figure 6.1. Figure 6.1 MONSOON Reference
    Architecture. The platform is able to inter operate with the heterogeneous existing
    systems deployed in process industries at different layers of the SCADA pyramid
    (Control, Supervision, Management, Enterprise). It includes sensors or controllers
    (PLCs), SCADA (Supervision control and data acquisition), Management Information
    Systems (MES) and Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP). There are two main components
    of the architecture. The Real-time Plant Operations Platform deployed on-site
    and supports data collection, storage and interaction with the production systems
    respecting relevant constraints and satisfying data-intensive conditions. The
    Cross-Sectorial Data Lab supports the development of new dynamic model base multi-scale
    controls. All the relevant data from the production site are transferred to the
    Data Lab where it is stored and processed for optimization of production process.
    To validate and demonstrate the results, two real environments are used within
    the project: an aluminium plant in France and a plastic factory in Portugal. We
    have identified two main use cases for both domains. For the aluminium sector,
    we focused on production of the anodes (positive electrodes) used in aluminium
    extraction by electrolysis. The first use case was targeted to predictive maintenance,
    where the main objective was to anticipate the breakdowns and/or highlight equipment/process
    deviations that affect the green anode final quality (e.g., anode density). The
    second use case dealt with the predictive anode quality control, where the goal
    was to identify bad anodes with a high level of confidence and scrap them to avoid
    sending them to the electrolysis area. For the plastic domain, the use cases are
    from the area of production of coffee capsules, produced in large quantities.
    In this type of production, it is important to produce the correct diameter and
    height of the coffee capsules and to make sure that the holes at the bottom of
    the capsules are formed properly. Moreover it is also expected to predict the
    failures of molding machines and their stoppages based on the process parameters
    and sensor measurements during molding processes. While the data analysis process
    for the plastic domain is described in Section 6.2.6, we provide a short description
    of main components of the MONSOON platform along with their interfaces in the
    next sections. 6.2.3 Plant Operational Platform The functional view of the architecture
    of the Plant Operations Platform is presented in Figure 6.2. It acts as an advanced
    semantic factory service bus and is in-charge of interacting with existing production
    systems deployed in a plant. The Plant Platform IT infrastructure and its associated
    Real-time Data Integration layer collect the operational raw data from the plant’s
    systems necessary to the execution of the predictive functions. The acquired operational
    raw data and associated relevant information is also routed to the data lab where
    it is stored and used for analytics. Figure 6.2 Functional View of Plant Operational
    Platform. 6.2.3.1 Real-time communication framework It configures the dependable
    real-time communication infrastructure necessary to support operations of prediction
    functions. The Monitoring Tools exploit and integrate existing solutions for real-time
    networking and QoS management and perform continuous (passive/active) monitoring
    of plant-wide process industry resources ensuring that communication-related malfunctions
    are properly detected. The Operation Data Visualization Dashboard provides a web
    user interface where operational managers can configure various real-time visualizations
    of operational data and monitor the deployed predictive functions. The visualized
    data can include operational data from the plant environment or predictions from
    the predictive functions executed in the Run-time Container. 6.2.3.2 Virtual process
    industries resources adapter The main function of the Virtual Process Industries
    Resources Adapter (VPIRA) is data integration, mediation and routing. The Connector
    allows the integration of data from various SCADA, MES and ERP systems deployed
    on the plant site. It ensures that all heterogeneous process industry resources
    and systems are easily accessed and managed. The Abstractor is a distributed and
    scalable data flow engine aiming for routing integrated data to multiple destinations,
    e.g., run-time container or data lab. Routing of data from the source to target
    connectors can be dynamic depending on the type of data or actual content. The
    data flows can be re-configured in a flexible way, connecting multiple sources
    to the multiple targets, overcoming any data heterogeneity problems. Besides the
    flexible configuration interface, the Virtual Process Industries Resources Adapter
    provide a flexible programming interface to simply implement connectors or processors
    for new types of data sources and formats. 6.2.3.3 Run-time container The Run-time
    Container executes the model based predictive functions and life-cycle management
    functions within the overall plant infrastructure. It ensures proper deployment
    and execution of predictive functions developed by means of the data lab, hence
    it manages all aspects of predictive functions life cycle. It is composed into
    four sub-components as described below: Data Orchestrator: coordinates the data
    flow between different components, such as transmit input data, store prediction
    result, and pass visualization result data to relevant components. Predictive
    Function: exports predictive function image from Function Repository and instantiate
    the execution of predictive function that perform real-time scoring of input operational
    data. It performs all operations required for the pre-processing of raw data into
    inputs for the specific predictive function and into process prediction output.
    Data Storage: stores the prediction results into a scalable database. The prediction
    results are also sent to the Operational Platform systems and the data lab for
    combining these real-time results with historical data analysis. Visualization
    Dashboard: displays prediction results and generates feedback instructions or
    alerts towards plant’s systems to inform/warn the site operators to adjust the
    process regulation parameters. 6.2.4 Cross Sectorial Data Lab Platform The Data
    Lab provides a collaborative environment where high amounts of data from multiple
    sites, and possibly from multitude of industry sectors, are collected, stored
    and processed in a scalable way. It enables multidisciplinary collaboration of
    experts allowing teams to jointly model, develop and evaluate distributed controls
    in rapid and cost-effective way. The Data Lab eases the definition of predictive
    control and life cycle management functions, allowing to work in a simulated environment
    or to exploit co-simulation by mixing stored data with data flowing in real-time
    from the real systems. The Data Lab thus supports data science and automation
    experts interested to optimization and scheduling aspects by providing the suitable
    environment to mine, process, re-play production data. It allows modelling of
    the whole production process across the SCADA layers including the specification
    of the data dictionary of all inputs and outputs of the processing steps and their
    relations to the overall KPIs. The semantic models capture the site knowledge
    base for given application cases and used data analytics methods allowing generalization
    of cases to existing good practices and transfer of the knowledge by adaptation
    of cases to new environment/site. The main outcome of the Data Lab is typically
    a single or multiple new predictive functions and life cycle management controls
    ready to be deployed in the Runtime Container of the Plant Operations Platform.
    Figure 6.3 Functional View of Cross Sectorial Data Lab Platform. The components
    of the Cross Sectorial Data Lab are shown in Figure 6.3 and explained in the sections
    below. 6.2.4.1 Big data storage & analytics platform The Big Data Storage and
    Analytics Platform provides resources and functionalities for storage as well
    as batch and real-time processing of the operational data from multiple site characterized
    as Big Data. The platform combines and orchestrates existing technologies from
    the Big Data and Analytic landscape and sets a distributed and scalable run-time
    infrastructure for the developed data analytics methods. It provides main integration
    interfaces between the site Operational Platform and the cloud Data Lab platform
    and the programming interfaces for the implementation of the data intensive analytics
    methods. The Big Data Storage and Analytics Platform consist of the following
    sub-components: Distributed Storage: provides a reliable, scalable file system
    with similar interfaces and semantics to access data as local file systems. Distributed
    Database: provides a structured view of the data stored in the platform using
    the standard SQL language, and supports standard RDBMS programming interfaces
    such as JDBC for Java or ODBC for Net platforms. Distributed Data Processing Framework:
    allows the execution of applications in multiple nodes in order to retrieve, classify
    or transform the arriving data. The framework provides Data Analytics APIs for
    processing large datasets via parallel and distributed computations. Data Ingestion:
    implements an interface for real-time communication between the Data Lab and Operation
    platforms. It also supports batch uploading of the historical data between the
    Data Lab and Operation platform. Security & Directory Service: provides user management
    and content authorization capabilities for the platform services. Management &
    Monitoring: provides the management, monitoring and provisioning of the platform
    services on the hosted environment. 6.2.4.2 Model development environment The
    Model Development Environment provides tools and interfaces that cover the whole
    life cycle of planning, implementation, testing, validation and deployment of
    predictive functions and life-cycle management controls into the plant production
    supporting simulation/co-simulation features. Development Tools: provide the main
    collaborative and interactive interface for data engineers, data analysts and
    data scientists to execute and interact with the data processing workflows running
    on the Data Lab platform. Using the provided interface, data scientists can organize,
    execute and share data, and code and visualize results without referring to the
    internal details of the underlying Data Lab run-time infrastructure. The interface
    is integrated in form of analytical “notebooks” where different parts of the analysis
    are logically grouped and presented in one document. These notebooks consist of
    code editors for data processing scripts and SQL queries, and interactive tabular
    or graphical presentations of the processed data. Semantic Modelling Framework:
    provides a common communication language between domain experts, stakeholders
    and data scientists. A collaborative web interface is provided for the creation
    and sharing of semantic models in order to use the knowledge expressed in such
    models for the optimization of the production processes in the Simulation and
    Resource Optimization Framework. Simulation Toolkit: supports validation and deployment
    of predictive functions in order to optimize overall KPIs defined for the production
    process. The estimation of overall impacts can be used to test various “what if”
    scenarios, or for the automatic discrete optimization of the production process
    by finding the optimal combination of predictive functions for various process
    phases. Resource Optimization Toolkit: optimizes the production process based
    on various indicators representing the performance of manufacturing process of
    the plant leveraging process data and knowledge extracted from analytics methods.
    Life-Cycle Management Plugin: serves as multi-disciplinary, transversal tool to
    evaluate environmental performance of a given production process for life-cycle
    environmental indicators, such as Global Warming Potential and Total Energy Requirement.
    Figure 6.4 Components Mapping to Open-source Technologies. 6.2.4.3 Function repository
    The Function Repository provides a storage for predictive functions together with
    all settings required for the deployment of predictive functions, where they are
    available for production deployment or for the simulations and overall optimization
    of the production processes. The predictive functions are packaged as container
    images so that entire predictive function pipeline (including pre-processing and
    task specific evaluation) can be implemented within a virtualized container. 6.2.5
    Deployment The Data Lab Platform promises to combine and orchestrate existing
    technologies and open source frameworks from the Big Data landscape to establish
    a distributed and scalable run-time infrastructure for the data analytics methods.
    We present in Figure 6.4 the mapping of the platform components to existing and
    emerging open source technologies selected and used during the initial deployment.
    The initial deployment was performed with multiple virtual machines on an in-house
    physical infrastructure. It turned out that the overall deployment time and configuration
    management is the most critical aspect in realizing and operationalizing such
    a platform. It would be optimal to devise a uniform deployment strategy taking
    into account different deployment options for the platform such as on-premises,
    cloud/external provider or hybrid. It has also been learned that different demonstrative
    and use-case scenarios in both aluminium and plastic domains pose different infrastructure
    and data requirements. Hence, it is useful to define different deployment pipelines
    or modes for the platform where the right set of platform services are deployed
    and orchestrated accordingly instead of full stack deployment. Towards this goal,
    the Big Data Storage and Analytics Platform has been containerized to adapt a
    common deployment ground with the objective of easing the usage of common platform
    technologies and make integration with other services or applications easy. The
    containerization based on Docker framework is depicted in Figure 6.5. Figure 6.5
    Containerization of Big Data Storage and Analytics Platform. The deployment of
    the Site Operational Platform with open source technologies mainly for Virtual
    Process Industries Resources Adaptor and Run-time Container is finally illustrated
    in Figure 6.6. It shows how predictive functions can be applied in factorial settings.
    Figure 6.6 Deployment view of Plant Operational Platform. 6.2.6 Data Analysis
    Data analysis in process industries mainly aims to reduce the wastage of time,
    resource and energy during production processes. This can be achieved by several
    means: avoiding equipment stoppages, maintaining optimum configurations, early
    detection of a chain of events causing an anomaly etc. Data analysis is simplified
    by the components of the Cross Sectorial Data Lab which provides a single platform
    for data fetching, accessing and artefact development. The data collected from
    the plastic molding machines are stored in the Big Data Storage & Analytic Platform.
    These data are used by the data scientists and the process experts for exploratory
    analysis in order to gain initial insights. The collaborative interface provided
    by the platform is used simultaneously by the process expert and the data scientists.
    The findings from the exploratory analysis is used as the basis for modelling
    the process leading to the development of predictive functions. These functions
    are stored in the Function Repository which are deployed later in factory premises
    for real-time predictions. Although this process is generic enough to be applied
    in any kind of industrial environment, we shall limit our discussion to the plastic
    industry. The objective of data analysis in the plastic industry is to anticipate
    the breakdowns and/or highlight equipment/process deviation that impacts the injection
    molding process and therefore to improve the quality of the produced coffee capsules.
    In general, there are two areas where waste parts can occur in plastic injection
    molding process: the molding tool and the molding process. During the long-term
    production of the coffee capsules, parameters of the injection molding process
    can slightly change due to various changes of the environment (temperature and
    humidity in the factory, deviations in the energy supply system, heating of oil
    temperature, deviations in the quality of the plastic granules, wearing of machine
    parts). The aim is to monitor technical parameters of the molding machine and
    raise an alarm if the deviation is increasing over the defined values. These long-term
    changes can also cause the stoppage of molding machines. Which in turn causes
    reduction of produced capsules. In addition, few of the initial cycles after restart
    are wasted during the calibration process producing defective capsules. 6.2.6.1
    Data description Two kinds of data have been collected in the first year from
    GLN site during the production of coffee capsules. The first data set is collected
    automatically from a Euromap63 interface recorded on molding machines and the
    second data set is collected during the experiments conducted by a process expert
    during their visit to the production site. The first data set is unlabeled and
    contains sensor measurements of several coffee capsule production cycles. Each
    cycle lasts almost 7 seconds, except if it causes a breakdown. The data set has
    a total of 88 attributes representing temperatures, time taken for different stages,
    pressure, cylinder positions etc. All data were directly monitored by the injection
    molding machine and stored there. Of them, only 12 (heating belt temperatures,
    maximum cycle pressure, coolant temperatures, residual melt cushion, plastification
    time) are proposed as useful, and, particularly, their ranges/deviations over
    intervals instead of their values themselves are suggested to serve as explanatory
    variables. The second data set [1] is manually labelled and comprises information
    about 250 production cycles of coffee capsules from the injection molding machine
    and their quality information. It contains 36 attributes reflecting the machine’s
    internal sensor measurements for each cycle. These measurements include values
    about the internal states, e.g. temperature and pressure values, as well as timings
    about the different phases within each cycle. In addition, we also take into account
    quality information for each cycle, i.e., the number of non-defect coffee capsules
    which changes throughout individual production cycles. The quality of each capsule
    is inspected by the domain expert in different aspects. i.e. the capsules have
    permissible range of height and base diameter. Also each capsule should have uniform
    thickness and should not have holes. If any of these expectations are not met,
    the capsule is considered to be defective. If the number of produced high quality
    coffee capsules is larger than a predefined threshold, we label the corresponding
    cycle with high.quality, and otherwise we assign the label low.quality. The decision
    about the quality labels was made by domain experts. Exploratory analysis is performed
    on the unlabeled data in order to discover hidden insights. On the other hand,
    basic machine learning algorithms are applied to the labelled data to classify
    the cycles based on their quality. In the upcoming subsections we discuss these
    two different approaches on these data sets. 6.2.6.2 Preliminary trend analysis
    of unlabeled data The main aim of the preliminary analysis of is to get some initial
    overall insights that might be interesting for the process experts to be further
    analyzed. The first step was to understand the attributes and their correlations.
    This was followed by visual exploration of data with manual inspection followed
    by clustering the data to find significant relation between different cycles.
    Considering the huge amount of data generated by sensors, clustering usually takes
    lots of time. One strategy is to use the computation powers of the Data Lab clusters
    to perform these operations faster. If the algorithms for exploratory data analysis
    are deployed in the Data Lab, domain experts and data scientists can use the results
    simultaneously to get actionable insights. One of the insight was repeating set
    of parameters in the data. This was found by using matrix profiles. A pattern
    obtained by applying matrix profiles is the decrease in plastification time and
    at the same time, increase in cycle time. Plastic domain expert cross checked
    these patterns and found out that this happens whenever there is an equipment
    stoppage due to lack of lubrication. Though the characteristics of these incidents
    are known, early prediction of the possible stoppage has not been found out with
    data analysis. The corresponding patterns are shown in Figure 6.7. Figure 6.7
    Increase in cycle time and decrease in plastification at the same time. The same
    pattern has repeated multiple times in the unlabelled set of plastic data. CycCycTim
    is cycle time and CycPlstTim is plastification time. Preliminary trend analysis
    helps us to extract the knowledge hidden in voluminous unlabelled data sets. This
    process can be automated to get the best results in minimum time. In addition,
    in the MONSOON project we include many stakeholders such as process experts, machine
    supervisors and ground workers to actively contribute to the production process
    optimization. This is achieved with the help of a centralized Big Data analytics
    platform. On deploying the knowledge discovery algorithms in the Big Data analytics
    platform, the stakeholders can give live feedbacks. The data scientists further
    use these feedbacks for deriving conclusions. This is an ongoing work as part
    of the project. 6.2.6.3 Machine learning for labelled data The goal of the machine
    learning process is to classify the injection molding cycles to high and low-quality
    cycles. As discussed earlier, the cycles are labelled as high.quality or low.quality
    based on the number of defective capsules produced in a cycle beyond a threshold
    defined by the process expert. The initial dataset is pre-processed as follows.
    The labelled data is first centred and scaled. Later, the number of attributes
    is reduced by excluding the ones with near zero variance. Principal Component
    Analysis is applied to the remaining attributes to get the projection of data
    in reduced number of dimensions. Basic classification algorithms, namely, k-Nearest
    Neighbour, Naïve Bayes, Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Random Forests
    and Support vector Machines (SVM) are investigated on the pre-processed data.
    SVM is investigated both with linear and RBF kernels. The performance of the models
    are measured in terms of balanced accuracy, precision, recall and F1 scores. K-fold
    cross validation is used to evaluate the performance. The number of folds is set
    to 5 and the number of repetitions is set to 100. We used 80% of the dataset is
    for training and 20% for testing. This investigation is performed via the CARET
    package in the programming language R. The results of our performance evaluation
    are summarized in Table 6.1. Table 6.1 Classification results of different predictive
    models Balanced Accuracy Precision Recall F1 score k-NN 0.697 0.638 0.686 0.657
    Naïve Bayes 0.643 0.604 0.563 0.578 CART 0.637 0.595 0.566 0.573 Random Forest
    0.653 0.619 0.570 0.589 SVM (linear) 0.632 0.626 0.488 0.540 SVM (RBF) 0.663 0.643
    0.563 0.594 From the table above, we see that all predictive models reach an accuracy
    of minimum 63%. The highest accuracy is achieved by the k-Nearest Neighbour classifier
    predicting the correct quality labels for more than 69% of the data. Albeit these
    results were satisfying, these algorithms cannot be deployed straight away as
    the data used for this performance evaluation has been manually labelled by the
    experts. In the situations where the capsules are produced in millions per day,
    it is wiser to use the automatically labelled data for training the models and
    deploy them afterwards. One approach is to use the decision of the visual inspection
    systems in order to label the data. But this is not trivial since there is no
    one to one mapping between the optical inspection systems data and the actual
    cycle data. This is because multiple capsules belonging to different cycles and
    machines are passed to the automatic visual inspection system at once making it
    harder to identify individual cycles belonging to a particular machine. 6.2.7
    Summary In this section, we have presented our recent research activities within
    the scope of the EU project MONSOON: As an example for the process industry, we
    have described the overall reference architecture facilitating cross-sectorial
    data analytics. As part of our ongoing work, we have also highlighted the analysis
    of sensor data arising from the plastic industry sector. In the following section,
    we will focus on the manufacturing industry. 6.3 Manufacturing/Discrete Industry
    6.3.1 Introduction As an example for the manufacturing industry, we focus on the
    EU project COMPOSITION. This project addresses the requirements of modern production
    processes, which stress the need of greater agility and flexibility leading to
    faster production cycles, increased productivity, less waste and more sustainable
    production. At the factory level, decisions need to be supported by detailed knowledge
    about the production process and its interplay with external entities. Unfortunately,
    historical and live data that generates this knowledge is becoming more and more
    distributed and few solutions are available that can easily tackle the implied
    challenges. Moreover, factories are becoming less isolated in the productive tissue
    of nations and several suppliers and third-party service providers need to be
    contacted and coordinated to implement decisions taken at the factory level. In
    such a worldwide and dynamic environment, the ability of automatizing the preliminary
    coordination and negotiation activities involved in setting up supply chains for
    specific needs, in an open marketplace-like fashion, could greatly improve the
    ability of factories to quickly react to external challenges and driving forces.
    6.3.2 Intra-factory Interoperability Layer Part of the COMPOSITION Architecture
    In this chapter, we will address the COMPOSITION architecture in the data analytics
    context. The intra-factory interoperability layer has two main goals: the first
    one is to provide an infrastructure to combine distributed data in the integrated
    information management system and to do data analytics, the second one is to ensure
    the conformity between communications among interconnected components. Figure
    6.8 shows the relevant part of the architecture. Figure 6.8 Intra-factory interoperability
    layer components and dependencies. The components of the architecture are introduced
    and described in the following: The BMS is provided by a project development stakeholder
    and is the translation layer providing shop floor connectivity from sensors to
    the COMPOSITION system. Raw data storage is added for oﬄine debug purposes. The
    Middleware is the main recipient in which the interoperability of single components
    act. LinkSmart is a well-known middleware solution per se and is customized to
    satisfy the requirements of the COMPOSITION project. LinkSmart comprises the following
    components: The Service Catalog works as service index and provides security information
    for service intercommunication. The Event Aggregator parses messages to ensure
    homogeneity in data streams. Keycloak is a virtual layer that ensures authorization
    and authentication. Like all security related measures, it is deployed by the
    Security Framework. The broker-based intra-factory communication system manages
    all internal communication. The Big Data Analytics component provides Complex
    Event Processing (CEP) capabilities for the data provided by the intra-factory
    integration layer The Hidden Storage is an optional storage not accessible from
    the outside in which aggregated data are stored for debug purposes, i.e. re-bootstrapping
    already trained artificial neural networks belonging to the Deep Learning Toolkit
    and to the Dynamic Reasoning Engine. The Visual Analytics component is the reporting
    interface of the Decision Support System and Simulation and Forecasting Toolkit.
    The Dynamic Reasoning Engine is part of the Simulation and Forecasting Toolkit.
    The Decision Support System uses process models to guide the production process.
    Having a fist overview of the components of the COMPOSITION project and their
    dependencies, we continue with describing our approach to smart data analysis
    in the following section. 6.3.3 The Complex-Event Machine Learning methodology
    Manufacturing in assembly lines consist of a set of hundreds, thousands or millions
    of small discrete steps aligned in a production process. Automatized production
    processes or production lines thereby produce for each of those steps small bits
    of data in form of events. Although the events possess valuable information, this
    information loses its value over time. Additionally, the data in the events usually
    are meaningless if they are not contextualized, either by other events, sensor
    data or process context. To extract most value of the data, it must be processed
    as it is produced, to be more precise in real-time and on demand. Therefore, in
    case of Big Data Analyses we propose the usage of Complex-Event Processing for
    the data management coming from the production facilities. In this manner, the
    data is processed in the moment when it is produced, extracting the maximum value,
    reducing latency, providing reactivity, giving it context and avoiding the need
    of archiving unnecessary data. The Complex-Event Processing service is provided
    by the LinkSmart® Learning Agent (LA). The LA is a Stream Mining service that
    provides the utilities to manage real-time data for several purposes. On the one
    hand, the LA provides a set of tools to collect, annotate, filter, aggregate,
    or cache the real-time data incoming from the production facilities. This set
    of tools facilitates the possibility to build applications on top of real-time
    data. On the other hand, the LA provides a set of APIs to manage the real-time
    data lifecycle for continuous learning. Moreover, the LA can process the live
    data to provide complex analysis creating real-time results for alerting or informing
    about important conditions in the factory, that may be not be seen at first glance.
    Finally, the LA allows the possibility to adapt to the productions needs during
    the production process. The Complex-Event Machine Learning (CEML) [2] is a framework
    that combines Complex-Event Processing (CEP) [3] and Machine Learning (ML) [4]
    applied to the IoT. This means that the framework was developed to be deployed
    everywhere, from the edge of the network to the cloud. Furthermore, the framework
    can manage itself and works autonomously. The following section briefly describes
    the different aspects that CEML covers. The framework must automate the learning
    process and the deployment management. This process can be broken down in different
    phases: (1) the data must be collected from different sensors, either from the
    same device or in a local network. (2) The data must be pre-processed for attribute
    extraction. (3) The learning process takes place. (4) The learning must be evaluated.
    (5) When the evaluation shows that the model is ready, the deployment must take
    place. Finally, all these phases happen continuously and repetitively, while the
    environment constantly changes. Therefore, the model and the deployment must adapt
    as well. 6.3.3.1 Learning agents architecture We utilize LinkSmart® LA following
    a modular architecture with loosely coupled modules responsible for different
    tasks. Figure 6.9 illustrates the architecture of the LA. The data and commands
    come via communication protocols implemented by Connectors (Figure 6.9 shows two
    example implementations, REST and MQTT). The connectors transfer the information
    to the Feeders, which process the data accordingly to the API logic. This logic
    depends on whether it is an insertion of new raw data, request of simple data
    processing (statement) or a machine learning request (CEML request). The data
    is inserted into the execution environment (in this case EsperEngine [1]), while
    the data processing requests are deployed in the same engine for the processing
    of the raw data. The CEML request has a more complex behaviour. Each CEML request
    is managed by its own CEMLManager, which contains and coordinates the model(s),
    evaluator for each model, and several statements. Finally, all output of any process
    (Statement) in the execution pipeline (EsperEngine) is captured or managed by
    a Handler. If the process should be prepared and sent through a communication
    protocol, then it will be handled by a Complex-Event Handler: An Asynchronous
    Handler, if the protocol is asynchronous (e.g. MQTT); or Synchronous Handler,
    if the protocol is synchronous (e.g. HTTP). [1] Esper is an open-source Java-based
    software product for Complex event processing (CEP) and Event stream processing
    (ESP) that analyzes series of events for deriving conclusions from them. See http://www.espertech.com/
    Figure 6.9 LinkSmart® Learning Service Architecture sketch. 6.3.3.2 Data propagation
    phase Data in the IoT is produced in several places, protocols, formats, and devices.
    Although this article does not address the problem of data heterogeneity in detail,
    the learning agents require a mechanism to acquire and manage the heterogeneity
    of the data. The mechanism must be scalable and, at the same time, the protocol
    should handle the asynchronous nature of IoT. Finally, the protocol must provide
    tools to handle the pub/sub characteristics of the CEP engines. Therefore, we
    have chosen MQTT [2], a well-established Client Server publish/subscribe messaging
    transport protocol. The topic based message protocol provides a mechanism to manage
    the data heterogeneity by making a relation between topics and payloads. It allows
    deployments in several architectures, OS, and hardware platforms; basic constraints
    at the edge of the network. The protocol is payload agnostic and as such allows
    for maximum flexibility to support several types of payloads. [2] MQTT is a machine-to-machine
    (M2M)/“Internet of Things” connectivity protocol. Source http://mqtt.org/ 6.3.3.3
    Data pre-processing (munging) phase Usually ML is tied to stored datasets, which
    incurs several drawbacks. Firstly, the learning can take place only with persistent
    data. Secondly, usually the models generated are based on historical data, not
    current data. Both constrains, in the IoT, have direct consequences. It is neither
    feasible nor profitable to store all data. In addition, embedded devices do not
    have much storage capacity, which makes it impossible to use ML algorithms on
    them. Furthermore, IoT deployments are commonly exposed to ever-changing environments.
    Using historical data for off-line learning could cause outdated models to learn
    old patterns rather than current ones, producing drifted models. Although some
    IoT platforms like COMPOSITION support storage of historical data, it may be too
    time and space consuming to create large enough times series. Therefore, there
    is also a need for non-persistence manipulation tools. This is precisely what
    the CEP engine provides in the CEML framework. This means, the CEP engine decides
    which data and how the data is manipulated using predefined CEP statements deployed
    in the engine. Each statement can be seen as a topic, to which each learning model
    is subscribed. Any update of the subscribers provides a sample to be learnt in
    the learning phase. 6.3.3.4 Learning phase There is no pre-selection of algorithms
    in the framework. They are selected by the restrictions imposed by the problem
    domain. For example, in extreme constrained devices, algorithms such as Algorithm
    Output Granularity (AOG) [5] may be the right choice. In other cases where the
    model changes quickly, one-shot algorithms may be the best fit. Artificial Neural
    Networks are good for complex problems but only with stable phenomena. This means
    that the algorithm selection should be made case-by-case. Our framework provides
    mechanisms for the management and deployment of the learning models, and the process
    of how the model is fed with samples. In general, the process is based on incremental
    learning [6] albeit with online and non-persistent data. The process can be summarized
    as follows: the samples, without the target provided in the last phase, are used
    to generate a prediction. The prediction will then be sent to the next phase.
    Thereafter, the sample is applied to update the model. Thus, all updates are used
    for the learning process. 6.3.3.5 Continuous validation phase This section describes
    how the validation of the learning models is done inside the CEML. This phase
    does not influence the learning process nor validate the CEML framework itself.
    ML model validation is a challenging topic in real-time environments and the evaluation
    for distributed environments or embedded devices is not addressed extensively
    in the literature, which is why we think it needs further research. There are
    two addressed strategies. Either we holdout an evaluation dataset by taking a
    control subset for given time-frame (time window), or we use Predictive Sequential,
    also known as Prequential [7], in which we assess each sequential prediction against
    the observation. The following section describes the continuous validation we
    applied for a classification problem, even though it can be applied for other
    cases as well. Instead of accumulating a sample for validation, we analyse the
    predictions made before the learning takes place. All predictions are assessed
    each time an update arrives. The assessment is an entry for the confusion matrix
    [8], which is accumulated in an accumulated confusion matrix. The matrix contains
    the accumulation of all assessed predictions done before. In other words, the
    matrix does not describe the current validation state of the model, but instead
    the trajectory of it. Using this matrix, the accumulated validation metrics (e.g.
    Accuracy, Precision, Sensitivity, etc.) are being calculated. This methodology
    does have some drawbacks and advantages, explained more extensively in [9]. 6.3.3.6
    Deployment phase The continuous validation opens the possibility for making an
    assessment of the status of the model each time a new update arrives, e.g. if
    it is accrued or not. Using this information, the CEML framework has the capability
    to decide if the model should or should not be deployed into the system at any
    time. If the model is behaving well, then it should be deployed, otherwise it
    should be removed from the deployment. The decision is made by user-provided thresholds
    w.r.t. evaluation metrics. If a threshold is reached, the CEML inserts the model
    into the CEP engine and starts processing the streams using the model. Otherwise,
    if the model do not reach the threshold, it is removed from the CEP engine. 6.3.3.7
    Assessment In [6] 13 issues for learning in the IoT where left open. The CEML
    framework addresses 10 out of the 13 challenges as follows: Handling the continuous
    flow of data streams: This is done by the stream statements inside the CEP engine
    using continuous streams for learning an evaluating. Unbounded memory requirements:
    The use of CEP engines in stream windows allows the intelligent usage of the memory
    as is needed, dropping it otherwise. Transferring data mining results over a wireless
    network with limited bandwidth: This is partially handled. MQTT is a reliable
    low-bandwidth lightweight protocol developed for satellite monitoring of pipelines.
    Nevertheless, this paper does not address the physical layer. Modelling changes
    of mining results over time: The CEML is a continuous automatic learning mechanism.
    The learning models will adjust as they learn. Interactive mining environment
    to satisfy user requirements: The IoT Learning agent provide an REST API. Thus,
    update the learning request is possible, as well as, obtaining live or on-demand
    updates. Integration between data-stream management systems and ubiquitous data-stream
    mining approaches: The CEML provides a REST API for managing each kind of request
    independently. Thus, the learning request can be managed as a whole, including
    the involved streams. Besides, the streams can be managed individually as single
    stream statement. Additionally, the MQTT API provides a multi-cast API so that
    in distributed multi-agent deployment, the agents can be managed as one, as groups,
    or as one entity. The relationship between the proposed techniques and the needs
    of real-world applications: Legal, ethical and technical reasons are part of the
    motivation. E.g. the storage constrains or the legal constraints in the health
    domain. Data pre-processing in the stream-mining process: This is handled in the
    pre-processing phase of the CEML. The technological issue of mining data streams:
    The implementation presented here shows that the system behaves in a real-time
    environment. The formalization of real-time accuracy evaluation: This is addressed
    by the Double-Tumble-Window Evaluation. In addition to the Complex-Event Machine
    Learning approach based on the open-source IoT platform LinkSmart, we also describe
    another approach carried out in the scope of the project COMPOSITION in the next
    section. 6.3.4 Unsupervised Anomaly Detection in Production Lines In addition
    to the previously introduced framework, which primarily allows for an exploitation
    of supervised machine learning algorithms, this chapter focuses on an alternative
    unsupervised approach that was also implemented in the scope of the project COMPOSITION.
    This method was used as a further extension to optimize the detection of machine
    errors in production lines at early stages. In the last couple of years, the importance
    of cyber-physical systems in order to optimize industry processes, has led to
    a significant increase of sensorized production environments. Data collected in
    this context allows for new intelligent solutions to e.g. support decision processes
    or to enable predictive maintenance. One problem related to the latter case is
    the detection of anomalies in the behaviour of machines without any kind of predefined
    ground truth. This fact is further complicated, if a reconfiguration of machine
    parameters is done on-the-fly, due to varying requirements of multiple items processed
    by the same production line. As a consequence, a change of adjustable parameters
    in most cases directly leads to divergent measurements, even though those observations
    should not be regarded as anomalies. In the scope of the project COMPOSITION,
    the task of detecting anomalies for predictive maintenance within historical sensor
    data from a real reflow oven was investigated. While the oven is used for soldering
    surface mount electronic components to printed circuit boards based on continuously
    changing recipes, one related problem was the unsupervised recognition of potential
    misbehaviours of the oven resulting from erroneous components. The utilized data
    set comprises information about the heat and power consumption of individual fans.
    Apart from additional machine parameters like a predefined heat value for each
    section of the oven, it contains time-annotated sensor observations and process
    information recorded over a period of more than seven years. As one solution for
    this problem, we will present our approach named Generic Anomaly Detection for
    Production Lines, short GADPL. The hereafter-presented description of GADPL is
    based on the stage-wise implementation of the algorithm. After an initial clustering
    of similar input parameters and a consecutive segmentation, we will discuss the
    representation of individual segments and the corresponding measurement of dissimilarity.
    6.3.4.1 Configuration clustering In many companies, as well as in the case of
    the project COMPOSITION, a single production line is often used to produce multiple
    items according to different requirements. Those requirements are in general defined
    by varying machine configurations consisting of one or more adjustable parameters,
    which are changed ‘on-the-fly’ during runtime. For a detection of deviations with
    respect to some default behaviour of a machine, this fact raises the problem of
    invalid comparisons between sensor measurements of dissimilar configurations.
    If a measurement or an interval of measurements is identified as an anomaly, it
    should only be considered as such, if this observation is related to the same
    configuration as observations representing the default behaviour. Therefore in
    advance to all subsequent steps, at first all sensor measurements have to be clustered
    according to their associated configuration. For the sake of simplicity, we are
    only discussing the process within a single cluster in the following subsections,
    although one has to keep in mind that each step is done in parallel for all clusters.
    6.3.4.2 Segmentation As a result of the configuration-based clustering, the data
    is already segmented coarsely. However, since this approach describes unsupervised
    anomaly detection, the idea of a further segmentation is to create some kind of
    ground truth, which reflects the default behaviour of a machine. In this section,
    we will see how the segmentation is utilized to implement this idea. In an initial
    step, a maximum segmentation length is defined, in order to specify the time horizon,
    after which an anomaly can be detected. Assuming a sampling rate of 5 mins per
    sensor, the maximum length of a segment would consequently be (60 × 24)/5 = 288
    to describe the behaviour on a daily basis. Although a decrease of the segment
    length implies a decrease of response time, it also increases the computational
    complexity and makes the detection more sensitive to invalid sensor measurements.
    In this context, it needs to be mentioned that in this stage segments are also
    spitted, if they are not continuous with respect to time as a result of missing
    values. Another fact that has to be considered is the transition time of configuration
    changes. While the input parameters associated with a configuration change directly,
    the observations might adapt more slowly and therefore blur the expressiveness
    of the new segment. To prevent this from happening, the transition part of all
    segments, which have been created due to configuration changes, is truncated.
    If segments become smaller than a predefined threshold, they can be ignored in
    the upcoming phases. 6.3.4.3 Feature extraction Having a set of segments for each
    configuration, the next step is to determine the characteristics of all segments.
    While the literature presents multiple approaches to describe the behaviour of
    time series, we will focus on common statistical features extracted from each
    segment. Nonetheless, the choice of features is not fixed, which is why any feature
    suitable for the individual application scenario can be used. One example for
    rather complex features could be the result of a kernel fitting in the context
    of Gaussian processes, accepting a decrease in performance. Since the goal is
    to capture comparable characteristics of a segment, we compute different real-valued
    features and combine them in a vectorised representation. In the case of the project
    COMPOSITION, we used the mean to describe the average level, the variance as a
    measure of fluctuation and the lower and upper quartiles as a coarse distribution-binning
    of values. Due to the expressiveness of features being dependent from the actual
    data, one possible way to optimize the selection of features is the Principal
    Component Analysis. Simply using a large number of features to best possibly cover
    the variety of characteristics might have a negative influence on the measurement
    of dissimilarity. The reason for this is the partial consideration of irrelevant
    features within distance computations. Moreover, since thresholds could be regarded
    as a more intuitive solution compared to additionally extracted features, this
    replacement would lead to a significant decrease in the number of recognized anomalies.
    Apart from the sensitivity to outliers, the reason is a neglect of the inherent
    behaviour of a time series. As an example, consider the measurements of an acoustic
    sensor attached to a motor that recently is sending fluctuating measurements,
    yet within the predefined tolerance. Although the recorded values are still considered
    as valid, the fluctuation with respect to the volume could already indicate a
    nearly defect motor. Finally, one initially needs to evaluate appropriate thresholds
    for any parameter of each configuration. 6.3.4.4 Dissimilarity measurement So
    far, we have discussed the exploitation of inherent information, extracted from
    segmented time series. The final step of GADPL is to measure the level of dissimilarity
    for all obtained representatives. Since no ground truth is available to define
    the default behaviour for a specific configuration, the algorithm uses an approximation
    based on the given data. One problem in this regard is the variability of a default
    behaviour, consisting of more than one pattern. Therefore, a naive approach as
    choosing the most occurring representative, would already fail for a time series
    consisting of two equally appearing patterns captured by different segments, where
    consequently half of the data would be detected as anomalous behaviour. As one
    potential solution GADPL instead uses the mean over a specified size of nearest
    neighbours, depicting the most similar behaviour according to each segment. The
    idea is that even though there might multiple distinct characteristics in the
    data, at least a predefined number of elements represent the same behaviour compared
    to the processed item. Otherwise, this item will even have a high average dissimilarity
    with respect to the most similar observations and can therefore be classified
    as anomaly. Here, for the vectorised feature representations, any suitable distance
    function is applicable. In the context of the project COMPOSITION we decided to
    use the Euclidean distance for a uniform distribution of weights, applied to normalized
    feature values. To further increase the performance of nearest neighbour queries,
    we exploited the R*-tree as a high-dimensional index structure. Given the dissimilarity
    for each individual representative together with a predefined anomaly threshold,
    GADPL finally emits potential candidates having an anomalous behaviour. Figure
    6.10 Example application of GADPL. The application of GADPL is illustrated in
    Figure 6.10. The upper part shows the segmentation of time annotated power consumption
    data in percent. The lower part illustrates the result of the dissimilarity measurement,
    where the red rectangle indicates classified anomalies. 6.3.5 Summary In this
    section, we have presented our recent research activities within the scope of
    the EU project COMPOSITION. As an example for the manufacturing industry, we have
    briefly described the COMPOSITION architecture along with one of its main components:
    the open-source IoT platform Link-Smart. As part of our ongoing work, we have
    also described our corresponding research activities regarding the analysis of
    sensor data from manufacturing industry. 6.4 Summary and Conclusions In this work,
    we have given insights into our recent research activities with regard to the
    domains of Smart Data and Industrial Internet of Things. To this end, we have
    focused on the EU projects MONSOON and COMPOSITION as examples for the Public-Private
    Partnership (PPP) initiatives Factories of the Future (FoF) and Sustainable Process
    Industry (SPIRE). We have shown two different but conceptually similar architectures
    for scalable and agile data analytics. In addition, we have provided an overview
    of our recent Smart Data activities and have exemplified ongoing data-driven analysis
    of industrial production processes from the process and manufacturing industries.
    We conclude that data-driven investigations, either applied in process industry
    or manufacturing industry, require a solid platform for handling data analytics
    at scale. The proposed architecture of the Cross Sectorial Data Lab in combination
    with the open-source IoT platform LinkSmart seem to be promising developments,
    which are applicable to any industrial sector. Acknowledgements The projects underlying

    The chapter presents an overview of the eight that are part of the European IoT
    Security and Privacy Projects initiative (IoT-ESP) addressing advanced concepts
    for end-to-end security in highly distributed, heterogeneous and dynamic IoT environments.
    The approaches presented are holistic and include identification and authentication,
    data protection and prevention against cyber-attacks at the device and system
    levels. The projects present architectures, concepts, methods and tools for open
    IoT platforms integrating evolving sensing, actuating, energy harvesting, networking
    and interface technologies. Platforms should provide connectivity and intelligence,
    actuation and control features, linkage to modular and ad-hoc cloud services,
    The IoT platforms used are compatible with existing international developments
    addressing object identity management, discovery services, virtualisation of objects,
    devices and infrastructures and trusted IoT approaches. 7.1 BRAIN-IoT 7.1.1 BRAIN-IoT
    Project Vision In line with the optimistic forecasts released in last years, Internet
    of Things (IoT) products and services are being more and more deployed in mass-market
    and professional usage scenarios, becoming a reality in our day-by-day life. Commercial
    and pilot deployments world-wide are progressively demonstrating the value of
    IoT solutions in real conditions, but also rising some concerns with respect to
    dependability, security, privacy and safety constraints. The IoT technology and
    market landscape will become increasingly complex in the longer term i.e. 10+
    years from now, especially after IoT technologies will have proven their full
    potential in business-critical and privacy-sensitive scenarios. An important shift
    is expected to happen as technology evolutions will allow to safely employ IoT
    systems in scenarios involving actuation and characterized by stricter requirements
    in terms of dependability, security, privacy and safety constraints, resulting
    in convergence between IoT and Cyber Physical Systems (CPS). Attracted by the
    trend, several organizations have started studying how to employ IoT systems also
    to support tasks involving actuation and control in business-critical conditions,
    resulting in a demand for more dependable and “smart” IoT systems. However, in
    order to turn such vision in reality, many issues must still be faced, including:
    Heterogeneity and (lack of) interoperability: a wide number of IoT platforms exist
    on the market, both cloud-based and locally hosted. Standardization and open-source
    initiatives are facilitating convergence among available platforms, which now
    employ similar usage patterns and increasingly converging sets of protocols, APIs,
    device models and data interchange formats. Nevertheless, full interoperability
    across platform still needs to be tackled on a case by case, platform by platform
    basis, due the wide amount of possible applications, design choices, customization
    options, formats and configurations that can be adopted by IoT developers and
    adopters. Difficulty of implementing “Smart Behaviours” in open collaboration
    context: while Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques
    are rapidly evolving to provide smart behaviours and solutions to increasingly
    complex problems, it is intrinsically difficult to generically “bind” such solutions
    to generic concrete IoT and CPS platforms and to make them collaborate for common
    tasks, since possible interactions between platforms remain unforeseen a priori.
    Security and safety: the distributed nature of IoT makes enforcement of good security
    practices intrinsically challenging. The market asks for IoT solutions suitable
    to safely support business-critical tasks, which can be deployed rapidly and with
    low costs. The emerging availability of actuation features in IoT systems calls
    for stricter security requirements. Nevertheless, many of today’s IoT-based products
    are implemented with low awareness of potential security risks. As a result, many
    IoT products lack even basic, state-of-the-art security mechanisms, resulting
    in critical effects when such flaws deployed to mass-market scenarios. Enforcement
    of Privacy and Data Ownership policies: as IoT products are increasingly purchased
    and deployed by corporate and private users in their homes, work places, factories
    and commercial areas, privacy issues and violations become more frequent. While
    policies are quickly catching up by enforcing a suitable framework of rules within
    the EU, a comprehensive solution able to give back control of privacy aspects
    to users is still missing – creating significant issues when unaware users accept
    that their data is moved in foreign countries, outside the safe shield provided
    by EU regulations. Business models colliding with long-term resilience and survivability
    of IoT services: many IoT solutions on the market adopt fully centralized, cloud-oriented
    approaches. This is often done e.g. to ensure that customers’ devices are forced
    to use forever a single commercial back-end service. Such lock-in approaches create
    artificial monopolies, negatively affecting user rights and the overall market
    competitiveness. This practice introduces singular point of failures in IoT systems,
    making survivability and resiliency features difficult to be granted in the long
    term, therefore sometimes resulting in negative experiences for end users. Market
    Fragmentation and incumbency of large players: the current market of IoT platform
    solution is still affected by fragmentation among the many IoT platforms available
    each focused in specific application domain or associated technology stacks. Moreover,
    some market segments (i.e. the cloud-based IoT platforms market) are notably dominated
    by few dominant players – often based outside the EU, thus hampering the potential
    business opportunities for EU companies. While EU-based initiatives and policies
    are doing significant amount of work to tackle such issues, often with very positive
    results, solutions suitable to tackle challenges arising for futuristic IoT usage
    scenarios are still missing. Future critical issues may be hiding under the hood
    already now and be ready to appear in the close future, putting at stake user
    acceptance and the credibility of the whole eco-system of IoT solutions vendors,
    integrators and adopters and hindering wider adoption of IoT solutions in potentially
    valuable markets. 7.1.2 Objectives In order to tackle the aforementioned challenges,
    the BRAIN-IoT (model-Based fRamework for dependable sensing and Actuation in INtelligent
    decentralized IoT systems) project focuses on complex scenarios, where actuation
    and control are cooperatively supported by populations of heterogeneous IoT systems.
    In such a complex context, many initiatives fall into the temptation of developing
    new IoT platforms, protocols, models or tools aiming to deliver the ultimate solution
    that will solve all the IoT challenges and become “the” reference IoT platform
    or standard. Instead, usually they result in the creation of “yet-another” IoT
    solution or standard. BRAIN-IoT will establish the principle that future IoT applications
    should never be supported by a single, unique, irreplaceable IoT platform. Rather
    future IoT services should exist within a federated/evolving environment that
    not only leverages current Industry Standards but is also capable of adapting
    to embrace future unforeseen industry developments. BRAIN-IoT aims at demonstrating
    that the lack of a single IoT standard and platform, which is generally recognized
    as the most notable weakness of IoT, can be turned into a strength and a guarantee
    for market competitiveness and user protection – if the proper framework for IoT
    dynamicity, security and privacy is in place. The breakthrough targeted by BRAIN-IoT
    is to establish a practical framework and methodology suitable to enable smart
    cooperative behaviour in fully de-centralized, composable and dynamic federations
    of heterogeneous IoT platforms. BRAIN-IoT builds on model-based approaches and
    open industry standards and aims at supporting rapid development and deployment
    of applications and services in professional usage scenarios characterized by
    strict constraints in terms of dependability, safety, security and privacy. The
    BRAIN-IoT vision is realized through seven Technical Objectives (TOs), as described
    in Table 7.1. Table 7.1 BRAIN-IoT technical objectives Technical Objective (TO)
    Description TO1: to enforce interoperability across heterogeneous IoT devices
    autonomously cooperating in complex tasks. BRAIN-IoT approach to interoperability
    is based on the adoption of shared semantic models, dynamically linked to concrete
    IoT devices (sensors, actuators, controls, etc.) operating autonomously in complex
    scenarios. Binding of models to concrete implementations leverages mapping to
    open industry standards for semantic device description. TO2: to enable dynamic
    smart autonomous behaviour involving actuation in IoT scenarios Building upon
    shared models (TO1) BRAIN-IoT facilitates the deployment of smart cooperative
    behaviour, realized by means of modular AI/ML features which can be dynamically
    deployed to heterogeneous IoT devices in mixed edge/cloud IoT environments. Smart
    behaviour features are enriched by distributed data processing, federated learning,
    virtualization/aggregation of data/events/objects, resolution of mixed-criticality
    situations and conflicts, verification and context-aware self-adaptation of connectivity
    and real-time event-oriented, reactive approaches. TO3: to enable the emergence
    of highly dynamic federations of heterogeneous IoT platforms able to support secure
    and scalable operations for future IoT use cases This is achieved by leveraging
    fully de-centralized peer-to-peer approaches providing linkage between modular,
    ad-hoc IoT self-hosted and cloud-based services through existing open standards.
    TO4: to establish Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (AAA) in dynamic,
    distributed IoT scenarios BRAIN-IoT introduces a holistic end-to-end trust framework
    for IoT platforms suitable to be employed in scenarios characterized by strict
    security and safety requirements, associated with actuation and semi-autonomous
    operations, and by special needs for secure identification, authentication of
    data and devices, encryption, non-deniability, as well as detection of cyber-attacks
    and protection against them. This is done by adopting established security protocols,
    joint with distributed security approaches derived by peer-to-peer systems e.g.
    block-chain. TO5: to provide solutions to embed privacy-awareness and privacy
    control features in IoT solutions BRAIN-IoT develops new patterns for interaction
    between users and IoT solutions, leveraging semantic mapping of privacy requirements
    towards data and service models in use in each specific use case, introducing
    privacy-related APIs and models. This enables the possibility to programmatically
    inform users about privacy policies in place, as well as enabling them to exercise
    fine-grained privacy controls. TO6: to facilitate rapid model-based development
    and integration of interoperable IoT solutions supporting smart cooperative behaviour
    BRAIN-IoT provides tools to ease rapid prototyping (development, integration)
    of smart cooperative IoT systems. This is achieved by extending available tools
    for development, integration, commissioning and management of IoT and Cyber-Physical
    systems. TO7: to enable commissioning and reconfiguration of decentralized IoT-based
    applications BRAIN-IoT enables end-users to dynamically commission and reconfigure
    their modular IoT instances, choosing among the available platforms, modules implementations
    and services. This is achieved by extending existing open marketplace of IoT services
    and data jointly with available catalogues providing open IoT enablers and integrating
    them with its federation framework. Figure 7.1 The high-level BRAIN-IoT concept.
    7.1.3 Technical Approach The overall BRAIN-IoT concept is depicted in Figure 7.1
    following the reference model proposed by Recommendation ITU-T Y.2060. BRAIN-IoT
    looks at heterogeneous IoT scenarios where instances of IoT architectures can
    be built dynamically combining and federating a distributed set of IoT services,
    IoT platforms and other enabling functionalities made available in marketplaces
    and accessible by means of open and standard IoT APIs and protocols. At the bottom
    of the conceptual architecture, the IoT Devices and Gateways layer represents
    all physical world IoT devices with sensing or actuating capabilities, computing
    devices and includes complex subsystems such as autonomous robots and critical
    control devices. It is worth observing that BRAIN-IoT specifically aims to support
    the integration into an IoT environment of devices and subsystems with actuation
    features that could possible give rise to mixed-criticality situations and require
    the implementation of distributed processing approaches. The BRAIN-IoT Management
    capabilities includes all the features needed to support the envisioned fully
    decentralized scenario dynamically integrating heterogeneous IoT Devices and Gateways
    as well as: IoT Services – third party services accessible through open interfaces
    and offering data or various functionalities including data storage, data statistics
    and analytics, data visualization; IoT Platforms – instances of open IoT platforms
    whose configuration and functionalities can be dynamically updated; IoT Modules
    – enabling functionalities (e.g., smart control features, data processing, data
    storage) that can be associated to a specific IoT platform instance and composed
    in order to meet given functional requirements. Concerning the IoT Modules, the
    ones supporting smart control features are particularly relevant for the BRAIN-IoT
    challenging scenarios encompassing heterogeneous sensors and actuators autonomously
    cooperating in complex, dynamic tasks, possibly across different IoT Platforms.
    BRAIN-IoT will then develop a library of IoT modules implementing algorithms promoting
    collaborative context-based behaviours, control solutions based on Machine Learning
    Control, real-time data analysis and knowledge extraction techniques. Concerning
    the IoT Platforms, BRAIN-IoT will support different existing IoT solutions including
    e.g., FIWARE and SOFIA. All the above IoT building blocks can be described by
    a set of open and extendable vocabularies as well as semantic and behavioural
    models. This actually allows moving forward an easier, automated and dynamic integration
    within the BRAIN-IoT environment of new and existing IoT Services, Platforms and
    Modules available for traditional IoT applications. In fact, BRAIN-IoT defines
    a new meta-language, namely the IoT Modelling Language (IoT-ML), which uses the
    above set of vocabularies and models to formally describe an IoT Instance i.e.,
    how a given set of IoT services and Platforms are interconnected with each other
    and federated and which IoT Modules are associated to the considered IoT Platforms.
    IoT-ML will base on existing solutions provided by OMG and W3C. The Decentralized
    IoT Instances management is instead in charge of offering the capabilities needed
    to support the dynamic composition of a given set of IoT building blocks into
    a specific IoT Instance. The vision is to progress from the fog computing paradigm
    and create distributed IoT Micro-cloud environments hosting IoT Platforms and
    IoT Modules and advertising their runtime capabilities. The resulting Micro-cloud
    environments are enhanced with management capabilities that allow search and discovery
    operations and their dynamic federation to form a specific IoT instance. These
    capabilities pave the way toward highly dynamic scenarios where IoT Modules and
    relevant functionalities can be composed and migrated runtime from one IoT Platform
    to another, complex tasks can be dynamically distributed between the edge and
    the cloud IoT Platforms depending on variable requirements and where IoT Instances
    can be fully reconfigured adding/removing runtime new IoT building blocks from
    the federation. BRAIN-IoT will also provide peculiar management strategies and
    techniques permitting the dynamic deployment/transfer of Smart Control IoT Modules
    across mixed edge and cloud environments. The Decentralized IoT Instances management
    also handles advanced IoT Instances configurations, properly orchestrating external
    IoT services with other IoT building blocks active in the resulting BRAIN-IoT
    fog environment. Finally, monitoring components allow to continuously supervise
    the overall IoT Instance and relevant composite application. In this way, it is
    possible to check the status of the federated building blocks, provide alerting,
    reporting and logging mechanisms and, if needed, trigger an IoT Instance reconfiguration
    e.g., because of a failure in one of the adopted IoT Modules, Platforms or Services.
    All the described management capabilities will base on relevant industry standards
    i.e., W3C Web of Things and OSGi, and will be extended to support agile composition
    and orchestration. The scalability aspects will be taken into careful consideration
    to support effective discovery and search of a potential high number of IoT building
    blocks. The orchestration process is conceived in such a way that it is possible
    to import/link IoT Modules, Platforms and Services made available from a BRAIN-IoT
    Marketplace characterized by a relevant set of open APIs. One of the most peculiar
    aspects being considered in BRAIN-IoT is the management of actuation capabilities
    in the considered Fog environment. In this context, the possibility to easily
    develop the previously introduced smart control features is pretty relevant. To
    this aim, BRAIN-IoT will evolve from already existing solutions, such as Eclipse
    Papyrus, and develop Model Binding and Synthesis tools extended to support the
    BRAIN-IoT open vocabularies and models, the IoT-ML and other IoT related standards.
    The resulting toolset will be used to develop novel Smart Control Features that
    could be possibly published as IoT Modules in the BRAIN-IoT Marketplace, as depicted
    in Figure 7.2. Figure 7.2 BRAIN-IoT development concept. Finally, Figure 7.3.
    summarizes the above description of the BRAIN-IoT environment offering a view
    of possible configurations of an IoT Instance with different distribution of the
    IoT building blocks between edge and cloud. Figure 7.3 BRAIN-IoT deployment concept.
    7.1.4 Security Architecture Concept From the security and privacy perspective,
    IoT currently presents two main inherent weaknesses: Security is not considered
    at the design phase, As of today, no solution is offering a complete end-to-end
    security approach for any kind of devices (from the temperature sensor, the smoke
    detector, to the robot). Existing systems don’t apply the “secure-by-design” concept
    where security is seen as one of the major constraint of the system. To provide
    secure IoT solutions, modelling and analysis need to be integrated in the design
    and validation of application scenarios and IoT architectures. If the focus moves
    to a scenario where different heterogeneous building blocks are dynamically composed,
    additional security and privacy concerns arise. As a consequence, BRAIN-IoT provides
    a methodology to address security in the considered fog environment, based on
    an iterative process, allowing to take into account new scenarios. More specifically,
    BRAIN-IoT extend the successful methods of attack tree modelling and quantitative
    analysis to support secure composable IoT systems. This extension enables transparent
    risk assessment of IoT security architectures, i.e., it will address the needs
    and potential risks involved in an IoT environment specifying when and where to
    apply security controls in an understandable way thus raising user-awareness and
    trustworthiness. The results of the analysis are specific technical requirement
    to implement for each use case/scenario in order to reach the targeted security
    level. Figure 7.4 Iterative risk analysis methodology. Second, existing security
    solution for IoT have many weaknesses, such as: Lot of flow disruption (with network
    component accessing data in clear text) Some protocol chooses to downgrade security
    algorithm to fit performance constraints, State-of-the-art solution are complex
    to set up in decentralized environment. In order to provide a new approach, BRAIN-IoT
    integrates innovative Decentralized Security and Privacy Capabilities including
    Authentication, Authorization and Accounting for the overall distributed fog environment
    and end-to-end security for IoT data-flows. This security layer is based on a
    combination of well-established standards, such as PKI, with more innovative solution,
    stateless oriented, to fit the constraints of any kind of IoT (low power, low
    bandwidth, etc.) Figure 7.5 Decentralised security and privacy capabilities. A
    cross-platforms framework facilitating the adoption of privacy control policies
    is also hosted in the BRAIN-IoT environment. The objective is to provide end users
    with the means to easily monitor and control which data to – collect and to who
    make it available. 7.1.5 Use Cases and Domain Specific Issues The overall depicted
    concept draws requirements and challenging use cases from IoT applications in
    two usage scenarios, namely Service Robotics and Critical Infrastructure Management,
    which provide the suitable setting to reflect future challenges in terms of dependability,
    need for smart behaviour, security and privacy/data ownership management which
    are expected to become more significant and impacting in the long-term (10+years).
    7.1.5.1 Service robotics The Service Robotics use case will involve several robotic
    platforms, like the open-source Robotics Operating System (ROS), which need to
    collaborate to scan a given warehouse and to assist humans in a logistics domain.
    The term Service Robotics is generally related to the use of robots to support
    operations done by humans and the logistics domain is one of the more interesting,
    for the presence of several tasks, where the robots can help the workers, making
    their tasks easier and safer. As example, they can cooperate to move a heavy object
    from one place to another. At the same time, robots involved in the scenario should
    scan the whole warehouse and update in real-time informative interfaces for the
    managers and the workers (e.g. warehouse’s map), sharing the collected information.
    In addition, to the information related to the maps of the whole monitored area,
    the connected robots will also be equipped with a set of sensors, which will allow
    collecting interesting info, like room temperature, presence of humans or presence
    of obstacles in the robot path. Since several robots collaborate to collect the
    information, they can keep the status of the area updated in real-time and balance
    the effort required among them. At the beginning, the robots are configured with
    some default information, like the map of the warehouse. Then, this information
    is updated in real-time, while the robots perform their main tasks. The demonstration
    use-case proposed will include both real-time collection of data and control of
    the included robots. Particularly, the actuation of these robots will be an interesting
    test-bed for the platform, to demonstrate how the solutions developed by BRAIN-IoT
    allow to control remotely, in a standard way, the complex devices involved in
    this scenario. The BRAIN-IoT solution enables the service robotics scenario, demonstrating
    how the tool-chain and marketplace developed by the project can be used to enable
    the cooperation of the different robots. In the envisioned scenario, the BRAIN-IoT
    toolkit will be leveraged to design and test all the aspects of the use case:
    the behaviours of the robots, the interactions with humans and the cooperation
    of involved robots, to do specific tasks. The use of the BRAIN-IoT toolkit will
    enable to limit the development of new ad-hoc software components, indeed, where
    possible, the solution will be based on open-source components and services already
    developed in other IoT platforms, provided to the developers through the BRAIN-IoT’s
    marketplace and interconnected using the services and tools developed in the project.
    This scenario described will involve also several security aspects. Mechanisms
    of encryption and authentication will be adopted in the whole final solution,
    to guarantee the protection of the data exchanged and of the users’ privacy. To
    avoid inappropriate use of the robots by malicious users and to avoid possible
    incidents due to remote control (i.e. authorized workers that try to control the
    robots remotely, without a correct visual of what is happening in the warehouse),
    techniques of indoor localization are considered to guarantee that only workers
    located in specific zones near the robots can control them. Furthermore, the solution
    will protect the privacy of users, anonymizing the data collected, to avoid sharing
    users’ info, also if the data are stolen by malicious users. 7.1.5.2 Critical
    infrastructure management The Critical Water Infrastructure Monitoring and Control
    use case focuses on the management of the water urban cycle in metropolitan environment
    of Coruña. The base of this system will be made of a complex portfolio of probes,
    meters, sensors, devices and open-data sources deployed on the field, including:
    water, flow and pressure meters on the water mains; smart devices, which measure
    the main chemical-physical characteristics of water; pluviometers, which can monitor
    the level of rainwater in a specific zone, water circular pumps, which can be
    used to control the flow of liquids in heating systems. These devices will be
    geographically distributed, heterogeneous and will be provided by different owners:
    directly by the water utility, by end-users themselves or by third-party service
    providers, like, SMEs providing ancillary water services. For this reason, there
    will be many different data involved in these scenarios: meteorological open data,
    reservoir water level data, purification data, distribution data in the various
    subsystems, customer data in urban water supply processes, sewage collection and
    sewage treatment data in different subsystems. The collection of all these data
    will allow to provide value-added services, like showing to the client, commercial
    or not, the quality of the water provided to them or the possibility to react
    quickly to critical situation and to do predictive maintenance, through the ability
    to detect anomalous behaviours and to fix them, before they become an issue difficult
    to be fixed. The BRAIN-IoT solution will enable this scenario, allowing to collect
    data from all the different domains and to actuate the devices where needed. The
    WoT-based approach used for the design of the platform, will be leveraged to collect
    the data, provided by different public and private IoT platforms, using heterogeneous
    protocols and data formats. Furthermore, BRAIN-IoT focuses particularly to design
    and develop ways to control devices abstracted by these solutions. For example,
    the system needs to allow the managers to control the circulator pumps, regulating
    the fluid flow in heating system, to avoid problems or to react to some critical
    situation detected through the monitoring sensors. The collection of the data
    about water consumption from different sources generates risks about privacy protection.
    Indeed, the data can be shared with public entities or third-party services providers
    for several purposes, like statistical measures. To do this, the data need to
    be associated with all the potentially interesting contextual information (i.e.
    Position of the data, timeslot when the data have been measured and so on) but
    removing the association with all the personal info of the entity, related with
    that data. Finally, security mechanisms will be used for the actuation of devices
    that is potentially a dangerous task, which must be executed only by expert personal
    that need to know well what they are doing and the context in which the device
    is operating. For this reason, mechanisms of accounting, authentication and authorization
    will be used to guarantee that only authorized expert users are able to do these
    tricky operations. 7.2 Cognitive Heterogeneous Architecture for Industrial IoT
    – CHARIOT 7.2.1 Introduction Recently, cloud Computing as well as Internet of
    Things (IoT) technologies are rapidly advancing under the concept of future internet.
    Numerous IoT systems and devices are designed and implemented following industrial
    domain requirements but most of the times not considering recent risk relating
    to openness, scalability, interoperability as well as application independence,
    leading to a series of new risks relating to information security and privacy,
    data protection and safety. As a result, securing data, objects, networks, infrastructure,
    systems and people under IoT is expected to have a prominent role in the research
    and standardization activities over the next several years. CHARIOT EC co-funded,
    research project, clearly recognises and replies to this challenge, identifying
    needs and risks and implementing a next generation cognitive IoT platform that
    can enable the creation of intelligent IoT applications with intelligent shielding
    and supervision of privacy, cyber-security and safety threats, as well as complement
    existing IoT systems in non-intrusive ways and yet help guarantee robust security
    by placing devices and hardware as the root of trust. The scope of this article
    is to provide a detailed overview of the CHARIOT vision, technical objectives
    and overall solution, a high-level presentation of the system architecture as
    the project approaches in the design of the CHARIOT solution and platform. 7.2.2
    Business Challenge and Industrial Baselines The CHARIOT project activities are
    aligned with actual business and industrial requirements on the recent needs on
    data safety, security and privacy over modern IoT systems following demands of
    highly increasing numbers of IoT devices. It is expected that by 2025, there will
    be 75 Billion IoT-connected devices World Wide while spending on IoT devices and
    services reached $2 trillion in 2017, with China, North America, and Western Europe
    accounting for 67% of all devices [8]. This growth in connected devices is anticipated
    accelerate due to a rise in adoption of cross-industry devices (LED lighting,
    HVAC systems, physical security systems and lots more). On top of this CHARIOT
    also recognizes various IoT security breaches that have been dominating headlines,
    while 96% of security professionals expect an increase in IoT breaches this year
    [13]. In the direction of a more secure IoT infrastructure, there have been some
    requests for government regulation of the IoT, asserting that IoT manufacturers
    and customers are not paying attention to the security of IoT devices [14]. CHARIOT
    has clearly recognized the above requirements and has an aligned set of objectives
    towards increase of security, privacy and safety of industrial IoT networks and
    components. 7.2.3 The CHARIOT EC, Research Project – Vision and Scope CHARIOT
    (Cognitive Heterogeneous Architecture for Industrial IoT) is an EC, co-funded,
    research project granted under the IoT-03-2017 – R&I on IoT integration and platforms
    as a Research and Innovation (RIA) EC topic. The CHARIOT consortium consists of
    research and innovation organisations from major research streams all merged into
    the CHARIOT solution providing the competence to deliver a ‘holistic approach
    addressing Privacy, Security and Safety of IoT operation in industrial settings
    with safety critical elements’. The consortium includes competences in the fields
    of Project management and IoT governance (INLECOM, UK), Cognitive Architectures
    & Platforms for IoT (IBM, Ireland), Static source code analysis tools (CEA, France),
    Analytics Prediction models and Dashboard development (EBOS, Cyprus) as well as
    IoT deployment architectures, cloud/fog technologies (VTLN, Belgium, TELCOSERV,
    Greece), security including cybersecurity (ISC, ASPISEC, Italy) and integration
    aspects (CLMS, Greece). CHARIOT provides a design method and cognitive computing
    platform supporting a unified approach towards Privacy, Security and Safety (PSS)
    of IoT Systems including the following innovations summarised below: A Privacy
    and security protection method building on state of the art Public Key Infrastructure
    (PKI) technologies to enable the coupling of a pre-programmed private key deployed
    to IoT devices with a corresponding private key on a Blockchain system. This includes
    the implementation of security services utilising a cryptography-based approach
    and IoT security profiles all integrated to the CHARIOT platform. A Blockchain
    ledger in which categories of IoT physical, operational and functional changes
    are both recorded and affirmed/approved by the various run-time engines of the
    CHARIOT ecosystem while leveraging existing blockchain solutions in innovative
    ways. Fog-based decentralised infrastructures for Firmware Security integrity
    checking leveraging Blockchain ledgers to enhance physical, operational and functional
    security of IoT systems, including actuation and deactivation. An accompanying
    IoT Safety Supervision Engine providing a novel solution to the challenges of
    securing IoT data, devices and functionality in new and existing industry-specific
    safety critical systems. A Cognitive System and Method with accompanying supervision,
    analytics and prediction models enabling high security and integrity of Industrials
    IoT. New methods and tools for static code analysis of IoT devices, resulting
    in more efficient secure and safer IoT software development and V&V. CHARIOT is
    closely following a business and industrially driven approach to align the developed
    technologies and outcomes to actual industrial needs in the fields of transport,
    logistics etc and in general domains of IoT applications. With this vision, CHARIOT,
    will apply its outputs and recent developments to three living labs in order to
    demonstrate its realistic and compelling heterogeneous solutions through industry
    reference implementations at representative scale, with the underlying goal of
    demonstrating that Secure, Privacy Mediated and Safety IoT imperatives are collectively
    met, in turn delivering a key stepping stone to the EU’s roadmap for the next
    generation IoT platforms and services. The actual living labs will be implemented
    in the industrial framework of TRENITALIA (rail), Athens International Airport
    (transport) and IBM Ireland (smart buildings) [9, 10]. 7.2.4 CHARIOT Scientific
    and Technical Objectives We present below a summary of the CHARIOT scientific
    and technical objectives as the main scope and outcomes of the CHARIOT unified
    design method and cognitive computing platform supporting a unified approach towards
    Privacy, Security and Safety (PSS) of IoT Systems, that places devices and hardware
    at the root of trust, in turn contributing to high security and integrity of industrial
    IoT. Objective 1: Specify a Methodological Framework for the Design and Operation
    of Secure and Safe IoT Applications addressing System Safety as a cross cutting
    concern. The CHARIOT design method will bridge the systems engineering gaps that
    currently exists between a) the formal safety engineering techniques applied in
    the development and testing of safety critical systems and b) the rapidly evolving
    and ad-hoc manner in IoT devices are developed and deployed. This includes classification
    and usage guidelines of relevant standards and platforms, introduction of new
    concepts and methods for coupling pre-programmed private security keys on the
    IoT device with a Blockchain system and ledger to enhance its security and privacy
    protection and guarantee that only authorised entities who have a matching key
    can influence operation, function and change, thereby invalidating the potential
    for a substantial spectrum of cyber-attacks and significantly before they become
    actual exploits. Developments will also include a specialized static source code
    analysis tool and cross-compiler to help avoid safety defects and add some meta-data
    into the binary permitting that binary executable to be suitably “filtered” or
    “authenticated” by gateways and, in turn, shielding against cyber-attacks while
    consolidate all the above into the CHARIOT IoT Design Method. Objective 2: Develop
    an Open Cognitive IoT Architecture and Platform (the CHARIOT Platform), that exhibits
    intelligent safety behaviour in the diverse and complex ways in which the safety
    critical system and the IoT system will interact in a secure manner. This includes
    the creation of an open IoT Cognitive Architecture for a “Web-of-Things” like
    environment, supporting a range of solutions and applications interacting with
    highly distributed, heterogeneous and dynamic IoT and critical safety system environments.
    Under this objective, CHARIOT will also provide interfacing to a topological representation
    and functional behaviour models of IoT system components and safety profiles as
    well as a integrated IoT Platform by enhancing the existing state of the art in
    cognitive computing platforms and build the additional CHARIOT safety and privacy
    features through open APIs and including security services utilising the Blockchain
    technology, the IoT security profiles and fog computing services. Objective 3:
    Develop a runtime IoT Privacy, Security and Safety Supervision Engine (IPSE) which
    will act continuously to understand and monitor the cyber-physical ecosystem made
    up of the IoT devices, safety critical systems and a PSS policy knowledge-base
    in real-time. This cognitive engine will ensure that potentially endangering behaviours
    of the IoT system are predicted and avoided and, where that is not possible, handled
    in an agreed manner in conjunction with safety critical systems runtime environments
    to avoid a breach of the safety constraints. IPSE will include four innovative
    cognitive applications: A Privacy Engine based on PKI and Blockchain technologies,
    a Firmware Security integrity checking, an IoT Safety Supervision Engine (ISSE)
    and an Analytics Prediction models and Dashboard. Objective 4: Test and validate
    against Industrial IoT safety in three Living Labs (LLs) addressing different
    industrial areas in IoT safety: in transport (rail and airports) and in buildings.
    The LLs will be used to demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed approach
    and provide compelling and representative industry use cases with associated test
    data that will effectively demonstrate an integrated end-to-end application for
    how the broader CHARIOT approach to security, privacy and safety will be applied
    in different industry-representative contexts at enterprise scale. Objective 5:
    Ensure large outcomes scale up through wide dissemination, exploitation actions
    and a Capacity Building Programme aiming at infrastructure sustainability, organisational
    development, and human capital development through training on the practical use
    of the CHARIOT Concepts, Capabilities, Services and Platform Offering. 7.2.5 Technical
    Implementation The technical implementations in CHARIOT will be performed in a
    series of phases, perfectly aligned to the project scientific objectives presented
    above. These include the design, development, integration and testing of several
    key-components as will be presented in the chapters that follow. 7.2.5.1 The CHARIOT
    Open IoT cognitive cloud platform The CHARIOT cognitive platform comprises of
    a set of functions, logical resources and services hosted in a cloud data centre
    supporting a range of cognitive solutions and application interacting with an
    ecosystem of highly distributed, heterogeneous and dynamic IoT and critical safety
    system environments. This module provides connectivity and intelligence, supporting
    actuation and control features as required by the final applications. It takes
    advantage of an existing IoT platform (IBM’s Watson IoT [15]) to demonstrate concept
    and capability and will also support integration with other safety, privacy and
    machine-learning cloud services via relevant open APIs, thus supporting third
    party integration and innovation. Through such interfaces, the CHARIOT platform
    will subsequently be compatible with existing international developments, addressing
    object identity management, fog, discovery services, virtualisation of objects,
    devices and infrastructures and trusted IoT approaches. The CHARIOT platform is
    being designed respecting open principles. While the open nature of the architecture
    does not preclude the adoption of specific vendor technologies in the initial
    platform Proof-of-Concept (PoC) implementation for the living labs, the architecture
    will be intentionally designed with open interfaces such that individual middleware
    and components can be easily substituted with alternatives in future implementations.
    The platform will also explore the development and deployments of probes to provide
    methods of collecting information on the IoT devices and on the safety-critical-systems
    in real-time, in turn facilitating the creation of a topological representation
    and functional behaviours of the IoT systems by the Safety Supervision Engine.
    The cognitive engine will be used to test the concept of adapting autonomously,
    instructing the “system” to behave in intended ways and perform required updates
    and changes through authorised actors. Based on a pattern of events evidenced
    in ledgers, the cognitive system will adapt/instruct the IoT system(s) to adapt
    in appropriate ways based on leveraging innovative machine learning and data mining
    approaches. PKI and Blockchain Technologies Leveraging existing blockchain technologies
    along with traditional PKI schematics enables CHARIOT to revolutionize the field
    of identity management and access control. Blockchain acts as the backbone of
    the system by enabling trust between the various CHARIOT services as well as between
    the gateways and the IoT sensors within the network. The implementation will be
    based on a permissioned blockchain that will become the mediator of any communications
    occurring within the network. 7.2.5.2 Static code analysis and firmware security
    tool A significant component of the CHARIOT overall solution is the development
    and enhancement of a free software cross-compilation toolset – leveraging on existing
    open source technologies – for IoT engineers designing IoT systems and developing
    source code running on them. Strong highly safety-critical IoT software requires
    a costly, but extensive, formal methods approach [11], in which developers agree
    to put a lot of efforts in formally specifying then analysing their source code
    and using proof assistants to ensure lack of bugs (w.r.t. some explicitly, detailed
    and formalized specification). But the CHARIOT project aims to help less life-critical
    IoT software developers by providing them with a tool to help them in developing
    IoT software and better use of existing free software IoT frameworks. This will
    be an open software toolset that assists IoT software developers, particularly
    as not experts in computer science but a competent engineer in a specific industrial
    domain (railroad, automotive, smart building, maritime, etc.), so even heuristic
    source code analysis techniques (leveraging above some formal methods approaches)
    can improve his/her coding productivity. This tool will be developed as part of
    the CHARIOT solution and a plugin/extension module for GCC based compilers that
    the software industry is currently using and will be executed at compilation/linking
    stage and will use meta-programming techniques to foster “declarative” high-level
    programming styles. This will enable the developers (as the IoT device firmware
    developers) to identify most safety critical functions executed at the IoT device
    or gateway level. Also, firmware compiled with that toolset will carry some cryptographic
    signature to enable filtering of firmware updates in the gateway. 7.2.5.3 Integrated
    IoT privacy, security and safety supervision engine This engine is a set of novel
    runtime components which act in concert to understand and monitor the cyber-physical
    ecosystem made up of the IoT gateway and devices, the safety critical systems
    and safety/security policy knowledge-base. The Privacy Engine utilises existing
    security protocols and technologies such as Blockchain to provide a strong foundation
    for the trusted interchange of information about and between the participants
    in the system-of-systems. The Safety Engine also analyses the IoT topology and
    signal metadata relative to the relevant safety profiles and applies closed-loop
    machine-learning techniques to detect safety violations and alert conditions.
    The objective of this engines is to develop a cognitive engine that will leverage
    the Cyber-Physical topological representation of the system-of-systems combined
    with the security/safety-polices to provide a real-time risk map will allow for
    both static analysis and continuous monitoring to assess safety impact and appropriate
    response actions. The supervision engine will be responsible for interacting with
    the CHARIOT IoT platform, providing the centralised intelligence and control functionality
    for applying the necessary privacy, security, and safety policies to all components
    in the IoT system of systems, monitor IoT devices and systems to detect abnormalities
    in their behaviour and analyse their causes, maintain an internal topological
    representation of the constantly evolving IoT system of systems and collect and
    represent PSS policies and the threat intelligence in the topology to provide
    a real-time risk map, impact assessment and triggering of appropriate response
    actions. The engine will also maintain safety, security and privacy even when
    unknown devices and sensors are connected to the network, ensuring that they do
    not interfere to the normal operation of existing IoT components, assess the topology
    to detect whether the IoT ecosystem has entered or is predicted to be advancing
    towards an abnormal (unsafe/insecure) state, and automatically activate a safety
    remediation in response to this unsafe state, to reduce the impacts on users and
    other IoT components and restrict abnormal operations and allow operations of
    safe functions to maintain at reduced level the operation of the controlled system.
    7.2.5.4 Analytics prediction models user interface This system component is an
    innovative cognitive web application, which constitutes together with other relevant
    components – such as the Privacy and the IoT Safety Supervision Engine – the IPSE.
    The application collects the data received by the various IoT gateways and sensors
    in the fog network and using appropriate algorithms, Analytics Prediction models
    will be created and presented through a user friendly configurable dashboard.
    This module will be the advanced-intelligence dashboard for both understanding
    of the IoT ecosystem topology and for post data analytical purposes to assist
    in the refinement and improvements of PSS policies while at the same time act
    as the interface between the CHARIOT platform and the system operator/user. 7.2.6
    System Demonstration, Validation and Benchmarking The overall system operation
    will be demonstrated and validated via full integration to the actual operating
    environments and infrastructures of three industrial sites over precise key-performance-indicators
    that contribute to the separate business environment and value. The three key
    selected sites (living labs, LLs) will be: a) Trenitalia (transport – rail) b)
    IBM Ireland business campus (smart buildings) and c) Athens international airport
    (transport – airport). Details on the three separate cases have been included
    below: 7.2.6.1 Living lab 1: Trenitalia The primary objective in this LL is to
    enhance the safe operation of the Italian railways service. This includes, reduction
    of risk to passengers and personnel, compliance with appropriate regulations,
    and creation of a safe and efficient operating environment in the railways. At
    the same time this use case will focus on utilizing the feed from IoT used to
    monitor electrical and mechanical components dedicated on assessing energy consumption
    and dispatch them to the on-board control servers and the land-based central control
    system. The application of the CHARIOT tool will facilitate the timely recognition
    of sensors malfunction, along with prediction of maintenance requirements. 7.2.6.2
    Living lab 2: IBM business campus In this LL, the objective will be to enable
    the continued IoT evolution of the IBM technology campus from a set of individuals
    “automated/smart” buildings into to a truly cognitive IoT environment that provides
    a safer and more efficiently managed working environment for all IBM staff, customers
    and visitors and also to use the knowledge gained to help drive advancements in
    Cognitive IoT to a global scale by reflecting it in IBM products and services.
    7.2.6.3 Living lab 3: Athens international airport The application of CHARIOT
    in this Living Lab will address safety of airport Infrastructures, enhance protection
    of Athens airport’s facilities from physical and cyber threats. To achieve this,
    CHARIOT will enhance airports capability on early detection/prediction of hazardous
    situations, in parallel with reduction in false positive alarms that disrupt airport
    operations. 7.2.7 Summary and Discussion This chapter provides the overall concept
    of the CHARIOT project and business orientation. It summarizes the project scope
    and business value as derived from actual industrial needs in the framework of
    safety, security and privacy of industrial IoT. CHARIOT started in January 2018
    and it currently in the stage of requirements extraction and definition of the
    system overall architecture as this is aligned with the project end-users (living
    labs) that drive and validate the technological developments. Currently, CHARIOT
    is also defining the technical and methodological framework of the overall solution
    adapted for the cases of the three living labs that is going to evolve into the
    concise implementations for the next project phases, in a systematic approach
    to Privacy, Security, and Safety in Industrial IoT environments, using a strategic/objectives
    driven systematic way, in a process of continuous improvement. CHARIOT intends
    to have a first implementation of the system within the first months of 2019 and
    will integrate this to all infrastructures involved and as planned. This project
    has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation
    programme under grant agreement No 780075”. The authors acknowledge the research
    outcomes of this publication belonging to the CHARIOT consortium. 7.3 ENACT: Development,
    Operation, and Quality Assurance of Trustworthy Smart IoT Systems Until now, IoT
    system innovations have been mainly concerned with sensors, device management
    and connectivity, with the mission to gather data for processing and analysis
    in the cloud in order to aggregate information and knowledge [16]. This approach
    has conveyed significant added value in many application domains, however, it
    does not unleash the full potential of the IoT [82]. The next generation IoT systems
    need to perform distributed processing and coordinated behaviour across IoT, edge
    and cloud infrastructures [17], manage the closed loop from sensing to actuation,
    and cope with vast heterogeneity, scalability and dynamicity of IoT systems and
    their environments. Moreover, the function and correctness of such systems has
    a range of criticality from business critical to safety critical. Thus, aspects
    related to trustworthiness such as security, privacy, resilience and robustness,
    are challenging aspects of paramount importance [16]. Therefore, the next generation
    of IoT systems must be trustworthy above all else. In ENACT, we will call them
    trustworthy smart IoT systems, or for short; trustworthy SIS. Developing and managing
    the next generation trustworthy SIS to operate in the midst of the unpredictable
    physical world represents daunting challenges. Challenges, for example, that include
    that such systems always work within safe operational boundaries [18] by controlling
    the impact that actuators have on the physical world and managing conflicting
    actuation requests. Moreover, the ability of these systems to continuously evolve
    and adapt to their changing environments are essential to ensure and increase
    their trustworthiness, quality and user experience. DevOps is a philosophy and
    practices that covers all the steps from concept to delivery of a software product.
    In ENACT we see DevOps advocating a set of software engineering best practices
    and tools, to ensure Quality of Service while continuously evolving complex systems,
    foster agility, rapid innovation cycles, and ease of use [19]. DevOps has been
    widely adopted in the software industry. However, there is no systematic DevOps
    support for trustworthy smart IoT systems today [18–20]. The aim of ENACT is to
    enable DevOps in the domain of trustworthy smart IoT systems. 7.3.1 Challenges
    The key research question of ENACT is thus the following: “how we can tame the
    complexity of developing and operating smart IoT systems, which (i) involve sensors
    and actuators and (ii) need to be trustworthy?”. Our fundamental approach is to
    evolve DevOps methods and techniques as baseline to address this issue. We thus
    refine the research question as follows: “how we can apply and evolve the DevOps
    tools and methods to facilitate the development and operation of trustworthy smart
    IoT applications?”. Challenge 1: Support continuous delivery of trustworthy SIS.
    Currently there is little effort spent on providing solutions for the delivery
    and deployment of application across the whole IoT, edge and cloud space. In particular,
    there is a lack of languages and abstractions that can be used to support the
    orchestration of software services and their continuous deployment on heterogeneous
    devices [21] together with the relevant security mechanisms and policies. Challenge
    2: Support the agile operation of trustworthy SIS. The operation of large-scale
    and highly distributed IoT systems can easily overwhelm traditional operation
    teams. Other management models such as NoOps and Serverless Computing are evolving
    to solve this problem. Whatever the operations management model the major challenges
    will be to improve efficiency and the collaboration with development teams for
    rapid and agile evolution of the systems. Currently, there is a lack of mechanisms
    dedicated to smart IoT systems able to (i) monitor their status, (ii) indicate
    when their behaviour is not as expected, (iii) identify the origin of the problem,
    and (iv) automate typical operation activities. Furthermore, the impossibility
    of anticipating all the adaptations a system may face when operating in an open
    context, creates an urgent need for mechanisms that will automatically maintain
    the adaptation rules of a SIS. Challenge 3: Support continuous quality assurance
    strengthening trustworthiness of SIS. Maintaining quality of service is a complex
    task that needs to be considered throughout the whole life-cycle of a system.
    This complexity is increased in the smart IoT system context where it is not feasible
    for developers and operators to exhaustively explore, anticipate or resolve all
    possible context situations that a system may encounter during its operation.
    This is due to the open context in which these systems operate and as a result
    can hinder their trustworthiness. Quality of Service is particularly important
    when the system can have an impact on the physical world through actuators. In
    addition, testing, security assurance as well as the robustness of such systems
    is challenging [20]. 7.3.2 The ENACT Approach DevOps seeks to decrease the gap
    between a product design and its operation by introducing software design and
    development practices and approaches to the operation domain and vice versa. In
    the core of DevOps there are continuous processes and automation supported by
    different tools at various stages of the product life-cycle. In particular, the
    ENACT DevOps Framework will meet the challenges below and support the DevOps practices
    during the development and operation of trustworthy smart IoT systems. ENACT will
    provide innovations and enablers that will feature trustworthy IoT systems built
    by implementing the seven stages of the process as depicted in Figure 7.6. Plan:
    The ENACT approach is to introduce a new enabler to support the risk-driven and
    context-aware planning of IoT systems development, including mechanisms to facilitate
    the selection of the most relevant and trustworthy devices and services to be
    used in future stages. Figure 7.6 ENACT support of DevOps for trustworthy smart
    IoT systems. Code: The ENACT approach is to leverage the model-driven engineering
    approach and in particular to evolve recent advances of the ThingML [21] language
    and generators to support modelling of system behaviours and automatic derivation
    across vastly heterogeneous and distributed devices both at the IoT and edge layers.
    Build and Deploy: The ENACT approach is to provide a new deployment modelling
    language to specify trustworthy and secure orchestrations of sensors, actuators
    and software components, along with the mechanisms to identify and handle potential
    actuation conflicts at the model level. The deployment engine will automatically
    collect the required software components and integrate the evolution of the system
    into the run-time environment across the whole IoT, Edge and Cloud space. Test:
    ENACT enablers will allow continuous testing of smart IoT systems in an environment
    capable of emulating and simulating IoT and edge infrastructure by targeting the
    constraints related to the distribution and infrastructure of IoT systems. This
    system is intended to be able to simulate some basic attacks or security threats.
    Operate: The ENACT approach will provide enablers for the automatic adaptation
    of IoT systems based on their run-time context, reinforced by online learning.
    Such automatic adaptation will address the issue of the management complexity.
    The complexity of open-context IoT systems can easily exceed the capacity of human
    operation teams. Automatic adaptation will improve the trustworthiness of the
    smart IoT system execution. Monitor: The ENACT approach is to deliver innovative
    mechanisms to observe the: status, behaviour, and security level of the running
    IoT systems. Robust root cause analysis mechanisms will also be provided. In addition
    to the DevOps related contributions identified above, the ENACT DevOps Framework
    will provide specific cross-cutting innovations related to trustworthiness, which
    can be seamlessly applied, in particular based on the following ENACT concepts:
    Resilience and robustness: The ENACT approach is to provide novel solutions to
    make the smart IoT systems resilient by providing enablers for diversifying IoT
    service implementations, and deployment topologies (e.g., implying that instances
    of a service can have a different implementation and operate differently, still
    ensuring consistent and predictable global behaviour). This will lower the risk
    of privacy and security breaches and significantly reduced impact in case of cyber-attack
    infringements. Security, privacy and identity management: The ENACT approach is
    to provide support to ensure the security of trustworthy SIS. This not only includes
    smart preventive security mechanisms but also the continuous monitoring of security
    metrics and the context with the objective to trigger reactive security measures.
    7.3.3 ENACT Case Studies Three use cases from the Intelligent Transport Systems
    (Rail), eHealth and Smart Building application domains will guide, validate and
    demonstrate the ENACT research. 7.3.3.1 Intelligent transport systems This use
    case will assess the feasibility of IoT services in the domain of train integrity
    control, in particular for the logistics and maintenance of the rolling stock
    and on-track equipment. In this domain, the infrastructure and the resources that
    should be used are usually expensive and require a long-time in planning and execution.
    Therefore, the usage of the rail systems must be optimised at maximum, following
    security and safety directives due to the critical and strategic characteristics
    of the domain. This use case will involve logistic and maintenance activities.
    Within the ENACT scope, it will be focused on the logistics activities. A logistic
    and maintenance scenario will be defined with the aim to provide information about
    the wagons that form the rolling stock. This scenario will cover not only optimizing
    cargo storing and classification, but also providing the appropriate resources
    to assure the correct functioning of the system. These will be only possible if
    the train integrity is confirmed when the different wagons are locked and moving
    together. This situation will assure the proper transportation of cargo or passengers,
    avoiding possible accidents. This use case will involve an infrastructure consisting
    of large sets of on-board sensors (e.g., Integrity Detector, Asset data info,
    Humidity and temperature sensors) and multiple gateways interacting with cloud
    resources. 7.3.3.2 eHealth The eHealth use case will develop a digital health
    system for supporting and helping various patients staying at home to the maximum
    extent possible either during treatment or care. Elderly people are one type of
    subject in this case study. The Digital health system will feature elderly care
    to allow the subjects to live at home as long as possible. Another type of patients
    that we consider is Diabetes patients that need to follow their glucose level
    and regularly be followed up by health personnel. The digital health system will
    both control equipment normally present in smart homes to make life comfortable
    (automatic light control, door locks, heater control, etc.), and control various
    types of medical devices and sensors. These devices and sensors support the care
    and wellness for the specific patient and consist of a wide variety of types,
    including: blood pressure meter, scales, fall detection sensors, glucose meter,
    video surveillance, medicine reminder, indoor and out-door location etc). In addition,
    the system needs to integrate with other systems to provide information or alarms
    for example to response centres, care-givers, physicians, next of kin etc., and
    to feed information to medical systems such as electronic patient journals (EPJ).
    The pivotal role of the system’s Edge Computing will be what we denote “the medical
    gateway” which integrates sensors and devices, controls the edge and ensures the
    right data are provided to the various stakeholders and to integrated systems
    such as EPJ. 7.3.3.3 Smart building This use case will make use of smart building
    sensors, actuators and services. To this aim two sets of applications covering
    Smart Energy Efficiency and Smart Elderly Care will be developed within a Care
    Centre environment. Energy efficiency of new and existing buildings is crucial
    to achieve carbon emission reduction, and as we increasingly spend more time indoors,
    adequate levels of user comfort need to be guaranteed by the smart buildings.
    This implies a trade-off between energy use and the different aspects of users’
    comfort. They will be tested in the KUBIK, a smart building especially designed
    for testing new solutions for sustainable buildings. The use case will simulate
    a care centre consisting of small apartments where a group of elderly people live
    together. This care centre use case includes sensors and actuators that monitor
    and control the environment in order to ensure the safety of the facilities, to
    perform energy efficiency measures and also to support the care-takers in monitoring
    the wellbeing of users. The trend for smart buildings is to provide an increasing
    range of services supported by an increasing number of IoT sensors and actuators.
    Example of such services or applications include thermal comfort, visual comfort,
    energy efficiency, security, etc. Applications in this space need to share building
    infrastructure and may have conflicting objectives. The solution requires a clear
    hierarchy between the different actuation scenarios. 7.4 Search Engines for Browsing
    the Internet of Things – IoTCrawler Efficient and secure access to Big IoT Data
    will be a pivotal factor for the prosperity of European industry and society.
    However, today data and service discovery, search, and access methods and solutions
    for the IoT are in their infancy, like Web search in its early days. IoT search
    is different from Web search because of dynamicity and pervasiveness of the resources
    in the network. Current methods are more suited for fewer (hundreds to millions),
    static or stored data and services resources. There is yet no adaptable and dynamic
    solution for effective integration of distributed and heterogeneous IoT contents
    and support of data reuse in compliance with security and privacy needs, thereby
    enabling a true digital single market. Previous reports show that a large part
    of the developers’ time is spent on integration. In general, the following issues
    limit the adoption of dynamic IoT-based applications: The heterogeneity of various
    data sources hinders the uptake of innovative cross-domain applications. The large
    amount of raw data without intrinsic explanation remains meaningless in the context
    of other application domains. Missing security and neglected privacy present the
    major concern in most domains and are a challenge for constrained IoT resources.
    The large-scale, distributed and dynamic nature of IoT resources requires new
    methods for crawling, discovery, indexing, physical location identification and
    ranking. IoT applications require new search engines, such as bots that automatically
    initiate search based on user’s context. This requires machine intelligence. The
    complexity involved in discovery, search, and access methods makes the development
    of new IoT enabled applications a complex task. Some ongoing efforts, such as
    Shodan and Thingful provide search solutions for IoT. However, they rely mainly
    on a centralised indexing and manually provided metadata. Moreover, they are rather
    static and neglect privacy and security issues. To enable the use of IoT data
    and to exploit the business potential of IoT applications, an effective approach
    needs to provide: An adaptive distributed framework enabling abstraction from
    heterogeneous data sources and dynamic integration of volatile IoT resources.
    Security, privacy and trust by design as integral part of all the processes from
    publication, indexing, discovery, and subscription to higher-level application
    access. Scalable methods for crawling, discovery, indexing and ranking of IoT
    resources in large-scale cross-platform and cross-disciplinary systems and scenarios.
    Machine initiated semantic search to enable automated context dependent access
    to IoT resources. Monitoring and analysing the Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality
    of Information (QoI) to support fault recovery and service continuity in IoT environments.
    IoTCrawler is an EU H2020 project that addresses the above challenges by proposing
    efficient and scalable methods for crawling, discovery, indexing and ranking of
    IoT resources in large-scale cross-platform and cross-disciplinary systems and
    scenarios. It develops enablers for secure and privacy-aware discovery and access
    to the resources, and monitors and analyses QoS and QoI to rank suitable resources
    and to support fault recovery and service continuity. The project evaluates the
    developed methods and tools in various use-cases, such as Smart City, Social IoT,
    Smart Energy and Industry 4.0. The key elements of IoTCrawler are shown in Figure
    7.7. Figure 7.7 Key concepts of the IoTCrawler proposal. [40] 018 IEEE. The project
    aims to create scalable and flexible IoT resource discovery by using meta-data
    and resource descriptions in a dynamic data model. This means, for example, that
    if a user is interested in measuring temperature in a certain location, the result
    (e.g. list of sensors) should only contain sensors that can measure temperature,
    but the user may accept sensors that closely fulfil her/his application requirements
    even though all other characteristics may not be favourable (e.g. cost of acquisition
    may be high and sensor response time may be slow). For this reason, the system
    should understand the user priorities, which are often machine-initiated queries
    and search requests, and provide the results accordingly by using adaptive and
    dynamic techniques. 7.4.1 Architecture of IoTCrawler IoTCrawler provides novel
    approaches to support an IoT framework of interoperable systems including security
    and privacy-aware mechanisms, and offers new methods for discovery, crawling,
    indexing and search of dynamic IoT resources. It supports and enable machine-initiated
    knowledge-based search in the IoT world. Figure 7.8 depicts the IoTCrawler framework
    and highlights its key components, which are detailed next. 7.4.1.1 IoT framework
    of interoperable (distributed) systems The diversity of the market has resulted
    in a variety of sophisticated IoT platforms that will continue to exist. However,
    to evolve and enable the full benefits of IoT, these platforms need access to
    data, information and services across various IoT networks and systems within
    an integrated ecosystem of IoT resources. IoTCrawler envisions a cooperation of
    platforms and systems to provide smart integrated IoT based services. Nevertheless,
    instead of defining an overarching hyper-platform on top, the integration proposed
    by IoTCrawler is carried out by the definition of a common interface, enabling
    this way cooperation and interconnection of various platforms by making their
    data and services discoverable and accessible to other applications and services.
    An IoTCrawler-enabled platform can internally be implemented in different ways,
    since it only has to support the common and open interfaces to join the ecosystem.
    The open IoT interfaces are split in two planes that are called control and data
    planes. The control plane will coordinate and control the data and information
    processing in the platforms (monitoring and quality analysis). The data plane
    will allow for IoT data flow exchange between platforms (crawling, indexing and
    search). Figure 7.8 Overall architecture of the IoTCrawler framework. [40] 2018
    IEEE. 7.4.1.2 Holistic security, privacy and trust An ecosystem of IoT platforms
    brings immense benefits but also potential risks for users and stakeholders. The
    very principle that makes the IoT so powerful – the potential to share data instantly
    with everyone and everything – creates huge security and privacy risks. Since
    IoT systems are, by their nature, distributed and operate often in unprotected
    environments, the maintenance of security, privacy, and trust is a challenging
    task. IoTCrawler addresses quality, privacy, trust and security issues by employing
    a holistic and end-to-end approach to the data and service publication to search
    and access workflow. Device and connectivity management will ensure that the end
    devices only connect to trusted access networks. IoTCrawler develops solutions
    for mitigating privacy intrusion and data correlation based on data collected
    from multiple sources. Both technical and information governance procedures and
    guidelines are defined and implemented. This makes sure that the technical solutions
    are in place for avoiding the security and privacy risks, and also appropriate
    information governance procedures and best practices and measures are followed
    in development, deployment and utilisation of the use-cases and third-party applications.
    7.4.1.3 Crawling, discovery and indexing of dynamic IoT resources Information
    access and retrieval on the early days of the Internet and the Web mainly relied
    on simple functions and methods. For example, Yahoo’s first search engine was
    simply based on the “grep” function in Unix or the AltaVista search engine initially
    did not have a ranking mechanism. The Internet and the Web have gone a long way
    in the past two decades to improve the way we access the information on the Web.
    While the current information and search retrieval on the Web is far from ideal,
    there are several sophisticated methods and solutions that provide crawling, indexing,
    ranking and search and retrieval of extremely large volumes of information on
    the Internet. The new generations of Web search engines have now focused on information
    extraction, personalised and customised knowledge and extraction techniques and
    solutions. Some early works are demonstrated by Google’s knowledge graph, Wolfram
    Alpha and Microsoft Bing. The current information access and retrieval methods
    on the IoT are still at the same stage that the Web and the Internet were in their
    early days. Information retrieval on the large-scale IoT systems is currently
    based on the assumption that the sources are known to the devices and consumers
    or it is assumed that opportunistic methods will send discovery and negotiation
    messages to find and interact with other relevant resources in their outreach
    (e.g. Google’s recent Physical Web project is designed based on this assumption).
    Overall, IoT systems have more ad-hoc resources that do not comply with document
    and URL processing and indexing norms; the resources, such as mobile phones and
    sensing devices, can publish data and then move to another location or disappear.
    Service and data crawling and discovery for smart connected devices and services
    will also involve automated associations and integration to provide an extensible
    framework for information access and retrieval in IoT. IoTCrawler focuses on providing
    reliable, quality and resource-aware and scalable mechanisms for data and services
    publishing, crawling, indexing in very large-scale distributed dynamic IoT environments.
    7.4.1.4 Machine-Initiated semantic search In the past, search engines were mainly
    used by human users to search for content and information. In the newly emerging
    search model, information is provided depending on the users’ (human user or a
    machine) context and requirements (for example, location, time, activity, previous
    records, and profile). The information access can be initiated without the user’s
    explicit query or instruction but used on its necessity and relevance (context-aware
    search). This will require machine interpretable search results in semantic forms.
    Moreover, social media, physical sensors (numerical streaming values), and Web
    documents must be better integrated, and the search results should become more
    machine interpretable information rather than remaining as pure links (e.g. the
    Web search engines mainly return a list of links to the pages as their results;
    with some exceptions on popular questions and topics). IoTCrawler enables context-aware
    search and automated processing of data by semantic annotation of the data streams,
    thus making their characteristics and capabilities available in a machine processable
    way. There are several existing works that provide methods and techniques for
    semantic annotations and description of the IoT devices, services and their messages
    and data. However, most of these methods rely on centralised solutions and complex
    query mechanisms that hinder their scalability and wide scale deployment and use
    for the IoT. IoTCrawler supports an ecosystem of multiple platforms and develops
    dynamic semantic annotation and reasoning methods that will allow continuous and
    seamless integration of new devices and services by exploiting and adapting existing
    annotations based on similarity measures. The automatic discovery has to consider
    the current context. Context-awareness requires the integration and analysis of
    social, physical and cyber data. IoTCrawler develops enablers for context-aware
    IoT search. Hence the requirements of the different applications are mapped to
    the solutions by selecting resources considering parameters such as security and
    privacy level, quality, latency, availability, reliability and continuity. IoTCrawler
    improves reliability and robustness by fault recovery mechanisms and mitigation
    of malfunctioning devices using device activation/deactivation in the associated
    area. The fault recovery also requires mechanisms to support communication among
    networked IoT resources located in diverse locations and across different platforms,
    and to provide secure and efficient re-distribution of information in case of
    failure. 7.4.2 Use Cases IoTCrawler is currently evaluating its technologies in
    four real world use-cases: Smart Cities, Social IoT, Smart Energy, and Industry
    4.0 (see Figure 7.9). Further use-cases will be identified and ranked in co-creation
    workshops with the relevant stakeholders within the project. Figure 7.9 IoTCrawler
    use cases at a glance. 7.4.2.1 Smart city The city of Aarhus has been considered
    as a target for smart city deployment in the project. IoTCrawler helps to overcome
    the negative perceptions of Internet of Things and Smart Cities by developing
    smart city experimentation tools for Aarhus’ City Lab that can make citizens and
    companies engaged and be curious about smart city solutions. IoTCrawler also provides
    the enabling technologies to discover new data sources in Aarhus for Open Data
    platforms and has the potential to become a reference platform supporting IoT
    data and service sharing as part of the sharing economy. To track the performance
    of a smart city, IoTCrawler develops enablers for monitoring activity and quality
    of the sensors. This can be used to set up KPI’s for City Labs and to track its
    performance. The smart city deployment of Murcia is also considered in IoTCrawler,
    exploiting the large sensor platform installed. 7.4.2.2 Social IoT Social IoT
    relates to using sensors deployed at sports and entertainment events in order
    to quantify the performance of professionals or experience of participants. This
    enables participants to engage in events beyond simply watching, thus creating
    a unique personal record of their experience, and in combination with social and
    digital media allows event manager to create new insights and content for their
    audience. IoTCrawler has access to over 800 events, including fashion events (e.g.
    New York Fashion week), culinary events, sports events (e.g. Basketball Final
    Four), or events such as Miss Universe. For each event, sensors are deployed at
    local venues and participants and spectators are equipped with wearable devices.
    This results in a range of diverse data sets that are collected, analysed, stored,
    and used, e.g. for content creation. Discovering and semi-automatically describing
    existing sensors, data sets and streams using IoTCrawler technologies has the
    potential to significantly increase the overall value of the dataset access and
    their integration, making it accessible to a larger group of people and enabling
    new applications. As described above, the data sets include raw sensor data and
    processed analytic results. However, data processing often involves data from
    other third-party sources. For this reason, play-by-play data is used to correlate
    analytical results to match events, and social media sources can be used to link
    to user generated content. IoTCrawler’s discovery, indexing and search enablers
    have the potential to significantly reduce the effort associated with the integration
    of sensor technologies, and other external data sources. 7.4.2.3 Smart energy
    Smart Buildings play an important role in distributed energy systems as they turn
    from energy consumers to the so-called “energy prosumers”. In future energy systems,
    Smart Buildings actively interact with the Smart Grids in order to stabilise them
    or participate in energy trading as well as for structural condition monitoring
    and proactive maintenance. For this purpose, buildings offer semantically annotated
    properties of the technical equipment within especial energy flexibilities (i.e.
    for shifting electrical and thermal loads). In this frame, this use-case employs
    the technologies developed in IoTCrawler to dynamically discover the flexibilities
    of Smart Buildings and analyse their potential as well as their demand for applications
    that are necessary to manage and offer energy to the Smart Grid or the energy
    market. This information can be used by energy retailers or grid operators to
    deploy best fitting applications to individual buildings. The project uses semantic
    enrichment of grid data and data analytics to enhance smart grid applications
    and reduce the need for manual engineering and setup of systems. 7.4.2.4 Industry
    4.0 Industry 4.0 includes advances such as predictive maintenance, energy prediction,
    or human-robot collaboration. The results of IoTCrawler will be used to improve
    predictive maintenance planning for horizontal machining centres in aerospace
    and Die&Mould industries. Currently, data integration consumes more than 80% of
    the time in the industry. IoTCrawler has the potential to significantly accelerate
    the development and deployment of Industry 4.0 analytics solutions, by discovering
    and semi-automatically integrating machine metadata, sensor data provided by the
    machines and information stored in related enterprise databases. Extending the
    discovery to actuator services (e.g. air conditioning, heating, and machine operation)
    allows to link actions for avoiding load peaks to energy analytics pipeline. IoTCrawler
    also increases workers’ safety by identifying critical conditions (e.g. gas exposition)
    in the permanent sensor data stream of drones, and forward such condition markers
    to monitoring teams and production management subsystems. 7.4.3 Main Innovations
    in the Areas of Research The literature within key areas of the IoTCrawler proposal
    is reviewed next, indicating the main innovations of the work within the general
    framework described above. 7.4.3.1 Search and discovery Being essential for any
    network architecture, one of the key components of the proposed architecture is
    the search and discovery operation. Distributed Hash Table (DHT) is used to provide
    a high scalability in storage and a flexible support for query and update operations.
    DHT is a totally decentralised system that stores data objects for easy and quick
    access (query) and update (store). DHTs are built on top of overlay networks into
    which network objects are spread and identified with unique keys, e.g. the well-studied
    overlay network and DHT Chord mechanism [22], which is the direct ancestor of
    Kademlina [23] (BitTorrent’s DHT). Overlay networks and DHTs are well suited to
    form the basement of a proper discovery mechanism, such as the Overlay Management
    Backbone (OMB) approach [24]. To add suitable schema evolution to the information/content
    discovery, description mechanisms such as the Resource Description Framework (RDF)
    and JSON-LD [25] are needed. Combining a DHT mechanism with RDF, the work in [26]
    proposes to use an adapted version of RDQL [27] to perform the queries. The main
    problems of this approach are that it consumes a lot of storage space and that
    it is not efficient for simple searches. SPARQL [28] is the de facto query language
    for RDF, by providing a coherent and simple search mechanism. The IoTCrawler approach
    exploits the remarkable qualities of the overlay network and DHT described above
    to build a distributed discovery infrastructure. However, the nodes are deployed
    in separate domains to distribute both the storage/finding load and the management
    of information access. 7.4.3.2 Security for IoT In spite of the emergence of different
    cross-world initiatives in recent years (IERC, ITU-T SG20, IEEE IoT Initiative4
    or IPSO Alliance are just some of them), there is a lack of a unified vision on
    security and privacy considerations in the IoT paradigm, which embraces the whole
    lifecycle of smart objects that are making up the digital landscape of the future.
    In the IoT, data confidentiality and authentication, access control within the
    networks, privacy and trust among users and things are among some of the key issues
    [29]. IoTCrawler explores the use of advanced cryptographic techniques based on
    Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE). Specifically, it analyses the application and
    extension of the Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (CP-ABE) as a flexible
    and promising cryptographic scheme in order to enable information to be shared
    while confidentiality is still preserved. In CP-ABE, the cipher-text embeds the
    access structure to describe which private-keys can decrypt it, and the same private-key
    is labelled with descriptive attributes. IoTCrawler addresses the integration
    of CP-ABE with different signatures schemes to provide end-to-end integrity to
    the information that is shared for anticipatory purposes. Users are given means
    to define how their personal information is shared and under which circumstances
    using a policy-based approach. Additionally, IoTCrawler investigates the integration
    of this solution within the search and discovery process for IoT. The Blockchain
    paradigm [30] is also included in IoTCrawler. A Blockchain is a distributed database
    that maintains a continuously growing set of transactions in a way that is designed
    to be secure, transparent, highly resistant to outages, auditable, and efficient,
    at the same time it is distributed. However, despite the benefits that Blockchain
    technologies offer, we still need to overcome two major challenges in IoTCrawler.
    First, privacy, since transactions tend to be public, and encryption to protect
    transactions’ contents is not enough because it still allows the remaining nodes
    in the system to learn about the occurrence of a particular exchange in the system;
    and, second, scalability, because existing permission-less blockchains (e.g. Bitcoin)
    are only able to scale to a considerable number of nodes at the expense of attained
    throughput, e.g. Bitcoin’s throughput is about seven transactions per second.
    Moreover, IoTCrawler will leverage Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to enhance
    the security primitives deployed in the proposed framework, given that existing
    TEEs suffer from a number of shortcomings, especially with respect to their security
    and privacy provisions. In the area of Authentication, Authorisation and Accounting
    (AAA), IoTCrawler proposes a lightweight access control scheme based on Capability
    Tokens for IoT as presented in [31, 32], where these tokens act as a proof of
    possession providing a straightforward validation mechanism without requesting
    a third party. We propose a mechanism for interoperability of different authentication
    and authorisation solutions based on a bridge to third party elements, such as
    the standard stacks as LDAP and FIWARE Service Enablers to support a lightweight
    federation-like approach. 7.4.3.3 Data validation and quality analysis The assessment
    of Quality of Data can basically be evaluated in five common dimensions: Completeness,
    Correctness, Concordance, Plausibility and Currency. In [33] the authors provide
    a table of different terms used to describe one of the dimensions of data quality.
    Furthermore, they provide a mapping between data quality dimensions and data quality
    assessment methods. In [34] Sieve is introduced, a framework to flexibly express
    quality assessment methods and fusion methods. The STAR-CITY project [35] describes
    a system for semantic traffic analytics. Based on various heterogeneous data sources
    (e.g., Dublin bus activity, events in Dublin city), their system is able to predict
    future traffic conditions with the goal to make traffic management easier and
    to support urban planning. One of the major challenges in the assessment of quality
    metrics to sensory IoT data is the lack of ground truth. The authors of [36] and
    [37] developed and evaluated a concept for the assessment of node trustworthiness
    in a network based on data plausibility checks. They propose that every node performs
    a plausibility check to identify malicious nodes sending faulty data. Similar
    to this work, they use data sources in order to find “witnesses” for a given sensor
    reading. The authors in [38] propose three different approaches to deal with a
    missing ground truth in social media: spatiotemporal, causality, and outcome evaluation.
    Their concept to use spatiotemporal evaluation to predict future behaviour of
    humans is like the proposed IoTCrawler approach, disregarding that we evaluate
    past events. Prior work of the authors emphasised the importance of an appropriate
    distance model reflecting infrastructure, e.g., roads, and physics, i.e. traffic
    or air movements [39]. The approach in IoTCrawler refines the state of the art
    by utilising sensor and domain independent correlation and interpolation models
    whilst incorporating knowledge of the city infrastructure to evaluate data stream
    plausibility. 7.4.4 Conclusion This part presents the key ideas and the architecture
    of a crawling and discovery engine for the Internet of Things resources and their
    data. We describe our work in the context of the H2020 IoTCrawler project, which
    proposes a framework to make possible the effective search over IoT resources.
    The system goes beyond the state of the art through adaptive, privacy-aware and
    secure algorithms and mechanisms for crawling, indexing and search in distributed
    IoT systems. Innovative technological developments are proposed as enablers to
    support any IoT scenario. We discuss four use cases of the platform, which are
    presented in the areas of Smart Cities, Social IoT, Smart Energy and Industry
    4.0. The project is currently implementing the envisaged framework, at the same
    time the main interoperability issues are considered to support the real-life
    uses cases identified. This work has been sponsored by the European Commission,
    through the IoTCrawler project (contract 779852), and the Spanish Ministry of
    Economy and Competitiveness through the Torres Quevedo program (reference PTQ-15-08073).
    7.5 SecureIoT: Multi-Layer Architecture for Predictive End-to-End Internet-of-Things
    Security The proliferation and rising sophistication of Internet of Things (IoT)
    infrastructures and applications comes with a wave of new cybersecurity challenges.
    This is evident in several notorious security incidents on IoT devices and applications,
    which have occurred during the last couple of years. These include the “Lizard
    Stressor” attacks on home routers (January 2015), the 1.4 million cars that were
    recalled by Chrysler due to potential hacking of their control software (July
    2015), Tesla’s autopilot crash (July 2016), as well as the first large scale distributed
    denial of service (DDoS) attack based on IoT devices (October 2016). Most of these
    incidents are directly associated with the complexity, heterogeneity and dynamic
    behaviour of emerging IoT deployments, which poses security challenges, which
    can be hardly addressed by state of the art platforms. Some of the most prominent
    of these challenges, include: The fact that they provided limited support for
    end-to-end security, since they lack mechanisms that address IoT security at all
    levels, i.e. from the field and devices level to the edge and cloud levels. Moreover,
    existing security solutions tend to be framed within a single platform and ecosystem
    and cannot effectively operate in scenarios involving multiple platforms and ecosystems
    [41]. Their inability to deal with very volatile and dynamic environments comprising
    networks of smart objects. State-of-the-art IoT platforms and their security mechanisms
    provide within cloud-based environments that ensure cybersecurity for large numbers
    of IoT devices. Nevertheless, they make only limited provisions for dynamic applications
    involving networks of smart objects (i.e. objects with (semi)autonomous behaviour).
    In the latter, IoT devices and smart objects are likely to join or leave, while
    security and privacy policies can also change dynamically and without prior notice.
    Hence, to support large scale interactions across multiple IoT platforms and networks
    of smart objects, there should be some means of predicting and anticipating the
    security behaviour and trustworthiness of an IoT entity (e.g., device, platform,
    groups of objects) prior to interacting with it. SecureIoT is motived by the need
    to support cyber-security in scenarios involving cross-platform interactions and
    interactions across networks of smart objects (i.e. objects with semi-autonomous
    behaviour and embedded intelligence), which require more dynamic, scalable, decentralized
    and intelligent IoT security mechanisms. To this end, it introduces a multi-layer,
    data-driven security architecture, which collects and processes information from
    the field, edge and cloud layers of an IoT system, in order to identify security
    threats at all these layers and accordingly to drive notifications and early preparedness
    to confront them. Furthermore, SecureIoT foresees cross-layer coordination mechanisms
    and will employees advanced analytics towards a holistic and intelligent approach
    that will predict and anticipate secure incident in order to timely confront them.
    Also, SecureIoT introduces a range of security interoperability mechanisms in
    order to support cross-vertical and cross-platform cyber-security scenarios. The
    SecureIoT architecture serves as basis for the provision of security services
    to IoT developers, deployers and platform providers, including a risk assessment,
    a compliance auditing and a secure programming support service. In this context,
    the rest of this chapter is structured as follows: Section 2 introduces the SecureIoT
    architecture and its main principles. Section 3 discusses the security services
    to be offered by the project, while Section 4 presents some use cases that will
    be used to validate the project’s results. 7.5.1 SecureIoT Architecture 7.5.1.1
    SecureIoT architecture overview Figure 7.10. provides a high-level overview of
    the security architecture of the project. The architecture provides placeholders
    for predictive IoT security mechanisms, which can be contributed by different
    security experts in order to protect IoT infrastructures and services. In the
    scope of SecureIoT the partners will specify and implement such mechanisms in
    the areas of security monitoring and predictive analysis, which will serve as
    a basis for supporting the project’s use cases. Nevertheless, the project’s architecture
    is more general and therefore able to accommodate additional algorithms and building
    blocks. The architecture complies with the reference architectures specified by
    the Industrial Internet Consortium (IIC) and the OpenFog consortium [42], as it
    specifies: (i) The field level, where IoT devices (including smart objects) reside;
    (ii) The fog/edge level, which controls multiple devices close to the edge of
    the network. Note that the fog/edge level might be the first security layer in
    an IoT application, especially when resource constrained devices are deployed;
    (iii) The enterprise and platform levels, which reside at the core and where application
    and platform level security measures are applicable. Moreover, the SecureIoT architecture
    will also specify: Figure 7.10 Overview of SecureIoT Architecture. Interfaces
    for (security) data collection at all levels of the security architecture, including
    monitoring probes that are deployed at all levels. Data analytics modules (including
    AI and predictive analysis) at all levels, which extract insights about the future
    security state of the IoT infrastructure and applications. Semi-automated Policy
    Enforcement Points (PEPs), which are driven by predictive insights and enforce
    policies at different levels. PEPs will provide the means for enforcing security
    and cryptographic functionalities, configuring IoT platforms and devices for enhanced
    security, as well as for distributing security sensitive datasets. Multi-level
    security mechanisms and measures, which combine security monitoring, analytics
    and insights from multiple levels. Applicable policies and security measures are
    driven by regulations (e.g., GDPR), directives (e.g., NIS, ePrivacy) and standards
    (such as ISO27001 [43]). The ultimate goal of the architecture is to provide concrete
    services such as the SECaaS. The delivery of these services is facilitated by
    the development and maintenance of a security knowledge base, where metadata about
    IoT entities (i.e. objects platforms etc.) are registered along with knowledge
    collected and summarized based on multiple publicly available threat intelligence
    sources. Note that the security services of the architecture are offered as a
    service based on a Security-as-a-Service (SECaaS) paradigm. This however does
    not imply that the security services are solely deployed in the cloud. Rather,
    they can be offered based on a combination of cloud-based SaaS (Software-as-a-Service)
    security services and FaaS (Fog-as-a-Service) functions provided at the fog level.
    7.5.1.2 Intelligent data collection and monitoring probes Assessing and optimizing
    the security posture of IoT components require the collection and the processing
    of their respective monitoring and configuration data. The produced monitoring
    data will allow IoT stakeholders to assess the security posture of their IoT platforms,
    to predict security issues, to enforce policies for hardening systems, to prevent
    network misuse, to quantify business risk, and to collaborate with partners to
    identify and mitigate threats. The collection of these data requires the development
    of dedicated probes and monitoring layers at different levels of the deployed
    IoT platform (device, network, edge and core) to capture a comprehensive and a
    complete view of its operations and interactions. In SecureIoT, monitoring probes
    will be provided to support the collection of log data, including network flows
    and software configurations, at the component, services and network levels. A
    key characteristic of SecureIoT’s security monitoring infrastructure (and related
    probes) will be its built-in intelligence in the data collection and pre-processing
    mechanisms, which will be implemented over the SecureIoT monitoring probes that
    will interfaces to different IoT platforms. As part of this intelligence, the
    data collection mechanisms will ensure data quality, data filtering, as well as
    adaptive selection of the needed data sources based on dynamic changes to the
    configuration of the IoT platforms, applications and smart objects. In order to
    implement this intelligence, the monitoring probes will be enhanced with data
    streaming analytics mechanisms, which will be able to process security-related
    information sources on the fly (i.e. almost at real-time) in order to adapt the
    filtering and data collection accordingly. This data collection intelligence will
    facilitate fast processing, as well as the implementation of predictive analytics
    schemes. 7.5.1.3 SecureIoT systems layers and information flows Figure 7.11. presents
    the layers of a SecureIoT compliant system, with emphasis on the flow of information
    from an IoT platform to the SecureIoT SECaaS services. The following layers are
    presented: Figure 7.11 Layers of SecureIoT systems. A layer of an individual IoT
    platform or system, which typically comprises network, devices/field, edge/fog,
    cloud and application-level components. These components are usually part of the
    target IoT platform or systems that needs to be secured based on SecureIoT. A
    data collection layer, which comprises the above-mentioned security monitoring
    probes. Note that probes will be specified and developed for all parts and components
    of the IoT system i.e. from the network and devices components all the way up
    to the IoT applications’ components. A data analytics layer, which is destined
    to process the data derived from the various probes. This layer is empowered by
    data analytics algorithms, but also by a range of cybersecurity templates, which
    specify rules and patterns of the security incidents that are to be identified.
    Taking network-level attacks as example, templates for specific types of network
    attacks will be specified such as TCP SYN attacks, UDP flood attacks, HTTP POST
    DoS (Denial of Service) attacks [43]. Each of the templates will comprise the
    rules and conditions under which the attacks will be identified. Likewise, templates
    for other types of attacks, including application specific ones will be specified
    and used. Along with these templates, the data analytics layer will comprise a
    contextualization component, which will be used to judge whether the attacks indicators
    are abnormal for the given IoT platform and application context. A cross-platform
    layer, which is destined to aggregate and correlate information derived from multiple-IoT
    platforms. It will serve as a basis for identifying attack indicators in cross-platform
    scenarios. All of the above layers and components will leverage the services of
    a knowledge base that will comprise information and knowledge about IoT-related
    cybersecurity attacks. It will be also used to drive the operation of the IoT
    security templates and the contextualization component. 7.5.1.4 Mapping to RAMI
    4.0 layers SecureIoT is destined to support cybersecurity scenarios in both consumer
    and industrial settings. In order to strengthen the industrial relevance of the
    project’s architecture, the project will provide a mapping of the main building
    blocks of the SecureIoT architecture to the Reference Architecture Model Industry4.0
    (RAMI 4.0) [45]. While this mapping is work in progress, the following associations
    and mappings are envisaged: The SecureIoT field layer, maps to the Field and Control
    Device hierarchy levels of RAMI4.0, as well as to its Asset Integration layer.
    The SecureIoT edge layer, maps tot eh Station and Workcenter hierarchy levels
    of RAMI4.0, as well as to its Asset, Integration and Communication layers. The
    SecureIoT cloud layer, maps to the Workcenter, Enterprise and Connected World
    hierarchy levels of RAMI4.0, as well as to its Information, Functional and Business
    layers. The SecureIoT application layer, maps to the Enterprise and Connected
    World hierarchy levels of RAMI4.0, as well as to its Business layer. The SecureIoT
    data collection layer, maps to the Field Device, Control Device, Station and Work
    Centers hierarchy levels of RAMI4.0, as well as to its Communication and Information
    layers. The SecureIoT analytics layer, maps to the Enterprise and Connected World
    hierarchy levels of RAMI4.0, as well as to its Information layer. The SecureIoT
    management layer, maps to the Enterprise and Connected World hierarchy levels
    of RAMI4.0, as well as to its Information, Functional and Business layers. 7.5.2
    SecureIoT Services Based on its architecture, the project will offer risk assessment,
    compliance auditing and programmers’ support services as outlined in the following
    paragraphs. 7.5.2.1 Risk assessment (RA) services The SecureIoT RA services will
    aim at an efficient balance between realizing opportunities for gains, while minimizing
    vulnerabilities and losses. They will strive to ensure that an acceptable level
    of security is provided at an affordable cost. The SecureIoT framework will quantify
    risks in terms of a “likelihood factor”, which will be calculated based on combination
    of the probability and impact of any identified vulnerabilities. This “likelihood
    factor” will be appropriately weighted and ultimately normalized based on a risk
    calculation model in-line with NIST’s Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS).
    Special emphasis will be paid in evaluating the criticality of risks associated
    with the behaviour and the operation of smart objects, as well as of services
    spanning multiple platforms. SecureIoT will therefore formulate a formal methodology
    and an accompanying model that will produce risk quantifications based on the
    identified vulnerabilities, potential threats and the impact estimation per potentially
    successful exploitation. SecureIoT will develop a risk quantification engine based
    on an expert system, which will provide flexibility in implementing different
    rules and assign different rates to the various risks. 7.5.2.2 Compliance auditing
    services This service will be delivered as a tool available to solution deployers,
    operators and end-users. Based on information collected through the security analytics,
    including the information of the IoT knowledge base. It will provide support for
    a set of security and privacy controls on the IoT infrastructures at multiple
    levels. The tool will be configured to support auditing of IoT infrastructures
    and services, against existing sets of security and privacy controls. The auditing
    will identify non-compliant behaviours and will provide recommendations about
    areas that require attention. Several prominent sets of security and privacy rules
    that will be supported concerning controls and measures specified in the scope
    of the GDRP regulation, NIS and ePrivacy directives. 7.5.2.3 Programming support
    services This service will enable developers to secure applications as part of
    their programming efforts. In particular, it will enable them to: (a) Enforce
    Distributed Access Control; (b) Ensure the cryptographic protection of data; and
    (c) Physical distribute sensitive data for enhanced security. These activities
    will be supported based on programming annotations, which will specify distributed
    access control, cryptographic protection and physical data distribution activities.
    A series of source generation, bytecode transformation and runtime reflection
    actions will be undertaken at specified Policy Enforcement Points (PEPs), which
    will be implemented at various levels i.e. the device, edge, core and application
    layers of the SecureIoT architecture. To this end, along with the security monitoring
    probes, the SecureIoT architecture will provide the means for configuring elements
    at the PEPs. 7.5.3 Validating Use Cases The project’s architecture and services
    will be validated in three use cases, which are briefly discussed in the following
    paragraphs. 7.5.3.1 Industrial plants’ security The use case will focus on plant
    networks for operations and support – e.g. SCADA, MES, PLCs, etc. – and enterprise
    networks connected to IoT-platforms providing support for automation and supply
    chain collaboration. The technical approach of the industrial IoT use case is
    twofold as reliability and availability of real world production must not be brought
    at risk. The following security challenges will be addressed, based on the SecureIoT
    services: Secure operations of connected factories with thread prediction: The
    SecureIoT risk assessment service will be therefore used to predict security issues
    arising from deployed automation technologies in a multi-vendor environment. Furthermore,
    SecureIoT’s prediction and mitigation services will enable the plant control to
    draw the right conclusions and prepare for attacks before they emerge. Compliance
    and Protection of product/user data in a multi-vendor environment: Factories need
    to protect product and user data sets. SecureIoT will be used in order to enforce
    privacy and data protection policies. Likewise, the compliance auditing SecureIoT
    service will be also used to identify and remedy gaps in the industrial IoT environment.
    Predictive Maintenance and Avoiding Machine Break-Downs in “Human in the Loop”
    Scenarios: Predictive maintenance requires trustworthy exchange, storage and processing
    of sensor and asset management datasets. Security analytics of IoT application
    level entities will be exploited as part of the SecureIoT risk assessment service
    in order to proactively identify issues with transmission and protection of datasets
    involved in the predictive maintenance process, in order to ensure the reliability
    of the process and avoid damages/losses in scenarios where machines foretell their
    lifetime and initiative actions in the supply chain (e.g., ordering of spare parts,
    scheduling of maintenance). 7.5.3.2 Socially assistive robots This use case will
    focus on security challenges associated with the integration of a socially assistive
    robot (i.e. QT robot from SecureIoT partner LuxAI) with a cloud-based IoT platform.
    This integration will target the delivery of personalized ambient assisted living
    functionalities, such as personalized rehabilitation and coaching exercises. In
    order to support these applications a dense IoT network, enable continuous interaction
    between IoT devices, robots, human users and the environment will be established.
    The integration challenge will however lie on keeping track of the state of the
    robot and the environment, as well as on implementing distributed task assignment
    strategies (such as the Consensus-Based Bundle Algorithm (CBBA)), which enable
    the distribution of application logic across different smart objects. The following
    security challenges will be addressed: Network and message security: The SecureIoT
    risk assessment and mitigation services will be used to identify threats associated
    with communications and network performance in order to appropriately adapt the
    operation of the application (e.g., stop the training if needed and deliver proper
    alerts to users). Prediction and avoidance of dangerous/risky situations: SecureIoT
    will monitor the robots’ operation both at the software level (i.e. through information
    flow tracking) in order to identify possible hacking of the robot, but also at
    the application level in order to detect abnormal operation/behaviour that can
    lead at risk. Secure programming environment for robotics missions: The programming
    interfaces of the robot will be enhanced with SecureIoT programming model and
    annotations in order to enable the developer of a rehabilitation mission to enforce
    policies specified in some policy language such as XACML (eXtensible Access Control
    Markup Language). Compliance to GDPR: An analysis of the application for GDPR
    compliance will take place, including automated identification of non-compliance
    risks (based on the SecureIoT risk assessment) and subsequent implementation of
    GDRP compliant policies based on the secure programming XACML-based mechanisms.
    7.5.3.3 Connected car use cases This use case concerns security in connected cars
    scenarios, including: (i) Usage Based Insurance scenarios where vehicle data are
    analysed to assess driver behaviour and hence determine risks in order to better
    tailor insurance premiums for the customers; and (ii) Warnings on traffic and
    road conditions, that involve analysing data coming from multiple vehicles to
    understand the traffic conditions in different locations. From the point of view
    of cybersecurity for the usage-based insurance, it is important to ensure that
    the data transmitted is only accessible by the responsible organisation (privacy)
    and that the system cannot be corrupted such that a risky driver appears to be
    low risk. Moreover, the integrity of the data is a key requirement to ensure that
    insurance premiums are calculated fairly based on objectively assessed risk using
    accurate and trusted data. Likewise, for the traffic and road condition warnings
    it is vital that the data sent to the car is an accurate interpretation of the
    data provided from each vehicle. It This is because the system could be used maliciously
    to create congestion if the data is corrupted. Moreover, integrity of software
    running in the connected car is crucial. Recent attacks or security alarms raised
    has been focused on taking control over IoT devices and gateways. Over the air
    firmware update could be used as a countermeasure mechanism after an anomalous
    (or malware) detection. To address these challenges, the SecureIoT risk assessment
    framework will be employed, including predictive risk assessment functionalities.
    In case of identified issues, preventive measures will be activated (i.e. enforcement
    of data protection policies, provision of alerts to end-users, instigation and
    scheduling of over the air updates). 7.5.4 Conclusion SecureIoT is a first of
    a kind attempt to introduce a standards-based architecture for end-to-end IoT
    security. The project’s architecture is aligned to recent standards for industrial
    IoT security, including standards of the Industrial Internet Consortium and the
    OpenFog consortium. It makes provisions for collecting and analysing data from
    all layers of an IoT platform, while at the same time catering from cross platform
    and cross layer security analysis. Moreover, the SecureIoT architecture provides
    the means for defining and executing security actions at specific PEPs, as a means
    of enforcing policies and instigating mitigation actions. Based on this architecture,
    the project will implement risk assessment, compliance and the programming support
    services. SecureIoT is currently in its requirements engineering and specification
    phase, while it has also commenced its architecture specification activities.
    As part of the latter, the project will provide a mapping of its architectural
    concepts to the RAMI4.0 reference model. Moreover, the project will start the
    implementation of the data collection and data analytics mechanisms that will
    underpin the realization of the architecture and of its services. The project
    holds the promise to enhance the functionalities and lower the costs for securing
    IoT applications spanning multiple IoT platforms and smart objects. We will aspire
    to disseminate more detailed results through publications, presentations and other
    activities of the IERC cluster in the coming ten months. This work has been carried
    out in the scope of the H2020 SecureIoT project, which is funded by the European
    Commission in the scope of its H2020 programme (contract number 779899). The authors
    acknowledge valuable help and contributions from all partners of the project.
    7.6 SEMIoTICS 7.6.1 Brief Overview SEMIoTICS aims to develop a pattern-driven
    framework, built upon existing IoT platforms, to enable and guarantee secure and
    dependable actuation and semi-autonomic behaviour in IoT/IIoT applications. Patterns
    will encode proven dependencies between security, privacy, dependability, and
    interoperability (SPDI) properties of individual smart objects and corresponding
    properties of orchestrations involving them. The SEMIoTICS framework will support
    cross-layer intelligent dynamic adaptation, including heterogeneous smart objects,
    networks and clouds, addressing effective adaptation and autonomic behaviour at
    field (edge) and infrastructure (backend) layers based on intelligent analysis
    and learning. To address the complexity and scalability needs within horizontal
    and vertical domains, SEMIoTICS will develop and integrate smart programmable
    networking and semantic interoperability mechanisms. The practicality of the above
    approach will be validated using three diverse usage scenarios in the areas of
    renewable energy (addressing IIoT), healthcare (focusing on human-centric IoT),
    and smart sensing (covering both IIoT and IoT); and will be offered through an
    open Application Programming Interface (API). SEMIoTICS consortium consists of
    strong European industry (Siemens, Engineering, STMicroelectronics), innovative
    SMEs (Sphynx, Iquadrat, BlueSoft) and academic partners (FORTH, Uni Passau, CTTC)
    covering the whole value chain of IoT, local embedded analytics and their programmable
    connectivity to the cloud IoT platforms with associated security and privacy.
    The consortium is striving for a common vision of creating EU’s technological
    capability of innovative IoT landscape both at European and international level.
    7.6.2 Introduction Global networks like IoT create an enormous potential for new
    generations of IoT applications, by leveraging synergies arising through the convergence
    of consumer, business and industrial Internet, and creating open, global networks
    connecting people, data, and “things”. A series of innovations across the IoT
    landscape have converged to make IoT products, platforms, and devices, technically
    and economically feasible. However, despite these advancements the realization
    of the IoT potential requires overcoming significant business and technical hurdles.
    This includes several system aspects, including dynamicity, scalability, heterogeneity,
    and E2E security and privacy [46–48], as they are described below. IoT are dynamic,
    ever-evolving and often unpredictable environments. This relates to both IoT infrastructures
    as a whole (e.g. rapid development of new smart objects and IoT applications introducing
    new requirements to existing infrastructures and networks) and individual IoT
    applications (e.g. new users and types of objects connecting to said applications).
    This necessitates dynamically adaptive behaviour at runtime, at the IoT infrastructure,
    the IoT applications, and locally at the smart objects integrated by them. Intrinsic
    requirements (e.g. scale, latency) dictate the need for, at least, semi-autonomic
    adaptation at all layers. The fast-growing number of interconnected users, smart
    objects and applications requires high scalability of the IoT infrastructure and
    network layers. At the network, the vastly increased demands require highly efficient
    programmable connectivity, service provisioning and chaining in ways that guarantee
    the much-needed end-to-end (E2E) optimizations, addressing dynamic IoT application
    requirements. Scalability at the IoT infrastructure level requires seamless discovery
    and bootstrapping of smart objects, as well as highly efficient orchestration,
    event processing and analytics and IoT platform integration. Despite advancements
    in standardization, there is still limited semantic interoperability within IoT
    applications and platforms. Semantic interoperability requires three key abilities:
    (a) to recognize and balance the heterogeneous capabilities and constraints of
    smart objects, (b) to interpret data generated by such objects correctly, and
    (c) to establish meaningful connections between heterogeneous IoT platforms. Smart
    objects, IoT applications, and their enabling platforms are often vulnerable to
    security attacks and changing operating and context conditions that can compromise
    their security [49]. They also generate, make use of, and interrelate massive
    personal data in ways that can potentially breach legal and privacy requirements
    [49]. Preserving security and privacy properties remains a particularly challenging
    problem, due to the difficulty of: (a) analysing vulnerabilities in the complex
    E2E compositions of heterogeneous smart objects, (b) selecting appropriate controls
    (e.g., different schemes for ID and key management, different encryption mechanisms,
    etc.), for smart objects with heterogeneous resources/constraints, and (c) preserving
    E2E security and privacy under dynamic changes in IoT applications and security
    incidents, in the context of the ever-evolving IoT threat landscape [50]. The
    above challenges give rise to significant complexities and relate to the implementation
    and deployment stack of IoT applications to address them. The overall aim is:
    demands without considering the data volume. Taking into consideration this ratio,
    green IT technologies have important environmental and economic benefits. Circular
    Economy (CE) advocates a continuous development cycle that reforms the currently
    prominent ‘take-make-dispose’ linear economic mode by preserving and enhancing
    the natural capital. SEMIoTICS will also provide the intelligence analytics capabilities
    and Information Communication Technologies (ICT) that are required for turning
    IoT data into a worthy asset for CE-centric businesses (e.g. [51]). 7.6.3 Vision
    The main goal of the SEMIoTICS project is to develop a pattern-driven framework,
    built upon existing IoT platforms. The proposed framework will enable and guarantee
    the secure and dependable actuation and semi-automatic behaviour in IoT/IIoT applications.
    Specifically, the SEMIoTICS vision in delivering smart, secure, scalable, heterogeneous
    network and data-driven IoT is based on two key features: Pattern-driven approach:
    Patterns are re-usable solutions to common problems and building blocks to architectures.
    In SEMIoTICS, patterns encode proven dependencies between security, privacy, dependability
    and interoperability (SPDI) properties of individual smart objects and corresponding
    properties of orchestrations (composition) involving them. The encoding of such
    dependencies enables: (i) the verification that a smart object orchestration satisfies
    certain SPDI properties, and (ii) the generation (and adaptation) of orchestrations
    in ways that are guaranteed to satisfy required SPDI properties. The SEMIoTICS
    approach to patterns is inspired from similar pattern-based approaches used in
    service-oriented systems [52, 53], cyber physical systems [54] and networks [55,
    56]. Multi-layered Embedded Intelligence: Effective adaptation and autonomic behaviour
    at field (edge) and infrastructure (backend) layers depends critically on intelligent
    analysis and learning the circumstances where adaptation actions did not work
    as expected. Intelligent analysis is needed locally for semi-autonomous, prompt
    reaction, but taking into account IoT smart objects limited resources (thus requiring
    specialized lightweight algorithms) [55, 57]. It should also be possible to fuse
    local intelligence to enable and enhance analysis and intelligent behaviour at
    higher levels (e.g. using results of local analysis of “thing events” to globally
    predict and anticipate failure rates) [58]. 7.6.4 Objectives The SEMIoTICS project
    will target IoT applications with heterogeneous smart objects, various IoT platforms
    and different SPDI requirements. Seven main objectives are identified by the SEMIoTICS
    project including: The development of patterns for orchestration of smart objects
    and IoT platform enablers with guaranteed SPDI properties The development of semantic
    interoperability mechanisms for smart objects, networks, and IoT platforms, like
    semantic information broker that resolve the semantics of correlated ontologies
    and common APIs that enable cross-platform programming and interaction The development
    of dynamically and self-adaptable monitoring mechanisms, supporting integrated
    and predictive monitoring of smart objects in a scalable manner The development
    of core mechanisms for multi-layered embedded intelligence, IoT application adaptation,
    learning and evolution, and E2E security, privacy, accountability and user control
    The development of IoT-aware programmable networking capabilities based on adaptation
    and Software-Defined Networking (SDN)/Network Function Virtualization (NFV) orchestration
    The development of a reference prototype open architecture demonstrated and evaluated
    in both IIoT (renewable energy) and IoT (healthcare), as well as in a horizontal
    use case bridging the two landscapes (smart sensing), and delivery of the respective
    open API The adaptation of EU technology offerings internationally These objectives
    are accomplished, considering the intrinsic requirements of three main use case
    scenarios for an industrial wind park, an e-health system, and a smart sensing
    setting. 7.6.5 Technical Approach Figure 7.12 shows our initial vision of the
    logical architecture of SEMIoTICS framework and how it relates to smart objects,
    IoT applications, and existing IoT platforms, and how does it map onto a generic
    deployment infrastructure consisting of private and public clouds, networks, and
    field devices. Within the figure, blue boxes show components of the framework
    that are to be developed by SEMIoTICS; white boxes indicate components of IoT
    applications managed by the framework. The key role of the SEMIoTICS framework
    in the IIoT/IoT implementation stack is to support the secure, dependable and
    privacy-preserving connectivity and interoperability of IoT applications and smart
    objects used by them, and the management, monitoring and adaptation of these applications,
    objects and their connectivity. Figure 7.12 SEMIoTICS architecture (deployment
    and logic views). 7.6.5.1 Enhanced IoT aware software defined networks The sheer
    number of smart objects that are expected to connect to the Internet by 2020 (more
    than 50bn smart objects) will increase network traffic dramatically and introduce
    more diversity of network traffic (from elephant flows to mice flows). This makes
    the development of networking techniques that are significantly more scalable
    and agile than today’s networks an absolute necessity. Networks will need to dynamically
    reconfigure their resources and maintain network connectivity. Also, applications
    running on top of smart connected devices will need to be resource and network-aware,
    in order to take full advantage of underlying network programmability. In summary,
    IoT requires more agile networks. SDN can provide a solution to this problem.
    It allows network programmability, which can be used to decouple network control
    from the forwarding network (aka data) plane and to make the latter directly programmable
    by the former. Integrating IoT and SDN will increase network efficiency as it
    will make it possible for a network to respond to changes or events detected at
    the IoT application layer through network reconfiguration. If a spontaneous concentration
    of people in a specific place is detected by an IoT application, for example,
    the application can send a request to the SDN controller to reconfigure the network
    and provide more bandwidth to the area before network congestion occurs. As another
    example, consider an IoT application where sensor readings are transmitted periodically.
    In such cases, network resources on the path connecting the sensors to the backend
    IoT application can be reserved during the reporting cycles to enable efficient
    flows and released outside them. SEMIoTICS aims to develop a middleware layer
    between the IoT applications and the SDN-controlled field network, abstracting
    the underlying protocol implementations and SDN APIs. This will allow IoT applications
    to trigger the network reconfiguration through pattern-driven adaptations. In
    this view, SDN becomes another component in the IoT implementation stack which,
    like other components, can be dynamically configured through SPDI patterns [56].
    7.6.5.2 Localized analytics for Semi-Autonomous IIoT operation An IDC FutureScape
    report [59] for IoT reported that by 2018, 40 percent of IoT data will be stored,
    processed, analysed and acted where they are created before they are transferred
    to the network. There are two main reasons for this: big data volume and fast
    reaction. First of all, IoTs/IIoTs are generating an unprecedented volume and
    variety of data depending on the vertical use case. Not all these data need to
    be sent always to the cloud for storage and processing. Indeed, the volume of
    the data makes it in many cases extremely difficult to process them globally in
    an efficient manner and hinders learning the relations that are hidden in the
    data. For this reason, we need to enrich the generated and collected data with
    semantic information at the source and intermediate stations, process them locally
    with machine learning algorithms to extract the most important features of the
    data and only then transfer the learned local features to the cloud for further,
    global, processing and feature analysis. Hence, new approaches, techniques, and
    corresponding designs need to be developed to store, analyse, and derive insight
    from these data sets. This has already been identified as a challenge by the industry,
    e.g. Forrester [60] highlighting the need of IoT applications for distributed
    analytics since centralized analytics cannot cope for many IoT usage scenarios,
    and Gartner [61] emphasizing the importance of IoT edge architecture and IT/OT
    integration for achieving such distributed and layered data analysis. The second
    reason driving the need for localized analytics is fast reaction. By the time
    the data makes its way to the cloud for analysis and some analysis results have
    been obtained and transferred back to the field layer, so much time has passed
    that the opportunity to act effectively on the obtained analysis results at the
    field layer (e.g. smart actuation) is usually long gone. Again, this is a crucial
    requirement for the industry – Forbes and Moor Insights & Strategy (MI&S) [62]
    expects that machine learning-enabled reaction to changes in the current environmental/system
    context to be essential for IoT solutions. By 2020 MI&S believes that the machine
    learning at edge combined with central machine learning in cloud arrangements
    will exist in a large number of solutions and will account for a great deal of
    the innovation in IoT world – giving a substantial market advantage to the providers
    of such solutions. By doing a fast analysis on the local data (whose volume is
    much reduced compared to the entire data produced by the IIoT/IoT system and thus
    should be analysable with substantially fewer resources), an IIoT/IoT system can
    react quickly to context changes and adapt to them, in ways that optimise the
    use of both its own resources and the environment’s, and eventually improving
    the overall user experience. SEMIoTICS will develop localized analytics at the
    edge for semi-autonomous operation with smart actuation and use the results of
    the localized analytics to help improve the subsequent, global analysis that will
    be performed on the cloud for learning across the whole system and extraction
    of global patterns – itself a task whose results can be used by local analytics
    mechanisms to improve their performance and be able to proactively react to situations
    that had not been observed at that local point in the past but had occurred at
    other parts of the system. 7.6.6 Security Architecture Concept As aforementioned,
    the SEMIoTICS vision is articulated around the development of a framework for
    smart object and IIoT/IoT application management based on trusted patterns, monitoring
    and adaptation mechanisms, enhanced IoT centric networks and multi-layered embedded
    intelligence. These core elements of our approach are described below. 7.6.6.1
    Pattern-based trustworthy IIoT/IoT The key element enabling the SEMIoTICS approach
    is the use of architectural SPDI patterns. These patterns define generic ways
    of composing (i.e., establishing the connectivity between) and configuring the
    heterogeneous smart objects and software components that may exist at all layers
    of the IoT applications implementation stack, including: sensors and actuators;
    smart devices; software components at the network, cloud, IoT enabling platforms
    and/or other middleware layer; as well as software components at the IoT application
    layer. To do so, patterns specify abstract and generic smart object interaction
    and orchestration protocols, enhanced (if necessary) by transformations to ensure
    the semantic compatibility of data. Furthermore (and more importantly), the smart
    object interaction and orchestration protocols encoded by the patterns must have
    proven ability (i.e., an ability proven through formal verification or demonstrated
    through testing and/or operational evidence) to achieve not only a semantically
    viable interoperability between the smart objects that they compose but also specific
    SPDI properties, which may be required of compositions. The compositions defined
    by patterns are both vertical and horizontal, i.e., they can involve smart objects
    at the same (horizontal) or different layers (vertical) layer of the IoT implementation
    stack. As an example of a pattern that guarantees “data integrity” – i.e., absence
    of unauthorized modifications of data – consider the integrity preserving cascade
    composition pattern discussed in [63, 64]. According to this pattern in a sequential
    composition of processes P1, …, Pn where the input data of Pi are meant to be
    the output data of Pi-1, and the communication between Pi-1 to Pi (i=2,…, n) is
    based on an orchestrator O which facilitates data transfers from Pi-1 to Pi, overall
    data integrity is preserved if data integrity is preserved within each Pi, within
    O and across all communications from PiS to O and vice versa. The integrity cascade
    composition pattern applies both to horizontal compositions (e.g., in software
    services workflows as in [63, 64]) and vertical composition (e.g., in transfer
    of data in invocation of operations of IoT enabling middleware). Another (more
    complex) example of a pattern fitting the SEMIoTICS vision is the synchronously
    controlled distribution line (SCDL) pattern discussed in [54]. SCDL guarantees
    that a distributed asynchronous sensor system installed upon a physical pipeline
    (e.g., a pipeline of an electricity distribution network) will operate in virtual
    synchrony and provide a guaranteed density of readings (i.e., a bounded minimum
    number of readings per distant and per time unit). The pattern suggests a composition
    consisting of: (i) sensors connected to a controller through a middleware component
    that realizes a bounded reliable message delivery protocol; (ii) a controller
    with the capability to authenticate sensors, store readings received from them
    in fixed length intervals, and substitute missing or corrupted sensor readings
    with synthetic readings computed through the linear interpolation of readings
    from their closest adjacent sensors and the end of reading intervals. The application
    of the SCDL pattern is proven to guarantee the consumption of readings at the
    end of the reading interval where they fit, make them available in a synchronous
    manner, filter out illegitimate readings and produce readings of the required
    density for the pipeline. In SCDL pattern, these properties are guaranteed even
    in the presence of missing or corrupted raw data, as long as there is a minimal
    number of legitimate sensor readings. Examples of additional patterns have been
    given in [52] and [56]. These include patterns for confidentiality in service
    orchestrations and patterns for availability in Software Defined Networks, respectively.
    Inspired by these earlier works, SEMIoTICS patterns will develop patterns specifying:
    Composition structures for integrating smart objects and components of IoT enabling
    platforms (e.g., platform enablers) in a manner that guarantees SPDI properties.
    The E2E SPDI properties that the compositions expressed by the pattern preserve.
    The component level SPDI properties that the types of smart objects and/or components
    orchestrated by the pattern, must satisfy in order to preserve the end-to-end
    SPD properties. Additional conditions that need to be satisfied for guaranteeing
    end-to-end SPDI properties. These may, for example, include configuration conditions
    that need to be satisfied by the IoT platforms and the networks providing the
    connectivity between them, for guarantying the end-to-end availability properties
    of IoT application (composition). Monitoring checks that must be monitored at
    runtime in order to verify that any assumptions about the individual smart objects
    and components that are orchestrated by a pattern or other operational conditions,
    which are critical for the preservation of the end-to-end SPDI properties of the
    pattern, hold at runtime. Adaptation actions that may be undertaken to adapt IoT
    applications, which realise the composition structure of the pattern, at runtime.
    Such actions may, for example, include the replacement of individual smart objects
    within a composition; the adaptation of the process realizing the composition;
    the modification of the configuration of the network services used to connect
    the smart objects of the composition and/or the deployment platforms upon which
    these objects run. Adaptation actions are specified along with guard conditions
    determining when they can be executed (guards are monitored, and adaptation is
    triggered when they are satisfied). SEMIoTICS will also develop a generic engine
    supporting the execution of patterns at runtime to realize the overall process
    of monitoring, forming, adapting and managing smart object orchestrations in IoT
    applications. 7.6.6.2 Monitoring and adaptation The SEMIoTICS framework will support
    evolving runtime management and adaptation of IoT applications and smart objects
    [55–58]. Adaptation will be triggered by monitoring the guard conditions of the
    patterns used by the IoT application of interest, and applying the actions defined
    in the patterns when such conditions are satisfied. The SEMIoTICS framework will
    also monitor and analyse the effectiveness of patterns and the adaptation actions
    undertaken in reference to the contextual and operational conditions in which
    they were undertaken. This will be to identify deficiencies or failures in applying
    the patterns, to diagnose the reasons which may have caused deficiencies or failures
    and avoid the application of the same pattern(s) under the same conditions in
    subsequent phases. The use of a specific type of network connectivity or a specific
    type of sensor object amongst alternative options may, for example, prove to be
    a non-optimal option for network performance or sensor signal reliability under
    particular conditions. Similarly, certain data transformations may prove excessively
    time consuming for achieving the required scalability in an IoT application. Monitoring
    will also be necessary to ensure that any component level SPDI properties assumed
    by the pattern are upheld whilst the pattern is active (i.e., in use) in an IoT
    application. Beyond the basic monitoring of the contextual circumstances surrounding
    the operation of different smart objects and IoT applications, the SEMIoTICS framework
    will incorporate learning and evolution mechanisms supporting the analysis of
    any adaptation and configuration actions undertaken for an IoT application. This
    will be necessary in order to identify whether the application of patterns is
    effective over time (e.g., it does indeed prevent the occurrence of breaches of
    SPDI properties) and what might be the reasons for not being effective when this
    is the case. 7.6.7 Use Cases SEMIoTICS will target three IoT application scenarios:
    two verticals in the areas of energy and health care and one horizontal in the
    areas of intelligent sensing. These scenarios have been selected since they involve:
    (a) different and heterogeneous types of smart objects (i.e., sensors, smart devices,
    actuators) and software components; (b) different vertical and horizontal IoT
    platforms; and (c) different types of SPDI requirements. Due to these dimensions
    of variability, our scenarios provide comprehensive coverage of technical issues,
    which should be accounted for in developing the SEMIoTICS approach and infrastructure,
    and to this end provide an effective way for driving the R&D work programme of
    SEMIoTICS and evaluating and demonstrating its outcomes. 7.6.7.1 Renewable energy
    – Wind energy Current state of the art of Wind Turbine Controller in a Wind Park
    control network is typically an embedded or highly integrated operating system,
    which follows rigorously development and pre-qualification prior to deployment
    in the real world. As a result of this slow process, new features, adding new
    sensors, actuators and related advancements require several months or even years
    to be fully matured and operational in the field. Taking local action on sensing
    and analysing structured data to find the inclination of a steel tower – When
    the nacelle is turned during a cable untwisting event (Sensing), the gravity acceleration
    (Ag) component measured by an accelerometer in longitude direction (Ay) will vary
    as a function of the inclination (Inc) of the steel tower. O&M personnel in remote
    control center wants to know the inclination of all the steel towers on a number
    of specific wind farms, as these details will have to be shared with the customer
    to monitor the deformation and fatigue of the steel. To find the inclination of
    a steel tower, a full cable-untwist procedure has to be activated. This happens,
    depending on wind conditions, 3–4 times a month. It is also possible to manually
    instruct the wind turbine to perform the unwind procedure. At the time of the
    unwindingprocedure a hi-frequency set of data is recorded. A relatively large
    amount of data is required to calculate the inclination. This datasheet needs
    to be sent back to the remote control center to model and calculate the inclination.
    In SEMIoTICS, localized edge analytics will be applied which will result in semi-autonomous
    IIoT behavior as only the container containing the algorithm and result of the
    inclination calculation is transferred to between the wind turbine and the remote
    control centre. The unnecessary data traffic between each turbine and remote control
    centre is greatly reduced. Without the localized analytics functionality, all
    the hi-frequency acceleration and nacelle position data should have transferred
    to remote control centre resulting in suboptimal operation. Smart Actuation by
    sensing unstructured video/audio data – Within the turbine, there are many events
    which can be captured by IIoT sensors such as Grease leakage detection during
    normal operation or unintended noise detection when the turbine rotor is changing
    the direction in the line of wind to maximize energy production. The sensing of
    this unstructured data and acting locally to prevent any damage to the parts of
    the turbine in the long run will be of key importance. Localized analytics, as
    proposed in SEMIoTICS, which will lead in smart actuation to protect the critical
    infrastructure of renewable energy resources. SEMIoTICS implements: Industrial
    Things semantic discovery, Bootstrapping of IIoT devices and Gateway Inventory
    of the things at the SDN controller REST-based Intent interface for network-agnostic
    cloud applications Security at every layer Local data analytics at the Sensors,
    Actuators and Gateway 7.6.7.2 Healthcare This healthcare use case is an attempt
    to come up with usable, acceptable and sustainable IoT solution for assisted mobility
    through falls prevention leading to active and healthy ageing. Falls in older
    adults are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality and are an important
    class of preventable injuries. This use case specifically focuses on advanced
    fall prevention and management solution aimed at both senior citizens and adults
    with Mild Cognitive Impairment or mild Alzheimer’s disease and their (informal)
    caregivers. The objective of this scenario is to extend the existing IoT platform
    like AREAS with Assisted Mobility Module (AMM) which is a dedicated module for
    the management of, and integration of information from, a network of IT services
    and hardware devices constituting an advanced fall prevention and management solution
    aimed at both senior citizens and adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment or mild
    Alzheimer’s disease and their (informal) caregivers. Given the figures introduced
    at the beginning, the social dimension of the solution is reflected in the improved
    quality of life for people that are susceptible to falls, given that AMM will
    prolong the time they can work and live independently. The envisaged evolution
    of the AMM will see the inclusion of additional robotic elements, in particular,
    the system will include a: Robotic Assistant (RA) connected to a network of embedded
    IoT devices and services for monitoring (and maintaining a diary of) a patient’s
    activities, health status and treatment, as well as for supporting cognitive skills
    training, notifying/reminding the patient of upcoming treatments (e.g. medication
    schedules) and visits. Personal assistant robots may help the patients with their
    daily activities like walking trail and other routine. SEMIoTICS will contribute
    in the: Integration of distributed IoT devices with higher degree of autonomy
    (i.e. robotic devices) Exploitation of computational resources both in the cloud
    and at the edge Security and privacy of patient data, safety of a patient 7.6.7.3
    Generic IoT & smart sensing Today’s IoT embedded devices are often described as
    smart devices. “Smart” usually shall be associated to some Things that show some
    form of intelligence, bright behaviour during their operations. Unfortunately,
    current meaning and their reality is that they are locally programmable and always
    connected to some cloud infrastructure (e.g. typically through a wireless connection
    such as Wi-Fi or Bluetooth Low Energy) to send raw data. Therefore, these devices
    transmit sensed data to the cloud without any analytic being performed locally
    and without showing remarkable forms of computational intelligence. An IoT thing
    is intelligent is it has capabilities to learn from and act upon the data (at
    least without supervision) it is sensing. Sometimes, they also receive back from
    the cloud some form of actuation (control) instructions, which are determined
    by a centralized server-based analysis of sensed and other data. A typical example,
    on domotic applications, is the one where several sensing nodes stream some relevant
    raw data at given interval (e.g. temperature, humidity, pressure) to a cloud service.
    An example is the Microsoft Azure or IBM Bluemix cloud platforms and related ecosystem.
    In this scenario, the intelligent data processing always resides remotely, and
    the communication channel is (implicitly) assumed to be always present and open.
    The use case provides: Evolution of platform technologies enabling local analytics
    computing (i.e. edge computing) Enhanced IoT system scalability and increased
    robustness Open market enhanced middleware portfolio for intelligent embedded
    devices and innovative businesses opportunities SEMIoTICS’s research efforts focus
    in the: Support for tight integration at device level of sensing and computational
    elements in close tight cooperation on dedicated embedded HW (i.e. edge computing)
    Increased system scalability and computational partitioning to enhance system
    responsiveness and stability by exploiting self-adapting online learning mechanisms
    Enhanced architectural models redefining system from bottom to top for handling
    the continuous and discrete sensing. 7.6.8 Summary SEMIoTICS aims to develop an
    open IIoT/IoT framework, interoperating with existing IIoT/IoT platforms (e.g.
    FIWARE, MindSphere) and programmable networking, through their exposed APIs. The
    SEMIoTICS framework will also integrate IIoT and IoT sensing and actuating technologies.
    A core element of the SEMIoTICS approach is the development and use of patterns
    for orchestration of smart objects and IoT platform enablers in IoT applications
    with guaranteed SPDI properties. Patterns constitute an architectural concept
    well founded in software systems engineering. SEMIoTICS advocates the patterns
    approach to systems engineering, but uses a novel pattern type (i.e., SPDI patterns)
    to guarantee semantic interoperability, security, privacy and dependability in
    large scale IIoT/IoT applications integrating smart objects. Said patterns will
    be supported by mechanisms featuring integrated and predictive monitoring of smart
    objects of all layers of the IoT implementation stack in a scalable manner, as
    well as core mechanisms for multi-layered embedded intelligence, IoT application
    adaptation, learning and evolution, and end-to-end security, privacy, accountability,
    and user control. This approach will enable and guarantee secure and dependable
    actuation and semi-autonomic behaviour in IoT/IIoT applications, supporting cross-layer
    intelligent dynamic adaptation, including heterogeneous smart objects, networks
    and clouds. 7.7 SerIoT The Internet of Things or Internet of Everything envisages
    billions of physical things or objects (sensors and actuators) connected to the
    Internet via heterogeneous access networks. IoT is emerging as the breakthrough
    technology introducing the next wave of innovations, including revolutionary applications,
    significantly improving and optimizing our daily life. The IoT is capable to create
    a complex Network of Networks system through IP protocol and Mobile Network connectivity,
    allowing “things” to be read, controlled and managed at any time and at any place.
    This brings such technical issues as the lack of a shared infrastructure, lack
    of common standards, problems with the flexibility, scalability, adaptability,
    maintenance, and updating the IoT devices, etc. Especially important are security
    concerns, resulting from all of the listed technological aspects [77, 78]. In
    case of lack of the IoT related security standards and commonly accepted technological
    solutions, every vendor creates their own solutions. Moreover, the solutions currently
    used in IT systems are mostly unsuitable for direct application in IoT, e.g. authentication
    based on central server that works well for small scale systems but does not provide
    sufficient mechanisms for future large scale IoT ecosystems. On the other hand,
    attacks on the IoT platforms will have significant economic, energetic and physical
    security consequences, beyond the traditional Internet lack of security. 7.7.1
    SerIoT Vision and Objectives SerIoT aims to conduct research for the delivery
    of a secure, open, scalable and trusted IoT architecture. The solution will be
    implemented and tested as a complete, generic solution to create and manage large
    scale IoT environment operating across IoT platforms and paying attention on security
    problems. A decentralized approach, based on peer to peer, overlay communication
    is proposed [69]. SerIoT will optimize the security of IoT platforms in a cross-layered
    manner. The concept of Software Defined Networks (SDN) is used and SDN controllers
    are organized in hierarchical structure [74, 75]. The objectives of SerIoT include
    to provide the prototype implementation of a self-cognitive [66–68], SDN based
    core network, easily configurable to adapt to any IoT platform, including advanced
    analytics modules, self-cognitive honeypots and secure routers. The solution will
    be supported by appropriate technologies such as Decision Support System (DSS)
    supplementing controller’s functionality. The DSS will be able to detect the potential
    threats and abnormalities. The system will be supplemented with comprehensive
    and intuitive visual analytics and mitigation strategies that will be used according
    to the detected threats. It will be validated in the final phase of the project
    through representative use cases scenarios, involving heterogeneous EU wide SerIoT
    network system. 7.7.2 SerIoT Architecture Concept The SerIoT architecture [65]
    is based on a software-managed network implementing SDN technology and is divided
    into the following layers and modules (See Figure 7.13.). Figure 7.13 The structure
    of layered SerIoT architecture. The IoT Data Acquisition layer is comprised of
    the low-level IoT-enabled components that create the infrastructure backbone,
    including honeypots, dedicated engines and storage capabilities and the SDN secure
    routers. The SDN routers will use OpenFlow communication and will be based on
    Open Switch implementation being significantly extended to cooperate with related
    SerIoT modules and security mechanism. The backbone network will be divided into
    domains (subnets). Every subnet constitutes an autonomic SDN network, controlled
    by the SDN controller and extended according to SerIoT needs. Controllers will
    be organized into hierarchical structure [76]. The first level controller is responsible
    for the routing within the subnet using gathered data. It will be also able to
    route packets to neighbouring subnets (via the appropriate border node). In the
    case of destinations outside their own subnet and neighbouring subnets, routing
    requests will be sent to a second (or third, fourth, etc.) level controllers.
    The controllers will continuously gather information to feed the analytics module.
    These components will be connected to visual analytics module and support decision
    making system. The Ad-hoc Anomaly detection layer will provide a number of security
    mechanisms, executed across IoT devices, honeypots and SDN routers. Anomaly detection
    techniques based on local traffic characteristics (as dynamic changes in queue
    lengths) will be regularly probed by smart “cognitive packets” sent by the SDN
    controller and feeding the controller routing decisions. The controller will have
    the ability to detect suspicious and risky paths, and re-schedule the routing
    paths over secure, preferable connections according to secure aware routing, but
    also energy and Qality of Service (QoS) aware routing [71–73]. The Visual Analytics
    and Decision Support tools will deal with the interactive decision support applications
    that will be delivered to the end-users, able to effectively detect potential
    abnormalities at different levels of the network. The end-user tool will be developed
    together with a novel visual analytics framework, dealing with the effective management
    and visualization of data. The Mitigation and Counteraction Module will be responsible
    for implementing decisions taken by the Decision Support tools. The module will
    use dedicated software and network components as SDN routers, honeypots and IoT
    devices. The SerIoT platform will ensure the separation of enterprise and private
    data. The system will provide monitoring mechanisms and anomaly detection techniques,
    using a cross-layer data collection infrastructure that will allow effective information
    transmission and data aggregation for analysis. A prototype honeypot with the
    ability to analyse network traffic and detecting anomalies will be developed.
    This new architecture for ensuring security, based on SDN technology, should bring
    a significant progress in comparison to current solutions. The innovatory approach
    used in SerIoT network will be using Cognitive Packets [70] for gathering network
    data on QoS, security state and energy usage, and Cognitive Packet Network routing
    engine, based on Random Neural Networks (RNN) [79, 80]. The concept is a combination
    of neural-networks-based routing and source routing. It was successfully applied
    in SDN network [71], and in the SerIoT project will be extended both in terms
    of data used as input for routing engine and of scale of the networks. Security
    data will be used as input for learning of RNN, along with QoS and energy usage
    data, to allow finding secure and efficient routes for every SDN flow. 7.7.3 Use
    Cases The solutions of the SerIoT project will be evaluated in individual laboratory
    test-beds and also in an integrated EU wide test-bed which will interconnect significant
    use cases developed by SerIoT industry partners. SerIoT aims to design and to
    deploy four innovative use cases arising from three significant for the global
    economy domains where the use of IoT is rapidly increasing: (i) Smart Cities domain
    will be covered by two ambitious use cases where Surveillance and Intelligent
    Transportation IoT networks will be evaluated, (ii) Flexible Manufacturing domain
    with the detection of physical attacks on wireless sensor networks, and finally
    (iii) a novel Food Chain Scenario will be exploited demonstrating mobility security
    issues. Each of the use cases considers one or several scenarios. A scenario is
    intended to describe and specify the system behaviour according to a specific
    situation, or in other words to describe the situation in which a specific system
    should work and how the system works and interacts with the different users: Use
    Case 1 (Surveillance) scenarios: Facilities monitoring Embedded intelligence in
    buses Use Case 2 (Intelligent Transport Systems ITS in Smart Cities) scenarios:
    Automated driving Public transport maintenance Public transport security Road
    side ITS stations Use Case 3 (Flexible Manufacturing Systems) scenarios: Wireless
    robots in warehouse Critical infrastructure protection Use Case 4 (Food Chain)
    scenario: Fresh food deadline control 7.7.4 Industrial and Commercial Involvement
    SerIoT has strong support regarding industrial know-how and implementation. Among
    the Consortium partners there are eight industrial or small/medium size enterprises
    (SME) with diverse and complementary technological and research expertise, covering
    the full spectrum of research and innovation activities anticipated in the project
    [65]. Six of these partners are large industrial societies able to support the
    multi-disciplinary topics introduced in SerIoT, i.e. IoT telecom/network infrastructure
    & Industry 4.0 Use Cases by DT/T-Sys, IoT anomaly detection by ATOS, IoT applications
    & platform by DT/T-Sys., design-driven & cross-layer analytics by ATOS. Moreover,
    SMEs involved in the consortium are among the leading and innovative companies
    in their sectors. Hence, a large amount of innovation foreseen in the project
    will be also carried by SMEs. What all SerIoT SME partners share in common is
    their proven ability to apply research results into successful and well established
    commercial products (e.g. HOP Core, Wear & Extended innovative solution by HOPU).
    Having in mind their strong commitment in delivering new services in their customers,
    industrial & SME partners have identified complementary private investments to
    support the SerIoT business perspectives. Moreover, specific dissemination actions
    will be carried out, through already established communication channels, networks
    and working groups in order to ensure that the new & open solutions of the project
    will be conveyed to major stakeholders in Europe and Worldwide. 7.7.5 Summary
    In this paper we outline the EU H2020 SerIoT project that addresses IoT security
    challenges. As a scientific project, SerIoT will provide a new approach to understand
    the threats to IoT based infrastructures and deliver methods to solve the security
    problems in the IoT. Pioneering research and development based on holistic approaches
    will be conducted. A generic IoT framework based on an adaptation of the concept
    of Software Defined Networks with Cognitive Packets will be developed as well
    as the new methods for intrusion detection with the use of a cross-layer approach.
    Visual analytics tools for analysing threats in IoT ecosystem will be used. 7.8
    SOFIE – Secure Open Federation for Internet Everywhere The main goal of the SOFIE
    [83] project is to enable diversified applications from various application areas
    to utilise heterogeneous IoT platforms and autonomous things across technological,
    organisational and administrative borders in an open and secure manner, making
    reuse of existing infrastructure and data easy. SOFIE is guided by the needs of
    three pilot use cases with diverse business requirements: food supply-chain, mixed
    reality mobile gaming, and energy markets. Furthermore, we will explore the synergies
    among these areas, building a foundation for cross-application-area use of existing
    IoT platforms and data. SOFIE will design, implement and pilot a systematic, open
    and secure way to establish new business platforms that utilise existing IoT platforms
    and distributed ledgers. With “openness”, we mean flexible and administratively
    open business platforms, as well as technically decentralised federation to enable
    the interoperability of different IoT platforms, ledgers, and autonomous devices.
    To realise this vision, SOFIE brings together large system vendors and integrators
    (ENGINEERING and Ericsson), high tech SMEs delivering highly innovative products
    and solutions (GuardTime, Synelixis) and prestigious universities (Aalto University
    and the Athens University of Economics and Business). The results of the project
    will be guided by these three use cases and will be tested in an equal number
    of real-life trials. For this purpose, the consortium includes ASM TERNI S.p.A.,
    a public multi-utility company and Emotion who will trial SOFIE developments in
    the energy sector, OPTIMUM, a leading SME in the area of supply chain IT systems,
    which (together with SYNELIXIS) will trial SOFIE in the realisation of a farm-to-fork
    scenario and Rovio Entertainment Corporation, which will lead the SOFIE trial
    in a mixed reality mobile gaming context. 7.8.1 Objectives The SOFIE consortium
    has broken down the high-level goal into the following specific and tangible objectives:
    Define a secure, open, decentralised and scalable IoT federation architecture
    for sensing, actuation, and smart behaviour. In order to stay open and interoperable,
    emerging standard interfaces should be used between the components and towards
    the outside world. Make IoT data and actuation accessible across applications
    and platforms in a secure and controlled way. SOFIE must provide the means to
    reuse data, within the limits set by its owner, across applications. Develop a
    solution to provide integrity, confidentiality and auditability of IoT data, events
    and actions. SOFIE shall define and implement ledger-independent transactions
    that can be simultaneously entered into various closed and open blockchains and
    other persistent ledgers. Develop an IoT federation framework to facilitate creation
    of IoT business platforms. The framework can be used to create business platforms,
    including those for the three pilot use cases. Deploy and evaluate the SOFIE federation
    framework in three field trials. Evaluate the commercial viability of the SOFIE
    federation approach based on the three field trials and research on business models.
    Establish the SOFIE IoT federation approach as a major enabler for the IoT industry
    through dissemination, standardization, education, workshops and pilots. 7.8.2
    Technical Approach SOFIE combines several IoT platforms and distributed ledgers
    into a federated IoT platform supporting the reuse of existing IoT infrastructure
    and data by various applications and businesses. Figure 7.14 illustrates the overall
    architectural approach. Figure 7.14 SOFIE Secure and Open Federation Architecture.
    SOFIE achieves decentralization of business platforms through the use of DLTs.
    Since the properties of various DLTs, such as scalability, throughput, resilience,
    and openness, are significantly different, SOFIE relies on using multiple different
    DLTs in parallel. To allow transactions to be recorded into multiple blockchains
    or other ledgers, SOFIE will design and implement the inter-ledger transaction
    layer. We will build upon existing leading-edge work, including the W3C-associated
    Inter-ledger Protocol (ILP), applying the results to the IoT domain, and developing
    them further. The transactions will be implemented as multi-stage smart contracts
    whose resolution depends on the transactions being correctly recorded in all the
    participating ledgers, but without requiring that all the ledgers support smart
    contracts. The inter-ledger transaction layer will be used for three main purposes:
    Describe the (“things”) data in the existing IoT platforms, enabling financially
    tied IoT actuation between organisations and storing security-related data. Enable
    secure and traceable IoT actuation. The idea is to negotiate and use smart contracts
    that may span multiple ledgers to record intention or desire to actuate, to trigger
    actuation, to permanently record both actuation instances and the related sensor
    values, and to trigger any financial transactions, thereby supporting smart behaviour.
    Enable interoperability between diverse existing IoT platforms. This is achieved
    by augmenting the existing IoT platforms with a federation adapter. These together
    allow applications to: discover what data and things are available in the IoT
    platforms; acquire the necessary permissions for access (e.g. by promising to
    pay or placing a pledge); access the data and/or request actuation in a secure,
    recorded, and compensated manner; and verify whether the requested actuation took
    place or not. Beneath the inter-ledger transaction layer are distributed ledgers.
    These include commonly used blockchains such as Ethereum, and private commercial
    blockchains such as KSI Blockchain developed by SOFIE partner Guardtime [81].
    The SOFIE federation approach is designed to be technology-agnostic, allowing
    systems with different APIs and data formats to interoperate to the extent allowed
    by the applicable security policies. Some of the existing IoT platforms already
    support interoperability across different protocols and standards. Examples of
    this include FIWARE through its IoT adapters [84], such as the already existing
    LWM2M and oneM2M adapters, and W3C WoT, where the IoT servient concept supports
    both proprietary APIs and various protocol adapters. While most of the data will
    reside within existing IoT systems, a key aspect of SOFIE is the so-called smart
    contract, available in some blockchains, such as Ethereum. From the SOFIE point
    of view, a smart contract is simply a computer program and its associated computational
    state that “lives” in a blockchain. 7.8.3 Security Architecture The SOFIE security
    architecture provides end-to-end security (confidentiality and integrity), identification,
    authentication and authorization, and supports users’ privacy and control over
    their data. Most existing solutions already provide decent end-to-end security
    within the system and system-specific authentication. Therefore, SOFIE concentrates
    on innovating in the areas of data sovereignty, privacy and federated key management,
    authentication, and authorization. IoT data can often be personal and therefore
    governed by a new EU’s GDPR legislation. Ensuring compliance with the GDPR is
    a major design requirement for the SOFIE security architecture. SOFIE plans to
    use MyData [85] together with Sovrin Foundation identity blockchain [86] to allow
    individuals to better control how their personal data is used. In order to support
    data sovereignty and privacy, SOFIE adopts a three-level approach to the storage
    of data. First, there is a private data store managed entirely by the stakeholder.
    A private blockchain (such as Guardtime’s KSI Blockchain) forms the second level
    data that is shared between collaborating stakeholders (for examples producer,
    reseller, and supermarket in the food chain use case). Finally, some data (such
    as hashes of transaction trees from the lower level) will be stored in a public
    blockchain, such as Ethereum or Bitcoin. Such an approach allows fine grained
    control of the data, from total openness (e.g. to bring transparency to certain
    public services) to very tight access control (e.g. to protect trade secrets or
    the privacy of people). In either case, integrity and non-repudiation of the data
    is guaranteed. 7.8.4 Use Cases The SOFIE approach will be tested in three different
    use cases described below. The food chain pilot aspires to demonstrate the field-to-fork
    scenario towards security in food production and consumption. SOFIE applications
    and realization of a community-supported heterogeneous end-to-end agricultural
    food chain will be demonstrated and evaluated. The use case will combine multiple
    types of ground, micro-climate, soil, leaf and other information stations, existing
    IoT platforms, mobility, location-based services (LBS), food tracking information,
    smart micro-contracts, and decentralized autonomous organizations implemented
    with smart contracts. The consumer may trace the entire history of the product
    based on the QR or RFID tag on the package, even in the shop before buying the
    product. Consumers can reliably verify not only the farmer from whom the product
    originates, but also the entire production and supply chain history associated
    with each food item, starting from the source of the seeds, the quality of the
    soil and the air in the producer’s premises, the amount of water that has been
    consumed, the fertilization process, the method and time of growing, the weather
    conditions, the transportation mode and distance, the storage conditions etc.
    This gives consumers the ability to make decisions about their food based on health
    and ethical concerns, including environmental sustainability, fair labour practices,
    the use of fertilizers and pesticides, and other similar issues. In the Mixed
    Reality Mobile Gaming Pilot, virtual and real worlds will be combined. Mobile
    gaming is a rapidly growing market, popular games, such as Pokémon Go, are already
    taking advantage of augmented reality and SOFIE aims to take such interaction
    further. SOFIE will integrate a mobile game with the real world using a federated
    IoT platform aiming to: a) enable the gamers to interact with the real world via
    sensors and actuators, b) take advantage of existing and emerging IoT infrastructure
    (e.g. building automation), c) enable payments in virtual and real currencies
    between the gamers, games, and other parties, and d) create new business opportunities
    for various parties, including gaming companies, as well as the owners of buildings
    and public spaces (e.g. malls) and various businesses (e.g. shops and cafés).
    The gamers will be both moving in the physical world and interacting with it through
    the games. Existing IoT infrastructure, for instance movement sensors and control
    of lighting and passage, will be included in the game world through the federated
    SOFIE platform. Owners of spaces and businesses will be able to bring their existing
    or new IoT infrastructure into the gaming world, while the blockchain-based marketplace
    will allow for all kinds of business models, including In-Game Assets (IGA) trading.
    The energy pilot aims at optimized Demand Response and at supporting electricity
    marketplaces and micropayments. The energy pilot consists of two parts: first,
    a real-field pilot will demonstrate the capability of creating smart micro-contracts
    and micro-payments in a fully distributed energy marketplace, located in Terni,
    Italy. The pilot will cover the end-to-end scenario form electricity production,
    distribution, storage and consumption. During the scenario electricity produced
    by renewable sources (PVs) will be fed into the low voltage (LV) electricity network.
    Most of this electricity will be normally consumed by energy customers (i.e. houses,
    offices, etc). However, the surplus of the generated power would generate reverse
    power flows through the LV distribution network substation. The electricity distribution
    network is designed to handle only unidirectional electricity flows, thus reverse
    flows may generate significant problems. To avoid this abnormal operation, electrical
    vehicles (EVs) will be offered significant promotional benefits to match their
    EV charging needs with the network time and space balancing requirements. The
    EV chargers will be communicating with the EV drivers, with the car battery management
    system, the local energy generation and consumption, and the smart meters to predict
    if the requested charging service/network grid stabilization will be available
    in due time. Second, a laboratory and interoperability pilot based on real-data
    from smart energy meters deployed in the greater area of Tallinn, Estonia. The
    trial will be based on the Estfeed open software platform [87] for energy consumption
    monitoring and management from the customer (consumers/prosumers) side, which
    is capable of interacting with the power network and to provide data feeds for
    efficient use of energy. Figure 7.15 Three SOFIE pilots. To assess cross-SOFIE
    interoperability, SOFIE pilots will be federated as shown in Figure 7.15. In the
    cross-pilot, the emphasis will be on the demonstration of the exploitation of
    data stored/cached in different locations to be accessed across different platforms,
    as well as the development of applications exploiting different underlying infrastructures.
    The SOFIE interfaces abstraction will allow virtual entities in one platform to
    be exploited by applications from a different platform, while data semantics and
    analytics will facilitate the data exploitation. Initial consideration of scenarios
    to be tested include: Energy and gaming pilots exploiting data protection/privacy
    (e.g., for building access), energy pilots (EV) exploiting smart agriculture data
    with respect to environmental conditions and payments and contracts across pilots
    (e.g., getting food discounts from gaming achievements). 7.8.5 Conclusions The
    SOFIE federation approach will help make the existing siloed IoT platforms interoperable,
    enabling cross-platform applications and reuse of data in a secure and scalable
    manner. SOFIE will offer data sovereignty in GDPR-compliant way, giving users
    more control of their data. Through the usage of distributed ledgers, SOFIE will
    promote open business platforms, allowing creation of new kinds of decentralised
    open marketplaces, which no single entity – public or private – can technically
    control and thus exercise sole pricing power over them. This in turn will lower
    the barrier of entry for small businesses and individuals. The SOFIE federation
    framework will be released as open-source and SOFIE partners have the capacity
    to deliver and boost the penetration of SOFIE offerings in the market and relevant
    standardization bodies. List of Notations and Abbreviations Notations Abbreviations

    Spain Abstract This chapter describes the background and origin of the artistic
    series CREATE Your IoT. The series is a very special one as it is being created
    and hosted at the heart of the Large-Scale Pilots Programme of the European Union
    (LSPs). The series puts artworks at the core and makes them the motive for dialogue
    between all actual and potential stakeholders in use-cases of the LSPs aiming
    at pointing out ways of how other innovative actions can be implemented on top
    of the developments made available by LSPs. The text looks at how art and technology
    are intrinsically related, how art practices historically expanded their field
    of action to make the world and life a canvas and how more recently the influence
    of artistic ideas in the creation of new products, services and processes is irrevocable.
    More specific examples of this connection between technology and the arts in the
    field of ICT and IoT are presented. Finally, an updated report on ongoing artistic
    actions in the context of the CREATE IoT coordination and support action are presented.
    8.1 Introduction Technologies and the arts have always been closely related. Indeed,
    this relationship is invoked with every mention of the word technology, which
    has its origins in the Ancient Greek tékhnē, meaning art. In this project, we
    will explore the contemporary relationship between technology and the arts, reflecting
    on how they can influence each other and the conditions under which their synergies
    can flourish. New technologies have shaped artistic practices since the dawn of
    history. Demand for tools to accomplish specific tasks has compelled technology
    to develop in new directions. Potentially, the first tool one can conceive Homo
    erectus to have created, after winning the fight between the weight of their brain
    and gravity, was the invention of the stick – to more easily pick fruit from trees.
    The stick as an extension of the arm. The paint brush as an extension of the stick
    – an artistically driven technological innovation – is naturally conceivable as
    well. More recently, Andy Clark and David Chalmers conceived the iPhone as an
    extension of the mind [1]. Understanding Steve Jobs as the most contemporary artist
    of the past century then becomes key to pursuing the transformations of the timeless
    intertwining between technologies and the arts. “The ability to produce art was
    an indication that humans had begun to think in more abstract terms. It’s a thought
    process that enabled us to come up with the science and technology that enabled
    our species to become so successful.” —BBC article by Pallab Gosh, Oct. 2014 [2]
    This quote comes from BBC Science correspondent Pallab Gosh, who was reporting
    on recent discoveries in a rural area on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, where
    cave art from 40,000 years ago was found. The discoveries are the first of their
    kind outside the European continent, thus putting into question the positioning
    of Europe, and Western culture for that matter, as pioneering human development
    [3]. “The emergence of art marks the beginning of a surge in the development of
    human intelligence. The people who produce art are able to reflect their thoughts
    in the form of pictures and symbols”, reports Gosh. Indeed, the ability to transform
    “abstract knowledge” into “knowledge of perception” is a unique characteristic
    of human intelligence. This ability fulfils the human need for making sense of
    what happens/happened by creating narratives. There is also a need to freeze moments
    in time: the need for creating images one can grasp and hold on to, the need for
    making sense of life, the need for giving meaning to life – meaningfulness. The
    attribution of meaning to technologies is a relevant aspect for understanding
    the intertwining of technologies and the arts. For example, the invention of photography
    in the 19th century is possibly the event that had the most impact in the course
    of the history of art. On the one hand, it liberated painters from the duty of
    portraying personalities and started a movement of abstraction in painting that
    gave origin to great diversity of styles in the 20th century. On the other hand,
    it created a new tool for expression that is nowadays one of the most established
    forms of artistic expression. In sum, new meanings were attributed to the technique
    of painting and to a new technology – photography – which lead to new forms of
    images with its associated novel techniques. For instance, Pointillism can be
    interpreted as the first step towards a digital format of images, similar to what
    we nowadays call pixels. 8.2 CREATE Your IoT Artistic practices are thinking processes
    as well as they generate reproducible knowledge. The peculiarity of the knowledge
    generated by the arts using technology is that by reverse engineering the final
    products of those creations, one can fully understand its functionality. One of
    the characteristics of the practice of art is that artists act first and rationalize
    later. The actual context of the relationship between ICT and art allows for an
    unprecedented integration of subjectivity in the context of technological research.
    8.2.1 The Practice of Art as a Thinking Process Urgency is a condition sine qua
    non in the attribution of the artistic quality to a practice. For a practice to
    be considered as artistic, it has to originate in that primordial urgency. Karl
    Phillip Moritz (1756–1793), in his writings Artistic Imitation of the Beautiful,
    defined this urgency or artistic impetus as drive and not as idea, concept or
    a representation [4]. This reverses the Leibniz–Wolffian hierarchy of human faculties
    by valuing the artistic, by considering the irrational and subconscious as the
    true source of human agency. Philosophers such as Schopenhauer, Nietzsche and
    others support that culture initiated by Moritz in which the “dark and undefined”
    balances with and is as relevant as the “clear and distinct” [5]. According to
    Landgraf, Moritz sees urgency as being about the productivity of nature that serves
    as media. It links the artist and the artwork as well as driving the creative
    process. Artistic creativity allows for the mediation between an undefined non-representational
    stimulus, i.e. realisation, and the artistic objectification or communication
    of the stimulus, i.e. manifestation. Artistic is that which is created by an artistic
    practice, and that distinguishes it from any other knowledge generation practice,
    such as scientific practice. The core of artistic practice is the urgency for
    creation, composed of two poles: realisation and manifestation. They are the indivisible
    components of artistic urgency. Realisation is the need to make things happen
    while manifestation is the need to create beings. Realisation is the core of practice
    itself. It is the action of making. It is movement, the energy of exteriorization.
    It is embodying in an outward form. Manifestation is the core of creation. It
    is openness to revelation. It is recognising a being, the energy of interiorization.
    It is embodying in an inward form. The Portuguese poet, Helder, expresses an extraordinary
    image of Manifestation: I now dive and ascend as a glass. I bring up that image
    of internal water. Poem pen dissolved in the primordial direction of the poem.
    Or the poem going up the pen, passing through its own impulse, poem returning.
    Extract from Sumula (sum and substance), by Herberto Helder translated by Luis
    Miguel Girao (not published). Herberto Helder (1930–2015), in the excerpt above,
    describes the bipolar coexistence of Realisation and Manifestation with a special
    focus on the latter. He describes the inwards embodiment of the pen by a poem.
    The “primordial direction of the poem” is towards the pen and the poet himself.
    “The poem going up the pen, passing through its own impulse” represents the impulsive
    nature of the need of making of the poet, Realisation. By “passing through its
    own impulse”, the poem embodies the pen and reveals itself to the poem which,
    in turn, writes it on the paper. Manifestation nurtures Realisation, which in
    turn nurtures Manifestation, in a non-starting and non-ending cycle of urgency.
    Helder understands the artwork, the poem, as a being. The poem has its own life
    and manifests itself through the poet, the pen and the paper: “poem returning”.
    The return of the poem is the process of Manifestation that, however, is dependent
    on the poet’s need for objectification: Realisation, his need to make things happen,
    in order to materialise as a form. In a particular way, Helder expresses how “Nietzsche
    saw thinking itself: as a dance of concepts and the pen”, as pointed out by Roy
    Ascott (1934–) in Telematic Embrace [6], when describing telematic networks as
    a “planetary field for the dance of data”. Telematics, as envisioned by Ascott,
    allows for the disappearance of “senders” and “receivers”, so that they all become
    “users”, creative participants. He established the concept of “distributed authorship”
    in digital networks following up on the ideas of Barthes’ “dispersed authorship”
    in his Le Plaisir du Text [7] and Derrida’s free play of sense. Seconding the
    notion of thinking of culture as started by Moritz and followed by Nietzsche is
    Agostinho da Silva (1906–1994). In one episode of the TV series Conversas Vadias,
    broadcast by the Portuguese national broadcaster, RTP, between 8th March and 31st
    May 1990, the Portuguese philosopher stated: We could carry on our shoulders a
    machine that thinks, or rather a machine that detects ideas that roam around the
    world. —Agostinho da Silva, 1990. [1] [1] https://arquivos.rtp.pt/conteudos/conversa-com-baptista-bastos/
    from minute 22 onwards. (last accessed on 13/08/2017) Translated by Luis Miguel
    Girao. This statement by da Silva is not an affirmation, but rather a proclamation
    of doubt. It was made after the interviewer, the writer Armando Baptista-Bastos
    (1933–2017), asked Professor da Silva why he normally advised his students not
    to think. His answer was the above quoted proclamation of doubt. According to
    da Silva, “we still don’t know” whether we produce thoughts or whether thoughts
    come to our minds. In case of doubt, his choice was not to think. Da Silva, in
    a communicative way aimed at addressing the masses, pointed out, as Morris did,
    that ‘detecting ideas’ is also valid for the generation of knowledge. He was trying
    to bring to the general public a discussion that has been going on for centuries
    about noumena and phenomena. One of the high points of the discussion about noumena
    and phenomena is the critique by Arthur Schopenhauer (1788–1860) of Immanuel Kant’s
    (1724–1804) use of the word noumena: But it was just this distinction between
    abstract knowledge and knowledge of perception, entirely overlooked by Kant, which
    the ancient philosophers denoted by noumena and phenomena. (See Sextus Empiricus,
    Outlines of Pyrrhonism, Book I, Chapter 13, ‘What is thought (noumena) is opposed
    to what appears or is perceived (phenomena).’) This contrast and utter disproportion
    greatly occupied these philosophers in the philosophemes of the Eleatics, in Plato’s
    doctrine of the Ideas, in the dialectic of the Megarics, and later the scholastics
    in the dispute between nominalism and realism, whose seed, so late in developing,
    was already contained in the opposite mental tendencies of Plato and Aristotle.
    But Kant who, in an unwarrantable manner, entirely neglected the thing for the
    expression of which those words phenomena and noumena had already been taken,
    now takes possession of the words, as if they were still unclaimed, in order to
    denote by them his things-in-themselves and his phenomena” [8]. Schopenhauer again
    makes a clear distinction between “what is thought” and “what appears or is perceived”.
    This distinction has been fundamental to the discussion on the practice of art
    as a thinking process and its potential contributions for knowledge-generation
    systems [2]. It is relevant to understand and recognise the opposed concepts of
    noumena and phenomena in order to understand the uniqueness of the practice of
    art in making both concepts coexist simultaneously, as expressed above in the
    definition of artistic urgency. [2] Knowledge-generation systems refer to organisms
    that bring together contributions from different fields of study to research a
    specific subject. The overall vision is that the integration of the practice of
    art in these interdisciplinary, multidisciplinary or transdisciplinary groups
    of researchers is crucial for the development of research. www.starts.eu (last
    accessed on 14/08/2017). Robert Pepperell, author of Post Human Condition [9],
    has resumed the discussion on noumena and phenomena by proposing the concept of
    phenoumenon. The notion of phenoumenon as the basic assumption for understanding
    the practice of art as a thinking process that “includes (all) our thoughts about
    reality which are part of a continuous phenoumenon” [10]. The great contribution
    of the practice of art for the generation of knowledge is transforming noumena
    into phenomena through Realisation and Manifestation by being both simultaneously:
    a phenoumenon. In other words, art is simultaneously embodying inwards and outwards.
    This means transforming “abstract knowledge” into “knowledge of perception” by
    producing technology-based artworks whose reasoning can be reversed. That is,
    making things happen and creating beings. 8.2.2 Art is Life (Integration) “Art
    is Life, Life is Art” —Wolf Vostell (1932–1998) Vostell was a German painter and
    sculptor and is considered a pioneer of happening and Fluxus. Fluxus was an international
    and interdisciplinary group of artists that, in the late 1960s, produced performance
    “events”, happenings, including concrete poetry, visual art, urban planning, architecture,
    design, literature and publishing. Fluxus has sometimes been described as intermedia,
    a category into which composers such as Niblock fall. The ideas and practices
    of John Cage influenced Fluxus, especially his understanding of the work as a
    site of interaction between artist and audience [11]. For Vostell, a human’s physical
    action, the handling of things, was already considered art. What happens, the
    happening, is already art only if one wants it to be and one affirms it. Artworks
    no longer need an envelope or frame. Art steps out of its frame, normally the
    gallery, and melts immediately into the stream of life. The dilution of the boundaries
    between daily life and the places determined for art was one of the main objectives
    of the Fluxus movement. This was partially achieved, especially at the beginning
    of the movement. Yet, arguably, the institutionalisation of art has been unavoidable,
    and it naturally took advantage of this sort of movement to expand its area of
    action. Nonetheless, nowadays we can experience very interesting forms of art
    practice, such as street theatre, viral theatre, pop-rock bands and performances,
    and even some fashion industry-related events, happenings or products such as
    flashmobs, which somehow integrate art in daily life contexts. One of the most
    common Fluxus happenings is the hammering of a piano as symbol of the destruction
    of the institutionalisation of the arts. This thesis builds upon a further development
    of this act, which is the destruction of desktop or laptop computers, as a symbol
    of the institutionalization of digital technologies. It is also the expression
    of the idea that ubiquity, in the form of the Internet of Things, amongst others,
    could allow the spread of artistic ideas, works or concepts embedded in new technologies
    themselves. Such a movement would allow for a worldwide dissemination of artistic
    ideas impregnated in society and economy via technological innovation. This idea
    is further developed in artistic interventions in the European Commission STARTS
    Initiative and the Internet of Things Large-Scale Pilots. Those interventions
    are an expansion of some activities already happening in the field of arts and
    ubiquity. In that context, it has become common practice to organise workshops
    in which ideas to be congregated in public participation are developed. Contextualising
    digital practices within architectural spaces and exploring the opportunities
    of experiencing and perceiving domestic environments with the use of media and
    computing technologies have been used as methods for the design of reflexive and
    intimate interiors that provide informational, communicational, affective, emotional
    and supportive properties according to embedded sensorial interfaces and processing
    systems. To properly investigate these concepts, a fundamental criterion is magnified
    and dissected: dwelling, as an important ingredient in this relationship entails
    the magical power to merge physical environment with the psyche of inhabitants.
    For this reason, a number of views providing necessary conditions to include matters
    of affectivity, ubiquity and layering complexity of interior space have been highlighted
    [12]. Integrative art is the integration of artistic practice into daily life.
    The way it is envisaged in this chapter is through the technology described above.
    Nowadays, integrative art is not a common practice amongst artists in the sense
    that is envisaged here. However, some relevant examples are emerging. An example
    of artistic critical approach in IoT is the work of artist James Brindle who is
    trying to build his own self-driving car and published all the code developed
    in pursuit of the DIY self-driving car [3]. Brindle says: [3] https://github.com/stml/austeer
    “Self-driving cars bring together a bunch of really interesting technologies –
    such as machine vision and intelligence – with crucial social issues such as the
    atomization and changing nature of labour, the shift of power to corporate elites
    and Silicon Valley, and the quasi-religious faith in computation as the only framework
    for the production of truth-and hence, ethics and social justice.(…) The attempt
    to build my own car is a process of understanding how the dominant narratives
    of these technologies are produced, and could be changed.” 8.2.3 ICT and Art Golan
    Levin, one of the most prominent individuals of the emerging field of ICT and
    art, very clearly demonstrated how artistic projects presented ICT solutions well
    before they became known: Figure 8.1 Myron Krueger’s Video Place (1974), and the
    Sony EyeToy (2003). Figure 8.2 Michael Naimark & MIT ArchMac’s Aspen Movie Map
    (1978–1980), and Google Street View (2007–). Figure 8.3 Jeffrey Shaw’s Legible
    City (1988) and E-fitzone exercise equipment (2008). Figure 8.4 Art+Com’s Terravision
    (1996) and Google’s Google Earth (2001, 2005–). The artist and technologist states
    that he wrote his article New Media Artworks: Prequels to Everyday Life, [4] as
    consequence of the following: [4] http://www.flong.com/blog/2009/new-media-artworks-prequels-to-everyday-life/
    “I struggled to justify the value of new-media arts research to an audience of
    Silicon Valley business people; while simultaneously, some new-media artist friends
    of mine discovered that their work had been ‘appropriated’ by a large corporation.”
    This example reveals one of the most important gaps in the generation of new businesses
    models in global markets: the one existing between creativity and business. The
    US, moreover, is home of crucial players in the field, such as the most relevant
    academic publisher in the field, Leonardo, and SEAD, the network for Sciences,
    Engineering, Arts and Design. However, the European context nurtures the development
    of institutions such as Ars Electronica that distinguished Golan Levin with its
    Prix; the same institution also distinguished Linus Torvalds, considering the
    collective process that led to Linux as an artistic expression. It is this same
    European context that recognized the emergence of ICT & ART so as to allow for
    the worldwide establishment of STARTS, the European Commission initiative in Science,
    Technology and the Arts, as a recognized field of Research and Technological Development.
    A considerable number of organisations, institutions and programmes promoting
    activities linking ICT and art proliferate in the European Union. Some of these
    institutions are worldwide leaders such as Ars Electronica (AT), ZKM (DE) or IRCAM
    (FR), to name but a few. However, it is from small organisations and individuals
    that the most innovative projects or actions originate. As an example, the Finnish
    artistic/researcher Laura Beloff, who has been operating as an individual focused
    on the development of wearable technologies, has recently been appointed the Head
    of Section–Interaction Design and Computer Game Development at IT University in
    Copenhagen, Denmark. The Finnish Bioart Society that she founded and directs was
    one of the participants of a workshop on bioart, promoted by the FBI in California,
    USA. Laura is one of many artists that are becoming institutionally prominent
    not in the field of the arts but in the field of ICT. Small organisations seem
    in fact to be the strategic focus of promoters, as funding in the field is mostly
    directed more to groups of people than to individuals. Medialab-Prado (ES), Kitchen
    Budapest (HU), F.A.C.T. (GB), Pervasive Media (UK), iDAT (UK), iMAL (BE) and CIANT
    (CZ) seem to be good examples of organizations promoting more relevant activities.
    More and more ideas of collaboration, co-creation, shared knowledge and participation
    are present in their initiatives. The concept of lab, from OpenLab, to FabLab
    and Living Lab, has been instrumental in the diffusion of techniques of digital
    fabrication and physical prototyping, allowing everybody to go, learn and create.
    From pieces of 3D printing to lines of code for multimedia installations, activities
    linking ICT and art seem to follow a model of establishing an artistic context
    for creative participation, be it in the form of interactive installations or
    workshops to learn how to make or to create. It seems that we are moving from
    models of engaging the arts to illustrate and communicate science, such as the
    one implemented at CERN, to the ideas of living labs, such as the iMinds’ own
    iLab.o or Barcelona Laboratori Cultural, promoted by Josep Perelló, who was previously
    responsible for the Science Area on behalf of the University of Barcelona at Arts
    Santa Mònica centre in Barcelona (SP). There are already a considerable number
    of small and medium businesses developing around these activities, such as Libelium
    (ES). The concept of providing creative learning platforms as a new business model
    is actually expanding as a strategy. What started as an artistic project is becoming
    the standard for rapid prototyping in physical computing: Arduino (IT). This development
    platform created and has been maintaining a large community of developers around
    itself, based on the establishment of an easy-to-use programming language, a playful
    set of online tutorials and an active online form. The same model has been applied
    in Processing or openFrameworks. The community started with a majority of artists
    and expanded to become of a majority of technologists. Almost every electronics
    store in big European cities sells Arduino and related products. The expansion
    of this model is becoming visible in big companies such as Farnell and its community
    platform Element 14 or the DIGI. Also, in this last case, the new XBee project
    gallery is a result of the collaboration of Rob Faludi (US) with the electronics
    corporation. At the University of Cambridge’s Computer Laboratory (GB), what is
    becoming the next platform for development was created: The Raspberry Pi. In education,
    the most interesting model seems to be related to the concepts of ubiquity and
    the internet of things. i-DAT24 of the University of Plymouth (UK) has been promoting
    exemplary initiatives such as the Confluence Project: a group of students of schools
    located at North Devon’s UNESCO Biosphere Reserve, in collaboration with artists
    and technologists, developed and implemented remote wireless networks from which
    they created online data visualisations. In research, the most relevant worldwide
    network of researchers in the field of Art, Science, Technology and Consciousness
    Studies is the Planetary Collegium. The network has nodes in Lucerne, Trento and
    Shanghai. The main hub is at the University of Plymouth. A considerable number
    of conferences on the crossings of ICT and arts happen all over the world, the
    most relevant being, for example, ISEA, Ars Electronica, Siggraph, HCI International
    and Transmediale. At the level of social innovation, the growing intersection
    between the application of ICT and art in the field of disability is notable.
    The Artabilitation (DK) group has been joining a relevant number of researchers
    in this area, including the exemplary case of Rolf Gehlhaar. Gehlhaar developed
    a number of digital interfaces for musical expression, some of them recently integrated
    into the British Paraorchestra. The orchestra opened the Queen’s Christmas Speech
    of 2012 and played at the Paralympics closing ceremony in London, in 2012. The
    European Commission has been supporting a number of projects engaging the arts
    as described in the call for tender. However, the most relevant recent activities
    come from DG CONNECT which promoted the ICT ART CONNECT workshops and related
    events, which have been dedicated to better understanding how to integrate the
    arts with ICT. The COST Arts and Technologies Event took place in Zagreb, from
    the 25th to the 28th of November 2013. The COST Arts & Technologies (CAT) workshop
    assumes that there are large potential gains in integrating arts on the one hand
    with technologies on the other, to a larger extent than has been done so far.
    Combining artistic creativity with technological expertise should in itself have
    a great potential to lead to new products, services and social innovations. The
    workshop aimed at enabling innovative integration of arts and multi-, inter-,
    and transmedia technologies and their actual and potential integration with industries
    and society as a way of enhancing competitiveness and creativeness of European
    innovation in arts and technologies. [5] [5] http://www.cost.eu/events/cat The
    CAT workshop gave rise to a relevant collective white paper entitled Organisms
    for Change and Transformation. [6] [6] http://www.cost.eu/download/47808 DG CONNECT
    of the European Commission has been promoting key initiatives in the context of
    the Digital Single Market (DSM), under the umbrella of the STARTS Initiative.
    However, bearing in mind long-term targets such as 2050, it will be in the context
    of the now developing Framework Programme Horizon Europe of the European Commission
    that further development of STARTS will have to develop. In order to find conditions
    for the nurture of these future activities, areas of opportunity need to be found
    within this context. The present understanding seems that regional development
    will be instrumental. The reason behind this assumption is that the regions of
    Europe strategically dedicated to this area of innovative development will be
    determined to a large extent by this programme. The context of the Cultural and
    Creative Industries (CCIs) seems to be the ideal host for the ideas forthcoming
    from the potential research results from the future of STARTS. Nonetheless, it
    seems that the focus of this emerging field should probably not lie in the utilization
    of ICT for digital content, cultural industries and creativity. The utilization
    of the arts as a means to communicate aspects of science on its own also does
    not seem to be innovative enough for the purposes of the emerging field in question:
    this practice has emerged and spread worldwide, as these activities have been
    happening worldwide since the last century and are already quite established as
    described. The engagement of the arts with ICT are also instrumental in allowing
    the active participation of a large number of European citizens to create and
    live their own lives in a better way. Protocols such as Open Data and Open Source
    allow for digitally mediated forms of social innovation both at the level of opinion-making
    participation as well as at the level of self-employment. From this perspective,
    the creation and establishment of new business models and entrepreneurship becomes
    an active form of social innovation. This implies nurturing not only the visionary
    and exploratory characteristics of artistic practices, but also furthering their
    wider capability of research and development. These ideas are clearly aligned
    with actual objectives such as Inclusive Societies by which “The European cities
    have to be at the heart of policies aiming to create growth, jobs and a sustainable
    future” and “the increasing socio-economic importance of digital inclusion, research
    and large-scale innovation actions will promote inclusive ICT solutions and the
    effective acquisition of digital skills leading to the empowerment of citizens
    and a competitive workforce.” In her report on H2020, MEP Maria da Graça Carvalho
    proposes “education and science, arts and humanities as fundamental drivers of
    social and economic progress and well-being”. Social innovation generates new
    goods, services, processes and models that meet societal needs and create new
    social relationships. It is important to understand how social innovation and
    creativity may lead to change in existing structures and policies and how they
    can be encouraged and scaled up. Grass-roots online and distributed platforms
    networking citizens and allowing them to collaborate and co-create solutions based
    on an extended awareness of the social, cultural, political and environmental
    context can be a powerful tool to support the objectives of Europe 2020. Moreover,
    aspects of participation are also at the core of the programme: “…address social-network
    dynamics and crowd-sourcing and smart-sourcing for co-production of solutions
    addressing social problems, based on open data sets. They will help to manage
    complex decision-making, in particular the handling and analysis of huge quantities
    of data for collaborative policy modelling, simulation of decision-making, visualisation
    techniques, process modelling and participatory systems (…) as well as to analyse
    changing relationships between citizens and the public sector. Increased levels
    of complexity, the implications of questions posed by technology, advanced computation,
    life sciences and bio-engineering impinge upon areas of knowledge traditionally
    related with human studies, such as philosophy, theology, and legal, political
    and economic thought should be addressed. It is important to combine art, science
    and entrepreneurship; new forms of urban expression; knowledge, art and entrepreneurialism
    related to the integration of multiculturalism and integration of migratory flows;
    multilingualism.” The same applies for creativity and innovation: “Exploring processes
    which provide a favourable background to creativity and innovation. Providing
    a better understanding of the social, cultural, economic and political context
    for innovation shall be a priority. In particular, the role of youth perception
    of the opportunities for innovation in the current economic environment of high
    unemployment in many EU regions shall be carefully understood in relation to education
    and to the risk of brain-drain.” Finally, cultural heritage and European identity
    are also important: “The aim is to contribute to an understanding of Europe’s
    intellectual basis […] European collections, including digital ones, […] should
    be made accessible through new and innovative technologies and integrated information
    services to researchers and citizens to enable a look to the future through the
    archive of the past and to contribute to the European participative intelligence.”
    In sum, an understanding of the crossroads of science, technology and the arts
    on all these levels is crucial to fostering post-crisis processes of recovery
    in the European Union. At the heart of the Fourth Industrial Revolution lies the
    outstanding feature of the automation of mechanisation. Artificially intelligent
    computerised machines liberate humans from mechanistic tasks in chain with machines.
    The actual concept of a hybrid system integrates humans into industrial chains
    where subjectivity is a need. In this general context, disciplinary specialisation
    in research is giving way to transversal and holistic approaches, with the assurance
    that intelligent machines are in place to perform highly precise and effective
    tasks. Humans are no longer needed to perform complex operations but instead,
    they become indispensable to trigger and correlate highly complex operations,
    where knowledge convened by subjective processes is crucial for the achievement
    of results. Research and development practices are no longer methodological processes
    of confirming expectations or hypothesis, but now become flexible processes of
    discovery due to the availability of easier means of experimentation and repetition.
    Sciences of cognition set a very good example of that expressed above. They often
    cross knowledge from different disciplines, they depend on high-tech imaging and
    measuring equipment and their results are mostly dependent on subjective reports.
    Therefore, they demand an articulation of many different disciplines and their
    experiments are led by enquiry on subjective aspects of perception. Already in
    this field of research, the integration of artistic practices is an emerging factor.
    Art practices are transdisciplinary by nature, independently of the channels of
    expression used. Throughout history artists have specialised in developing technologies
    and implementing techniques in the design of artistic experiences. Therefore,
    in the present context of experimental integration of subjectivity, artists are
    emerging as relevant contributors in research and development of technology. Technologies
    being a consequence of scientific developments, artistic practices become interesting
    experimental methods for the generation of new knowledge. Strategies are needed
    for the integration of these new ways of thinking amongst different scientific
    communities, leading to true social and economic innovation. Historically narrowing
    our perspective over more recent events, one can say that the existing collaborations
    among artists and scientists are a consequence of the work of Frank Malina. He
    was at the origin of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratories, of which he was the first
    director. In 1968, in Paris, as a way of pursuing his interest in kinetic art,
    he founded the Leonardo Journal, which is still the leading publication on the
    crossings of arts, sciences and technologies. His son, Roger Malina, continuing
    his father’s work, is one of the most prominent agents in the field, by running
    the Leonardo project as well as triggering other actions such as SEAD. SEAD is
    looking into congregating best practices of collaborations in science, engineering,
    arts and design. However, all actions in the field tend to make the old-fashioned
    model prevail, where every single actor of the collaborative system conserves
    and develops his or her own speciality, which of course enhances political aspects
    of real and productive collaboration. Their results are mostly limited to theoretical
    papers, and in cases that could result in practical applications, issues of generating
    economic value such as intellectual property generation and protection are generally
    dismissed. Not to mention how far these practices stay from aspects of creation
    of new products, services, and of the business aspects of generating new jobs
    and self-employment. Nurturing the expansion of fields of action of each discipline
    and solving conflicts resulting from their overlapping of functions are the instruments
    to achieve transdisciplinary. However, the main question still remains: How to
    integrate arts and sciences in truly productive ways, both in the direction of
    the generation of new philosophical knowledge, as well as in the direction of
    the creation of new technology-based businesses, in order to make the European
    Union the world leader of emerging markets and creating future ones? The adoption
    of artistic practices such as research methodologies is instrumental for the integration
    of subjectivity in the production of scientific, reproducible knowledge, allowing
    for a holistic approach, not only to the emergence of future sciences, but also
    of future technologies, leading to close-to-market results, especially concerning
    the intersection of the arts and information and communication technologies. Therefore,
    the main benefits of STARTS are in its features of nurturing socio-economic innovation
    by mediation of digital information and communication technologies. By promoting
    the intersection of scientific and artistic practices, inevitably leading to new
    methodologies and processes of generating new knowledge, STARTS aims to transform
    the way research and development communities face their own research targets:
    at one stage, to make them more open to novelty, exploration mechanisms, creativity
    and imagination; at another, to make them focus on concrete research outputs,
    in the form of close-to-market prototyping. The main targets of STARTS should
    be to disperse the idea that blue-sky, thinking-based research can generate added
    value, not just because of its inherent novelty, but because this novelty, by
    being tracked at intermediate states of development, will lead to new scientific
    and technological developments. Innovation at the social level where scientists
    and artists interact will lead to both new knowledge and new technologies, in
    accordance with actual demands of society and markets. In other words, STARTS
    aims to benefit European research communities by merging scientific and artistic
    research and innovation (R&I) practices into producing new philosophical knowledge
    and new technologies, as well as making R&I practitioners aware that having both
    of the above combined might allow for the creation of new markets, based on new
    business models, new products and new services. At the time writing, STARTS has
    three dedicated projects running and a relevant intervention in the Large Scale
    Pilots Initiative. Vertigo is promoting the integration of artists in knowledge
    generation systems by attributing grants for artistic residencies in research
    projects. Wearsustain is promoting the creation of new artistic driven prototypes.
    The STARTS Prize attributes yearly two distinctions for technological innovation
    through the arts. CREATE-IoT, the coordination project of the Large-Scale Pilot
    projects (LSPs) of the EU, also integrates the arts. CREATE-IoT has a crucial
    role in STARTS by promoting the notion of co-creation based on artistic practices
    within the LSPs and by introduction of the Experience Readiness Level indicator.
    8.2.4 Next Things_Next Starts Between December 2017 and April 2018, in Gijon,
    Spain, the exhibition Next Things_Next Starts showed for the first time the results
    of the research and production residency programme called Next Things organised
    by LABoral Centro de Arte y Creación Industrial in conjunction with Telefónica
    R+D over a five-year period with the mission to forge new connections and collaborations
    between art, science, technology and society. Following an open call issued to
    artists and other creatives, the most innovative ideas and projects related with
    the Internet of Things were chosen. The award consisted of organizing and funding
    a six-month residency – two months at LABoral, in Gijon and four at Telefónica
    I+D, in Barcelona – to materialise their ideas and projects. The exhibition was
    centred on the critical role played by creativity and social involvement in processes
    of innovation. Along with scientific and technical know-how and learning, art
    is a catalyst that helps transform knowledge into objects or processes. The showcased
    projects presented the paths which are opened up when combining creative thinking
    with the possibilities of open technology. The five critical and innovative projects
    chosen for the programme rethink and open a debate on contemporary situations
    stemming from technological advances. Through the creative use of new technologies,
    these projects propose prototypes for new solutions and working spaces. The exhibition
    was a first for STARTS in learning from previous experiences on artistic residencies
    in research contexts. The artists awarded with the prize were: Laura Malinverni
    and Lilia Villafuerte; Lot Amorós, Cristina Navarro and Alexandre Oliver; Sam
    Kronick; María Castellanos and Alberto Valverde; Román Torre and Ángeles Angulo.
    Here we present only three of those works as they represent a useful spectrum
    as examples for the integration of artists in the context of the IoT European
    Large-Scale Pilots. Environmental Dress represents the tendency of artists to
    engage with global matters such as climate change. Furthermore, the project demonstrates
    the capability of artists to technically implement elaborate systems as well as
    reiterating the importance of open source code and hardware. Figure 8.5 Environmental
    Dress, by María Castellanos and Alberto Valverde. “We are surrounded by polluting
    agents and other factors that have a direct impact on our everyday lives, our
    mood and, ultimately, on our behaviour. Variations in noise, temperature, atmospheric
    pressure, ultraviolet radiation or amounts of carbon monoxide are some of the
    challenges we have to face on a daily basis. At the end of the day, they are agents
    that influence our temper and our behaviour with others. Environment Dress is
    a piece of smart clothing that uses a number of sensors to measure the aggressiveness
    of our surrounding environs, detecting environmental variables and alerting us
    to them. Our body’s natural sensors are unable to measure and anticipate factors
    such as an increase in ultraviolet radiation, dust or noise, and others. The interface
    geo-locates environmental analyses and allows users to register their mood through
    a smartphone app. In consequence, we can establish the relationship between both
    variables and determine whether an increase in ultraviolet radiation can make
    the person who wears the dress feel better or whether an increase in noise level
    can make him or her feel more uncomfortable in a certain place. Finally, all these
    data are shown on an emotional map, pinpointing the most pleasant and unpleasant
    areas in a city.” (Source: catalogue of NEXT THINGS_NEXT STARTS Exhibition, LABoral,
    Gijon, Spain). Flone is representative of the need of artists to make technology
    accessible. In a subject matter such drones, with profound implications on security
    and privacy, the exposure and dissemination of how drones’ function is crucial,
    from an artistic point of view. Figure 8.6 Flone, the flying phone by Lot Amorós,
    Cristina Navarro, Alexandre Oliver. “Flone, The Flying Phone, is a platform to
    make smartphones fly, involving an innovative drone which combines digital manufacturing,
    personal empowerment and the use of a smartphone to remotely control the device.
    Flone is a self-built, low-cost biodegradable drone, conceived as an open source
    digital design. Some of its design elements (shape, size, material, lack of screws)
    make it accessible and adaptable for many people to conquer air space. The use
    of open software and documentation and the simplicity of making it democratise
    the knowledge needed to manufacture a drone and claim air space as a common domain.
    Flone aims at opening up the range of applications of air social robotics. This
    multimedia drone, a mobile multipurpose machine, moves through the public air
    space thanks to various smartphone sensors (camera, microphone, GPS, accelerometers,
    gyroscopes) and actuators (LED flash and speaker) together with wireless connections
    (Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and 4G). The members of this project have imparted workshops
    in countless schools, art centres and universities in several countries. Dozens
    of individuals have replicated this project worldwide and made a flone for themselves.”

    Thero reiterates the urgency of giving control to end users of the decision of
    being connected. Having the option to consciously connect or disconnect to the
    internet is nowadays extremely important mainly because a great number of people
    are not aware that they are constantly connected through their devices. Figure
    8.7 THERO by Román Torre and Ángeles Angulo. “As a concept, THERO wishes to raise
    our digital privacy to the status of a precious and sacred object. Accordingly,
    the object has been given a highly aesthetic treatment, with the geometry and
    clean lines of an idol or talisman endowed with a value beyond its material qualities:
    the value of freedom and the right to digital anonymity. THERO is presented as
    a heavy sculpture which contains a device that blocks and encrypts our digital
    communications by allowing the user to directly manipulate the object. By manually
    rotating its structure, THERO is capable of managing our digital contact with
    the outside space. The piece basically consists of a router to which we can wirelessly
    connect all our digital devices. It can be handled physically to offer various
    levels of privacy: blocking pages we do not want to visualise or which demand
    excessive attention from us, encrypting our communication by using the TOR network,
    completely blocking access to the network, cutting all communication with the
    outside in order to only browse locally. The piece opens up a space for reflection
    on our actions and their subsequent traces and significance in the net. THERO
    tries to lower the abstract barrier of the digital tool by means of a number of
    physical actions that make us more aware of our use of the Internet. The presence
    of THERO in our homes would give corporeity to the need for privacy in our digital
    interactions. In essence, THERO gives us the power to decide when we want and
    when we do not want to be visible.” (Source: catalogue of NEXT THINGS_NEXT STARTS
    Exhibition, LABoral, Gijon, Spain). The most important conclusion from the Next
    Things programme is the management of intellectual property in this type of context
    of collaboration of tech companies and artists: keep it all open source. 8.2.5
    Artists and the IoT European Large-Scale Projects In the CREATE-IoT project a
    methodology for integrating ICT and the arts – or better put: to include artistic
    practices in the ICT development cycle – was designed to be fully adaptable. Its
    implementation in the LSPs will result from specific combinations of its methods
    according to the specificities, not only of each one of the LSPs they will be
    tailored for, but of each of the particular LSPs’ use cases. The methodology is
    designed to be applied in the specific areas of innovation of the IoT LSPs initiative:
    food and farming, healthy aging, public mass events, self-driven vehicles and
    smart cities. The basic principles are implemented in the ICT framework through
    a sequence of actions that will be selected from the range of artistic related
    activities and their correlation with the ICT cycle. The actions of integration
    of artistic practices in the LSPs are being done mostly around their use cases.
    The reason for this option is to demonstrate that artistic practices are useful
    in connecting humans and technology, towards a human-centred approach to technology
    as an enabler of better lives in general. The methodology is developed around
    the development of artworks to trigger dialogue with the LSPs and raise some questions
    that might help improve their final solutions. The underlying idea is that the
    services provided by the LSPs can trigger socio-economic innovation if made available
    to SMEs and individuals. The first step was the integration of an artist in residency
    in the CREATE-IoT project. So Kanno, a Japanese artist proposed creating the The
    ideal showroom of IoT. The ideal showroom of IoT is a two-part composition, a
    participatory installation. It shows the possibility of sensing, recognising and
    determining the world through the perspective of objects. A living room full of
    IoT devices is set out to let visitors experience this shift: sensors and cameras
    are interweaved into a well-known environment. The second part is providing a
    new point of view to perceive a post-IoT age perspective onto things and technology.
    Figure 8.8 The ideal showroom of IoT. The installation is set up in two parts:
    The first is a living room with many small computers, cameras and sensors installed.
    Most of them are not obvious and are hidden. These systems try to capture information
    of the visitors. A robot in the room will welcome the visitors. It will introduce
    and explain the context of the work as well as trying to have a conversation with
    visitors. In second room, there’s a laboratory set up, with a desk and VR headset.
    Visitors will experience the living room now from different perspectives. When
    putting on the VR headset, the visitor will have the view from the hidden cameras
    or robot. Experiencing the same situation again through an object-related perspective
    should give the visitors a new perspective on IoT and personal robots. In this
    residency between CREATE-IoT and So Kanno, a new artistic work is being developed,
    challenging the fundamental issues of interest in the Internet of Things. CREATE-IoT
    provides access to the artist for key people, companies, concepts and technologies
    associated with Trust in the Internet of Things. Key elements will be made available
    to the artist regarding the development of a trusted environment for the development
    of IoT and comprehensive technical and non-technical solutions regarding privacy,
    security and trust issues. The development of the new artwork involves various
    levels of research and development. Existing IoT products are explored and researched
    and selected regarding the functions they include for the installation. Technology
    used for the project are IoT devices with hidden cameras, smart speaker systems,
    personal robots and VR technology. In the development of the art work, the consumer
    products will be manipulated and adjusted for the artistic purpose. The developed
    system will integrate the video stream of hidden IoT security cameras. The IoT
    devices and robot will be accessed and controlled through a VR headset experience.
    The second step is the development of model of artistically mediated co-creation
    process around an artwork. Towards the creation of exemplary case studies, the
    LSPs IoF2020, ACTIVAGE, SYNCHRONICITY are being developed in order to realise
    artistic-led co-creation hackathons as a support to some of the use cases of these
    pilots. The aim of these hackathons is to artistically enhance the context of
    those use cases and stimulate creativity of all participants. The concrete target
    is to better understand the role of artists in pushing for innovative approaches
    either in the technology in question or its applications. Impact on uptake, adoption
    and acceptance will also be observed, as well as the potential of new businesses
    built on top of the technologies made available by the LSPs under study. At the
    moment, the use cases that are being considered for action are part of IoF2020:
    Figure 8.9 Added-value weeding data. This use-case collects location-specific
    camera data to provide insights on the number of vegetables growing on the field,
    the plants’ growth status and best harvesting moment, weed prevalence, nutrient
    shortages and drought stress. From an artistic point of view, it is interesting
    to understand how agriculture is becoming less anthropocenic. Figure 8.10 City
    farming for leafy vegetables. IoT technology in city farming enables the production
    of high-quality vegetables in a predictable and reliable manner, unaffected by
    plant diseases, free from pesticides and independent of seasonal influences. From
    an artistic point of view, it is interesting to imagine better lives that could
    allow free-time to have contact with the vegetables we eat. Figure 8.11 Poultry
    chain management. The focus of this use case is mainly on the growth of poultry
    with respect to animal welfare. This starts with an adequate environment in which
    the birds feel comfortable, as well as good-quality feed and water. These are
    extremely important aspects from an artistic point of view. Some years ago, the
    artistic community started to be concerned with this type of challenges, especially
    after the film Baraka. An example of the possible impact of these actions in the
    IoF2020 would be to see in its open calls a focus on more human-centred technology
    based on the technologies made available by the project. That is one of the underlying
    principles of the choices use cases to work with. 8.2.6 CREATE Your IoT The present
    result of the work undertaken is a series of works entitled CREATE Your IoT. Drawing
    inspirations from the title of the coordination and support action to the LSPs,
    CREATE-IoT, the series aims at expanding it by pointing out ways of how other
    innovative actions can be implemented on top of the developments made available
    by LSPs. It emphasizes the co-creative aspect of the all LSPs but in an alternative
    sense than that of citizen participation as promoted by the U4IoT CSA. In the
    series, artworks are the core and are motive for dialogue between all actual and
    potential stakeholders in use-cases. The CREATE Your IoT Series is at the moment
    composed of two artworks under development. The Connected Hennery and The Migrant
    Home. The artworks are being designed to allow the integration of multiple technologies
    made available by the LSPs. For example, The Migrant Home could host technologies
    from all LSPs MONICA, AUTOPILOT, IoF2020, ACTIVAGE, SYNCHRONICITY. The Connected
    Hennery is a reflection about the use case of the Poultry chain management of
    IoF2020. Inspired by the motto of that use case to respect animal welfare, the
    artwork starts by giving the chicken the control of the location of their home.
    It follows recent tendencies of permaculture, within which mobile henneries are
    substitutes for tractors in the cleaning of agricultural land. In permaculture,
    chicken inhabiting a defined piece of land clean it and fertilize it. Farmers,
    by simply moving the hennery around their land, make it ready for cultivation.
    The digital system of The Connected Hennery analyses the position and movement
    of chicken inside the hennery and predicts in which direction they would like
    to progress next, freeing the farmer from that work task. Furthermore, other sensors
    implemented in the hennery allow easier monitoring for the farmer in order to
    simplify and more effectively manage her/his intervention in the maintenance of
    the hennery. The CREATE Your IoT Series is looking at decentralized models of
    production of chicken and at its potential as added value for the associated use
    cases of the LSPs. Food suppliers are looking at how consumers are more and more
    interested in biological and organic products and how can they adapt to keep their
    leadership of the supply markets. This leads these suppliers to create their own
    production experiments in order to better understand how to create new products
    the fit customers’ demands. It is for this sort of context that works such The
    Connected Hennery are being developed in order to promote the LSPs towards end
    users. The Migrant Home is still in the early phases of concept development. At
    this stage it is looking at how an IoT mobile house can be transformed into a
    home for migrants for short-term jobs/enterprises connected with urban and rural
    niche developments, for instance recovery of rural and urban cultural heritage.
    Preliminary experience of the development of the CREATE Your IoT Series reveals
    that Open Standards and Architectures in the LSPs are crucial to make the technologies
    developed accessible and allow for the development of new business models. 8.3
    Conclusion The actual context of the relationship between ICT and art allows for
    an unprecedented integration of subjectivity in the context of technological research.
    The integration of subjective approaches is fundamental in making human-centred
    technological innovation. Human-centred technological applications fill in the
    gap between what is possible from a pure technological point of view and what
    people can encounter as useful in their daily lives to make those lives better.
    The LSPs represent a unique opportunity for the spread of creative approaches
    to technological solutions and those approaches can help to potentiate the results
    of the LSPs in terms of new applications and associated business models. It is
    this reciprocal relationship that will allow on one side for an expansion of the
    field of action of the LSPs and on the other for the LSPs of potential fields
    for innovation to be informed. The instruments of those actions are the co-creation
    hackathons. They will develop around the artworks of the CREATE Your IoT Series
    to trigger new solutions based on the technologies made available by the LSPs.

    4.0BlockchainCloud computingEdge computingFog computing 1. Introduction The advancement
    of wireless technology resulted in the emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT),
    which has recently been extensively improved to make it more convenient for usage
    in present and future real-world based applications. IoT was first introduced
    in 1999 by a member of the Radiofrequency Identification (RFID) business association.
    Then it started to gain attention for real-world applications due to the continued
    rise of electronic devices, cloud computing services, and data analytics [1].
    IoT nodes are sensor adapted pieces of hardware that transmit perceived data over
    the internet. Thus, it is clear that this network system has its roots in several
    conventional technologies, including ubiquitous informatics, embedded systems,
    and sensor networks. In addition to having already provided numerous advantages
    in the environment, transportation, health care and smart homes sectors, it is
    having a particularly significant impact on the industry by enabling more structured,
    controlled, and optimized observation at a lower cost. The Industrial Internet
    of Things (IIoT) helps industries to run more efficiently, resulting in cost reductions
    in capital expenditure (CAPEX) and operating expenses (OPEX) [2]. It refers to
    computer-linked interconnected equipment as well as industrial applications such
    as production and energy management. Fig. 1 depicts how industrial IoT and consumer
    IoT interact to preserve the digital connection with the assistance of an intelligent
    network system for large and small-scale networks. In this context, IoT is active
    in the retail sector, whereas IIoT is associated with the industrial sector, making
    it an essential step in enhancing manufacturers’ operating performance. Download

    Internet of Things and Industrial Internet of Things. Industrial IoT is an advanced
    subtype of IoT that combines networked devices and technologies with mechanization
    applications intended specifically for industrial communication. Previously, most
    industrial wireless technologies were based on ad hoc solutions, but with the
    help of industrial IoT, cost-effective technologies such as WirelessHART and ISA100.11a
    are being created with more adaptability [3]. IIoT is a persuasive concept that
    connects various sensors around us to the internet, opening up wonderful prospects
    for the appreciation of a fantastic way of life [4]. IIoT is now recognized as
    the most ideal approach to achieve production performance as it can combine both
    information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT) domains, reducing
    operating costs and greater relevance in machine to machine communication. A cost
    reduction in this scenario can be achieved in industrial applications such as
    the production of industrial equipment and operational energy distribution systems.
    IIoT applications contribute to the formation of Smart Factories, which connect
    all devices embedded with sensors over the internet to enable advanced visibility
    of activities through real-time data access. In industry, IoT environmental monitoring
    helps maintain a healthy work environment by detecting the presence of smoke and
    other contaminants and measuring air and water quality. Information gathered from
    the work environment is relayed through Bluetooth from each cluster to the centralized
    server [4]. Smart grid, industrial automation, smart electricity, and smart communication
    are some of the other IIoT applications that work with enormous amounts of data
    in a timely and efficient manner to increase productivity at a low cost. The opportunities
    created through IIoT, such as improved customer experience, data confidentiality,
    continuous data streaming, increasing GDP, and many others, are assisting industries
    in growing more quickly than they otherwise would. The advent of this technology
    allows industrial equipment or systems to sense and react accordingly to their
    surroundings and other conditions. By 2025, the IIoT is predicted to produce $11
    trillion in annual earnings, with business to business (B2B) solutions responsible
    for 70% of this total [5]. Rather than manual machine operation, machines may
    work and solve mechanical difficulties by altering their modulation approach constantly
    with the assistance of IIoT smart devices. Although numerous IIoT applications
    have been developed recently, the technology is still in its initial phase, therefore,
    the aforementioned issues are to be expected. Previous review studies on IIoT
    have identified several issues with its communication technology without providing
    a thorough explanation of how the challenges might be overcome using IIoT-enabled
    technologies. Also, many studies have focused only on the current application
    and challenges without mentioning the opportunities this technology opens for
    industrial growth and increased consumer satisfaction. This study thus aims to
    provide insights into IIoT-enabled technologies and infrastructure, focusing on
    their importance in driving global industrial growth, their applications, challenges,
    and future recommendations on resolving current issues and opening up new opportunities.
    The specific objectives of the current review include: (i) Identify the present
    state of knowledge in the field to help academics understand IIoT ideas, concepts,
    models, and empirical investigations and the progress accomplished. (ii) Provide
    a complete overview of the state-of-the-art knowledge in the field by synthesizing
    and summarizing the results of relevant studies on IIoT in order to identify recurring
    themes, patterns, and trends. (iii) Identify research gaps and opportunities for
    further study to highlight IIoT''s unresolved questions, unknown areas, and developing
    trends. (iv) Propose potential strategies and approaches for improving the field
    based on the research gaps and evaluating the existing state of knowledge. This
    review will assist industrialists to comprehend the necessity and utilization
    of IIoT technology for an industry''s growth, the establishment of new business
    models, and enhancing market competitiveness. The present work is structured as
    follows: Methodological procedures for conducting the review are outlined in Section
    2. Industry 4.0 and IIoT have been introduced and discussed in Section 3. The
    technologies that enable IIoT have been explored and analyzed in Section 4 so
    that their characteristics, strengths, and shortcomings can be identified. Section
    5 identifies and discusses the challenges and benefits associated with IIoT-enabled
    technologies and applications. This section also includes prospective recommendations
    based on the identified issues. A conclusion is presented based on the complete
    study in the final Section 6. 2. Methodology Using an integrative literature review
    approach, this study explores the industrial IoT enabled technologies associated
    with their applications, challenges, and future directions. High-quality, pertinent
    papers were gathered, screened, and analyzed during this process. Database searches
    were conducted using prominent online resources including Google Scholar and Scopus
    as well as highly regarded academic publishers like Elsevier, Nature, Taylor &
    Francis, Wiley, Sage, Springer, ACS, Frontiers, MDPI, Inderscience, and Frontiers.
    A wide variety of keywords such as “Industrial IoT”, “Industrial Internet of Things”,
    “Applications of industrial IoT”, “Industrial IoT-enabled technologies”, and “Challenges
    of industrial IoT” were used to search for pertinent publications. It was found
    that in recent years, the industrial IoT has garnered considerable attention and
    momentum in a wide range of disciplines as shown in Fig. 2. Download : Download

    publications trends (a) year-wise (b) sector wise. The bibliographies and references
    of the works mentioned above were collected and compiled in order to search for
    more related works. We went through the selected papers'' abstracts, introductions,
    and conclusions, classifying them based on the criteria below: (i) Peer-reviewed
    publications only from reputable websites and publishers were initially considered
    (ii) Papers written by scientists currently working in the field were collected
    (iii) A proper balance between current and previous studies was maintained in
    the collected papers (iv) Commercial websites employing the keywords mentioned
    above were considered (v) The cutting-edge technologies available that are relevant
    to this study were taken into account (vi) Important articles cited in previous
    recent works were retrieved, and a thorough evaluation was conducted of the original
    sources used in the studies. Numerous questions came out about recent works throughout
    the process of our study. In order to answer these questions and improve the review''s
    overall quality, further literature searches and readings were conducted. During
    the literature search, we identified a few crucial phrases to help us defend our
    rationale. Keywords such as “Internet of Things”, “IIoT”, “Industry 4.0”, “Cloud
    computing”, “Fog computing”, “Internet of Things”, “Edge computing”, and “Big
    data analytics” were chosen to facilitate the progress of the investigation. As
    the focus of the investigation improved, the list of keywords was refined. 3.
    Industrial IoT and Industry 4.0 IIoT is considered as the 4th industrial revolution,
    or Industry 4.0, due to its contribution to advancing IoT, the internet of services,
    automation systems, the integration of cyber-physical systems (CPS), cloud computing,
    augmented reality, wireless technologies, concentric computing and more [6]. The
    concept of Industry 4.0 emerged in Germany''s manufacturing industry as part of
    the government''s high-tech growth agenda. Preceding industrial revolutions resulted
    in mechanization (the first industrial revolution, or Industry 1.0), contributed
    to electricity (Industry 2.0), and gave us information technology (Industry 3.0),
    whereas the present industrial revolution (Industry 4.0) is driving digital transformation
    through the advancement of IoT technology. Fig. 3 describes industrial digitalization
    and its transition over time. In short, Industry 4.0 is mainly an evolution of
    digital signal transmission technology based on advanced cyber-physical systems
    (CPS) built for industrial manufacturing processes. Download : Download high-res

    revolutions. The notion of Industry 4.0 is also known as the “Factory of the Future”
    (FoF) or the “Smart Factory” due to the use of smart machines comprised of CPS
    for productivity purposes in the industry. It generates a business ecosystem that
    helps to connect assets, resources, infrastructure, and other commercial strategies
    across various businesses so they can interact and regulate each other in a decentralized
    manner. This industrial revolution has replaced the traditional production system
    with intelligent manufacturing and as a result, national economies are making
    significant progress with the help of high-tech gadgets. In terms of digital transformation,
    Industry 4.0 is a broad concept of industrial growth, whereas IIoT is one of the
    major components used to achieve that progress. As shown in Fig. 4, while Industry
    4.0 aims to solve all industrial networking difficulties and create opportunities
    in the business sectors, IIoT is only one of the major components assisting Industry
    4.0 to reach its goal. According to Pereira et al. [7], because Industry 4.0 has
    shifted from centralized networks to decentralized networks, it cannot function
    without IIoT, which was developed specifically to deploy equipment using decentralized
    intelligence. As a result, it is apparent that IIoT is playing a significant role
    in advanced industrialization as an essential component of Industry 4.0. Download

    Elements of Industry 4.0. 4. Industrial IoT-enabled technologies Digital and physical
    technology are combined in the new industrial landscape, often recognized as Industry
    4.0, to demonstrate flexible, networked processes. Enterprises are utilizing the
    internet and other associated technologies to make fast choices across the supply
    chain and the smart factory. IIoT solutions leverage edge and connected sensors
    to make real-time improvements to manufacturing productivity and product quality.
    The IoT concept is supported by the internet''s globalization, openness, interoperability,
    and socialization. Regardless of whether they are industrial or consumer-oriented,
    IoT systems emphasize the connections between items through physical addresses,
    whereas the industrial internet shows probable future patterns of industries based
    on new technology. Studies should focus on cloud computing, the IoT, and big data
    analytics in the future. Highly effective methods to manage and store massive
    amounts of data are artificial intelligence (AI) and data mining. Fuzzy logic
    and neural networks are used in AI. Data pre-processing, filtering, clustering,
    selection, conversion, and pattern analysis are the steps used in data mining.
    Around 40% of IoT benefits to nearly all industrial applications are found in
    the finding, looking, and exchanging of information and resources [8]. IoT may
    be reduced and controlled while maximizing its value by utilizing real-time data
    and knowledge mining using several technologies (Fig. 5) including data analytics/modeling,
    machine learning, edge, and fog computing, and blockchain. However, it is clear
    that IIoT cannot reach its full potential without ensuring proper security. Download

    Industrial IoT-enabled technologies. 4.1. Cyber physical system The cyber physical
    system (CPS) is one of the fundamental technologies of Industry 4.0 that uses
    embedded intelligent systems in production machinery to connect the manufacturing
    sectors to the real environment [9]. It combines with IoT to link the real world
    of manufacturing with the virtual one. Through the integration of networking,
    computation, and storage, CPS creates smart factories by enabling an interactive
    industrial environment. From this vantage point, smart products are becoming increasingly
    identifiable and trackable. CPSs are automated distributed systems that connect
    communication networks and computing infrastructures with physical reality. They
    differ from conventional embedded systems in that they place a greater emphasis
    on Industry 4.0 device networking. As a result, they comprise a control unit that
    can manage a sensor and an actuator that creates interaction with the physical
    environment. They then process the collected data and exchange it with other applications
    and services via a communication channel. These systems should be stable, dependable,
    secure, and effective during service. For this purpose, one of Industry 4.0’s
    objectives is to offer optimal security support across all CPS network tiers,
    securing sensitive data while ensuring data anonymity. Physical system integration
    is a significant problem since it impacts the system''s qualities, including maintainability,
    functioning, extension, adaptability, and variability [9]. An industrial CPS architecture
    was suggested by Hinojosa-Palafox et al. [10]. The architecture specification
    was established using an attribute-based design technique to collect the parameters
    that ensure the quality of the data and big data management attributes (functional
    requirements) from initiation/planning, manufacturing, and maintenance. These
    components allowed the adoption of an architecture model for data analysis design
    for industrial big data, including prediction and KPI inference. The infrastructure
    is divided into three layers: infrastructure, monitoring, and presentation from
    a functional standpoint. The provision of component deployment, which met all
    functional needs using open-source technologies, was also made available. Prior
    research focuses in particular on guiding principles for a CPS implementation
    technique. Contrary to those recommendations, the industrial data quality/management
    attributes that Hinojosa-Palafox et al. introduced are significant for iCPS analytics.
    However, one potential drawback of this work is the lack of a practical implementation
    of the suggested architecture. Thakur & Kumar Seghal [11] suggested a heterogeneous
    model for a smart cyber-physical system that enables the execution of hybrid process
    dynamics by integrating various electrical, pneumatic, and hydraulic processes.
    The proposed architecture can separate the moving aspects of a process, including
    computation, control, communication, and actuation, from each other in order to
    foresee potential risks and delays in the process. A voltage frequency (VF) island
    with great modulations distinct for each operation is used to distribute computing
    attached cores to various physical operations. Some significant aspects connected
    to the designing of efficient CPS that are explored in the study are the design
    of compensators, estimation and compensation of disturbances, delays of sensors
    and actuators, energy-saving with dynamic (VF) scaling, and the VF island division
    of processing elements utilized for control algorithms. To assess some other domains
    (oil, space, defence, and so on), the suggested study could be expanded by incorporating
    self-perception computation and actuation in the system in both fixed and dynamic
    operations. In order to establish security in industrial CPS, Althobaiti et al.
    [12] provided a revolutionary cognitive computing-based intrusion detection system
    (IDS) technique. Data collection, pre-processing, feature selection, classification,
    and parameter optimization are only a few of the various phases of operation that
    the suggested model includes. Pre-processing is used in the model to eliminate
    data noise. The best subset of features was then chosen by the provided model
    using a feature selection technique based on binary bacterial foraging optimization
    (BBFO). The gated recurrent unit (GRU) algorithm was also used to detect intrusions
    in the industrial CPS context. Finally, the hyperparameter optimization of the
    GRU model was carried out using the Nesterov-accelerate Adaptive Moment Estimation
    optimizer. The suggested model demonstrated notable performance with an accuracy
    of 98.45%. Future industrial CPS security can be increased using lightweight cryptographic
    approaches. Additionally, outlier detection algorithms can eliminate undesired
    samples from the dataset. 4.2. Blockchain technology It is not easy to securely
    share data with all parties participating in an IIoT network. Blockchain technology
    is well suited for IIoT because of its distinctive features including distributed
    attributes, trackability, durability, certainty, tamper resistance, reliability,
    and built-in data origin. Blockchain is a particular sort of data structure that
    implements distributed ledger with Bitcoin and uses public key cryptography to
    facilitate secured peer-to-peer network transactions. Each link in the chain contains
    a reference to the previous link''s hash. The strong advantages of blockchain
    improve IoT security and provide decentralized access to IoT data, increasing
    its potency for revealing fraudulent activity. The primary barrier to the adoption
    of blockchain technology is its inability to scale, which will only become worse
    as the number of IoT gadgets grows. As a result, transaction conflicts may also
    rise. Due to the fact that each blockchain transaction needs approval from every
    sharing node in the network, there will be more transactions than there would
    be with a centralized database system, which results in higher latency. Additionally,
    maintaining hash codes and encryption keys is a laborious operation. An architecture
    based on blockchain was developed by Latif et al. [13] to guarantee reliable and
    secure operations in the industry. The blockchain network was equipped with a
    highly scalable, quick, and energy-effective consensus method called proof of
    authentication, and real-time cryptographic techniques were executed. The architecture
    developed in this study has been the subject of many trials and analyses which
    have demonstrated its usefulness. Finally, the researchers executed the suggested
    design and produced remarkable results for blockchain technology, transforming
    a typical fruit processing facility into a safe and intelligent industrial platform.
    Prior studies concentrated on the storage of sensor data using blockchain technology,
    while this study focused on a number of operations in smart industry systems.
    The study made a significant contribution by introducing lightweight authentication
    and cryptography at the device level, ensuring data security outside blockchain-driven
    networks. Umran et al. [14] built a blockchain method for an application in the
    cement industry. The mechanism requires minimum power usage, is scalable, provides
    high security, and can effectively manage access to vital data produced by sensors
    and actuators. Due to its effectiveness in processing cryptographic algorithms,
    a low-powered ARM Cortex-M processor was used, significantly enhancing the suggested
    architecture''s computational performance. Additionally, the blockchain architecture
    uses proof of authentication as a consensus method in place of proof of work (PoW)
    to guarantee secure authentication, scalability, speed, and energy efficiency.
    According to experimental data, the suggested framework delivers significant security,
    scalability, and optimal efficiency for a digital industrial environment. The
    approach resolved the 51% security issue and Sybil attack that was caused by existing
    consensus algorithms like PoW, PoC, and DPoC. As a result, the study offers a
    security system with low computational complexity and good performance which can
    ensure data communication security between peers in the cement industry context.
    In order to provide security for a company using IIoT with branches spread across
    several nations, Rathee et al. [15] devised a hybrid blockchain system. The approach
    developed was carefully verified against traditional mechanisms with a variety
    of security parameters. The simulation findings showed that the suggested method
    reduced the threat of Proof-of-Stake (DoS)/DDoS, text modification attacks, and
    authentication lag by 94%. This strategy involves distinct clients from different
    zones. Since user data is stored in several places, this may include various security
    threats, such as data leakage in the middle, making false data, and additional
    expenses. 4.3. Fog computing Fog computing is considered an extension of cloud
    computing, making it possible for most commercial apps and operations to interact
    with IoT. Fog computing refers to a situation in which wireless and decentralized
    gadgets interact with a network to carry out required operations in industrial
    applications without the influence of any outside parties. Fog computing is the
    provision of web services using IT infrastructure. The essential parts of the
    computation are the fog nodes which comprise devices that provide storage, processing
    power, and virtual network connectivity. These nodes can be utilized for machine
    learning-driven experiments, system optimizations, and predicting system failure.
    All fog nodes that are situated before the inaccessible hop are always reachable
    and can thus continue to service the local system if the connection fails anywhere
    along the way from the local fog nodes to the remote cloud. For many industrial
    applications, fog computation serves as a link between static and dynamic computation
    environments. Tange et al. [16] undertook research to examine how the emerging
    paradigm of Fog computing may be used to meet the IIoT''s security needs. Fog
    computing, as an emerging computing paradigm, can become a strong tool in securing
    a variety of linked industrial contexts, as demonstrated by the study, which identifies
    an abundance of research prospects in the IIoT security field. The resource management
    using genetic algorithms (GA) and ML technique for maintenance prediction in fog
    computing was presented by Teoh et al. [17]. The FogWorkflowsim simulates the
    time, cost, and energy measurement of GA together with the methods Min-Min, Max-Min,
    FCFS, and Round Robin. Employing real-time observations, the model for maintenance
    prediction is constructed using two classes of logistic regression. The findings
    showed that the technique demonstrated better performance than Min-Min, Max-Min,
    FCFS, and Round Robin on execution time, expense, and energy consumption. In comparison
    to the second-best results, the execution time is 0.48% faster, the cost is 5.43%
    less, and the amount of energy used is 28.10% less. The prediction model has a
    95.1% training accuracy and a 94.5% testing accuracy, respectively. To prevent
    cyberattacks, however, there is a need to provide current industrial security
    communication among the devices, which is not available in the study. Additionally,
    the simulation''s performance metrics may include network latency, bandwidth,
    and jitter. Benomar et al. [18] developed an architecture built on the fog computing
    concept intended for industrial monitoring tasks. A fog layer was developed to
    provide a data aggregation approach dependent on single-valued decomposition.
    The OMNET++ simulator was used to examine the advantages of the suggested approach
    in measuring performance, such as latency and packet delivery rate. A real-life
    case of a distributed monitoring system for an industrial motor was used. Additionally,
    the system employed a variety of security measures at various levels. For industrial
    motors with limited resources, it particularly suggests a novel, lightweight,
    and energy-efficient ciphering approach. The proposed method can be applied in
    the future to more domains that call for actuation and are essential in the industry.
    The fog layer described could be studied as a potential approach for latency reduction
    since this may in fact be significantly time-saving. Quality of experience (QoE)
    based technique for dynamic resource allocation in fog computing was developed
    by Aazam et al. [19], consisting of a mathematical model incorporating a net promoter
    score (NPS), which measures the system''s quality of experience. NPS is a 0–10
    scale used to measure user satisfaction, with a score of 0–6 denoting negative
    feedback, sometimes known as distractors. Users who provide input in this range
    are referred to as passive. A score of 7–8 is considered to be neutral. Users
    that provided 9–10 or more favourable reviews are known as promoters [20]. By
    considering the user''s prior NPS for a certain operation to the total NPS score
    of that specific operation, the suggested methodology calculates a QoE ratio.
    Resources are assigned based on the ratio for the following scenarios: default
    state (no prior NPS), NPS provided by user > total NPS, NPS provided by user <
    total NPS. The ratio for scaling the resources must be based on the QoE given
    by users and is determined by an effective mathematical model that the authors
    proposed. 4.4. Cloud computing High speed computer systems that are highly dispersed
    are required for processing, analysing, and storing the huge amount of data generated
    by IIoT. Technologies for cloud computing offer computation, networking, and storage
    capabilities across all the components of IIoT systems. Backend clouds are directly
    interfaced with all related hardware and software. By introducing cloud computing
    and graphic processing units, rendering and computational power have recently
    significantly increased, and visualization is growing in popularity. In addition,
    IIoT and AI are continually integrating, and 5G and other upcoming technologies
    like VR, AR, and mixed reality (MR) are being used increasingly in the industry,
    education, and medical training. The options for cloud services include private
    (exclusively owned and maintained by a particular authority), public (exclusively
    owned and maintained by cloud suppliers), and hybrid (a mixture of public and
    private). A private cloud is not a realistic choice for newly established and
    small/medium-sized businesses because the setup of data centres and the hiring
    of staff demand considerable investment. However, to secure the safety, security,
    and privacy of their users as well as combat industrial espionage for a competitive
    edge, major and established companies choose the construction of a private cloud.
    In the study conducted by Senthilkumar & Rajesh [21], a deep learning method recurrent
    neural network (RNN) was combined with the model-based engineering (MBE) method
    to govern the flow of tasks in a cloud network. In a cloud computing context,
    RNN predicts future workloads and supplies the necessary resources to maintain
    workflow balance. The whole process of making predictions is predicated on the
    pace of data intake from IIoT devices. The virtual machines in the cloud environment
    handle storing or processing of the input data. Utilizing RNN to improve the process,
    resources are allocated, and task scheduling is done on the control plane. The
    RNN is restarted to complete the optimization job repeatedly. This study creates
    a framework that successfully balances the cloud workflow and data collecting
    pace. Liu et al. [22] developed an immersive VR simulator that is integrated into
    an AR-driven brain tumour neurosurgery remote collaborative virtual surgical teaching
    system. Through 5G transmission, the device allows for real-time remote surgery
    training engagement. The trial to validate the system was open to six specialists
    and 18 beginners. The two simulators were then assessed utilizing techniques for
    face and construction validation. The outcomes of the face and content validation
    showed that the AR simulator was more effective at improving surgical skills than
    the VR simulator regarding vision and scene authentication. The method does, however,
    have significant drawbacks. This work used an external camera to scan and register
    digital pictures before layering real-world scenes and models over them. This
    is distinct from the registration of a virtual representation of a particular
    anatomical structure with the patient''s actual object (segmented MR image reconstruction).
    More complex aspects like blood flow and pulse cannot yet be accurately simulated.
    Using a probabilistic graphical model, an intelligent trust assessment technique
    built on mobile edge computing was presented by Wang et al. [23] to evaluate the
    trustworthiness of sensor nodes thoroughly. The suggested approach analyses data
    and communication behaviour to evaluate the credibility of sensor nodes. Additionally,
    the edge nodes’ movement path is planned to reduce the moving distance and increase
    the likelihood of direct trust evaluation. A performance-verifiable approximation
    method was created. Numerous tests showed that the approach can successfully assure
    the reliability of sensor nodes while reducing energy usage. This strategy can
    efficiently shorten the running time without considerably increasing the moving
    distance. 4.5. Edge computing Using computing, storage, and network sources scattered
    across the channels between data resources and cloud computing hubs, edge computing
    is a new idea that examines and operates data. In order to execute the local processing
    of data sources, make a few quick judgments, and upload computation results or
    pre-processed data to the centre, edge computing utilizes edge devices with sufficient
    computing capability. Edge computing effectively lowers the system''s overall
    latency and the need for bandwidth, and raises the system''s overall performance.
    Uses of edge computing in the smart industry enable businesses to implement effective
    security measures nearby, which mitigates security threats by lowering the likelihood
    of data breaches during communication and the amount of data retained in the cloud
    centre. However, there is an additional cost at the local end even though cloud
    storage costs are low. This is mostly due to the development of storage space
    for edge devices. Edge computing has benefits, but there is also a risk. To prevent
    data loss, the system must be carefully designed and configured before being implemented.
    Many edge computing devices trash useless data after collection, which is appropriate,
    but if the data is useful and is lost, the cloud analysis will be inaccurate.
    The scheduling issue in edge computing was solved by Wu et al. [24] using deep
    reinforcement learning (deep RL) to raise the standard of services offered to
    customers in IIoT applications. They developed a hierarchical scheduling approach
    taking the heterogeneous central-edged computing framework into account. After
    that, a double deep Q network framework-based deep intelligence scheduling algorithm
    (DISA) was suggested to create scheduling decisions for communication in accordance
    with the model''s characteristics. The study used a variety of performance indicators
    to compare DISA with other benchmark systems. The proposed method showed significant
    improvement over the existing approaches in terms of scheduling, latency analysis,
    and bandwidth consumption. Although the running time was improved, there is scope
    for further improvement. For activities requiring delay-responsive computing in
    multi-user IIoT mobile edge computing systems, Deng et al. [25] suggested an autonomous
    partial offloading system in their study. The objective was to offer offloading
    services with little to no delay to improve the quality of services (QoS). This
    method provided two offloading techniques based on RL to automatically improve
    delay performance. To offer a discrete partial offloading decision, firstly the
    Q-learning algorithm was developed. Then the task offloading choices were delivered
    as continuous built-on deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) to optimize the
    system''s performance with more relaxed job offloading. According to the simulation
    results, the Q-learning scheme and the DDPG method both minimize the latency,
    by 30% and 23%, respectively. The algorithm has difficulties due to the regional
    variation in network traffic. In a sophisticated edge computing-driven architecture
    with a service migration function, the issue of computing offloading of IIoT applications
    can be taken into consideration. You & Tang [26] proposed the use of an energy-effective
    and low-delay task offloading technique built on particle swarm optimization (PSO)
    to move work from edge devices with limited resources to edge servers. A suggested
    multi-objective optimization problem considers task execution costs, energy usage,
    and time delay. The cost of offloading all tasks to various MEC servers is represented
    by the particle''s fitness function. Through simulation studies, the genetic algorithm
    (GA) and the simulated annealing algorithm (SA) are put up against the offloading
    technique based on PSO. The experimental findings demonstrated that the PSO-based
    task offloading technique can efficiently achieve suitable resource allocation
    while reducing the MEC server''s lag time and energy consumption. PSO lowers the
    overall cost in terms of energy use by about 12%. The service requirement for
    high reliability was not considered in this study; only the criteria for low latency
    and low energy consumption were considered. 4.6. Big data analytics Massive data
    streams are produced by IIoT systems and devices, necessitating the use of extremely
    complex highly performing computing platforms for big data analysis. The IoT''s
    substantially increased data volumes prevented the usage of traditional data processing
    techniques. The IoT focuses on big data and AI to draw conclusions and make decisions
    from sensory information because there are so many smart things (SThs) and entities
    of interests (EoIs) connected to the cloud. In contrast to typical big data issues,
    IoT big data has unique characteristics. IIoT systems enable many technologies/methods
    for collecting massive data, storing, managing, processing, analysing, and assembling
    multiple big data analytics operations. The technologies for data collecting offer
    connections to a wide range of data sources, sensors, digital devices, and human
    machine interactions in the IIoT system. A massive amount of data may be handled
    close to sensors, edge servers, and in cloud centres by data management and processing
    technology. Data analysis technologies offer a variety of techniques for data
    mining, ML, DL, and statistical analysis across various IIoT system tiers. Communication
    between IIoT gadgets and their surroundings is made possible by actuation technology.
    Technologies to process and analyse big data are a key component of the future
    generation of IIoT systems, notwithstanding their complexity. Ren et al. [27]
    designed and deployed an approach to big data platforms and an intelligent industrial
    IoT sensor monitoring method based on edge computing and AI for the manufacturing
    sector. The IoT sensors gather information inside the industrial production factory
    about environmental conditions like vibration, temperature, etc. Condition data
    is a key component that enables the IIoT to adopt intelligent and scalable manufacturing.
    These condition data are gathered for more in-depth analysis and study, and they
    can alert factory administrators to the upcoming emergence of any fault. Along
    with the alarm mentioned above, the system also includes a prediction analysis
    for the percentage of defective items that the manufacturing machine will create.
    Despite the progress, some security and protection are still lacking. Over a multi-layered
    programmable industrial architecture, Njah & Cheriet [28] developed a technique
    called ROSA (centralized route optimization and service assurance). The suggested
    system carries a variety of heterogeneous flows, including bandwidth-sensitive
    services and ultra-reliable lower-latency communications. The routing optimization
    problems are put forth as shortest path problems with several constraints. The
    problem of NP-hard complexity is resolved using the Lagrangian relaxation method.
    In order to meet QoS recommendations, efficiently allocate limited resources,
    and improve the network''s energy usage, the method deployed a pair of parallel
    routing algorithms that are operated in accordance with the flow type. Compared
    to well-known benchmarks, the output indicated significant efficiency in lowering
    bandwidth usage by 22%, delay by 21%, packet losses by more than 19%, flow interruption
    by roughly 16%, and energy consumption by 4%. The recent studies conducted on
    industrial IoT-enabled technologies are tabulated in Table 1 along with their
    outcomes, applications and weaknesses/strengths. Table 1. Summary of recent studies
    conducted on Industrial IoT enabled technologies. Technologies/architectures Objective

    is stored in multiple locations, which poses security risks such data leakage,
    inaccurate data, and extra costs. [14] Fog computing Provide a data aggregation
    approach that depends on single valued decomposition, a fog layer was developed.
    Compared to AES-128, the proposed method consumes significantly less energy (reduced
    by a factor of 3). Industrial monitoring tasks The fog layer described can be
    studied as a potential approach to latency reduction. [17] Provide a quality of

    set with more categorization labels could be studied in the future. [28] 5. Challenges,
    benefits and future directions for industrial IoT The concept of IIoT introduces
    a network of sensors, devices and machineries connected with each other in industrial
    applications, such as automated equipment monitoring and energy management. IIoT
    takes advantage of IoT communications focusing on interoperability between machines
    in these applications. However, IoT services can become inconsistent due to some
    difficulties caused by heterogeneity, dynamicity, and data volume, which are critical
    to industrial applications. Recent studies have shown that enabling different
    techniques, such as data fusion, big data, machine learning, blockchain, cloud
    computing, and fog computing, can result in valuable impacts in this area. Moreover,
    the recent trends in big data analytics (BDA) can lead to the advancement of automated
    and smart IoT-embedded systems in industrial applications. While there are numerous
    benefits to implementing IIoT, there are also drawbacks. As there are a lot of
    devices connected to each other in IIoT and a lot of data needs to be analysed
    in a short amount of time, a lack of proper device maintenance, failure to ensure
    a secure network service or data confidentiality, a lack of individual access
    control policies, the absence of a solution for machine errors, and human errors
    can negatively impact the ability of industries to operate successfully. Many
    researchers claim that skilled labour and user awareness can alleviate these problems
    and create opportunities to address industrial requirements. The innovative taxonomy
    of industrial IoT challenges proposed by Alabadi et al. [29] takes into account
    not only the problems themselves but also the terminology and methods used to
    address them. As reported by the authors, these issues include heterogeneity,
    real-time processing, mobility, resource restrictions, connectivity, and scalability.
    The incorporation of big data and artificial intelligence can make a significant
    impact in different application areas of Industry 4.0. But there are also challenges
    with big data and AI-based technologies in these advanced applications across
    several criteria, such as availability, integrity, interpretability, auditing,
    and security/privacy issues. Furthermore, well-organized industrial infrastructures
    can benefit from decentralized communication in IoT infrastructures, often called
    peer-to-peer (P2P). There also are industrial knowledge graphs (IKG) enabled systems
    that are capable of creating higher value to utilize knowledge as a service rather
    than a resource in IIoT-driven applications with smart manufacturing processes.
    More detailed and in-depth research should be carried out to develop IKG-based
    techniques in the future. 5.1. Real-time performance IoT devices and sensors can
    capture information from different data sources and respond in real-time by utilizing
    big data analytics, blockchain technology, artificial intelligence, and cloud
    and edge computing. They are intelligent enough to automate processes, predict
    failures, and detect security threats in a real-time IoT based system. A monitoring
    system with temperature and humidity sensors can be used to control heating or
    cooling devices remotely in real time. The results from the sensed data can also
    be presented to end users through cloud and Android applications. A real-time
    scheduling strategy can be deployed in an IoT-based smart automated system using
    a microcontroller-driven Arduino board and mobile-enabled application. The strategy
    is quite capable of controlling the system environment with the available switching
    functions and thus can achieve high performance. Additionally, an intelligent
    traffic control scheme and a remote patient monitoring system using an electrocardiogram
    (ECG) can be implemented in real-time as IoT applications. The integration of
    IoT sensors and a big data processing system is more efficient for computing an
    exceptionally large amount of data [30]. The processing of the big data platform
    uses a message queue, a processing engine in real-time, and a database to store
    the sensor data obtained from the industrial and manufacturing process. The experimental
    results found by Syafrudin et al. [30] revealed that the IoT-enabled sensors can
    achieve a satisfactory output by successfully collecting and transmitting the
    data with acceptable latency and low computational cost. Nevertheless, the security
    of IoT based systems and possible unexpected circumstances that occur during the
    automation process should be considered in future research. A distributed system
    for stream processing for IoT-based applications can enhance the quality of service
    by facilitating real-time analysis for IoT applications, which nowadays is very
    crucial to fulfilling the requirements of these applications. A prototype along
    with the integration of a distributed stream processing system with IoT was further
    developed to obtain the achievable best outcome for stream processing. After performing
    an evaluation with peak stream rates from 100k to 1M, their research concluded
    that Apache NiFi is the most acceptable solution for IoT-based applications. However,
    they did not discuss safety/security analysis in this paper due to it being a
    separate and broad research area of IoT based applications. Therefore, their research
    recommended the future exploration of security and prescriptive analytical models
    from different aspects in time-critical applications. 5.2. Energy efficiency Better
    resource management and energy efficiency are two areas where IIoT will continue
    to aid sustainability initiatives. Modern IoT systems incorporate wireless sensors
    that gather data to monitor processes and manage operations in different applications.
    When IoT devices are developed, they have to consider energy efficiency to maintain
    their functionality in the long term. Many research studies focus on optimizing
    the energy consumption of IoT devices and making the system more efficient. There
    are prominent wireless technologies by considering system integrity, energy efficiency,
    communication capability, and security. Energy-constrained nodes in an IoT-based
    system will require maximum energy efficiency across the dynamic ranges of operation
    under different conditions including data rate specifications, battery conditions,
    and the implementation process. Moreover, mixed integer linear programming (MILP)
    utilized in an embedded IoT framework is capable of saving processing power and
    communication power dissipation at an average of 27% and 36%, respectively [31].
    However, there are certain challenges related to energy consumption when fog computing
    is used in a massive IoT network and designing energy-saving techniques for such
    networks should be considered in future research. Future applications of IIoT
    should utilize real-time data insights and automation to improve energy efficiency,
    reduce waste, and increase overall sustainability. IoT envisions a future where
    the sensing, processing, and networking capabilities of a smart environment will
    require little or no human intervention. Energy efficiency is a major concern
    in such smart environments with battery-operated sensors and devices. The introduction
    of 5G networks, with its improved speed, reliability, and reduced latency, will
    have a major impact on the IIoT. The increased number of interconnected IIoT devices
    enables more advanced applications and better real-time data analysis, both of
    which are made possible by the vast device connectivity made possible by 5G. Long
    range wide area network (LoRaWAN) is well-known in IoT-enabled communication networking
    systems along with new trends of IoT applications such as monitoring healthcare,
    building home automation, manufacturing industries and so on. Cheikh et al. [32]
    performed systematic research on important search engines to accurately explain
    LoRaWAN technology and effective energy usage in IoT devices. Specifically, the
    importance of power consumption in LoRaWAN networks was highlighted in this research,
    while emphasizing the specific characteristics of the network that are attributed
    to specific layers. The work also discussed popular issues related to energy efficacy
    at different layers, such as the medium access control layer and the network layer
    of the LoRa standard. This study aimed to provide a review of pioneering research
    and provide insights into optimizing LoRaWAN technology from both a network and
    device perspective. 5.3. Security and safety of industrial IoT devices IIoT networks
    are usually larger in scale compared to a few devices in consumer IoT deployments.
    Security and safety are thus becoming more crucial as the number of IIoT uses
    increases. The increased and dynamic interconnection between IIoT devices makes
    the network architecture more complex. So, it is essential to have a profound
    understanding of the weaknesses to establish security in current consumer IoT.
    It is important to consider the specific requirements from an industry standards
    viewpoint to ensure a secure networked IIoT ecosystem and ensure the coverage
    of the connectivity protocols is specified to meet security and safety standards
    [7]. The wireless ecosystem of IIoT services has been relatively popular with
    industrial-centric features in the current 5G architecture. Different aspects
    of the IIoT-edge-cloud ecosystem, such as transformative technologies, (non) real-time
    offloading, and data analytics were discussed. There are research challenges associated
    with the emerging design trends that must be dealt with in the future to create
    value-centric industrial wireless networks. Protecting sensitive data, preventing
    illegal access, and ensuring the integrity of industrial operations should be
    prioritised in future IIoT systems. Examples include new forms of encryption,
    authentication systems, and even anomaly detection algorithms. Since IoT devices
    are commonly used in different areas, especially in manufacturing, they have become
    the core part of the Industry 4.0 ecosystem. IIoT devices experience exposure
    common to standard IoT devices, such as potentially becoming the origins of cyber
    or physical threats in industrial environments. Jiang et al. [33] presented experimental
    research on the possible threats of a representative device in this area. They
    identified the attack surfaces of an IoT-embedded system with typically used devices
    in this field. An analysis of the security related issues of the current IIoT
    technologies was also performed, whereas the analysis highly emphasized the vulnerability
    of recent production systems. Some possible mitigation strategies to prevent unexpected
    scenarios were recommended in the paper for further research in IIoT. However,
    the major drawbacks of this work were a lack of analysis of the insecure server
    interface, privacy concerns, buffer overflow related defects, and inadequate consideration
    of system security. An effective security strategy is required to secure automatic
    operation and avoid intermediate intrusions in IIoT. Some common considerations
    associated with security requirements in IIoTs are the ensuring of restrictions
    against unlicensed access, or the use of industrial machines and maintaining validity
    and integrity for third party operations. Defending against sabotage attacks that
    cause physical damage is also a major goal for a secure IIoT network. 5.4. Coexistence
    and interoperability Coexistence and interoperability are highly significant for
    verifying that IoT devices or wireless networks are operating accurately in a
    massive IIoT ecosystem. There are different systems or devices that need to access
    and transmit data between one another and, essentially, make use of that data
    in a centralized way. Enabling the coexistence and interoperability of different
    types of devices in a system is important for realizing and examining the full
    potential of the IoT system. These advantages are required extensively in a dense
    environment like an IIoT network. Researchers have been studying time sensitive
    networking (TSN), where supported TSN features from specific devices can perform
    well in a TSN environment. Therefore, ensuring coexistence and interoperability
    is one of the challenges that must be addressed in IIoT technologies in the near
    future. However, along with the opportunities that IoT provides to the industry,
    there are also challenges related to real-time operation, energy consumption,
    coexistence, interoperability, and security. Since the requirements of coexistence
    and interoperability are important characteristics in IoT-facilitated 5G networks,
    the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) is requisite to deal with the
    huge volumes of data created by the massive IoT devices. AI-based methods are
    capable of extracting patterns from the data, making meaningful interpretations
    of it and recommending actions to the end devices. While discussing the existing
    challenges and necessary solutions based on IoT and 5G enabling technologies,
    Javaid et al. [34] focused on the demands for AI in future IoT-based 5G network
    systems. The integration of AI at the fog nodes near the end devices was discussed
    in order to minimize energy dissipation, optimize communication latency, improve
    link capacity, and enhance the security of the overall network. The rapid progress
    of IoT devices, ensuring coexistence and interoperability to handle the massive
    amounts of heterogeneous data generated, has become the most important part of
    developing intelligent applications and services. Pliatsios et al. [35] attempted
    to define the problems related to interoperability in IoT-enabled intelligent
    systems and then discussed the latest developments on this subject. They presented
    the unresolved issues and challenges in this context and proposed a framework
    design that employs different methods to enhance interoperability simultaneously
    at all levels. But the major drawbacks of their proposed framework are that the
    ontologies they created are complex and not interoperable with each other. Further,
    they did not emphasize the ontology tools and solutions that can radically improve
    interoperability levels. Moreover, the drawbacks of IoT systems, including limitations
    of resources, energy consumption, and mobility were not considered in this work.
    Finally, their study discussed some insightful ideas for future research and proposed
    solutions to achieve interoperability that introduces the concept of a “Social
    Network of Things” in IoT systems. The IIoT sector has struggled due to the absence
    of standards and compatibility. Developing and adopting industry-wide standards
    will be prioritized in the future to facilitate easy integration and interoperability
    of various IIoT devices, platforms, and systems. This will make deployment, scaling,
    and communication between parties much simpler. 5.5. Limited research on operational
    technology and ICT convergence According to recent research, IIoT is the outcome
    of a convergence of operational technology (OT) and traditional information and
    communication technologies (ICT). Integrating these two different areas requires
    well-defined and scalable benchmarks and it is also particularly important to
    ensure the security of benchmarks. Otherwise, crucial and valuable operational
    properties can become vulnerable. However, OT has not advanced at the same pace
    as information technology (IT) and there are differences between them. Being aware
    of the differences around technical difficulties and privacy concerns, such as
    the convergence of OT and IT, can be insightful. Further research towards the
    convergence of OT and ICT for process automation have been inspired lately by
    researchers looking into different case scenarios, such as a typical process automation
    factory. There are existing challenges with traditional automation architectures,
    as well as a difference between the existing and future architectures of networking
    systems, which need addressing in future IIoT research. Since IIoT is an emerging
    concept in an automated factory, the factory environment is highly exposed to
    cyber threats and interoperability issues. Dhirani et al. [36] discussed these
    issues in their study regardless of enforcing cybersecurity benchmarks and security
    conventions. Their research also provided insightful guidance on the convergence
    of OT and ICT security architectures with interoperable standards and on mitigating
    the differences between the security standards and controls. Enabling a perception
    of converged cybersecurity benchmarks and reviewing the proper utilization, they
    proposed the necessary directions for securing the heterogeneous production environment,
    dealing with the novel threats associated with cybersecurity, enforcing protection
    at different levels, and providing OT/ICT convergence. This study [36] also provided
    directions to map and implement diverse standards, such as machine-to-machine
    and 5G communication networks, IoT-based ecosystems, cloud and edge computing
    platforms, and mitigating security risks and issues. The challenges faced by IIoT
    and their potential solutions are summarized in Table 2. Table 2. Challenges,
    benefits and potential solutions for IIoT. Challenging issues Issues found in
    Recommendations Potential solutions/remarks Ref. Real-time performance Big data
    processing systems where computing a high volume of data from IoT sensors is required
    The IoT-based sensors can achieve a satisfactory output by collecting and transmitting
    the data with acceptable latency and low computational cost. Introduce a system
    with different sensors that collect accelerometer, gyroscope, temperature, and
    humidity data in real time. [30] IoT-based stream processing Apache NiFi can be
    used as the most acceptable solution for IoT-based applications after performing
    an evaluation with peak stream rates from 100k to 1M. Develop a prototype and
    integrate a distributed stream processing system with IoT for the best stream
    processing results. [37] Controlling IoT-based smart grids and microgrids Standard

    suggested standard for monitoring microgrids. Examine three IoT communication
    protocols to evaluate real-time IoT-based communication extensions in an IoT-enabled
    microgrid. [38] Energy efficiency For the placement and resource allocation of
    resources in UAVs The proposed strategy is capable of improving the transmission
    power efficiency of the devices and the altitudes of vehicles using an optimization
    method. Design and modify an algorithm to assign the subchannels of the devices
    in order to mitigate interference effectively. [39] Developing energy-conscious
    massive access for 5G networks and green cellular standards Energy-conscious enormous
    access in 5G networks and beyond cellular standards in quality of service and
    connection should be investigated. Explanation of how power dissipation at the
    MAC layer affects the battery life of devices in an IoT-facilitated system. [40]
    Using LoRaWAN technology in IoT devices where efficient energy consumption should
    be considered The study reviewed pioneering research and drew insightful conclusions
    about optimizing LoRaWAN technology from both the network prospect and the device
    prospect. Popular issues related to energy efficacy at different layers, such
    as the medium access control layer and the network layer of the LoRa standard,
    must be addressed. [32] Security and safety of industrial IoT devices Manufacturing
    processes in Industrial IoT There must be tighter collaborations between academic
    communities and different industries to raise awareness of the problems they face
    and the constraints to consider while deploying IoT solutions in manufacturing
    processes. Identify the challenges posed and the research opportunities concerning
    scalability, interoperability, and dependability, which are key attributes of
    many distributed systems. [41] Industrial IoT Some possible mitigation strategies
    can be considered for further research to prevent unexpected scenarios. Identify
    the attack surfaces of an embedded system with typically used representative devices
    in this field. [33] Industrial IoT where the security aspects are required Existing
    surveys on the available solutions should be analysed for developing security
    strategies for industrial IoTs and explored some open research problems to flesh
    out the security aspects of this domain. Present a taxonomy of solutions, including
    different approaches related to artificial intelligence, against security issues
    in IIoT ecosystems. [42] Coexistence and interoperability Industrial IoT applications
    with the need for coexistence and interoperability Prospective directions for
    future research are recommended to address IIoT related challenges emerging from
    standardization efforts. Focus on the challenges associated with the need for
    coexistence and interoperability. [43] IoT-based 5G networks AI-integrated fog
    nodes near the end devices can be used to minimize energy dissipation, optimize
    communication latency, improve link capacity, and enhance the security of the
    overall network. Provide insights into the future scope and obstacles related
    to the coexistence and interoperability of incorporating AI in the 5G networking
    of the IoT ecosystem. [34] Developing IoT-based networks Future research and proposed
    solutions need to be identified to achieve interoperability that introduces the
    concept of a “Social Network of Things” in IoT systems. Present the unresolved
    concerns and challenges in this context and present a framework that uses several
    ways to promote interoperability simultaneously at all levels. [35] Limited research
    on OT and ICT convergence IoT-based mining industry A complex IIoT framework that
    meets major IIoT standards allows smart mines with interoperable structures, data
    distribution, and real-time mining status visibility. Identify a key challenge
    regarding vertical fragmentation due to the technical variations in different
    systems and devices. [44] OT/IT-based systems A two-layered message-oriented middleware
    (MoM) configuration can be used, where each layer is designed to the specific
    needs of the OT and ICT levels, respectively. Adopting OPC unified architecture
    as the interoperable layer of the devices and the systems is the most suitable
    approach to achieve the requirements of high-quality services at the OT layer.
    [45] In conclusion, IIoT is a rapidly developing field with numerous prospective
    future directions and developments. Some of the most promising future applications
    of IIoT include edge computing, AI integration, enhanced security measures, standardization
    and interoperability, 5G and connectivity advancements, digital twins and simulation,
    sustainability and energy efficiency, advanced analytics and predictive maintenance.
    For instance, AI technologies, including machine learning and deep learning will
    be essential in the development of IIoT in the future. Data collected by IIoT
    devices can be analysed by AI algorithms to detect anomalies, identify patterns,
    and make insightful predictions. By integrating IIoT with AI, companies may gain
    useful information, optimize techniques, and enhance their operational efficiency.
    Massive volumes of data are produced by IIoT systems, which can be used for analytics
    and predictive servicing. Businesses can identify trends, predict failures of
    equipment, and schedule maintenance with the help of modern analytics methods
    like predictive modeling and machine learning. By taking these measures, downtime
    and maintenance costs can be reduced significantly. 6. Conclusion As a result
    of the benefits IIoT offers, it rapidly became an essential component of the Industry
    4.0 revolution. This research provided a complete overview of the challenges and
    opportunities offered by IIoT-enabled technology and applications for industrial
    growth. The review aimed to contribute to future studies by describing several
    IIoT applications across several fields. Insights from previous IIoT-related research
    have also been summarized to aid in understanding the progress IIoT has made until
    now. The observations of this study have led to major findings, such as: ■ IIoT
    technology has been developed to interconnect all industrial equipment, monitoring,
    and regulating systems, bodily processes, and mechanical controls. These allow
    manufacturers to work more effectively while reducing errors. ■ Although there
    are certain hurdles to utilizing this technology, large industries’ success is
    highly reliant on well-designed IIoT infrastructure. Working efficiently without
    IIoT during the present industrial revolution is therefore unfeasible. ■ A blockchain
    based security framework for the cement industry resolved the 51% security issue
    and Sybil attack that was caused by existing consensus algorithms like PoW, and
    PoC. ■ Fog computing can lower the time spent looking for parking; the platform
    saved time, fuel, and CO2 emissions. ■ Cognitive computing-based intrusion detection
    demonstrated notable performance with an accuracy of 98.45%. ■ A multi-intelligent
    system for water management can save up to 60% of water. ■ A knn-AHP ensemble
    model was performed with 94% accuracy to ensure smart lighting based on environmental
    factors in green buildings. It is essential to do additional research to resolve
    the existing challenges of this technology, as industrial manufacturing processes
    cannot run smoothly without a well-designed network infrastructure. A more advanced
    form of industrial IoT infrastructure is expected to contribute to industrial
    technological advancement in the near future through continuous innovation and
    experimentation. Conflict of interest No authors have disclosed any conflicts

    on Internet of Things (IoT) devices produces clear benefits as it ensures the
    use of accurate data from the initial stage. However, this process poses a challenge
    due to the unique characteristics of IoT. This article presents a Systematic Literature

    In today’s world, the Internet of Things (IoT) plays a significant role in our
    daily lives, connecting different aspects of our environment [1]. Edge Computing
    (EC) is a type of computing used in IoT systems, which enables more efficient
    devices to process data and improve performance near the source [2], [3]. EC has
    several benefits, including faster data processing, lower transfer costs, improved
    information security and privacy, and increased productivity [2], [4]. Sensor-based
    IoT devices generate valuable data that can be used to better understand and manage
    our surroundings, leading to better decision-making, automation and productivity
    [5], [6]. However, low-cost data-generating devices can introduce errors, leading
    to unexpected system behaviour [7]. Detecting anomalies or unexpected states in
    the analysis of IoT data is crucial in domains such as automated operations in
    industries, energy management, healthcare or assisted living [8], [9]. Anomaly
    detection can include the identification of abnormalities, outliers or specific
    events. Several techniques are used for anomaly detection in order to identify
    incorrect data. However, these techniques require significant human involvement
    to activate the systems and comprehend the data produced. Even with minor procedures,
    manually detecting trends can be challenging. It is easier for experts to focus
    on a limited subset of data and manually recognise relevant patterns and trends.
    However, as the number of connected devices increases, the complexity of data
    analysis also increases. Therefore, there is growing interest in developing automated
    methods that allow professionals to concentrate solely on the most significant
    events [10]. Although the IoT realm may be considered relatively new, multiple
    methods are already available for detecting anomalies in both time-series and
    non-temporal data from various domains that can be applied in IoT-specific scenarios.
    Several surveys have explored this topic, including the detection of anomalies
    in time-series data. The early works of Hawkins [11] and Abraham and Chang [12]
    laid the foundation for more comprehensive investigations, such as those conducted
    by Markou and Singh [13], [14], who led a two-part survey exploring statistical
    and Neural Network (NN) approaches. Further methods available in 2009 were analysed
    by Chandola et al. [15], while Zhang et al. [16] discussed approaches that applied
    to early IoT. More recently, Chalapathy and Chawla [17] studied Deep Learning
    (DL) methods in the broader field of anomaly detection, including time series
    in IoT scenarios. Using data-driven analytical procedures efficiently is crucial
    for IoT applications, since various techniques are used to detect anomalies in
    IoT environments, as mentioned in a survey conducted in [18]. Intelligent methods
    such as Big Data or Artificial Intelligence (AI) are used to gain knowledge from
    these data. Machine Learning (ML), a subset of AI, enables machines or IoT devices
    to learn from previous data without explicit programming. ML is critical in building
    intelligent IoT applications, as it uncovers hidden patterns by analysing large
    volumes of data using sophisticated algorithms, according to [19]. Smart IoT devices
    are imperative for optimising and allocating resources, performing real-time data
    analysis and making decisions. These techniques fall under three broad categories:
    statistical, ML and DL. Statistical methods include Dissimilarity Measures, Bayesian,
    Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)
    and Correlation-based methods. ML techniques include Support Vector Machine (SVM),
    Regression models, Reinforcement Learning (RL), Decision Trees, NN and others.
    The DL methods identified are Convolutional NN (CNN) and Autoencoder models. In
    recent years, IoT devices have become more powerful and capable of performing
    complex computational tasks [20]. This advancement has opened up opportunities
    to run advanced algorithms on the network edge [21]. Conducting data analysis
    and ML operations at the network edge helps prevent delays when transferring data
    from the source to the cloud, resulting in faster computation times [22]. Combining
    AI capabilities with IoT devices has led to the concept of Artificial Intelligence
    of Things (AIoT) [23]. In a conventional IoT architecture, ML-related tasks are
    typically performed on the cloud side, which can result in high latency and less-than-desirable
    Quality of Service (QoS) [24]. IoT devices collect the data and then send them
    to the cloud layer for analysis, with ML algorithms applied. This limits the real-time
    analytics capabilities of the system. Additionally, there are also privacy, security
    and bandwidth challenges [25], [26], [27]. TinyML addresses these issues by applying
    ML algorithms on low-power devices such as MicroController Units (MCUs) with limited
    memory and processing resources. In recent times, TinyML has emerged as a new
    trend that involves integrating ML techniques into small, low-power devices powered
    by MCUs [28]. The significance of TinyML lies in its ability to use powerful algorithms
    in battery-powered devices, thereby enabling real-time data processing and improving
    responsiveness while reducing the energy consumption required for wireless communications.
    As a result, this technology is expected to undergo exponential growth in the
    coming years and gain widespread acceptance [29]. Different reviews have been
    conducted on anomaly detection techniques. The first study was [30], where authors
    analysed anomaly detection work using different techniques such as statistics,
    classification, clustering, or information theoretic. Another review [31] focused
    on anomaly detection techniques using DL. In the same study, a hierarchical taxonomy
    was proposed, classifying deep anomaly detection methods into three main categories
    and 11 detailed categories based on the modelling perspective. With the emergence
    of the IoT realm, more focused revisions have appeared to the data produced by
    these devices. For instance, [32] analysed algorithms and approaches to detect
    anomalies in time series data generated by IoT devices. Lastly, [33] presented
    a summary of detection methods and applications, discussing the categorisation
    of IoT anomaly detection algorithms. This paper presents a comprehensive Systematic
    Literature Mapping (SLM) on ML and DL in AIoT, specifically focusing on their
    ability to detect anomalies. The review follows the Preferred Reporting Items
    for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodology [34]. Unlike previous
    works, this review analyses the use of anomaly detection techniques in the AIoT
    paradigm, which involves applying these models in embedded IoT devices (MCUs)
    and using edge computing. Additionally, the review was conducted methodically
    following the PRISMA guidelines, which ensure a systematic and replicable approach
    for reporting systematic reviews and meta-analyses [35]. The survey covers the
    following key contributions: (a) studying techniques for anomaly detection in
    ML/DL and validation metrics used in the AIoT; (b) analysing data used in the
    estimation of models; (c) showing how ML is applied to EC using hardware or software;
    (d) investigating the main microcontrollers, types of power supply and communication
    technology; and (e) developing a taxonomy of ML/DL algorithms used for detection
    anomalies based on TinyML. Finally, the benefits and challenges of this kind of
    TinyML analysis are described. The paper is organised as follows. In Section 2,
    we introduce the main concepts to provide a context for the review. Section 3
    explains the methodology used to achieve this systematic review of the literature.
    Next, Section 4 presents the results of our analysis. In Section 5, we discuss
    the benefits and challenges of using TinyML in the detection of anomalies. Section
    6 defines a roadmap for anomaly detection in MCU. Finally, we offer our conclusions
    in Section 7. 2. Background and concepts This section serves as an introductory
    overview, elucidating key concepts essential for comprehending the intricacies
    of the present study. 2.1. Internet of Things and edge computing In 1999, Kevin
    Ashton introduced the concept of IoT. IoT is a network of intelligent objects
    that allows the sharing of information and resources, while adapting to changes
    in the environment and being self-organising [36]. With IoT, smart devices can
    connect to the Internet and serve various domains, discussed in [37] and analysed
    in [38]. These applications are classified into three categories: smart city,
    industry and health. In a typical IoT architecture (as presented in Fig. 1), IoT
    devices with limited computing capabilities are located at the lower level (EC).
    This layer comprises basic sensors/actuators and smart devices [1]. Basic sensors
    and actuators lack computing or Internet Protocol (IP) connectivity capabilities,
    requiring higher-level devices to establish links. Smart devices can store and
    process measurements and use their computing power (EC). Distributed devices with
    greater capacity than smart devices are placed in the intermediate layer, or Fog
    Computing (FC). These Fog devices maintain communication and data flow captured
    from IoT devices and temporarily store data in a local cloud. The data are processed
    and analytical processes can be performed in real time. Traditional cloud services
    store data and manage all devices in the upper layer. When computing is carried
    out at the edge of the network to manage downstream data for cloud services and
    upstream data for IoT services, it is known as EC [2]. The term “Edge” refers
    to network resources that are located close to users or data sources [2], [40].
    EC addresses the issue of high network latency in applications and services that
    are sensitive to lags in Cloud Computing (CC) [41]. EC boosts data security by
    performing computer downloads, data storage and information processing close to
    the user and in near real time. AI applications are increasing in IoT environments
    due to EC, where semantic web, ML/DL, and data mining technologies are commonly
    used to leverage the computational power of EC [42]. Download : Download high-res

    defined in [39]. 2.2. Machine learning and deep learning Experts in the field
    note that ML involves the study of computational algorithms that gain experience
    by making decisions and predictions [43], [44]. By analysing and processing data,
    intelligent systems can be created [45] that adapt to changing circumstances [46].
    These algorithms use mathematical concepts such as statistics, optimisation and
    probability to operate effectively [43]. ML algorithms can be categorised into
    three groups: (1) supervised learning algorithms that predict the label of an
    object based on its characteristics and predefined class labels; (2) unsupervised
    learning algorithms that generate classification labels without predefined classes;
    and (3) RL algorithms that learn from real-world events and receive rewards or
    penalties based on their decisions [46], [47], [48]. DL algorithms are a form
    of ML that aims to model complex patterns in data prediction using multilayer
    information processing modules [49], [50]. The term “deep” refers to the numerous
    hidden layers that make up the NN [49]. The rise of DL can be attributed to advancements
    in ML algorithms, increased processing power, affordable hardware and the availability
    of large datasets [49], [50], [51]. Like ML algorithms, DL can be classified as
    supervised, unsupervised or RL algorithms [52]. According to research conducted
    by [50], [53], [54], there are four main categories of DL algorithms. The first
    category is CNN, primarily used for computer vision and image recognition. It
    comprises convolution and subsampling layers (pooling) and uses the convolution
    operation to learn higher-order characteristics. The second category is Recurrent
    NN (RNN), commonly used for time-series problems. RNNs use sequential information
    to learn patterns in the data and do not have a defined layer structure, allowing
    arbitrary connections between neurons. The third category is Autoencoder algorithms,
    which encode a dataset, reducing its dimensionality while simultaneously learning
    how to reconstruct it. Finally, there is the Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM),
    a stochastic and generative NN capable of learning representations and solving
    combinatorial problems. AI models are generated through training and testing steps.
    This involves exposing them to vast amounts of data, including images and values.
    Through repetition and the analysis of massive databases, AI learns the characteristics
    of these elements and generates a model. This model is typically uploaded to a
    cloud server for a production stage. However, EC improves this process by generating
    a copy of the ML model in each IoT device where data is generated. This means
    that the information does not have to travel to the cloud server for each model
    iteration. This approach improves the speed of detecting manufacturing faults
    and significantly reduces traffic and bandwidth requirements. Although EC allows
    for ML/DL models on devices, powerful algorithms such as Deep NN (DNNs) require
    significant computing power. In such cases, a technique is employed where some
    calculations are offloaded to devices with higher processing capabilities [55].
    IoT devices transmit data to the closest server, typically located in the fog,
    which receives the results after performing the model [56]. A common approach
    to minimising data redundancy on devices is to send essential data. For example,
    in image analysis models with substantial data volume, IoT devices filter important
    frames and exclusively transmit them to the server. For more complex solutions,
    hierarchical structures with different computing capabilities at various levels
    of devices are also used. This architecture operates synchronously and divides
    tasks to cover DNN hyperparameters. The deployment process for a TinyML application
    is depicted in Fig. 2. The design can be separated into two parts: the conventional
    data science environment and the IoT context (TinyML). The first part contains
    the standard steps for traditional ML/DL algorithms, such as data collection,
    algorithm selection, model building, and optimisation. The second part, which
    is focused on TinyML, includes the model deployment and porting stages. To create
    a TinyML model, it is necessary to choose an effective algorithm and gather the
    required data. This can be achieved by using precompiled datasets or collecting
    data from real-time sensors. As usual, the input data is split into two subsets:
    training (a) and test (b). The model generation process (c) is iterative, as the
    model needs to be regenerated (f) based on the evaluation (d) of the metrics (using
    the test dataset [e]). Once all the requirements have been met, the model learning
    process can begin on an IoT device. The final stages of a TinyML system are porting
    and deployment (g,h). When integrating a model, it must be converted into an MCU-friendly
    language. TinyML interpreters, such as Tensorflow Lite Micro, are used to convert
    a model created in a suitable scripting language to a frozen graph that is optimally
    represented as a C array. Finally, the ported model is incorporated into a microcontroller,
    where inference (j) is performed on sensor data (i) using the base ML process.
    The results obtained can be useful for further improving the model (k). Download

    TinyML workflow. 2.3. Anomaly detection Several attempts have been made to describe
    anomalous data. According to Hawkins, an outlier is an observation that differs
    so much from other observations that it raises the suspicion that it was generated
    by a different mechanism [11]. Alternatively, Barnett and Lewis defined an outlier
    as an observation (or a subset of observations) that seems inconsistent with the
    rest of the dataset [57]. An anomaly in the context of the IoT refers to the measurable
    effects of an unexpected change in the state of a system that deviates from its
    usual behaviour, either locally or globally. This definition highlights some crucial
    points about the nature of IoT data. First, most of the information obtained from
    an IoT system is “normal” and represents the typical characteristics of that particular
    system. Secondly, the definition recognises that the notion of normal system operations
    can evolve over time due to various factors. They can be categorised into three
    types (Fig. 3): • Point anomalies: the occurrence of an observation in the data
    that does not conform to the normal pattern of the data is a point anomaly. Point
    anomalies are individual in nature. • Contextual anomalies: these refer to instances
    in the data that deviate from normal observations of the data in the context in
    which the data are being collected. Such instances could be normal values in one
    context, but in another they might be anomalous; hence, they are context-related.
    • Collective or pattern anomalies: these are defined as a collection of data observations
    that do not adhere to the normal pattern of the data. As the name suggests, such
    an anomaly type is collective in nature, and an individual point in such anomalies
    might not be an anomaly. Various techniques and algorithms have been developed
    to detect anomalies in time series data [58]. While some methods may combine elements
    from different approaches, they can generally be classified into the following
    categories. The choice of technique is highly dependent on various factors present
    in the monitored data and the environment in which the anomaly detector will be
    used. Anomaly detection methods fall into several categories. Statistical and
    probabilistic methods construct a model from historical data, identifying anomalies
    when new observations deviate from this model [14]. Pattern matching creates a
    direct model of the time series, comparing new observations to a database of labelled
    anomalies in supervised settings [59]. Distance-based methods use specific metrics
    to compare previous and new observations, flagging deviations as anomalies [60].
    Clustering projects data into multidimensional space, considering data points
    close to dense clusters as normal and flagging others as anomalous [61]. Predictive
    models generate regression models based on recent trends, considering a data point
    anomalous if it significantly differs from predicted values [62]. Ensemble methods
    use multiple algorithms and a voting mechanism for anomaly detection, enhancing
    accuracy but increasing complexity and computational time [63]. Download : Download

    of the three existing types of anomalies. 3. Systematic literature mapping methodology
    When conducting a SLM, a strict methodology is followed to obtain reliable data
    that can be used to address research issues. This ensures that the review is quantifiable,
    reproducible, systematic, clearly stated and comprehensive with respect to a specific
    topic [64]. We conducted a systematic review of the literature using the PRISMA
    methodology [34], which includes a detailed checklist that other researchers can
    use to replicate the review process and collect precise data for future research.
    Although PRISMA is commonly used in the medical and physical sciences [65], it
    is still in the experimental phase of computer science research. However, using
    a PRISMA-based approach in an SLM ensures the quality of the review, allows the
    reader to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the research and provides a
    reference point for other professionals in the field. It also makes it easier
    to replicate the review methods, structure and format using PRISMA. Overall, the
    PRISMA methodology ensures the accuracy and reliability of SLMs. We used the PRISMA
    technique to assess the existing evidence. Our aim was to examine the possibility
    of implementing anomaly detection approaches on limited embedded devices (MCUs)
    located at the edge of the network. The process of conducting this review of the
    literature is depicted in Fig. 4. Defining the research questions is a vital aspect
    of any research. It helps to address specific issues and to ensure that biases
    are avoided by being concise and transparent. As the researchers stated in [66],
    defining the research issue is the most critical part of a systematic mapping
    study. The process of formulating research questions aims to identify the primary
    studies that will be analysed and determine the data that will be extracted to
    address these questions. Lastly, the development of the mapping involves the implementation
    of the protocol. Download : Download high-res image (306KB) Download : Download

    3.1. PICOC The authors in [67] suggest using the PICOC (Population, Intervention,
    Comparison, Outcome, Context) medical guideline when constructing study questions.
    The terms “Population” and “Intervention” refer to the group of elements under
    investigation, “Comparison” pertains to the intervention that was previously specified,
    “Outcome” indicates the expected results, and “Context” denotes the area of the
    study to which the intervention is applied and investigated. Table 1 displays
    the PICOC terms defined for the current research. In this study, we are particularly
    interested in exploring the use of AI algorithms in IoT devices, specifically
    TinyML and MCU. We aim to use ML/DL algorithms to detect anomalies in these devices.
    Due to the nature of our intervention, we were unable to compare them. The results
    of our study include various solutions, techniques, approaches and developments.
    Our focus is solely on fog/cloud solutions when ML/DL algorithms are applied to
    EC within an IoT environment. Table 1. Definition of PICOC terms of the Systematic

    we can now formulate and clarify the research questions that this study aims to
    answer. In their publication [68], the authors highlighted the importance of having
    precise and focused research enquiries. As a basis for this mapping study, we
    have compiled a list of Mapping Questions (MQs), which can be seen in Table 2.
    Table 2. List of Mapping Questions on the research. No Question MQ1 How many studies
    have been published over the years, and how was this distribution constructed?
    MQ2 Which ML/DL techniques are applied to detect anomalies through TinyML? MQ3

    are used for investigation? MQ5 Which IoT devices (MCU) are used by the researchers?
    MQ6 Which IoT conditions in terms of power and connectivity are used? MQ7 In which
    use cases and domains are they applied? 3.2.1. Inclusion/exclusion criteria The
    objective of using inclusion and rejection criteria is to identify research papers
    that address the research questions. We have listed the inclusion standards to
    find the source documents in Table 3. As exclusion criteria are the opposite of
    inclusion criteria, we have not included them here. Table 3. Inclusion criteria
    used in the research. No. Inclusion criteria IC1 Articles that propose a research/empirical
    study and apply an ML/DL algorithm to detect anomalies; IC2 Articles that apply
    an ML/DL algorithm on the EC layer; IC3 Articles that necessarily have a title,
    abstract and keywords; IC4 Articles published in English; IC5 Articles published
    at peer-review events, such as journals, conferences or workshops. 3.3. Search
    strategy This subsection outlines the core elements of our research methodology,
    including string search and strategic academic library selection. 3.3.1. Sources
    After describing the PICOC components, the research queries and the inclusion/exclusion
    criteria, we list the source libraries used to search. The four academic libraries
    chosen were ACM Digital Library, Web of Science, IEEExplore and Scopus. They were
    chosen based on the following criteria: (i) they are the main databases related
    to the subject of the review and with the best reputation; (ii) the ability to
    conduct searches using logical characters (such as “AND” and “OR”); and (iii)
    the ability to conduct searches in the document’s body and metadata fields (such
    as the title, keywords and abstract). 3.3.2. String search Table 4 presents a
    list of the commonly used keywords included in the search to locate the papers
    that apply ML/DL models to detect anomalies in the context of TinyML or AIoT.
    The population displayed on PICOC, which consists of two elements, is included
    in the string search with all combinations (acronyms and complete words). The
    intervention described in Section 3.1 is referenced in the second sentence, which
    alludes to the element that concerns the investigation. The terms of the Outcomes
    are not included in order to get more results. The last line of the string refers
    to the specific context we are investigating. The term “Internet of Things” is
    also included in the subsets “TinyML” and “AIoT” to produce more relevant results
    for primary queries. Therefore, adding “IoT” to the initial search is unnecessary.
    This selection step is carried out over the whole of the step involving the reading
    of the paper, where only papers that present this kind of result will be added.
    Table 4. Search string used in the research. No. Search terms 1 “tinyml“ OR “tiny

    process The data extraction method has four main stages. Fig. 5 illustrates the
    key stages. Although we set all the libraries to search using only the metadata
    fields (title, keywords and abstract), we were able to search the ACM library
    using a field called “Anywhere”. Thus, we searched through all the documents and
    did not set a year limit due to the newness of this study. A total of 162 papers
    were found in the four scientific paper databases. The survey shows that 18 research
    studies were approved for an in-depth analysis. We obtained the most recent findings
    within the last three years and excluded papers that were irrelevant to the scope
    covered by our study. We then identified and eliminated 55 duplicated files. After
    applying our exclusion criteria in the third step, we finally ended up with 89
    articles. We performed a thorough examination of all the information, including
    keywords, titles and abstracts, using our inclusion/exclusion criteria. Finally,
    we obtained a set of 18 articles that addressed the subject matter of our research
    and conducted a more detailed review. Data extracted from each study include the
    type of publication (journal, conference, or book chapter), authors and their
    institutions, the country of publication, the study abstract, keywords, the URL
    and ISBN/ISSN/DOI of the publication (see dataset published in Zenodo [69]). The
    searches were conducted on 29 March 2023. Download : Download high-res image (253KB)

    4. Systematic literature mapping report Following the identification of the bounded
    papers, we can present the detailed results of the SLM. The thorough analysis
    and classification of the 18 primary studies were conducted to address the mapping
    questions outlined in Section 3.2. 4.1. Selected studies The complete findings
    of SLM obtained from the appropriate papers that were selected can be seen in
    Table 5. To answer the mapping-related questions discussed in Section 3.2, a thorough
    analysis and categorisation of the 18 studies was carried out. The analysed papers
    are divided into two groups: those that employ data from IoT sensors and those
    that use network data. The first group, application data, pertains to processed
    IoT sensor data that serve various industries such as healthcare and smart cities.
    On the other hand, network telemetry data are monitored to ensure the IoT network’s
    health. A brief description of each work selected based on this categorisation
    is presented below. Table 5. Extracted features from selected papers. Paper Domain

    A) No Single A framework proposed by [70] applies Complex Event Processing (CEP)
    reasoning rules to sensor data in an industrial environment using EC devices.
    The approach uses a CNN, an Autoencoder NN, and multiple CEP rules on two Arduino
    Nano 33 Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) boards. Meanwhile, [72] uses vibration data
    from sensors placed on industrial machines and analyses them using lightweight
    CNNs on a Raspberry Pi single-board microcontroller and perimeter inference on
    the ESP32 board. Furthermore, [83] presents an approach to detect anomalies in
    vibration data using an ARM Cortex-M4 microcontroller and an Autoencoder algorithm.
    Another industrial application for anomaly detection can be found in [77], which
    aims to detect abnormal values in the behaviour of submersible pumps by monitoring
    elements such as bearings, fans or similar equipment. This method uses Tiny-MLOps
    methodologies and an unsupervised ML technique capable of detecting anomalies.
    Lastly, the study in [82] presents an anomaly detection technique based on Sparse
    and Random NN for industrial quality inspection and predictive maintenance tasks.
    In the industrial domain, some studies utilise camera-captured images to detect
    anomalies. One such system is presented in [75], which uses three cameras (OpenMV
    Cam H7 Plus) to detect artefacts and anomalies in plastic components automatically.
    The data processing is performed locally using TinyML with the CNN algorithm.
    Another system, described in [86], focuses on part recognition and defect inspection.
    The system is tested using a DNN algorithm and a platform of eight high-performance
    edge devices (Nvidia Jetson Nano) and eight low-performance devices (Raspberry
    Pi 4B). Finally, in [88], the authors proposed a scenario for a wastewater management
    plant, where a device runs an unsupervised anomaly detection algorithm based on
    ML to autonomously learn the expected behaviour of the industrial pump being monitored
    without relying on any external component. Regarding energy consumption, [73]
    proposed a novel embedded solution to detect and diagnose anomalies for photovoltaic
    power generation systems. A fault detection and diagnosis algorithm based on Deep
    CNN (DCNN) and thermographic images has been developed and integrated into a Raspberry
    Pi 4 board. [80] proposed two different scenarios related to energy consumption
    where EC could be applied, including anomaly detection for Industry 4.0 based
    on a Hybrid Binary Automatic Encoder (HBAE). It uses two microcontrollers from
    the STM32 family. The authors of [87] introduced a Typicality and Eccentricity
    Data Analytics (TEDA) algorithm to detect anomalies in data streams. This TinyML
    algorithm uses the concepts of typicality and eccentricity to achieve this. It
    is implemented through an OBD-II interface (On-Board diagnostics) and the Freematics
    ONE+ (ESP32) device, providing information on CO2 emissions. The field of health
    has seen significant application of AIoT. In a study by [71], an anomaly detection
    system was proposed for the Diabetes Management Control System (DMCS) using the
    Federated Learning-assisted CNN model. A Raspberry Pi device was used to provide
    patient care and maintain the normal range of glucose concentration in the body.
    Similarly, [78] discussed the use of microcontrollers with integrated Micro Electro-Mechanical
    System (MEMS) sensors in a real-life healthcare scenario. Adapted CNN models were
    employed to reduce power consumption. A recent study [79] explored the use of
    AI to predict and detect anomalies in personal protective equipment. Helmets,
    bracelets and belts are equipped with sensors to collect data, which are then
    used to train models like CNN or Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). A multisensory
    bracelet with an ESP32 microcontroller has also been developed to monitor the
    health of workers on construction sites, power plants and power lines [81]. LSTM
    models are used to detect anomalous readings. AIoT technology has been used in
    the field of surveillance. A research study, referenced as [76], introduced a
    reliable and effective framework for identifying irregularities in extensive surveillance
    video data. The proposed model combines 2D-CNN and Echo State Network (ESN) for
    intelligent surveillance. CNN is employed as a feature extractor from input videos,
    which are then refined by the automatic encoder for feature enhancement, followed
    by ESN for sequence learning and detection of anomalous events. An area where
    AI-powered technology has been implemented is in smart agriculture. Researchers
    at [85] have developed an AIoT monitoring system to monitor plant growth and identify
    nutrient deficiencies in indoor crops, such as lettuce. To achieve this, they
    used a DL algorithm to analyse images of hydroponic growth boxes and evaluate
    each lettuce plant individually. Finally, in the second group, telemetry data
    from IoT device networks is used. In a study conducted by [84], they suggested
    using EC and small ML to classify network traffic and detect unusual behaviour.
    The same authors used TensorFlow Lite to transform a conventional CNN into a compact
    ML model that runs on an edge device. It is crucial to provide anomaly detection
    systems for Cyber–Physical Systems (CPS), and [74] achieved this by combining
    a One-Class Support Vector Machines (OCSVM) model with a Pairwise Self-supervised
    LSTM (PSLSTM) model. 4.2. Studies distribution Fig. 6 shows the initial result
    of the searches carried out, in which the number of articles per year and academic
    library appear. We were able to identify 18 research papers that used ML/DL algorithms
    for anomaly detection on MCU following the steps described in Fig. 5. These papers
    were published between 2021 and 2023 and, despite the topic being relatively new,
    there has been a consistent increase in publications every year. The number of
    publications has doubled every year, with more than 77% of them published in the
    last two years. Although our search was conducted in March 2023, a substantial
    number of articles were published during the first months of this year. Furthermore,
    Fig. 7 shows the number of publications for each year. Based on the data presented
    in Fig. 7, it can be seen that ISI Web of Science has the highest number of articles
    in the digital repository. In this source, seven studies account for 38.88% of
    the total number of articles selected. Of the chosen articles, 13 were published
    in journals and five were presented at conferences. Most of the selected articles
    (40%) were published in Sensors (MDPI), with six studies, while Future Generation
    Computer Systems had two articles, representing 66.66% of the journal papers.

    are applied to detect anomalies through TinyML In the studies conducted, a total
    of 12 algorithms were used. Fig. 9 shows the percentage distribution of the most
    commonly used algorithms. CNN was the algorithm used most frequently, accounting
    for 18.8% of the studies. Autoencoder, LSTM, DNN, Isolation Forest, and Gaussian
    Mixture Model (GMM) followed closely behind, with percentages of 13.6% each. Conversely,
    Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), RNN, DCNN, TEDA, Hybrid Binary NN (HyBNN), and Locality
    Sensitive Hashing (LSH) were the least used algorithms, with only 4.55% each.
    If we classify the algorithms according to their typology, we can see that 42.86%
    were unsupervised, 52.36% were supervised and 4.76% were semi-supervised. After
    examining the libraries and frameworks used in developing the techniques mentioned
    above, we have found a total of seven different options (see Fig. 10). The most
    commonly used library is TensorFlow, in any of its versions. The traditional version
    has been used four times, each time requiring a high-performance hardware device
    such as Raspberry PI (three occurrences) or Nvidia Jetson Nano (one occurrence).
    The TensorFlow Lite version has also been used four times, with a wide range of
    devices including ESP32, Arduino, Wio and Raspberry Pi. The second most popular
    option is MicroPython, which has been used twice, always in conjunction with a
    microcontroller of the ESP32 family. The TinyOL framework was adopted once by
    Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense. The Scipy and Scikit-learn libraries were used only
    once, and on high-performance hardware such as Raspberry Pi. Finally, in the work
    cited in [80], an implementation was made without any external library, programmed
    in C for the ESP32 microcontroller. Download : Download high-res image (287KB)

    for anomaly detection Based on the selected research studies, the Inertial Measurement
    Unit (IMU) is the most widely used data type to detect anomalies in TinyML applications,
    accounting for 20% of the cases. Images and temperature data are each used in
    16.7% of the studies. Vibration and pulse data contribute to 13.3% and 6.67%,
    respectively, for anomaly detection in embedded systems. Other data types, such
    as body glucose level (3.33%), energy (3.33%), bearing (3.33%), humidity (3.33%),
    proximity (3.33%), pressure (3.33%), sound (3.33%) and network traffic, are less
    frequently used. Fig. 11 illustrates the distribution of these data types. Upon
    analysis of the source of data used in 12 works, it has been discovered that some
    studies employed their own datasets. Other studies, however, used previously published
    datasets such as CWRU (in two papers), IMS, UCE, ShanghaiTech, MNIST, FashionMNIST,
    CIFAC10 (in two articles) and NEU64. Download : Download high-res image (322KB)

    applied methods are listed in Fig. 12. The chart displays the frequency of the
    metrics employed in various publications. Accuracy (ACC) was the most frequently
    used metric in eight publications. To assess the model’s reliability, the F1-Score
    was used in five articles. Precision and recall were tested in three articles,
    while Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Area Under the Curve (AUC) were tested
    in two articles, and Mean Squared Error (MSE), Coefficient of Determination (R2),
    specificity and sensitivity were tested in one work. The authors did not disclose
    the metrics used to validate their models in seven articles. Download : Download

    the distribution of the IoT devices used in the studies. Of the 18 studies, eight
    (42.1%) used Raspberry Pi as the processing system to deploy TinyML models, making
    Raspberry Pi the most used MCU system. It should be noted that almost all existing
    Raspberry Pi models have been used, including Raspberry PI 1, 2B, 3B, 3B + (two
    papers), 4 and 4B (two papers). The Arduino microcontroller was used in three
    papers (15.8%), and the Nano BLE 33 version was used in all of them. The ESP32
    microcontroller was also employed in three different research studies; in two,
    the ESP32 DevKit V4 version was chosen and in one, the V1 version. Nvidia Jetson
    Nano (10.5%), STM32 (10.5%), WIO (5.26%) were used in two and one papers, respectively.
    The versions STM32F401RE and STM32H743 of STM32 have been used in the same study
    [75]. Download : Download high-res image (243KB) Download : Download full-size

    The connectivity used to transfer the results of the ML/DL model depends on the
    type of microcontroller, since each supports a different kind of connectivity
    (Fig. 14). Nine of the research studies (47.36%) use wireless connectivity, five
    of them use Wi-Fi, three relies on Bluetooth, and one does not specify the type
    of wireless connectivity. Regarding wired connectivity, one study indicates that
    it uses USB and another uses Ethernet. A total of eight papers do not indicate
    the type of connectivity used. Concerning the power supply of IoT devices, only
    five research studies indicate that they are connected to the energy source by
    cable. None of the research studies refer to the use of batteries as a power source.

    IoT and AI are destined to be the perfect symbiosis. As a data generator, the
    IoT produces the amount of data needed to feed the ML models, and ML techniques
    increase the potential of the IoT by making it smarter and generating decisions
    based on the data provided by the devices. As can be seen in Fig. 6, the topic
    of anomaly detection using TinyML is in a moment of splendour, despite the fact
    that TinyML is still in its preterm ages. In a few years, the number of articles
    published has undergone an exponential growth. This increase is largely due to
    technical advances in IoT and MCU, particularly, new hardware developments enable
    remarkable performance by allowing small local servers or microdata centres to
    be integrated into IoT devices [90]. TinyML allows us to run ML/DL models in the
    same place where the data is generated or the decision must be applied. The purpose
    is to enable IoT devices to be autonomous in decision-making, and not just messengers
    that deliver information to the control centre. The utilisation of TinyML for
    anomaly detection is advantageous in IoT devices, as it can detect potential issues
    in the data quickly, thus avoiding them from spreading during the subsequent stages
    of data analysis and boost prompt decisions (e.g. image and voice recognition).
    Anomaly detection with TinyML models is successfully employed in a variety of
    areas, such as health, agriculture, industry, and the environment. TinyML is motivated
    by the need to incorporate intelligence into a wide range of applications that
    were previously not feasible due to the computing and energy demands of traditional
    ML models. Here are some of the benefits that TinyML provides. TinyML models are
    advantageous due to their ability to reduce latency, as they can be executed directly
    on the device. Processing data locally is much quicker than sending it to the
    cloud, especially when the data is substantial (e.g. pictures or videos). Moreover,
    TinyML systems provide high precision in their models, with only a minor decrease
    [91]. These discoveries show the capability of TinyML to reduce latency and keep
    up model accuracy, making it a desirable choice for deploying ML models on resource-limited
    devices. In the research studies analysed, twelve papers include execution performance
    results to carry out inference. None of them compare making an inference between
    the edge and the cloud. Inference times range from 2 to 534 ms. TinyML is a form
    of ML that is specifically tailored to run on devices with limited computing power,
    such as microcontrollers found in IoT gadgets. The output of the model can be
    used for a variety of purposes, including controlling the device and sending data
    to the fog node or cloud for further analysis. To bring cloud services to the
    local area network, alternative methods for data analysis, such as federated computing
    [92] and EC, have been suggested. These technologies are used to register each
    IoT device on a gateway or fog node, allowing data extraction and processing from
    multiple sensors. In the studies analysed, the most common architecture is to
    apply the TinyML model on the MCU device in isolation. Twelve papers only describe
    the environment of the IoT device, without defining any layer architecture and
    executing the model locally without transferring the result to higher stages.
    Other papers, such as [71], [85], define a multilevel architecture that transfers
    results to higher stages (fog or cloud). Finally, [86] establishes a cluster architecture
    of edge devices, in which they work together to obtain and share the results of
    the models. Although EC and FC provide low latency, the main downside is that
    the wireless connection between the IoT device and the gateway or fog node must
    stay active for complex operations. TinyML models can be executed without an Internet
    connection, while cloud ML models necessitate such a connection. This is particularly
    important for applications deployed in areas without Internet access. Of the studies
    examined, seven do not establish an external connection or provide details about
    it. Six articles provide WiFi connectivity with the IP protocol, while two [78],
    [83] use BLE to connect the device to a gateway. There are also wired works [77],
    [85], which use a USB cable to transfer data. Despite the comprehensive search
    done, there is a noticeable gap in the existing scientific literature concerning
    the utilisation of cutting-edge connectivity technologies, such as Low Power Wide
    Area Network (LoraWAN) or 5G–6G, alongside TinyML. TinyML algorithms offer a major
    advantage in terms of privacy and security. By keeping the data on the device,
    there is no need to send sensitive information to the cloud for processing. This
    has a significant impact on AI ethics, as it guarantees user data privacy, which
    is in line with data protection regulations. Eight articles have been published
    that demonstrate the value of using TinyML techniques to enhance the security
    and privacy of research. Decreasing energy use in TinyML is essential and can
    be achieved by reducing the amount of data that needs to be transported and processed,
    as well as by employing algorithms that are computationally efficient. In addition,
    energy-efficient components, low-voltage and battery-powered operations, and sleep
    or idle modes can help reduce the power requirements of the device. Moreover,
    TinyML models can help to cut down on expenses related to sending data to the
    cloud for processing and storage, such as bandwidth and storage costs. Low energy
    consumption can also lead to cost reductions in TinyML. However, energy consumption
    is not a priority among the studies analysed, as only one provides consumption
    data during execution. Out of the five studies that indicate how they obtain energy,
    all of them directly connect to a source, while none of them use batteries or
    energy-saving techniques, or harvesting techniques via solar panels or other alternative
    sources. Despite the benefits listed above that TinyML brings, its many limitations
    constitute obstacles to its widespread deployment. Some of the limitations of
    TinyML are presented below. As we have seen, the hardware and software used in
    the different studies have great heterogeneity. Among them, we have detected seven
    hardware solutions and seven libraries/frameworks to facilitate the development
    of TinyML models. Because the embedded systems of manufacturing companies do not
    have a generalised method, each company has its own software to adapt the system
    to its devices. Therefore, no standardised method includes software as a framework
    to deploy and run ML/DL models on various devices from different companies without
    drops in accuracy. A generalised framework needs to be developed to increase the
    adoption and awareness of TinyML. The difference in computing power between the
    different edge devices appears along with the heterogeneity of the devices. Currently,
    there are devices with uneven computational characteristics, from devices with
    high performance, such as those that include ARM Cortex processors (Raspberry
    Pi or Nvidia Jetson), to others with lower performance, such as ESP32. Devices
    with higher performance can be considered as small computers with higher consumption.
    These characteristics move them away from more restrictive environments where
    connecting to a light point is impossible. Some IoT devices offer energy-saving
    functionality, and the TinyML philosophy must support this. TinyML models need
    a specific amount of energy to maintain the efficiency of the model at a certain
    level. Given the diversity in their architecture and preprocessing paths, hardware
    modules make it difficult to define a standard power mechanism. As sensors and
    other accessories are typically connected to edge devices, TinyML frames can experience
    poor power handling. Consequently, creating a low-power TinyML system remains
    a major obstacle. At the opposite point, cloud-based systems can process massive
    amounts of data with large DL models. Therefore, the ability to perform these
    data analyses with large amounts of data could be improved by moving from the
    cloud to any device on the edge. Memory is also limited in edge devices, which
    in some cases have only a few KB, and this is one of the main motivations for
    creating TinyML. Traditional DL model inference requires dramatically higher maximum
    memory (gigabytes) than TinyML devices can provide. This poses a challenge, creating
    the need to innovate optimisation techniques [93] that are appropriate for each
    algorithm and MCU. Reliability is an area that can be improved in EC. Variations
    in the process, physical and logical errors, and ageing can all be potential issues.
    To ensure that an edge device is suitable for any application, it is important
    to carry out a reliability assessment before deployment. During the article selection
    process, it became clear that TinyML in MCU devices still has room for improvement
    and is in its early stages. Different reviewed articles were not selected (see
    Fig. 6) as they only mentioned using TinyML algorithms without real experimentation
    on IoT devices (MCU). While most of these papers suggested that the models can
    be applied to real devices, they only provided evaluations of the simulated models.
    6. Roadmap for anomaly detection in TinyML Creating anomaly detection models individually
    for each IoT device is too expensive. IoT nodes and the data generated by them
    have certain characteristics that do not facilitate the generation of ML models.
    The characteristics are listed below. The first inconvenience is that the data
    generated by the IoT nodes are prone to errors due to various reasons, such as
    transmission errors. This may explain the reason why anomaly detection is one
    of the main research areas of IoT data. Additionally, most IoT devices are built
    with low-cost components and are located in hostile locations, so potential errors
    can occur during data capture. In addition to the problems outlined above, there
    are also those of degradation or poor calibration [94], which increase the uncertainty
    of the data produced. This instability can adversely affect the process of generating
    ML models and their subsequent inference. The second disadvantage is that IoT
    devices depend on the environment. Temporary or permanent changes in the environment
    can occur at any time and rapid adaptation is required. Due to the nature of ML
    models, their internal logic is always data-dependent. This feature is called
    “CACE: Change Anything Changes Everything” [95] and makes it challenging to maintain
    robust ML models, due to the tight dependencies of the components. The third problem
    concerns the dynamic nature of IoT devices. Many IoT devices have the characteristic
    of being mobile, so their environment will be different depending on the location.
    In these cases, data instability is even more critical as they can constantly
    vary. Another challenge, which we previously enumerated, is the wide variety of
    IoT devices. This means that the hardware properties of each device can cause
    divergences in the data generated. For example, an IoT node equipped with temperature
    sensors or an accelerometer may have different levels of quality (e.g. accuracy)
    compared to others, depending on the specifications of the sensors. The lack of
    initial data represents one of the most controversial points in the implementation
    of new IoT devices (with ML analysis), since, initially, there are no training
    data, or there is only a limited amount of them, so the generation of ML models
    will not be possible or adequate. There are also other challenges, not related
    to the data but affecting the applicability of the data. Another problem associated
    with this type of algorithm is the lack of data science experience. IoT project
    teams are usually made up of engineers from areas closer to electronics and hardware
    (but also software). These teams typically lack data science specialists. This
    gap makes it difficult to generate ML models that are adapted and optimised for
    the conditions of IoT devices. Finally, the lack of traceability and transparency
    in the generation of the ML model, since after its generation it is impossible
    to know the characteristics of how it has been generated (data, environment or
    IoT device, among others). This makes it difficult to reuse it on other similar
    devices. In the studies analysed, it was found that ML algorithms, whether supervised
    or unsupervised, can effectively detect, identify, and categorise anomalies. The
    main advantage of both methods is their ability to learn from the vast and readily
    available data in the IoT environment, despite the fact that IoT data rarely includes
    labels indicating normal or anomalous. Due to the scarcity of labelled data, building
    a dependable anomaly detection model solely based on supervised learning algorithms
    is challenging. Moreover, the model must be capable of predicting anomalies for
    new and future data as the IoT data volume is continuously growing at a rapid
    pace, and this is a limitation of unsupervised learning algorithms. Fig. 16 shows
    the taxonomy of ML/DL algorithms created based on the SLM performed. In it, algorithms
    have been classified according to their typology, classification or clustering.
    Each algorithm has been listed individually. In addition, depending on the group
    to which they belong (supervised, unsupervised or semi-supervised), they have
    been related. In this way, based on the type of problem to be solved, it can be
    helpful to determine which algorithms have been previously applied. Validation
    and evaluation of models rely heavily on labelled data. However, datasets generated
    from IoT devices, such as the UCF dataset [76], lack normal and anomalous classes,
    which makes it difficult to establish a basic truth. This is also the case when
    working with your own dataset, as you will not have any labels to begin with.
    Although some datasets, like the CWRU dataset [72], are tagged for anomaly detection,
    there is still a need for labelled IoT datasets for network or perceptual information
    with anomaly detection, which should be addressed in future research. Download

    Distribution of articles by ML/DL algorithms. Libraries specialising in TinyML
    for MCUs have been crucial in efficiently deploying ML models on edge devices
    with limited resources. One of the leading lightweight iterations of Google’s
    TensorFlow framework tailored explicitly for MCU environments is TensorFlow Lite
    for Microcontrollers (TFLite Micro), which has been widely used in various studies
    due to its versatility [96]. uTensor is another notable contribution to the TinyML
    ecosystem. It is an open-source library designed specifically for microcontrollers
    and provides a lightweight yet powerful platform for deploying ML models [97].
    ARM’s CMSIS-NN (Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard-Neural Network)
    offers a collection of efficient NN kernels optimised for ARM Cortex-M processors,
    enhancing the performance of ML workloads [98]. Additionally, TinyOL, an emerging
    library [99], has shown promise in recent studies, contributing to the diverse
    set of tools available for TinyML applications. Notably, selected studies have
    utilised TensorFlow Lite and TinyOL, underscoring their relevance and impact in
    the realm of TinyML for MCUs. It is crucial to continue enhancing these types
    of libraries by increasing their interoperability with a wide range of hardware.
    A powerful library could serve as a solution to the absence of a hardware standard.
    In addition, it is important to perform IoT benchmarking when developing models.
    Benchmarking refers to evaluating and comparing solutions based on criteria such
    as performance or computational time using publicly available datasets. Some comparative
    studies on IoT, like the one in [100], do not make their data or algorithms available
    to the public. 7. Conclusions Meeting the current demand requires the ability
    to make intelligent strategic decisions at the edge level. As upcoming application
    domains emerge, it becomes increasingly necessary to incorporate ML algorithms
    into compact embedded devices with limited resources. The frequency of publication
    in detecting anomalies using TinyML algorithms and MCUs shows that the field is
    still in its early stages. This paper performs an SLM that follows the PRISMA
    protocol to analyse the use of TinyML to detect anomalies. Throughout this document,
    the current use of TinyML algorithms for anomaly detection, application domains
    and difficulties in building TinyML applications are shown. It is currently believed
    that there is no one algorithm that is universally superior for this issue, rather,
    there are several methods that are tailored to specific applications. Due to the
    wide range and diversity of MCU devices, the widespread use of TinyML models is
    limited. The Raspberry microcontroller family is the hardware most commonly used
    to implement these algorithms. The fact that there is a wide variety of hardware
    devices, as we have seen, also implies a wide variety of libraries/frameworks
    (seven options in total) to enable the migration of ML/DL models to MCUs. The
    anomaly detection algorithms used in MCUs do not differ from those used in other
    stages, such as in the cloud. The most commonly used category of algorithms is
    classification, CNN being the most commonly used technique. For the type of clustering
    algorithms, the most widely used is GMM. Although a large number of related articles
    have recently appeared, no studies have been found that are compatible with the
    energy saving systems of IoT devices. None of the studies analysed uses more recent
    connectivity, such as LoraWAN or 5G, or alternative energy systems, such as solar
    power. So far, the most predominant use case or domain has been industry and business,
    healthcare, smart cities and environmental monitoring. There are numerous challenges
    mentioned above, which can be explored and developed further. To overcome these
    difficulties, it is necessary to adopt interdisciplinary approaches that cover
    all the layers, including programming techniques, microarchitecture, and hardware.
    The following sectors have the potential for growth and require attention to address
    the challenges. Only three papers [71], [85], [86] of the 18 articles analysed
    make use of a multilevel architecture; that is, in most of them the results of
    the TinyML models are completed on the IoT device itself. For computational contexts
    enabled for the edge, compute task activation/offloading can be used. We can enhance
    the current flexible settings of edge-aware details by incorporating such loading
    strategies. By leveraging TinyML, we can move resource-intensive tasks from edge
    devices with limited resources, which can enable better connectivity between the
    cloud and the edge. Another aspect of improving the current state-of-the-art that
    denotes the degree of consolidation of this type of analysis is that only seven
    papers apply this model in a real-time environment. That is, the TinyML models
    generated are put into production for inference using their own data. CRediT authorship

    \ introduced as a recently developed technology in the\ntelecommunications ﬁeld.\
    \ It is a network made up of real-world objects, things, and gadgets that\nare\
    \ enabled by sensors and software that can communicate data with one another.\
    \ Systems for\nmonitoring gather, exchange, and process video and image data captured\
    \ by sensors and cameras\nacross a network. Furthermore, the novel concept of\
    \ Digital Twin offers new opportunities so that new\nproposed systems can work\
    \ virtually, but without differing in operation from a “real” system. This\npaper\
    \ is a meticulous survey of the IoT and monitoring systems to illustrate how their\
    \ combination\nwill improve certain types of the Monitoring systems of Healthcare–IoT\
    \ in the Cloud. To achieve this\ngoal, we discuss the characteristics of the IoT\
    \ that improve the use of the types of monitoring systems\nover a Multimedia Transmission\
    \ System in the Cloud. The paper also discusses some technical\nchallenges of\
    \ Multimedia in IoT, based on Healthcare data. Finally, it shows how the Mobile\
    \ Cloud\nComputing (MCC) technology, settled as base technology, enhances the\
    \ functionality of the IoT and\nhas an impact on various types of monitoring technology,\
    \ and also it proposes an algorithm approach\nto transmitting and processing video/image\
    \ data through a Cloud-based Monitoring system. To\ngather pertinent data about\
    \ the validity of our proposal in a more safe and useful way, we have\nimplemented\
    \ our proposal in a Digital Twin scenario of a Smart Healthcare system. The operation\n\
    of the suggested scenario as a Digital Twin scenario offers a more sustainable\
    \ and energy-efﬁcient\nsystem and experimental ﬁndings ultimately demonstrate\
    \ that the proposed system is more reliable\nand secure. Experimental results\
    \ show the impact of our proposed model depicts the efﬁciency of\nthe usage of\
    \ a Cloud Management System operated over a Digital Twin scenario, using real-time\n\
    large-scale data produced from the connected IoT system. Through these scenarios,\
    \ we can observe\nthat our proposal remains the best choice regardless of the\
    \ time difference or energy load.\nKeywords: Internet of Things; smart; healthcare;\

    \ careful observation of behavior and activities”.\nMost of the time, people employ\
    \ monitoring to manage, direct, inﬂuence, or defend\nthemselves. Because they\
    \ carry out the monitoring, sensors, cameras, and other appropriate\ndevices are\
    \ essential to the monitoring process. With the aid of technology, it is possible\n\
    to observe someone from a distance using electronic devices or to steal electronically\n\
    transmitted information using straightforward, useful technology techniques [1–4].\n\
    The implementation of monitoring over wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is another\n\
    application of video monitoring. This has been widely incorporated into numerous\
    \ cyber-\nphysical systems, including trafﬁc analysis, public safety, environment,\
    \ and healthcare\nmonitoring. The unwired node connection facility in WSNs is\
    \ what causes the majority of\ncommon data transfer issues. Therefore, it is still\
    \ challenging for monitoring applications\nto process and transmit large amounts\
    \ of video data at each wireless node [2,3,5–8].\nAppl. Sci. 2023, 13, 9165. https://doi.org/10.3390/app13169165\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/applsci\nAppl. Sci. 2023, 13, 9165\n2 of 28\nNetworks\
    \ for communications may be utilized by monitoring technology. Considering\nthat\
    \ they transmit videos or data generated by monitoring equipment, a device must\
    \ be\nconnected to the network for the information to be transferred. Using a\
    \ method known as\nmulti-alteration, the geographic location of a mobile device\
    \ can be more easily determined,\neven when the phone is in standby mode. In other\
    \ words, tracing an inactive device can be\nperformed by comparing the lengths\
    \ of time required for a signal to go from one mobile\nphone to any nearby cell\
    \ tower [1–3,5,9].\nA recent development in communications technology is called\
    \ the Internet of Things\n(IoT). The IoT is “the system of physical objects and\
    \ devices with sensors and network\nconnectivity that enables these objects to\
    \ collect and share data” [1–3,5,6,10].\nThe next big development is IoT technology,\
    \ which will fundamentally alter how\nbusinesses operate. In the approaching years,\
    \ it is anticipated that there will be a sizable\nand quickly expanding number\
    \ of connected devices, installed sites, and operations that\nwould carry out\
    \ [3,5]. Also, the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is a new era of this\ntechnology\
    \ representing Healthcare–IoT systems and data [6,10–12].\nAdditionally, in places\
    \ such as ofﬁces, and homes, an array of sensors may monitor\nutility networks,\
    \ and provide early prior notice of falling electricity, water leakage, and\n\
    overload of the electricity network. The information gathered will be used to\
    \ improve\nperformance, pinpoint particular needs, and establish particular requirements.\n\
    The optimization of monitoring technology through the use of the Internet of Things’\n\
    technology requires the combination of these two technologies to fully beneﬁt\
    \ from them.\nAdditionally, another technique, known as Mobile Cloud Computing\
    \ (MCC), emerged\nand was enhanced by recent advances in the “cloud computing”\
    \ (CC) industry. By elim-\ninating the requirement for physical equipment, the\
    \ latter attempts to provide access to\ndata and information at any time and from\
    \ any location [6,10,11,13]. MCC is deﬁned as the\nintegration of cloud and mobile\
    \ computing, which makes mobile devices more capable.\nAdditionally, it represents\
    \ a modern strategy for businesses and organizations seeking\ncreative services.\
    \ Both the Internet of Things and video monitoring systems can beneﬁt\nfrom using\
    \ CC as a base, which will improve how they work [14–16].\nAt last, to verify\
    \ the operation of our proposal and to evaluate our proposed algorithm,\nwe used\
    \ a Digital Twin scenario. Our simulation method is based on novel software such\
    \ as\nCloudSim 3.0.3 and Cooja Contiki. The purpose of the Digital Twin scenario\
    \ is to simulate\nthe operation of a Smart Hospital, hosting a Cloud Server, through\
    \ which IoT Healthcare\ndata is transferred, managed, and processed. Digital Twin\
    \ offers more reliable results for\nour proposal. By creating a virtual model\
    \ that faithfully replicates a physical product, we\nemploy the Digital Twin concept\
    \ in our proposal to better forecast how well it will perform.\nAfter that, we\
    \ were able to extract useful information about the reliability of our proposal,\n\
    as well as the degree of improvement of the existing situation [17]. Thus, regarding\
    \ a Smart\nHealthcare system [18], the concept of a Digital Twin scenario would\
    \ be suitable due to\nsensitive medical data needing to be used.\nMoreover, the\
    \ major goal of this work is initially to survey emerging technologies and\nsystems\
    \ of the telecommunications ﬁeld, such as IoT, Monitoring, Big Data, and Cloud\n\
    Computing, and then to ﬁnd the open gaps in their integration model. This offered\
    \ us\nthe opportunity to discover novel ways to combine the aforementioned technologies\
    \ in\nthe era of achieving a better system. In addition to this, we have tried\
    \ to achieve a better\nway of transmitting and processing video/image data through\
    \ a Cloud-based Monitoring\nsystem by proposing a novel algorithm. Furthermore,\
    \ to produce an algorithm for better\ntransmission and management of IoT Big Data\
    \ over a Cloud environment through a Digital\nTwin scenario, simulating virtual\
    \ Cloud-Servers and a Smart Hospital installation in which\ndata produced from\
    \ a monitoring system is transferred, managed, and processed, we have\ntried to\
    \ produce an algorithm combining all the different models of encryption algorithms.\n\
    Finally, we can present the key contributions of our work as a result of the presentation\n\
    of the fundamental theoretical data of the research topic of this work. This work’s\
    \ key\ncontributions are:\nAppl. Sci. 2023, 13, 9165\n3 of 28\n•\nCombine the\

    \ & Current Research\nFor this paper, we studied and analyzed the existing literature\
    \ on the ﬁelds of moni-\ntoring and the IoT. We realized that the usage of monitoring\
    \ in general and its combination,\nspeciﬁcally with the IoT, became more vital\
    \ over the years. Thus, the rising number of\nstudies suggests that more study\
    \ is needed in this ﬁeld. Figure 1 illustrates the explosive\ngrowth of papers\
    \ addressing monitoring and concerns regarding the IoT. As we can see,\ncompared\
    \ to the prior decade, scholars’ interest has signiﬁcantly expanded over the past\n\
    seven years. As we can observe in the ﬁrst step of the diagram, the interest of\
    \ the papers\nengaged in this ﬁeld was very low, and on the other hand, after\
    \ ten years of research and\nthe advancement of technology, we realized that both\
    \ investigations and interest increased\nsigniﬁcantly. However, the rapid development\
    \ of the IoT, as it is perceived by its use in\nindustry, has contributed to this.\n\
    The following paragraphs present the papers that we ﬁltered out and contributed\n\
    signiﬁcantly to our study.\nTo begin with, we initially present the major research\
    \ that were conducted during\nthe period 2000–2010. R. T. Collins et al. [19]\
    \ presented research challenges for both\ntechnologies and applications of the\
    \ IoT. In addition to this, this work presents a summary\nof the major problems\
    \ affecting the development of technology and services of the IoT. C.\nClavel\
    \ et al. [20] presented how multimedia surveillance applications could detect\
    \ audio\nevents in noisy environments. This work concentrates especially on the\
    \ robustness of the\ndetection against the variable, malign conditions, and the\
    \ decrease of the false rejection rate.\nAll these are minutely signiﬁcant in\
    \ surveillance applications. Also, a consumer camera\nthat conceives a whippy\
    \ framework for semantic analysis of the behavior of humans from\na monocular\
    \ Video Surveillance (VS) is studied and proposed by W. Lao et al. [21]. The\n\
    proposed framework, which consists of four processing levels, was evaluated, and\
    \ showed\nits good quality and efﬁcacy as it achieved a close real-time prosecution.\
    \ In addition, R.\nH. Weber [22] addressed measures supporting the usage of methods\
    \ regarding the IoT, as\nwell as laws governing IT security. Also, in this work,\
    \ there is a discussion of the need to\nestablish a task force focusing on the\
    \ legal issues of IoT.\nAppl. Sci. 2023, 13, 9165\n4 of 28\nAppl. Sci. 2023, 13,\

    \ which is a video-based traﬃc surveillance multi-\nagent system described by\

    \ In addition, an elaborate framework for storing privacy data in VS as\na watermark\
    \ was proposed by W. Zhang et al. [26]. The simulation results of this work\n\
    showed that the proposed algorithm can incorporate all protected data on a video\

    \ targets via real-time video streaming, classifying\nthem into speciﬁed groups\
    \ based on image-based characteristics, and then successfully\ntracking them.\
    \ The resulting system deﬁnes the objects of interest, rejects the state of the\n\
    background, and constantly observes the long distances and periods, despite obstructions.\n\
    It also notes any changes in appearance and dismissal of the moving target. Moreover,\
    \ a\nmethod for Internet-of-Things-aware Process Modelling, which utilizes UML\
    \ use cases and\nan existing BPMN-based notation that is IoT-aware, was presented\
    \ by R. Petrasch and R.\nHentschke [28]. Moreover, alternative approaches to consolidating\
    \ WSNs into the Internet,\nand a summary of possible challenges that should be\
    \ addressed soon, were evaluated by Md.\nS. Mahmud et al. [29]. This work unveiled\
    \ that the denouements currently developed on the\nInternet are not appropriate\
    \ for the resources of the narrow sensor node, and therefore, new\nAppl. Sci.\
    \ 2023, 13, 9165\n5 of 28\nmechanisms should be produced to conform to the potentialities\
    \ and restrictions of WSNs.\nIntegrated research on connectivity and energy-saving\
    \ aspects and solutions of the IoT in\nthe use of various wireless radio access\
    \ technologies was presented by A. Javed et al. [30].\nIt also discusses the possible\
    \ issues of the future use of IoT. Furthermore, a human vital sign\nmonitoring\
    \ system that comprises the measurement of body temperature and pulse rate\nof\
    \ patients from remote locations was presented by P. Hu et al. [31]. This system\
    \ occupies\ncertain features, such as minor intrusiveness to the users, and helps\
    \ both caretakers and\nphysicians by providing them with leisure in taking care\
    \ of patients.\nIn more recent work in the ﬁeld, between 2018 and 2020, initially,\
    \ for advanced scalable\nMedia-based smart Big Data on Intelligent Cloud Computing\
    \ systems, K. Psannis et al. [32]\nsuggested an effective algorithm (3D, Ultra\
    \ HD). Performance evaluations show that their\nsuggested approach outperforms\
    \ the traditional HEVC standard. According to the authors,\nthis suggested solution\
    \ might be utilized and integrated into HEVC as Smart Big Data\nwithout breaking\
    \ the standard. Moreover, P. Chandrakar et al. [33] developed a cloud-based\n\
    authentication protocol for e-health care monitoring systems, which provides a\
    \ secure plat-\nform for patients. With this proposed system, the patients–users\
    \ can obtain the best medical\nfacilities and treatment from doctors through their\
    \ mobile phones without physically vis-\niting the hospitals. Additionally, the\
    \ authors study the security aspects of their proposal\nby using a popular automated\
    \ pro-verify tool. Furthermore, M. S. Hossain et al. [34] put\nforth a B5G architecture\
    \ that makes use of the low-latency, high-bandwidth capabilities of\nthe 5G network\
    \ to identify COVID-19 using chest X-ray or CT scan images and created\na mass\
    \ surveillance system to track social distance, mask use, and body temperature.\
    \ In\naddition, to study the security aspect of their proposal, they used blockchain\
    \ technology to\nensure the security of healthcare data. In another work, for\
    \ applications involving health\nmonitoring, I. S. Binti Md Isa et al. [35] proposed\
    \ a brand-new fog computing architecture\nbuilt on a gigabit passive optical network\
    \ (GPON) access network. For their proposal,\nthey developed an Energy-Efﬁcient\
    \ Fog Computing (EEFC) model by using Mixed Integer\nLinear Programming (MILP)\
    \ to optimize the number and location of fog devices at the\nnetwork edge to process\
    \ and analyze health data for energy-efﬁcient fog computing. N.\nMani et al.’s\
    \ [36] research focused on healthcare using the IoT in real-time notiﬁcation\n\
    with the use of fog computing, which handles all the computing and aids clinicians\
    \ in\nfully comprehending the patient’s disease. The tools assist those who have\
    \ trouble under-\nstanding their condition and what they should do. A new computer\
    \ paradigm, called fog\ncomputing, has developed since it ﬁrst came into usage.\
    \ It aims to close the gap between\ncomputations and data sources from medical\
    \ facilities. Furthermore, the novel computing\nplatform established on the fog\
    \ computing paradigm can aid in reducing latency while\nsending and communicating\
    \ signals with faraway servers, which might speed up medical\nservices in the\
    \ spatial and temporal dimensions.\nFinally, the last and more recent works we\
    \ have studied are between 2021 and 2023.\nUsing the Digital Twin paradigm, H.\
    \ Elayan et al. [37] suggested and put into practice\nan intelligent, context-aware\
    \ healthcare system. This framework is a useful addition to\ndigital healthcare\
    \ and will enhance operational efﬁciency in the healthcare industry. In\norder\
    \ to diagnose heart disease and identify cardiac issues, a classiﬁer model for\
    \ ECG heart\nrhythms was created using machine learning. The built models accurately\
    \ and reliably\npredicted a speciﬁc heart condition using several strategies.\
    \ The application of machine\nlearning and artiﬁcial intelligence with various\
    \ human body parameters for continuous\nmonitoring and abnormality detection was\
    \ also inspired by the implementation of an\nECG classiﬁer that recognizes cardiac\
    \ problems. Furthermore, Digital twin research and\napplication are the main topics\
    \ covered by D. Yang et al. [38]. Additionally, they examined\ncurrent digital\
    \ twin breakthroughs before summarizing the theory behind the technology\nand\
    \ concluding with concrete advancements in several digital twin application ﬁelds.\n\
    Moreover, R. Rajavel et al. [39] introduced the Cloud-based Object Tracking and\
    \ Behavior\nIdentiﬁcation System (COTBIS), which can incorporate the edge computing\
    \ capability\nframework at the gateway level. This research is an emerging research\
    \ area of the IoT\nAppl. Sci. 2023, 13, 9165\n6 of 28\nthat can bring robustness\
    \ and intelligence to distributed video surveillance systems by\nminimizing network\
    \ bandwidth and response time between wireless cameras and cloud\nservers. Also,\
    \ the proposal of an IoT-based smart healthcare video surveillance system\nuses\
    \ edge computing to reduce the network bandwidth and response time and maximize\n\
    the fall behavior prediction accuracy signiﬁcantly compared to existing cloud-based\
    \ video\nsurveillance systems. On this basis, X. Li et al.’s [40] research aims\
    \ to do Big Data Analysis\non the huge amounts of data generated by the Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT) in smart cities,\ncausing the smart city to shift in the direction\
    \ of good governance and effective and secure\ndata processing. This study introduces\
    \ the Deep Learning method utilizing Big Data\nAnalysis and advances the distributed\
    \ parallelism technique of Convolutional Neural\nNetwork with a focus on the multi-source\
    \ data gathered in the smart city. X. Li et al.’s\nresearch led them to the conclusion\
    \ that enhancing the IoT-Big Data Analysis system of\nsmart cities can reduce\
    \ data transmission delay, improve data forecasting accuracy, and\noffer actual\
    \ efﬁcacy, providing experimental references for the future digital development\n\
    of smart cities. Furthermore, through their research, S. P. Ramu et al. [41] have\
    \ focused on\nthe integration of these two promising technologies for use in real-time\
    \ and life-critical\nscenarios, as well as for simplicity in governance in applications\
    \ based on smart cities.\nThe authors also present a thorough overview of the\
    \ numerous Federated Learning model\napplications in Digital Twin s based on smart\
    \ cities. This study’s key ﬁnding is that there\nare some signiﬁcant obstacles\
    \ to overcome and promising approaches moving forward for\nbetter Federated Learning-Digital\
    \ Twin integration in applications. At last, Z. Lv et al. [42]\nanticipate exploring\
    \ the Digital Twins of a Smart City’s Building Information Modeling\n(BIM) Big\
    \ Data (BD) processing approach in order to hasten the development of a Smart\n\
    City and enhance the precision of data processing. Building Information Modeling,\
    \ which\noptimizes diverse resources and building conﬁgurations, creates the keel\
    \ and structure of\nthe building. To process the multi-dimensional and complicated\
    \ Big Data based on the\ncompositive rough set concept, they also proposed the\
    \ Multi-Graphics Processing Unit\n(GPU): a complex data fusion and effective learning\
    \ technique. A brand-new architecture\nfor healthcare monitoring based on fog\
    \ computing was put forth by F. Alanazi et al. [43]\nto manage real-time notiﬁcation.\
    \ This proposed system uses machine learning algorithms\nto monitor a patient’s\
    \ body temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure values obtained\nfrom sensors\
    \ built into a wearable device. It alerts doctors or caregivers in real time if\
    \ any\ndeviations from the normal threshold value occur. Patients can also be\
    \ set up to receive\nnotiﬁcations to remind them to take their regular medications\
    \ or follow a healthy diet. The\ncloud layer keeps the large amounts of data there\
    \ for use by researchers and hospitals in\nthe future. Additionally, through their\
    \ research, N. El Imane Zeghib et al. [44] suggest a\nmulti-route plan that attempts\
    \ to ﬁnd a different path in order to guarantee the availability\nof time-sensitive\
    \ medical treatments. Different scenarios were created in order to assess\nthe\
    \ effectiveness of their suggested technique. Furthermore, when compared to the\
    \ most\nrecent relevant work, the experimental ﬁndings of this study show that\
    \ their approach is\nsuperior in terms of latency, energy consumption, and network\
    \ usage. With their chapter,\nM. Thakkar et al. [45] seek to obtain a better understanding\
    \ and perspective of the most\ncutting-edge IoT-based applications, such as Cloud\
    \ Computing and Fog Computing, and\ntheir implementations in the healthcare industry.\
    \ A few research articles from after 2015\nwere included in this chapter based\
    \ on the inclusion and exclusion criteria established for\nthe study. The conclusions\
    \ from these articles indicate that IoT-based fog computing and\ncloud computing\
    \ expand patient access to high-quality healthcare services. Additionally,\nthe\
    \ authors draw the conclusion from their work that edge computing could be used\
    \ to\ndramatically increase the availability of health services at home.\nTable\
    \ 1 demonstrates, in ascending, chronological order, the most important and\n\
    representative ﬁndings of the background research that represent the mapping problems\n\
    against solutions. Counting on the ﬁndings delivered from Table 1, we can conclude\n\
    that this ﬁeld gathers too much attention from researchers who tried to overcome\
    \ many\nissues that arise. Moreover, the research ﬁndings and the solutions to\
    \ problems that arose\nAppl. Sci. 2023, 13, 9165\n7 of 28\nshaped how we were\
    \ able to achieve our goal, in the design and implementation of the\nproposed\

    \ & Internet of Things\n3.1. Video Monitoring\nThe term Monitoring includes various\
    \ types of observation devices. These are: (1) Com-\nputer, (2) Telephones, (3)\
    \ Cameras, (4) Social network analysis, (5) Biometric, (6) Aerial,\n(7) Data mining,\
    \ (8) Corporate, (9) Human operatives, (10) Satellite imagery, (11) Identiﬁca-\n\
    tion and credentials, (12) RFID devices, (13) Human Microchips, (14) Devices,\
    \ (15) Portal\nservices, (16) Stakeout. In this paper, we single out and deal\
    \ with speciﬁc types of Video\nMonitoring, which are listed below [1–3,5,6,46–49].\n\
    3.1.1. Computer\nComputer supervision is the observation of computer activity\
    \ and the data stored\non the hard disk of this computer. If someone can establish\
    \ software on a computer\nsystem, they could easily acquire unauthorized admission\
    \ to that computer system, and\nconsequently, its data. This software could be\
    \ installed remotely or directly [50].\nAppl. Sci. 2023, 13, 9165\n11 of 28\n\
    3.1.2. Telephones\nPhone surveillance is deﬁned as “the act of executing phone\
    \ surveillance, location\ntracking, and phone data monitoring” [51].\n3.1.3. Cameras\n\
    Cameras are frequently associated with a recording device or an IP network, which\n\
    could be monitored by a security guard [52].\n3.1.4. Biometric\nThe Biometrics\
    \ type of monitoring refers to measurements related to human features.\nAlso,\
    \ it is used to identify individuals in groups that are under monitoring [53,54].\n\
    3.1.5. Data Mining\nData mining could be deﬁned as “an interdisciplinary subﬁeld\
    \ of computer science” [55].\nData mining is the implementation of statistical\
    \ techniques and programming algorithms\nthat dig out the previous unobserved\
    \ afﬁnities between data [15,54]. Data proﬁling may be\na very strong tool for\
    \ psychological and social network analysis [56].\n3.1.6. RFID Devices\nElectro-magnetic\
    \ ﬁelds are used by radio-frequency identiﬁcation (RFID) to automati-\ncally identify\
    \ and track tags afﬁxed to items. These tags include data that are electronically\n\
    stored. The passive tags acquire energy from an RFID reader placed close to the\
    \ radio\nsignals being questioned. The active tags have a local energy source\
    \ (e.g., a battery) [57].\n3.2. Internet of Things\nThe Internet of Things (IoT)\
    \ is a network of various gadgets that share and transmit\ninformation from the\
    \ real world to offer services to people, businesses, and society [12,58].\nAdvantages\
    \ of the Data\nOne major question relevant to the IoT is how it could inﬂuence\
    \ our daily life. Continu-\nous feeds are sent and received by every sort of sensor\
    \ to track and automate operations [59].\nIntending to bring about bold change\
    \ or enhance current services, there are various possi-\nbilities where the streaming\
    \ data could open up new markets. Several examples of ﬁelds\nthat constitute the\
    \ heart of this progress are listed below [60]: IoT-(a) Smart solutions in\nthe\
    \ bucket of transport, IoT-(b) Smart power grids incorporating more renewable,\
    \ IoT-(c)\nRemote monitoring of patients, IoT-(d) Sensors in homes and airports,\
    \ IoT-(e) Engine\nmonitoring sensors that detect and predict maintenance issues.\n\
    3.3. Video Monitoring in Healthcare Sector\nIn a variety of contexts, including\
    \ patient monitoring, eldercare, clinical settings,\nand telemedicine, video monitoring\
    \ in healthcare was investigated and researched. Tech-\nnologies for video surveillance\
    \ have the potential to enhance patient care, increase safety,\nand simplify medical\
    \ procedures. The following are some important conclusions and\nrevelations from\
    \ academic studies on video monitoring in healthcare: (1) Remote Patient\nMonitoring\
    \ and Telemedicine: Without the need for in-person visits, video monitoring enables\n\
    healthcare professionals to remotely monitor patients’ symptoms, have virtual\
    \ consulta-\ntions, and provide medical recommendations. According to research,\
    \ telemedicine and\nvideo monitoring can enhance the management of chronic illnesses,\
    \ decrease hospital\nreadmission rates, and increase patient satisfaction. (2)\
    \ Fall Detection and Elderly Care: In par-\nticular, in eldercare settings, video\
    \ surveillance systems can be utilized to identify falls and\noffer quick assistance.\
    \ According to studies, adopting video-based fall detection technology\ncan speed\
    \ up reaction times, lessen injuries, and improve senior patients’ overall safety\
    \ and\nwellbeing. (3) Clinical Environment Monitoring: In healthcare settings,\
    \ video surveillance\ncan be used to increase staff training, patient safety,\
    \ and workﬂow effectiveness. Video\nAppl. Sci. 2023, 13, 9165\n12 of 28\nanalytics,\
    \ for instance, can be used to monitor patient compliance with hand cleanliness,\n\
    identify anomalous patient behaviors, and improve patient ﬂow in hospitals. (4)\
    \ Privacy and\nEthical Considerations: Maintaining patient privacy and upholding\
    \ ethical standards provide\na substantial problem in video monitoring healthcare\
    \ situations. Research has shown how\ncrucial it is to put in place strong security\
    \ measures, obtain patients’ informed consent,\nand make sure that all pertinent\
    \ data protection laws are followed. (5) Behavioral Analysis\nand Machine Learning:\
    \ Machine learning algorithms can be applied to video surveillance\nsystems to\
    \ assess patient behavior, spot patterns, and spot anomalies. For the purpose\
    \ of\nmonitoring individuals with cognitive impairments or mental health issues,\
    \ this technology\ncan be especially helpful. (6) Real-Time Monitoring for Critical\
    \ Care: When combined with\nother medical devices, video monitoring can provide\
    \ real-time insights into a patient’s\nstate, providing medical personnel with\
    \ useful information for prompt decision-making\nin life-or-death circumstances.\
    \ (7) Fall Risk Assessment and Prevention: Video monitoring\ncombined with machine\
    \ learning algorithms can aid in fall risk assessment and prevention.\nBy analyzing\
    \ gait patterns and identifying risk factors, healthcare providers can develop\n\
    personalized fall prevention strategies for patients. (8) Surgical Training and\
    \ Simulation: The\nuse of video monitoring as a training and simulation tool for\
    \ surgery was investigated.\nSurgery can be recorded and examined to assist aspiring\
    \ surgeons to hone their abilities\nand absorb knowledge from more seasoned mentors.\
    \ (9) Diagnostics and Telepathology:\nTelepathology can use video surveillance\
    \ to assess tissue samples from a distance and help\nwith diagnoses. This strategy\
    \ can enhance access to professional perspectives in areas with\nconstrained healthcare\
    \ resources.\nIt is signiﬁcant to emphasize that the use of video surveillance\
    \ in healthcare also brings\nup issues related to patient privacy, data security,\
    \ and the potential for improper usage of\nvideo. When implementing video monitoring\
    \ solutions in healthcare settings, it is crucial\nto put in place the necessary\
    \ precautions and make sure that they adhere to ethical norms\nand healthcare\
    \ legislation.\n3.4. Internet of Things Big Data in Healthcare Sector\nIoT-based\
    \ Big Data have received a great deal of attention in the healthcare industry\n\
    and hold great promise for enhancing patient care, illness management, and operational\n\
    efﬁciency. The following are some signiﬁcant themes and conclusions from various\
    \ scientiﬁc\nstudies on IoT-based Big Data in healthcare: (1) Remote Patient Monitoring\
    \ and Wearable\nDevices: Smartwatches and ﬁtness trackers are two examples of\
    \ wearables with capabilities\nof the IoT that are being employed for remote patient\
    \ monitoring. Vital signs, activity levels,\nand other health-related data can\
    \ be continuously collected by these devices and sent to\nhealthcare professionals\
    \ in real-time. According to research, remote patient monitoring with\nIoT Big\
    \ Data can help with early disease identiﬁcation, better chronic disease management,\n\
    and patient engagement. (2) Real-Time Healthcare Analytics: Real-time monitoring\
    \ and\ndecision-making are made possible by IoT-generated data in the healthcare\
    \ sector and\nBig Data analytics. For instance, IoT sensors built into hospital\
    \ equipment can deliver\nreal-time information on environmental conditions, patient\
    \ vital signs, and equipment\nstatus. Real-time data analysis can result in shorter\
    \ response times, device predictive\nmaintenance, and better patient outcomes.\
    \ (3) Healthcare Asset and Inventory Management:\nIn order to improve asset and\
    \ inventory management in healthcare institutions, IoT and\nBig Data are used.\
    \ Using IoT sensors to track medical supplies, drug inventories, and other\nnecessities\
    \ can improve operational efﬁciency overall, optimize resource use, and reduce\n\
    waste. (4) Healthcare Supply Chain Optimization: The healthcare supply chain is\
    \ also being\noptimized using IoT and Big Data technology. Healthcare providers\
    \ can more effectively\nmanage inventories, cut costs, and guarantee timely delivery\
    \ of essential commodities by\ncollecting and analyzing data on the movement of\
    \ medical supplies and drugs. (5) IoT-\nEnabled Smart Hospitals: Big Data analytics\
    \ combined with IoT technologies can build smart\nhospitals with interconnected\
    \ systems. The seamless data interchange between medical\nequipment, electronic\
    \ medical records, and patient information systems is made possible\nAppl. Sci.\
    \ 2023, 13, 9165\n13 of 28\nby this interconnectedness. Improved patient care,\
    \ increased patient safety, and resource\nallocation are all goals of smart hospitals.\
    \ (6) Health Behavior Monitoring and Predictive\nModeling: IoT devices have the\
    \ ability to gather information about patients’ everyday\nroutines, habits, and\
    \ lifestyle decisions. This information can be utilized to build predictive\n\
    models for health outcomes and interventions when paired with Big Data analytics.\
    \ For\ninstance, information from smartwatches can be used to track changes in\
    \ physical activity\nlevels or forecast sleep disorders. (7) Healthcare Data Privacy\
    \ and Security: It is crucial to\nprotect data privacy and security when IoT devices\
    \ collect and send critical patient data.\nIn order to safeguard patient information\
    \ from unwanted access or cyberattacks, recent\nresearch has concentrated on creating\
    \ secure IoT architectures, encryption methods, and\naccess control systems. (8)\
    \ Chronic Disease Management: By offering real-time insights\non patients’ health\
    \ problems, IoT Big Data has the potential to completely transform\nthe management\
    \ of chronic diseases. Chronic diseases like diabetes and hypertension\ncan beneﬁt\
    \ from ongoing monitoring, since it allows for more individualized treatment\n\
    approaches and improved disease management. (9) IoT-Based Telemedicine and Virtual\
    \ Care:\nThe development of telemedicine and virtual care services is greatly\
    \ aided by IoT devices\nand Big Data analytics. Patients can obtain medical guidance\
    \ and treatment from the\ncomfort of their homes thanks to remote consultations\
    \ and virtual health platforms.\nThe use of IoT-based Big Data in healthcare is\
    \ a topic that is constantly changing,\nand new study ﬁndings are frequently released.\
    \ I suggest running searches on respected\nacademic databases and journals linked\
    \ to healthcare informatics and IoT technology to\nobtain the most recent research\
    \ articles and developments in this ﬁeld.\n4. IoT Contribution to Monitoring Systems\n\
    According to our research in the Background and Current Research Section, we\n\
    developed the following conclusions.\nThe event identiﬁcation problem in noisy\
    \ surroundings for a multimedia monitoring\napplication is the core challenge\
    \ of the Internet of Things and monitoring technology. This\nissue is resolved\
    \ with the detection of the anomaly in sequential audio recordings of public\n\
    spaces [20,40]. The Internet of Things (IoT) is also crucial for solving issues\
    \ with eHealth\nsystems, since connected patient data will enable more effective\
    \ and thorough treatment.\nAn all-encompassing Internet of Things model in an\
    \ eHealth scenario, which focuses on\ncreating an intelligent medical environment\
    \ and offering ubiquitous services at its best,\nresolves this problem [25]. Finally,\
    \ a condensed domain video watermarking solution based\non perceptual models resolves\
    \ the signiﬁcant payload issue in monitoring systems [26].\nTable 2 lists the\
    \ characteristics of the technology of the Internet of Things, concerning\nthe\
    \ commodity it provides. Additionally, it illustrates some of the varieties of\
    \ monitoring\nthat, from our perspective, are more closely related to the Internet\
    \ of Things. The purpose\nof Table 2 is to illustrate how certain properties of\
    \ the IoT relate to and beneﬁt particular\ntypes of monitoring. As we can see,\
    \ the forms of monitoring that are most affected by\ncharacteristics of the IoT\
    \ are cameras and RFID devices. Contrarily, the Biometric form of\nmonitoring\
    \ is the one that is least impacted by features of the IoT.\nTable 2. Internet\

    \ technologies. The challenges were examined concerning several related\npublications\
    \ that surveyed and suggested architectures that integrate monitoring and the\n\
    IoT: (1) event detection problems in noisy environments for a multimedia monitoring\n\
    application and (2) transmission of data through the video recorder devices, and\
    \ how those\ndevices should be set up for better remote usage.\nMore speciﬁcally,\

    According to Dlamini et al. [24] “The linking of precisely identiﬁable embedded\n\
    computing devices within the current Internet infrastructure” is how the Internet\
    \ of Things\nis formally described. IoT is typically expected to deliver universal\
    \ connectivity of the\nAppl. Sci. 2023, 13, 9165\n16 of 28\nsystems, services,\
    \ and devices that enable machine-to-machine (M2M) communications\nacross a variety\
    \ of protocols, applications, and domains.\nThere are a variety of ﬁelds and technical\
    \ challenges of Multimedia in the sector\nof IoT. Some of these are: (1) Experiment\
    \ measurement of multimedia communication\nin the IoT, (2) Distributed/Centralized\
    \ multimedia coding in the IoT, (3) Scalable and\nlow delay source coding in the\
    \ IoT, (4) Distributed multimedia compression in the IoT,\n(5) Communication and\

    \ to the Internet\nof Things, regarding the commodity they offer. Additionally,\
    \ they discuss a few of the\nTechnical Challenges of Multimedia in the IoT, which\
    \ in our opinion, are more relevant to\nthe Internet of Things. To begin with,\
    \ Table 4′s purpose is to illustrate which of the IoT’s\ndistinctive traits correspond\
    \ to the appropriate category, as well as to disperse the many\ntechnical obstacles\
    \ associated with multimedia communication in the IoT. Subsequently, the\nscope\
    \ of Table 5 is to show which of the characteristics of the IoT belong to and\
    \ distribute\nthe particular ﬁelds of the Technical challenges of Multimedia Applications\

    service acts without the limitation of hardware equipment [39,65,66]. The fault\
    \ tolerance\nand low-performance issues that typically prevent the use of huge\
    \ amounts of data could\nbe addressed by modifying the CC resources and methodologies\
    \ [66]. Also, one of the\nchallenges in the ﬁeld of IoT is the combination with\
    \ CC.\nThe necessity to maintain expensive computing gear and software is removed\
    \ by CC\ntechnology [67]. To address the recurring fault tolerance issues and\
    \ subpar performance\nthat cause bottlenecks while employing enormous volumes\
    \ of data, the CC techniques and\nresources could be modiﬁed [68]. Also, one of\
    \ the challenges in the ﬁeld of the IoT is the\ncombination with CC. Given this,\
    \ CC offers a good way for things to become connected\nand allow users to access\
    \ various things on the internet [69–71].\nIn particular, a deﬁnition of MCC could\
    \ be the consummation of CC with mobile de-\nvices and services to render the\
    \ mobile devices well off in various terms such as storage and\ncomputational\
    \ power. MCC is the result of multidisciplinary approaches, blending mobile\n\
    computing and CC. CC also offers services, storage, computing, and applications\
    \ over the\nInternet. So, this multidisciplinary domain is moreover referred to\
    \ as MCC [39,65,66].\nThe following are some of the primary MCC characteristics\
    \ that pertain to both the\nInternet of Things and Monitoring features: MCC-(a)\

    \ over the Cloud\nThe safety and security of the data generated by IoT-based systems,\
    \ which mostly\nrefers to Big Data, which is transferred and managed over a Cloud-based\
    \ system, is a key\nconcern for this research. Multiple aspects of data security\
    \ and privacy are involved in\nIoT-based Big Data secure transmission and administration\
    \ through a cloud system. Below\nis an overview of the main methods and safeguards\
    \ employed to guarantee the privacy\nand security of data in this situation.\n\
    Encryption: A crucial method for preserving data secrecy during transmission and\n\
    storage is encryption. For secure communication channels with cloud services,\
    \ IoT devices\ncan use encryption protocols like Transport Layer Security (TLS)\
    \ or Secure Sockets Layer\n(SSL). As a result, information sent between IoT devices\
    \ and the cloud is encrypted and\nkept out of the hands of unauthorized parties\
    \ [3,5,10,11].\nAccess Control: Access control technologies are essential for\
    \ limiting illegal access to\ncloud-based IoT data. To implement data access limitations\
    \ based on user roles, privileges,\nor particular attributes, role-based access\
    \ control (RBAC) and attribute-based access control\n(ABAC) are frequently utilized.\
    \ Mechanisms for access control help prevent unwanted data\nalteration or leaking\
    \ [3,5,10,11].\nData Integrity: For IoT data to be accurate and reliable, maintaining\
    \ data integrity is\nessential. Data integrity can be checked during transmission\
    \ and storage using methods\nsuch as message authentication codes (MACs) and digital\
    \ signatures. These methods aid in\nthe detection of unapproved data alterations\
    \ [3,5,10,11].\nSecure Protocols and Standards: It is crucial to adhere to secure\
    \ communication methods\nand standards. IoT device-speciﬁc protocols with security\
    \ features, like authentication\nand encryption, include MQTT (Message Queuing\
    \ Telemetry Transport) and CoAP (Con-\nstrained Application Protocol). Data transmission\
    \ over the cloud is secure when certain\nprocedures are followed [3,5,10,11].\n\
    Appl. Sci. 2023, 13, 9165\n19 of 28\nPrivacy Preservation: When working with sensitive\
    \ IoT data, maintaining user pri-\nvacy is essential. A useful analysis of the\
    \ aggregated data can still be performed while\nmasking or obscuring personally\
    \ identifying information (PII), using methods such as data\nanonymization, aggregation,\
    \ and differential privacy. While allowing useful insights from\nIoT big data,\
    \ privacy-enhancing solutions help protect user privacy [3,5,10,11].\nData Lifecycle\
    \ Management: The security and privacy of IoT data are supported by a\nthorough\
    \ approach to data lifecycle management. This includes regular backups to guard\n\
    against data loss and secure data deletion when it is no longer required. Data\
    \ lifecycle\nmanagement requires the implementation of data retention regulations\
    \ and secure data\ndisposal procedures [3,5,10,11].\nIntrusion Detection and Prevention:\
    \ Network trafﬁc can be monitored by intrusion\ndetection and prevention systems\
    \ (IDPS), which can then identify any unusual or mali-\ncious activity. To identify\
    \ potential security breaches or assaults on IoT devices or cloud\ninfrastructure,\
    \ advanced anomaly detection algorithms and machine learning approaches\ncan be\
    \ deployed. Real-time response to security incidents is made possible by these\n\
    tools [3,5,10,11].\nRegular Security Updates and Patches: The most recent security\
    \ patches and upgrades\nshould be applied to IoT devices, cloud systems, and related\
    \ software to maintain a\nsecure environment. This lessens the chance of exploitation\
    \ and addresses any known\nvulnerabilities [3,5,10,11].\nBased on the aforementioned\
    \ factors, effort was conducted in the ﬁrst stage to build\nan algorithm that\
    \ would harmonize the logic and operation of the most popular encryption\nalgorithms.\
    \ The technique that shows how to combine encryption algorithms for secure\ndata\
    \ management and transmission is described below.\nThe encryption and decryption\
    \ operations of the ﬁrst encryption algorithm are de-\nnoted in Algorithm 1 by\
    \ the functions encryptWithAlgorithm1() and decryptWithAlgorithm1(),\nrespectively.\
    \ The encryption and decryption functions of the second encryption algorithm\n\
    are represented, respectively, by the functions encryptWithAlgorithm2() and decryptWithAl-\n\
    gorithm2(). The actual encryption and decryption methods we want to employ each\
    \ time,\nsuch as AES, RSA, or any other encryption algorithms of our choice, can\
    \ be substituted\nfor the aforementioned function names in the suggested scenario.\
    \ The input of Algorithm\n1 obtains the transmitted data of video/image before\
    \ encryption and the output is the\ntransmitted data of video/image after encryption\
    \ and ready to be transmitted. Also, in the\nreverse procedure, Algorithm 1 obtains\
    \ the encrypted transmitted data of video/image\nand the output is the decrypted\
    \ transmitted data of video/image ready to be used.\nAlgorithm 1: Encryption/Decryption\
    \ procedure of transmitted data of video/image\n1. Initialize variables:\n- plaintext:\
    \ the original data to be transmitted\n- key1: encryption key for the ﬁrst encryption\
    \ algorithm\n- key2: encryption key for the second encryption algorithm\n- ciphertext:\
    \ the encrypted data\n2. Encrypt the data using the ﬁrst encryption algorithm:\n\
    encryptedData1 = encryptWithAlgorithm1(plaintext, key1)\n3. Encrypt the output\
    \ of the ﬁrst encryption using the second encryption algorithm:\nencryptedData2\
    \ = encryptWithAlgorithm2(encryptedData1, key2)\n4. Transmit the encrypted data\
    \ (encryptedData2) over the network.\n5. On the receiving end, receive the encrypted\
    \ data.\n6. Decrypt the encrypted data using the second encryption algorithm:\n\
    decryptedData1 = decryptWithAlgorithm2(encryptedData2, key2)\n7. Decrypt the output\
    \ of the second encryption using the ﬁrst encryption algorithm:\ndecryptedData2\
    \ = decryptWithAlgorithm1(decryptedData1, key1)\n8. The original plaintext data\
    \ is now recovered and stored in decryptedData2.\n9. Perform further processing\
    \ or utilize the decrypted data as needed.\nAppl. Sci. 2023, 13, 9165\n20 of 28\n\
    4.5. Video/Image Transmission and Processing Algorithm\nAdditionally, to the discussion\
    \ about the contributions of MCC, IoT, and Monitoring,\nin this subsection, we\
    \ will try to correlate the available connections that provide the\npossibilities\
    \ for accessing video/images that are transmitted and processed through a\nCloud-based\
    \ Monitoring system. Based on the related review and all the contributions\nthat\
    \ progressed previously, we sum up to the conclusion that the better way to contact\n\
    video/images that are transmitted and processed through a Cloud-based Monitoring\n\
    system will be through a new algorithm approach.\nRelying on the previous works\
    \ of Psannis et al. [32] and Balasubramanian et al. [72],\nand the whole related\
    \ works we studied, we can approach the video/image transmission\nand processing\
    \ with the following equation:\nbnext\nk+1 = b f irst\nk\n∗ [x ∗ ( f (Tk + . .\
    \ . + Tk−1)\n+g(PLk, PLk−1) + h(Sk + . . . + Sk−1))] + b f irst−1\nk−1\n(1)\n\
    In the above Equation (1) x represents a stable that highlights the signiﬁcance\
    \ of each\ncomponent, f, g, and h are three functions that compare the modiﬁcations\
    \ in each factor’s\nvalue to the ﬁrst time window. Additionally, PL represents\
    \ the value of the packet loss rate, T\nrepresents the value of the Round Trip\
    \ Time, S represents the value of the signal-to-interference\nand noise ratio,\
    \ and k represents the value of the sequence number of the current time window.\n\
    In the end, b f irst\nk\nrepresents the value of the bandwidth of the ﬁrst time\
    \ window, b f irst−1\nk−1\nrepresents the value of the bandwidth of the ﬁrst time\
    \ window-1, and bnext\nk+1 represents the value\nof the bandwidth of the next\
    \ time window, which is the time we need.\nCounting on Equation (1) that we ended\
    \ up with in our proposal, we can determine\nan algorithm that implements Equation\
    \ (1). Another term that we combine with our\nEquation (1) to achieve the proposed\
    \ algorithm is TW, which represents the value of the\nTime Window. Moreover, we\
    \ will also use LoK and LoA, which represent the value of the\nLayer of Keystone\
    \ and the value of the Layer of Absorption, respectively. The proposed\nalgorithm\
    \ is presented in (Algorithm 2).\nSpeciﬁcally, Algorithm 2 represents the whole\
    \ procedure implemented by our pro-\nposed Equation (1), consisting of our study\
    \ on previous works [6,10,11,66,73]. As a result,\nin Algorithm 2, we compare\
    \ the data from the First Time Window to the functions that\ndepict the change\
    \ in the value of each component of Equation (1). The suggested algorithm\n“calls”\
    \ the value of the Packet Loss Rate, Round Trip Time, Signal to Interface, and\
    \ Noise Ratio\nof each loop in a limited number of loops while the time is “paused”,\
    \ all from the client\nthat transmits and/or analyzes the video/image. Continuously,\
    \ counting on Equation\n(1), the algorithm calculates a better way to transmit\
    \ and/or process the video/image by\nchoosing a calculation scenario relying on\
    \ the type of the transmitted and/or processed\nvideo/image. Inside a loop function,\
    \ which is repeated until the value of bLoA is greater or\nequal than the value\
    \ of bnext\nk+1, the calculation takes as many times as the random variable x\n\
    is greater or equal to the value k, which is the sequence number of the particular\
    \ transmis-\nsion/procession. When the loop function ends, the particular video/image\
    \ starts to be\ntransmitted/processed to the client. Due to the requirement for\
    \ a rapid response to the\nclient’s request, the proposed algorithm’s process\
    \ is predicted to take less than one minute.\nThe input of Algorithm 2 is based\
    \ on three values that are necessary for the operation\nof the algorithm; ﬁrst,\
    \ the value of the packet loss rate (PL) count on the sequence number\n(k) of\
    \ each round; second, the value of the round trip time count on the sequence number\n\
    (k) of each round; and third, the value of the signal-to-interference and noise\
    \ ratio count on\nthe sequence number (k) of each round. Additionally, as an input,\
    \ Algorithm 2 obtains any\nadditional information added from each user of the\
    \ system. On the other hand, the output\nof Algorithm 2 extracts the transmission\
    \ data of the video/image transmitted each time\nthrough the system.\nThe proposed\
    \ algorithm is evaluated through a Digital Twin scenario, simulating\nvirtual\
    \ Cloud-Servers and a Smart Hospital installation in which data produced from\
    \ a\nAppl. Sci. 2023, 13, 9165\n21 of 28\nmonitoring system is transferred, managed,\
    \ and processed [73–76]. For the Digital Twin\nscenario, we used CloudSim and\
    \ Cooja Contiki to simulate our proposed system and\nalgorithm.\nWe tested several\
    \ scenarios on CloudSim to see how computationally complex the\nsuggested approach\
    \ is. The amount of time and data used in each situation varies. As we\ncould\
    \ see from the experimental ﬁndings in the next Section, our concept was evaluated\
    \ for\na various period of time and for a variety of energy consumption situations\
    \ that employed\nand generated data.\nAlgorithm 2: Digital Twin scenario of video/images\

    5. Experimental Results & Analysis\nThis section presents the experimental analysis\
    \ and the discussion of the experimental\nresults of our Digital Twin scenario.\
    \ To verify the better use of our proposal and to test\nits performance, we made\
    \ a variety of measurements so that we could assess our level of\neffort. With\
    \ the following experiments, we can show the importance of the Digital Twin\n\
    scenario for such systems that use large-scale data streamed through the network.\n\
    Figure 5 illustrates the data produced and transmitted through the procedure using\n\
    the proposed algorithm and a conventional algorithm. The blue line represents\
    \ the results\nof the conventional algorithm and the green line represents the\
    \ results of the proposed\nalgorithm. As we can observe, our proposal could be\
    \ more efﬁcient because it could\nproduce and transmit more data sets at the same\
    \ time compared with the conventional\nalgorithm. The impact of our proposed model\
    \ depicts the efﬁciency of the usage of a Cloud\nManagement System operated over\
    \ a Digital Twin scenario, using real-time large-scale data\nproduced from the\
    \ connected IoT system.\nThe Digital Twins concept is most frequently used to\
    \ better “predict” functionality\nthrough a virtual model designed to accurately\
    \ reﬂect a physical object. Through such a\nsystem, useful information could be\
    \ extracted about its reliability and its usage, as well as\nthe degree of improvement\
    \ of the existing system/object [73,76].\nAppl. Sci. 2023, 13, 9165\n22 of 28\n\

    \ results section, we can observe that\nthe algorithm proposed in our work offers\
    \ a more secure transmission of the data through\ntime, and offers larger amounts\
    \ of data used and transmitted in the communication channel.\nWith this, we can\
    \ have a more reliable and secure IoT-based Healthcare Monitoring system\nin the\
    \ Cloud, which uses all the advantages of the involved technologies to the maximum.\n\
    Furthermore, we can observe that the operation of the proposed scenario as a Digital\
    \ Twin\nscenario offers a more sustainable and energy-efﬁcient system.\nTo attain\
    \ the best outcomes in its utilization, we advise combining the Internet of\n\
    Things with video monitoring technologies in future investigations. Additionally,\
    \ as a\nresult of this research, we would further examine the types of monitoring\
    \ that could beneﬁt\nfrom the Internet of Things contribution to technology. Since\
    \ MCC serves as the foundation\nfor both IoT and monitoring, we can assert that\
    \ the former enhances IoT functionality and\nhas an impact on different types\
    \ of monitoring technologies. Finally, as we can deduct from\nFigures 2 and 4\
    \ that a huge and vital issue for future study is the data security of video\n\
    monitoring through Cloud and IoT environments. Thus, there is a strong need of\
    \ further\nresearch in this area and, due to this, we are planning to overcome\
    \ all the difﬁculties to\nestablish a system like the one proposed for buildings,\
    \ such as small hospitals or small\nschools, in order to examine the operation\
    \ of our proposed scenario.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, C.L.S.;\

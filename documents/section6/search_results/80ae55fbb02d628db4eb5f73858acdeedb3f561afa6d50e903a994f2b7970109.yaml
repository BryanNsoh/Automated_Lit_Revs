    \ is central to the economy of the world, with sixty percent of the \npopulation\
    \ depending on it for survival. Farmers are adopting smart farming technics to\
    \ \nmake agricultural practices more efficient. Smart farming takes advantage\
    \ of Internet of \nThings (IoT) technologies for performing tasks such as moisture\
    \ sensing, weeding, \nkeeping vigilance, spraying, bird and animal scaring, smart\
    \ irrigation controls, the use of \nreal time field data for intelligent decision\
    \ making and smart warehouse management \nwhich includes theft detection and temperature\
    \ and humidity maintenance of the \nwarehouse. Smart devices such as watches,\
    \ computers or cellphones connected to the \ninternet can then be used to control\
    \ the smart farming system. Smart farming being at \nnascent stage, its privacy\
    \ and security needs to be researched and explored as its future \npartially dependent\
    \ on the resolution of the privacy and security issues associated. This \npaper\
    \ comprehensively reviews various security and privacy issues and challenges \n\
    associated with IoT deployments in smart farming. Following a structured approach,\
    \ a \nframework for smart farming security and privacy was developed in an attempt\
    \ to address \nchallenges experienced/expected. This framework can also be used\
    \ for future directions \nfor any IoT related privacy and security initiatives.\
    \ \n1 Introduction \nThe growth in global population is leading to increased food\
    \ requirement needs of the modern-day \ncivilization requires increased food production.\
    \ Unfortunately, traditional farming methods with low \nyields for fruit and crops\
    \ are still predominantly used. But wherever automation has been implemented,\
    \ \nyield improvement has been evident (Gondchawar & Kawitkar, 2016). This highlights\
    \ the need to \nintroduce modern technologies to the agriculture sector to achieve\
    \ better yields.  \n \nThe new technologies and solutions being implemented in\
    \ agriculture increase efficiency in methods \nfor gathering and processing data\
    \ while enhancing net productivity (Ray, 2017). On the other hand, the \nKalpa\
    \ Publications in Computing\nVolume 12, 2019, Pages 95–104\nProceedings of 4th\
    \ International Conference on the\nInternet, Cyber Security and Information Systems\
    \ 2019\nK. Njenga (ed.), ICICIS 2019 (Kalpa Publications in Computing, vol. 12),\
    \ pp. 95–104\nwater crisis and alarming climate change require new and improved\
    \ methods of farming. Automation \nand intelligent decision making technologies\
    \ are therefore also important in accomplishing this mission \n(Fan TongKe, 2013).\
    \ Amongst technologies that are making it possible are; IoT, remote sensing, \n\
    ubiquitous computing, cloud computing, Radio Frequency Identifier and wireless\
    \ and sensor networks \n(Ray, 2017).  \n \nHowever, this study only focuses on\
    \ IoT, which is “a collection of many interconnected objects, \nservices, humans,\
    \ and devices that can communicate, share data, and information to achieve a common\
    \ \ngoal in different areas and applications. IoT is fast tracked by the rapid\
    \ growth in nanotechnology which \nenables production of small and cheap sensors.\
    \ This has brought about great potential towards faster \ndecision making and\
    \ automation in the agriculture industry in the following smart farming techniques:\
    \ \n(automated irrigation scheduling (Reche, Sendra, Díaz, & Lloret, 2015), precision\
    \ agriculture (Barcelo-\nOrdinas, Chanet, Hou, & García-Vidal, 2013; Ray, 2017),\
    \ optimization of plant growth (Hwang, Shin, \n& Yoe, 2010), green-house monitoring\
    \ (Mao, Miao, He, Li, & Liu, 2012), farm land monitoring (Corke \net al., 2010),\
    \ and farming production process management (Dong, Vuran, & Irmak, 2013)). This\
    \ rapid \ndevelopment in the Internet of Things in agriculture has propelled the\
    \ phenomenon that is called Smart \nFarming (Sundmaeker, Verdouw, Wolfert, & Freire,\
    \ 2016).  \n \nAlthough smart farming promotes the increase of yields, reduces\
    \ operating costs, and increases \nagility, its unique architecture raises numerous\
    \ security and privacy concerns. The huge amounts of \ndata that are shared in\
    \ IoT-enabled environments can be harnessed by malicious applications that can\
    \ \nuse to the disadvantage of some aspect of smart farming. Thus, understanding\
    \ and minimization of these \nsecurity and privacy risks by the development of\
    \ efficient and effective cybersecurity solutions is \ncritical for the success\
    \ of smart farming initiatives. Since both IoT and smart farming are relatively\
    \ new \nphenomena, their knowledge concerning security and privacy implications\
    \ is not widespread as \nexpected. Some authors have labeled these technologies\
    \ as “technology hypes that may fail to \nmaterialize.” (Fenn & LeHong, 2011).\
    \  \n \nThis research paper provides insight into smart farming and goes on to\
    \ identify the most important \nsecurity and privacy challenges they expose farmers\
    \ to. Lastly, we introduce a framework to help \nmitigate the smart farming security\
    \ and privacy challenges exposed. We acknowledge both technical \nand human security\
    \ and privacy challenges, however, the paper mainly focuses on the human aspect\
    \ of \nprivacy and security in smart farming because it seems as though not enough\
    \ research has been done. \nIn line with that, this paper seeks to answer the\
    \ following research questions:  \n1. What are the privacy and security issues\
    \ in IoT?  \n2. How do humans affect the privacy and security of IoT initiatives?\
    \  \n3. How can the impact of human weakness in the privacy and security of IoT\
    \ be reduced?  \n \nThe remainder of this paper is structured as follows; firstly,\
    \ it will highlight the contribution of this \nstudy, it will then discuss a review\
    \ of related literature after which it will provide the brief methodology \nfor\
    \ the research followed by a description of the proposed framework. The last section\
    \ will conclude \nand provide recommendations for further research and actions.\
    \ \n2  Related Literature \nAgriculture has seen three revolutions already, from\
    \ plants animal domestication a few thousand \nyears ago, systematic crop rotational\
    \ methods of a few hundred years ago and the “green revolution” \nwhich came with\
    \ the use of fertilizers, pesticides, genetic modifications and introduction of\
    \ systematic \nbreeding a few decades ago (Walter, Finger, Huber, & Buchmann,\
    \ 2017). We suggest that agriculture \nIoT Security and Privacy: Turning on the\
    \ Human Firewall in Smart Farming\nGundu and Maronga\n96\nis undergoing a fourth\
    \ revolution triggered by the increasing population that in turn is increasing\
    \ the \ndemand of food. Ray (2017) warns that the growth rate in food production\
    \ is not at par with the food \nrequired by the growing population. The Food and\
    \ Agriculture Organization of the United Nations \n(How to Feed the World in 2050)\
    \ recently published a report showing a prediction of global food \nrequirements\
    \ reaching 3 billion tons by 2050 from 1.5 billion in 2015. This calls for an\
    \ exploration of \nnew and modern technologies that can be used in agricultural\
    \ applications to achieve the target. As a \nresult, this is accelerating the\
    \ incorporation of sensors and IoT into agriculture, giving birth to smart \n\
    farming. \n \n2.1 Internet of Things (IoT) \n \nIoT is rapidly gaining momentum\
    \ in modern wireless telecommunications. The basic IoT concept \nlays around connection\
    \ and use of a variety of technologies (such as Radio-Frequency IDentification\
    \ \n(RFID) tags, sensors, computers, actuators, smart watches, mobile phones,\
    \ etc.). These technologies \ninteract with each other through unique addressing\
    \ schemes to achieve common goals (Pecorella, \nPierucci, & Nizzi, 2018). The\
    \ integration of IoT with humans can take advantage of collaboration and \ntechnical\
    \ analytics to achieve real-time decision making (Angelini, Mugellini, Abou Khaled,\
    \ & \nCouture, 2018; Ray, 2017). IERC (‘IERC-European Research Cluster on the\
    \ Internet of Things’, 2014) \nwhich seems to have the most cited definition,\
    \ defines IoT as follows: “A dynamic global network \ninfrastructure with self-configuring\
    \ capabilities based on standard and interoperable communication \nprotocols where\
    \ physical and virtual ‘things’ have identities, physical attributes, and virtual\
    \ \npersonalities and use intelligent interfaces, and are seamlessly integrated\
    \ into the information network, \noften communicate data associate with users\
    \ and their environments.” \n \n2.2 Smart Farming \nSmart farming is the use of\
    \ modern technology to improve the amount and quality of agricultural \nproducts.\
    \ Walter et al (Walter et al., 2017) advocates that, apart from the use of intelligent\
    \ sensors, \nsmart farming  also encompasses the use of robotic vehicles (e.g.\
    \ for application of fertilizer, weeding \nand fruit harvesting). They also elaborate\
    \ that the drones with autonomous flight control, bundled with \npowerful hyperspectral\
    \ and high-resolution cameras are also being used to calculate biomass \ndevelopment\
    \ and fertilization status of crops, is another form of sophisticated smart farming.\
    \ Another \ncommon form of smart farming innovation is virtual fencing technologies\
    \ which assist cattle herd \nmanagement by the use of Global Positioning System\
    \ Sensors (GPS) sensors attached to the livestock \nand monitored on computer\
    \ or smart phones. This management can also be achieved by the use of real \n\
    time remote-sensing signals. Combined, these technical improvements discussed\
    \ constitute a technical \nrevolution that can generate positive changes in agricultural\
    \ practices. These trends for farming are not \nonly applicable to developed countries\
    \ but also to developing countries, especially where deployments \nin ICT (e.g.,\
    \ use of smart phones, access to the Internet) are being adopted at a rapid pace.\
    \ The rapid \ndecrease in price for IoT based sensors for smart farming solutions\
    \ is also opening a possibility for \nsmart faming initiatives in emerging economies\
    \ as the farmers can also afford them (Ray, 2017). \n \nSmart farming reduces\
    \ the ecological footprint of farming due to efficient site-specific application\
    \ \nof inputs, such as fertilizers and pesticides. This makes agriculture more\
    \ profitable for the farmer as \nresource inputs would have been decreased. It\
    \ also assists with mitigation of leaching problems as well \nas greenhouse gas\
    \ emissions (Mahmoud, Yousuf, Aloul, & Zualkernan, 2015) and increase reliability\
    \ \nof spatially explicit data which will ultimately reduce farming risks. Optimal,\
    \ yield projections, site-\nIoT Security and Privacy: Turning on the Human Firewall\
    \ in Smart Farming\nGundu and Maronga\n97\nspecific weather forecasts, and diseases\
    \ and disasters probability maps based on weather and climate \ndata will help\
    \ plan and optimize cultivation of crops (Walter et al., 2017). With the IoT,\
    \ it is possible \nto create a sensor network allowing for almost continuous monitoring\
    \ of the farm reducing the time \nneeded for surveillance.  \n \nIn principle,\
    \ optimization of farming activities due to smart farming should lead to better\
    \ product \nquality (e.g., watering an orchard when the moisture level has not\
    \ dropped too much, produces better \njuicier fruits or better-quality milk produced\
    \ by individualized feeding of cattle). Better quality products \nare not only\
    \ healthier but also generate more profits as they sell at higher prices.  \n\
    \ \nBecause there are numerous players in smart farming, this introduces a challenge\
    \ of accountability \nfor malpractice or mistakes that may lead to environmental\
    \ and/or economic consequences. For \nexample, it is difficult to establish the\
    \ source of the problem if a consumer gets sick from eating \nharvested fruits\
    \ that still had traces of fertilizer or pesticides because it was applied too\
    \ late. Should the \nblame be on the farmer, or the software vendor, or the network\
    \ provider, or the manufacturer of the \nsensor? As at the time of publishing\
    \ of this paper, there is no straightforward answer to address such an \nincident.\
    \  Another challenge is that smart farming can lead to serious disease outbreaks\
    \ if not monitored \nproperly. Efficient use of fungicide in a smart farming environment\
    \ may delay disease outbreaks which \nthen increases the risk of creating fungicide\
    \ resistant traits which is even more devastating. \n \nContrary to the view that\
    \ the automation in smart farming eliminates the need of human labor \ntherefore\
    \ increases the unemployment rate, this whole process will always require humans\
    \ however at \na much higher intelligent level. Machines will only conduct the\
    \ monotonous and tiring operational \nactivities (Walter et al., 2017). \n \n\
    2.3 Security and Privacy \nWe will discuss the security and privacy challenges\
    \ of smart farming as well as those of IoT in \ngeneral as they also filter into\
    \ smart farming. These challenges can be broadly divided into technological \n\
    challenges and human challenges (Gundu, Flowerday, & Renaud, 2019; Mahmoud et\
    \ al., 2015). The \ntechnological challenges in smart farming mainly arise due\
    \ to its heterogeneous and ubiquitous nature. \nIf magnified closer, these challenges\
    \ have to do with wireless technologies, scalability and energy.  The \nhuman\
    \ challenges are related to the awareness and knowledge of principles and functionalities\
    \ that \nshould be followed to achieve and maintain a secure smart farming environment.\
    \ These human \nchallenges evolve around the ability to ensure security by authentication,\
    \ confidentiality, end-to-end \nsecurity, integrity etc. (Mahmoud et al., 2015).\
    \ \n \nIn the recent years, there has been a lot of effort attempting to address\
    \ security and privacy issues \nsmart paradigms (Alaba, Othman, Hashem, & Alotaibi,\
    \ 2017; Cho, Cho, Shin, Park, & Lee, 2012; Corke \net al., 2010; Fagade & Tryfonas,\
    \ 2016; Granjal, Monteiro, & Sa Silva, 2015; Hwang et al., 2010; \nOleshchuk,\
    \ 2009; Pecorella et al., 2018; Zhou, Cao, Dong, & Vasilakos, 2017). Collectively,\
    \ the authors \ntouch on trust management, authentication, intrusion detection\
    \ systems, privacy issues, data security, \nnetwork security, access control systems,\
    \ fault tolerance and digital forensics. An IoT project requires \nsome form of\
    \ trust, privacy, and security model implementation. This model should address\
    \ data \nintegrity, confidentiality and end-to-end communication issues. To probe\
    \ into data misuse, the model \nshould also address access policies and encrypting\
    \ mechanisms to be used.  \n \nThe classic security goals of Confidentiality,\
    \ Integrity and Availability (CIA) of any cyber system \nalso apply to IoT. However,\
    \ IoT based smart systems have other restrictions and limitations. These are \n\
    IoT Security and Privacy: Turning on the Human Firewall in Smart Farming\nGundu\
    \ and Maronga\n98\nprimarily due to computational power limitations of the devices\
    \ and the heterogonous and ubiquitous \nnature of IoT. To address that, we suggest\
    \ authentication, lightweight solutions, heterogeneity, policies \nand key management\
    \ systems to be added to the traditional CIA triad, which will be discussed below.\
    \ \n \nSecurity and privacy issues that may arise due to weaknesses of the human\
    \ in smart farming are \ninterception, node capture attack, dos attack, man-in-the-middle\
    \ attack and data theft. Technological \nissues include compatibility, wireless\
    \ signal strength, storage capacity, power consumption, and \ncomputation capability.\
    \ In general, when designing IoT applications it is important to take the following\
    \ \ninto account: how will different users interact with the devices, how much\
    \ data will be revealed and \nwho will be managing the applications. Therefore,\
    \ users should have tools that control data to be \ndisclosed, by whom and when\
    \ (Mahmoud et al., 2015). \n \n \n3 Contribution \nThis paper contributes to the\
    \ body of knowledge as follows.  \n \nAnalysis of the advantages of smart farming.\
    \  \n \nAnalysis of privacy and security issues related to IoT and smart farming\
    \ deployments with \nrespect to the human aspect. \n \nDevelopment of a framework\
    \ that can be followed to reduce the effect of the human \nweakness in terms of\
    \ privacy and security of smart farming. \n \n \n4 Methodology \nIn order to address\
    \ the research questions outlined in the Introduction, we reviewed literature\
    \ from \nJanuary 2009 to January 2019. This review period was chosen due to the\
    \ fact that IoT and smart farming \nare recent phenomena, hence as a practical\
    \ consideration we did not expect to access older studies \nwithin articles prior\
    \ to 2009. Apart from inclusion by period of publication, we also used two other\
    \ \ninclusion criteria for the literature search. These encompassed whether it\
    \ was a full article publication \nand its relevance to the research questions.\
    \ Exclusion of previous literature was also based on two \ndifferent criteria:\
    \ either the articles were not published in English or the articles focused solely\
    \ on \ntechnological designs. The literature survey was undertaken using the following\
    \ systematic approach: \na search on two major bibliographical databases was carried\
    \ out, on Science Direct and Scopus. This \nsearch was conducted using a combinations\
    \ of keywords which were separated into two groups, the \nfirst addressing Smart\
    \ Farming (i.e. precision farming, agri-food, sensor-driven innovation, \ntechnologies\
    \ in farming, internet of things, IoT) and the second group focusing on cybersecurity\
    \ (i.e. \nhuman centered security, awareness campaigns, training). The choice\
    \ of the two databases was based \non their wide coverage of relevant literature\
    \ and their capability to suggest related articles or citations. \nA total of\
    \ 359 peer-reviewed articles were retrieved from the two databases. These were\
    \ filtered by \nscanning for relevance. This involved identifying sections of\
    \ the text that address the research questions. \nFollowed by screening, where,\
    \ the search function was used to locate the paragraphs containing the key \n\
    words. We then analyzed the text to identify links to our research questions.\
    \  \n \nIoT Security and Privacy: Turning on the Human Firewall in Smart Farming\n\
    Gundu and Maronga\n99\nWe used Zotero reference management software to manage\
    \ the articles and eventually, 21 articles \nwere considered as very relevant\
    \ and 93 as relatively relevant. The remainder of the articles were \nirrelevant\
    \ and excluded from this analysis because they did not speak to smart farming\
    \ or cybersecurity. \nThe number of relevant peer reviewed literature was very\
    \ low; however, this was not surprising as IoT \nand Smart Farming are relatively\
    \ new concepts. Their applications are rapidly evolvingpeer reviewed \narticles\
    \ are lagging behind as usually the case with most technologies. This led to the\
    \ decision to also \ninclude grey literature into the review. This comprised using\
    \ Google Scholar and LexisNexis search \nengine. Thus, we managed to obtain magazines,\
    \ reports, blogs, and other web-items. This resulted in \n213 magazine articles,\
    \ 4 reports, 119 blogs and 19 items on twitter. Each of the 119 blogs had their\
    \ title \nand sentences scanned for relevance and duplicated blogs were removed.\
    \ As a result, 21 blogs were \nselected for additional evaluation through further\
    \ reading. Eventually, 7 blogs were considered as \ncontaining relevant information\
    \ for our study. Each of the 213 magazine articles was similarly evaluated \n\
    and 9 articles were considered as containing relevant information. The analysis\
    \ and synthesis of the \nliterature led to the development of the framework presented\
    \ in the next section. \n5 Proposed Framework \nThis paper argues that for the\
    \ technological security measures put in place to be effective, the user \nof\
    \ the system should be aware of the security risks associated and how to behave\
    \ securely. Technology \nshould complement and supplement the human element not\
    \ the other way around. The \ntechnological/physical firewall can be deemed useless\
    \ if the ‘human firewall’ is not turned on, as it is \nthe human who controls\
    \ the technology. In summary, we suggest that the human element is at the Centre\
    \ \nof any security and privacy initiative. \n \nThe proposed privacy and security\
    \ framework for smart farming in figure 1 has constructs guided \nby how literature\
    \ seems to address the human and technological aspects of privacy and security\
    \ attempts \nto highlight that enhanced security and privacy can only be achieved\
    \ by considering both technological \nand human aspects. \n \n5.1 Technology Aspect\
    \ \nAppropriate technological infrastructure is essential in making smart farming\
    \ systems function. \nAlthough literature does not have much information on infrastructures\
    \ being used, the few mentioned \nare supplied by large venture capital vendors\
    \ such as AGCO, John Deere, KAA IoT, ThingsWorkx, \nBlue River Technologies, Thingsboard.io\
    \ and Monsanto. However, the demands of the fourth industrial \nEnhanced Smart\
    \ Farming Security & Privacy \nFigure 1: A privacy and security framework for\
    \ smart farming \nAwareness & Training \nHuman \nAspect \nTechnology \nAspect\
    \ \nVendor \nIoT Security and Privacy: Turning on the Human Firewall in Smart\
    \ Farming\nGundu and Maronga\n100\nrevolution particularly smart farming are now\
    \ attracting organizations that were previously not active \nin traditional agriculture.\
    \ For example, a Japanese technology firm (Fujitsu) now hosts cloud-based \nfarming\
    \ systems. In North America, there are several initiatives for example the facilitation\
    \ of data \nacquisition via an open-source hardware platform and software libraries\
    \ known as the ISOBlue project \nand the Open Ag Toolkit (OpenATK) (Ray, 2017)\
    \ In Europe, FIWARE was developed. It is for cloud \nhosting, data management,\
    \ provision of IoT services, cybersecurity and analysis of Big Data (Wolfert,\
    \ \nGe, Verdouw, & Bogaardt, 2017).  \n \nSince, devices (sensors, computers,\
    \ cellphones, routers, etc.) in smart farming are manufactured and \ndistributed\
    \ by different vendors, trust should be established between them and the farmers.\
    \ For this to \nhappen the devices they supply should be technically secure. This\
    \ leaves the aspect of the technological \naspect of privacy and security primarily\
    \ on the vendors. However, these vendors should train the \nfarmers on the use\
    \ of their devices and advise them on possible risks and how to use the devices\
    \ \nsecurely.  \n \n5.2 Human Aspect \nThe challenge for smart farming is to ensure\
    \ awareness of security and privacy to the farmers and \ntheir employees and also\
    \ to ensure that they are trained on how to implement safety in their daily \n\
    routines in a consistent manner. Technical security controls may only assist in\
    \ reducing the threat of \nmalicious people such as hackers, competitors or disgruntled\
    \ employees. However, the defense against \nnaïvetés and lacking understanding\
    \ necessary to safeguard the smart farming system may be achieved \nby vigorous\
    \ security awareness and training programs.  \n \nThe trusted human (employee)\
    \ typically has unregulated access to some part or else parts of the \nsmart farming\
    \ system. This makes it possible for a naive farmer or employee to breach security\
    \ and \nprivacy measures put in place from within the system’s perimeter defenses\
    \ without triggering the \nperimeter defenses alarm (Gundu, 2012). On the other\
    \ hand, outside attackers attempt to gain access \ninside a network either by\
    \ attacking the system directly or by exploiting the weaknesses of an employee.\
    \ \nThis research study focused on insiders only. The reason for this segregation\
    \ was that the insider threat \nis usually taken for granted and smart farming\
    \ often has limited measures in place to minimize the risk \nto which insiders\
    \ expose the farm as compared to that posed by outsiders with firewalls and physical\
    \ \nsecurity being used to guard against intruders. The hour it takes an employee\
    \ to view an awareness \npresentation may be the difference between a secure organization\
    \ and a multimillion Dollar breach of \nsecurity. \n \nWhat should be given great\
    \ attention is that most farmers and farm workers are not Information and \nCommunication\
    \ Technology (ICT) specialists. Hence, they might not be aware of the risks involved\
    \ in \na smart farming environment, and how those risks can be reduced. Farmers\
    \ and farm employees with \n‘little-to-no’ prior cyber security training or experience\
    \ may suddenly be responsible for hundreds of \nnetworked IoT devices generating\
    \ large amounts of data some which might be sensitive as part of their \njob The\
    \ weaknesses humans present can never be completely avoided, however, a properly\
    \ structured \ncybersecurity awareness campaign can lower the risk to tolerable\
    \ levels (Flowerday & Von Solms, \n2005; Gundu, 2017).   \n \nIn a smart farming\
    \ environment, everyone requires cybersecurity awareness training just as in the\
    \ \narmed forces, every soldier, regardless of their role, have to complete elementary\
    \ training. Hence, \ncybersecurity awareness among human users (farmers and farm\
    \ workers) is an important security \nmeasure for the success and growth of smart\
    \ farming. If humans lack awareness, they can make \nIoT Security and Privacy:\
    \ Turning on the Human Firewall in Smart Farming\nGundu and Maronga\n101\nmistakes\
    \ such as using default passwords that come with devices making it easy for hackers\
    \ to conduct \nattacks against the whole network (Mahmoud et al., 2015). \n6 Conclusions\
    \ and recommendations \nWith the global population prediction of 9.6 billion by\
    \ 2050, extreme weather condition challenges, \nclimate change, and resulting\
    \ environmental impact, there is great need to embrace IoT. Effective \nfarming\
    \ practices can address these issues. Currently, literature reports smart farming\
    \ applications are \ntaking place primarily in Europe and North America. However,\
    \ it reveals keen interest from Africa and \nAsia whose economies are primarily\
    \ based on agriculture.   \n \nEnsuring security and privacy is one of the biggest\
    \ challenges of smart farming governance to date. \nThis challenge might end up\
    \ inhibiting developments because farmers may be reluctant to share data as \n\
    they begin to fear that their data may end up in their competitors’ hands. Hence,\
    \ strong access controls \nmight be a starting point for vendors to build trust\
    \ with farmers. \n \nIn this paper a literature review on security and privacy\
    \ in smart farming was conducted. It was \nconcluded that IoT in smart farming\
    \ applications is still premature based on the limited peer reviewed \npublications.\
    \ However, it is evident that humans remain the weak link in smart farming security\
    \ and \nprivacy initiatives. Some farmers are lulled into a false sense of security\
    \ by IoT device vendors who \nvogue that technology is the total barrier to breaches.\
    \  Hence, this paper develops a framework to try to \nreduce the risk the human\
    \ exposes smart farming initiatives to. As we believe, it will be the most \n\
    effective way of switching on the human firewall that is making the human part\
    \ of the solution and not \nthe problem. The next step for this study is conduct\
    \ action research to test the effectiveness of the \nproposed model. Our main\
    \ recommendation for future research lies within analyzing whether Africa is \n\
    ready for smart farming in terms of security and privacy. \n \nReferences \n \n\
